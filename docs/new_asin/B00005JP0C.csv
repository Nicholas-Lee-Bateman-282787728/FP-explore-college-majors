1553311,4,B00005JP0C,"What I enjoyed most about ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is that it's an intelligent movie. It maintains a sense of humor without getting juvenile or patronizing, and in an odd sort of way, it indirectly teaches the audience a valuable life lesson. Specifically, it states that you should live the life you truly want to live. I know how hokey that sounds, considering most go to the movies to be entertained. They rarely go to be given a positive message. But this film had that kind of effect on me, and as strange as it may seem, I actually feel better for having seen it. I initially didn't think I could appreciate a story revolving around the fashion industry. I've never been a part of that world, and I have no idea if its representation in this movie is accurate. But as it progressed, I began to see the big picture, one that has nothing to do with fashion. It has to do with maintaining personal integrity in the midst of a cutthroat world.

In that sense, this movie can be viewed as a satire. But that may be too much of a stretch, because it's one of the subtlest satires I've ever seen. That's because nothing about it is over the top, despite the quirky circumstances and the one of a kind characters. Even Meryl Streep's performance as demonically career-oriented Miranda Priestly isn't overdone. However, her character does have some distinctly caricature-like qualities: she's the impatient, capricious, and cynical editor of the fashion magazine ""Runway,"" and she demands much out of her employees. Most of the time it's almost too much, and they are barely able to keep up. (Why else would she be notorious for firing assistants?) Yet she expresses herself quietly and calmly, as if she were completely emotionless. Granted, that kind of demeanor does nothing to lessen the tension her presence inevitably causes. Despite a dedicated staff, it seems that no one is capable of handling such a difficult person.

Then enters Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent college graduate who hopes a job at a magazine will help her on her way to becoming a journalist. The moment she enters the magazine's main New York office, she's bombarded by flurries of activity and demeaning remarks about her sense of fashion (which she receives a lot during the course of the movie). The first person she meets is Emily (Emily Blunt), an outwardly snobby but inwardly insecure British girl who has just been promoted to First Assistant. She clearly doesn't take Andy seriously, and she doesn't expect Miranda will, either. When Miranda and Andy meet for the first time, we're led to believe that Emily was right in how Miranda would feel. Before that day, Andy had never read ""Runway,"" nor did she know whom Miranda was. Why should she take part in a magazine she's completely unfamiliar with? Andy leaves the office feeling rejected, thinking it was a complete waste of time. So imagine her surprise when Emily stops her in the lobby and tells her she's been hired.

Thus begins an absolutely whirlwind journey for Andy. She's asked to do a multitude of menial tasks, such as bringing Miranda coffee, picking up articles of clothing, answering the phone, taking messages, and setting up various appointments (among other things). She quickly learns that everything has to be done perfectly and in a timely fashion. Any mishaps or delays meet with intense, ego-shattering criticism, not only from Miranda, but from the other employees, as well. Emily's attempts to brief Andy on technical skills and proper behavior are almost degrading, especially when she gloats about accompanying Miranda to Paris in the spring (for an important fashion show, no less). Encounters with Nigel (Stanley Tucci)--Miranda's wardrobe manager--almost always lead to wisecracks about Andy's figure (she's a size six, which is practically obese in the fashion world). However, their attacks actually do more to teach Andy than they do to defeat her. Gradually, she comes to understand just how this industry works, and to everyone's surprise, she adapts herself accordingly. She wears the correct clothing and dons the appropriate shoes, all the while working to earn the respect of her coworkers (and hopefully Miranda).

But there is one thing she fails to learn: she's paying a pretty high price for success. Being at the mercy of a ruthless boss is driving a wedge between her and her social life, especially when it comes to her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier). From his point of view, she's trying to make herself fit into a preconceived image, in turn making her forget who she really is. The Andy who wore regular, unfashionable street clothes was the woman he loved; she was fun, energetic, and she knew what she wanted to accomplish. But now she wears chic, expensive clothing with gaudy accessories, and she's too busy to spend time with anyone (it reaches a crescendo when she misses Nate's birthday). She's basically trying to reach an impossible standard of beauty, all in the name of success. She initially defends herself, but she eventually realizes that she's sold her soul to the Devil (hence the meaning behind the title).

That's when everything suddenly gets complicated for Andy, especially since Miranda is learning to trust her on a deeper level. She now has privileges most new assistants never come close to earning, including access to a mock up fashion book and no longer having to hang up Miranda's coat and bag. She's even offered Emily's ticket to Paris (I won't say if she actually accepts it). However, Andy is still expected to complete difficult tasks, all of which are getting more and more outrageous; at one point, Miranda asks her to obtain the unpublished manuscript of the next ""Harry Potter"" novel (a gift for her twin daughters who refuse wait for its actual publication). The time eventually comes when Andy has to seriously consider what she wants out of life. She also has to decide whom she wants to share it with; in light of the problems she's having with Nate, she finds herself attracted to Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), the seductive and high profile editor of another New York magazine.

All of the relationships in this movie--be it professional, romantic, or friendly--are complex, a quality I found appropriate given the way real relationships work. No one in this film is a flat, undeveloped stereotype. Even Miranda, as hardened as she is, has another side to her; you might even call it a softer side (but I'm using the word ""softer"" loosely, here). Hidden within these various sides is the key to understanding why the character interactions are so important. Essentially, they're important because everyone's concerned about their current lives and their futures. To give a few examples, Nate wants to be a chef, Emily wants to be respected, and Nigel wants the freedom to think for himself. To some extent, we root for all the characters.

But the one we root for the most is Andy, who wants nothing more than to continue writing articles as a real journalist. In witnessing her struggle with the fashion industry, we learn something valuable: we need to be true to ourselves if we want to achieve our goals. It's that aspect of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" that made it an enjoyable movie. While it may not be inspiring enough to change your life, it at least gets you to think about the direction your life is going in. I think everyone needs to do that from time to time. If it takes a movie of wit and wisdom to make that possible, then so be it.",1151625600,9,7486,4.848318999218139
1553312,3,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is based on Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel about a nice, ordinary young girl who experiences a drastic reality check when she takes a job with a large fashion magazine in New York City. Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) always dreamed of becoming a writer, but the only job she manages to land is a position at Runway magazine working as the second assistant to the editor-in-chief. To say that Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is an extremely difficult boss would be an understatement. She is cold, condescending, relentless, and impossibly demanding. Miranda can't understand why Andrea is unable to book her on a flight out of Miami even though the city is at the mercy of a hurricane and no flights are being allowed to take off. She also has no problem insisting that Andrea track down two copies of the new and UNPUBLISHED Harry Potter book...what's so hard about that?! Andrea soon learns that working for Miranda is a full-time job. Her phone is constantly ringing with Miranda-related emergencies, and Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) begins to suffer as a result.

Needless to say, working for Miranda turns Andrea's life upside down. Not only is she stuck working for the devil herself, but Andrea is completely out of place in the fashion world. Her wardrobe consists of baggy sweaters and scruffy ballet flats, but all the other girls at Runway show up to work in stiletto heels and Chanel dresses. Eventually, Andrea's coworker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) takes pity on her and helps her ""dress the part"" by providing her with designer samples from the magazine's clothing collection...but will a chic new look be enough to help Andrea survive in the evil fashion industry?

Overall, I think this movie was a pretty good adaptation of Weisberger's novel. Some things were changed in order to trim down the script and provide additional comic relief, but it wasn't anything major. However, the one major difference between the book and the movie is that Miranda shows signs of compassion and weakness in the film. Granted, they are very BRIEF moments of compassion and weakness, but as a result the character loses some of the viciousness that she possesses in the book. I was also disappointed by the way Andrea's relationship with fashion playboy Christian (Simon Baker) was handled in the film and the way the big Paris confrontation scene between Andrea and Miranda was completely toned down. My guess is that the producers didn't want to use the ""F"" word in a PG-13 film, but COME ON! Fans of the book were completely robbed of that magical moment.

Meryl Streep is by far the best thing about this movie...however, I think she's too good for this film. Nothing else about ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a match for Streep's excellent performance. I thought that Anne Hathaway was okay as Andrea, but she kind of annoyed me...of course, Andrea's character is kind of annoying in general, so maybe that's all it is. Still, I was expecting more. (At least the clothes were great, though! WOW! But Andrea gave her Paris clothes to EMILY?! What's up with that?! And Emily gets hit by a CAR?! WHY?! Why did they make such silly changes like that?!)

Overall, this movie is worth seeing if you enjoyed Weisberger's book. However, the best thing about the book is the character of Miranda, and I was disappointed that her nastiness was underplayed in the film (through no fault of Streep's...this is just a script issue).",1151625600,4,3477,4.888135593220339
1553313,5,B00005JP0C,"I viewed Devil Wears Prada at a sneak preview this evening courtesy of ebay.  Enjoyed it immensely.  Meryl Streep played the devil Miranda to perfection -- very real, believable. Anne Hathaway is great - in another ugly duckling to swan role.  If you like fashion, you'll enjoy watching this movie.  Two thumbs up!",1151625600,9,314,4.867924528301887
1553314,4,B00005JP0C,"I got to see a sneak preview of the movie and enjoyed it immensely! I am a HUGE fan of the book and of Lauren Weisberger, who I saw in 2004 at a book fair and hear her talk about the story behind the novel. I had been waiting for this since I heard Meryl Streep was playing Miranda and she does not disappoint. She was PERFECT! Anne Hathaway is a great Andrea and if you, like me, have read the book -- you see that they did a good job sticking to the book, not great. So if you've been wanting to read this fun novel about a young 20-something with a boss from hell, WAIT! See the movie first, then go back and read the book. You'll throughly enjoy seeing how hellish things really were at Runway.

Oh, and if you're into fashion, this is a MUST SEE!",1150416000,,751,4.006666666666667

1553566,1,B00005JP0C,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ......

I love Meryl Streep, but I absolutely hated this movie.

The title is wrong - - The word ""devil"" was nowhere in the entire movie.

This was a devil of a boss ? ? ?
That stupid woman, Andy, would not last five minutes with MY boss.

The boss never raised her voice,
never cursed,
and the only insult was the word ""fat"" one time.

Would you call your boss ""a devil"" when she takes you on a free trip to Paris, with a new wardrobe included?
My boss never even gave me a Christmas card.

It was understood at the job interview that the job was demanding and that the boss was particular.
Andy was warned from the beginning that she needed to ""survive"" and keep up.
The boss simply wanted Andy to do the job that she was hired for.
The boss has a lot of pressure and responsibility, which is why she actually needs two assistants.

Many of the boss's demands were ridiculous.
I think that was to keep Andy ""on her toes.""
Surely, the boss didn't really expect Andy to get that Harry Potter book (even though she actually did get it).
And, surely, the boss didn't expect Andy to get her on an airplane when no planes were taking off - -
Even if Andy could get her onto a flight under those conditions, why would she want to risk her life?

And, long before the trip to Paris, where did Andy get the money to buy
a whole new wardrobe of designer clothes, shoes, jewelry, and a complete makeover?
The bald guy gave her a small handful of clothes to keep, and ""that's all.""
Not to mention, where did she find the time to go shopping and get a makeover when her boss had her running around constantly?
She didn't have any time for her boyfriend, but she had time to do all that shopping?

I thought that Andy's one-night stand was out of character.

At the end of the movie, Andy is in a restaurant with her ex-boyfriend (whom she had been living with throughout the movie).
They agree to start dating again.
But, the boyfriend announces that he has just accepted a job in Boston and is immediately moving there.
And, later that day, Andy accepts a new job (there, in New York).
So, how are they going to start dating again when they will be living in different states, after they were used to living together?

Was the audience supposed to cheer when Andy finally quit?
She should have quit long before that, because she was so miserable.
And, she should have given two weeks' notice, not just walk off the job without a word.
She was lucky that she got any kind of a reference after leaving like that.
She should have let herself get fired because at least she could have collected Unemployment.
The movie does not show how much time passed between Andy quitting and getting the new job.",1517961600,,2707,4.340594059405941

She is mentored and guides past the competition by Nigel (Stanley Tucci.)

1554828,2,B00005JP0C,Have to say initially this movie is great. Love the actors and their work. The issue I have is the direction of the supporting characters. To say the Director and Producers in the making of this movie do not view females as equal to their male counter-parts. I felt Andy's character could of done so much more without bruising egos or stabbing one another in the back.,1470700800,,368,4.507462686567164

1554833,4,B00005JP0C,Overall this is a good movie. The chemistry between Ann Hathaway and Adrian Grenier is totally off. Frankly I don't like Adrian Garnier as actor and to top it off his role in this movie is terrible- very passive aggressive and unsupportive boyfriend- I hated it.

1554870,5,B00005JP0C,"Great movie. I got a lot of valuable insights from this movie. It's important to do your job and deal with the trials and tribulations that come with it. It's even more important be yourself and remain true to the education and family upbringing that brought you here in the 1st place. At least one (1) reviewer thought the boyfriend was worthless. I disagree, however one dimensional he might have seemed he was one of the few real people in the film. I don't know about other people but I grew up comfortably middle class in the city, but when I left my neighborhood I had to deal with people very different from myself. If I had said the things these ""fashion people"" said to this girl to people outside or even inside my neighborhood, I would not have survived. People demand and deserve respect, and in the city the consequences of making fun of someone different from you can be very painful, because in my city and in this life you never know who you're talking to.",1468454400,,972,4.466292134831461

1555065,5,B00005JP0C,"I gave this 5 stars but i have some major issues with certain aspects of the script.

I've worked for people like Ms. Priestly so I know what it's like. It's a maniacal NY thing so for those of you who think this is Mary Tyler Moore arriving in the Big Apple and throwing her hat up in the air, get over it.
......and Miranda is right about countless jobs and millions of dollars.......I have family who have worked in the industry behind the scenes and a grandmother who worked in a ILGWU sweatshop.......oh yea right, let's just take away all those people's livelihoods ........from the poor guys who push and haul clothing racks across the streets all day right down to the non union sweatshops because fashion is something people don't really ""need"". .........but they sure do want it.......and it pays the bills.

Andrea is young, very young and naive and idealistic, so I suppose she can be forgiven to a degree, but her character basically gets on my nerves; especially when she goes on about what people need and opposed to what they want.

Miranda gives Andrea far too much credit (in the final scene) for thinking that she (Andrea) understand what people want/need.
Andrea is IMHO a seriously stupid young woman (and I hated that black outfit).
Who in their right mind turns down Stanford Law!?

Did it ever occur to the ""smart fat girl"" that she should have gotten her degree and then done pro-bono work for good causes and made much more of an impact that way instead of writing boring, tiresome, self righteous news columns about the oppressed and disenfranchised?

Secondly, her photographer friend was quick to be very judgmental (at the art gallery exhibit) about Andrea's treatment of the boyfriend (Nate) accusing her of being a ""glamazon"".
Every artist I've ever known would have been kissing Andrea's butt for her connections and she didn't have any issues whatsoever about accepting the $1900.00 Mac Jacobs handbag earlier.

For some reason, Niles and co. never figured out that Miranda was not ""screwing"" Niles on purpose; it was simply fallout, and besides Niles was still Miranda's right hand so what's the big deal.

Miranda was shrewdly doing what she had to do to protect herself and in succeeding to do so saved Niles job as well.....and very likely Andrea's.

Miranda is portrayed as the consummate mover, shaker, deal maker who knows how to play the game in a tough merciless town and industry; her character is flawless but there were too many disconnects for me in the script regarding the other characters.",1465084800,,2539,4.807339449541284

Anne Hathaway is excellent, except for the not very believable stammering parts which we could have done without. Didn't like the boyfriend much, but loved Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci. A piece of fluff for sure, but it's a fun, guilty, pleasurable fluff which can be watched over and over. The message and ending was contradictory and didn't ring true (why NOT stay in a job you love, even if you are changing? Andy had accumulated enough of her own power by the end of the film that she could have chosen to stand up for herself AND kept the job and even put Miranda in her place.)  But alas, the film went another direction, which was not altogether wrong. Really, who cares? It wasn't meant to be taken seriously in the first place.",1464652800,3,907,4.463855421686747

Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a new journalism graduate who is hoping to start her career in New York City.  She lands a job at the fashion magazine Runway as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the woman who not only runs the magazine but wields her power over much of the fashion industry itself.

However, Andy isn't necessarily suited for the job.  Her fashion sense is definitely lacking, and she knows little of what Miranda asks of her.  Can she keep the job?  And what effect might the long demanding hours have on her relationships with her friends and her boyfriend?

Honestly, this is a very familiar story.  Youve got the nave newbie and the powerful mentor who has seen it all and demands perfection.  But that doesnt keep you from rooting for Andy.  As someone who has gotten new jobs recently, I felt sorry for Andy since she appeared to get so little training.  It was easy to root for her to figure things out and start to impress her new, demanding boss.  Of course, we do get to see the other side as her friends get very tired of her constantly changing plans for her job.  And it especially wears on her relationship with her boyfriend.

As I said, this is a familiar story.  The result found me wanting Andy to figure out a way to balance both her personal life and her new job.  The character is very likable and easy to root for, which gets us through a lot.

This was important to me since Im a guy.  Fashion?  Forget about it.  I couldn't have cared less about that aspect of the story, but of course it was just the setting that holds the rest of it together.

What really impressed me were some scenes near the end.  We get to see both sides of this coin as Miranda gives Andy a couple of peaks into her life.  Instead of being preachy, they come across as honest, which is so hard hitting it is impossible to turn away.

The acting propels us through the early parts and gets us to the payoff with no issues at all.  Meryl Streep is absolutely outstanding in the lead.  She makes Miranda much more complex than she appears from the very beginning.  In lesser hands, the final scenes wouldnt have felt real because we wouldnt have cared about the character.  Meanwhile, Anne Hathaway holds her own and really makes us care about Andy, which makes the entire journey worth taking.  The two leads are surrounded by a great supporting cast that includes Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, and Simon Baker.  These actors make their characters stand out no matter how big or small their parts on screen are.

Im glad I took advantage of the TV to watch The Devil Wears Prada.  While it doesnt break any new ground, the trip is well worth taking again with this cast playing these characters.",1462233600,,2974,4.3570127504553735

1555421,4,B00005JP0C,"So... this is the first EVER movie review I've written, and I watch a lot of movies on Amazon, but I just had to say this. I think personally this is a phenomenal movie. Anne Hathaway is a darling, Meryl Streep is INCREDIBLE, Stanley Tucci likeable, Emily Blunt moving, and most importantly... oh! The CLOTHES. The clothes.

BUT!

Spoiler Alert.

FEMINISM. HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. Fail.

But... I just can't get past the boyfriend. He looks like a cutie. He even acts the part at first. But seriously? That kind of lack of support by a guy for his girlfriend, who isn't being a jerk back, but honestly describing her struggles, and letting herself learn and love from the new experience of a job... and especially, being an apologizing, thinking, discussing, normal, figuring-things-out human being about it ... and then her supposed friends ONLY shame her or fake-nice her! Sucky friends! And especially, her boyfriend. He only says unkind things to her in that confrontation scene, and he never apologizes. She is kind, she invites his opinion, she expresses hers kindly, and she facilitates cordial dialogue, and even has the courage to ask for a break when he's being passive aggressive. She isn't being a jerk; he is. I don't blame her for walking out on her friend and him at first with ""are you going to shame me also"" look on her face... but wow, she turns around and actually listens and empathizes. She gets nothing back.

And I just can't feel okay that in the end, she apologizes, not him... and says ""HE'S RIGHT?"" Whoa. He doesn't even speak to her after that; she calls him up. That's just not okay. She wasn't wrong... he was shaming her about her choices instead of describing how *he* felt openly and taking responsibility as part of the relationship to figure out how to work or not work through it. It's like he was allowed to be a jerk because he was framed to be ""right.""

That default framing of someone to be ""right"" so that they can be a jerk and say whatever they want... super cliche and not up to par with the rest of the movie.

That's where it lost me. Such a cool, fascinating message... nuanced... seeing the multi-facetedness of even Miranda... in the end, Andrea welcoming her experiences and learning wholeheartedly from it, which I think is admirable, even if her job is not for ""forever."" While at the same time knowing when it's time to leave... I love that. She takes Nigel's advice and really puts herself into her job, and learns to love it and the people. It's not forever, but it's part of her life. She connects honestly with all the different characters... and it's so impactful. It really tears down the idea that you can write off people unilaterally, like she does in the beginning. I can't believe the boyfriend plays it up as good that she made fun of others or saw them as one-faceted... and that she says he is RIGHT? That's the only part of the movie that ruins it. So cliche and just wrong. Ruins an otherwise cool movie.

Plus, seriously guys. A woman ought to be allowed to experience changes, in dress, in way of seeing the world... and she shouldn't have to stay the exact same as she was before to please a guy. Not cool. Change and experimentation with new things is part of life and growing. And if it's hard for him, he should talk about it with her. NEVER shame her or make her life all about him.

Sorry, but all that just kind of ruined a five-star film for me, down to four. Had to rant about that. Don't go back, Anne Hathaway... keep learning and experiencing and find someone who is willing to stand by you and talk honestly about its impact on the relationship as you do it, not shame you if you change and try to force you back to who they need you to be. Yucky!",1459641600,22,3731,4.507396449704142

A guy who loves you should support what makes you happy! If he has any complaints or even use relationship to threaten you to choose between work or him. This is not the right one.

1555653,5,B00005JP0C,"Let me begin with a short summary of what this movie is about. Runway fashion magazine editor and chief Miranda Presley (played by Meryl Streep) is in need of a new second assistant, In charge of finding a new replacement is her current first assistant after many missteps Miranda goes over her assistants head and hires someone who she is not quite sure fits the role. Andy (played by Anne Hathaway), struggles to fit in among a group that she is no where near comfortable with. Through many mishaps and achievements she finally finds her place in the world.

Honestly, this is one of my all time favorite movies! I can't even begin to explain how much I love this movie. The acting is superb which should be expected when looking at the cast list.

1555791,3,B00005JP0C,"I read the book over vacation, not expecting to like it. I'm more of a fantasy/mystery kind of girl. And yet I couldn't put it down! The book was the highlight of my free time, and I expected the movie to be just as good. However, I was disappointed by how much they changed the plot. The book was perfectly adaptable. They could've kept every word and it would've been perfect. However, they changed so much that it was hardly recognizable. *SPOILERS FOR BOOK AND MOVIE AHEAD* The end of the book, which results in Andy telling Miranda to f*ck off, after which she goes back home to her family and spend time with her best friend (who played a huge part in the book, and was my favorite character). She also doesn't get back together with her boyfriend. There're also many bits in the middle of the book, like apartment searching and decorating, that gave it the realistic kick that such a hard to relate to book needed. The movie took away most of the grittiness of her life, as well as the most important people, plot points, and locations that I thought were crucial to the story. Andy is a strong female character, and the movie's ending made her more of a boyfriend dependent, nonchelant  character.
However, the movie was enjoyable, though fans of the book may find it less entertaining and realistic.
Keep in mind that I'm only twelve years old, and also that I'm a firm believer in staying true to the book.",1452297600,,1416,4.509727626459144

First the chef boyfriend is self centered. All he did was bitch about his girlfriend's demanding job and I can't imagine that they wouldn't fight and divorce in a long term relationship. The reality is that both individuals in a relationship need to work now and he showed lack of any sympathy for the demands on his girlfriend. The friends are so self serving that they received very generous gifts which they want and take and then repay her by making it hard for her to take her boss's phonecall and making fun of her. Her girlfriend imagines the worst about her and the newspaper man even when no transgressions have occurred. They all pass jugdement on her except the funnyone and they themselves are not above reproach.
I can believe it is that predatory in the fashtion industry because this is what the planet has become now, predators and slaves. I ''ve had a worse boss than Amanda Priestly who at least gave her a decent reference.

1556466,4,B00005JP0C,"Meryl Streep was so germane for the chic, soigne, and classy role of the fashionista Miranda Priestly, perfectly casted. Miranda was the editor in chief of Runway, a fashion magazine. She hired Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) as a beck and call, an assistant to answer the phone, get coffee, schedule appointments, run errands, etc., etc., etcetera. Due to Miranda's frenetic schedule, Andrea was importuned with myriad requests. Andrea had recently graduated from Northwestern University in Chicago. She, her boyfriend, and another couple moved to Manhattan. She wanted to be a journalist for a magazine publisher such as The New Yorker or Vanity Fair. Her taste in raiment and dishabille dress was deemed by her new employer and associates as banal and atrocious. She painstakingly jumped through hoops to get the fastidious Miranda's approval, and she completely updated her wardrobe (Dior dress, Chanel jacket and belt, Hemes bag, and Vivier shoes) and dropped from a size 6 to a dainty size 4. Her physical transformation was just stunning and the bling (jewelry from Graff or Van Cleef)! Majestic, pharaonic sights of the Big Apple and Paris, too!

1556788,5,B00005JP0C,"We in the United States like to believe that we reside in a country without royalty and nobility. The only people who think that there is true egalitarianism have never worked in the Entertainment and Media Industries. There is an aristocratic elite, no question, and it is not exactly made up of politicians (although there are some). It is largely composed of those who control media, particularly in television, film, radio, music, fashion, and print. They control what get's seen and what doesn't. When these people put on huge events that involve the press, cameras, and limousines, the public comes out to pay unquestioned homage to these elites, often on the sideline behind a barricade. With cameras flashing, these people are treated like the royalty of the 17th and 18th centuries. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" examines what is like to be in the inner circle of one of these elites.

In addition to the public's clamoring to glimpse these powerful elites, another segment of the population desires to become one of these people by trying to ""break into"" the media business. Since there are many more people who dream of being in these circles than there are spots available, this gives enormous power to those already on the inside, particularly those who have sway to either make or break an up-and-coming career. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" chronicles an aspiring journalist who lands a dream job that, she is told, ""thousands would kill for"": being the personal assistant to the editor of one of the largest fashion magazines, Runway, whose editor-in-chief makes Bill Gates seem like a softy. The character, Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep in a tour-de-force Oscar-nominated performance) is in fact modeled after real-life Vogue Magazine editor Anna Wintour whose chilling detachment from those around her, her ability to make or break fashion careers, and her cut-throat demands on her staff have become legendary throughout the fashion world.

In the film, the corporation that is ""Runway"" is no democracy. It is feudalism, with Mirander the absolute queen ruling over her dominion of serfs who constantly scatter about trying to please her. The central character, Andy Sachs, is plunged into this Madison Avenue purgatory without knowing the rules of the game. A journalism-major from Northwestern, Andy knows next to nothing about the fashion world, but it's not just the fashion world--it's the world of the elite in New York. Since everyone wants to gain favor from the higher-ups in order to step up the ladder, there's often over-the-top deference to those in elite positions. I half-expected her female assistants to curtsy when Mirander entered the office. Mirander knows perfectly-well her status and she uses it, often flaunts it, to her advantage. Her staff run around like castle servants anticipating the arrival of the Lady of the Manor.

Streep is magnificent as her voice never reaches past mezzo-piano. When one of her staff has transgressed, or simply cannot fulfill her expectation (I doubt Superman could hold a job there), in the softest tone possible she expresses her disappointment. And yet, the anticipation of her negative reaction is what makes for moments of anti-gravitational intensity. Of course, she never compliments anyone when they've done well. Excellent performance is taken for granted in this kingdom. I've never found the raging tyrant frightening. Rather, it is the even-tempered soft-spoken empress with absolute power who sends anyone who displeases her to the block with a disinterested wave of the figure that is the most terrifying.

At one point in the film, Andy chuckles when Miranda fusses over some seemingly identical-looking belts which of course spawns a lecture about how Andy's current wardrobe was in fact created by the fashion elite. This does point to another side of the fashion facade which I think may be the point of the film. If you take away the cameras, the celebrities, the allure, the models posing in museums wearing the latest by Christian Dior, at the end of the day all this is about is just jackets, belts, purses, skirts, dresses, and pants. I think one of the characters says as much. These clothes may look wonderful, even stunning, but that's all they are. They are lifeless pieces of fabric cut in a certain way to make the wearer look appealing but that's all it is. The fashion industry of course needs to perpetuate the idea that clothing is much more than clothing: that beautiful fashions will create fairy-tale existences for the purchasers. They are meant to represent a life of luxury and splendor and the purchase of these articles will bring you closer to that reality. When it doesn't, you need to buy more of these clothes. And you need to read Runway (aka Vogue) to tell you what you should buy. Of course, the only ones who actually have these fairy tale existences are the ones providing the clothes. Most of the people buying these fashions are still behind the barricade. Is there an irony here?",1433030400,2,5006,5.020457280385078
1556789,5,B00005JP0C,"Chutzpah.  Chutzpah, coupled with dedication and brilliance - and a tough skin.  No whining.  Channeling Miranda isn't the worst thing a woman could do.  But, is there only one ""Desk Set?""  Yes.  It IS possible for a woman not to bow and courtesy, and she needn't have just any ol' man.

Sadly, Andrea ultimately prefers to be average and immature, after an excellent break-through, too.  Yeah.  Turn down Stanford law because -- oh no - you couldn't be a writer and be a lawyer - tell John Grisham, etal.... Writing this is going to make it impossible to again rewatch the movie so I'll stop.  (She didn't get it that it is a GREAT thing she had ""nothing in common"" with the boyfriend anymore - his words.  What to expect from a guy who wears those collar-type t-shirts and can't shave because he's so 'cool').

Hathaway shines once her character has the grit to do the job.  Streep, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci are brilliant.  Patricia Field, costume designer, is brilliant.",1432684800,,979,4.649122807017544

Andy enters Miranda's world because she can't find anything else.  She learns the ropes and discovers she can succeed--if she is willing to sell her soul for power.

1557184,4,B00005JP0C,I really like this movie though I never read the book I think I will consider it for the future to compare the two. Not much of an Anne Hathaway fan for some irrational reason but I could stand her here because she seemed like the girl next door which I like. Meryl Streep definitely steals the show though in my opinion. She's a character whom you want to hate because she's just soo freaking mean but I can't help but feel some sympathy towards her. I have a deep appreciation for the fashion in this movie Anne Hathaway looked really stunning in most of the outfits she wore as well as Emily Blunt. Didn't really like the boyfriend's character in this movie he seemed kind of selfish like he can pursue his culinary dreams and she totally supports him but he's always bitching about her job. That got on my nerves a bit. Most importantly though this movie does have a message to it. The fashion world can definitely be very superficial and glamorous and enticing but you shouldn't lose yourself in it. That's why I love the ending because she just decides to leave that world and go back to her own humble own. That scene is truly very satisfactory when she abandons Meryl Streep in Paris can't help but smile and root for her.,1422057600,2,1230,4.422907488986784

1557226,2,B00005JP0C,"Spoiler Alert:  This review reveals much of the plot.

The plot is totally predictable---nice girl from the Midwest with all her virtues intact gets a glamour job in New York which turns her into everything she hates, but she looks very good in the process.  Her dorky boyfriend who has a lousy job feels left out and pouts a lot, which is supposed to indicate to us that he has kept his values while she has sold out.  Her other wannabe friends are no better.  She meets a way-too-cute and charming guy who takes her to bed in Paris.  But she comes to her senses, leaves him, throws her cell phone away and rushes back to her scrawny, whiny boyfriend.  He has, by this time, moved on up in his career.  She is genuinely happy for his achievement; too bad he never was for hers.  Fortunately he goes to Boston so I hope he's out of her hair.  She ends up with a job she likes and let's hope she finds a guy who is worthy of her.

Lots of nice clothes, shots of New York and Paris and some good performances from Ann Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci and Meryl Streep make this watchable.",1421625600,,1090,4.2682926829268295

1557387,5,B00005JP0C,"The Devil Wears Prada is a comedy drama that is a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel of the same title about a young woman who stumbles into the hectic worlds of high fashion and publishing. It stars Anne Hathaway as Andrea Sachs, a college graduate who goes to New York City and gets a job as a co-assistant to powerful fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep.

Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs is a bright young woman from the Midwest who has just graduated from college and wants to work as a magazine writer. She has applied for a job at ""Runway"", America's most prestigious fashion magazine. Though she has little to no interest in the garment trade, they are one of the only magazines in New York with a job opening working as a second assistant to editor Miranda Priestly. As she quickly learns, Miranda is a diva with plenty of power within the magazine business and she isn't afraid to use it, and though she lands the job, she soon learns that working for Miranda could test the patience of a saint thanks to her endless demands and refusal to acknowledge the end of a work day. She struggles to hold on to the job and her sanity, knowing that a recommendation from Miranda can open nearly any door at any magazine, but can she handle the pressure without losing her mind along the way?

The Devil Wears Prada is two films in one: a caustic, energetic satire of the fashion world and a cautionary melodrama. Also,the viewer gets an opportunity to witness Meryl Streep as a grand comedienne. Any other actress would have turned Miranda into a scenery-chewing Cruella, but Streep's underplayed, brilliant comic timing make her a fascinating, unapologetic character. This clever, funny big-screen adaptation of Weisberger's best-seller since it is a rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel and it is a witty expose of New York's fashion scene.",1419033600,,1910,4.784848484848485

However, it does drive one point home - most of the time we do have a choice about how we will react in a situation and, yet, willing to judge other's by the choices they make.

Anne Hathaway did a great job. Some viewers might feel that she was out shone by the other actresses, but that's not true. Anne's role was to be the normal (down to Earth) and slightly boring individual so that the other characters, and their peculiarities, could shine. It is strange, but Anne was a 'leading role' that was designed to serve as a supporting role.

Emily Blunt was another eccentric and perfect role. Her antics brightened up the movie with 'over the top' snobbishness that was equal parts condescending and hilarious.

Stanley Tucci portrayed his homosexual/designer/stereotype perfectly. He pushed forth a dignified tilted tone, with calm strength and a degree of helpful exasperation. The character was as equally snobbish as the rest, but brought a sense of badly needed mentoring to Anne's character, and the film.

This is a great 'chic' movie, but more importantly, it is a good movie to witness equally great acting.

I have loved this movie since the first time I saw It and have seen it many many times - never gets old to me!  Though this is an older movie, you can still feel the great couture atmosphere.  Meryl Streep is, as always superb in her role as the evil head of a fashion house and I love Ann Hathaway in ANYTHING she does.  She was honest, gorgeous and absolutely perfect for the role of the gawky, smart girl out of her element but eventually swept up in the world of glamour.  Add fabulous scenes of Paris and New York and I'm hooked!  I recommend this film for a great, not too heavy, curl up on a rainy night with popcorn chick flick.

Miranda (Meryl) wants it when she wants it and as is normally the case, it is already overdue when she makes a request! Anne Hathaway has her first job (albeit not in her journalistic field) and is trying to keep up with the demands of her boss.

Just watched this again and it still makes me laugh.  It is still as funny to me as it was when it hit the screen.  And, I still love to watch the interaction of the many people scurrying around trying to please Miranda.  To put it politely, trying to make the boss happy by doing whatever it takes!!

1558164,5,B00005JP0C,"I didn't know what to expect with this.  I got it because of Emily Blunt in ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and enjoyed it from the first moment.  This is not a chick flick, in fact it can be called an anti-high fashion cosmo girl flick.  It's starts off with a great song by KT Tunstall (that's actually about the music biz but fits the concept of this movie) over the main titles as you see all the girls getting ready.  Anne Hathaway pays the ""smart fat girl"" (yes, she's a size 6, oh my!) working for the fashion magazine where size 0 is considered too large.  Meryl Strep steals the show with her dead pan head honcho in this comedy (Yes, it's a comedy).  In one scene she has no make up at all!!!  My only negative comment is I found Hathaway's on screen boy friend annoying and incincere.  Anyone lucky enough to bed Hathaway can fake sincerity and supportiveness.  This is a totally enjoyable movie for any one of any sex.  Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci (the TV guy from the Hunger Games) and great add-ons and there is even Simon Baker from The Mentalist in this film!",1406937600,,1069,4.353535353535354

1558311,5,B00005JP0C,"'The Devil Wears Prada' is one of the very few cases where I feel the film actually improves upon the book.  While the book paints Miranda Priestly as a one-dimensional boss from hell, the film shows a deeper side to Miranda Priestly.  Meryl Streep portrays her as a strong female, while she is the ""devil"" she also has layers to her and has moments where you can't help but admire her as a powerful woman.  The character of Andy is another character who in the book is very unsympathetic, whereas in the film you truly root for her and want her to succeed in a world she is unfamiliar with.
Aside from the brilliant casting of Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, the supporting players are all spot on.  Emily Blunt is perfection and can Stanley Tucci do any wrong?
While some write this film off as merely a ""chick-flick,"" it's actually a smart comedy that many can relate to in the working world.  We all have or at one time had a ""boss from hell.""

I also love her attitude transformation, even though it is unsavory. It just shows how corrupt people can get, when image & material things take over. I was pleased to see that she seemed to find a great balance between what she learned at Runway Magazine.  I also love the appreciation to fashion & details of fashion, conversely. I loved the passion that was shown in how people perceive the industry (ex.  when Miranda points out the evolution of Andi's Cerulean Blue Sweater.) This movie is a must-have for any fashionista! The couture influence alone is enough to purchase the movie. I also loved that they minimized the story between Anne Hathaway & Adrian Grenier's characters. It was just enough to know she was in a relationship and how her ""changes"" were affecting it, without it being all about 'the love story'.  It was a perfect blend of comedy, lessons & fashion!

I'm always a fan of character growth and transition and Anne Hathaway pulled that off perfectly and I couldn't have been happier for her character in the end...and yes, I enjoyed the trip to that destination.  I also really enjoyed Stanley Tucci, who found that excellent balance between being a nice and decent person and someone who's been influenced by the fashion world a little too much...his snide remarks towards our heroine were all just right.  In reality, I think the only reason I didn't give this film five stars was because I wanted to see if Miranda Priestly would take the time to call me to demand an explaination for my low rating.

Movies and music can also be designed well and thats what I got from this great flick. I think some of it has to do with the jobs I've had throughout my life, having to make big choices between friends and family and your vocation can be wonderful or devistating. I like to think I've made the right choices because I could have been much more well off than I am if I had chosen the dark side a few times but instead I live a simpler life with low stress and more peace, kinda like Anne.",1388016000,,663,3.955223880597015

She owns the role of the supposed Anna Wintour (who wore Prada when she and her daughter went to this move) and plays her as a cold, perfectionist witch. Hathaway goes from gawky to glam in a New York overnight after being eviscerated by Wintour aka Miranda Priestly.

Emily Blunt and Stan Tucci round out the brilliant acting ensemble, with Emily playing the unfortunate former assistant to Anna/Miranda and Stan playing the wise art director and fashion coach to Hathaway's character, Andy. I can watch this movie every year. If you think it would be fun to work in the fashion industry, this may make you change your mind.

I usually like a book better than the movie that brings it to life but, in this instance, this movie has the advantage of showing us all of that fabulous fashion and the glamorous backdrop of the fashion world.",1378512000,,1001,4.649717514124294

A young woud be journalist needs to support herself, and she interviews as Miranda's second assistant. Her honesty, intelligence and lack of fashion knowledge give her the edge and he lands the job. She doesn't understand he job, until Nigel, played by Stanley Tuci, as the magazine's fashion director explains it in terms Andrea understands. She changes her style and hair and becomes the job and the assistant Miranda wants. Unfortunately it changes her relationships, and life becomes difficult.

We all had dreams as a child, I wanted to be a 'secret spy', I still read all the spy mysteries and thrillers, and had a great career, buti did not follow my dream, obstacles occurred, as they often do. Andrea realizes her dream for awhile, and then it comes undone. But life moves on and so does Andrea. Miranda remains the same, alas.

1559313,4,B00005JP0C,"I am really going to put a different spin on this movie than previous reviewers did.

I've been in situations where I needed a job, finally landed something that was less-than-ideal, and had to rise to the challenge. As I see it, that's what the main character did, and brilliantly. I don't get that she was in love with fashion, just that she got her act together, trimmed her hair, and showed up dressed appropriately for the position. As for the boss, she demanded excellence from herself, therefore demanded excellence from her employees.

I've had bosses who were true devils, who didn't actually set a good example, one who never bathed or wore clean clothes and screamed at me for mistakes I didn't even make and sexually harassed me, and one who demanded a meeting wherein he repeated himself over and over again, trying to get me to agree with him about one point, hoping to wear me down uhtil I caved. And that's just two examples. The boss in this movie is a superachiever who sets a sterling example, wants what she wants and is precise. Oh well, we're not at work to paint each other's toenails, right? She da boss. Life in the big city.

As far as the ethics question, if your job is on the line and your boss tells you to do something or else you will lose your job, well, that doesn't leave much of a choice, correct? I mean, eventually, I left all my jobs from hell, but in the meantime, I had to suck it up so I wouldn't end up unemployed. I think her friends could have been less judgemental, because the job at the fashion magazine did eventually lead to the job she really wanted; she was just paying her dues in the meantime, like we all do -- and paying the rent.

It's an unfortunate reality that there are a lot of bosses from hell (God knows I've had my share). It would be great if we could all take the high road, leave the difficult job, and land the dream job 5 minutes later, like in the movies. But that's why we watch movies, right? For that glimpse of hope that maybe we'll get the dream job soon.

I liked this movie because the main character rose to the challenge, and surpassed it; that was cool to watch. She certainly was less frumpy at the end of the movie; she had found her style, somewhere between casual and over-the-top glam. Even tho I'm not a fashionista, the clothes were fun to watch, and NY is always good to see.",1377907200,5,2364,4.351473922902494

Co-assistant Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) to her fashion magazine boss Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)  :  ""I didn't have a choice.""

Miranda's response: ""Oh, no, you chose.  You chose to get ahead.  You want this life, these choices are necessary.""

The above dialogue is found near the end of this engrossing comedy-drama movie based loosely on Lauren Weisberger's novel ""The Devil Wears Prada"" (2003).  (""Prada"" is an Italian fashion label.)

This movie is the story of a young woman (Hathaway) who wants to fit into a fashion organization, does eventually fit in, and then realizes that she is giving up way too much just to keep fitting in.

Oh, I forgot to mention that this movie is hilarious.  The story revolves around Miranda's assistants (the other more experienced assistant is played by Emily Blunt) trying to please her.  Andrea gets help fitting in and other advice from the magazine's Art Director, Nigel (Stanley Tucci).

Enough has been said about Streep's superb performance.  As the boss, she indeed plays her character as the ""devil in high heels"" with perfection.  Both Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci give stand-out performances as well.

The background music in this film is fantastic.  Also look for several cameos such as the novel's author, Lauren Weisberger, Heidi Klum, and Ivanka Trump.

This movie was filmed both in New York City and Paris.

Having this film set in the fashion world, I felt, was the perfect setting in getting this movie's message across.  Fashion obviously concentrates on the outer person but this movie reminds us that there is an inner person.

As well, this movie asks the subtle question:

""What would you give up and do to get ahead?""

Finally, the DVD (the wide screen edition released in 2006) has several fun and interesting extras.  I personally liked the ""Gag Reel.""

In conclusion, this is a hilarious movie with a subtle message.

""That's all.""

1559492,5,B00005JP0C,"I read the book before I saw the movie, and I think the movie really did it justice. Meryl Streep is absolutely perfect for the role, and Anne Hathaway does a good job with the evolution of her character. And of course, there's Stanley Tucci, whom I adore. Most of the other reviews sum up the movie and characters pretty well, but I will throw my hat in to say, yes, it is definitely worth a watch (even my fiance said it wasn't too bad!)",1375056000,,439,4.176470588235294
1559493,5,B00005JP0C,"This was a excellent movie - there were 3 very good performances -

1. Anne Hathaway as Andrea Sachs - great acting job and great to look at as well! Her Andrea was underplayed but was exactly what the movie needed.

2. Emily Blunt as the 1st assistant, Emily. Her love/hate feelings for Miranda were a highlight of the movie.

3. Stanly Blunt as Nigel - his character was GREATLY changed from the flaming queen of the book. However he makes it work and he's great! His was, once again, a very understated portrayal of a very conflicted person - he loved certain parts of his job but hated what it was doing to his family. BTW - his real life wife died a few years back which was so sad.

And one GREAT performance -

4. Meryl Streep - who managed to infuse her character with hints of some human feeling without over doing it. Quite simply a superb performance from a great actress!!! She's probably the best actress of our time. By just throwing her coat on Emily's desk she recognized Andrea's job performance - and they way she did this very simple thing turned into the start of humanizing Miranda just enough to make you wonder why she was like she was. By the end I felt that Miranda's backstory would be very, very interesting.

The plot was also changed a great deal but all the changes were for the best. The very small alterations in Miranda, Andrea and Nigel were really needed. This was just short of a truly great movie. I'm glad I was talked into seeing this.

The only sour note was the very end when Andy gets back together with her boyfriend just like she was completely unchanged by her experiences. This didn't ring right to me but seems to be the way Hollywood views life in general.

The movie came quickly and was in perfect shape.

Highly recommended - I would rate this a 4.5 to 4.75 out of 5 stars. This was very close to a great, unforgettable movie.",1374451200,,1877,4.370689655172414

1559790,4,B00005JP0C,"When I had cable and flipped channels this was one of those movies that I stopped on, every time. And loved every time! My favorite sequences are Meryl Streep's amazing monologues about fashion and business, anything with Stanley Tucci in it, and Andy Sachs' (Anne Hathaway) makeover. Ooh, and Emily Blunt, who blew up with this movie! I was so pleased to find it at an affordable price and will watch it again and again- aside from a few stutters, it's a great disc and worth having.

That said, this movie is really showing its age.

The book it's based on came out in 2003 and the movie in 2006- both pre-economic crisis. Even the book was a rough go for me, because I found the protagonist a hair irritating. And this is coming from someone who wanted, and still wants, to be a writer. Both book and movie get one crucial detail right: How very hard it is to convince parents and friends that while your pay sucks now, and you're not doing what you want to do at the moment, that paying your dues and getting known is a big part of building that career as a writer.

But frankly I watched this and wasn't rooting for Andy Sachs at all. I was rooting for Miranda Priestly (rumored to be Vogue's Anna Wintour) to break her. Miranda is supposed to come across as acerbic, cruel, and awful (and is all of those things, but less so than in the novel), but really she's just a professional woman who, in order to maintain her status as a fashion-savvy industry powerhouse, needs to be surrounded by willing, capable people who are as engaged as she is. If Weisberger/Andy had just been willing to engage and show some effort, she might have been less frustrated and ultimately left on better terms. As it was, I started reading the book/watching the movie the first time ready to root for Andy, but in the end? Didn't.

Another reason I find this movie/book frustrating is that because these days people take all kinds of ill-fitting jobs just to pay rent, and clearly Weisberger, and her character, did not want this job. And so they shouldn't have taken it. I, personally, would have been one of those millions of girls who would kill for the job of assistant to a major fashion editor. And every time Hathaway rolled her eyes or sighed or there was a speech about being true to one's self, I wanted to throw something breakable.

If she'd wanted to be true to herself, she wouldn't have taken the damn job in the first place. The little scene they wrote for the movie of Miranda and Andy acknowledging each other in a city street was nice. I still can't believe that Miranda would recommend Andy for anything after Andy's behavior, but if she did in real life, Wintour is an even better person than Weisberger deserved her to be, if that makes sense.

That said, I like this movie and I'm happy to have a copy. I will enjoy my favorite scenes, wish I had Emily Blunt's makeup artist (that turquoise eye shadow!) those Chanel boots and access to the schwag closet, and a mentor like Stanley Tucci, but in the end I'm left confused about who to root for.

BTW: If you like Vogue and the references in the movie about the September issue mean something to you, then pick up a copy of RJ Cutler-directed ""The September Issue""- the Sundance doc about Wintour's relationship with her art director as they put together the yearly fashion bible.",1366156800,,3338,4.4983498349834985

1559871,2,B00005JP0C,"The credit sequence for ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a montage of young women putting on designer clothes like they're girding themselves for battle. They are the officemates of heroine Anne Hathaway, who is shown donning a chunky sweater. The motif continues with the young amazons eating elaborately prepared low-cal breakfasts while Hathaway wolfs down a bagel. This sequence is brilliant filmmaking because it establishes in just a few shots without a word of dialog that ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a science fiction film that takes place in a parallel universe in which Anne Hathaway is not a willowy beauty who looks more like a fashion model than anyone else in this movie.

Hathaway plays a just-graduated aspiring journalist who breaks into the magazine world with a thankless job as an assistant to a boss-from-hell editor of a major New York fashion magazine, Meryl Streep, playing a not-even-thinly disguised Anna Wintour. At first Hathaway is hapless and bullied, but she gradually comes into her own in the fashion world, along the way risking the loss of her friends and her integrity. As workplace drama this is enjoyable enough, and Meryl Streep once again proves that she is great in everything, but as visual shorthand for this transformation Hathaway starts the movie as dumpy and gradually transforms into a glamour queen. We know this because of that opening sequence, and because in the first half of the movie Streep and others keep referring to her as ""dumpy"" even though the audience can clearly see that she is stunningly beautiful. Of course it's a convention that female film characters are played by actresses who are too attractive for their roles, but by making beauty a central theme, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level. Hathaway looks like Anne Hathaway. She is more chic than anyone around her. For good measure her boyfriend is played by Adrian Grenier, aka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vincent-Chase/dp/B006GLPA8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vincent Chase</a>.

Had she yelled at any time (as you might find in a real work situation), it would have placed the character over the edge, but she was written and Ms. Streep delivered her impossible demands in such an offhand, almost depressed sort of way, that it really toned the character down alot.  My favorite part of the story was the clothes and the shoes, compared to some of the treatment I've seen in offices (especially when I first started as an office worker), the Anne Hathaway character was treated decently enough - considering the environment she was in (fashion), and her initially poor dress sense, she was treated very well.  Found it unbelievable that any recent college grad would attempt to get a job, without having her hair professionally cut, and without wearing a business suit to an interview - 100% unbelievable; filmmakers wanted to do a before and after, but if the before is not believable, the after doesn't matter.

It shows some aspects of work culture and also the narcissism of success at the same

human at heart as anyone else.

She loses herself along the way, and realizes eventually that she may have traded away more of herself than she bargained for.  Will she abandon her former dreams of journalism?

1560508,5,B00005JP0C,"In viewing this film, The Devil Wears Prada, what could a viewer have in mind?  We are given an answer to this question, ""What is art?"", that differs widely from the one given us by Tolstoy.  In Miranda Priestly, head of a slick, trendy fashion magazine, Runway, we see an autocrat who is a fountainhead of fashion design.  There she is a clarion of style for upscale couturiers for women, and price is not a sole marker of quality.  A viewer can take a lesson that discernment is the crown of learning.

Into this domain arrives a new, second-level executive assistant and receptionist, Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, who aspires to be a journalist.  Her academic credentials are excellent, but her personal style is at odds with ambiance of that office.  Her taste and judgment in attire are casual and undiscerning.  Andy is a healthy, well-formed young woman unconcerned with fashionable strictures  of body line in a world of fashion.  As a prospective new hire, only her chances are slender.  Despite Andy's laughably failed interview, Miranda abruptly reconsiders, and her first assistant, Emily, calls Andy back from the street.  Andy starts in her dream job.  The drama takes a serious turn.

Andy launches into trying tasks as a new hire in a world of high fashion under the whiplash of impatient but discerning Miranda, whose stick is instant dismissal and whose only reward is continued employment in a prestige publication.  And she is sarcastic and unrelenting.  Miranda is a master of innuendo.  In a meeting with her subordinates to plan a new issue of Runway, she says to a good idea from Nigel, ""Thank God, somebody came to work this morning!""

Andrea Sachs, the aspiring journalist, becomes Handy Andy, the duty gopher.  How is she to know when she is doing the right thing?  In desperation, she turns to Nigel, a grudging mentor who gives guidance for her to blossom as a woman of style like others in her company.  Her concern for the feelings of other persons emerges in her work, but relations with her personal friends outside the job suffer.

In the complex plot of this film, a trip to Paris opens a larger world of fashion and the power brokers in it.  A viewer of this film must be attentive to catch the many nuances of intrigue.  A sportive world is revealed as a surreal interplay of personalities.  See this film to catch this drama of scenes behind the scene.  Subtle surprises make a memorable story.",1349136000,,2424,4.752997601918465

  You must view it from more than one perspective..First it is about how you friends can get downright nasty and jealous when you succeed. It is about growing up and pursuing a career path.. I was SO disappointed when Andrea quit her career with Runway... she should have went all the way!!! That Bitch boyfriend left her anyway..her other friends where happy to receive expensive gifts BUT should have backed her up..They just put her down..
After all that was said an done she is on her own ...Life gives you a chance ..TAKE IT... the American culture does not care about newspapers and journalists..

I LOVED the beautiful women and how they got dressed in the opening scenes..NICE legs and Great Louboutin heels!!  walking down the street... It is just worth it to buy it for how the women dress up!!!When Andrea got the Jimmy Choo shoes..I had to find that particular style..got it and love them...

I knew at the beginning that the very moral Andrea would be tempted to betray her friends for power and privilege, but in the end she would realize the error of her ways.  Streep's character was too unbelievably ""evil"".  With many comedies you are convinced to suspend your sense of the ridiculous if the movie is done well enough.  This never happened for me in this movie.  Perhaps some of my disdain has to do with the fact that I have no interest in, or tolerance for the high fashion industry.

Chick just graduates from college, and is searching for a job in NYC. For some strange reason she is offered a post as a secretary in a fashion magazine, even though she wants to be a journalist at anything else but a fashion magazine. So, apparently, she cannot get a job that she wants, but thinks this one might be the job before the job she wants, though how anyone can believe that a secretary job in a field she dislikes can get her a writing job in a field she wants is beyond me.
Secondly, the entire theme of the move is ""Go try and be successful but if trying to be a better person changes you then you should be ashamed of yourself."" It preaches that to be successful, you have to sacrifice everything good in your life, and that people that are successful are unhappy and lonely.
So, every beautiful dress and handbag, every beautiful blouse and shoe, created by hours of work by successful fashion designers in that movie has now been washed in the pond scum puddle of anti-successful feelings.",1344729600,3,1125,4.492682926829269

1560573,5,B00005JP0C,"Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.

Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.

Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.

Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview. No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.

Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.

This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.",1340236800,,3436,5.031634446397188

1560646,5,B00005JP0C,"As an avid reader it is very rare that I enjoy a movie more than I do the book, but with The Devil Wears Prada it wasn't even close. The movie took the book and the characters to a whole other level---and I enjoyed every moment of it.

We get to see Andrea in the beginning going for a job interview at a magazine, just trying to get her foot in the door. At the time she has no idea what Runway is and what it means to others, but when she meets Emily and then Miranda, she sees that for some fashion is not just something to wear. It is a lifestyle.

We then get to watch the evolution in Andrea's personal and professional lives, and at that point we can see not just the effect of Miranda on her but Emily opening herself up to what is possible for her.

The Devil Wears Prada is not as much about Miranda as it is about the choices we make about the life we live. In fact Miranda share that lesson with Emily in one of the most powerful conversations in the whole movie. ""Everybody wants to be us,"" she said. Everyone wants to be admired, respected and recognized for what they bring to the world. In that moment, Emily realizes that the confidence she has gotten from working at Runway can be hers no matter where she is.

This is a movie that will entertain you, make you laugh and also make you think. It also shows that sometimes lessons can come from the most unlikely of sources.",1336435200,,1390,4.156133828996283

 Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is on a job interview to be an assistant for Runway Magazine in New York. She must survive in the business and according to the very stressed out First Assistant, Emily (Emily Blunt), who has an I-Can-Care-Less attitude, she was the Second Assistant until the other woman got a promotion. Now Emily is the First Assistant.
  The CEO, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), is about to enter the building. Everyone jumps to attention like a bunch of busy ants. Within seconds, the office is tidied up, papers and files in place, Miranda's drink is ready and everyone stands in their position. Andrea just stands there in awe of what is going on around her.
 Miranda enters the elevator. No one else is allowed in the elevator when Miranda arrives. Miranda rides it alone up to her floor.
  Miranda is interviewing Andrea only asking 4 questions of her then presumes Andrea does not have any style or sense of fashion. Feeling like she is getting the brush-off, Andrea continues to be nice and says something more factual about herself and her intentions at Runaway. She is suddenly interrupted by Nigel (Stanley Tucci) and is ignored. Andrea says ""thank you"" and walks away. As she leaves, Nigel calls her ""a sad little person"".
  She makes it to the lobby. Emily calls out to her and motions that she is hired, but rolls her eyes at Andrea like, ""why was she hired"".
  Well, what kind of work experience is this going to be for Andrea?

Besides the paltry lesson of staying true to yourself and the friends you had before climbing the ladder to success, about th only major point hit home by the filmmakers is that those glossy fashion mags give hope to those sad boys who'd rather be sewing than palling around with the other fellows who like sports.

Her understated, low key, malicious manipulation of others is a refreshing contrast to the other type of evil behavior that we are accustomed to (blustering, shouting, blatant and violent). The climate of fear that she is surrounded by is, to a large extent, due to her associates' fear of her; that kind of fear is contagious.

Anne Hathaway does a good job of being a doe-eyed innocent who, in order to gain some temporary experience for her resume, tries to get employed by Miranda and, contrary to everyone's expectations, is hired by her. Soon, she learns that working for Miranda is like being put on the rack and slowly begins to sell her soul bit by bit, seduced by all the glamour and her desire not to fail.

The only drawback to the film was Hathaway's boyfriend in the movie; the guy is ugly, ugly, ugly. Couldn't they have chosen someone else?",1314576000,,943,4.674698795180723

Following Ann Hathaway's character, Andy, who is an aspiring journalist, with minimal fashion sense, who joins a fashion magazine as the PA to the ogre of a boss (played by Meryl Streep) this film is quickly set up for plenty of laughs and over the top fashion flamboyance. I've found Hathaway quite annoying in past films but she is actually very good in this film and plays her part very well. Streep's other PA is also hilarious with her back biting and sniping. Andy is asked to perform various outrageous tasks for her demanding boss and soon struggles to juggle home and work life and this leads to the crux of the film. How will she resolve her dilemma whilst maintaining her integrity? This film has some good laughs and cutting sarcastic wit from Streep and is good for a couple of hours viewing. It is easy going, not too heavy and great for a lazy afternoon. It may be pretty innocuous but it never tried to be too high brow or anything other than what it is, simple chick flick fun.

The Devil Wears Prada is about an aspiring journalist, Anne Hathaway, who gets a job as the second assistant to a ruthless fashion magazine editor, Meryl Streep.

At first, Hathaway's, Andy Sachs, thinks the fashion business is a joke and only stays on board to pay the rent until she can get a real job for a newspaper.

After days of ruthless, stinging barbs about her weight and sense of style, Sachs decides to join the team and begins wearing the latest trends.

As she gets deeper and deeper into the business, her relationships with her friends begin to suffer.

Things come to a head when Sachs is invited to Paris with her boss.

For a girly movie based on a book, this film wasn't too bad. I'm a hesitant fan of Hathaways. I'm not much of a Streep fan (does she have to cry in every movie?) but the music and the style of this film kept it interesting.

1560810,5,B00005JP0C,"Lauren Weisberger used her experience as assistant to ""Vogue"" editor Anna Wintour as background for her novel ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" which I'll admit is unread by me.  My goal in this review is to stay out of the pre-existing discussion regarding the similarities between the real Wintour and the fictional Miranda Priestly.  I'll also admit that my own knowledge and appreciation for ""fashion"" is not much beyond the fact that the pinstripes of the New York Yankees are the Brooks Brothers of sports uniforms.

Anne Hathaway plays Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, an intelligent and eager recent journalism graduate.  Job opportunities, she explains in an early expository scene, are scarce and limited to working for an auto repair magazine or ""Runway,"" a fictional fashion icon modeled after ""Vogue.""  (The film does not explain how, with so few job opportunities available, the disinterested Sachs secures the position she is reminded repeatedly ""a million girls would die for."")

Andy is hired as the second assistant to Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly.  Emily Blunt portrays Emily, Miranda's haughty first assistant. Miranda rules the fashion industry from her perch atop ""Runway.""  The world's top designers alter their entire lines based on a nod of her head.  She lords her power over all of her minions and only allows an intimate select few, such as Stanley Tucci's wonderful Nigel, speak to her with anything other than genuflection.  Streep's characterization is a marvel.  Body language and facial expression convey as much as her economical, chilly words.

Andy initially has no particular regard for fashion or those who govern it, but she needs the job.  I saw the film when it was first released in 2006 and at that time I respected a brief speech Miranda gives Andy regarding the importance of fashion in general, and Miranda's pre-eminent position specifically, but after viewing the film a second time I couldn't help but think ""who CARES if one woman says 'cerulean blue is IN?'""  Trying to get a foothold at ""Runway,"" Andy begs the sympathetic Nigel to impart on her a modicum of style, and some of the best scenes in the film show Andy's transformation from ""college drab"" to fashionable attention-getter.  (Although Andy is a ""fat"" size 6 - ""the new 14"", Nigel tells her.) This threatens Emily's position as first assistant, but gathers a few glances of approval from Miranda.

Pre-Entourage Adrian Grenier portrays Andy's chef-boyfriend Nate and Tracie Thoms plays best friend Lily.  The central conflict of the film comes in Andy's mental and emotional transformation.  She is willing to wear the clothes and pretend to be one of Miranda's fawning sycophants, but the actual demands of the job begin to make Andy someone indistinguishable from Runway's shallow fashionistas to her truest friends.  Pre-Mentalist Simon Baker (the casting director for ""Devil"" gets kudos!) plays Christian Thomson, a hot New York writer who takes a fancy to Andy, further complicating her busy life.

How much is Andy willing to turn her back on her friends to ride Runway's gravy train to her desired job as a New York Writer?  Weisberger's book was placed in the chick-lit genre, which I suppose makes this film a chick flick, but unlike a few in that film genre (Sex and the City comes to mind - how can the central male character in this series be known only as ""Mr. Big""?) this movie is not totally dismissive of males and their perspective.",1288224000,,3444,5.007017543859649

1560894,3,B00005JP0C,"Well, I'm all over the map about this movie, I really am, finding something to agree with in almost every review here, including the least positive.

The positives are these: I adore the look and pace of the film, the to-die-for clothes of course, and the performances (first and foremost) of the great Meryl Streep as the towering, terrifying Miranda, the winning Anne Hathaway as the perpetually harassed Andrea, the dependable Stanley Tucci as Miranda's long-suffering, witty-wise second-in-command Nigel, and the wonderful Emily Blunt as the bitchy, put-upon first assistant...uh, Emily. All of them--especially Streep, Tucci and Blunt--bring both bite and (mostly hidden) heart to what could have been a collective phone-in of annoying caricatures. And though we really only get glimpses of him here and there, I also enjoyed Rich Sommers's endearing turn as Doug, the sweetest of Andy's circle.

I am seriously ambivalent however, about what the message of this movie is supposed to be, especially to women, and the alarm bells really go off when--SPOILER ALERT--Andy reconciles with her boyfriend, Nate, telling him he was ""right about everything.""

What? What exactly was he so ""right"" about??

I don't know about you, but I found Nate, the boyfriend character, absolutely insufferable through almost the whole of the movie. I'm pretty sure he was supposed to be the voice of reason that tries hard to keep Andy grounded and remind her what's truly important. Instead he came off as a sulky brat who could not accept his girlfriend's growing pains as she struggled to cope with an impossibly demanding, first ever grown-up job that nothing in her easy-going schoolgirl existence had prepared her for. Were there no demands being placed on Nate in HIS choice of career? Was his job supposed to be the more important one?

Ditto Andy's best friend, Lily, who seemed to me increasingly more jealous of Andy rather than supportive of her. Lily too was pursuing Bright Lights-Big City dreams that demanded a lot from a young newcomer, after all, so how is it that she had such a hard time with Andrea's chaotic ups and downs? Where did Lily get off being so judgmental and disapproving? This is friendship? I watch these performances and can't decide whether actors Adrian Grenier and Tracie Thoms made poor choices in their playing of difficult characters or if the characters as written were simply impossible to like. Either way, both were a whiny pain in the rear, especially Nate, and Andy's mea culpas to him near the film's conclusion were tough to take.

No one disputes that Miranda Priestley was a Boss From Hell who routinely wiped her feet on her young assistants, particularly Andrea. But we also see that ultimately Miranda was as human as anyone else; a glamorous workhorse whose alley-fighter smarts hid real pain. And it should be said that Andy--who was in the beginning quite smug in her disdain of all the fashionista ""shallowness"" that surrounded her--had a knocking down or two coming. (I loved the way Nigel simultaneously comforted Andy and took her to task after an especially bad morning.) If Miranda put Andy through the wringer--and she did--well, she also taught her some important things (sometimes unwittingly) about hard work, hanging tough, and the choices we make in life to get to where we want to go or need to stay. Andy could have quit at the end of her first week (I think I would have) but no matter how bad or insanely silly things got, she didn't, at least not immediately. On some level she became aware that she was getting an education she wouldn't get anywhere else from anyone else, and there was value in that. I think she knew that; I hope she knew that.

In my humble opinion, she is still the best actress of her/my generation and I suspect she will be as luminous at 90 as she is today.  Stanley Tucci is wonderful as well as Streep's always loyal, unsung and ultimately done wrong assistant.  If you've been smart enough to follow Tucci's career, then you'll once again appreciate his amazing range as an actor in this not-so-major movie. Anne Hathaway is fine and, yes, talented but I hope she had the humility to walk around this movie set pinching herself and wondering how she got lucky enough to work with these two actors at this early stage of her career.

She is frequently mocked for being a size 6.  The plot is an obvious jab at the fashion industry.  Streep's character is completely unreasonable as a boss, yet Hathaway bends over backwards to please her (at the expense of her private life).  In real life nobody would take the kind of abuse or demands that are imposed on her.  Streep completely uses and abuses Hathaway to fulfill her own selfish and arrogant persona.  Despite this fact, Hathaway's character actually becomes sympathetic to her boss and seemingly becomes a better person as a result.

1560962,4,B00005JP0C,"Yes, I said it! I hate chick flicks. I usually avoid this sort of movie like the plague. Yet, I'm giving this one four stars. That's because, surprisingly, it ended up being pretty entertaining. You know those movies you can watch over and over and never tire of? This is one of them, I learned, quite by accident. I have now seen it three times - not by choice, mind you. Both subsequent viewings happened aboard a plane, and both times my first thought was, ""Oh great, not THIS movie again..."" But strangely enough, I enjoyed watching it again.

I guess this is in part because I can really identify with the main character - I have had the displeasure of working for a boss from hell in an insane corporate environment, and I too roll my eyes at people who would eagerly sell their soul for designer labels. That said, the plot is a complete unrealistic fantasy. No way would the main character be able to land a job like that, no matter how smart she is, because there're probably 20 girls with ""connections"" who have already been promised the job. Not to mention, prestigious fashion magazine offices usually have very strict dress codes, and she would not be allowed anywhere near one looking the way she did in the beginning of the movie. The film is mostly compellingly watchable thanks to the fantastic performance by Meryl Streep. Can't say I ""get"" Anne Hathaway, but she fit here. I did find her character annoying, and her actions throughout the second half of the film completely implausible. Other than that, this is an enjoyable little ""chick flick"". If you've ever experienced being a corporate slave under the heel of a sadistic boss, you're likely to be entertained by it if nothing else.",1261267200,,1706,4.6490066225165565
1560963,1,B00005JP0C,"I continue to be baffled by the positive attention that this movie has gotten. As a college-aged girl with friends who are all obsessed with this movie, I agreed to see it at some point, and then immediately lost respect for half of my friends.

What is this movie about? An unintelligent, inarticulate, doormat who we're supposed to like for some reason who learns absolutely nothing. She goes to work for some fancy magazine even though she seems totally incompetent, she starts being all shallow, then realizes she shouldn't be shallow. But at least she dropped from a size 6 to a size 4 and kept those cute boots!! Seriously, what is that?

In the end, I have no idea if this movie is trying to justify the existence of the fashion industry or else criticize it. Sure, the main character eventually leaves her job... but her awful experiences and her awful choices (for instance, sleeping with some really greasy dude while she's out of town... this is, apparently, not an issue at all) don't have any real negative ramifications. She gets a great reference or something, moves on, but it's considered a positive step that she is, now, considered conventionally attractive. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE THE WHOLE TIME. Characters consistently make fun of her for being a ""fat"" size 6, and then at the end, with a satisfied smirk, says she's dropped to a size four. And this is the enlightened, I-have-figured-out-my-priorites part of the movie. I have no idea why we're supposed to like the main character. I have no idea why people think that a movie which potrays a protagonist who is so vapid and unlikeable, which views anorexia sympathetically (of all things), which really does seem to value looks over anything else, is a good movie. It's not even funny. There are NO jokes. People talk a lot and then don't say anything. This movie has no depth, no substance, and no message. If anything, it is that being really really good looking really IS important. Even if you're (supposedly) smart and stuff, you could still lose some weight, fatty!

This is one of the few movies that has actually been bad enough to make me angry. Aside from the obvious comment that Meryl Streep's performance was pretty fantastic, this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. There is no reason to watch it.",1260230400,27,2303,4.78140703517588

What caught my attention the most was the struggle that Andy had while deciding if it was worth her keeping a position that she really didn't want but did keep it in hopes that she would eventually get her dream job. She went above and beyond to try to please this woman she worked for.
I was kind of surprised that Andy's boyfriend eventually left her because he could not deal with her being married to her job. I don't think there are many men out there that are happy with an ordinary woman. I haven't come across too many! I thought he would have stayed by her side, understanding all along that she was just trying to reach her own goals.
I know this is Hollywood but in many ways I could relate to Andy and the life decisions she was making, while playing this part, as I too have worked for a few Amanda Priestly's and could have climbed the ladder of success but instead I chose not to live an artificial role...playing a part in life just to have ""a better life"". By the way, I like her last name PRIEST...ly! I took a moment to look up the word ""Prada"" because I really didn't know what it meant or stood for.

Love Anne Hathaway too she is perfect in this part as the oblivious new employee trying to catch a break. Loved Stanley Tucci in his part.

1561031,4,B00005JP0C,"THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a sinfully delicious comedy set in the cut-throat New York fashion industry.  When journalist Andie Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is hired as the new assistant to Runway Magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the stage is set for a a legendary culture (or should that be couture?) clash!  Miranda Priestly--inspired by Anna Wintour, renowned editor of Vogue--is one of the most fascinating characters that Ms Streep has ever played on the screen and she really tries to give some depth to Miranda's life away from the spotlight.

Anne Hathaway, fast becoming the Audrey Hepburn for Gen. Y., has another of her trademark ""ugly duckling to Cinderella"" transformations with her role as Andie.  Stealing every scene is the amazing Emily Blunt, playing Miranda's flinty main assistant; plus Stanley Tucci as one of the catty Runway designers.  A modern classic.

I've compared the Blu-ray disc to the earlier DVD release and the difference is literally night and day.  Extras include audio commentary with the filmmakers and deleted scenes.  This particular BD disc is encoded for playback in regions A through C.",1251072000,3,1135,5.163934426229508
1561032,4,B00005JP0C,Good movie with a excellet quality video. Although I think that should have more subtitle options.,1251072000,,98,5.1875
1561033,2,B00005JP0C,"The outdated premise that creates the conflict of this film (does Andrea sell out?) is that women should sacrifice their ambition and careers for their men--even boyfriends.  It gives us the idiotic ending despite the fact that the film does nothing to support this idea, and as a result, the viewer's sympathies are fixed early on, and solidly with, Andrea, as we're all whisked along in a cinematic cocoon right through the swirl of the action.  Andrea (Anne Hathaway) is an Ugly Betty who very quickly gets a makeover that creates a gorgeous, cosmeticized platform for couture, which she wears well.  She looks like all the other girls in the room, but she has all the lines, so who cares?  Her boyfriend's script allows only for a five O clock shadow, worn t shirts, pants or boxers and shoes.  He's a gourmet commercial cook, and doesn't make a lot of money as we guess from his complaints about the cost of what he buys from Dean and DeLuca.  Boyfriend just doesn't get it, and we quickly lose interest in him, especially since he does so little to support her career.

We're supposed to have more sympathy with the people of her old life, but they're all stick figures, and the movie shows us what Andrea has to go through--she earns every bauble dress she wears.  And then some.  She's not a schemer, she's hardworking, dedicated and principled in a world where the last two are fairly relative, and the hardworking is the minimum expectation.  And then there's Amanda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Meryl Streep fans would be forgiven for thinking this is a Meryl Streep film, it is not.  Meryl Streep doesn't play a character in the traditional sense, she flits in and out of scenes, in her personal hurricane, smacking most everyone she meets and nearly freezing out all the rest.  Think cameos, a string of cameos.  Well before the end of the film, Streep fans are well aware they're not getting enough Streep, at all.  But, since the viewer is so firmly fixed with Andrea, and her world only briefly (and humanely) intersects with that of Amanda, we have no more opportunity to see or know Amanda Priestly.  My, but isn't she fabulously wicked though!

The film climaxes in Paris, and then that ridiculous idea resurfaces in earnest, like a bug that's eating the film, and before you know it, or are ready for it, the film is done, in one of the worst, most inappropriate endings I've seen.  I can't dump on this film as I'd like, because for the most part it's very entertaining.  Even a fashion dolt like me is taken right in, and before long is convinced that with proper couture, we could solve all of the world's problems...Africa!, the Middle East!.  That may well have been the champagne by that point, but the point is, the movie is addictively glamorous, nearly to a fault, and the pace is breathless.  Yet, the way it gives it all up at the end ruins everything.  Watch it with the original ""The Women"" to see how badly dated, yet consistent with the past the idea is.  Ah well.  I wouldn't buy it, but might watch at least parts of it again.",1249689600,8,3060,4.593001841620626
1561034,4,B00005JP0C,"I loved the book and, although the film strays from that by quite a bit to make it simpler to understand, it is nevertheless, still very good.  Unfortunately these story changes make Meryl Streep's character much more pleasant than in the book and this detracts from the impact of the film.

I can help feeling as well that, good as Anne Hathaway was, Emily Blunt would have been far more convincing in the lead part.

All the main actors are excellent and even a jeans and t-shirt male like me who normally despises 'fashion', was caught up with the characters and their hopes and fears.",1249430400,,588,4.580952380952381

1561037,4,B00005JP0C,"This entertaining film adaption of a bad book was a pleasant surprise. Everyone who hasn't been living in a cave in Mongolia for the past several years knows the book was a thinly disguised account of the author's experience as an assistant to Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of ""Vogue,"" the most influential fashion magazine on the planet. I threw the book at the wall after about three pages of poor writing and an insufferable protagonist. In the far better written film, Meryl Streep does a terrific job of making Miranda Priestly, the ice queen editor-in-chief of ""Runway"" magazine, coldly terrifying while allowing just enough of a crack in the veneer to reveal the price she had paid for her power. Stanley Tucci is funny and humane as Miranda's fashion director Nigel. Emily Blunt is also very appealing as the more senior of Miranda's two personal assistants. Although there's dissension on this point, I found Adrien Grenier adorable as main character Andie Sach's boyfriend. The weak link is lead Anne Hathaway as Andie, Miranda's new personal assistant. She's sweet, she's vulnerable, she looks gorgeous in haute couture, but at this stage of her career, she does not have the star power to carry this movie. The plot is predictable and the values are confused (are we indicting or glamorizing the fashion industry? some of both), but you could do worse things with two hours than enjoy this film's talented supporting cast, witty screenplay and visual panache.",1245283200,,1475,5.024489795918368

1561039,3,B00005JP0C,"After several attempts to watch this on cable, I have finally seen it all.  With that being said, you are probably better off attempting to watch it on one of its numerous cable/movie channel runs.

The story is this: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway) comes to NY in hopes of making it big as a serious investigative journalist, but winds up taking a job that she is not suited for, and does not want, working for Miranda Priestly (played splendidly by Meryl Streep).  As Andy comes to realize more and more everyday just how much she does not belong and hates her job, she eventually tries to make the best of it by the old ""grin and bear it"" method.  She does end up doing better, but at the cost of her social life.  And the story winds down the predictable path about the choices that Andy must make in order to be truly happy.

Not the most unique, but I guess it works, although I found the ending trite and borderline insulting to young professional women.

Regardless of that, the film is a wonderful vehicle for the talents of Meryl Streep (of course) and Emily Blunt.  Any one interested in fashion will also be appeased, as it is a fashionista's dream.

It is good for a cute goofy movie, but nothing too funny or endearing to make it worth owning.",1244419200,,1256,4.402597402597403

maybe if you never watch something like this, then you will find the movie very original.  otherwise, i don't see anything special about this movie.

If I had seen the various parts, i would have known what this movie is about, and will not watch it, knowing that it is the same old same old.

1561103,4,B00005JP0C,"Look, I don't even know what ""prada"" is (nor am I inclined to take the time to find out).  What I do know is I've seen THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA several times, and I find it a clever and engaging comedy for two reasons:  Because Anne Hathaway is so absolutely delightful and because Meryl Streep is so absolutely good.

Playing a New York newbie who's hired to be an assistant to an editor of a chic fashion magazine, Hathaway brings an innocent naivete that is appealing and genuine.  Plus she's easy on the eye; I find her to be one of the most beautiful actresses on the big screen today.  And then there's Meryl Streep as the beastly Miranda Priestly--the boss who won't take ""No"", or ""I can't get that done"" for an answer.  We've all had bosses from hell, but Miranda easily sets the bar as the most self-centered, diabolical, conniving--duplicitous.  And all the while, Streep plays this role in a soft-spoken manner; her Miranda may appear to be in control, but the volcano could erupt at any moment.  And is it ever fun to watch.

Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci, and Simon Baker furnished the main male roles in this film, and none of them (count 'em) were interesting (okay, maybe Tucci's role as a frustrated fashion designer was a tad interesting); this, I think, was intentional.  THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a flick made for chicks.  Speaking of, I enjoyed Emily Blunt as the stressed other assistant willing in an instant to fall on her sword for Miranda; Blunt gets more than her fair share of funny scenes.  But she doesn't tell me what prada is.  But that's okay.

1561104,4,B00005JP0C,"Just picked up a dvd of this movie and it's so much tamer than the book.  What a horrifyingly stupid decision for the writers to make Miranda Priestly a sympathetic character, from boo-hooing about her divorce to privately smiling in fond satisfaction at her protege's progress. . . . after deliberately snubbing Andrea as she got into her car!  I mean, come on.  She never would have felt ANYTHING but annoyed contempt for her assistant; the girl was nothing to her but a slave to bully and denigrate.  A mean person is a mean person is a mean person - - there is nothing amusing, sympathetic, or even particularly human about such virulently nasty people.  I know that because I worked for a toxic boss  over 10 years ago, back in the days before academia would have called someone like on the carpet for her atrociously cruel abuse of the adminstrative staff.  She was a sociopath.  Sure, she was bitter and unhappy, but did we pity her for her misery?  No, everyone despised, feared, and resented her, and most of them toadied to her in terrified genuflecting awe, as if the sun rose and set on that old bat.  And that, my friends, is how Bosses From Hell Get Away With It.

The novel Devil Wears Prada is exactly what that author went through; if it isn't the truth it's pretty close to it - - no one could make such ghastly incidents up.  That roman a clef was written for a reason, but notice how NO ONE in the dvd's bonus featurettes discussed whom the character was REALLY based on, and how all the interviewss breathlessly decreed that they were going to treat the fashion industry with ""respect.""  What, were the New York designers going to hire thugs to go beat up the producers, directors, writers and actors who made this movie?  Threaten to have their careers ruined?  Make sure that they ""never ate lunch in this town again""?  What in blue blazes was everyone so AFRAID of?  During the filmed interviews of the people who made this movie, they all but looked over their shoulders while they talked, the whites of their eyes showing in terror.

That said, this was an absolutely scrumptuous movie to watch as far as clothes, scenery, snide confrontations. . . . but if only the character of Andrea had fought back more or somehow retaliated, instead of being so nicey-nice to all those vicious clacking fashionistas who snubbed, berated, and insulted her. That tray of dishes hurled into the sink - Miranda's suddenly unwanted lunch - - should have been hurled at her over-coiffed head.",1238371200,,2501,4.619909502262443

1561106,4,B00005JP0C,"This movie works because the three central chracters (Andrea Sachs, Miranda Priestly, and Emily) are so interesting. This movie does not work as well as it should because it focuses too much of its time on the relatively banal peripheral (Andrea's boyfriend, friends, and father etc) characters.

That is really too bad because I found Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) to be one of the most fascinating characters I have seen in the movies in a long time. At the end of the movie, the viewer is left wanting to know more of her. Yet we know so little of her except her superficial outerself which so obviously belies something far more complex.

The central character, Andrea Sachs, is played by ever so likeable Anne Hathaway. When Anne Hatahaway plays a character, it is very hard to dislike that character. That ability is a major plus in a starlet, but it also limits her ability to play different and more complex roles.

Emily Blunt (who plays Emily) is, as Meryl Streep describes her, one of the best, if not the best, young actresses today. She successfully makes her limited role into a colorful and memorable character.

At the end of the movie, you will feel entertained and glad to know the glimpses of the 3 main characters. But you will also wish you had known more of them.",1234051200,4,1287,4.656387665198238
1561107,5,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a staple in my personal movie library. Rarely has a lioness been more enticing or vicious in corporate America as Meryl Streep's ""Miranda Priestley.""  Priestley is equal to task to Michael Douglas' ""Gordon Gekko"" in the movie ""Wall Street."" But, why do we love these characters that would do anything to achieve and maintain professional success?  I believe ""...Prada"" is a microcosm of the world.  Most people are afraid to wholeheartedly go after the ""Brass Ring.""  When we see the likes of a Miranda Priestley (Streep) entering onto the world stage, we love and loathe her simultaneously for her viciousness as well as her victories.  While she may exhibit somewhat psychopathic tendencies, she is not the shrinking violet many would have her be.  In fact, her subordinates become victims of the ""Stockholm Syndrome."" While the fashion industry isn't a philanthropic endeavor, the characters become sucked into her vortex, enamored by the passion and sheer excellence Miranda puts into her vocation.  Meryl Streep was edged out by Helen Mirren's ""The Queen"" for the Oscar, but it's Streep's riveting performance that keeps me repeating the experience.

Watch ""The Devil Wears Prada"" to be entertained and educated about the ways of the world. The most salient one liner in the movie was Streep's divulging a truism of contemporary society and its pursuit of acclaim, fame and fortune, ""Everyone wants to be us.""

1561178,2,B00005JP0C,"I didn't love the book, but this movie barely even resembles it. As someone who just finished the book a couple weeks ago, it was impossible for me to watch the movie without constantly noticing things that were shockingly different. With the exception of Andrea herself, every single character in the movie was either changed completely or simply left out. Miranda's more sympathetic, Emily's less sympathetic, Lily has her life under control, and the security guy who makes Andrea sing doesn't exist. Andrea doesn't buy Starbucks for homeless people or smoke cigarettes whenever she gets a chance. Even her boyfriend has a different name and career. Andrea's life seems a lot more pleasant here.

Meryl Streep is very good in this, but I wished she acted more the way she did in the book and not as the kinder, gentler, and ultimately more sympathetic version of Miranda that's in the movie. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" hardly even seems like a fitting name for this since Miranda doesn't seem all that bad. Yes, she asks her assistants to do a lot of things all at once, including some things that are ridiculous, but that's a typical executive assistant job.

1561266,4,B00005JP0C,"We all know the boss.  The man/woman who knows it all and tramples on everyone.  I've worked for her; you probably have too.
""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the ""simple"" story of a young college graduate, Andy (Anne Hathaway), trying to find a job.  She looks at a fashion magazine, Runway, whose editor-in-chief, Miranda (Meryl Streep), is so harsh that girls who last one year as her assistant are granted ""any job they set their heart on"".  The problem?  Andy is so not into fashion, it's not funny.  And Miranda is, well...""difficult"".
I was unsure if I would actually enjoy the film.  I had heard mixed reviews.  But after finally seeing it for myself, I realized that on the whole, I enjoyed it.  Anne Hathaway has the ""My Fair Lady"" role down-pat.  Emily Blunt is very appealing as Emily, the desperate assistant.  Even the actor who plays Nigel is charming.  But Meryl Streep as Miranda is the star of the show.  She steals the screen every time she appears, with enormous presence, a cool gaze, and her quiet, demanding voice.
The other characters are weak.  We as the audience are supposed to be rooting for Andy to spend more time with her friends, but when her boyfriend, Nate, acts like a baby when she has to work on his birthday, you can't help but dislike them (I mean, come on, how many adults REALLY celebrate their birthday on their actual birth date?).  When Nate says it would be better for her to be a pole stripper with integrity (what the...?!) than what she is, you want to kick him where the sun don't shine.
The plot is not complicated, well done, but the big ""turning points"" can be seen a mile away (such as Andy's conversion to fashion, her being chosen to go to Paris, and her eventual quitting).  The clothes are beautiful (well, some of them are odd, but that's coming from a Wal-Mart girl :) ), the pacing perfect, and the scenery (particularly Paris) beautiful.  There is some foul language, a scene where a woman gets hit by a car, some allusions to eating disorders, the overall impression that clothes size does matter (Andy ends the film as a ""satisfied"" size 4 after being a ""fat"" size 6) and some sexual situations, but nothing particularly glaring.
Overall, I liked the film.  It is a great story of a young woman trying to justify her job with her morals.  While I did not like how her friends (particularly her boyfriend) did not understand that sometimes you have to do things you don't like (aka your job) to pay the rent (and get the expensive purses that your friend rather enjoys) and that fun things will have to come later, it is a really good movie that showcases Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway's talents.

NOTE (Sep. 10, 2009): Another irk I had with the movie was the terrible job interviews.  No one with half a brain will go into a job interview and admit that the only reason they are there is because it was their last resort.  I can pretty much tell you they will be leaving unemployed.  Secondly, people who are interviewing for jobs ought to check out the place they are interviewing.  That is just basic interviewing common sense.  Lastly, using slang like ""screwing up"" and admitting you made mistakes is, contrary to what the film shows, not going to endear you to your future employer.  Always use proper formal language and never try to sell yourself short.  You admit failures; you are basically saying that you aren't worth hiring.

The casting for this moving was pretty right on, however the casting for the character Christian seemed way off.  While charming, he was much older and much less attractive than expected - I and found it a little unvbelievable that he would turn Andie's head in any way.  I had actually hoped this character would have a bigger role in the movie based on what I read in the book.  This character could have been removed from the movie and wouldn't have made a different.  Because of the casting, he should have been.

Meryl Streep is fabulous and nails this character perfectly as does Ann Hathaway.  The clothes in the movie are great and it's a great story - just not one of the best movies ever.  I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5.",1216598400,2,954,4.411428571428571

1561269,2,B00005JP0C,"This is the heart-chilling story of an intelligent young woman with a lot of potential--if a somewhat tenuous grasp on her own identity--who, through the course of the movie, has everything that was interesting or endearing stripped from her by an unfortunate expedition into a superfluous industry.

This, in and of itself, would not be so bad except for the fact that the viewer is supposed to feel good for her by the end. This movie would have made a great tragedy.  It could have been a fantastic commentary about how many young college graduates, thrust into the real world without an adequate transition period, become the prey of a business world that eschews substance in favor of form, and are forced to take on scripted roles that crush the individual potential they once had. Instead, this movie celebrates this process, and for that it is saddening.

The script, on top of its depressing advocacy of modern materialism, was banal. From watching to the ten minute mark, just about anyone will be able to predict the denouement. It is utterly uncompelling as a story, and offers no memorable insights. The one mark in its favor is that the acting is good. The two leads do an impressive job with the sub-par material from which they had to work.

Overall, however, the cringe-worthy message and the hackneyed storyline make this a downright bad movie. It was painful to watch, because I liked Hathaway's character at the beginning of the movie, and I was insulted that I was supposed to applaud the descent into shallowness and frivolity and exposed the weakness of her character.",1215216000,5,1591,4.838235294117647

1561272,3,B00005JP0C,"An excellent performance by Meryl Streepe (aka Miranda Priestly/Dragon Lady).  Miranda is somebody really big in the fashion industry.  She is soooo big, that everybody jumps to her every desire, including designers, writers, photographers, etc.  Miranda runs a huge fashion business and fashion magazine based out of New York City.  Miranda keeps 2 personal assistants and has only one (Emily) right now and Miranda is looking for a second assistant.  This is the job that ""a million girls would die for,"" as you will hear said several times.  The ""devil"" wearing Prada does not refer to a Satan figure.  It is just that Miranda is such an unapproachable person, so much so that when she comes in to work, everybody else quickly walks the other way and the workers all go into complete panic.

Enters Anne Hathaway, as Andria, a simple girl with a degree in journalism.  Andria is immediately snubbed by Emily and Miranda as having no fashion sense and totally wrong for the job, but Miranda decides to hire Andria anyway, against her better judgement.  Miranda is truly the boss from hell.  Working for her is faster paced than Superman can fly.  She is abrupt, demanding, cold, and volitile.  You are also on call 24/7 and the pay is not that great.  Andria is trying her best but getting frustrated fast when finally she decided to get with the program.  Seeking the assistance of male co-worker and fashion coordinator for Miranda, Nigel, Andria sheds her dumpy sweaters and black school-girl tights and starts dressing in the high-fashion style from the company's supply.  This begins to please Dragon Lady and Andria/Andy begins to acquire bigger and better job responsibilities.  Andy also begins to take on the all-for-business personality more in-keeping with her new line of dress.  Her friends and boyfriend don't really like the changes either.

The movie is about the big business of the high fashion industry, even taking you to Paris designer shows.  It's about intense career committment that is above a personal life.  It's also about change, what's important, wheeling and dealing in the corporate world, disappointments, and caring or not caring about people. The ""Devil Wears Prada"" could also be a comparison to the concept of giving your personal life over to the corporate world.

I guess you would call this a chick-flick.  I don't see where most guys would be interested in it.",1212537600,3,2403,4.967418546365915
1561273,5,B00005JP0C,"When this film came out and the buzz began about Streep's Oscar worthy performance, I didn't find the time to see it.  Now that it's on DVD, I am eating it up like a Junior's Cheesecake (New Yorkers will know what I mean).  Here is why I LOVE LOVE LOVE this film:  I had a boss like Miranda Priestly once.  The first day she placed her dirty lunch tray on my ""out"" box I knew the job was not going to be good on my psyche.  In fact, much like Andy as the aspiring writer, I wrote my first college A+ essay on the trials of being someone's assistant thanks to the material my former boss gave me.  In comparison, at least Andy's job had the perks of the fashion industry like shoes, clothes and accessories; mine just had the late nights and lowly paycheck.

Nevertheless, back to my review.  Streep is on point as the ""Dragon Lady"" Miranda, editor in chief of RUNWAY magazine (the equivalent of VOGUE).  Her subtle glances of disapproval, slight snicker and tilt of the head, all speak volumes while hapless assistant, Andy, is trying her best to get the job done.  Having no background in the fashion industry or its demands, she stumbles along trying to win over the respect or at least appreciation of her coworkers and superiors, all of whom seem to take pleasure in humiliating her in every area from her onion breath to the way she clops around in what looks like a pair of clumsy Payless loafers.

The sheer materialism is no joke, this is really how it is in MANY corporate offices, not just in fashion, but also in the beauty industry, advertising and the list goes on.  Give the wrong person a title and it will go to his or her head, making them behave as if somehow they are ""above"" the rest of us, they are irreplaceable, and maybe even immortal.

The supporting characters are strong, especially Stanley Tucci as the senior designer who bascially takes Andy under his wing to transform her into a work of art, fashionably speaking.  His wit and sarcasm are perfect, and again, I worked with people like him so I totally related to his character.  The plot was predictable, and of course you get the sense that Andy will eventually disappoint her friends by choosing work over partying, but that in the end her conscience will take over and .... well, I don't want to be a spoiler here.  Enjoy this for what it's worth, not for anything earth shattering or new, but for a sometimes comical, always sarcastic look at life in the world of high fashion.  Plus, the on location filming in New York City is awesome, as is the soundtrack, chock full of hits from Madonna to U2 and Alanis Morissette.",1211068800,2,2606,4.4641350210970465

1561327,5,B00005JP0C,"Far more than just a humorous take on the fashion industry, a mere 40 minutes into the story, we begin developing deep connections and storylines.  Amidst the office humor, we are introduced to the complexity of balancing career aspirations, intimate relationships and personal development.  Pretty heavy stuff for what I presumed was a light breezy film.

The story follows Andrea (known to friends as ""Andy"" - and played by Anne Hathaway) after she accepts a job as 2nd assistant to the ""Devil"" Miranda - played flawlessly by Meryl Streep.  Think of Miranda as a real life Leona Helmsley, someone I personally admired.  A woman with passion for excellence and a sharp (often misconstrued as b*itchy) attitude.  Andrea develops in her new career, and agrees to ""serve"" one year, if she can ""s*ck it up"".  Her career attitude affects her personal one, and her long-term relationship with her boyfriend and close circle of friends suffers.  In the meantime, her career advances, and she is also pursued by a man of the business, who wants more than just her business assets.

As the film draws to an end, Andrea realizes the person she ""truly"" is, and makes decisions that will affect her career, and her relationships.  Some of which comes too late.

While this review makes the movie out to be more of a drama than a comedy, there are ample laughs throughout the film.  But unlike strict comedy's, this one has several serious moments, especially in the second half.  Well worth viewing.  Great on a cold winter night, or rainy summer evening.  Or just anytime you need something on the light side with an ample amount of drama spliced in.

This was a solid 4, but I gave it a 5, because I would watch it again (and I rarely watch movies twice).  I found the deeper side of the story made this film rare in it's category.  Without it, it would have been ""just another"" 3-star film (maybe 4).",1205107200,6,1892,4.699088145896656

1561330,4,B00005JP0C,"Andrea Sachs is fresh out of college and turns down Stanford Law for a career as a writer.  She's bright, perky, talented and motivated, but the only writing job she can find is second assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of Runway Magazine.  A million girls would kill for her job, everyone tells Andy. Andy couldn't care less about fashion, she thinks it's all nonsense, but she only plans to stay there for a year anyway.  A year working for Miranda Priestly will get her a job in any other magazine she wants.

It's easy to see why.  Miranda Priestly, whose character may or may not have been based on the real-life editor-in-chief of Vogue, is an evil boss-from-hell who revels in pure sadism.  Between throwing her coat and purse in Andy's face every morning, belittling her lack of fashion sense, sending her on impossible errands and generally keeping her at her beck and call twenty-four hours a day, Andy's personal life and her relationship with her live-in boyfriend are both on the skids.  But just when she's about to toss in the towel, Miranda's second-in-command Nigel takes her in hand and oversees her personal makeover, and she pulls off an impossible task Miranda has set for her, earning Miranda's approval on both points.  The ugly duckling turns into a trendy swan.

But at a considerable cost.  As Nigel tells her, you know you're doing well at work when your personal life goes down the toilet.  ""I didn't have any choice,"" Andy wails when her soon-to-be-ex-live-in-boyfriend accuses her of choosing Miranda over him, and when she pulls off a coup that makes Miranda decide to take her to the annual fashion show in Paris instead of the first assistant, who had been starving herself for weeks in anticipation of the event.  Only when Miranda tells her she sees a lot of herself in Andy, does Andy realize to her horror that if she stays in this job she's liable to turn into a mini-Miranda.  Is it worth it, trips to Paris and all?  That's the choice she has to make.

The cast in this film is generally very good indeed.  Anne Hathaway makes a winning Miranda, all big eyes and fresh-faced naivete.  Stanley Tucci is excellent as Nigel, Miranda's second, who's sacrificed his personal life for the magazine he loves.  And Emily Blunt does a very good acting job as Miranda's first assistant who finds herself outdone and out-gunned, however unwillingly, by Andy herself.  But this movie belongs to Meryl Streep, whose usual mousy-blond looks were morphed into something drop-dead gorgeous, with silver-white hair that symbolizes her icy personality that nothing can thaw; one look from this woman could literally freeze hell over.  If Miranda has a weak side to her, she'll never show it.  She's harder than a block of cement and that's the reason for both her successes and her failures.  The movie isn't very profound on any level, but the message comes across: make your work your priority at the expense of your family and friends and you'll end up rich, powerful and alone.  But like any well-presented message, director David Frankel manages not to make it too obtrusive so as to spoil the fun, and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is ultimately a fun movie.

However, my incredibly neutral viewpoint quickly disintegrated into genuine enjoyment just a few minutes into the film.  Meryl Streep is as gifted as they come, and sometimes her facial expressions can steal the scene - that is, unless her biting dialogue hasn't already done so.  The fact that Streep's vocal inflection is fairly low key and steady makes the words all the more amusing (of course, they'd be far from amusing if this was your actual boss in real life).  Sure, there are cliches, but virtually every Hollywood movie has them nowadays.

Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep and all the actors/actresses did a great job in this movie.  It starts off with Hathaway looking for a job, and by chance gets a job with Streep.  Streep is the boss from hell, and Hathaway's co-workers are less than hospitable to her when she starts.  Hathaway really struggles in the job when she first starts.  As the movie continues on you will notice how Hathaway changes into a different person.  Her co-workers also change in their attitude toward her.  The ending of the movie shows you she has not changed too much, but I will not give the movie ending away.  To all the men who are thinking about this movie, this is a great movie to see, and it is not too much of a chick flick.

Young, niave and frumpy Andrea (played with wide-eyed charm and subtle wit by Anne Hathaway) gets a job as Miranda Priestly's second assistant for Miranda's fashion magazine Runway, a job which ""millions of girls would kill for."" Andrea, however, has her sights set on being a serious journalist and describes her new job as ""either this or tv guide.""

But in walks...no, struts... diva dragon Miranda Priestly, the mother of all nightmare bosses, tossing out her over the top demands.  Meryl Streep plays...no, inhabits... this role with perfection.  She is cool and powerful, and her wit and comic timing are unmatched.  Her lines and delivery (""tales of your incompetence do not interest me"") are dead-on hilarious.  She has every swish of the hand, every lift of the chin, and every dreaded purse of the lips on spot.  Yet occasionally she displays just a hint of vulnerability which makes her surprisingly empathetic.

Emily Blunt, the overworked and bitingly sarcastic ""first assistant"" and Stanley Tucci are also superb.

Andrea's subsequent struggles, her determination not to fail at this job, her adaptations to the fashion world, and her final choices after she has seen the dark side of high fashion (and, of course, Miranda's responses to all this) make this both a funny and oddly captivating movie.

Be content with smaller things and don't dream big, it's too scary out there."" Either that or ""Don't change who you are inside for the high life, don't betray your friends, it's morally wrong and makes you into a bad person who doesn't like or recognize herself and it's not worth it"".

One of those messages should be listened to by all those silly girls desperately wearing the aggressively trashy clothing and excessive bling; the other is a crock of bad beans.

1561386,2,B00005JP0C,"I HATE Meryl Streep with a PASSION, but I received this DVD as a Christmas gift; so I felt obligated to watch this film at least once.
  I think Streep, who never fails to make my skin crawl, is THE WORST actress of all time. She, on the other hand, clearly thinks SHE iS THE BEST-- and she has miraculously managed to convince a lot of other people to believe it as well. Monsterous Meryl, looking like a cross between herself, Cruella De Ville, and Martha Stewart, is perfectly cast to- type as ice- queen fashion editor Miranda Prestley. Miranda expects everyone and everything in life, including hurricane weather, to be at her beck and call. I imagine Meryl expects exactly the same in her real life. Meryl and Miranda would eat Audrey Hepburn for breakfast, but since ""PRADA"" is not a fun ""FUNNY FACE"", Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci get eaten instead. Some vain attempt is made late in the film to show a ""human"" side of Miranda; but fashion folks are depicted as shallow and cut-throat here, and Miranda is no exception. This is the type of role that Meryl can ""phone in"" by now, and that's exactly what she does.
  The surprise is that, if you can get past the endless screams of ""Hail, Meryl""-- the film actually belongs to lovely Anne Hathaway and the supporting cast. Hathaway, Blunt, and Tucci all hold their own on screen opposite Meryl Streep surprisingly well. Hathaway plays Andrea Sachs, who takes a ""temporary"" job as Miranda's second assistant. Not surprisingly, Stanley Tucci gives her a fashion make-over (identical to the one Anne Hathaway received in ""THE PRINCESS DIARIES"") and Andrea quickly turns as shallow as the people she initially despises, and she gets caught up in the surface glamour and glitz of her job at ""Runway Magazine."" Her head is temporarily turned by sexy scoundrel Simon Baker.
 I  kept wishing for her to get her head back on straight and return to her adorably sexy boyfriend, played by Adrian Grenier. I also kept wishing for her to tell Miranda to go to hell and throw coffee in her face. She doesn't. Since Andrea is always fetching coffee for Miranda, I kept wishing she would wake up and smell the Starbucks!!

She turned her back on all that she once believed and became all that she was expected to by the fashion world. She gloats about her losing weight to fit into smaller sizes when she was beautiful the way she was. This sends a horrible message to the young girls of the world. Anne Hathaway in this movie turns from a well educated well grounded woman to a fashion obsessed, weight obsessed, success obsessed woman. She sleeps with a man in a terrible ""one night stand"" and turns her back on her boyfriend and close friends. And for all of this she is taken back in the end.

Not a total bomb of a movie, but not all that great either.",1193529600,,496,4.6022727272727275
1561489,4,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is about a recent Ivy League graduate that can't find a job to pay the bills  while waiting to be a successful writer. She finally lands a job as an assistant to the personal assistant of a top fashion magazine editor.  The only trouble is she never heard of the editor, nor read the magazine, nor has any fashion sense.  Unfortunately, the editor is a self-absorbed, fiercely ambitious woman who barely talks above a whisper, but has an attitude that is as frosty and drop dead cold as her hair.

And yet, this is a fun movie.  Thanks to Meryl Streep who turns simple lines like ""That's all"" and ""Why is nobody ready?"" into comedic classics. She deftly rides the line between nasty and comical.  As the movie develops, Ms. Streep is also able to break from the script's clich of the lonely heart behind the powerful woman.  Meryl Streep even decided to go an extra step and do one of these scenes with no make-up, a rarity in Hollywood movies, to show how tired, worn and, well...normal...her character really is.

So, what's the movie like when Meryl isn't in a scene?  Not as good. Anne Hathaway plays the new assistant, but with not nearly as many shades as Meryl Streep.  After a particularly nasty chewing out by the boss, Ms. Hathaway's character decides to give herself a fashion makeover, take her job seriously and impress the boss.  However, unlike Ms. Streep, Anne Hathaway can not break out of the script's predictability to make it more engaging. Other developments of her character, equally predictable, bring the movie dangerously close to showing its ""chick lit"" roots.  As a repeat viewer of this movie, most of these scenes are frequently skipped.

Other characters are Anne Hathaway's boyfriend, who is a bland sounding board for Anne.  Two others, however, a loyal long suffering employee played by Stanley Tucci and the other assistant, played by Emily Blunt, manage to edge into Meryl's limelight and generate a few laughs and some interest.

But it's Meryl Streep, by flinging her coat or tossing a steak after half a bite, or simply saying ""That wasn't a question"", that generates laughs, amazement and even, once in awhile a ""Gee, I'd like to try working for her.""",1193184000,3,2214,4.7591623036649215
1561490,5,B00005JP0C,"Last night I sat down to watch THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA  with the wife.  I knew it was a chick flick going into it.  So I knew it would be tough to get through.  But give me a break!

About 30 minutes into the movie,  having all the fashion, make-up, clothing, and shoes I could handle,  I got up from the couch,  nodding approvingly and smiling.  It was one of those forced smiles, like when you're out for cocktails, and realize that the sushi you ate an hour ago was rotten and there's about 200 people between you and the nearest bathroom.

Fortunately, I was at home,  and the bathroom was right by the living room.  What! was I going to do to get out of watching this damn movie??

""Think!""  I said to myself.  So I grabbed the curling iron,  plugged it in,  put my head in the toilet,  and dropped the curling iron in it too.

""Ahh,  what sweet relief this would be!""  I thought.

Nothing.  It didn't do anything.  So I towel dried my hair and went back out to the couch.  I suffered through another 15 minutes,  but it seemed like years and years gone from my life.  I got up again and headed to the bathroom.  The electric shaver!  That should do it.  I plugged it in,  turned it on,  zzzzzzzzzzz,  plunged my head into the toilet,  and merrily dropped the shaver in after it.  ZZzzzzzzzzzzzz,  blurp, blurp...................... Again,  nothing.  What the f***?

I ran up the stairs,  grabbed the toaster,  went back down and into the bathroom.

""Are you all right?""  she asked.

""Fine""  I said.

Desperately, I plugged in the toaster,  pulled down the lever, waited til it got nice and red-hot,  dove head first into the toilet,  and  eagerly pulled the toaster into the oven.

ZZZzzzzzttttt.  Zap!  ZZzpppfff.

1561582,4,B00005JP0C,"The Devil Wears Prada has always been a guilty pleasure of mine.  I'm a guy who loves romance, comedies, and other chick flicks; however, my sense of fashion (or even interest in it, for that matter) is lacking, and I don't have a desire to jump into the fashion world.  I suppose Miranda Priestly would completely despise me, but that's not such a bad thing.

The Devil Wears Prada is about Andy Sachs--a recent graduate looking to make something happen for herself in the professional world.  She's interested mostly in journalism, but, unfortunately, she's run into little to no luck landing a job.  This supposed strike against her doesn't appear to be as bad as the one she experiences within the first 15 minutes of the film.  For some strange reason, she applies and interviews for an assistant-to-the-chief-editor position at Runway, the world's premiere magazine in fashion.  The reason this is so strange is that she literally has no sense of fashion whatsoever (an understatement!  Watch the first ten minutes and you'll know what I mean, and I don't even have a sense of fashion!).  Miranda (Chief Editor) takes one look at her and practically judges Andy's entire life based on the sweater and skirt she's wearing.  It's a subtle, tense, and completely hilarious scene all at once, and we see Andy leave in disgust as she's sure she's not gotten the job.

Well, as odd ironic movie fate would have it, Andy lands the job and works as Miranda's second assistant.  The film steadily shows Andy's strong dedication to her job and her ever-increasing fashionable side.  She grows into a character whom she loves and eventually dislikes, leading to more irony and self-realization.

Even though the film does not have incredible character arcs and overwhelming tension, it still remains clever and well-written.  The actors (especially Streep and Blunt) give outstanding performances, and it's through these listed elements that makes this film one to enjoy a few times over.

***Blu-ray***
The Blu-ray disc for The Devil Wears Prada is single layer BD-25, and the picture comes across strong in most scenes.  The city takes are relatively short, so don't expect to be blown away by nighttime New York (there's just not much to oooh aaaww at here), and there's really no special effects because, honestly, this isn't an action film.  But the colors are all natural and breath-taking, keeping the film relateable instead of surreal.  What you see is a drama about fashion and self-realization delicately worked on by hi-def fashion artists.  The film works and so does its picture.  Take it for what it is, and you should be pleased.",1189900800,2,2640,4.941043083900227

Meryl Streep's role isn't difficult, but she's fun to watch and effective enough to distract you from the well-worn plot.  The heroine is more believable as a fashion trollop than a serious journalist. The saucy co-worker is too stereotyped, and a collection of friends only adds filler and backdrop to the story.

1561587,4,B00005JP0C,"The staff of Runway Magazine are as elegant as Gucci sunglasses. Self-confident, good looking, they only fear one person: their boss. Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).

Looking like some high fashion version of Cruella De Vil, Miranda is terryfing, ruthless, demanding and determined; qualities that made the most powerful woman in the bussines and thus, the most feared. She is the high-priestess of fashion; she doesn't follow the trends, she sets them.

Into this merciless world enters the wide-eyed and geeky Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway). With Miranda always scarring off assistants, an opportunity has arisen to take an opportunity at the job ""a million girls would kill for."" Turns out Andy is not one of them, being one of the few women in New York who isn't aware of who Miranda is and her fearsome reputation. This refreshing confession, is enough to persuade Miranda to hire her.

Taking her position behind Miranda's first assistant Emily (the wonderful Emily Blunt), Andy learns why her boss changes assistants like handbags. She also learns what is required to make it in the cut-throat fashion business, placing her personal life second to the needs of her boss. That and transforming her plain image into a wild fashionista.

Based on the book of the same name by Lauren Weisberger, The Devil Wears Prada is a devilicious look at the high fashion industry. The brilliant Streep loses herself in the role of the satanic Miranda. But she also humanizes her, showing us bits of the real woman beneath the designer clothes. Miranda wields a great deal of power, and knows it, but she also knows exactly what price she has paid to be at the top of the fashion game. But as Andy notes, if Miranda were a man, no one would even question that; they'd just admire how successful she was at her job.

There lies the truth buried deeply in the heart of Prada: the world of professional careers take a higher price from women than from men. A man can be a demanding boss, so long as he's great at what he does, and people will not only put up with it, but respect him for it. A woman like Miranda, on the other hand, is considered a ""devil"" for doing the same thing.",1187654400,3,2167,4.692105263157894

Meryl Streep plays the head of a fashion magazine and Anne Hathaway her new assistant. How Meryl Streep managed to get a Best Actress nomination for a role in this film beggars belief. Anne Hathaway is quite cute but somebody with a bit more spunk could have made more out of it e.g. Kirsten Dunst.

The undemanding, inoffensive plot and the casting of Hathaway would lead one to believe the filmmakers were trying to appeal to the ""Princess Bride"" audience of Hathaway rather than the ""adult"" audience of Streep.

1561640,5,B00005JP0C,"All that buzz that surrounded Meryl Streep's Oscar-Nominated performance in `The Devil Wears Prada' was deserved, seriously.  But what gets me is the fact that she's really the only one who got the attention despite the fact that three other performances carry this movie just as well as she does, and one of them even outshines her quite a bit.  This is truly an extraordinary movie because it had all the potential to become nothing more than summer comedy tripe but instead, thanks to the wonderful script and brilliant comedic performances, it became one great movie.  From Streep's Cruella turn to Hathaway's wide-eyed innocence to Tucci's comedic timing to the magnificent scene stealing Blunt in what should have landed her an Oscar, everyone here contributes to the greatness that is `The Devil Wears Prada'.

The film follows Andrea, a young journalist looking to make it big who finally gets a shot when she interviews for Miranda Priestly, editor of a New York fashion magazine.  She gets the job despite the fact that Miranda seems disinterested in her, but soon she finds that her new found profession may not be what she's been praying for.  Miranda is ruthless, able to be so successful because she has no heart, but this again is further proof that all that awards attention was justified.  Streep plays Priestly with so much conviction and emotion.  She's cold hearted and distant, but Streep gives her layers that we can find if we're willing to look.

The question though is will Miranda destroy Andrea's good natured soul?

Anne Hathaway is just darling in this film.  I'm really excited for where her career is headed.  I do feel bad for her in the fact that so far she's been in two films garnering other members of her cast awards attention while she just sits back and watches.  Maybe more so with `Brokeback Mountain' since everyone BUT her received an Oscar nomination, but even here when her performance was far more leading than Streep's yet Streep stole her thunder.  Alas, her performance is still memorable and I'm sure this young star is bound for some attention in the near future.  Stanley Tucci is also fantastic here as Priestly's right hand man.  He takes Andrea under his wing and shows her the ropes, helping her to make it in the cut throat world belonging the Miranda.  He's hilarious to watch, but still can't rise above the brilliance that is Emily Blunt.  Her performance here is comedic bliss.  She has the most memorable lines in the film, and her character is a piece of heaven.  Why she got passed up for the nomination for the 6-year old (8, 9 whatever) from the Sunshine movie is beyond me!

So, the movie is great, literally.  I was actually shocked to like it as much as I did.  The plot may not really be anything new, and the moral lesson may be the same generic been-there-done that `learn to be a good person and not let the world change you just so you can succeed' type plot that most movies in this genre possess but it does it in such a fresh and exciting way that it's worth every single second.  So yes, Streep is brilliant and deserves the praise, but let's not forget the equally impressive performances that only added to her screen brilliance.",1186358400,4,3209,4.689285714285714

[Andrea's size 6 is actually the new 14!]. When demanding ice-queen Streep removes her glasses and reveals eyes made swollen by the news that her latest husband is divorcing her, her character is rescued from one-dimensionality.

This movie is awful, even as a chick-flick guilty pleasure it's awful.  The plot is hackneyed to the point of exhaustion, the ending is glib and facile, the characters are so two dimensional that when they turn sideways all you can see is the label, and the engine driving the alleged action - the scary power of Miranda Priestly - emanates from her ability to determine what color sweater the likes of us will be wearing next year.  In sum - it's the fashion industry folks - it doesn't matter - compared to this world cotton candy looks substantial.

Now the good news.  Anne Hathaway is adorable as Andy Sachs, and makes her ridiculous role believable - she sells it.  She's as appealing in jeans as she is in couture.  Stanley Tucci is perfect - perfect - as Nigel.  I have never seen Tucci turn in a bad performance - he is absolutely amazing.  The role would have been easy to send over the top but Tucci nails it with restraint and class, fantastic.

Of course the showcase here is Meryl Streep - and honestly - although it's heresy - I've never cared much for her work.  Sadly her role is not even two-dimensional, it's almost one-dimensional - but she carries it off so well that you just don't care.  It's a hoot watching her, and she's obviously having a ball.  As you might imagine, it's a visually pleasing movie, the fashion plates just keep passing by, which is fun.  Male characters fare badly, Andy's boyfriend is a waste of atoms and her bad boy love interest is completely unconvincing as a straight male putting the moves on a woman.  Special bonus points to Emily Blunt who turns in an outstanding performance as Priestly's assistant Emily - she perfectly embodies the neurotic cattiness and one-upsmanship of the industry.

First of all Meryl Streep-Hack pretty much phoned in this performance, very LOWWWWWWW voice and spoke SLOOOOOWWWWLLLYYYYY. Not much different than any other part she's played and let's get honest here: Meryl Streep-Hack has been a hack in every movie since ""Sophie's Choice."" She never changes character. This character was pretty much a rip-off of what she played in ""Death Becomes Her."" OK? And the wig! Sorry Meryl, you're not yet 60 and you looked 70!

Anne Hathaway: Loved her in ""Brokeback Mountain"" and I'd never seen her before. She handled a difficult role very well.

1561649,4,B00005JP0C,"Obviously this weekend my wife had control of the television.  That's alright though because whenever that happens I usually end up having lower expectations then usual and find the viewing experience to be better than expected.  This was not the case with The Devil Wears Prada, as this little movie did have a lot of hype, even among movie snobs and cinephiles like me.  It seemed that critically this was on a higher level than the chick flicks I typically find myself rolling my eyes to after my wife has gained control over the television.  After the viewing I think it is fair to say that The Devil Wears Prada deserves every bit of praise it has received in 2006.

From what I understand this movie was adapted for the screen from a novel written a few years ago.  Andrea or Andy (Anne Hathaway) is a new Northwestern graduate and somewhat nerdy and awkward girl who just received a job as a co-assistant for a highly demanding editor of a fashion magazine named Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Andy is at least awkward and nerdy in Miranda's competitive and ostentatious world.  Most girls would love Andy's opportunity but Andy doesn't seem to care and for a while even sees herself as above the fashion culture.  Andy fails to fit in well and it grates on her.  She is also employed by a horribly demanding boss in Priestly.  Miranda Priestly is notorious and after some time Andy begins to enjoy the challenge, especially after the entire supporting cast in the film doubts she can last.  Also, Andy's opportunities will expand tremendously if she can prove to exist under Miranda for a significant amount of time.  There are good side plots and certain developments which I won't reveal, but rest assured the film is fun.

The screenplay is written to be palpable to a wide audience and that can make a film outside of this viewer's favorite genres more entertaining.  However, it is the cast in The Devil Wears Prada that makes it a success.  Meryl Streep definitely delivered one of the most effective comedic performances I have seen in years.  Her nomination for an Oscar was well-deserved for several reasons. I hold out hope that it is her understanding of the dry humor and arrogance in Miranda's character that earned her the nomination and not the mushy scenes that typically earn attention from the Academy.  Meryl is outstanding and the character allows for an amazing display of her talent.  To Anne Hathaway's credit, she holds her own in each scene and her ability to make Andy likeable in a situation where I could've just as easily sympathized with the villain deserves some praise as well.  I was even more surprised by the supporting cast here, especially Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci who played distinctively different roles than I'm used to seeing them play.

The Devil Wears Prada is a not a profound film that attempts to comment on larger things.  If it did, it would've failed.  That isn't to say the film lacks depth entirely and manages not to say anything.  It has its points.  I had trouble at first trying to figure out where The Devil Wears Prada stood as a critique of the fashion culture it is showing us, but that was not what the film set out to do.  The fashion world is merely the film's setting to tell this story.  One of the best messages I got from The Devil Wears Prada also happened to be the one that placed the film squarely against the grain of on-the-surface similar stories.  The story allowed me to pragmatically support its villain.  If Miranda Priestly were a man she would have the respect of her colleagues but instead they fear her.  That point brought The Devil Wears Prada away from conventional comedy and into a coming of age story for Andy as in many ways she began to respect Miranda just as we do.  It cut much deeper than I expected, even with all that hype.",1184457600,7,3834,4.635555555555555
1561698,4,B00005JP0C,"For me the movie did what the book could never do. It bought life and a human angle to this story. I just didn't find the book and its style particuarly good this is such a visual theme it really works on the screen. There are some absolute classic lines and scenes. Meryl Streep really works as the editor, she is cold, hard, deadly and oh so quiet with it. To me it was Stanley Tucci who stole every scene he was in. I can't see how he does it, he just seems to nail the character he plays with a combination of wit and sensitivity. Extraodinary!

This is the story of Andrea (Andy) who lucks into a job with Runway - the magazine of the American fashion world. Only she doesnt' really want it. It is when she laughs during one of Miranda's fashion scenes that she gets put in her place. Miranda picks apart the jumper she is wearing and its 'cerulean blue' - when it first appeared on the runway, who picked it up next and where it went - showing that Andy was as much a victim of fashion industry as anyone.

Andy decides she wants the job and goes all out to make herself the ideal (second) assistant.  She proves too good for the job having more of a relationship with Miranda than with her own friends, and finding out that fancy consumer goods don't retain friends, or a boyfriend.

There are some utterly hilarious lines in this. All the women are starving themselves down to size 2 and 4 (or less) and Miranda's first assistant confides her diet to Andy - she just starves herself and when she thinks she is going to faint she eats a small piece of cheese. If only this was really a joke!

A great fun watch.",1184284800,3,1618,4.240259740259741
1561699,3,B00005JP0C,"This movie does not accurately reflect the tone of the book, as a result of a very conscious decision not to do so.

The concept of the book is that Andy's boss is ""the devil"".  She's awful.  She's a nightmare of a boss.  She intimidates all of her employees.  She is not just demanding with them, she is sadistic with them.  She lies to them, puts them through hell for her own amusement, constantly berates them, breaks them down, wrecks them.

Meryl Streep in the movie is nothing like that.  She is the Disney version.  She is Carol Burnett at that time of the month, a bit cranky.

The book's title villain could best be played by that snippy British lady who hosted The Weakest Link.  She would be perfect for the role of Miranda Priestly.

If she were not available for the movie, I'd cast Cruella DeVille in the role.  She hasn't had a decent starring role since knocking us dead with 101 Dalmatians.

The book made a statement about the fashion industry being a bad influence on young girls, turning them into self hating anorexics.  The movie did no such thing, and in fact took it in the opposite direction, showing a very positive image of the fashion industry.

The most entertaining part of the book was simply left out.  I loved when Andy tried to get into her office building, in a mad hurry, loaded down with four Starbucks coffees and a few dozen scarves, and the security guard at the entrance locked the turnstile, refusing to let her in the building until she sang to him.  I can't believe they left that out.  It was the most fun thing in the book.  And it also set up the big finish in the book, when this same security guard showed respect for Andy as he played with the new girl in the same way he used to tease Andy.

All in all, I wish they were truer to the book, because I think it was a very good book.  The movie was good in its way, and had a good ending, but I really wish that these film people would show more respect for the original author and I wish they didn't Disnify things.",1184112000,2,2015,4.289124668435013

1561701,3,B00005JP0C,"Having just read the book, I decided to check out the movie as well. Streep was excellent as Miranda Priestly and managed to capture the viciousness of the original character. Hathaway was also good as well. What I didn't enjoy was the changed ending. I wish that Andrea Sachs had confronted Priestly in Paris (and told her off) like she did in the book. I think the movie missed much of the bitterness of Andrea's wasted year and made it too much of a learning experience for her. The fact that some reviewers could come out of the theatre thinking that this was a story about empowered women shows that the movie didn't get the right tone at the end.

An another note, the volume on this DVD is way off. I found it nearly impossible to hear some of the dialogue, even though I had it on full blast. Then the music would overwhelm me. They didn't calibrate it well.",1183766400,,866,4.37888198757764

She's earnest, and cute, and bright -- but Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, queen of fashionistas and priestess of the Dark Side of the Force, is spectacular. As the tagline says, Miranda is ""hell on wheels."" Sadistic, hyper-demanding, not knowing when to quit, lacking in the most basic humanity, willing to blow another marriage, happy to sacrifice everything and everyone around her, convinced that no one else in the universe is capable of doing her job. And yet ""a million girls would kill"" for Andy's job. It takes awhile, but Andy eventually (of course) discovers she's becoming too much like Miranda and manages to save herself at the last minute.

The Devil Wears Prada movie left me asking for more. I left feeling that I wanted to know more about what Andy Sachs had in store for herself. Nonetheless, she did do quite a bit of growing the year she worked for Meranda Priestly at Runway. Her transformation was stunning.

This movie was great! It showed stylish characters, and fabulous New York and Paris Scenes.

Meryl Streep also did a marvelous job at playing Miranda Priestly. I bet is was difficult to keep a straight face all the time. In fact, a little birdy told me that she didn't even talk to Anne Hathaway off-set so that she would be able to stay in character.

For example, Andy's (Hathaway's) boyfriend in the film is not the same as he is in the book.  I guess they had to make some changes so that the film wasn't so long.  My advice is to read the book!  I enjoyed the book more than the film.

There aren't too many films that feature a successful (and in this case, ruthless) business woman, much less manage to be entertaining in the process.

Knowing nothing about the fashion industry, I also found this film educational, although I tend to doubt the oft-repeated mantra that ""a million girls want your (Anne Hathaway's) job."" It seems to me that most of the intelligent young woman I know have their heads screwed on properly and aren't about to be diverted by an ill-advised foray into a snake pit.

Still, this is a entertaining film, and a lot of fun. The ending, as indicated in the above title, is both weak and unbelievable. In fact, the entire film would have been a lot better without the secondary romance between Anne and her boyfriend.

She's the editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine ""Runway."" She gives orders in a quiet tone of voice, and dismisses her underlings with a near-whispered ""that's all."" At the start, we see several of the young women, who we'll meet shortly, dressing for work (to the sound of KT Tunstall's ""Suddenly I See""), and hailing cabs to get there. All, that is, except for ingenue Anne Hathaway, who wants a job in journalism. She shows up (via subway) in the sort of getups she probably wore to her college special occasions to apply for the job of Streep's no. 2 assistant--having no idea who Streep is or, for that matter, much about fashion. Hathaway, a less-than-ugly Betty type, has a live-in boyfriend and hangs with a Boho crowd, and when she gets the job (much to the annoyance of Streep's number 1 assistant, played to a T by Emily Blunt), she starts out looking askance at the fashionistas (she giggles at two belts, each with a slightly different color blue)--and receives a lecture on fashionable colors from Streep.

Streep, who announces her arrival each morning by tossing her coat on Hathaway's desk, wears her assistant down. In despair, Hathaway finally tells Streep's no. 2, Stanley Tucci, that she's at the end of her rope, and after a pep talk from him she realizes at last that what seems amusing to her is taken dead seriously by her colleagues. She starts dressing for the part, mostly in freebies acquired from the various samples sent to the magazine by designers hoping for a writeup.

The movie is done well. Director David Frankel apparently knows more than a thing or two about pacing and timing. And he avoids cliches for the most part.

1561852,4,B00005JP0C,"The Devil Wears Pravda is a pretty good movie though the terms ""cliched"" and ""predictable"" are pretty apt.  The acting is quite good and Meryl Streep is absolutely perfect for her role as the consumed business woman whose ambitious dream has become nightmare for herself as well all who fall under her rule.

There are some genuinely funny moments in the movie, mostly by Stanley Tucci's character.  His ascerbic wit and resigned nobility under fire is, perhaps, the best character study in the whole work.  Without revealing too much for those who may not have seen it, his short speech when he receives the worst disappointment of his life, is absolutely superb, both in delivery and content.  It sums up the whole relationship that a person has to have in order to work with, live with and be consumed by, a high achieving, powerful creature such as Miranda Priestly (Streep).  For all those who contemplate the world of power and recognition, whatever the industry, note well  from Tucci what such life entails.

There were a couple of things in the movie which causes one to chuckle about things that the director probably didn't intend.

First - there is the hilarious idea that Hathaway, dressed in school girl kitsch, is somehow supposed to be seen as plain.  The woman walks into the office for her intial job interview and is promptly laughed to scorn by women wearing very expensive clothes that seem inspired by a Salvation Army window display.  Hathaway glows no matter what she is wearing and it was truly hilarious watching the director attempt to convey her as somehow less glamorous than those laughing at her.  It was necessary to the plot but in order to tell a story about an ugly duckling turning into a swan, you have to start with an ugly duckling.

Second - there is the scene where Streep proceeds to flay Hathaway alive for snickering when a fashion decision between two nearly identical belts is being made.  Streep proceeds to enlighten Hathaway about the true vocation of Designer clothing.  She talks of art, of how the decisions that are made trickle down into the lives of the masses, how the world is somehow made a more beautiful place, how children are nurtured, how truth is advanced, how love is fostered (OK, so I'm embellishing a bit), etc. etc.  In another generation of movies, it was the kind of scene where heavenly music would start playing in the back ground.  Her purpose was to raise Hathaway's conscience by revealing that the fashion industry is NOT all about elitism, about faddish manufacturing of taste, about culturaly snobbishness, about insider cutural incest.  Yeah, right.  See, point one above.

Third - there is the scene where the earnest and concerned father travels to see his daughter because he is worried about how this new job is consuming his daughter.  She is never home.  She is running around too much chasing after the whims of her boss.  She is not taking time for herself.  Etc. etc. etc.  In a gesture of love and compassion he gives her some money because he is afraid she is not making the rent.  In all of this, there is not one single concern raised over the fact that the woman is living with her boyfriend in the apartment whose rent needs paying.  Post-modern ethics do not triumph in this movie, they are never questioned.  When Hathaway awakens after a one-night fling it is passed over and forgotten, a mere burp in the digestion of bigger portions.  Sex is incidental, being true to one's self, to one's friends, to the inner nobility which one must be concerned to preserve and nuture and promote, is the message of the movie.

 ""To thine own self be true"" , Polonius advises Laertes, but Shakespeare had an idea that being true had some meaning other than personal inclination, else Hamlet would not have been plagued by his conscience.  In this movie, the message about being true to one's own self, is far less morally instructive.  Miranda Priestly (Streep) perhaps gives us better insight into its true nature.  She is ""true to herself"" to a fault, sacrificing time with her charming twin children (a bit of an anomaly here), ruining her marriages, and sitting, alone, without makeup, wearing a common bathrobe, in an expensive hotel room in Paris.  Yet as she reviews the cost, rehearsing it as a means of revealing the essential humanity that lies beneath her hard-bitten exterior, she arrives at the inevitable conclusion.  It is worth it.  This is her life.  What ever price she has to pay or whatever price she requires other to pay, so that she may be Miranda Priestly, it is worth it.

With no external standards to guide us, the inevitable progression of human pride will direct our steps, large or small, down this path.  The Devil Wears Pravada is a fairy tale, Little Red Riding Hood  walks in the dark forest of the Fashion Industry and is saved from the wolf that seeks to gobble her up.  But  one has to wonder, based on how the movie ends, if the salvation she receives, is just at the hand of another wolf in different clothing.",1177372800,3,5035,4.712814645308924
1561913,4,B00005JP0C,"This is the film adaptation of a best selling novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberg. My daughter, who loved the book, was home visiting and suggested that we rent the film. We did so and really enjoyed it. The film is a tightly scripted, well-directed one with excellent performances.

The story turns around an aspiring journalist, Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who lives with her hunky boyfriend, Nate (Adrien Grenier), an aspiring chef. Having just graduated from college, Andrea is looking for a job and improbably gets one working for a top notch fashion magazine. Her job is to be second assistant to the Editor-in Chief herself, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a veritable dragon lady before whom everyone kowtows. It is a job for which many would give their eyeteeth to have. Andrea, however, sees it just as a way station stop to becoming a legitimate journalist, as she is not at all interested in fashion, as evidence by the way she dresses.  Meanwhile, for Emily (Emily Blunt), the catty and acerbic newly promoted first assistant that lives in fear of Miranda Priestly, her job is her life.

Thrust into the fashion maelstrom and thought of  as a size six fatty by all the size zeros with which she works, Andrea begins to change as the perks that go along with working for such a powerhouse fashion rag become apparent. The magazine's stylist (Stanley Tucci) ultimately helps Andrea pull together a look that serves to quell all criticism about her fashion sense.  This affects the way she dresses and, ultimately, the way she acts, as she starts emulating, to some degree, the dragon lady herself.  Moreover, the suave, sexy, and sophisticated Christian (Simon Baker), who is a serious and successful writer, sweeps Andrea off her feet.  As her relationships with her boyfriend and friends start to head south due to Andrea's absorption with her career, Andrea gets a wake-up call. The only question is whether she will answer it.

Ms. Hathaway give a coltish and engaging performance as our erstwhile journalist, and Adrien Grenier is appealing as her heart stoppingly hunky, personal chef. Christian Baker is dead sexy as the serious writer who has designs on Andrea. Stanley Tucci gives a strong performance as the stylist who helps Andrea overcome her fashion faux pas. Emily Blunt is terrific as the harried first assistant.  The standout, however, is Meryl Streep. Her coolly understated, low key performance as the ruthless and powerful Miranda Priestly gives conviction to the adage that less is more.

1561914,5,B00005JP0C,"I used to work for someone who was exactly like Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestly (although it wasn't in a journalism setting, unfortunately), so I could relate to this movie all too well.

Anne Hathaway's character of Andy Sachs was exactly the way I felt while working for this individual, and I could see myself living with my job the way Andy did with hers.  I felt like a new person when I finally quit that hellhole.

I never did have the time for individuals such as the shallow and self-important people featured in the movie.  Everyone is out for #1, everyone is the boss, everyone is the only one who ""gets it,"" and there's a tremendous amount of unnecessary backstabbing and cattiness that goes on.  And the ring leader of the circus (the head boss) just likes to see everyone jumpy and miserable (as Andy stated in a moment of frustration).

Meryl Streep, as always, played a believeable mega-boss in Miranda Priestly.  She was so good that I had to remind itself it was just acting.  Anne Hathaway was her usual charming self.  She has worked very well with legendary actresses (who can actually act!) such as Streep and Julie Andrews and her movies with them are enjoyable to watch.

""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a great movie to show people the pitfalls of tossing aside everyone and everything that you know and love in your quest for number one - and how empty, lonely, and full of ""drama"" being at the top can be.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1176508800,4,1457,4.565384615384615

Wow, what a horrible movie in every way. The over-the-top cuteness, the dumbed down script and generic characters - all awful.

Despite their supposed intentions, it seems to me that movies like this are actually really demeaning to women. I know it's supposed to be a ""chick flick"" but how I don't see how most women don't find this movie completely insulting and condescending.

Aside from all that, this film uses the same old trick of finding a hot chick and dressing her up in a sweater to make her ""ugly."" And ""fat."" Oh, and I'm sure everyone who works at a fashion magazine making $40k a year is a ridiculously hot model.

I know I didn't finish the movie, but I find it hard to believe anything that happens in the second half could possibly forgive the first half.

1561921,4,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada,"" based on the famously-hilarious novel, is a fairly conventional, if glossy, coming of age tale.  Despite a pretty funny script (watered down from the book) and the usual acting talent present in a major Hollywood production (Anne Hathaway in the title role, Stanley Tucci as a flamboyant designer, etc.), the movie is saved from mediocrity by the performance of Meryl Streep.

This wonderful actor, who made her name in such ""difficult"" movies as ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" and ""Kramer versus Kramer,"" sinks her teeth into the role of Miranda Priestley, the editor in chief of ""Runway,"" a fashion magazine.  Priestley has dyed her hair the charming color of steel on a cold day and is one of the leading lights of the fashion world.  She also is the most demanding and unreasonable boss since Kevin Spacey in ""Swimming With Sharks.""  To say that Streep takes on this role with glee is an understatement.

But Priestley is the villain of this piece (or is she . . .).  The heroine is Andrea Sachs (Ms. Hathaway).  A recent graduate of Northwestern University and editor of the prestigious student paper, Ms. Sachs has come to New York with hopes of writing for Vanity Fair or The New Yorker.  Thanks to the screenplay, Andrea gets a job that she doesn't want but is one - as she is told repeatedly - that ""a million girls would kill for.""  This is one of those ""too-good-to-be-true"" situations one encounters only on movies or TV - kind of like the apartment on ""Friends.""  But it's needed as a plot device - you couldn't tell a coming-of-age story about a girl who knew that a million girls got the job and still got the job, because that girl knows how the world works.

So commences the education of Andrea.  At first, Andrea - like many in the audience - looks down on the fashion world as super-silly fluff.  Things begin to change as she sees what a dynamic business mind Miranda has, and also when Miranda gives Andrea the detailed fashion history of the frumpy blue sweater she wore to work that day.  Eventually, Andrea sees the light, and after a helpful fashion lesson from Stanley Tucci, starts to wear great clothes and also stop eating so she can become a reasonably satisfactory size 4.

This sets up a typical scenario where Andrea starts to lose her old friends to the demands of her job.  Her boyfriend - who looks 18 but will end up becoming the sous chef for a pretigious restaurant (yeah, right) - is typically unsupportive.  The only friend who showed promise was a guy who showed an unnerving fascination with fashion, but that subplot goes nowhere.  But these friends serve as the counterpoint to Miranda, setting up the ultimate choice for Andrea - who does she want to be?  Rich, famous and unhappy, like Miranda?  Or herself?  Ten cents if you guess who she wants to be.

Ultimately, this is what is unsatisfying about the movie.  Miranda is not unhappy - she loves who she is and wouldn't be anyone else.  It's just for Miranda, things like a marriage come second.  But we never get a sense of who Andrea wants to be - she's nice, but we see nothing of what animates her as a journalist.  Does she want to be a globe-trotting foreign correspondent?  A literary critic?  An advice columnist?  We are left to wonder, but then we already know that we are more interested in Miranda than Andrea anyway.

A fine movie for the younger set - a lot of young people could benefit from even the most shallow bit of introspection.  But if you're looking for a great movie, skip ""The Devil Wears Prada.""  That is, unless you want to watch Meryl Streep give a master's class in acting.",1176076800,,3629,4.594090202177294
1561922,4,B00005JP0C,"THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA features the fabulous Meryl Streep in her most cattily-comedic performance since ""Death Becomes Her"".  She plays Miranda Priestly, the revered and feared editor-in-chief of Runway, the most popular fashion magazine on the planet.

A sweet, clever but fashion challenged girl Andy (Anne Hathaway) who dreams of becoming a writer suddenly finds a job, ""million girls would kill for"", as a second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the draconian demanding editor of the most prestigious fashion Runway magazine in New York City. The job description - to be available for her boss 365/24/7 and to be ready for the labors that even the legendary Hercules would not be able to accomplish.

The movie about fashion industry is always fun to watch and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is not an exception. I loved the look, the clothes, the shoes (OMG!!), the bags, the clips from the fashion shows. Stanley Tucchi is memorable in the supporting role - this guy is seriously underrated. Anne Hathaway is very likable and she's got beautiful eyes and lips. But THE main reason to see the movie is Meryl Streep who reigns and over-towers everything in it as the Uber-[...] Miranda Priestly. She should play the roles like that more often. Big thumbs up! She looked very sexy too. What I did not like - in the film her Miranda comes up somehow sympathetic. In the book she was totally heartless, self-obsessed and manipulating. There are some changes in the script comparing to the book that make Andy's final decision rather unconvincing. What happened in the book made it much more believable. When it comes to the story and the reasons for Andy's feeling guilt, the movie gets weak. I did not see any betrayal or losing the integrity or selling the soul there. Quoting a friend, ""She did NOT manipulate or back stab or undermine her co-worker. She did a better job. And was rewarded. That is NOT betrayal."" And one more thing - why did her friend make such a big deal out of Andy's rather innocent conversation with Christian Thompson at the Art show? With all these ""serious"" conflicts, the movie should be called ""Much Ado About Nothing"". Once again, bravo to Meryl Streep for her fantastic performance.",1175904000,,2011,4.759312320916905
1562017,5,B00005JP0C,"Meryl Streep was absolutely astounding in this movie.  I'm not a fashionista or even pretend to understand the whoopla surrounding that world.  However, TDWP is a character study movie that entertains and spins out some life lessons.  I do agree with Andrea's take.  If Miranda was a man no one would have said jack about his impossible demands or even blink of what is sacrificed for the sake of success in the business world.  Andrea's ugly ducking transformation is but a small part of the movie.  And frankly if she thinks the rules are any different in the world of hard hitting journalism then she's in for another eye opening experience.  Tucci was also equally impressive in his performance.  But over all I think the screenwriters and the director did a remarkable job on such mediocre ""best selling"" book.  I love how in the special features section the trip to the big screen that they all but admitted that the book was just one dimensional.  Over all.  Great movie.",1175817600,,978,4.727810650887574
1562018,3,B00005JP0C,"This movie is not a tragedy, a comedy, a drama,a parody, or even a satire although it comes close at times.  It seems to be a cross between a Docudrama and a Docu-satire.  Meryl Streep's performance is excellent and her scene as she announces her divorce raises her performance to its well deserved Oscar nomination.  The screen play does an excellent job of portraying the attitude of entitlement displayed by many top executives as Streep treats her employees as her personal servants.  She is a driven executive that has no life outside of her job and doesn't expect her employees to have one either -- they are there to serve her.  Like most senior executives she is ruthless, self-absorbed, and acts only in her own self-interest.  While this movie accurately describes my experience with senior executives the movie doesn't accurately portray the end game.  Ann Hatheway's character is living in a dingy apartment with some scuzzy guy who looks like he hasn't bathed in six months.  As she climbs the ladder and is exposed to the rich and powerful she is transformed into a player.  This is very logical and it happens but in the end she throws this away and goes back to the unkempt and unhygenic loser.  This was totally unrealistic.  I liked the movie but only gave it three stars because it fell apart at the end.  Once a player -- always a player.",1175731200,3,1358,4.6835443037974684
1562019,4,B00005JP0C,This is a realistic portrayal of high fashion.  Perhaps a bit more.  It looks a little puffed-up to me.  In any case I would recommend a look especially if you like fashion.  Has nice story as well.,1175731200,,198,4.27027027027027
1562020,5,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a funny fast-paced story about the world of high fashion.  Meryl Streeps' performance is riveting.  She has two Oscars (Best Supporting Actress for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" 1979 & Best Actress for ""Sophie's Choice"" 1982).  ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was her 13th Oscar nomination.  For this film she won awards from the Golden Globes, London Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Satellite Awards and Women's Film Critics Circle.  Her performance is an amazingly controlled one.  We see her as the quintessential difficult boss with snide quips and impossible demands.  The scene that totally makes the film for me is the one where she sits in the hotel in Paris without makeup and tells Andy about her latest divorce.  Her disappointment is so real, muted and emotionally deep that it throws all of the rest of the character into perspective.

Anne Hathaway's performance is easy to overlook, even though it is the lead.  Her basic chore as Andy Sachs is to make us like her.  She accomplishes this.  She goes from the one they call ""the fat girl"" to a high fashion professional meeting all of the demands and repeatedly placing job over her personal life.  At the film's climax, she makes her decision & changes course.  She doesn't have any wild quirks like Streep's Miranda Priestly or Emily Blunt's Emily, but she makes the film accessible for the viewer.

British actress Emily Blunt plays the first assistant Emily.  (Did they rename the character or was this a coincidence?)  She won the Best Supporting Actress award from the London Film Critics Circle and has translated this high profile role into five upcoming films!  (""The Snow Goose,"" ""The Girl in the Park,"" ""Wind Chill,"" ""The Great Buck Howard"" & ""The Jane Austin Book Club."")  Her snide quips and cold exterior are hysterically superficial as she treats Andy with a ""kick the dog"" mentality.

Standley Tucci does a good job as Nigel.  His cold wisdom is so picky and prickly that we love to hate him instantly.  Adrian Grenier who was in several films I saw (""Cecil B. Demented"" & ""Hart's War"") plays her boyfriend Nate.  His wide-eyed, slightly ethnic good looks play well opposite Hathaway.  Australian Simon Baker plays the writer Christian Thompson who eventually beds Andy in Paris.  He oozes romantic charm.

""The Devil Wears Prada"" is about superficiality and artifice, which may make some think that the film isn't about anything significant.  But at its heart is the desire to get ahead and success at all costs.  It asks the cogent philosophical question, ""Does the end justify the means?""  However, it also presents a world of perfectionists for whom excellence is the standard.  I found the film funny and moving, filled with excellent performances.

Andy, who has never heard of the magazine or Miranda Priestly before her interview, is bewildered as she watches the Runway staff frantically running around in an effort to be ready when Miranda arrives early to work that day.  Also, Andy doesn't make a very good impression due to the lack of fashion sense that she apparently has.  However, though Miranda is initially not impressed with Andy, Andy taking an opportunity to speak up for herself ears her the privilege of working for Miranda in addition to Miranda's other personal assistant Emily (Emily Blunt).  Though thousands of women allegedly would do anything to work for Miranda, Andy's enthusiasm for the job is not great as she comes to grips with running errands such as getting coffee, buying scarves or some other odd, if not impossible, task (such as obtaining a copy of an unpublished ""Harry Potter"" novel) that Miranda expects to be completed usually sooner than is possible.  Andy is also reminded by Miranda, Emily and other Runway staff, such as Nigel (Stanley Tucci), that she dresses terribly and really isn't taking the job seriously.  Not wanting to be fired, Andy starts to make a greater effort to fit in as a Runway employee, which includes getting an entirely new wardrobe of top-designer fashions, but not with the approval of her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) or her other friends.

All in all, with good writing, brilliant acting (Meryl Streep earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actress), good direction under David Frankel and engaging characters, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a very entertaining film that earns 4 out of 5 stars.

What if she never saw her father again?...think about your priorities for a second and really consider what this movie portrays: A job in the industry that's supposed to represent the beauty in everyone, by humiliating the inner self and ridiculing INDEPENDENT SELF EXPRESSION!!!

Not even Streep's character portrays any sympathy for herself.  You would think that after witnessing her life crumble she would change, But NO.  This is not the case, not even a simple wink to her former BEST special-assistant.  What does that really say about anyone?

Meryl Streep definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Stanley Tucci never fails to amaze me.

That is what this movie was about, a lady named Andy landing a job as a journalist for a fashon company in New York City, and learns the hard way how to follow directions. Then she is being treated like crap and still has the strength to keep her job. It's real hard for her at first, but she learns the works and manages to keep her job, especially when she had to go get the typed manuscript for the Harry Potter book, that wasn't even printed yet. Also she chooses her job over friendships, in which comes back later on in the movie. Although this is just a movie, it somewhat teaches people (especially soon to be college graduates) on what can be expected at a job that they want at the entry position. You have to move heaven and earth just to please your boss, and he (or in this movie, she) won't even acknoledge you. I also did like the clothes that most of the actors wore. I bet most of the outfits costs at least $100,000. I believe living the life of a multi-millonare is overrated, and doubts anyone will enjoy it (not saying they want to live it though).

played in Prairie Home Companion, and you begin to get a

sense of this actresses extensive range. This role earned

her an Oscar nomination. Well deserved, I might add.

First-assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) would be only too

happy to sabotage Andy, but if she were fired just now

that would dash her dreams of attending the fashion events

in Paris. Lots of catty comments from her. My fav:

Emily: Okay, I am hearing this...

[She moves her hand in a speech mimiking sign]

Emily: And I want to hear this.

[She closes her hand]

Can't wait to use that one.

Art Director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) gives an excellent

performance, mentoring the ingenue, without ever losing

his satiric edge or giving in to the sacharine. Upon first

seeing her he dashes off the following withering remark:

Nigel: Who is that *sad* little person? Are we doing a

before-and-after piece I don't know about?

When she turns to him, after a particularly cruel session

of torture from Miranda, instead of sympathy he tells her

bluntly that she disrespects the Art of Fashion, the role

of the magazine, and the impact of Miranda upon that Art.

Nigel: Other girls dream of working here. You merely

deign.

Later, after seeing that Andy is smart and capable, and

trying to meet the challenges of her job, he gives her a

pair of Jimmy Chu high heels. She tells him they are not

for her, but soon after when Miranda glares at her

sensible shoes, she puts them on Tout de Suite. This is a

turning point for her character, who finally gets in the

game, embracing the world of fashion, and dances with the

devil. Andy is now known as Andrea, and she finally gets

some good barbs of her own, such as when sexy writer

Christian Thompson (Simon Baker) attempts to seduce her in

Paris:

Christian Thompson: Je suis trs, trs dsol.

Andy Sachs: You're not that dsol at all.

Anyway, the moral of this film (and anyone can see this coming) is that capitalists are unhappy if rich and, to be truly happy and save your relationships and your soul, you need to be an artist, sous chef or work for a newspaper. This is just another version of the usual Hollywood liberal propaganda against competition, hard work, big business and success spun as relationships are more important than money or cute clothes. Hey, Hollywood, how about a movie where the girl WANTS to be a success and financially well-off and doesn't want to work for peanuts for a liberal rag like the New York Times. And her boyfriend understands! Now THAT would be different, wouldn't it? Some critic called this a clever, funny adaption of Lauren Weisberger's novel, when really it is only funny to socialists.

Her ""Emily,"" what Streep calls her assistants, they don't last long, so they're all called Emily.  Anne Hathaway with the slim figure and botox lips plays the swell journalist student with a short, chef boyfriend, living as if they were on a Friends"" style sitcom in the big city.

Working for Streep, a fashion icon, playing footsy with handsome millionaires, and driving around in limos in a whirl of designer glamour, or attending runway shows in Paris are so, so, faux.

I'd say, okay, get the woman her coffee and make sure her plane can get out of LA in the middle of a tornado or blizzard, so that Paris Fashion might survive another day.  Remember all the little people that make it happen.  I'm paraphrasing one of Streep's restrained speeches on why Hathaway has clothes on her back.

Or maybe it was because Anne Hathaway was just coming off a one-two punch of daring roles in HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  Or, maybe it was because Lindsay Lohan WASN'T in the starring role.  I don't know WHAT it was, but somehow I got the impression that this was going to be an original and raucous take on the ridiculous fashion industry.  I thought we were going to see 13 GOING ON 30 meets HEATHERS or something like that.  I was prepared for ANYTHING other than what I got - a standard, paint-by-numbers, fish-out-of-water, Cinderella-story, PRINCESS DIARIES redux.

Alright, that's not quite fair. This actually is an entertaining movie.  Anne Hathaway ISN'T Lindsay Lohan (thank God) and does manage to engage you all the way through the film.  The writing is above average.

And of course, Meryl Streep is outstanding, as always.  Her scenes are each works of art - a distinguished actress still at the top of her game showing the rest of the world how its done!  You can't take your eyes off of her when she is on screen.  Even as the bane of Hathaway's existence, she is pure delight to behold.

But the problem is, all this only adds up to an average movie.  The film starts off with a bit of promise as Hathaway's Andrea applies for a job she is woefully unsuited for at a top fashion magazine.  Her hope is to use the prestige of the position to springboard into the more respectable world of journalism.  Early scenes have her balking at the lunacy of fashion types and their obsession with those ridiculous costumes.

After her third or fourth drubbing by Streep's delightfully ""devilish"" Miranda Priestly, Andrea receives a ""come to Jesus"" speech from Stanley Tucci (also a delight) and is presented with a choice:  quit the magazine, or take it seriously.  And folks, this is where the film enters familiar ground.

With help from Tucci, a little musical montage to pass the days away, and little other reason, Andrea suddenly becomes the perfect assistant to Miranda, even outshining Emily, the girl she is supposed to be learning from, played by Emily Blunt in her critically praised, screen-stealing role.

But of course, this success comes at the predictable price of her friendships and love life, until the predictable day when she predictably discovers that she is predictably becoming the very boss she loathed but predictably came to respect.  Which leads her to make a predictable choice for a predictably happy ending.

Yes, this film plays everything safe to ensure a standard audience-pleasing performance.  And it is a real shame, because for the briefest of moments, I saw in Anne Hathaway a hope that this film might elevate itself above the sea of mediocrity that it grew out of.  Films like 13 GOING ON 30 and JUST MY LUCK.  I really hoped Andrea was indeed going to excel at her job, but with the end goal of bringing down Miranda and her ridiculous magazine.  I had hoped for an ever-escalating series of fencing encounters between Miranda and Andrea.  Heck, maybe even a good bit of violence and mayhem to create a delicious dark comedy.

But, we get none of this - only a standard story of the simple girl who hits the big time, only to lose her friends and her own identity before making the right decision at the last moment!  Sigh - maybe next time.

The movie is worth watching for its stellar performances and slightly above-average writing . . . but in the end, it won't leave any lasting impression on you.",1172793600,3,3521,4.676422764227643

This movie was total fantasy, but not nearly as good as SITC, because the plot was empty.  Meryl Streep makes an otherwise silly movie even though she's a villain and you can't stand her. Don't you just love it when she throws her coat and handbag all around for others to pick up after her. Insane.  Never seen any boss do that before. And if they did, I'd quit. One time I worked for an attorney who yelled at me in front of everybody.  I told him off in front of everybody, and quit on the spot.  Anyway, the way she talks soooo under her breath, and treats everybody as if they were invisible toads made her too one dimensional.  The cast was adequate, and all and all it tried to be an entertaining film, but it had no real plot.  Just a bunch of idiots dressing up in clothes to show off, that few people could pull off, unless they were models. Few people are.

Little bit of Sex and the City flashbacks when Carrie went to work for Vogue and had a similar boss with Candice Bergen but Streep played the fashion queen much tougher and snobbish than Bergen.

1562232,4,B00005JP0C,"My lovely wife and I watched The Devil Wears Prada the other night.

On the whole I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh in all the right places, had some very nice moments of social commentary and satire, and Meryl Streep was, as usual, perfect.

The movie, however, was not.

It seemed not to know quite what it was. Now, I have not read the book from which it was adapted. I didn't even know it was adapted from a book. Of course, it's chick lit. Given the boyfriend's sensitivity and... well, he was a freakin' ""chick"" with chest hair, I should have realized exactly what it was.

Really it's too bad.

You see, Andy (Anne Hathaway) is a brill writer-""chick"" who graduated from New York University and gave up a prelaw scholarship to Stanford to get a job in the New York journalism field. As if. She hopes one day to write for the New Yorker.

How does prelaw at Stanford screw that up? I have no idea.

So after getting rejected at seven thousand other pubs, she finally gets a job working for the Dragon Lady of publishing, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) as a second assistant, a job thousands of ""chicks"" would ""kill for.""

Now Andy is a fashion disaster in Uggs and has to work for a semi-sane beyotch Emily (Emily Blunt) Did I get that right? Anyway, they play up the imperious nature of this Miranda to the hilt and beyond. If you'd been stabbed with this sword, the swordsman's elbow would be stuck in your spine. The only thing that saves the ridiculousness of it is Meryl herself. Anyone else would have surely overplayed it, but she toned it down and was so consistently believable that I forgot that this woman doesn't exist. That's why she was up for an Oscar last night despite a just-okay movie. That icy ""That's all"" of dismissal will stick with you after this movie has quite faded away.

Miranda takes a chance on the dumpy Andy because all of the fashion plates she'd hired before were a disaster. Maybe someone with more brains than bulimia would do a better job.

Of course, size 6 Andy is immediately singled out as fat. Whatever. She's hotter than rocket fuel, and certainly way hotter than Emily.

So after getting run through the ringer and verging on failure, she gets a little help from the other bright spot in the movie, Nigel (Stanley Tucci.) Stanley is pitch perfect as the effeminate yet manly Nigel, Miranda's second-in-command at the mag, and Andy's mentor-figure.

So what's her first step? Nigel turns her into a fashion plate. Amazing how that happens in these movies. Suddenly she's a damn runway model herself. All you need is to blow $15K at I. Magnin or whatever the heck. As soon as she's wearing Chanel and some pin-thin pumps, she's a perfect assistant.

The rest is the natural and somewhat predictable progression of getting to know thyself and deciding what to do about it. I won't blow the plot, but if I did, you wouldn't be surprised.

This movie could have been a lot more, could have been a little deeper look at the fashion world and the personalities without losing its funny-bone. Instead everything wraps up a little too neatly all around.

That said, it was certainly enjoyable and the ending does make you feel pretty good. I can't stress enough that Streep's run in this film is brilliant. The one moment of weakness you see in her character is captivating and very revealing. Of all the parts, Miranda rises above the level of caricature and finds real believability. If the rest of the movie had been written as well, and acted as well by the rest of the cast, this might have been a very different movie.

I would prefer to rate it as 3.5, but I give it a 4 because it was too good for a flat 3.",1172448000,,3662,4.500754147812971
1562233,2,B00005JP0C,"The problem I had with this film was that the plot was sadly lacking in terms of a story.

Meryl Streep was as beautiful as ever and she played her character perfectly.

The problem was that I was able to figure the whole plot out after maybe 30 minutes of the film and I didn't like that.  I knew what Andy would do, I knew what Miranda would do, and I knew where everyone was going to end up.

I would have liked a bit of substance to the story - some twists that would really shock the audience.  The plot as it was is really cut and dried.

Some ideas I came up with were - Emily really committing suicide because she had deeper problems and the trip was the last straw in a long line of disappointments?

Andy becoming just like Miranda and us seeing her in 10 years being the boss of the magazine and having no memory of who she used to be?

You get the idea - I had several more ideas on how the plot could go.  I'm sure that Meryl Streep could have handled any twists beautifully.

1562294,4,B00005JP0C,"Meryl Streep is surely the main draw to this movie. With one look, she shows her like or dislike. I especially like the way she pursed her lips, her admiration with one nod, two nods and the very rare smile she would give.

Emily Blunt and Stanley Gucci are wonderful. Anne Hathaway looked so attractive and classy in the second half of the movie. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in the limo letting their thoughts out were well presented and proved that Anne Hathaway could act and impress. Yet the movie was not as great as I expected.

Many a time the movie could not decide who the leading lady is. If it is Anne Hathaway, it failed because her performance was not consistent. It is one thing she had to display her lack in fashion sense, her ability to mix and match; it is quite another thing to deliberately dress her as bulky and unattractive. After all, she is a successful reporter at university with a brilliant resume. She can have brains as well as looks - casual as it may be. Second, if it is the fashion sense she lacks, the movie surely does not show much either. Compared with Project Runway or ANTM, fashion in this movie just focus on expensive clothes with not a single reference to fashion sense. Some dresses Anne Hathaway wore that were supposed to dazzle the room full of people did not really do her justice. Her other clothes at work were much more flattering. One can dress well without skyhigh price tags - just look at how good Anne Hathaway look in her leather jacket and jeans in the final scene.

More importantly, the script could have been bolder. It could not bring out Anne Hathaway as an intelligent, beautiful person with a dream, at least not in the first part of the movie. Here, there is no Melanie Griffth in Working Girl; no Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Only Meryl Streep can deliver throughout the movie.

For those who have heard little of the film (what rock have you been hiding under?), this is a tale of a young college-grad who is searching for an internship and her big break in the world of journalism in New York City - of course.  Wide-eyed and naive on many levels, Andie (Hathaway) stumbles, rather by accident, upon an assistant-to-the-publisher position at the premiere fashion magazine.  Knowing little (or nothing) about fashion, she akwardly fumbles through the first weeks of her internship until she transforms herself by inculturating (some might say ""selling out"") into the scene.

That's all...a look.  And there's more in that single look than most other actresses put into entire performances.  It conveys an extraordinary mix of disbelief, rage, vulnerability and a weird kind of admiration that's impossible to describe -- and all without a single word being spoken.  That's the kind of hidden pleasure one gets in this surprisingly substantial adaptation of what I gather was pretty skin-deep chick lit.  Having not read the book, I can't speak for the film as an adaptation, but as ""disposable"" entertainment, it's fast, funny and very, very entertaining.  The screenplay is snappy, the fashions are, of course, fabulous, and the supporting cast is (almost) up to Ms. Streep's standards, particularly the hilarious Emily Blunt.  Don't expect ""profound"" -- and why would you? -- and you'll be in for a rewarding two hour's worth of cinematic eye candy.",1172016000,,1074,5.102857142857143
1562297,5,B00005JP0C,"With the success of ""Ugly Betty"" on the small screen and now this movie on the big one, I'm guessing (or maybe just hoping) that the world might finally be starting to question its collective obsession with its facile media-driven ideals of beauty. I don't know anyone personally who works in the fashion media industry but the online forum buzz is that it's very much like depicted here (both ""Betty"" and ""Prada"" have 'the book', for instance - guard it with your life! - and apparently, all the top fashion mags have them) and if that's the case, why anyone would actually want to work in such a vacuous and cut-throat environment is totally beyond me.

But be that as it may, this movie, directed by Sex In The City man David Frankel, and based on the best-selling book by Lauren Weisberger, manages to remain respectful to the fashion media, raise some important issues while making me laugh hysterically at the same time. It's all good fun at the end of the day and maybe I take stuff too seriously. Anne Hathaway is great as Andrea Sachs, the girl who wants to be a journalist and believes that taking a job as 2nd assistant to Miranda Priestley, the editor-in-chief of 'Runway' magazine (played by Meryl Streep) is a step in the right direction towards achieving her goal. Andy doesn't give a hoot about fashion, (well, not to begin with anyway), doesn't know who Priestley is and even had to ask over the phone after apparently taking a call from someone at Dolce & Gabanna how 'Gabanna' is actually spelt!

Stanley Tucci as Nigel the catty art director, was also a lot of fun to watch as was Emily Blunt as Miranda's 1st assistant with the glass-cutting British accent, as was Simon Baker as the oily, smooth-talking charmer Christian Thompson, as was Andy's calm, collected, patient, down-to-earth and very supportive (not to mention very pretty) boyfriend Nate, played by Adrian Grenier. There are even cameo appearances by Heidi Klum, Bridget Hall and Valentino Garavani himself, all appearing as themselves at a Paris fashion show. It certainly added to the haute couture realism of the movie.

But it's Meryl Streep who's the absolute hoot here as the Galliano-clad Ice Queen bitch boss from hell (she must have had so much fun playing the role) and has gone on to earn herself a well-deserved Best Actress Oscar nomination. As one might expect, the movie has also earned an Achievement in Costume Design Oscar.

So, will Andrea survive her experience at Runway, or more specifically, will she survive Miranda?  Will she remain the same person and will any of her personal relationships survive? Will Andy come out the other end of her experience with Runway with the same well-adjusted, healthy attitude and belief system she went in with? I was certainly keen to find out.

Banging soundtrack too, including great songs by among others, KT Tunstall, Ray LaMontagne, Madonna, U2 and Jamiroquai.

The entire world revolves around this woman and don't you dare even think otherwise. Only once does the character show some vulnerability, but that soon passes and she's firmly back in the saddle.

The movie, even though trashed by some critics as ""shallow and unfulfilling"", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, ""Runway"", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.

All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the ""high-class"" laughs that it packs.",1171756800,,1208,4.4772727272727275

1562302,3,B00005JP0C,"Despite massive hype and great word-of-mouth reviews of ""Devil Wears Prada,"" I was somewhat disappointed in the overall quality of this movie. The parts are all there, but I found the substance pretty shallow. I did think Anne Hathaway was perfectly cast and her naivete and gradual education about the NYC Fashion World were sweetly portrayed and quite interesting. As good as she is, Stanley Tucci is even better: his Nigel rises above the stereotypical ""Fashion Queen"" and he gives a sensitive, perceptive portrayal of a man who has sacrificed love and even his identity to advance in this world. As for Meryl Streep, I hate to say it but I just wasn't impressed with her. Most of the critical Hosannas  are due, in my opinion, to the fact that she is a successful woman over 50 in a meaty role. But she plays Miranda Priestly in such a one-dimensional way that you feel nothing for her character. Her ridiculous behavior (tossing a fur onto a computer, demanding a steak in 10 minutes) is unbelievable - especially today. When she finally shows a human side, it is so forced and manipulating that it borders on offensive. Emily Blunt, Miranda's Assistant, fares only slightly better. I didn't hate this movie - it does have its moments - mainly thanks to Mr. Tucci - but I don't see what all the fuss was about.",1171584000,,1315,4.668103448275862

Everybody wants to be the next Coco Channel and the best designer. One has to understand that these big houses,really do not sell their runway designs, they make money by selling their accessories such as perfumes and so on. Runway designs are pieces of art, that is all.

Meryl Streep plays her character superbly. Her character is complex, for the person she is, is not necessarily the person she has allowed herself to become. Of course there is humor, idealism and rich glitz to add appeal to the movie, but in the end it is about choices, and perhaps the chance to do things differently albeit, vicariously.",1171411200,,537,4.546391752577319
1562355,5,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a most surprising treat. It is a fantastic movie that works on many levels - it is both a sharp satire and an ode to good stuff in life (clothes), both hilarious and dramatic. It manages to capture the world of not only fashion, but also its victims, so it will unapologetically make you feel like on high-heels after you're through with it.

Anne Hathaway plays Andrea, a down-to-earth girl fresh out of college. She couldn't care less if her sweater is blue or turquoise, because she wants to become a journalist, and good journalism doesn't have anything to do with looks, right? She is about to see how wrong she was, when she gets a job as a personal assistant of the first lady of fashion, Miranda Priestly, editor of a Vogue-style fashion magazine called ""Runway"". Hathaway is perfect for this role - her big eyes and a killer smile make us be on her side from the very first shot. However, she is not just a pretty face - her performance gives Andy substance, making her a not completely sympathetic character. She has an attitude when it comes to fashion, and it is refreshing, after zillion portrayals of rich people who do not notice sheer mortals, to see a character who looks down to those above her on the social scale, like Andrea does.

Guess what? Meryl Streep is amazing. After all those downers she has masterfully graced (""The Hours"", ""Music of the Heart"", ""Adaptation""), it is wonderful to see her do some comedy. Streep plays the title character and manages to make it her own. It would be easy to play Miranda like Glenn Close played Cruella DeVil, with cruel laughter and constantly raised voice. However, Miranda is always calm - her voice is low, but firm, and her movements are graceful, yet measured (in millimeters) - sometimes, she only lifts an eyebrow, or moves her chin. This makes the Devil scary, bossy and - here's the surprise - touching. It is an Oscar-worthy performance, and I am not even kidding.

Although Streep steals the show, and Hathaway is good enough to not be buried by her co-lead's on-screen presence, there are some other notable performances. Emily Blunt plays Miranda's other assistant with just the right dose of bitterness and vulnerability.  Stanley Tucci is great as Andy's sidekick, not overplaying his character. Also, the soundtrack is amazing - tracks like Madonna's ""Vogue"" or Mocean Worker's ""Tres Tres Chic"" are perfect in the movie's context. It is truly a movie to have on your shelf, and to watch it more than once. And then maybe read some ""Faust"" afterwards.",1171324800,2,2556,4.7242152466367715
1562356,3,B00005JP0C,"What ""The Devil Wears Prada"" lacks in substance and originality, it makes up for in scenery.  Lots of sexy, haute couture clothing fills the screen (and, if you listen to the commentary, you'll be treated to a piece by piece deconstruction of it all), and they are usually adorned by equally sexy actors and actresses, most of whom are required to do little more than wink and show off a sultry moue.

The story, about fish-out-of-water Andy Sachs (a cute-as-a-button Anne Hathaway) trying to make it as second assistant to the domineering ice queen Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), opts for easy outs every step of the way.  You have the Ugly Duckling Transformation (which isn't nearly as remarkable as this movie wants us to believe it is; Hathaway's good looks are tousled, not hidden, at the start of the film), the Crisis of Conscience (which is also hard to swallow; Andy ""betrays"" one of the most unlikeable characters in the film), and the Call to Reality (which includes one of the most over-used lines in film history: ""You've become one of them."").

Does Andy become one of ""them"" (""Them,"" in this case, being overly critical, weight-obssessed fashionistas)?  No.  Not really.  Unless you call wearing better clothing and working a lot more becoming one of ""them.""  It's hard to imagine a different outcome, when you are working as the assistant to the Editor-In-Chief of one of the world's largest fashion magazines.  Andy's friends (and, specifically, her milquetoast-dull boyfriend, Nate) exist like props to propel the barely-there moral agenda.  They are supposed to show us Andy's earthy, Good Time roots (they playfully toss her phone around when she gets a call from Miranda; what fun!), but they are also there to let the audience know when Andy has Gone Too Far (according to this movie, getting an unsolicited kiss on the cheek is enough to convict someone of infidelity).

That's dismissable.  What this movie is really about is Streep's icy Priestly, a tough, shale-edged woman who, if you look closely enough, lets a little humanity shine through her facade.  Streep restrains herself admirably, turning what could've been a one-note character into an entire symphony.  She is also aided by the excellent work of Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, one of Priestly's helmsmen.

Both of these characters (and the actors who give them life) take what could easily have been a horribly trite film and turn it into something that is, if not remarkable, then at least interesting.  The film tries hard to get us to see how Andy has sold out, how she has co-opted her dreams in order to Fit In, but all any intelligent viewer will see is just how fun and exciting Andy's world is once she DOES fit in (and she does it so well).  It's an odd little movie that makes the uncompromising boss seem like the most sympathetic character, while the Family And Friends seem like little more than whiny obstacles, but that doesn't make it bad.

Of course, the ending is to be expected, and it feels as if it's been lifted straight out of a Hallmark card, but the real ending is, like most of the movie, all Streep's.  If Andy is the angel fallen from grace, seduced by a well-dressed demon, then this movie is all about sympathy for the devil.  And even if you can't swallow that, you still get to look at a lot of pretty shoes.",1171238400,4,3333,4.753472222222222

1562360,2,B00005JP0C,"I loved the book when I read it, and was looking forward to buying the DVD. I bought it on the second day of release, and watched it a few days later.

I was disappointed. The start of the film has a couple of montage scenes (good once, but twice?!) and whole chunks of the book are cut out. Meryl Streep playing Miranda Priestly, was so quiet, I kept turning the volume up, but still couldn't hear a word she was saying. It's said Meryl based this on Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry films, but it quite frankly, annoyed the hell out of me.

I don't agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that the film works better without some of the ""duller subplots"" from the book. Andy's best friend Lily featured majorly in the book and even had a pivotal role in the finale. So did Andy's boyfriend and her parents. But they're basically forgotten about, apart from a small glimpse of her father. I liked Lily's story in the film, it showed how strong Andy's friendship was, but she gets no more than a couple of scenes, and a couple of forgettable lines. I don't agree the loss of these scenes made for a more ""streamlined"" film. I actually thought it would have made it better.

The first half of the film sticks quite closely to the book, but leaves out the funny moments. The second half more or less goes it's own way, and I ended up losing it, and not really paying it my full attention. There are still some bits kept from the second half of the book, but not enough.

The finale of the film is changed as well. With Lily's pivotal role forgotten about, it changes completely, and in a very unsatisfactory way too. I much preferred the ending of the book, but I did think it was good the way you saw Miranda at the end.

The only saving grace about this film (apart from Anne Hathaway), was Emily Blunt's scene stealing performance as Emily. She is cattily on target with her portrayal of Emily, a perfect opposite to the wide-eyed innocent of Anne Hathaway. But her storyline gets partly changed as well towards the end, but not in such a major way.

Reviewers calling this a comedy are so far off the mark that it's laughable. What did you find funny apart from Emily Blunt's eye-rolls and her witty comments? There's nothing funny about this. As another reviewer mentioned, it could have so been another Princess Diaries - the transformation from ""I don't care how I look"" to ""Wow, don't I look good?"" is seen right through the film.

If you want to get it, get it cheap, and read the book first. The book is the true gem.",1171152000,,2538,4.375796178343949
1562361,5,B00005JP0C,"This film directed by David Frankel and based on the Lauren Weisberger novel stands out for one reason only, Meryl Streep.  The story is the oft told romantic comedy of someone getting out of college, getting their first real job, throwing themselves completely into it, losing touch with friends and loved ones only to realize in the end what's truly important.  Awwww, how sweet.

However, in this story the young girl just out of college is admirably played by Anne Hathaway, who luck into a job a ""million girls would kill for,"" Miranda Priestly's second assistant.  Meryl Streep plays Preistly, the absolute tyrant that is managing editor of the Runway magazine, the dominant fashion magazine in the world.

It is Meryl Streep's performance in this film that makes it absolutely riveting.  No worse boss could possibly exist in the world, and Streep is phenomenal bringing Priestly to life,  I can't possibly say enough about Meryl Streep in this film, it is amazing to watch an absolute master at work.

Hathaway's preformance as Andy Sachs and that of the other actors, especially Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Emily Blunt as first assitant Emily, and Tracie Thorns as Andy's friend are all solid and first rate, but Streep makes this movie a must see.

Nothing special about the cinematography, except for solid location shots in New York and Paris, but the soundtrack is also exceptionally strong and really fits the movie.

This would be a forgettable film, without Meryl Streep's unforgettable performance.  This movie and Zoolander would make a fantastic double feature of films parodying the fashion industry.",1171065600,,1616,5.060377358490566

Anyway, Streep is riotous. For what it's worth, I've been wearing Prada for years -- mostly for their sombreros and driving moccasins. Way before anyone had to tell me they were genius. I knew it as soon as I saw it.",1170979200,,634,4.651785714285714
1562363,4,B00005JP0C,"I remember reading the novel by Lauren Weisberger and not being very impressed with it.  However, I heard wonderful things about the movie, and so I decided to give it a whirl.  The Devil Wears Prada is one entertaining surprise!  Andrea Sachs(Anne Hathaway) is a young woman who aspires to become a New York journalist.  But before she could do that, she has to settle for an assistant job at Runway magazine.  This is the job that every girl would kill for because it opens doors to many career opportunities.  The women who work there have to be chic, wear clothes no bigger than a size four and devoted fashionistas.  Which is why everyone is surprised when she is hired to be the second assistant to the infamous Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep), editor-in-chief of Runway and a force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry.  Soon Andrea discovers what working for Miranda entails and that there is no pleasing the woman.  Her life is turned upside down and she's on the verge of losing her boyfriend and friends because her life is one-hundred percent devoted to her boss.  On the upside, she gets to wear lots of Chanel and Prada.

I love how fun and entertaining this movie is.  I enjoyed Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, but the one I enjoyed the most was the film's biggest star: fashion.  You get a wonderful backdrop of the fashion industry, fashion designers and the fashion magazine industry that is simply irresistible.  If you're not that into fashion, you will very likely be converted after watching this film (or at least you will become more conscious about the clothes you wear).  The outfits, purses and shoes shown here are beautiful and I wish I could afford to buy more Prada and Marc Jacobs.  I also loved the beautiful scenery of New York City and Paris (where Miranda and Andrea travel for fashion week).  The acting is also wonderful.  I'd seen Hathaway in The Princess Diaries and it was nice to see her in a more grown-up role.  Emily Blunt as the snooty English first assistant and Tucci as the sarcastic fashionista are fun as well.  But the best one without a doubt is Meryl Streep.  She once again proves why she's considered to be one of the best actresses of all time.  Her portrayal of Miranda Priestley is controlled and subtle.  Other actresses would taken the easy route with this role and have Miranda behave like a complete diva who shouts and snaps her fingers at people.  Meryl, however, played Miranda with a quiet confidence and elegant prose that made the character all the more intimidating and hateful.  The character itself is one-dimensional, as she was in the book, but Streep played her beautifully.  I cannot recommend The Devil Wears Prada enough.

That's NOT what I got.  Instead I got a really good understanding of the amazing amount of stress that fashion models have to go through in order to stay fit and be as close to perfect as humanly possible.  Because of this movie, I found out that the life of a fashion model is NOT just a simple cakewalk, and that these models really have to work to be the center of attention in magazines and whatnot.  Having to go through life this way is not as easy as it sounds.  You have to dress correctly, walk correctly, have a perfect smile, etc.  Not easy at all.

Meryl Streep plays an old lady who has the NASTIEST attitude I have ever seen someone have.  She isn't afraid to speak exactly how she feels, and the entire movie is about the main character (Anne Hathaway) having to stay focused and fit in with the world of fashion models in order to be successful at her job (even though she appears to be out of place in that kind of environment).

I suppose this film could only be made in America and specifically in New York.

1562496,3,B00005JP0C,"The old saying, ""clothes make the man"", apparently applies equally to women. (Perhaps it applies more strictly to women, but was never spoken for a lack of need.)

My point being that when Andrea (Anne Hathaway) slips out of her frumpy plaid skirts and bargain bin sweaters and trades up to Jimmy Choo shoes, she becomes a remarkably efficient assistant to Miranda, the devil-in-Prada. No longer does she clumsily fumble her way down Manhattan streets with Starbucks coffees, bags of last-minute requests - no, now she has her hair done, is ""decked out to the nines"" (pun intended) and is one competent gal.

Sorry, but that seemed a bit too Barbie-esque for me. One minute we have Barbie the flight attendant, for example, the next Barbie the CEO. All because of the clothes.

Meryl Streep plays her character with gorgeous understatement - you can almost hear the soft hissing in her voice when she speaks. Anne Hathaway plays an interesting ""Ugly Betty"" character (for indeed, Ugly Betty seems to have used this for much of its inspiration, at least at Mode Magazine). Anne is hardly unattractive, hardly fat - she simply isn't representative of haute couture.

There isn't much of a plot to the movie. It's more of a collection of events taking Andrea from a bungling assistant to a more successful assistant, and everything that you would expect coming along for the ride - a jealous boyfriend, a love interest that seems to appear in the story for one reason alone...that sort of thing.

Yet it's an entertaining film. Streep is a delight to watch, as is Hathaway, especially in the beginning when she was growing accustomed to her co-workers looking askance at her. All-in-all, it was enjoyable and funny - if not great.",1170460800,4,1727,4.840677966101695

For Streep's Miranda character, the job is destiny, the job is everything, leading women across the world to a more beautiful (if anorexic) tomorrow.

  Andi is torn between the seductiveness of Prada and the simple things, like her boyfriend and other friends. Yes, they are simple souls, all young, all trying to climb the ladder of success in the Big Apple.

1562546,4,B00005JP0C,"While the movie is many things that critics have called it (predictable, pat, etc.), it is still worth watching because of Streep's elegant performance. Quick set up: Andy (played by Anne Hathaway), a smart journalism grad trying to make her way in the big city, is jobless and luckless. In desperation, she goes on an interview to Runway magazine, a fashion publication she's barely heard of. Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), a dragonlady workaholic with a penchant for steaks and Starbucks, hires the unlikely girl as her second assistant. The movie then follows Andy and Miranda as their professional relationship continues.

Director David Frankel had better be glad that Miranda is such a primary character in this script, because Streep elevated the material (as she always does). Many other actresses might have played Miranda as a screamer, driven by anger and a perverse pleasure in others' misery. However, Streep makes her real. She is ambitious; she works like a dog; she is exacting; and she expects no less from those who work for her. Because, time and again, the viewer sees how hard Miranda works, it's difficult to write her off as a hate-able character. After all, she doesn't ask her employees to work any harder than she's working herself. As well, I loved the calm, the feeling of business-as-usual that Streep exuded as Miranda. She never raised her voice. She rarely seemed to get emotionally involved in her business decisions. She just did her job. It's a very interesting protrait of a woman at the top in her chosen profession. I can see why Streep made many of the choices she made, and I think she was wonderful in the role.

To boot, there are other, less noble reasons to go see The Devil Wears Prada. First, the clothes and how each character wears them make for fascinating study. Secondly, you'll discover some of the best movies lines ever while watching. (""I'm one stomach flu away from my goal weight,"" mentions one character. ""She's a sadist . . . and not in the good way,"" opines another. And, I think, my favorite - ""Something told me, hire the smart . . . fat girl."") I think it's best viewed with a group of chatty friends, after imbibing something fruity and alcoholic.",1169942400,,2229,4.832460732984293

The chick runs all around town getting Starbucks (yuck), fetching the dryclean, and has all sorts of mishaps in between, and in the end, gets yelled at for not doing things right.  Then she cries and acts like its the end of the world when she should have quit the first day.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.

Meryl Streep was believable and hilarious as the boss from hell.  Anna Hathaway was wonderdul as Andrea Sachs.  Stanley Tucci was superb as the fashion expert and friend to Andrea.  Emily Blunt was great as Emily.  She was snobby towards Andrea but at the end she was jealous of Andrea's new position as Runway.

I can not forget about Simon Baker as Christian Thompson.  He is hot and charming as Andrea's admirer.  He was not too confident, but he was still sexy.  It seemed like he geuninely wanted to help Andrea with her journalism goals but at the same time, he wanted more from her in a intimate way I guess.  I was looking forward to Andrea's and Christian's scenes in the movie.  I was actually rooting for them to get together and hoping that Andrea dumps Nate.  I was hoping to see Andrea and Christian meet again  and connect after the Paris trip.  It did seem like they like each other.

I didn't like how Andrea's friends and boyfriend did not support her and her new job.  If they really cared for her, it would not matter how she dresses or who she works for.  It was her job.

Other than that, it was a great movie.  I can watch it over and over.",1169856000,,1264,4.271186440677966

Her character, Miranda Priestly, will remind everyone of the worst female boss they ever had -- AND the fact that a demanding boss can sometimes prove that you can do the impossible.  Priestly is the kind of tyrant that one finds at the top of super-successful institutions -- crazy, but inarguably driven to seek excellence that others don't care about.

And those of us who agree with Adam Ant that, ""I don't follow fashion ... that'd be a joke,"" will have new appreciation for this industry's demands. Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs grows from a Plain Jane to a beauty while working at Runway magazine -- and learns a lot about her own capabilities. While the superficiality and excess of the fashion world is obvious, there is a kernel of value to the fashionistas' attitude that beauty is worth seeking.",1169769600,,888,4.72258064516129

1562603,5,B00005JP0C,"I loved *The Devil Wears Prada*!  This is one of the few movies that when I watch the first 5 mintues of it, I knew that I was gonna love it.  That's how strong this movie allured you.  That's the way movies are supposed to be.

Set in NYC, ""homely"" Andrea is looking for a job.  She is a law student turned journalist.  Somehow, she landed a job interview with Runway, which is THE fashion magazine that makes or breaks fashion and their respective designers.

Andrea is out of the fashion league.  She's homely looking.  Her hair is simple.  Her clothes are frumpy and easy to notice that they're not of ""top labels"".  She's a regular in-shape girl to many of us.  However, to those in fashion, she's FAT!  Overall, she has no clue in the fashion industry.

Enters the EIC of Runway, Miranda Priestly, who is like a demigoddess of the fashion world.  She is feared by her staff and designers.  She is seemingly rude, superficial, snobbish and spoiled.  However, she has thick skin and does know her stuff.

With sheer luck, Andrea is hired as second assistant to Miranda.  She does all the dirty work such as putting Miranda's coat away, fetching her coffee and many others.  Meanwhile, British first assistant, Emily, is too busy kissing up to Miranda.

Gradually, Andrea works her way up as first assistant.  With the help of the magazine's token gay designer, Nigel, Andrea's fashion improves which also gains Miranda's approval.  She is eventually given the coveted trip to Paris for the exclusive runways of the upcoming fashion.

While she's moving up the ladder, she loses her soul.  She starts to blow her friends away.  She starts to put her work as priority over her boyfriend.  She starts to lose her goals as a journalist.  She starts to be like Miranda.  Miranda confirms that Andrea is a younger version of herself.

The question is will Andrea give up her soul to remain in the fashion world?  Or will she quit the coveted job that ""a million girls would kill for""?

Meryl Streep is at her best in this film.  You must pay close attention to her eyes.  Her eyes emit strong meanings.  She'll glare, command, approve, reject, dismiss and all that with just her eyes.  She had me laughing at some parts.  Other parts, she had me commenting ""oooo, what a b****!""  You either love her or hate her.

Overall, I thought that *The Devil Wears Prada* was a wonderful film.  It's a simple film about moving up in a world that is demanding and determining if it is all worth it.  And if it is...at what cost?",1169596800,2,2515,4.561797752808989
1562604,4,B00005JP0C,"One of the better movies I have watched recently, this film managed to pull off dead serious and uproariously funny at the same time, and most importantly, kept me entertained throughout.

Anne Hathaway is both vulnerably awkward and gorgeous at the same time as she stumbles her way through her employment with the ever-demanding Meryl Streep as her boss.  Stanley Tucci also adds some tragi-comic flair to the mix, and the supporting cast supports without getting in the way.

Ultimately, the film resonated with me well because its underlying theme is work-life balance, an issue with which I struggle on a daily basis.  The gag reel was also amusing, and the deleted scenes contained some interesting material that didn't make the final cut.

The only thing keeping this from getting a resounding 5 stars is pacing.  While I was consistently entertained by the film, the filmmakers could have shaved another 10 minutes from the film and further tightened it without the viewer missing anything.  The most effective sequences are the quick-cut portions showing the day-to-day similarities of Meryl Streep's systematic abuse of power, and in my opinion, several longer sequences could have been similarly intercut as a sort of ""running gag,"" which would have increased the comedic effect and shortened a movie whose premise wears out its welcome slightly before the denouement.

Otherwise, a very entertaining film with a fine cast.",1169596800,,1434,5.177489177489178

1562606,3,B00005JP0C,"Some people live to work.  As the late Frank Sinatra sang, ""If you can make it there [New York], then you can make it anywhere.""  It is on this premise that nice woman, Andrea ""Andie"" Sacks (Anne Hathaway) comes to the Big Apple from the greater Chicago Area in order to make it as a columnist at a major periodical.  After an awkward interview, she lands a big job at fashion magazine 'Runway,'. She has to settle as a receptionist, but really is more of a personal assistant to the leading lady, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), whose every move makes or breaks the fashion industry.  Known as a ""notorious sadist"", Priestly lives to belittle and berate her subordinates.  ""By all means, move at a glacial pace.  That always thrills me,"" Miranda chortles.  She creates great tension, and Andie must act like ""Radar O' Reilly"" with a clairvoyance to forecast every whim of her starchy employer.  We get the point ad nauseam, but there's enough variety in the film to transcend its problems and misery.  Sometimes they beat the idea to death, but the movie takes enough free time to ponder on the estate of things.  There's her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Granier) and their friends who offer a relaxed atmosphere with a comraderie that rises above her fray.  On the other hand, there's the pressure to succeed and temptation from a vain competitor, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker).  The allure of success and a cosmopolitan man have her pondering between two roads.  (One road is the glory of high fashion; the other is down to earth.)  Less compelling is her competitive near superior, Emily (Emily Blunt) who seems to have worked so long for the franchise, she's acquired their bosses' accumen.  Almost implausibly, Andie comes to the defense of despicable people at her own expense.  (Is anyone that nice?)  Another supervisor high on the food chain is Nigel (played with proper bluster by Stanley Tucci), a blunt and fastidious figure who is the only one with enough humanity to eventually warm up to her.  Andie's smart and has a good work ethic, but the movie does a wonderful job presenting and sorting out her priorities.  Like the rest of us, many are tied to their cell phones like an ambilical chord.  Should she sever the ties or not?

'The Devil Wears Prada' is a surprisingly fun movie with a presentation that rises above ordinary sit-com fare.  It also refuses to entirely demonize the enemy.  Andie, to their credit, gains some self-confidence as she succumbs to a fashion make-over.  The villains are also presented with frailties and decency behind their thick skin.  Meryl Streep gives a relaxed prima dona performance; one that also makes us see her believable vulnerability behind her fashion facade.  She seems to walk through the role (although this is only testimony to her brilliance).  Everyone else delivers good, solid performances throughout.  Not giving a fig about fashion, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is an enjoyable and thoughtful release from what I thought would have been an overly labored effort.",1169424000,,3028,4.895874263261296

Meryl Streep does her best to save it but it's just not a good story and nothing much happens. Add a star if you like chick flicks or love Streep in any role.",1169424000,2,426,4.3375

1562692,5,B00005JP0C,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time!! Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actress's and plays the part of Miranda Priestly so very well. The movie tells of a young lady who graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in journalism and moves to the Big Apple in hopes of finding the right editorial job, preferably The New Yorker. After searching with no luck, she finally lands a job as second assistant to the notorious editor in chief of Runway Magazine, Miranda Priestly. She's told almost hourly, ""A million girls would kill for this job,"" but after a few days at Miranda's malicious beck and call, Andy is ready to kill herself. Or Miranda.

If Andrea can hang on for a year in her postion as Miranda's ""dog on a chain"", it will guarantee her a job at just about any publication she chooses, including the New Yorker.

Andrea makes her deal with the devil, suffering through snide suggestions that a size 6 (5-foot-10 Andy's size) is the new 14. Or suffering Miranda's ""it's my fault"" out-loud confession about her new hire, ""I told myself, go ahead. Take a chance on the smart fat girl.""

Miranda's curt ""That's all,"" to signal she's no longer interested in having you anywhere within five feet of her. The office-wide becomes a war-zone when it's reported Miranda is on the premises, as flats are tossed for stiletto heels, uneaten breakfast is tossed in the trash, and panicked cries, ""She's coming!"" are shouted out.

Similar types of stories have been done in the past but in The Devil Wears Prada - the dialogue, story and acting are enough to keep the viewer entertained.

Some things I don't understand are when Andrea's boyfriend confronts Andrea and says he doesn't care if she is pole dancing, as long as she does it with integrity. Is he trying to say any type of a job has integrity but not one where your boss is constantly calling you?

Meryl Streep really lives up to the tag-line ""Hell on heels"". She made this movie as the tyrannical fashion magazine mogul Miranda Priestly.

I fear that she's been type-cast, and she won't be able to shake that label throughout her career.

Her character, Andrea, has a visit from her father, and the only concerns he expresses are (1) whether she has enough money to pay the rent and (2) whether working as an office gofer is worthy of a young woman who turned down a chance to earn a law degree at an ivy league college.  Apparently, daddy is unconcerned about his little girl shacking up with a boyfriend with whom she shares an indefinite future.

There are the predictable effeminate male characters, one of whom guides her through her fashion transformation with all the typical catty comments.  There is the requisite post-makeover montage, followed by the requisite disapproval of her boyfriend & best friend.  I gagged when her boyfriend denied his disapproval of her job on the basis of its low status, explaining that he wouldn't mind if she was a pole dancer, as long as she was a pole dancer with integrity.  ""Pole dancer with integrity"" is apparently the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" for a new generation.

Andrea defends her boss with an absurd feminist rant about how if Amanda were a man, nobody would make such a big deal about her behavior.  I couldn't help but muse that if it was a man treating his employees that way, he'd be hit up with a sexual harassment lawsuit for ""creating a hostile work environment.""

SPOILER WARNING

Other irritations include:

- Andrea burns her bridges at her first real job by abruptly quitting (she merely throws her cell phone into a fountain);

- Andrea & her boyfriend fight, leading to Andrea suggesting they ""take a break"" from each other (whatever that means), and then sleeping with another man whom she believes can help her career;

- Amanda Priestly's husband files for divorce, and she almost-but-doesn't-quite have a moment of regret realizing that her adolescent twin daughters might not adjust so well to Mom's disposable marriages;

- An all's-well-that-ends-well conclusion that includes reconcilliation between Andrea & her boyfriend, Andrea relinquishing her fashionista sensibilities in favor of sensible clothes (but not returning to the frumpy pre-makeover duds), and Andrea getting a great new job due to Amanda Priestly's glowing recommendation (the Devil apparently harbored a secret respect for Andrea).

Girl goes to big city, big city cruel, girl grows apart from friends who serve as proxy family/emotional support base (and noble boyfriend in a respectable but blue-collar profession), glamorous world beckons, internal conflict = is this really who I am?

No, it isn't. You should be teaching nursery school is some forgotten prairie town in the great flyover, the characters of oh-so-NYC spit back at you. A big green-gobby Brooklyn nouveau riche spit.

Szzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

The story actually has a lot pull, as big cities are filled with ambitious inexperienced young women who are used, abused, and amused (and amusing) by their tyrannical bosses. Hera and Minerva could both go on a tear if the virgin daughters of Greece made no obeisance, so that part of the tale isn't fresh either.

So what saves it and merits five stars?

Meryl Streep.

I've loathed lots of roles Ms. Streep has incarnated during the arc of her career of selectively playing ""strong"" women (always remember ""The River Wild"" for you Seven-degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon fans).

Not this time. Meryl Streep delivers a hands down ten star flawless performance in this film. I re-wound every scene she was in and played it again. She is that good.

It is difficult to overstate how flawless this performance is, for it is perfectly balanced. In the hands of another actress, the character Miranda Priestly would have become a cartoon of a Mrs. Danvers. Streep is neither understated and creepy, nor overstated and buffoonish. It is *just*right* and that, perhaps, is the most difficult thing to do when playing a villainess.

Stanley Tucci's performance is also excellent. Easily a five star movie and a great movie for couples.",1168905600,3,1939,4.920245398773006

Meryl Streep is totally hilarious as the over-the-top boss from hell, Miranda Priestly. Anne Hathaway IS cute, but in a well-acted, believable way that makes you want to hug her. It was a pleasure to see Stanley Tucci chew up the scenery, and the fashions, to me, make the movie.

So now I'm ordering this DVD, thrilled to have it. It's the type of movie you can watch with your girlfriends (and the occasional ""sure-of-his-masculinity male"") while it snows outside and you eat all the popcorn and ice cream you promised not to touch.

She was so different in ""Hours"" and the multitude of films she has made.

As mentioned in the film. If she were a male she would be brilliant not a nasty woman.

Being a 30 year product of the ""Corporate Jungle"" and totally relating to her interpretation of the epitome of the power boss.

The other characters were perfect in their roles as will.

What pizazz Meryl did manage to convey only made the other little ingenues seem all the more like high school drama class rejects. There was nothing interesting in this bland, predictable, uninvolving story.
I kept comparing this to the TV show Ugly Betty, which does the sensitive outsider theme so much more creatively ( And with the talented, sparkling actress America Ferrera in the  Anne Hathaway role).

1562882,5,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the familiar story of the innocent in the jungle (business, Wall Street, journalism, fashion,etc.) who achieves success but realizes true values lie elsewhere. Anne Hathaway plays the unstylish, clumsy Andrea who improbably lands a job with Miranda Priestly, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep. Andrea fixes herself up and is smart enough to figure out what Miranda wants, and she finds herself promoted over the senior assistant. In the process, however, Andrea loses boyfriend and friends, as the job becomes all-consuming. In the end, Andrea gives it all up for a ""real"" job in journalism, and wins her long-suffering man back.

The real star here is Streep, who plays Miranda with icy coldness, except for one breathaking scene where she finds out that her husband wants a divorce. The other star is the clothes--sexy, frivolous, sleek and stylish--Hathaway looks great after her makeover. The story is predictable, but no matter--it's totally enjoyable.",1168732800,,985,5.314102564102564

It wasn't really funny, the added plot elements added nothing to the story, and the best thing about the movie was the clothes. It's kind of disappointing how lackluster this film was, especially considering how much it was hyped. It's basically like a cheap Sex and the City without the comedic banter. Meryl Streep was excellent in her portrayal of the Anna Wintour-esque Mirande Priestley, but that alone doesn't make this film worth watching. I'd just wait for it to come on HBO and not waste the money.",1168646400,,585,4.634615384615385

I had not read the book and so kept hoping the film would get better. Can I get a refund from the studio or from Blockbuster? How is it that this film got a circa 75 % positive rating score on Rotten Tomatoes?  It's basically ""The Princess Diaries"" for (so-called) grown-ups. And I doubt any woman will be able to get her man to see a film which gives chick flicks its bad name.

The pretty but very limited Anne Hathaway (who was utterly miscast in ""Brokeback Mountain"") repeats her ugly duckling routine that she did a fairly good job with in ""The Princess Diaries"". Stanley Tucci gets to do a gay snide Vogue editor (Runway!? Come on people!). Emily Blunt (have no idea who she is) is funny???  She was not funny once! The hot Aussie Simon Baker, who was very good and sexy in the somewhat underrated interracial romance ""Something New"" is wasted, but at least we get to see him without his shirt in a Paris hotel room. Anne's cook boyfriend is nice enough, but has a thankless role and I kept wanting to get rid of his Homer Simpson five o'clock shadow/stubbles.

And Meryl, oh Meryl: you don't have to do these movies! I know you're 50 something, but you're Meryl Streep! ""Sophie's Choice"", ""Out of Africa"", ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"",  anyone? Here she just gets to play Vogue's bitch-on-wheels editor-in-chief with a few soft and make up-free moments in Paris. And don't even get me started on her haircut. Oh, and the many many scenes where she tosses her bag and coat on Anne Hathaway's desk: we got it the first three times! Memo to directors: never insult your audience. Was everyone asleep at the wheel?  And are the reviewers here asleep?  Why are we fed these terrible movies and even more importantly: why do we keep going back for more? And the ""writer"" (or ""typist"", to paraphrase Truman Capote) of the book?  She must be laughing all the way to the bank....

Only plus: the killer outfits Anne aka Andrea gets to wear.

Fortunately I also rented a great one to make up for the lousy one: ""Conversation(s) With Other Women"" with Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter. Now there's an intelligent film....",1168646400,13,2252,4.5358024691358025
1562885,5,B00005JP0C,"This is a movie that will basically appeal to most any female even passively interested in fashion or having had to deal too often with nasty female co-workers.  Men who see this film will either do so at the bidding of their female counterpart or have an open mind, which is good so long as they don't take the negative stance of some of the male reviewers who are more suited to comedies like Something About Mary.

Yours truly loved this movie after hearing many different opinions and, best of all, it recaptured the love I used to have for the fashion world when I was a pretty 20-something with a good shape, yet gave me the hindsight to see the humor of it all now that I am neither of those things.  What people of all ages can get out of TDWP is the empathy one can feel for Andy (Anne Hathaway) as she somehow loses her simple, down-to-earth identity in the competitive world of high fashion due to a ruthless boss and cold coworkers who are all obsessed with expensive fashion and it's many designers.  The shallowness of the industry is poked at, but never in a cruel way, but one that makes you respect it while keeping it in a healthy, light perspective.  It's exciting and silly at once, and that's what makes the idea of this film come across so well.

Anne Hathaway is my favorite young actresses after Julia Stiles, and she is just the ticket as the girl-next-door turned tempest bait as Andy with those huge brown eyes.  Adrian Grenier is cute and likeable as her put upon love interest and Emily Blunt is funny and sometimes sympathetic as her coworker who is so stressed and wants it all as she takes Miranda's attacks on her out on the new girl.  Meryl Streep, of course, wins hands down as Cruella DeVille-esque Miranda as she obviously enjoys torturing those in the lower chain of command, yet she also shows a vulnerable side that makes you both respect and sympathize with her.  Stanley Tucci also turns in a great performance as he takes Andy under his wing and becomes her friend.

The fashion is wonderful, the shots of New York spectacular, and the overall feel of the movie is an amusing clash of glamourous stilettos and sensible shoes.  Great subtle humor and a human interest story of being true to yourself when the smoke clears is what it all boils down to.  It's a trip I wouldn't miss, and neither should you.

I guess I can see why the movie would change such an unpleasant character to one we're supposed to root for, but the shift tilts the movie toward the worn-out plot of the girl choosing between Demanding Job and Life.  It could have been any job.  That it happened to be a job in fashion is significant only because it allowed us to see the characters in many beautiful outfits, which is really the only plus in watching the movie.  Other than that, all the usual marks are hit:  girl gives more and more to demanding job, to the chagrin of her ragamuffin buddies; girl excels at job and dismisses whiny boyfriend, who insists he prefers her old, raggedy self; girl goes ""Stockholm"" and begins empathizing with her evil boss/captor; girl has obligatory Who-Am-I? soulful stare into mirror; girl has chance at advancement but tosses it all away to get back to real self.

1562920,5,B00005JP0C,"When Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) lets her hair down with Andrea Sachs (played by Ann Hathaway) in Paris, after she has let Andrea know that Miranda's husband, Steven, does not need to be picked up at the airport since he has decided to sue for divorce, Andrea fully identifying with Miranda's situation (one can see it so well in Ann Hathaway's face, and one should not underestimate Ann Hathaway's performance), asks Miranda, ""Is there anything else I can do?"" Miranda quickly settles back into her normal ""hauteur"" and replies, ""Your job.""

That is exactly what one can say that everyone involved with this film has done. The writer of the screenplay, McKenna (if I remember correctly) has gone farther than the original book by Lauren Weisberger and has given the devil her due. The cutting and editing are simply perfect. The music is admirably chosen and sometimes proves to be a link between one scene and another (e.g., between Andrea's scene with her boyfriend Nate and the quick cut to the Urban Jungle shoot). (It is well worth buying the CD for the music, as I have done as well.) One has to see this movie more than one time and it is well worth doing so. It is easy to notice Meryl Streep's admirable performance at first, but another viewing lets one see the slow but perfect development of Andrea (an everyman -- or everywoman -- a Faustian character, e.g., Emily's comment: ""I knew you sold your soul when you tried on your first pair of Jimmy Choo's."" But Stanley Tucci's (Nigel) and Emily Blunt's (Emily) roles are simply perfect as well. Even the minor characters, Nate and Christian, are really well done, though they are perhaps more ""fifth business"" rather than central characers, even though they are central characters, but somewhat sketchily developed. Nigel's (Tucci), ""[Fashion] It's art, but greater than art, because it's something which you wear on your back -- well, not you, but some people,"" etc. and the comment by the Newspaper Editor at the end of the movie about some snooty girl, such a fun, perfect, snooty girl. One can see her other side when she tells Andrea's successor, ""You have big shoes to fill.""

One can go on and on, one can comment on every scene, every line, but the sum of it is where I began. It is as if Miranda Priestly was in charge of everything and everyone did their job. (If the whole thing was a take on Vogue's Anna Wintour -- or her predecessors, Grace Mirabella or Diana Vreeland -- or her counterparts at other similar publications, like Harper's Bazaar, none of them should feel any objection at all, for in the end, they all did their job, or as Andrea told Christian, (paraphrase) ""If it were a man doing Miranda's job, there would be no criticism.""

I watched the movie in the theater 10 times and on the DVD I watched it again, and then again with the Director's comments and the deleted scenes. The deleted scenes were wonderful, but, yes, they were rightly deleted from the movie itself, to pace it properly (so once again, everyone did their job).

The last time I was so impressed with a film was in 1979 with the movie ""Time after Time,"" starring Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenbergen and about H.G. Well's really having a time machine and coming to 1979 with Jack the Ripper a.k.a., his friend, a Doctor Stevenson. In that movie, there was only one scene (in the bank) which I thought didn't fit, but otherwise, well put together.

It isn't that a movie is (or attempts to be) profound. ""Apocalypse Now"" had profound intentions, trying to apply Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" to the Vietnam War, but it seemed like two movies, poorly connected together. Neither ""Time after Time"" nor ""The Devil Wears Prada"" are profound in their intentions or suppositions, but they are extremely well done. Again, ""everyone did their job.""

And comparing the talents of the author, Weisberger, in her novel to the movie, well, the movie (as is generally agreed)gives ""the devil her due"" and so manages to give greater insight from more than one perspective. On the other hand, Weisberger's conversational fluidity in her writing makes me think of the early Balzac who wrote pot-boilers and the later Balzac, inspired by his sister Laure to perfect his art. Weisberger has real talent, and if she wants to do more than just write best-sellers (which is not to be laughed at), but aspires to be remembered significantly by posterity as a writer, I think she can do it (and she probably has enough money now to be able to have the time and connections to do it, although if she lives in New York City, perhaps several million is not quite enough to feel settled for life without the need to worry about money. After all, what does even a Condo sell for in the Village. But if I say (as others do) that the movie is superior to the book, I want to emphasize that the book shows a real talent (for more than making money) which ought not to be laughed at.

I personally think this is the best movie of the year.",1168473600,3,4970,4.640909090909091

All the cast members fit perfectly in their role, they have excellent on-screen chemistry, and the story flows on a funny and good paced scale.

The movie contains an excellent soundtrack. From the beginning song ""Suddenly I See"" by KT Tunstall, to many classics of Madonna like ""Vogue"" and ""Jump"", they all keep you in an upbeat mode.

The director made an excellent work capturing the escence of the book, and even improving it. For in the book, ""Runway"" editor Miranda Priestly lives with an attitude where it's all about her. In the movie it is more about ""the industry and all she has created"". That is better because it creates more glamour than pretentiousness.

The same thing happens at every job I've ever had, though we tend to eat as many carbs as we want.

I have yet to meet a 20, 30, or 40-something who did not enjoy this film either because of Meryl Streep, the cast in general, the storyline, the fashions, or a bit of each.

After landing a dream job for a famous fashion magazine, she has a fabulous make-over but also sacrifices almost everything else to work for the imperious Miranda Priestly (the devilishly delightful Meryl Streep).  The film is filled with fabulous scene-stealers like Andy's co-workers Emily (Emily Blunt) and Nigel (Stanley Tucci) and some interesting eye candy like Simon Baker and Adrian Grenier.

1562973,3,B00005JP0C,"To begin with, this film is billed as a ""wicked"" comedy but I found no laughs in it. Maybe two or three mild chuckles. All the telegraphed moments that were intended to be comedy were glaringly unoriginal. Virtually every demeaning thing Meryl Streep's character does to Anne Hathaway's has been done in at least two dozen movies in the past 25 years. Only the specifics have been updated. This one simply has the world's greatest actress doing them.

Hathaway was cast because she's not only talented but also gorgeous and not emaciated. She is instantly likeable. Adrian Grenier is bland window-dressing as Hathaway's love interest. Chronic upstager Stanley Tucci is an actor I often can't appreciate but his under-the-top, small doses here keep him from being a liability. Streep is ... Streep! Her deft touch and perfect subtlety keep her absurd character in the realm of possibility. My biggest complaint is that her character's unsubtle hair is distractingly reminiscent of Glenn Close's Cruella Deville in Disney's ""101 Dalmatians.""

The entertaining and engaging parts primarily involve life lessons from the moral ambiguity that rears it head for Hathaway's character. However its lessons are contradictory and all over the map. Much of it is trite and all of it could have been done in a decent LifeTime movie but Streep and Hathaway bring it a level difficult to find on TV. And Hathaway's Andy ends up in a pretty questionable ""happy ending"" that belies her independence.

The film tries it hand at subtle apologetics for the high fashion industry. Even though I didn't buy it, a few of them were food for thought. And it's neat to hear Streep wrap attitude around the word ""cerulean.""",1168041600,8,1697,4.989399293286219
1562974,2,B00005JP0C,"This is a movie billed as a comedy, though it is rarely entertaining, much less funny.  Streep is a brilliant performer, and Tucci makes a stereotype (one of many in the film) tolerable.  It is hard to determine if this is intended as a straightforward comedy with some sort of message, or a message story with some hint of comedy.  Either way, it comes across as a ham-handed story sodden with every kind of platitude imaginable about salt of the earth virtue despoiled by the pernicious effects of vanity and power.  Perhaps if the whole thing had been done as a cartoon it would not be so grating.  By the end of the movie my head was pounding and I wanted all of these cardboard cutout characters with their paint by number lines to just go away.  This may be an interesting film to those who enjoy fantasizing about the world of high fashion, but if that doesn't strike you as interesting, I would not recommend investing time or money in seeing it.",1168041600,4,954,4.485549132947977
1562975,3,B00005JP0C,"I watched this disc on a PS3 on my Mitsubishi 65"" HDTV via Component cable at 1080i.  This is nice looking Blu-ray disc.  I thought the colors were right on and the blacks looks good with no trace of artifacts.  I didn't realized how pasty white Anne Hathaway was, but that is a good thing as it just shows how good a transfer this is.  The audio is good and the music in the shows sounds great, however I found it difficult to hear some of the dialog and found myself asking my wife, ""What did she say?"" several times. As for features, there are some deleted scenes we tried to watch but didn't find interesting.  We liked the gag reel and we really liked the pop up trivia track.  It has all sorts of interesting production notes, trivia, etc.

In all this is a solid release and worth consideration.  I only give it three stars because, this movie is for my wife and if she were writing this it would be 5 stars, but for me that knocks a star off.  Also this MPEG-2 transfer does not stand up the the best VC1 transfers on HD DVD and plus it is an expensive disc, so for me another star off.

I went to see this film last summer when it was in the theatres with my fiancee(now wife).  What caused her to sit at the edge of her seat was not the story or the superb acting but the proliferation of high-end brand names (Gucci, etc.) and the parade of ""Style"" channel celebrities(Valentino? Who?).  It made me feel cheap for giving her a Coach handbag for her birthday.  What elevates this film is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast.  Meryl Streep as a high fashion Cruella De Ville gives a nuanced performance that is the stuff of legend.  Emily Blunt (should be Oscar nominated) follows close behind as Streep's snooty assistant.  The underrated Stanley Tucci as a magazine staffer gives a performance bereft of stereotype.  Anne Hathaway, probably inspired by the talent around her, holds her own with this talented cast.

With its emphasis on the fashion world, it is fun to watch because there is always something interesting to look at.  Most people should enjoy the story because it's a kind of fairy tale gone wrong.  Streep's Miranda does steal the show, giving what could've been a one-dimensional character both the menace of a villain and a softness that doesn't quite let you hate her.",1167955200,,613,4.5963302752293576
1562978,5,B00005JP0C,"This movie is miles better than the silly Ugly Betty program that is a big hit on tv which has a lot of similarities.  Ana, who dreams of being a journalist takes a job out of desperation with Runway Magazine.  Runway is the leading fashion magazine that is the leader in deciding which designers will have successful lines.  The magazine is run by Miranda (Meryl Streep in a vastly different role than the friendly psychologist in the recent Prime) who controls everything about the magazine and whose pursed lips expression can sink a whole fashion line.  Ana interviews with Miranda to be her assistant and has no clue as to who Miranda is (she even tells her so).  What's more Ana appears to have absolutely no clue for fashion (a la Betty) though she does have good looks.

Miranda relegates Ana to running errands with virtually no explanation as to what she wants.  Also, she is plainly told she is the #2 assistant by Emily, who keeps telling Ana not to mess up because she will ruin Emily's chance to go to the big fashion show in Paris (Emily's entire life revolves around being able to go to the show and get all the clothes).  Ana, totally frustrated wants to quit, with great encouragement from her boyfriend.  She is on the verge when she is reluctantly helped out by Miranda's main fashion advisor.  He helps her to make over he look and right away things start to slowly go Ana's way and less Emily's way.

The more Ana starts to suceed, the more she moves further away from her boyfriend, friends, and what she believed in and she starts becoming more like the type of person she always despised.

The movie is highly entertaining and Streep is amazing in her role (way more ruthless than Glenn Close was in 101 Dalmations).  I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1167955200,2,1767,4.571428571428571

The journey begins as a coming of age, Gee, what will I do, angst driven plot typical for the genre but expertly executed and finds the most likeable of characters, Ms. Hathaway's 20ish Andrea Sachs, pitted against the hard driving Miranda Priestly, the editor of a large fashion mag, whom Ms. Streep plays as a careerist with blinders. Her mission is to dictate trends that filter down to even the drabbest of outfits, much like the one Andrea sports during a fitting. Miranda hires Andrea to the great surprise of her other assistant, played with proper comical paranoia by Golden Glober Emily Blunt, who dismisses Andrea as an unfashionable outcast, ill-prepared for the onslaught which is Priestly.

The tide turns, however, and a fable is born when Andrea finds her soul usurped and her choice of career justified by the success she seems to enjoy and the challenges she seems to meet, all to the consternation of her boyfriend and her former wardrobe. The fable turns to involve Andrea's boyfriend and her in house ally played by a suddenly-I'm-gay Stanley Tucci, and we're in for a treat when she and Miranda bare their souls. And there's no funnier scene in a picture this year than Miranda dispensing with her bag and coat in a series of edits that sent me roaring with tears.

An obvious point in its favor is the performance Meryl Streep who is infinitely believable and entirely owns her character. I say this as a person who knows nothing about fashion and nothing about Anna Wintour who may or may not the person Streep's character is a reflection of. Regardless of the veracity of the portrayal, Streep's work is absolutely amazing. With Anne Hathaway, she's an absolute doll for whom most men will find it impossible to turn away. She's quite charming and this contributes significantly to one's enjoyment of the movie. Independently though, I stand for any venture which accurately depicts what it is like to work with women.

Get me the unpublished manuscript of the new Harry Potter book in 4 hours??  Give me a break.  Insist on getting home from Miami when bad storms are preventing all flights?  Absurd.  Two, Streep's performance was grating, irritating, and lousy.  I hated her interpretation of the Miranda role.  Just one false note after another.  A parody, not a performance.  Three, Miranda would NEVER hire Andy - someone with zero experience in fashion - to be her assistant.  Totally unbelievable.  Fourth, nobody would put up with such abuse for more than a couple of weeks.  It's ridiculous to think anyone would subject themselves to it for a WHOLE YEAR.  Fifth, Stanley Tucci's character - so mean and condescending to Andy at first - suddenly makes a 180 degree turn and helps turn her into a fashion goddess?  Again, it would never happen.

1563072,4,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is based on the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger about a young woman's journey of self-discovery through fashion -the clothes and the industry. Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a recent college grad with ambitions for a career in journalism. Having little luck finding a writing position in New York, Andy interviews for a job as 2nd assistant to the editor-in-chief of ""Runway"", a fictional premiere fashion magazine. Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the world's most powerful fashion editor, who holds her staff and her favorite designers in a state of perpetual awe and terror, decides to ""hire the smart fat girl"". So Andy lands the job ""a million girls would kill for"". It seems that the job will kill Andy until she decides to embrace her boss' values and pour herself into it, launching her to professional success and personal turmoil.

""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a bit confused when it advocates embracing one's vocation and its culture without reservation...but then says Andy should stay true to herself and walk away from it all. But that is easy to overlook, because this is such an enjoyable film. It's an homage to the fashion industry in which the city of New York is a sort of overarching character. Meryl Streep is not to be missed as Miranda Priestly, whose incisive, merciless quips inject some black comedy. The stand-out performance comes from Emily Blunt, however, as Miranda's 1st assistant, a fashionista who both envies Andy's success and depends upon it. Stanley Tucci does a nice turn as ""Runway""'s acerbic but sympathetic fashion director Nigel. These people don't mince words! And that's a real pleasure.

""Runway"" magazine is modeled after ""Vogue"", where Lauren Weisberger worked as an assistant to editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, the inspiration for Miranda Priestly. The film's view of fashion editors is accordingly optimistic. The truth is that fashion editors are not at liberty to criticize bad designs, because the design houses pay for the ad space -even if they convince themselves otherwise by frowning on the occasional garment. But ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is an entertaining look at one component of the fashion industry. It respects clothes and the people who create a market for them. It conveys why fashion is important, while it encourages us to laugh at the fashion industry's excesses.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): Bonus features are 5 featurettes, 15 deleted scenes with optional commentary, a Gag Reel (5 min), theatrical trailer, soundtrack promo, and audio commentary. ""The Trip to the Big Screen"" (12 min) discusses the character of Andy and Miranda, finding the right tone, and setting the movie in the fashion world with the film's producer, director, and writer. In ""NYC and Fashion"" (6 min), the cast, director, producer, and costume designer Patricia Field talk about the role of New York in the movie. ""Fashion Visionary Patricia Field"" (9 min) is about the career of designer Patricia Field, including interviews, and how she approached the clothes for this film. ""Getting Valentino"" (3 min) is about luring designer Valentino Garavani to appear in the movie, including a brief interview with him. ""Boss from Hell"" (2 1/2 min) interviews people on the streets about their crazy  bosses. The audio commentary is by director David Frankel, producer Wendy Finerman, costume designer Patricia Field, screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, editor Mark  Livoisi, and cinematographer Florian Ballhaus. They discuss scene-by-scene the film's fashions, locations, what was included or left out and why, the actors, and more. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.

I only wonder why I've never published a book, then had a movie made.  Because this book was so lame, and the movie, so much lamer, that I know I've missed a great secret that's lying out there.

1563076,4,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is an example of how the right talent can help elevate somewhat trite material into an enjoyable and decent film. The script itself is really a very straightforward ""fish out of water"" story of a young aspiring journalist named Andi who takes a job at a high fashion magazine called ""Runway"". In order to survive and adapt, she has to learn to accommodate her ruthless boss, Editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, and an environment full of snotty fashionistas. And, of course, along the way she learns important lessons about what she wants out of life.

Meryl Streep, arguably the greatest film actress ever, chews up the scenery as vicious, powerful, unapologetic Miranda. One scene, in which Miranda is able to destroy a designer's spirits simply by curling her lip subtly at the sight of one of his dresses, is especially telling. However, a lot of credit also belongs to Anne Hathaway. There are few young actresses who could act alongside Meryl Streep without being blown off the screen, but she not only stands her ground but delivers a subtle, charming, comic performance as a smart, yet naive, everygirl facing her first taste of the grownup world.

This movie was much hyped up about from critics and audience ratings, so I decided to give the movie a shot. Andrea, played by Anne Hathaway, acts as a supposedly motivated and determined writer trying to get a break into a publishing career by kissing her boss' rear end, played by Meryl Streep. I thought Meryl's acting was excellent. She portrayed herself as a woman of a keen sense of good fashion who puts her career ahead of her love life, even though her kids are somewhat of a second priority. She pulls off her character really well. During the entire movie I thought ""wow, she's a major bitch. if i were andrea, i'd quit"".

Andrea's character is average, the only worth seeing was when she dressed well to try to impress her boss. Other than that, her acting is no different than all her other movies.

1563121,3,B00005JP0C,"Based on Lauren Weisenberg's book from 2003, The Devil Wears Prada is a fairly good film that follows a naive young woman on her journey from a small town to New York City where she gets hired to work for a popular fashion magazine. This movie is one of a handful of films directed by David Frankel- a man best known for his directorial involvement in various television series and in a few films.

The Devil Wears Prada has many of the cliches one would expect in a film that follows an unoriginal plot but it also offers some interesting twists and some excellent performances. The story of a naive small town girl who moves to New York in search of a big career is an old theme for a movie but Devil Wears Prada succeeds more often than it doesn't and it turns out to be an acceptable film.

A large part of this movie is spent dealing with Meryl Streep's Miranda character; detailing her ruthless, uncaring persona as she verbally degrades her workers and has everyone around her walking on eggshells. I found myself enthralled with Streep more than anyone else in the film because once again, she excels in every possible way. Like always, Streep is excellent in this role and she is the main reason I recommend watching this movie. Her Miranda character is cold, insensitive, and arrogant, but not as completely obnoxious as she could be. Miranda never raises her voice and often expresses herself very effectively without saying a word. Streep deserves all the credit for making this character so enjoyable to watch and she, alone, makes the movie worth viewing.

All of the other performers are very good in this film, including Anne Hathaway in the lead role, Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt, and others. It was interesting to watch Hathaway's character as she stumbles into this job with a fashion magazine, hoping to use it as a stepping stone to a career in journalism. She changes many things about herself simply to please those around her in the business and ultimately sacrifices much of her personal life. This is the type of situation I cannot personally relate to, but I can think of several individuals who have walked down this same treacherous road, expecting great things in the professional sense but giving up their own personal identity in the process.

Where Devil Wears Prada falls short is with the screenplay and the lack of deeper examination of the fashion and publishing industries. A great motion picture could be made about a subject like this but David Frankel decides to keep Devil Wears Prada on the simple side. The movie does a good job with its cross examination of that sensitive area where personal lives and business lives cross each other but it doesn't go far enough to be considered a classic film.

Overall, Devil Wears Prada is a good movie with some funny moments but mostly a serious message about work and play. The movie reminds me in some ways of the hit series Sex in the City (David Frankel directed some of the Sex in the City shows) and it succeeds mostly because of the performances- especially that of Hollywood veteran Meryl Streep. Take Meryl Streep out of this picture and you would have another second- rate run of the mill movie destined for ever growing Hollywood bin of mediocrity. But with Streep performing so well and the rest of the cast contributing very good performances as well, Devil Wears Prada turns out to be a good enough film to recommend.",1167091200,2,3415,4.69449081803005
1563122,5,B00005JP0C,"As a fashionista myself, I absolutely adore this movie. I got it on DVD for Christmas and I am very happy with it. It's witty, funny and the characters are so enjoyable. This is a movie that even a straight man could enjoy. It's not your typical chick flick. A lot of people could relate to this! Struggling and breaking your back to move up in the world, even when no one thinks you can do it and the odds are against you and it feels almost impossible. You can't help but be happy for Andrea as she succeeds and proves her naysayers wrong by becoming a confident and stylish woman. Many people would say that she lets her job consume her and alienates her friends and family, but honestly, I feel that her friend Lily and her boyfriend, Nate were being unsupportive and not understanding. Such as shown in the scene where they play keep-away with her phone when Miranda calls her, C'mon! If my boss is calling and someone takes away my phone, I'd go off! It's very difficult for her and there's a lot of pressure on her to succeed and it seemed as if her friends and boyfriend were a little threatened by her success and the fact that she looked fabulous. She looked great and she was doing great at her job, and her friends couldn't even be happy for her. She should've gotten some new ones. Her friend Doug, on the other hand, seemed to love her new job! Nate was being whiney, selfish and threatened. Merryl was absolutely amazing and oscar-worthy as Miranda! From the minute she walks out of the elevator, she exudes cruelty! Stanley Tucci, as Nigel, is a riot! Clever, funny and witty! Simon Baker is sexy and irrestible as Andies admirer. The Devil Wears Prada is definitely a must-see, especially for those who love fashion. This movie drips with cotoure!",1167004800,2,1764,4.498442367601246
1563123,4,B00005JP0C,"Ever rent a movie simply because nothing came out that week? I decided to check this out simply because there was nothing else I haven't seen and I'm not a guy that shys around from ""chick flicks"", well obvious ones anyway. I remember it was just sitting on my counter as I watched other movies but then I thought I'm going to have to watch this sooner or later so I popped it in and surprisingly, while it does have some minor faults, I was actually surprised that it wasn't terrible but it was actually...good?

It's a cutthroat world in the fashion industry where people are essentially worried about wearing the right clothes, being skinny and caring about material things. This of course makes Andy, (nickname for Andrea so it's not a guy), a smart but inexperienced and a size-6, a fish out of water at a fashion magazine, headed by Miranda Priestley, a nasty brutally honest woman, or just plain brutal. Andy needs the job to get ahead with her career so she has to suck it up and track down everything Miranda asks including skirts she didn't specify as to what kind, an unpublished Harry Potter book and knowing how to drop off things at her house without any problems.

I remember working at a radio station where I was essentially tasked to do a few tasks that required a lot of time to finish them properly which of course meant by myself and not having any assistance or deadline extensions. Like Andy, I felt like way too much for just one person so I actually did started to feel sympathy but only thing was Anne Hathaway didn't really feel completely stressed out but more annoyed than anything. Whether it was bad casting or direction, I don't know. Of course the scene-stealer is Meryl Streep who plays probably the meanest thing I've seen. The other cast members are fine in their roles but in terms of characters, Andy's friends seem a bit underdeveloped. We're meant to see the job strain carry over with them but it doesn't feel as it should be.

Ultimately though the film's about people's obsession and with that we get a look into people obsessing on clothing and must say, despite Anne's Hathaway's slightly ok performance, she looks quite radiant in the various dresses, including some shots where she switches dresses thanks to directing and editing and it's a good use of it. I find it hard though to accept Andy's reluctance to be Miranda's assistant since it's just simply her way of going about things. Miranda isn't really a devil so much as really difficult so despite my radio station similarity, my case and Andy's were simply unfair but a case of ""that's the way the world works"" so it was hard for me to feel empathy on that but just a I-know-how-you-feel thing.

Unlike some chick flicks where it just oozes with cliche and bad comedic writing like people all of a sudden tripping or banging their heads, Prada feels more like the smart-women's comedy, it goes more for situation comedy rather than a go-for-broke approach. While the story is fairly predictable, it's at least an enjoyable romp that you might forget as easily as the latest trend.

It did not necessarily touch the heart strings as it seemed to strive for at times, however, Meryl Streep's character stayed true the entire film.

1563167,5,B00005JP0C,"Andrea (Anne Hathaway) is an attractive, but plainly-presented wanna-be journalist who applies for a job at a magazine to bide time until she can make a ""real"" career move. Oh, but the magazine is Runway, a fashion magazine, and despite her initial resistance to change her plain-clothes, intellectual demeanor, Andrea soon faces a choice: be casual and be treated casually (and cruelly!), or be the best employee she can be in the environment in which she finds herself...in order to be treated as the competent individual she claims to be. This challenge is too much for Andrea to resist, even though it takes her further and further from the goals she was pursuing and the people important to her life.

Andrea's job is as Assistant Two, replacing stressed-out Emily (Emily Blunt), who has just been promoted to Assistant One, and whose dream will soon arrive: she will accompany The Big Boss to Paris, where she will get wonderful clothing. In anticipation of the new clothing, Emily's food program consists of waiting until she's about to faint, then eating a piece of cheese.

The Big Boss is Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), nicknamed ""Dragon Lady"" and accused, rightfully so, of putting her career entirely above and over her personal life, expecting nothing less of her scampering, nervous assistants.

Stanley Tucci's character helps Andrea into better clothing. He is aware of Andrea's lukewarm attitude toward the Runway vision, and is one of many characters to remind her, ""Millions of women would DIE for this job."" My favorite dialogue between the two:

(Song CRAZY that Seal did years ago runs beneath - whoever is doing this version is doing good credit!)

Andrea: My personal life is hanging by a thread, that's all.

Tucci's: Well, join the club. That's what happens when you start doing well at work, darling. Let me know when your whole life goes up in smoke. That means it's time for a promotion.""

1563168,3,B00005JP0C,"Overall, The Devil Wears Prada is a pretty solid, fairly forgetable movie. The entire cast really shines, but none as bright as Meryl Streep. She could have come off as a caricature Cruella Da Ville-ish archetype, but instead she's created a very real portrayal of a success-driven business woman who's devoted her life to her work.

I was surprised at how little actually happened in the movie. At several points throughout the film I felt sure that something was about to happen, some event about to occur... but that never really happened. Although the plot does seem to move at a glacial pace, the imagery (New York streets and skylines), script, and acting really hold their own and keep an unveventful movie from becoming boring. In fact, it's quite enjoyable.

Parts of the story are a bit contrived, and in a lower-budget movie they would have seemed laughable, but willing suspension of disbelief comes in handy here. If you enjoy fashion and scenes where the ""other girls"" drop their jaws because they're so impressed with Anne Hathaway's makeover, you will LOVE this movie. If you're not really into that stuff, you'll still enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, you just won't want to buy it, take it home, and wear it.",1166745600,4,1222,4.814285714285714

I personally thought the producers of this movie completely butchered the story! I love Anne Hathaway but she was completely wrong for this role. Andy really needed to be someone much more smart and savvy and with a slight attitude, as opposed to confused, wide-eyed Anne. As a matter of fact, not one person in the entire cast (aside from Streep of course) was portrayed properly and in line with the book. What is the point of making a movie out of a book if you are going to completely change the story and fail to thoroughly develop any of the characters? I hated the adjustments made to the story and was decidedly angry that the writers chose to have Andy sleep with Christian (who, by the way, going back to the casting problem, should have been someone much younger, cuter and not a complete doofas). For what it was, a pretty good movie and entertaining to watch but speaking from the perspective of someone who read the book first (bad idea), this was a horrible rendition and a supreme disappointment.",1166659200,4,1135,4.541463414634146

I have to say, out of the ones I watched, this movie has made the most interesting choices so far.  It feels lighter without the tough choices and the tragic accident which Andy has to face. Story plots were switched; personalities of charactors were adjusted.  These changes made this movie fun and more suitable for a popcorn night.

Meryl Streep gave a glowing performance as the ""devil"".  The charactor in the book is truly a much worse person and boss.  I don't like Andy's friends and boyfriend in this movie either.  They could've been made less judgemental and more understanding without making Andy and her whole career too inhuman.

And tolled me I was her best assistant who could handle her. She even asked me to stay but I thanked her for the experience she gave me and it always reminds me of not to be that kind of boss.

Ultimately, it's just an entertaining, fluffy little story, and anyone who has a remote interest in fashion will find this even more alluring.

Meryl Streep embodies the role as fashion editor Miranda Priestly, and manages to give the character a certain degree of likeability. The same is true for Emily Blunt, who plays the neurotic first assistant to Miranda. I had no problem sharing this with my young daughters, believing it gave them a glimpse into what it might be like to work for a difficult boss--not a unique scenario for young women fresh out of university.

1563176,4,B00005JP0C,"Chick-book writer Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel comes to fast-paced life in the 2006 film adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada....Rest assured, a movie that is no chick-flick. While some of the fast-paced-ness seems over the top, as a veteran that's worked in the publishing business in NYC, I can say first hand that it is not over the top...for the most part.

And the completely obtuse disposition that defines Meryl Streep's character, while perhaps a bit exaggerated at times, is universally known in the industry as the standard by which you should set your expectations for a boss if you are going to work at any of the big firms that publish the fat fashion and beauty magazines. I'd bet that Weisberger, quite contrary to the disclaimer that ""this book/movie is a work of fiction"", was loosely (or not so loosely) based on a real publisher.

Some of the dialogue and situations do indeed stretch the limits of reality, but no more than that of the humorous bits commonly found in shows like HBO's Sex and the City or Entourage. And no wonder...Director David Frankel has made his mark on both of those as a director.

Overall, I was completely entertained. I don't know if it's the title using the word ""Prada"" or if it's some whisper down the line miscommunication that's incorrectly given The Devil Wears Prada the official chick-flick label among the guy community...perhaps cheating this movie out of a much higher dollar gross.

Maybe it's a guy mentality thing? Yesterday I told my buddy about how much I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada. I told him it's a good story; it moves quickly; you can relate to the situations; and the acting is excellent. He said, ""Does Anne Hathaway get naked?"" Um...no. It's just a very good movie.

So my recommendation, guys, see it. But if you were one of the naysayers, be warned: You will need to go back to everyone and confess that you got your butt kicked by a chick-flick.",1166400000,5,1923,4.711309523809524
1563207,4,B00005JP0C,"Ok, I know what Prada is...sort of.  I couldn't pick one out of a line up to save my life but I know it's a fashion line...of shoes, or purses or something.  In any case, I watched this film with my wife because it looked entertaining.  I'm a movie buff and Anne Hathaway is not only cute but she's a talented force coming up through the ranks of Hollywood.  After seeing her in Brokeback mountain, I wanted to see what else she was in (besides the Disney Princess flicks).

I was not disappointed.  She gives a great performance as Andrea Sachs, a straight forward girl from the mid-west who applies for a position as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the Satanesque Editor in Chief of Runway, a fashion magazine of Godzilla like proportions.  She aspires to be a journalist, not a fashion editor, so she is shocked to find that it's a dream job for many and that if she can hold out for a year she can work anywhere she wants.

The unfolding of the film's message is subtle, showing how when one gets ahead in the business they thereby loose everything else in their life, arguably including their soul.  As she starts out snubbing the industry, she soon learns she has to integrate herself in order to make it work (when in Rome...).  Things start to fall apart in her personal life though; her friends loose interest, her boyfriend complains she isn't around anymore and they have nothing in common.  This is done without them becoming unreasonable jerks as well.

As for the other performers; Streep runs away with the movie in whatever scene she's in.  Her low key and delicate approach to the character instead of being a high volume demanding taskmaster is brilliant.  Anyone can be a screaming bitch, but Streep puts class in her strut and her dialogue showing why she is one America's premier actresses.  She's a blast to watch but you want to kill her at the same time.

Other notable performances include Emily Blunt as the first assistant, Simon Baker as the journalist who may help Andy get her foot in the journalism door and most especially Stanley Tucci, brilliantly playing Miranda's right hand man and lead fashion expert.

The movie is very entertaining and a good story that is very relatable to most.  It is thankfully NOT about fashion, or it would have lost me five minutes into the movie.",1166400000,2,2332,4.632603406326034

Meryl Streep was terrific, though she was allowed to show a soft side a few times, which took away from the ""bite"" that may have been implied by the title. (I had a boss like that, but mine was meaner and showed less sensitivity). Streep is not the main character, however, and Anne Hathaway shows command in the central role. There's excellent support from Adrian Grenier, Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt. The shots of New York City (and of Paris) are grand and impressive, and, as one would expect, the costume designs are stunning, though few are original for this film.

This is a well made if slightly corny (especially the less-than-satisfying ending) tale of self-discovery. The acting is top notch with Anne Hathaway being the weakest link. Her character has little to convey emotionally and she does a fair job of just that, but the other three major characters at Runway magazine are worth the price of admission. They save what might've been a cliche and turn it into a fun exploration of the world of fashion. Granted, some deep ideas (the double standard applied to powerful women, chosing between career and love) are glossed over, remember it is a fluffy movie based on a fluffy novel, so approach it as such.

I agree with the general sentiment that (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Andrea should have blown off her painfully immature friends and gone for rhe gold, having the foresight to know that her relationship with the boyfriend wasn't going anywhere anyway, but she gives in to the picket fence and Hallmark duldrums instead of seizing the brass ring when it is so clearly within her view, but this is overanalysis where it is clearly not called for.

I loved how it took the character of Andrea and transformed her from a whiny brat to into a strong, confident woman who truly wants to work and do a good job, no matter how difficult Miranda is as boss.  Of course Meryl Streep turns Miranda from a hellcat witch to a strong, tough woman in charge who will not take no or cannot be done for an answer.  The screenwriters turned the witchy side of Miranda and placed it in the character of Emily, wonderfully played by Emily Blunt.

I strongly suggest that if you read the book and hated Andy, watch the movie and see how she should be.  If you read the book and loved Andy, you may not like how she is portrayed in the movie.

1563264,4,B00005JP0C,"There are only three things wrong with the title of this review for the film ""The Devil Wears Prada.""  First, Anne Hathaway is an actress who plays the character of Andy Sachs, but I keep thinking of her as Anne Hathaway as in ""Now that Anne Hathaway has done sex scenes to get away from the whole Disney-Princess bit she is heading back in that direction in this film"" instead of as her character.  Second, it was grade Flavor-Aid and not Kool-Aid that was mixed with cyanide and Valium at the order of Jim Jones in Jonestown (and no one who drank it survived) but since the phrase ""drink the Kool-aid"" has become part of the vernacular once again historical facts have to take a back seat.  Third, haute couture is used loosely to refer to all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing, but in France is now a protected name that can only be used by French fashion firms that meet well-defined standards.  This time I will embrace the vernacular and my contradictory position on such things.

I used this flawed title for my review because for me it defines the pivotal moment in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" that establishes both the film's major strength and its ultimate flaw.  Andy Sachs wants to be a journalist but ends up as the second assistant for Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of ""Runway"" magazine (think of something beyond ""Vogue"") because maybe a smart ""fat"" girl can work where so many skinny well-dressed girls have not.  Andy is fresh from the Midwest and has a level head on her shoulder, so she knows, as do we the audience, that Miranda and everybody else at ""Runway"" are pretentious, elitist snobs.  Nigel (Stanley Tucci) is nice, but everybody else follows the lead of Emily (Emily Blunt) and treats Andy as somebody from another planet where nobody dresses well because they buy off the rack.  Taking notes during a meeting that has descended to the question of which belt would be the proper accessory, Andy snickers.  Miranda casts a withering stare at Andy and then proceeds to explain why the sweater Andy is wearing is a direct result of a similar decision made by the people in that room a few years earlier.

That is the point where Andy does the Kool-aid drinking, and it was the point at which this film version of the novel by Lauren Weisberger starts to get away from being totally predictable.  When screenwriter Aline Brosh McKennna (""Laws of Attraction"") and director Peter Howitt (""Sliding Doors"") take the fashion business more seriously, which is to say when Andy starts to take it more seriously, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" gains considerably more weight.  Everytime we get back to Andy's boy friend Nate (Adrian Grenier), best friend Lily (Tracie Thoms), and fourth wheel Doug (Rich Sommer), things are a lot less interesting than when she is at the office.  Her job is clearly demanding and her friends take issue with the fact that it might possibly be considered rewarding.  However, I was interested in the idea that Andy would find her niche rather than lose her soul working for Miranda.  Unfortunately, in the end we get back to the predictable path the film laid out in the beginning and the mantra that no job is more important than family and/or friends.  The problem is I do not accept that premise, thinking of plenty of jobs (e.g., teaching) that require you to put the job first (I think of Leo McCary in Season 1 of ""The West Wing"" telling his wife that the job he is doing is more important than his family at that point of time; Leo's wife left him, but I have always believed he was right).

The net result is that despite another great performance from Streep, Tucci having some fun, and what should be a breakout role for Blunt, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" ends up being nothing more than what it promised to be from the beginning.  I might have liked this 2006 film more without my favorite scene, because at that point I was thinking the film was more ambitious than it turned out to be.  I know that the film is probably just being faithful to how the novel ends, but I definitely liked the movie I thought they were making more than the one they were actually making.  At the very least I would have liked to see them walk the tightrope a bit longer, so that the idea Miranda's world was worth living in could be maintained in the last half of the film.  But the whole ""Hell on Heels"" bit proves too seductive and if Streep sets up another Oscar nomination by refusing to let her character descend into caricature, the same cannot be said by Hathaway's Andy and this anti-princess cautionary tale.",1166054400,3,4565,4.616810877626699

The book was  a fun, quick read, and the movie is fun, but the story light and meandering, like the book..Hathaway does not get in the way and she's good in the role, the movies cameo's are good as well, but again its Streep, that makes this movie.",1166054400,3,511,4.09

1563267,5,B00005JP0C,"Here goes. Call me a wimp. I don't usually indulge in chick flicks, but for my wife's sake I sat down for this movie--and found myself totally sucked into it.

From the pitch-perfect opening scenes of Andrea Sachs facing her potential boss, to the final showdown, we are dragged along with Andie into a world of vicious high fashion. Her journey is our journey, wondering why this is all so important, slowly coming to appreciate it, then realizing the seduction of its beauty and glamour. Some have complained that the situations she faces are contrived and no-win scenarios. While yes, they are set up to advance the story, they are scenes in which Andie could've faced down her boss. Instead, she sold her soul.

This is a witty film, sharp as a pitchfork, that has much to say but leaves most of it up to the viewers to figure out. The screenplay and direction are superb, but it's the acting that makes this thing sparkle. Hathaway (mostly believable as a frumpy wannabe journalist...she can't quite hide her natural beauty) shifts from frump to diva in convincing fashion, while never totally losing her heart of gold. Streep shifts from devil to somewhat sympathetic overlord, while never stepping too far from the dark side. Along the way, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are great counterparts, providing humor and heart.

In the end, Andie's decision to chase her dreams or chase the career that ""a million girls would kill for"" propels this very likeable comedy into a story with sly wisdom running underneath. What a great film.",1166054400,3,1538,4.818181818181818

Does that really show that the protaganist is circling the drain? What is she supposed to choose? Is Hollywood insane? The self-righteous friends and requisite token minorities are also included. Except for the Asian contingent. They need to complain more, I suppose.

But it's an otherwise entertaining look at the world of fashion and fashion publishing, with Streep as a driven taskmaster whose every whim is catered to. This she plays to perfection. Stanley Tucci is endearing as the mentor figure. And the part of the ""number one"" aide is played to comedic perfection, especially a hilarious head-shaking response.",1165968000,3,833,5.17037037037037
1563269,5,B00005JP0C,"Okay, I read the other reviews here. And... quite honestly I think some people are missing the point to this story.

This is really the story of Andrea and how she learned what it sometimes takes in this world to move on and up. There are those things we strive toward in life and along the way others have to be discarded. Simple fact of life.

Meryl Streep is exquisite as the consummate bitch (as good a job as in 'The Manchurian Candidate' but with a twist). The acting, filming, story and music all come together in this one.

Meryl senses something in Andrea which is revealed toward the end of the film. She takes her on and teaches her what it takes in the industry to get to where she got.

When Andrea finally realizes her 'job' was actually a lesson and what that lesson was, she walks away from it. But she has gained more insight into herself and discovered what she felt she could never do... she had already done. The name of the game is survival.

On the surface this is a well played out dromedy. But it does have a deeper message and all the characters in the movie are easily identified with.

Saving going into detail here..... forget the movie is about the fashion industry and watch it. There are life lessons, albeit tough ones, taught here. Watch the interactions and growth in the group of characters and you will be nicely suprised.

I don't believe any other movie has played this theme out as well, and as cleverly as this one.

1563271,5,B00005JP0C,"Yes, we have seen the storyline before.  So What??  Almost every movie Hollywood has been making in the last 20 years are ""new"" versions of old storylines.  But this is an enjoyable film, and I think the director did a great job.  ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions.""  Isn't it easy to fall into the trap?  Andy, of good intentions, does what every job seeker does: to please the boss.  And yet the road to success is never easy, and one minute you think you know yourself and your choices, yet somehow, without any meaning to, you find yourself on a completely different path than the one you started out with.

Some of you have bosses that are easy to please.  I have met and worked with bosses like Miranda Priestly, and it's true, there are people like that in the world.  Meryl Streep did a fantastic job of conveying such a tyrannical boss.

And Anne Hatheway is beautiful.  Audrey Hepburn will never be replaced. But among the stars of today, Anne Hathaway is MILES ABOVE stars like J. Lo, Britney Spears, and all those stars who think they are stars, but are nothing but crap.

Anne Hathaway is a much better role model than Britney Spears or J. Lo, Anne is definitely elegant, refined, and a lady.  And we need more actresses who portray good manners, good breeding and good education.

Just because the way the ending is not a bang, doesn't mean it's a bad movie.  Every time when we make a right decision, there won't be fireworks going off, or large celebrations to tell us we are right, and I think a lot of people are confused about that.  They think that's what the movies should always provide.

In real life, assistants cannot afford to dress like Anne did in the movies.  But we are in a movie.  So just enjoy it for what it is.  A great movie that reminds us: choose the real important things in life vs. choose the frivolous things in life like fame, fashion and glamour, which fades in an instant.",1165449600,17,1931,4.4289772727272725

While the movie is different from the book, it is still pretty good. Andrea is from a small town and is a family girl who has never experienced the corporate world and especially the self-important people who go along with it.  She quickly learns to speak only when spoken to and to make her job her life if she wants to get anywhere.  She does it so profoundly that all the girls who made fun of her in the beginning are envying her in the end.  I loved the movie mostly because I can relate to Andrea because I too had the boss from hell...it was pretty scary how in certain parts her boss reminded me of mine to the T!

1563341,4,B00005JP0C,"This movie is fun and entertaining, and a big chunk of that is provided by Meryl Streep. The role of Miranda sounds like a job for Central Casting: a heartless villianess who is part Diane Sawyer and part Cruella de Ville. Streep takes this role and imbues it with astonishing shades and color while never losing sight of Miranda's uncompromising steeliness. There is a scene in the movie in which Streep merely LOOKS at another character, and that look says more than a monologue could. There is also a fantastic speech Miranda gives Andie that is already a bit of a classic.

The movie benefits from many supporting performances, including Stanley Tucci in a wonderful, endearing role. The weakness of the film was in the casting of, and performance of, Anne Hathaway. Hathaway is certainly talented, but is miscast here, and her performance is languid where it should be harried, and disaffected where it should be transfixed. That's why the movie is ""good"" instead of ""great"" - a more aptly cast sparring partner would have given Streep and Tucci far more fire to play against.",1164931200,2,1081,4.8432432432432435

Congratulations to David Frankel for bringing us a gemstone of eloquent entertainment that has, in recent years, been severely lacking on screen. Everything; script, casting, set design, cinematography, score, and of course the acting, is first rate and exceptional. A comedy-drama that sparkles with reality but never takes itself too seriously.

  Meryl Streep is a super b...h. Not a mistake at birth. She just likes it that way.

  Anne Hathaway is the proverbial innocent. Stupid...like a fox, and in more ways than one.

  Stanley Tucci? An actor who never looses his touch but simply improves with age.

  Emily Blunt is just that...blunt and hilarious.

  It seems to be the honor bound duty of every reviewer to find some fault or flaw and sanctify his critique status. Oh well.

The movie is in a way predictable, but you find yourself liking and sympathizing with ""the Devil"" due to the immense talent Ms. Streep employs to bring the character to life on the screen.  Also notable is the performance rendered by Stanley Tucci as Nigel (vs his villainous role in Terminal) - a good solid portrayal of a loyal second that never questions, never complains in a way that humanizes the woman who employs him.

But I was in for a shock when i saw 'Devil wears Prada'. With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Meryl Streep's Miranda motivates both terror and a measure of admiration. No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace. Anne Hathway was like fresh breeze of Air...

1563346,3,B00005JP0C,"The title of the film (based on the bestselling novel which I have not read) refers to a New York fashion magazine editor named Miranda Priestly. This devil, I mean, Miranda, is played by Meryl Streep who is in top form, bringing the film itself one or two notches above other Hollywood comedies. Whether or not you like her dragon-lady character, you will be impresses with her turn, one of her best in a decade. or maybe two.

I must add that Anne Hathaway is also very good as Andy, a nave career girl in New York who scored a job as the second assistant to Miranda. For Andy it as only a stepping stone to be a journalist, but while doing the thankless jobs for Miranda, she is gradually attracted to the world which she initially despised.

Miranda never misses a chance to reveal her (perversely) cynical view on everything which she dislikes, and the way she makes her acid comments on them has a certain kind of unforgettable taste that is either repulsive or irresistible, or both. The sado-masochistic relations between her and Andy keeps you interested in the film's otherwise predictable story, even though anyone with level-headed mind (like Andy) would not usually turn down the opportunity to learn at a first-rate law school in order to be ill-treated by Miranda. As Stanley Tucci's fashion director says, why not quit?

In spite of superb acting from Streep and Hathaway, and the critical praises heaped on the film, I find `The Devil Wears Prada' left much to be desired. The script is almost auto-pilot when the main characters do not share the screen. In fact the career success of Andy (if I may call her `success' that way) owes much to incredible luck; she is lucky to have a capable fashion director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) at hand when she wants it, and an entire wardrobe for them to use for that matter; she is lucky to know a writer working for another prestigious New York magazine Christian (Simon Baker) who can help her out when Miranda asks Andy to obtain something very rare (actually, no one but J. K. Rowling can). There is something cosy and (if I may so) superficial about the film's attitudes to the works Andy is trying to do, something that prevents the film from becoming a really biting comedy that it could have been.

There is one impressive scene showing why Meryl Streep is a great actress who is not afraid of being truly in character. I do not say when and how she shows it because it is the only surprise I got while watching `The Devil Wears Prada.' The film is enjoyable with the great performances of the two leads, the beautiful locations of the city and the fashionable costumes, but it could still have been better with just something more than another take of success story, and some more scenes looking under the surface of the people working for this fashion industry.",1164067200,5,2825,4.621513944223108

1563426,4,B00005JP0C,"This is a very entertaining film that explores many of the situations that young adults must master on their way to understanding themselves and their goals in life.  Primarily this means how to balance work demands and the demands of family and friends. I personally think that the years following college graduation and the first successes and failures in business help a young adult clarify their values and the path or direction they wish to take their life. In this regard, The Devil Wears Prada, is right on the money.

Anne Hathaway does a great job playing recent college graduate, Andrea, who takes a job as second assistant to a highly demanding supervisor. Meryl Streep, as editor Miranda Priestly, does a superb job of playing a driven, workaholic, creative power-broker in the fashion industry. Strep's performance was captivating yet not 'over the top'. She never was a cartoon witch, just incredibly demanding and self absorbed. The fact that Meryl Streep can take a character that is totally unique and bring out the vulnerable human qualities attests to her superior acting skills. Watching Streep play the Machiavellian diva is worth the price of the DVD.

So what happens to little innocent Andrea? She gradually takes the challenge of trying to please the totally unpleasable Miranda. She gradually masters her job and the field of fashion. She also gradually begins to edge out first assistant, Emily Blunt. Blunt is also superb as she trys to imitate her hateful boss, yet always a softer side comes through. Handsome Daniel Sunjata plays a young designer, dependent on Miranda's good graces and opionion. He is willing to change an entire line of his designs to please her.

Simon Baker as a jet set journalist, Stanley Tucci as Miranda's second in command, and Adrian Grenier as Anne's college boy friend, Nate, all allow Andrea to see herself as other see her and as she is gradually becoming. Andrea is almost lost, until she discovers that Miranda's position is in jeapardy, and she comes to the loyal defense of a woman most folks consider to be a monster. But Miranda was already aware of the coup, and is willing to double cross her second in command to remain in power. Andrea gets a glimps into the driven inside dynamics of Miranda and at some point realizes she doesn't want this future - even if she may have the instict and brains for such a world. In the end, Andrea makes the right moves, she does not fall for the chaos and competition, and gets her life and love back.

Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that ""Devil"" provides.

1563429,5,B00005JP0C,"My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.

First is Anne Hathaway who plays Andrea Sachs, a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as Miranda Priestly assistant at `Runway Magazine'.  Anne Hathaway proves with her performance that she's all grown up.  No, that's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like `Havoc' and the masterpiece `Brokeback Mountain', but here Anne proves that she can do adult comedy, not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in `The Princess Diaries' but keeping everything smart and mature.  She has enough poise and grace to match wits with Miranda, and she does so elegantly.

Next up is Emily Blunt who plays Emily, Miranda's first assistant (there are two, Andrea being the second).  Emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is, slaving for the unruly Priestly and it's all about to pay off with a trip alongside Miranda to Paris.  The only thing standing in her way is Andrea, for if Andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on Emily.  Emily Blunt turns out I think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass, enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her.

Stanley Tucci also does wonderfully here as Nigel, Miranda's second in command.  He is there to make sure everything is perfect, and also help Andrea adjust.  Stanley always has done great backup work, playing second hand man to just about everyone, but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it.  He delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the `token gay guy'...he's needed in this film, not filler, and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd.

And then, of course, we have Meryl Streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as Miranda Priestly.  What I was most impressed about was the way Meryl underplays every word, every emotion, every scene, which is not what I expected.  I really expected her to go all Glen Close and reincarnate Cruella but she didn't (thankfully) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year.  She must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of `Runway'.  She lets us see inside her character briefly (when crying over another failed marriage) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we don't get to see the real Miranda because we're not supposed to.

Carried by these four brilliant performances `The Devil Wears Prada' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone.  The script is brilliantly adapted from Lauren Weisberger's novel, and while it's not an exact replica (are any adaptations these days?) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and, in my eyes, more enjoyable.  Bravo!",1160438400,66,3440,4.649586776859504

Rare jewel that made me go to the theaters twice to enjoy Meryl Streep's comic genius. I know that this movie is not just like the book, which had a lot more that what we saw on a screen and it only covered a surface of it, but you will start laughing 5-10 minutes into it and wish the movie would not end. Meryl Streep deserves an Oscar, I don't care what anyone says. Comedies are usually not recognized during Oscars, but performance that good needs to be recognized. Perfect timing, perfect execution, facial expressions and one liners that will make you laugh till your stomach hearts. And that is all I will say.

In comes Miranda Priestly played by (Meryl Streep) the boss who might as well be the devil. Andrea soon learns that the job is a test of patience and whole lot of wit, especially with the endless and ridiculous demands by her employer.

I understand why the entire novel could not show up on the screen. This I think,is a very well crafted adaption.  I would love to see some behind the scenes items on the dvd. For example, a making of the film, the wordrobe from the film,(a fashion show for example);  also a cast and crew interview would be nice.",1160006400,4,611,4.545454545454546
1563433,3,B00005JP0C,"Andrea Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway) moves to NYC to find a job in the journalism career track...and ends up working as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (brilliantly played by the Great Meryl Streep), editor-in-chief of Runway Magazine. It's a job ""a million girls would die for"".  And thus begins Andrea's demise as she compromises her morals, family and friends in order to give in to the ridiculous demands of her employer.

The story is based on Lauren Weisberger's novel, and I use the term ""based on"" extremely loosely.
If you've read the book, prepare yourself for a massacre that leaves no one unscathed.
This is probably the worst adaptation for the big screen I've seen, and that includes the first two Harry Potters.
The movie rids the story of its wittiness, dark humor and pretty much its essence, and climbs its moral horse, this time for ""the Work World is a harsh place for women, who have to resort to compromising themselves in order to succeed""...Not that I don't agree with that, just make a different movie.
Compared to the book, Miranda seems like an abandoned kitten in the movie and seems too ""humane"".  Andrea's best friend who played a crucial role in the movie is almost non-existant, the boyfriend is now a cook instead of a Bronx schoolteacher, and Andrea in the movie doesn't seem to have gone ""to the dark side of life"" nor especially close to a nervous breakdown, unlike in the book.
Andrea's dark, witty humor isn't there, and 90% of what Miranda demanded her to do doesn't make it to the screen, depriving it of many hilarious scenes.  But out of all the people they butchered, the one I was most dissapointed about was the doorman, the one who wouldn't let Andrea in unless she sang unusual songs and danced to them...they didn't even bother to include him, and I was really looking forward to seeing that.

So why the 3 stars?  Well, despite the horrible adaptation, the movie in itself isn't bad.  If you haven't read the book, I'd say you'll probably thoroughly enjoy the movie, and I'll recommend that you read the book afterwards, because you'd be missing out on something.  Plus there's the whole fashion aspect of it (I loved the part where Miranda gives Andrea the entire fashion history of the sweater she's wearing at one point).

The acting is all good : Meryl Streep is amazing and perfect as Miranda (I got chills), so is Stan Tucci.  Anne Hathaway is extremely decent as well. Emily Blunt is the revelation of the movie, and although I questioned the casting of Adrien Grenier and Simon Baker, they all fit well.
And the soundtrack helps everything.  I loved the music and it fit really well with the whole feeling of the movie.

It's a fun, entertaining movie, and while those who read the novel first should proceed with extreme caution when it comes to comparing the two, it's a guaranteed good time.  Plus, you can't go wrong with Meryl Streep!",1159920000,5,2903,4.690944881889764

1563485,5,B00005JP0C,"The Devil Wears Prada sells the life of a new university graduate working under the notoriously demanding and unforgiving boss. The boss is ""god"" at work and it is either obedience or goodbye. Based on the book bearing the same name by Lauren Weisberger, which was said to be a semi-biography of her real life experience, the audience might be expecting a lot of back stabbing and bitching and poking jokes at anorexic models and fashionable girls. However, it proves that the movie is something more than that.

All the funny and bitching bits were in the trailers. So if you are looking forward to more of those, probably getting the trailer will do so. The movie is more about survival in a tough environment, going through close shaves at work and how to be a human being while you strive for survival at workplace. There is no definite answers to the last one but it does bring us to think about choices. The choice you made when you think there are no choices - that's the essence of what's the movie is about. Working hard, finally earning the trust of your boss is just the beginning of office politics that you get slammed into against your will. Also when you are the person around the beast everyone scares and hates, how can you survive on the battle field and at the same time who is your enemey and who is your ally? The funny part is that the most gorgeous, good looking person you met might not be the person you think who he / she is. Characters in the movie are realist, ruthless but human at the same time. I remember I recently made comments about God being very fair in a way that nearly every workplace has office politics, no matter you like it or not. Being in part of the environment forces you into it and to survive and success takes a lot of tolls. This is exactly the world in The Devil Wears Prada.

Meryl Streep plays Miranda and of course flawlessly. It might not be the most demanding roles in her career but she nailed it down without a single second of hesitation. There are of course bits and pieces that showcase she is Meryl Streep not for no reasons. Compared to her Anne Hathaway who was great in Brokeback Mountain became a real apprentice. She is not bad at all but with such a strong person in most of the scenes together, it's really learning most of the time, just like her character in the movie. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci form the remainder of the main cast. Emily provided a lot of comical moments for the movie but then you get bored afterwards cos a lot of them are similar and that makes you feel bad for her cos she is very into the character. Stanley Tucci survive the tug-of-war in performance. He is great and facing Meryl Streep he did pulled off the performance gracefully and professionally. As the mentor for the Andy (Anne) he lives through things that he thought he would never live through, again, because of the ruthless nature of a competitive office environment.

The Devil Wears Prada is really a movie about choices and who you want to be. It poses the question of ""do you need to be a ruthless devil to be professionally successful?"" One of the things that's also worth mentioning is the question of if Miranda (Meryl Streep) is a man, would people still regard her as the devil? Things were cleverly written and smart resonances can be found littering around in the whole movie.

Two last notes: if you love Simon Baker (the Australian heart throb in the Guardian) you will be happy. And if you are in Madonna, you got a small dose of her songs that fit completely well into this world.",1159660800,2,3559,4.45398773006135

It starts out with a girl going to a job interview and being the most unlikely candidate for the job.  She ends up getting the job, much to her surprise and the surprise of her co-workers, and then it takes her on a rollercoaster ride.  Her integrity and passion for the job is questioned throughout the movie; she and her boyfriend even have trouble because of her job.

Everyone in this movie did wonderfully with their performances.  Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep and I am not sure of her name but the girl who played Emily were by far the best!

Scrapping the barrel's bottom for jobs, she ends up as second assistant for the domineering ""Dragon-lady"" Meryl Streep, chief editor of a high-powered fashion magazine.

Its a pretty vapid movie, and falls flat, although I did get a few laughs from it. Its pretty harmless... except on closer inspection. Anne Hathaway's character is supposed to be the heroine who comes to realize what she ""really wants"" even when offered glitz and glamour, but it really fell short for me because of some of 'Andrea's' decisions.

My Beef:

--Anne's character NEVER shows integrity: whats with sleeping with the blond guy? Quitting in the middle of a show?

--the quiet moment with Meryl Streep really fell flat for me. It obviously was supposed to show her humanity, but didn't achieve the right tone.

--if I heard ""million girls would kill"" in ANY context again--ugh!

--the friendship between Andrea and her male-coworker, as well as how she a) gets all the clothes b) needs rent money from her dad? etc, never really well-explained

1563489,5,B00005JP0C,"Whoever's idea to buy the rights to Lauren Weisberger's novel is a genius. Despite a rather abysmal novel, The Devil Wears Prada shines on screen. Indeed, The Devil Wears Prada is an example of how some storylines work much better on the big screen than in print.

The film's stylish success is due largely to the over-the-top character Miranda Priestly played by Meryl Streep, the incredible  actress who has wowed us with many impeccable performances. Streep revealed a well-kept secret - her gene for comedy which has so far been demonstrated only in Death Becomes Her (1992) and  to some degrees in last year's Prime. Anyone else might have turned Miranda into a noisy empty vessel but Streep gives Miranda life and great stature.

Miranda is the go-getting and ridiculously demanding-cum-bitchy editor-in-chief of Runway magazine. And incidentally, the matron of this acclaimed magazine house is the head of many like-minded employees including an overzealous first assistant (Emily Hunt) and second-in-command (Stancy Tucci). So when the just graduated wide-eyed Andy Sachs played by Anne Hathaway assumes her position as the second assistant to Miranda, Streep's deadpan no-nonsense stance combined with her ultra-acerbic tongue make Sachs life indeterminately difficult. Not willing to give up, the young lass transforms herself from a dowdy girl to a glamorpuss who satisfies every of Miranda's whim and fancies. Intertwined with this are also a love story and another of finding who you really are and want to be.

Streep's comic brilliance makes the character of Miranda Priestly so illuminating and unpologetic while complementing the innoncence of Hathaway's Andy Sachs whose only aspiration is to be a proper journalist rather than a fashion junkie. Stanley Tucci's performance also adds more zest to the film. Last of all, the dazzling couture pieces that appear so frequently is bound to make Devil an ultimate fashion feast.

In the end, The Devil Wears Prada is highly entertaining with an Oscar-worthy performance from Streep whose artistry is undeniably and undisputedly ace. (A)",1157155200,4,2099,5.326283987915408

Although the movie center's wound Anne Hathaway's character, Meryl Streep steals the show.  Her represntation of the dragon lady boss was dead on!  Not the high-octane-greedy-loud-mouthed CEO so typical of Hollywood films, but a very realistic view of Bosses at the top and the manner in which their subordinates react to meet their demands. She's controlled, soft spoken, unyielding and very firm...and she knows the business better than anyone else.  It's funny to watch people scramble to meet her impossible demands.

She requires her lowly, untrained, inexperienced assistant to perform miracles and menial chores every day, and we never see Miranda do anything extraordinary. Miranda mumbles her cryptic orders too fast even for a court stenographer to understand. We witness Andy, the naive, fashion-challenged new assistant, undergo a fashion and personality makeover, topping it off with an affair not to remember. We see the devastation of everyone's personal life, which isn't even good for dark humor. We hear an oddly earnest speech about the merits of a dysfunctional, destructive, and corrupt work ethic.

Great movie with some nice life lessons to boot.

The only gripe I had is with the way Andrea is treated by her friends. I felt they were unsupportive. The boyfriend was selfish and whiny. Andrea wanted to be a success. That's part of the reason why people go to college: so they can be successful in a career. And Andrea was doing really well. Yes, she was extremely busy but that was her job. The boyfriend should have been much more understanding. I mean, he gets a new job and Andrea is supposed to be all happy for him while she apologizes for living it up a little. That's where the moral gets a little distorted. I say follow your dreams and make it big when the opportunity hits. If your friends don't support you as in Andrea's case....get new friends.

1563493,5,B00005JP0C,"This movie shows us a transformation of Andy(Anne Hathaway) a beautiful, sweet, and all American young lady, with a laid-back approach to life who has just graduated from college with a degree in journalism, into a totally commited and dedicated professional who becomes the envy of many in the fashion world.  Perhaps the catalyst of this transformation is Nigel(Stanley Tucci) who is the only person willing to mentor Andy.  In one very crucial scene, when Andy comes crying to him(she has no one else to turn to in the firm) He tells her that she needs to understand that she must see the value in her work and the fashion industry, that it is immature to degrade an artform because it has been kept at a distance from her all her life.  This is the time in her life that she needs to step up to the plate and hit a homerun!  She shows the very important trait of genius:  the ability to listen!  She shows us that she can rise to the challenge and we can't help but feel proud of her.  Does she become spoiled by all this?  No!  She gets through it all with all her values intact and remains the wonderful woman that she is.  What a wonderful success story for feminism!  But what about her friends?  Instead of being happy for her, all they do is whine that she works too hard, and can't spend enough of time with them!  They tell her that her values have been distorted, but what do they expect from her?  She is still shown to us as her sweet self, just very busy and professional.  This is the only problem I had with this movie.  Does she give in to her friends at the end?  It would seem so, but this idea appears to be unjustified by the events of the movie.  There seems to be some confusion on this point.  Other than this(perhaps a little confusion is good!), the look and flow of the action were very pleasing, with wonderful fashion photography, set design, and effective dialog.

1563543,5,B00005JP0C,"Ruthless ambition is rampant when money or power is at stake.  Ruthlessness applies to anything at the top of its game.  For example, how ruthless is politics known to be, or religion???  Thus, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is the only choice for top editor of Runway Magazine, as is defined in the final scenes, when the publisher realizes there are no second choices for the job. She balances success with all the right elements, such that others might crash and burn immediately, trying to walk in her shoes.  Probably, this character will inspire many a ""rising star"" to be the best that they can be.

I have been ""abused"" by managers in many different fields.  I find that competition breeds and demands fierce commitment.  So, if you can't stand the heat, then get out of the kitchen.  This axiom sums up practical defense of ruthlessness in contrast to the morality play that impresses so many of the reviewers here.  To me, it's about being able to perform your job, not about what you trade in morals or emotions to do your job.  Imagine that Andy worked at The New York Times, Washington Post, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, Esquire, or wherever, for a male editor-in-chief with way more testosterone than Miranda.  (He, he, he)  And I, for one, prefer competitive people who can survive competing with the world's finest to produce the finest goods and services.  It may be that some people might confuse people orientation with business orientation, or even religion.  I am not confused.  All these are valuable in their spheres.  However, I loathe tokens or quotas on the front lines of battle, no matter the forum.  The front lines require champions, even when they are fighting for more grant money for poor children or senior citizens.

I have been a fan of Meryl Streep's for such a long time, especially since Sophie's Choice.  A part of Sophie is revealed in Miranda, when she confides in Andy.  That one time.

Anyway, I actually cheered in the first third of the movie, when all the fabulous clothes of the ""clackers"" strutted across the screen. (Including the montage of Miranda arriving at work with her coat and bag.)  I own 96 pairs of shoes, including Prada, Miu Miu, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Kenneth Cole, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Brutini, Cole Haan, Diesel, To Boot New York, and Jill Sander.  This kind of superficial shallowness is either in your blood or not.  I have found some ""victims"" who use fashion as a hobby, and others who merely try to fit in by wearing the ""right clothes.""  Fashion is my hobby; I willingly buy clothes rather than food.  Fashion is not my career.  It matters not to me why people dress up; I just love to see it.  I often compare a human to a blank canvas, and clothes to paint.  Often, there are resulting masterpieces.

Please do see this movie, if you haven't already, for the sheer luxury of the clothes and corporate lair set as the background to the beautiful clothes and accompanying drama.

Aside from the fundamental theme of moral choice, this movie is more form than function.  And if you just kick back and enjoy the sight of it, you'll leave with the best impression.

Simply put, The Devil Wears Prada is about corruption. Not political or business, but personal. The big question this movie asks is ""How much of yourself are you willing to let go of to get what you want? Or what you think you want?"" In this Summer's blockbuster comedy-drama, this question is not as easily answered as one might think.

Miranda Priestly has given up everything to become the president of Runway Magazine, the most expensive, most popular fashion periodical ever to hit the racks. To raise the magazine to such a prestigious level, Miranda has sacrificed everything -- marriages, vacations, family. Her latest need, however, is fairly simple: a new office assistant. Enter Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway, HOODWINKED) a frumpy looking young lady who recently graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in journalism. Andy tries to use her position at Runway Magazine as a stepping stone to bigger and better jobs, but is soon sucked into the high-price, high-pressure world of fashion. She rapidly becomes Mrs. Priestly's direct assistant and has to be on-call 24/7. This wreaks havoc on her relationship with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier, ACROSS THE HALL) as she shows up late for dinners and even bypasses his birthday party.

A dawning awareness of what she's become (or might become) soon hits Andy and she's forced into making a decision that'll affect the rest of her life. Should she stay with Mrs. Priestly and become a wealthy design assistant with an ulcer? Or should she follow her original dream of becoming a journalist? In a set of excellent circumstances where Mrs. Priestly really needs her, Andy finally makes her decision.

It's a ""stand up and applaud"" moment for many viewers and even Meryl Streep's Miranda character seems pleased with Andy's choice ...right before she yells, ""Go!"" to her driver at the end of the film, indicating she may have approved of Andy's choice, but she's already made her own.

Anne Hathaway pulls in a ""beauty"" of a part as Andy Sachs. Mrs. Hathaway is a great looking lady (even when ""frumped"" up) but I'd be willing to bet she's never been a size six! She's so tiny!

But Meryl Streep's performance is simply amazing. Her b! tchy, bossy, hardheaded, businesswoman performance was absolutely perfect! When she first meets Hathaway's character and says, ""You don't have any fashion sense.""

And Andy says, ""Well I do, it's just--""

""That wasn't a question,"" Streep interrupts.

That exchange sets the stage for this dynamite relationship between the two.

But this is a fine little movie that, despite its rather predictable and silly storyline, gives a number of fine actors the opportunity to sharpen their skills in playing roles not usually associated with their repertoire. Especially in the case of the brilliant Meryl Streep, who here proves she can be a convincing evil witch and yet hold our attention for her rare vulnerable moments.  This is a piece of powerful characterization.

The story is both well known because of Lauren Weisberger's Top 10 on the charts novel and because the story of a plain Jane making it big in the corporate world at the risk of jeopardizing her ideals and private life.  But the story works again, this time draped in the fashion magazine industry.

Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a reporter without a job, a girl simple and physically unsophisticated with a chef boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and extended family, who is placed for interview with Runway Magazine as the personal assistant to the editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). And is dowdy but smart, and Miranda decides to take her one despite her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) and jeering crowd's amazement.  Miranda is a Diva who is a control freak, spits out demands as she tosses her wrap and purse on the assistant's desk, communicates only is stingingly acidic one liners,  and is in general a fearsome Titanic of a woman.  The story revolves around Andy's transformation by magazine worker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) et al and within weeks Andy is Miranda's right hand person, responsible to her whims 24/7.  This obligation and change wrecks havoc with Andy's personal life, leads to a Paris fashion trip, an encounter with Christian Thompson (Simon Baker),a hunky writer with high credentials when sets out to woo Andy, and eventually Andy must make some choices about the speedy treadmill on which she finds herself.

Yes, it is a bit of Working Girl, Cinderella, etc but it works on screen due largely to the fine performances by the entire cast - but especially for the stunning tour de force by Streep. Clothed in an endless array of fashionable outfits, Streep is the epitome of the fashion guru: she hasn't looked this beautiful in a long time and this film reminds us that she is a very attractive as well as inordinately gifted actress.  This role is so well played that it may even be listed in the Oscar category.  Now who would have ever expected that from the rather silly idea of The Devil Wears Prada?  Strong work!

1563551,4,B00005JP0C,"Adapted from the book of the same name, The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andy Sachs as she navigates through the ruthless world of high fashion publishing.

Andy, played by Anne Hathaway, is an idealistic young woman. A new graduate trying to be a serious journalist, she interviews for the assistant position as a last resort and she wins the position a million women would kill for despite her own lack of interest and aptitude for fashion. Hathaway provides an admirable performance full of humor and heart. Her character manages to maintain her idealism and view others through rose-tinted glasses even while she is pushed to conform to the fashion world around her. In her desperate effort to get things 'right' she loses herself in the process.

Although The Devil Wears Prada is told through the eyes of Andy, the true star and center of the film is Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly. Miranda could have been played over the top but Streep delivers an underplayed, yet layered performance as only she can do. Outwardly calm and controlled at all times, she also manages to convey her character's fierce love for her children and admiration for Andy's intelligence and determination. There is also some wistfulness and sadness as she witnesses someone who is seemingly much like herself before her career became everything.

Andy is guided through the world of fashion by supporting characters Nigel and Emily. The under-appreciated Nigel helps her develop a stylistic fashion sense despite being a ""fat"" size 6 while overworked, desperate Emily helps her learn her responsibilities as ""the new Emily"", the job Emily once held. Her boyfriend, Nate and friend, Lilly who serve to keep her grounded in her previous life, balance these characters.

David Frankel does a wonderful job directing the film, providing both laughter and drama as Andy learns about the world of high fashion publishing and then learns its consequences. His montage showing Andy's progress is particularly well done while his admiration for the City of New York is clear as he guides you around the city, showing the energy around both those already established and those just starting out.

The film is not without its faults. Primarily, being too perfect flaws the character of Andy. The idealism she comes to ""Runway Magazine"" with is barely challenged and never waivers. She never questions the goodness and integrity of those around her. Despite her college journalistic reporting, living in New York seeking her future and then working in this rarified atmosphere, she remains more innocent than should be possible.

However, it is an enjoyable film, providing fun, laughter and even a few tears. It is well worth viewing at least once if not more.",1153094400,4,2740,5.037527593818985
1563631,4,B00005JP0C,"Andy Sachs (Hathaway) applies for the job of second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep), the editor of ""Runway"" magazine.  ""Runway"" is THE magazine for the fashion industry, and Andy has no fashion sense.  Miranda is revered by all who know her.  She has the power to make or break people in the industry, and she is not afraid to use this power.  Work for her for a year, and countless doors will open.  Of course, others like Emily (Blunt), Miranda's number one assistant and Nigel (Tucci) have become fixtures at the magazine, while waiting for those doors to open.

Miranda hires Andy on a whim, hoping she has what it takes despite her appearance.  Andy dislikes the shallowness of her coworkers, but soon finds herself becoming more like them.  Will she get sucked into that lifestyle, or will she me able to resist and remain true to herself?

Meryl Streep makes this movie work, and is the prime reason to see it.  She dominates every scene she is in.  She is both cruel and funny, sometimes at the same time.  Hathaway, Tucci, and Blunt are also very good, especially when playing off of each other.  This is definitely a ""chick flick"", but is entertaining and really funny at times.

1563632,5,B00005JP0C,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the best movie I have seen all year!  Hands down.  This is a wonderful movie that has some of the best acting I've ever enjoyed on screen.  The film says ""quality"" from beginning to end.  It's for people who like real movies more than Hollywood formula tripe.

I think that most everyone knows that Meryl Streep is one of the greatest living actresses this country has ever seen, and she proves that to the max in Prada.  I believe this may have been her finest role.  Meryl Streep plays ""the Devil"" (Miranda Priestly) and Anne Hathaway plays ""Emily"" (Andy Sachs) in this wonderful comedy which is also a movie about choices and values.  I will tell you nothing about the plot.  It's best to let it unravel before your eyes.  Is it about working in the fashion industry for the top fashion magazine.  Who would have thought that could be so fascinating?

It will have you laughing hard from human interest type comedy, and it will have you sympathizing with both the ""victim"" and the ""villain.""  In the end, it will have you crying.

Take my word for it, this is a truly wonderful movie that will lift your spirits and keep you glued to your seats.  Do your friends a favor - take them to see this.  They will be grateful that you have such good taste.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars, and I would give it double that if I could.  This is the best movie of the year.  If Meryl Streep doesn't win an Academy Award, then no one should get it.  No one can top her.  She is just too good.",1152576000,5,1509,4.261484098939929
1563633,4,B00005JP0C,"This summer's hit for mature moviegoers is ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" starring Meryl Streep as the proverbial boss from hell.  Streep has a field day playing Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of Runway, an influential fashion magazine.  Miranda is an insensitive, self-centered, sarcastic, and overbearing megalomaniac, who expects her employees to devote themselves to her, 24/7.

Anne Hathaway is Andy Sachs, a naive and unprepossessing young woman who yearns to become a serious journalist.  By some miracle, she lands a job as Miranda's assistant, a position for which she is spectacularly unsuited.  First of all, Andy is a fashion disaster, preferring staid skirts and sweaters to designer outfits.  She lives in a dumpy apartment and is chronically short of cash.  In addition, she is a kindhearted and easygoing woman who adores her live-in lover, Nate, and enjoys hanging out with friends.  She is the last person one would expect to become a successful gofer for a sadistic egotist.

However, the formula dictates that:  1) the plain duckling must become a fashionable swan 2) she will become so obsessed with pleasing her boss that she neglects her loved ones 3) she will lose touch with the values she has always held so dear.  The script, by Aline Brosh McKenna, is breezy and filled with amusing one-liners.  David Frankel directs with brisk efficiency, giving the audience little time to ponder the story's lack of logic.  The movie looks good and is tightly edited, and the actors all perform with verve.  Hathaway is effective as a woman who is forced to decide what she really wants out of life.  Stanley Tucci is wonderful as Nigel, a man for whom fashion is a religion at whose altar he fervently worships.  Nigel mentors Andy and helps her survive Miranda's onslaughts.

Meryl Streep, looking chic and sleek, steals every scene in which she appears.  Whether she is throwing her coat and bag at her assistants, wrinkling her nose disdainfully at her staff's ideas for a fashion layout, celebrating a victory over a hated rival, or showing her vulnerability when her personal life falls apart, Streep is perfection.  ""Prada"" is great fun and delightful escapist entertainment.",1152489600,4,2198,5.089385474860335

Besides lots of similiarities, the biggest improvement in the movie version, came in the second-half, when the fashion try-ons were conducted by the Staff and one observed the nitty-gritty of Tucci and Company, either concurring with Miranda or daring to risk their personal opinions in the light of their Witch-Bitchy Boss!

It appeared to me that that marvelous portrayal of Miranda by Meryl Streep at times, allowed you to see the more human side of Miranda in an occassional slip over into her inner positive aside that was tinged with a bit of good humor instead of evil deleriums! I was in total awe of Meryl Streep's magical innuendo-filled performance of Miranda's layers of caustic comments and fatalistic asides to a slightest whim towards her employees!

Near the ending month, as she personally quizzed Andrea what she was interested in doing next, she gave Andrea her greatly  surprising appraisal of ""being reasonably competent.""  Then she volunteered the offer to make a personal call to the New Yorker Magazine! I was hooked in that being blanked-out in my memory of hearing the conversation at the noisy THEATER.

It also makes one think about ambition versus love.

1563637,2,B00005JP0C,"I can live with the fact that the film version of Lauren Weisberger's THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, is a shell of the novel.  Other than the basic story, the main characters and all of $pectacular couture, virtually nothing about this film was mentioned in the book.

I understand that some of this has to do with the fact that neither the film makers nor the actors involved wanted to skewer Vogue magazine's Anna Wintour as much as her former whiny assistant did in her debut novel. But I cannot understand why this film was so relentlessly boring.

In a nutshell THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is the story of Northwestern grad, Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathway) and her first post college job as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the snippy editrix of Runway, a montly fashion magazine that is blantantly based on Vogue.

While the book's plot was scooped out and replaced by a completely different story, some of the performances here were good.  Best of all is Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, Runway's second in command, who takes it upon himself to assasinate Andrea's wardrobe, figure and personality before helping to reinvent her as a major fashionista.  Also very funny is Meryl Streep, who surprise, surprise takes the ball and runs with it and proves to be a great comedic actress.  Some will also recognize Gieslle Bundchen, the reigning queen of the catwalk in real life, who here plays the minor role of a friend of Miranda's first assistant.

Because the story itself is so boring, one is left in the theater to admire the real star of this film: Patricia Field, the stylist and designer who worked on Sex and the City and who here is responsible for making the film at least visually interesting.

1563638,5,B00005JP0C,"Meryl Streep is absolutely hilarious playing Miranda Priestly, the editor of the world famous fashion magazine ""Runway"". Along comes Andrea (Andi) Sachs for a job interview. She recently graduated from Northwestern University as a journalism major. Emily, the first assistant to Miranda, nearly snickers in Andrea's face as she looks her up and down and makes snobbish critical remarks about her unfashionable ordinairy clothes. Everyone in the office is calm, casual, and laid back until they learn Miranda Priestly is returning to the office when they go into ""high alert"".

The grand entrance by Miranda is superb, her haughty but elegant manner is perfect, with one breath and in one single sentence she rattles off six or seven commands to her assisant. Everyone jumps to attention and gets into action ... Andrea's interview is nearly cut short when Miranda notes she lacks the fashion background Miranda is looking for. However Miranda is won over by Andi's sincere work ethic and despite misgivings hires her. As second assistant, Andi manages to pull off miracle after miracle to make things happen for Miranda. It is when she does the impossible: obtains a publisher's copy of the latest Harry Potter book for Miranda's twin daughters that Andi's star at Runway begins to rise but at a huge cost to her personal life. Through a series of most auspicious but unexpected events, it is Andi who goes to the spring Paris fashion show with Miranda and a very select group of Runway staff. In Paris Andi comes to terms with her own values and resolves some personal struggles about her job and what she wants from life ...

The film is a parody about the serious competition which exists in the fashion and magazine publishing industries. The tensions, dramas, and back-stabbing are clearly evident. Dealing with the stresses and strains associated with trying to separate one's personal and professional life is very difficult. It becomes clear, the price of success means favoring work over family and friends . As Miranda Priestly said to Andi after returning from the spring Paris fashion show and as she stepped out from the limo amidst photographers and reporters: ""They all want to be us"" ... This film is most highly recommended - a sparkling gem of a film. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1152057600,27,2298,4.981770833333333
1563639,2,B00005JP0C,"Wow, I don't know what's worse: the fact that Hollywood keeps on making lousy movies, the fact that people keep watching them, or the fact they get 4-star and 5-star ratings.  ""The Godfather"" is a 5-star movie; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a 4-star movie.  This is 2-star material, 3 if you're being generous.

The movie wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have a predictable plot, lousy acting (aside from Streep's successful portrayal of a nasty boss, but who needs an actor to do that?), and a 2-hour plus running time.  Our heroine realizes that the life of fashion isn't exactly what she wanted, and she eventually loses touch with her friends, so she throws away the glitz and glamor for her old life.  The end.  Amazingly insightful.  Too bad we've seen this a million times.

I haven't seen a movie in over 2 years, and after this one I remembered why I stopped.  You go home with a good feeling in your tummy because you saw a happy ending, but at the same time you feel like you totally got ripped off by a mediocre movie with nothing special going for it.

1563723,3,B00005JP0C,"Andrea (Anne Hathaway, ""The Princess Diaries"", ""Brokeback Mountain""), fresh out of Northwestern University and clutching her journalism degree, arrives in New York looking for her first job in publishing. At her only interview, she is offered the choice of working at a Car magazine or as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), demanding editor of ""Runway"", THE fashion industry bible. The first meeting does not go well, but Emily (Emily Blunt), Miranda's first assistant informs her she got the job. The next morning, Andrea receives a call at 6:15 am and realizes she is way out of her depth. One day  Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Miranda's favored Print Editor, gives Andrea the lowdown; she hasn't been able to get a handle on the job because she thinks the job is below her. Realizing he is right, Andrea seeks his help with a fashion makeover and she soon proves adept at the job, surprising her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier, HBO's ""Entourage"") and a respected writer (Simon Baker) who shows an interest in more than just giving her help her publish `real' writing.

""The Devil Wears Prada"", based on the enormously popular bestseller, has finally made it to the screen. It is an oft-told tale, many times in a more compelling fashion, but a standout performance and some funny moments help the film stand out. Barely.

It is difficult to watch a great actor in a film that doesn't live up to their performance. Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I can be objective (""Prime"", ""A Prairie Home Companion""). ""Prada"" is overall better than her previous few films, but it is still along way from great. But Streep is by far the best thing in the film, her performance is outstanding. As Miranda, the demanding, bitchy editor of a ""Vogue"" like magazine, she embodies the character so fully, we feel a chill running down our spine every time she walks on screen. Many bosses are demanding, domineering and manipulative but the difference is Miranda lives and breathes the job and this magazine. It is her life. As such, she expects her assistants to be able to get things done. Of course, there are bosses out there who take this to the extreme; they begin speaking in shorthand, ask for more things than one person can handle, make outrageous demands. This is where the comedy comes in.

It wouldn't be unusual or amusing if Miranda were simply demanding, she has to be impossible. As soon as the office learns she is on her way, they quickly change out of sensible, comfortable shoes into more fashionable pumps. Every morning when she comes in, she dumps her purse and coat on the desk of her second assistant and ignores Andrea's greeting before entering her own office to find a super hot Starbucks and the competitor's magazines laid out on her desk. She expects her assistants to work miracles; get stores to open early (which they do, for Miranda), get the new, unpublished Harry Potter book, the like. Amazingly, Andrea learns how to do this and becomes quite adept.",1152057600,7,2992,4.803883495145631

1563727,4,B00005JP0C,"The Devil Wears Prada is a perfectly predictable movie about an innocent would-be journalist who takes a job with a ""Dragon Lady"" of a boss, certain that with a year of experience under her belt, she can get the job of her dreams as a ""real"" journalist. The danger is that our Sweet Young Thing begins to adopt the attitudes of the fashion-is-everything, ignore-friends-and-family values, and becomes what she once hated.

It's fun summer fluff, an enjoyable romp held together with fine acting -- Meryl Streep *is* as good as everyone else says, and Stanley Tucci is a hoot -- especially if you look at it as an opportunity to be vicariously bitchy. Streep's awful bossiness -- if her coffee isn't on time, there's hell to pay -- is only part of the terrible culture of the office, in which meanness and snarkiness is seemingly the only way for people to interact. Since this is likely to be  worse than any real job you have ever had, it's a fun escape because you can laugh at the situation... and wish that YOU had thought of some of those smart-aleck responses.

Some shows get all their laughs from people being mean to one another, and the result is offensive; I don't think it's funny to hurt other people. Somehow, this movie manages to keep the values in place: the mean people aren't presented as ""gosh aren't you clever"" role models, but simply as mean people. This stays a light summer flick, just the sort of entertainment you want from a two-hour escape.",1151971200,5,1469,4.620689655172414
1563728,4,B00005JP0C,"I read the book and loved it. Because I live in the Midwest, this isn't exactly a world that I'm exposed to, and it's a blast joining this fashion frenzied crowd for a few hundred pages. The same can be said of the movie. It's fun while it lasts. And what makes it so much fun is, duh, Meryl Streep. No one can stop talking about how excellent she is in this, even Anne Hathaway admits that Meryl steals the show. And she does. She's a sharp-tongued, fashionista, editor bitch, whose claws are permanently out and scratching at the eyes of her assitants and, well, anyone else around her that doesn't do exactly what she wants exactly the way she says.

Hathaway plays Andrea, a bright-eyed college grad, who wants nothing more than to be a writer in NYC. How grand! She can't seem to get a writing job, but manages to snatch the job ""a million girls would kill for""-- being the assitant to the demanding Miranda Priestly (Streep), editor of the hot and hip magazine called Runway. Andrea doesn't fit into this world of couture and makeup, a world where the new size 4 is a size 2, and size 6 (Andrea's size) is the new 14. Ouch. But Andrea is determined to stick it out, going so far as to alienate her boyfriend Nate (Adrien Grenier), her friends, her family, and herself, all so she can get her dream job-- because as everyone knows, one year serving Miranda means that she can hook you up with a job. ANYWHERE YOU WANT.

Anne Hathaway is, as always, a likable personality. What little we see of Grenier is pleasing, if for the simple fact that he's so adorably messy and cute. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci (as the cliche gay guy who helps the clueless girl, though Tucci OWNS this role) are the show stealers. And I can't not mention Simon Baker. Just because he's hot. Oh, and his character does manage to be effective in the few minutes they give him on screen. Great soundtrack, cute story, biting wit-- what more can a girl ask for?? Hm... maybe the new Marc Jacobs bag??",1151971200,8,1981,4.424657534246576
1563729,4,B00005JP0C,"I was much more entertained by the TDWP than I expected to be. The movie took the best parts of the book, humanized the characters, and made them more 3-dimensional than they were on paper. Meryl Streep demonstrates once again why she is one of the ""grandes dames"" of celluloid, in a pitch-perfect portrayal of Miranda Priestley. Although Streep consistently maintains Miranda's hard edge and bitingly-comedic sarcasm throughout the movie, she also gives us glimpses into the woman behind the mask without watering-down the character the audience loves to hate. I was really pleased to see that the end of the movie refused to insult the audience's intelligence by having Miranda see the ""error of her ways"" and undergo a complete (and unrealistic) character transformation. Rather, she maintains her devilish edge while being wise enough to recognize--and respect--the differences between herself and her 2nd assistant, Andrea (""Andy"").  (Refreshingly, at the end of the movie, Miranda has still got the cojones to pull the rug out from under the ever-loyal Nigel to save her own empire).

Anne Hathaway does a really good job in TDWP, and holds her own in her scenes with Streep--no easy task, since pretty much everyone looks like an amateur next to Meryl. While Anne fittingly brings a bit of that wide-eyed innocence to the role of Andy (which made her a pre-teen sensation in the ""Princess Diaries"" and the like), it does not completely define her character. It was great to see Hathaway push the envelope a bit, and to show the tension between that innocence and the cutthroat, sink-or-swim world of high-fashion publishing.

The rest of the cast also does an admirable job. Stanley Tucci is a gem as Miranda's long-suffering sidekick, Nigel, and Emily Blunt--with her spot-on comedic timing--shows why she's a young actress to watch. And, of course, you've got to love Simon Baker as the incurable, impossibly-handsome rake, Christian Thompson. He is the ultimate guilty pleasure in this movie; the cad you know is no good for Andy, but who is so disarmingly charming that you want to see them hook up anyway. I was not the only woman in the movie theater hoping that Andy would dump her boyfriend Nate and get together with Christian! (No small feat, since Adrian Grenier is pretty easy on the eyes as well).

The only reason this movie didn't get 5 stars is the forced ""reconcilation"" between Andy and Nate. He had no qualms about moving to Boston to chase his dream of becoming a chef, and I don't think that Andy had any reason to be apologetic about being just as driven about her career goals, whether at Runway magazine or elsewhere. To be quite honest, Nate seemed more like a whiner and an impediment than a supportive boyfriend you would want Andy to get back together with. But this is the only minor pet-peeve I have about this film. Otherwise, TDWP was a great movie that I actually enjoyed even more than the book (for a change!), and will definitely be picking up when it's released on video.

1563730,3,B00005JP0C,"Meryl Streep is probably the best character actress of her generation. Playing the devilish Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway, she embodies all that one imagines of a self-centered, sarcastic, materialistic, power-hungry boss, whose sense of accomplishment, applauded by the fawning masses, nevertheless serves only as a monument to her ultimate lack of consequence.

Streep's stupendous performance is framed extremely well by Anne Hathaway's rendition of Andie Sachs, the bumbling, styleless, writer-cum-fashion-expert and ""second assistant"" to Miranda and Stanley Tucci as Nigel, the fashion director for the glossy glamor magazine.

Notwithstanding these superb performances, however, The Devil Wears Prada is a lightweight piece of fluff, good for a few hours of entertainment and relief from the summer heat, but not much besides.

Or, rather, how we *choose* to sell our souls in the process.

The Devil Wears Prada is about a fresh out of college, would-be journalist (Hathaway) who gets her first job as an assistant for a high-powered fashionista (Streep). She soon learns that nothing about her job is fair or even palatable, but that she's going to have to adapt to it in order to accomplish her dreams of being a serious journalist. However, she eventually has to confront the question ""is it worth it?"" as she realizes that the job changes her in the process, and puts her at odds with the people she'd once loved and was loved by.

This is an excellent question, and this film is an excellent examination of that question.

People who've never been in the kind of work environment shown here might not find as much humor in it as I did. What makes it all so funny/painful is how true it all is. I trust that the author of the novel upon which this movie was based must have had a strong real-life experience in a similar situation. While perhaps exaggerated, it's really real.

This is a great film and a good time, and brings up many things worth thinking and talking about. Finally, this review would be remiss if I didn't bring up the incredible display of beauty, here.

1563823,4,B00005JP0C,"Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's ""She-Devil"" and 1992's ""Death Becomes Her"", Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. As Miranda Priestly, the despotic editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly upswept hair; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff.

Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous ""Miami Rhapsody"", and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of ""Sex in the City"" and ""Entourage"". He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. The one-line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to Aline Brosh McKenna's deep-dish script based on Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel, but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all-or-nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers.

The plot's protagonist is not Priestly but Andy Sachs, a young idealist and aspiring journalist who just graduated from Northwestern. Even though she has no interest in fashion, she lands an interview at Runway. Because she is not a typically bootlicking, anorexic fashionista toady, Priestly hires her as her second assistant. It becomes a nightmarish trial by fire, as Andy slowly earns the trust of Priestly much to the chagrin of the haughty first assistant Emily. And despite the derision of her circle of friends, including her live-in boyfriend, Sachs starts to respect Priestly's style and power, which leads to the decision to have Andy go to Paris for Fashion Week. Further complications ensue when a hotshot writer takes an interest in her and a power struggle erupts at Runway.

It really takes someone of Streep's caliber to pull off the impossible character of Priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability, it resonates so much more than it should. Although she is far too pretty to be considered frumpy by anyone's standards, the naturally likable Anne Hathaway plays Sachs serviceably and looks sensational in a series of Chanel outfits. She brings the necessary heart to the story, even though the character arc is rather predictable. It does seem a shame that we are supposed to cheer the character's reduction from size 6 to 4, but that is probably as accurate as anything else in the film.

There is terrific work from the reliable Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Runway's no-nonsense fashion director, especially as he patiently works under Priestly's shadow and gives Sachs hard-to-take survival advice, and from Emily Blunt, who plays first assistant Emily with the ideal combination of vitriol and desperation. Overly metrosexualized with the strangest blond eyebrows I have ever seen, Simon Baker lends an appropriately smarmy edge to his writer Christian Thompson. Far less interesting are Sachs' judgmental friends, in particular, Adrian Grenier as Sachs' sous-chef boyfriend Nate and Tracie Thoms as art gallery manager Lilly (whose putdown of Andy seems way out of line). The ending is inevitable, but it moves in a creative way that makes neither Sachs overly heroic nor Priestly absolutely villainous. This is solid entertainment elevated by the artistry of Streep.",1151884800,5,3512,5.266071428571428
1563824,5,B00005JP0C,"For the person who has suffered working for a boss from hell, he or she can relate to Andy, a recent college graduate who takes a job with the world's most famous fashion magazine, Runway, to get a year of experience under her belt.  Unknowningly, the doe-eyed, fashion-challenged young lady walks into the lair of the devil, Miranda Priestly.  Taking a job in a field she knows nothing about certainly does nothing to impress the vicious and EXTREMELY demanding Miranda, who chews her assistants up and spits them out on a regular basis.

From the start, Andy is fighting an uphill battle.  Slowly, however, with the help of Nigel, one of Miranda's right hand men, who has not lost his soul while working for his evil boss, she decides to change and throw all her effort into pleasing Miranda.  Aided by Nigel, Andy slowly emerges as a fashionable, young assistant proving that she is capable of handling any of Miranda's insane and nearly impossible demands.  However, she soons begins to realize that her job is consuming her life and destroying her relationship with friends and her boyfriend, Nate.  The question that she eventually faces, is how far will she will go with her demanding job---to the top or abandon the normal life she enjoyed with her loved ones.

I read this book and enjoyed it and was delighted to hear that Meryl Streep would play Miranda.  And while the book is told through Andy's eyes, Miranda is the person you can't look away from and this is the deliciously evil kind of role that any actress would enjoy playing.  It is no surprise that Meryl tackles it with amazing ease and oozes an aura of iciness that would freeze you in your spot.  Without raising her voice, she simply slices you down with a pointed sentence that cuts deeper than daggers or simply gives a look of disgust that makes you want to throw up your lunch---in these girls' cases, that would be a miracle since they eat almost nothing.  At any rate, I would love to see Meryl get a nomination for this role because she simply MAKES the movie.

Anne Hathway is a great choice for Andy and your heart certainly goes out to her.  Whether she is trying to get Miranda's hot coffee or trying to get her hands on the manuscript for the latest Harry Potter novel, you feel the dread along with the character as she brings her tasks to the disapproving eyes of Ms. Priestly.  Stanley Tucci also does a great job as Nigel, who takes her under his wing and gives her the chops to make it in the halls of Runway.

For those who read the book, you will not be disappointed.  And for anyone who is a fan of Meryl Streep, this is a movie you will want to see (and later own on dvd).  For those who love fashion, of course, this will be right down your alley!  But for all of us who know how bad a mean boss can be, you will sympathize!  Well worth your time and money!",1151798400,3,2854,4.4414587332053745
1563825,5,B00005JP0C,"Meryl Streep does an excellent performance as ice cold editor Miranda Priestley in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". She perfects an English accent like that of Anna Wintour. She is a no-holds barred woman who expects everyone to worship the ground she walks on; even if those under her are miserable. Andy, played by Ann Hathaway, is looking to further her career in journalism by working as her assistant for Runway magazine. She learns the cutthroat business of the magazine industry which is deeply contrasted to what she was doing in college and her true style of writing. She wanted to get into the industry but finds that it isn't so fair to her as well as the people who work for the publishing industry.

As an aspiring journalist/writer I know already that this type of industry isn't what I am seeking to get into. I don't want to sell my soul to the devil as what Andy did in the movie. It cost her her relationships with her closest friends and family. Although, if you want badly to be in the business as Emily, first assistant to Priestley, then you'd better dig into your heels and do what it takes to get there.

Getting back to Ms. Streep, she is a serious actress and digs into this role excellently. The industry needs women like her that are no-nonsense and intelligent.",1151798400,4,1282,4.569565217391304
1563826,1,B00005JP0C,"Andrea has just graduated from college and opens up her day planner to realize she has an appointment for an interview with Runway Magazine. She somehow gets hired despite being totally inappropriate for the job of Editor-in-Chief Miranda's Priestly's second assistant. She's required to get coffee, hang up Miranda's coat, and many other personal details which have nothing to do with the magazine, but make Miranda's personal life easier.

Although based on the book, the film tries to show Miranda being vulnerable and not a complete bitch every second of the day as in the book, she was. A few things have been changed or added: Andie now lives with her boyfriend, who's a chef instead of a schoolteacher of nine-year old first graders (check with the author of the book on that one), and her best friend is an artist instead of a drunken loser. There's also a male character (Stanley Tucci) who's been working under Miranda for 18 years who tries to buck Andie up when she whines at how Miranda never appreciates her.

Other things stick: Andie thinks that after one year as Miranda's assistant (and so she is told in the book) that she automatically becomes a writer for any magazine she chooses (and if she can't write for a magazine, it doesn't matter because she'll write a tell-all badly written, boring book).

This film is shallow, depressing, and goes nowhere - just like the book.  The ending is changed to try to give the story some redeeming value, but it fails.

The acting isn't bad (even Gisele Bundchen is credible in a small part), but with the lame story the actors had to work with, it's a waste of Meryl Streep. And she's the only reason anyone would see this superficial movie.",1151798400,8,1702,4.717171717171717
1563827,4,B00005JP0C,"The Devil Wears Prada is one of the best comedies and funniest fashion themed films in recent years. I found it totally entertaining and enjoyed every minute of Meryl Streep's wicked and devilish rendition of Miranda Priestley. She managed to make the most of lesser screentime and chews up every scene effortlessly. She's so good at her expressions and body language that she upstaged everyone else in the group scenes. Her character is totally unlikeable, because she's heartless, cold, ruthless, but her performance makes it so delightful. It's unfortunate that Anne Hathaway's unfashionable Andie role took up most of the screentime. Her scenes with the boyfriend and friends really took away from the focus of the film. I wanted to see more of her opposite Streep, and how she worked around the Devil. Yes, I did find the scenes of Miranda's nasty treatments towards Andie became too repetitious, but it was pretty much the funniest moments of the film. It's obvious that Hathaway's performance is not as impressive as Streep and the scene stealing Stanley Tucci who helps her to transform from an ugly duckling into a fashion chick. Emily Blunt who plays Miranda's first assistant gets to have some funny moments to work with. I couldn't stop thinking that she looks so much like Cilian Murphy in Breakfast in Pluto. Overall, the film is very stimulating comedy with lots of high fashion moments, not to mention that they got all the top designer wardrobe for the cast especially Streep who had the most lavish wardrobe changes. Even Valentino made a cameo apperance! I must say that Patricia Field did a marvellous job with the costume, even the ""stuff"" she put together for Andie looks so hideous that it was perfect. I won't be surprised if Streep and Field will receive an Oscar nomination for their memorable works come 2007.",1151712000,3,1836,4.925806451612903
1563828,3,B00005JP0C,"If you can, read the book, and then save the movie for when it is released for rental.  It wasn't bad. The story however, is predictable and the movie is (or at least seemed) long so we were squirming in our seats and ready to go about 20-30 minutes before the conclusion.

Anne Hathaway is cute, transforming her self from undergrad to a NY girl channeling her inner fashion maven. (She did it better in Princess Diaries and she was a lot more fun and likeable in that).

Stanley Tucci, as always, was great but didn't get enough time on the film.

The saving grace and crowning glory though is Meryl Streep as the mean fashion editor (Anna Wintour anyone?) which she played wonderfully, not having to overact but rather relying on the smallest gestures.  She shows why she is still great and can open films!!",1151712000,,810,4.52054794520548
1563829,5,B00005JP0C,"As usual, Meryl Streep delivers a most excellent performance. Also Anne Hathaway was very likeable and I think she did a great job. While Meryl plays the demanding Editor-in-Chief, Miranda Priestly, of a top-notch fashion magazine, she is not really as devlish as the title may indicate -- there are certainly far worse bosses around. Still, in a sense it's a type of comedy, but also with some serious undertones like e.g. dedicating your life to a professional career may ruin your personal life.

Stanley Tucci is also superb -- too bad that he's so underrated. Tucci is an excellent actor and I wish he would show up in more films.

This movie is certainly an enjoyable flick and it also gives some insight into the subjective and egocentric fashion business, but overall it's not to be taken too serious and it's even a spoof in some way. It's really a fun film and the quality acting really makes this film well worth watching.",1151712000,4,933,4.682926829268292
1563830,3,B00005JP0C,"The cinematic version of The Devil Wears Prada was a joy to watch. The theater was filled with couples of allraces,  genders and orientations. Even straight men, there with their girlfriends, laughed at all of the appropriate moments. This is a ""chick flick"" without the sickly sweet aftertaste of the majority of films slapped with that demeaning chick flick moniker. The Devil Wears Prada retains the bitter bite of the movie's ""Devil,"" editrix Miranda Priestly.

Anne Hathaway plays fresh-out-of-college Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs as the idealistic journalist the way you would imagine a Northwestern journalism grad to be. As so sharply pointed out by Stanley Tucci's character, fashion editor Nigel, Andrea feels that working at the fashion magazine Runway is beneath her training and intelligence. She's only there because one year as Miranda Priestly's assistant will guarantee her a spot at any of the more ""literary"" magazines in New York City.

So desperate for that big break, Andy spends every waking moment as Miranda's handmaiden appeasing her most bizarre whims. She sells her soul to the job, leaving friendships, family, and a very cute boyfriend twisting in the wind. Everyone sympathizes with Andy, but don't understand why she continues to allow herself to be abused. Andy knows but is afraid to say it. It is because she wants to be successful. As the movie follows Andy down her career path, we realize that Andy is as fierce and as competitive as Miranda when it comes to her career. Who is the real devil in this movie? Is it Miranda Priestly who knows what she is and plays to win at all costs? Or is it Andy who pretends she has no choice to do what she does to get ahead?

Meryl Streep deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination as the cold, berating, insulting, patronizing, condescending, back-stabbing, anal retentive editor Miranda Priestly. With her asymmetrical silver-haired bob and air of superiority, anyone within 100 feet of her should be both duly impressed and scared. Even when Streep allows the bitch-editor to reveal her humanity, we never feel sorry for her. Why? Because Miranda doesn't want it and you better not give it.

The Devil Wears Prada is a whirlwind of Manhattan scenery, top shelf wardrobes, pretty men, good music, and stunningly beautiful fashion. Half-way through the movie, my eyes were as wide as Andy's black-rimmed doe ones. My heart was in my throat as they flashed the montage of Paris Fashion Weeks' top runway shows. I was envious. It was at that moment that I understood what fashion is as Miranda sees it. It is a fantasy land to the outsiders, and they long to be in the positions of Miranda and Andy.

I tried to read the novelby Lauren Wiesberger in preparation of the film. Reportedly, the book is based on her experiences as Anne Wintour's assistant at Vogue magazine. The book was overwritten, tedious, and exhausting. I lost my patience of wading through for the conclusion at 250 pages with about 100 to go. The movie was significantly retooled, and is a faster and smoother story. The flick was better then the book, so don't read it. See it!",1151712000,3,3117,4.882797731568998
1563831,3,B00005JP0C,"The rarified, oxygen-deprived world of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one in which very few people survive: blood sucking vampires, ravers, drug peddlers and those involved in the Fashion Industry.
Director David Frankel, heretofore most famous for the Woody-Allenish, Sarah Jessica Parker-starring ""Miami Rhapsody,"" does a good job of setting the tone of entitlement and bulimia in his ""The Devil Wears Prada"" which stars a macho, gut crunching and proud to be a *itch Meryl Streep as fashion/lifestyle magazine editor Miranda Priestly and Anne Hathaway as Miranda's intelligent, not interested in fashion but needing a job/ gofer-slave Andy Sachs.
Andy, very much the innocent /stranger in a strange land arrives on Miranda's doorstep as a last resort after graduating from Northwestern University...turned down everywhere else she applies at ""Runway Magazine"" hoping to begin her career in Journalism. Andy is surprisingly (to herself and to us) hired as Miranda's second assistant: a job that everyone tells her ""several 1000 girls would give their eye-teeth for.""
Andy is subjected to a number of humiliating and challenging situations and by whit of her innate intelligence and talent manages to solve and/or survive all.
Streep plays Miranda as if her life depends on it: she is ferocious, haughty, smart and completely dedicated to her job and as Andy comments during the film: ""If Miranda were a man, no one would make a comment about her drive for perfection."" (paraphrase). There is one scene in which Miranda lets her hair down emotionally with Andy but the scene seems contrived to add another tone (a ""female"" one)to Miranda's character. Again the director should have left well enough alone, stuck by his character's basic nature and celebrated the strong, powerful woman that Miranda is.
If only ""TDWP"" as a whole had the steely resolve of Streep's Miranda we might have had an important as well as a mildly amusing film on our hands. But as it is, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a fun but ultimately shallow/missed the opportunity to make an important statement film.",1151625600,43,2076,5.144970414201183
