8131864,3,B000GG4XR4,"When I purchased this for my son, he had went to Sturgis in 1999 but after a bike accident he never returned.  He often wanted to return and this was his one chance.  Unlike most of the bike related videos (Invasion Motorcycles, One Million Motorcycles, ...) This video was poorly constructed from home video footage.  The first disc (the one on Sturgis) attempts to make a documentary, and does a fairly decent job of it.  It is when we travel to the bike rally's in Hollywood and Daytona that it takes a turn for the worse.  Here they do a poor attempt of making an a mixture between a playboy video and an Easy Rider Magazine video.  Which does not work.

The bonus features (which the other reviewer obviously did not look at) includes a slideshow of the bikes at these events, a history of the Harley Davidson motorcycle, Tattoo art, and a wet T-Shirt contest (which can be found at any Bike Rally.)

So why did I give it a 3 star rating?  THE PRICE and a previous bad review!  It is very cheap and Disc 1 is worth watching once or twice.  If you paid $10.00 or more for this, then I can understand the complaint, but I got it used for $1.00.  Cannot beat that.",1278288000,,1166,4.298165137614679
8131865,1,B000GG4XR4,do not waste your time or money with this cheezy 80's crap. it is just a collection of garbage and lameness with some cheezy 80's chicks rubbing themselves while sitting on a bike. it shows about 2 minutes of bikes then launches into this lame video of a chick trying to be hot for 10 minutes. this was hard to sit through. it remided me of something you would find at a dollar store. this went from my dvd player stright into the donation pile.,1251590400,,445,4.247058823529412
