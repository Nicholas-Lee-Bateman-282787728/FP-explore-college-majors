8635134,1,B00HRUQBEK,"I could not stand to hear the voice of Alec Baldwin coming from my TV. Too bad this is probably a great collection. Would you buy any nature set for 1 cent, say if this was narrated by Charles Milles Manson? I am just saying that these documentaries will need to be mindful of who they hire as a narrator. I will never watch this due to Alec Baldwin as the narrator. If they have another narrator, like they had to do with Planet Earth after the Oprah reviews were so poor, they hired Sigourney Weaver as a second narrator.. Many reviews disliked the Oprah version.",1499126400,,565,4.339622641509434
