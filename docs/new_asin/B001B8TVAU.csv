8528141,5,B001B8TVAU,"""3 Little Wonders"" is new entry into the burgeoning early childhood video category is a series of three shorts that focus on stimulating children's primary senses.  The first ""Baby's Stroll Through Nature,""includes lovely, live-action pictures of the flora and fauna that one might see on a nature  walk, with colors so saturated they appear to be watercolor paintings.  Occasionally, viewers catch a glimpse of a baby sneakers peeking out of a stroller but the segment is meant to mimic the perspective that a baby might have as he or she is wheeled along on a family nature walk,  In the second short video, ""Cellos, Bassoons and Musical Toons"" which combines live action and animation, musical instruments become sources of fanciful wonder.
In the last video, ""Wheel Time Express,"" all manner of wheels spin soothingly, including motorcycles, spinning wheels, Ferris wheels, potters wheels, trains and more.  All three segments are accompanied by music both familiar and original.
Each segment focuses on aspects of baby's world that he or she will find delightful. Anne Sherber",1220054400,,1081,5.22543352601156
