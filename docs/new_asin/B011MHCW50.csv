One of the greatest Bond villians played by the late Christopher Lee.

7337408,3,B011MHCW50,"This may have been top of the line for its time, but I don't feel any particular attachment to it just because I grew up with it.  When it comes to Bond, I prefer the modern Daniel Craig/James Bond movies.  This movie would have been better at 90 minutes instead of 2 hours.",1499040000,,274,4.150943396226415

7337410,5,B011MHCW50,"One of my favorite Roger Moore as 007 entries.  This one has all the stuff that makes James Bond such a great film character.  Roger Moore also seems to be more ""engaged"" and less light-hearted in this film but he doesn't disappoint.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.",1496275200,,257,4.666666666666667

7337414,4,B011MHCW50,"It's no coincidence that the best movie from Sean Connery (Goldfinger), Roger Moore (Man With The Golden Gun) and Pierce Brosnan (Goldeneye) during their time as James Bond all have the word Gold in the title. As someone who isn't really a fan of Roger Moore's turn as 007, I particularly like Golden Gun. It seems to fall right into place and employ many of the devices that I have come to love about James Bond.

The intro to this movie is arguably the best of the Moore-era, it perfectly showcases the titular villain and shows us that he is indeed a worthy adversary of our beloved international secret agent. In addition it likely has the strongest villain of any of the Roger Moore adaptations, using Hammer Horror legend Christopher Lee who was perfectly cast and highly valued his role in this film.

There is a clear direction in this film, there isn't too much talking, or too much politicking, or too much planning on either end, there is just a man with a plan and action being taken. I personally consider the 'house of mirrors' finale to be one of the best in the legacy of the franchise, and that is coming from someone who has seen every movie in the series at least twice.

I never understood the apparent disdain for this film by fans of Moore, having played the role more times than anyone gave him a bigger chance to have bad movies (and he did), with that being said ""Man With The Golden Gun"" is practically a diamond in the rough. Because Moore played the role for so long, he was also the oldest actor to ever portray Bond at 57 years old during the time of filming ""A View to a Kill"". It's hard to take a 57 year old man seriously in a role this intense, so to him see perform well in his earlier years with this role is satisfying.

With the exception of the head-scratching attempt at comic relief with the DW scenes, the car jump slide whistle (later heavily regretted by both the composer John Barry and director Guy Hamilton), and some of the kung-fu scenes (which they felt pressured to add because of the growing popularity of Bruce Lee), The Man with the Golden Gun is a solid entry in this very long running espionage film series.

7337424,4,B011MHCW50,Early Bonds tend to be hokey compared to the intense action and elaborate sets from the Daniel Craig vintage shows. The writers are often more careless with the details like gun caliber.,1458345600,,186,4.84375
7337425,4,B011MHCW50,"When you check out ratings for Bond, you get a mixed bag of reviews depending on which actor the reviewer prefers. I like Connery best, but I grew up in the Roger Moore era and he made several good Bond films too. Whether this particular film is good or not is up to you... some people hate this one but it's one of my fav Bond films. I've seen it several times and still like it.

I had the DVD and the BluRay quality is better. The only thing I dislike is navigating the menu, which is too slow and takes too long to load... this is true of all the Bond BluRays. Most of the Bond BluRays go on sale for about $5-7, so it's a good buy.",1455494400,,636,3.9302325581395348
8724635,4,B011MHCW50,"Agent 007 (Roger Moore) learns that hes on the hit list of the world's most expensive assassin, Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). Traveling from Beirut to Macau, China, to Bangkok, Thailand, he aims to confront the assassin while recovering sensitive solar cell equipment. Herv Villechaize is on hand as Scaramangas little assistant, Nick Nack.

The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) was Moores second outing as Bond. He did 7 films for the franchise in 13 years from 1973-1985. Moores stint is my favorite run in the series with all seven films being kinetic, amusing, scenic and just all-around entertaining. Theres not one clunker in the bunch and they were all profitable at the box office, but this one kinda got lost between the cracks of Live and Let Die (1973) and The Spy who Loved Me (1977).

Director Guy Hamilton made three prior Bond films, Live and Let Die, Diamonds are Forever (1971) and Goldfinger (1964), and wanted 007 to be more rough around the edges in this movie, like he is in Ian Flemings book. As such, Moore's acting seems more ""tough here than his other Bond entrees; for instance, the way he treats Andrea (Maud Adams) in the arm twisting scene. But Moore didn't like playing the character this way and toned it down for the rest of his installments.

Theres picturesque Asian globetrotting, with the Thailand islands being particularly scenic (standing in for Red Chinese waters). On the female front, theres Agent Mary Goodnight played by Britt Ekland, who looks great in a floral bikini during the last reel. Theres also the aforementioned Adams as Andrea and a cameo by Chew Mee. Memorable moments include an entertaining martial arts academy sequence; the amusing return of redneck Sheriff JW Pepper (Clifton James), whos vacationing in Bangkok with his wife; a great car-jumping stunt; and Scaramangas secret solar power plant operation.

The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes and was shot in Thailand (Phang Nga Bay and Bangkok) and Hong Kong/ Macau, with additional work done in England.

8724636,3,B011MHCW50,For me this is Moore's weakest Bond film but I don't find it as bad as Diamonds Are Forever or Die Another Day.  Smaller in scale than most of the series but interesting nonetheless thanks to Moore and Christopher Lee being so fun to watch.  As usual with these Blu Rays the sound and picture quality is superior and worthwhile on that basis,1534550400,,341,4.396825396825397
