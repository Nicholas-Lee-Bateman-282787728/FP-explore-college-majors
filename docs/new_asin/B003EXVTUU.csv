8395757,4,B003EXVTUU,"Yes, the tracklist this DVD and CD too are totally false.

This is the right tracklist:
1. Enigma of Desire
2. Traces of a tear
3. Maraba
4. Song To The Pharaoh Kings
5. Song With A View
6. Egyptian Danza/Race With The Devil

I saw this stuff very much places and everywhere is wrong.
This is unbelievable ....",1297814400,,310,4.237288135593221
8395758,3,B003EXVTUU,"I do not know about the DVD but I do have the CD. If the CD is exactly the same as the DVD in terms of song list, then yes, the song titles are terribly mislabeled. After an initial listening, I'm fairly certain that #2 is ""Traces of a Tear,"" #4 is ""Song to the Pharoah Kings,"" and #6 ""Race with the Devil on Spanish Highway"" (also found on Tour De Force Live). Best guesses for #3 is ""Arabella"" and #5 is ""Maraba."" #1 might be as it is on the label ""Beijing Demons."" For #3, #5, and #1, these songs seem to be from the album Tiramisu (which I'm less familiar with so that is why I am less definite about the actual titles of these songs).  When I eventually refamilarize myself to the album Tiramisu, then I might be able to pin down the identity of these other songs a bit better.

Aside from the very annoying misinformation on the actual song list, the performance is truly wonderful (and I am a fan of Al Di Meola). ""Song to the Pharoah King"" is a personal favorite of mine (as I like the Return to Forever versions of this song, so it's a treat to hear an alternate version on this album).  So the rating would be 1 stars for bad information but the overall performance 4-1/2 stars (and I always like live versions of songs) brings up the overall to 3 stars as I can tolerate, a little bit, the bad information to get a great live performance for me to listen to.",1295654400,,1369,4.158490566037736
8395759,4,B003EXVTUU,"After receiving the DVD with much elation and no restraint I tore into the box and threw the disc into the computer
and while waiting for the disc to load, looked at the song titles.  Beijing Demons? Capoeira? Was I going to really
hear these performed live for the first time? The 20 seconds seemed like an eternity!!!! Well, pop goes the wheezel.
I am not sure nowadays, with everyone having access to the internet and being able to verify the authenticity of a
composition how this company managed to reproduce this DVD.  I mean...its false advertising!!! Neither of the above
mentioned songs are on the disc and yet, they are listed in the product description both by Amazon and the manufacturer.
Both Federal Farmer and Guitarguy have done great reviews of the CD of this album which is essentially the DVD without
the video. I still find myself giving it 4 stars because as a Di Meola fan whose favorite two albums are Tirami Su and
Soaring through a dream, it is great to have the performances of some the songs from those albums.  The Videos are all
available on youtube and if you download the basic REAL Player from [...]
, you can download the videos onto your computer
and essentially own the DVD for FREE!!!! Hope this review was helpful for you.  Cheers!",1275436800,6,1268,4.597345132743363
