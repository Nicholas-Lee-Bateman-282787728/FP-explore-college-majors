First, I think it was shot on video and then filmlooked.  This, together with the rather poor special effects, reveal a very modest budget.  I don't want to call it a rip-off of The Omen.  But it travels the same ground without really adding anything new.  Booboo did give a good performance and a few of the other actors managed to be at least adequate. Some of the acting was pretty bad, but this is not unusual with an Asylum film.  The soundtrack was pretty good... all techno, but very well done.  If you like the subject matter you probably won't mind watching the movie... once.",1454630400,,718,4.427480916030534

STORY

After a plane crash where a boy is the only survival, the famous anchor Erika Lawson convinces her husband and cameraman Scott to adopt the child. They bring Donald home and Scott's father Big Jake offers to take care of him while the couple works. However, after a series of bizarre accidents that culminates with the death of Jake, the nanny Lucy Fir comes to the Lawson's home to work. However, Lucy is actually a follower of the Anti-Christ and together with Donald, they bring more tragedies to the Lawson's family. The story is clearly taken from the omen, but it works out really well and keeps you engaged.

ACTING

Decent acting. Lucy fir was a pretty good actress, she was very gorgeous too. The husband Scott was a pretty good actor too. Donald played by Booboo stewart was a very good child actor, some may know him from twilight. The wife Erika was okay, I felt bad for her in the end, I just wish she put a little more emotion into it.

Special effects

Good special effects, though there wasn't really much. The only real special effects were the kill scenes.

VERDICT

I would recommend this if you're an asylum fan, or an exorcism fan. If you have netflix, find some time to watch this, obviously it's a knock off of the omen,, but for a knock off, it pretty damn good. I may even buy this.",1364083200,,1452,4.391791044776119
8123046,5,B000FIHNAW,"Being a fan of Booboo Stewart I had to see this movie, and yes it is not the greatest and has its bad acting moments. Overall it was a really good movie and I thought was just as worthy as any of the Omen flicks. I would recommend it to any fan!!",1353369600,,246,3.75
8123047,5,B000FIHNAW,"Really enjoyed watching 666:The Child alot for me it remind me of a remake of the movie The Omen.
 Boo Boo Stewart played the part of the demon child perfectly. He played the older Damon in this
 I loved watching the nanny who turned out to be 1 of his protectors go nuts trying to protect
 her young master from being killed by his father on the churches altar before he gains his full
 power",1318118400,2,393,4.2
8123048,2,B000FIHNAW,"We had to see this movie, just because we ADORE Booboo Stewart, but honestly, it's a truly horrible film.  Booboo is cute as ever, though, and a decent actor even at 11 years old, so if you're a fan, don't miss it.  Otherwise, skip it altogether.",1271376000,,246,4.326086956521739
8123049,1,B000FIHNAW,"Asylum production that tries to cash in on The Omen. They should show Asylum movies in prison in exchange for reduced sentences, I promise there would be a reduction in crime and far fewer repeat offenders.",1182902400,4,206,4.75
8123050,1,B000FIHNAW,"After seeing a couple of cool Asylum films, like Dead Men Walking, Hide and Creep, and Dracula's Curse, I thought I'd give this one a shot.  Big mistake!!!!!  Lame, lame, lame.  What's the deal with the kid?  He looks more like a fifth Beatle than a demon child.  Acting is really weak.  They managed to lift only the bad parts of the original Omen, skipping the parts that made it a classic.  Don't buy this turkey.  Even the Asylum's Shapeshifter is better than this.  At least that one was so bad, it was funny.  This is just sad.",1150675200,9,533,4.346938775510204
