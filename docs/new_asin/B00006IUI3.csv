1777373,5,B00006IUI3,"do not cheat or make this guy mad, even tho he is blind, he will quickly dispatch you with the best swordwork on film, no walking on air, almost like a japanese western, very entertaining movie",1354665600,,193,4.388888888888889
1777374,5,B00006IUI3,"""On The Road"", the fifth film in the Zatoichi/Blind Swordsman series starring Shintaro Katsu, is one of my favorites and may turn out to be one of yours, too!

For those who are not familiar with the Blind Swordsman films, Zatoichi is a blind man who makes his living as a masseur. In Japan during this period, blindness was perceived as shameful and was looked down upon. Craving respect, Zatoichi (Ichi for short) learns the way of the sword and becomes a Yakuza gangster. He leaves this life behind and wishes only to live in peace. Unfortunately, his skills are so great that someone always wants to hire him or there's someone with an old grudge looking to settle a score with him.

As this film begins, a Yakuza member tries to lure Zatoichi to a town where he will be offered a ""job"" in a gang war. Unfortunately, a member of the rival gang intercepts them, hiring ronin Samurai to kill Ichi and the man with him. Zatoichi easily dispatches the ronin, the man traveling with him is killed, but he makes two new enemies in the process. As Zatoichi goes his way once more he is soon embroiled in another conflict. He stumbles across a dying man guarding a young woman being hunted by Samurai. He promises the man to take the young woman to safety and, in the process, becomes hunted by Samurai.

I don't do ""spoilers"" so I'll stop there. Needless to say, the story revolves around Zatoichi's intense sense of honor and compassion for the weak and helpless. He shows nothing but disdain for those with wealth and power who misuse their positions or stations in society. Once the promise has been made, Zatoichi will let nothing stop him.

Zatoichi is blind and that is what makes these films wonderful to watch. The viewer is constantly surprised that, even though deprived of sight, Ichi's other senses are more developed and little escapes his attention. He is able to fight even though he cannot see with his eyes and that is part of the mystique of the ""blind swordsman"". Shintaro Katsu is a fine actor and portrays Ichi as a man of honor and compassion but with his own hopes and dreams - including the desire for love.

The action sequences are quite good and Ichi has his own unorthodox fighting style - very different from the Yakuza gangsters or Samurai. Swordsmanship, as one can imagine, is emphasised in these films and this one is no exception. This film has so many things: honor, compassion, action and adventure, subtle comedy and even a romantic element.

I know these films are in Japanese with subtitles, but for the viewer who ""gets it"", he/she will be hooked! This is a fine film and deserves five stars.",1344124800,3,2629,4.6068376068376065
1777375,5,B00006IUI3,"A beautiful film and engaging story. I cannot recommend the whole series enough. The just do not make films like this any more. If you are remotely interested in Japanese cinema or samurai films, go ahead and buy this DVD. It will not disappoint.",1198800000,,246,4.613636363636363
1777376,4,B00006IUI3,"What do you expect from a blind swordsman?  The plot is a bit confusing, the girl pretty, Zatoichi clever, the swords sharp - what more do you want?",1187222400,,148,4.285714285714286
1777377,4,B00006IUI3,"""You switched the dice, I can tell by the sound,"" says Ichi to the gambler opposite him: and with a quick flash from his cane-sword, the 5th entry to the Zatoichi series opens up. They just keep on getting better. While being led to Doyoma, as an invited guest, Ichi and his escort are ambushed by a group on 'goons' hired to kill him. This motley group of killers have been hired by yakuza thug Jingoro [Ryuzo Shimada]. Jingoro works for the Boss, Tobei [Sonosuke Sawamura]. And once again Ichi finds himself fighting the ""bad-guys.""

Zatoichi encounters a dying man on the road, who asks Ichi to save his daughter and take her to Edo. The daughter, Mitsu [Shiho Fujimura] is from a very wealthy family and is wanted by yakuza thugs who hope to ransom her. Moreover, a corrupt yakuza lord states that Ichi has been paid to fight for him, and this brings a price on Ichi's head [what else is new?] Therefore, Ichi now has many yakuza thugs after him. And still, he must get Mitsu to Edo. Mitsu goes through all sorts of trauma amongst the various factions out to claim her for the money--and it is up to Zatoichi to see that she arrives in Edo in one piece.

Can Ichi save the girl? Will she ever arrive at Edo? This 5th entry of the Zatoichi entry makes for a delightful watch. The cinematography is outstanding, the characters Ichi faces are as devious as ever, and Zatoichi continues his remarkable display of swordsmanship in this very entertaining episode of ""ZATOICHI: ON THE ROAD."" Highly recommended, this is a very good episode of the Zatoichi series.",1157328000,2,1560,4.567857142857143
1777378,5,B00006IUI3,"I was a little hesitant about buying this dvd. I have watched samurai movies in the past but found them too slap stick, boring or dramatic with the only good parts being the fight scenes. But never the less once I popped in the dvd and watched the first 10 minutes, I was hooked. The story lines are basically the same but make no mistake these are good quality movies. The directors do a great job in balancing the right amount of humor, fight scenes and acting dialogues so the movies are never boring and they are quite funny. Shintaro Katsu is a ""natural"" in these films and I would highly recommend any other Zatochi films with him in it.",1118361600,33,643,4.366666666666666
1777379,5,B00006IUI3,"Let me say this, I saw my first Zatoichi movie back when I was 14 and since then I was absolutely hooked.
 The move was beautifully done and I can not stress enough what an awesome character Shintaro Katsu can play. I have all of his VHS tapes and I am slowing starting to build my DVD collection. I have DVD's from overseas subtitled and let me tell you.
It invokes a feeling that no one anywhere, time, or place can in this day and age. The movies are genre films (Feeling invoking). DO you remember the first time you saw seven, primal fear, titanic - (kind of cheesy now) but at the time the movies gave you a feeling right.
 Well all of his movies are like that. This one here is 1 of my top 10's! 5 out of 5. He has over 30 movies made and also 100's of TV episodes. Trust me on this. Its great. Once you get hooked you'll love it as much as me. BUT BEWARE YOU HAVE TO ENJOY FILM> If those action packed rockem sockem's are your only cup of tea then not for you.",1039564800,17,968,3.984536082474227
1777380,5,B00006IUI3,"A great entry into the Zatoichi series, there are some awesome fight sequences in this movie and it is very in depth and relfective.  All the Zatoichi films I've seen start off without much action, focusing more on building an enviroment that is beleivable and a story that is captivating.  Masseur Ichi on the Road satisfies on all levels, truly a testament of what a film should be- an art form that draws the watcher into its carefully laid out story and has him emerge feeling enlightened.  With all the hollywood trash being released nowadays all people want is a quick fix of special effects and shallow romance scences.  A good story is no longer a necessity and is a nearly forgotten art.  The Zatoichi series reminds us what film making is really about.",1021680000,26,762,4.656716417910448
7969443,3,B00006IUI3,"It is an interesting movie of a talented man that has had to overcome remarkable adversity in his life through disciplined training.

7969444,5,B00006IUI3,Love old Zatoichi movies and this is the first.,1488672000,,47,4.333333333333333
7969445,4,B00006IUI3,"Zatoichi (Shintaro Katsu) becomes the protector of a young woman (Shiho Fujimura) who is trying to get home to her family in Edo after stabbing a local lord in self-defense.  Intrigue surrounds them as unscrupulous samurai attempt to kidnap her to collect the reward and two warring bosses (Yoshio Yoshida and Sonosuke Sawamura) attempt to enlist Ichi in their struggle.

Katsu has really settled into his most famous role by this point in the series.  He is sometimes fearsome, sometimes comedic, and sometimes rather sweet-natured.  Ichi always seems to fall in love in these films and in this one we can see the exact moment he loses his heart through Katsus nuanced performance.  Of course, a love story is not the primary reason for watching a samurai film, and this one doesnt stint on the action or the surprising plot twists.  Throw in the beautiful photography and you have a complete entertainment.",1470787200,,908,4.940789473684211
