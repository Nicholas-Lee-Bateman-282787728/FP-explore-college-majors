1551712,4,B00005JO16,"George Romero's newest zombie epic is obviously the product of big studio backing.  The raw and threadbare quality of the earlier films is nowhere to be found here.  The film is glossy and that sometimes works to its detriment.  The premise is very interesting (basically, contracted purveyors scour the countryside in search of supplies to sustain a city-as-compound, all while trying to evade the walking dead, which now out number the living and, ultimately, what happens when social/cultural differences become a destructive mechanism), as is the post-apocalyptic class system (Mr. Romero is one of the cleverest,  social commentators to stand behind the camera) and the touches of humor, so prevalent in the earlier films, are still very much present.  The gore level is the highest I've encountered in a long time and at the risk of offending the Fangoria subscribers, which are legion, is gratuitous beyond words.  It's not that I was either offended or disgusted by anything I saw, but I was, however, taken aback by the excessiveness of it all.  The clever dismemberment quotient was taken to an all time high, with everything from spring board heads tethered to the body by a strand of flesh, to the drawbridge decapitation, to the silhoutted arm given the human wish bone treatment, to the countless zombie crushings all courtesy of Dead Reckoning, etc.  At first it's nostalgic, one hour later it's just plain irritating.  Something working in the film's favor is the idea of the evolution of the zombies from shuffling, mindless, eating machines, to beings with a sense of recall and memory and developing motor skills and something working against it was the lead zombie's constant howling-as-command; that was a royal mistep and in the end only manages to detract. Nevertheless, in the hands of a lesser experienced (and talented) director, that could have proven to be a death trap, but Mr. Romero's talents (the aforemtinoned howling notwithstanding) keeps it reigned in pretty tightly and doesn't allow it to become a parody of itself.  Dennis Hopper is his usual wooden self (the man is incapable of registering any emotion) and the rest of the cast was seemingly into the fun of it all, especially John Leguizamo.  Simon Baker was somewhat detached, but he is, after all, playing the ultimate cynic and self-preservationist.  Ms. Argento, however, left me cold, alas and no amount of cleavage and tattoos can make her believable as hooker turned zombie hunter.  The premise of the film, as a whole works and the sum is, ultimately, greater than its parts but I still feel a little restrain and more fleshed out (no pun intended) characters could have elevated the film from a mere summer sequel into a worthy addition to the Romero zombie franchise.  All in all, not bad, but far from great.  It is better than ""Day of the Dawn"" in my opinion, the worst of the series.  Yes, the special effects are beyond reproach and the production values are also first rate and if that is primarily your reason for going to the movies, then you'll find no flaws here.",1119571200,2,3074,4.928294573643411
1551713,4,B00005JO16,"No one on this planet likes Dawn of the Dead 78' more than I do. I also become glued to the tube if Night appears on the  screen. I honestly didn't really like the overacted, underfunded Day of the Dead.

  This new addition had a ton of expectations going in and sometimes that can lead to let down. If you don't like spoilers you have no buisness on this board. Here are some positives:

1 opening scene where zombies are being zombies. Setting, mood, and makeup are all incredible.

2 Great acting throughout. Not one scene I would have redone due to acting flaws.

3 Casting perfectly done. I like all the people and most of the zombies.

4 Phenomenal camera angles. None can outdo George in this department.

5 Great special effects. NO flaws found.

6 Liquor store scene was tipical great zombie fair

Drawbacks:

1 I didn't buy a ticket to see RoadWarrior or Dukes of Hazzard.

2 I never, never, never, never want to see zombies that can talk. The grunting commands made me sick to my stomach.

3 Lead zombie didn't act like a zombie, look like a zombie, or sound like a zombie.

4 I never, never, never want to watch a zombie GIVE another zombie a gun.

5 Why aren't these zombies afraid of fire like in both NOTLD.

6 If zombies eat flesh above all else, why are zombies leaving at the end.

7 Why not shoot the zombies that just ate the people you came to save?

8 Lead zombie was horrible.

9 NO CLOWN ZOMBIES PLEASE!

10 Far worst ending in any ROmero flick. You cant have a happy ending in a zombie movie!",1119571200,2,1518,4.293286219081272
1551714,4,B00005JO16,"It just feels rushed!!  93 minutes is not long enough for a Romero masterpiece!  I eagerly await the 140+ minute directors cut that I am sure is in the works.  That said... this is one heluva zombie flick and stacks up well with the others in the series.  Superior acting (hopper is great), extensive gore(old school style!!YES), campy script, sweet FX, what more can you ask for?  I can see some NOTLD hardliners being a bit disappointed at the ending or, perhaps, the overall tone of the film(zombies with souls?), BUT...folks this is one mean, bloody, smart, proud zombie movie!!

1551715,5,B00005JO16,"I've read several reviews for Land of the Dead in the past week. Some praised it, while some dismissed it as a ""rehash"" or ""uninspired"" film, saying it does nothing to further the Romero legacy. I've heard it's not funny. I've heard it's character's sucked. I've heard lots. I'm here to let you know that Romero's new addition not only fits like a glove to the original three - it's hillarious, well acted, well concieved, and looks beautifully-dirty at that!

When I hear people say LAND is ""unoriginal"", it makes me chuckle. No other horror filmmaker can mix social commentary, humor, and gore like Romero, and if there is one out there, he'she probablly got the idea from Romero anyway!

I saw LAND last night, at a midnight show here in Chicago. From the opening old-school UNIVERSAL logo, to watching KAUFMAN say things like ""We don't negoitate with terrorists,"" to watching a population of zombies appear from under the water in what, to me, is one of the creepiest moments I've felt in a looooong time, I not only thouroughly enjoyed this flick, I welcome it WHOLEHEARTEDLY as an instant classic.

The underlying story is a cautionary one - just like Night, Dawn, and Day. It's shows a population that have locked themselves in, so much so that when it comes time to escape, they can't. It tells of a ruthless leader that keeps the outside population occupied with drugs, sex and entertainment to keep their minds from coming together and storming Fiddler's Green. The Green is a skyscraper-fortress that Kaufman and his cronies have turned into a new city, one that holds every memory of the former life - shopping malls, gyms, movies, etc. This film is about zombies, obviously. But like every Romero films before, it's also about our post 9-11 world, living in fear, isolating ourselves in a big world, and so much more. The effects are UNMATCHED. I didn't notice ANY CGI throughout the whole thing. There were a couple puppets, and they looked amazing.

Overall, this is one BIG ASS THUMBS up for a long awaited flick. The end caused pause initially. I felt it could have been better. However, I wake up this morning and rethink everything in my head and I'm satisfied. It wraps the microscopic story up like a lovely package, leaving the macroscopic problem wide open.

Loved it.

1551716,3,B00005JO16,"Mediocre movie.. This movie seemed to be more like the remake of 'dawn of the dead' and a lot less like 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Day of the Dead'. Too much plot, not enough sheer zombie killing. Also, they seemed to make this movie a bit humerous. I'm not sure if that detracted from the overall theme of the movie though.

1551801,4,B00005JO16,"I sat for about 5 mins trying to figure out whether to give this movie 3 or 4 stars, but in the end, my devotion to George Romero's Living Dead series prevailed (Night being my all time favorite film EVER since I first saw it at 6 years old) and I gave the 4. These days, it's all mainstream... Walking Dead, World War Z, Zombieland... if it's not straight up horror comedy (which I DESPISE as much as romantic comedy), it's still not scary or horror in the least bit. NOTLD was total terror; Romero's Living Dead films were works of horror, and the modern day zombie movie is assembly line, regurgitated cookie-cutter crap with weak plots and even weaker characters.

Now as for this movie, it is definitely entertaining as hell in a horror/adventure sense, but it has its fair share of lame parts and ideas. For example, I like the idea of the undead recollecting their previous lives and becoming ""aware"" of each other, ideas that were touched upon slightly with Bub in Day of the Dead. And the premise of having a city barricaded off in (my hometown, the horror capital [well not really]) Pittsburgh offered up a really interesting storyline... playing off the setting, the suspense and horror were very fresh. The characters had depth (although Charlie was terribly annoying and I never could stand Leguizamo), the action was good, fast pacing, and a fair level of terror.

Now the cons... the dialogue is a problem... one of my biggest pet peeves in any movie is poorly written and badly executed exposition. A perfect example is Charlie asking why the fireworks are called ""sky flowers""... now how many times has that group went out for supplies using the fireworks? You'd think he would know WHY they were called that by now, but he says it to explain to the audience. After 4 decades in film, I'd hope Romero could come up with a more subtle way to explain plot points without being so direct. When dialogue gets cheesey, it starts to detract from the integrity of the movie... in this case, it takes away the ""horror"" from the ""horror movie"" and gives it too much comedy. The thing I loved about NOTLD is that there wasn't a single funny line in the entire film. And that's exactly what a horror film should be... HORROR. Most all characters play their roles well with the notable exceptions being Robert Joy (Charlie) and Asia Argento being the two big offenders (godawful dialogue) and ""Pilsbury"" since the few lines he has all being bad. Normally a movie will have a single character as the comic relief (and when it's supposed to be a horror movie, I think ONE is too many), but most of the main characters are comic relief in this one.

All in all, with dialogue being the main problem, this movie is good; I would give it a solid ""B"" if I had to rate it on an A-F scale. I really enjoyed Diary (B-) and Survival being the worst of the series (C-), but I can't bring myself to include those in the series timeline. Land is a good, solid conclusion to the original story. The bleak atmosphere of the world they created holds up against the original 3. Simon Baker essentially carries the entire film with the zombies being the other most interesting part of the cast. I don't watch this one as much as the original trilogy, but I still thoroughly enjoy it when I do.",1484611200,,3280,4.537162162162162
1551802,5,B00005JO16,"This is one of the best Zombie films I have seen. Then again I liked Romero's Day of the Dead and thought that Diary was pretty good too. I rewatched Romero's Dawn of the Dead and couldn't see what I saw it in many years ago.

This one has good action and acting. Dennis Hopper is a trip in any role. The idea that the zombies are learning was kind of funny, but there was enough tension to make it interesting. A few of the deaths were scary and hilarious at the same time. I also liked the rivalry going on between the hero and anti hero.

This film makes my shortlist of great zombie films. If you liked any of these you will like this.

1551865,5,B00005JO16,"Today I had the pleasure to meet Eugene Big Daddy Clark from Land of the Dead at the Windsor Christmas Comic Con 4. Mr. Clark is absolutely one of the nicest celebrities that Ive ever had the pleasure to meet. I had a chance to talk to him about his character in Land of the Dead and what it was like to work on a George A. Romero film. He signed two 11x17 Land of the Dead collage photos for me and took the time to take several pictures with me as well. Mr. Clark was as cordial and gracious as could be and a real pleasure to meet. This is one day I won't forget.

George A. Romeros Land of the Dead unrated directors cut has taken the zombie genre to new heights. These are not your old fashions zombies that youve been accustomed to over the years. In Land of the Dead the zombies have begun to organize themselves and theyve learned how to utilize ordinary tools into weapons. The world is in chaos but somehow a city has been able to fortify itself against the hordes of walking dead roaming outside its wired fences and concrete walls. The city is controlled by a group of callous individuals who live high on the hog atop the city in a skyscraper. A new society has been built but do they have what it takes to defend it against the gathering forces of the undead? The survival of the city and its citizens is at stake and a group of heavily armed mercenaries is called in to protect the city at all costs. Will the highly trained mercenaries be able to stop whats coming? Youll have to buy your own copy to find out!

Video 4/5
Land of the Dead comes to Blu-ray with a rather impressive 1080p, 2.35:1 framed transfer. Colors are excellent throughout the film, even in the darker sequences. Black levels are solid and consistent throughout the film as well. Image detail is about as solid and consistent as can be throughout the film. The video image presented on this Blu-ray is outstanding to say the least. Most of the scenes, simply jump out at the viewer. I couldn't find anything wrong with the video transfer at all. As for the level of gore. Fans will be treated to plenty of gore in classic Gormero fashion, youll have to pardon the little play on words. In my opinion, every vibrant drop of blood, severed limb and torn out piece of human flesh are clearly on display throughout the movie.

Audio 4.5/5
From the moment this movie started, I knew is was in for an audio treat. The audio soundtrack is listed as a DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack and it absolutely rocks! The DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound is full and powerful from the opening credits until the very end. The musical score and sound effects have never sounded better in my opinion. To my ears, the dialogue was clean and crisp throughout and I couldn't hear anything wrong with it. This is one loudest soundtracks Ive ever played thru my sound system and every blood curdling scream was music to my ears!

I just have to comment as an empiricist. Did you ever hear the one about the Chinese walking four at a time past some point, and they supposedly would never stop because they would breed just as fast? Doesn't work out that way. Do the math and even today it would take a good while maybe ten years, but they would run out eventually.

Do the Zombie math. We have automatic weapons, flame throwers, flame-throwing tanks, daisy cutters, nuclear weapons and most of those since the second World War. Something like the Zombie Apocalypse - the ridiculousness aside - would be over in 48 to 72 hours at most. So these movies may be fun, but you do have to suspend belief in more than one way.",1422921600,,858,4.493589743589744

The movie series has somehow evolved with the zombies being smarter. The are acting more human and learning again. They are no longer mindless killing machines, but have a leader zombie and follow his orders. The leader zombie has a gun and is teaching other zombies how to kill people more efficiently than just eating them.

For the human element we focus on attention on Riley and his people that he works with. He is just a work dog that works for the man. The man is in control of everything. He has all the money and power, but that will soon change. Riley wants to get out and live his life no more in the city. He just want to drive away to Canada or somewhere, where there is no zombies.

Riley will get his chance at a new life, when the horde of smart zombies come and destroy the city. It seems like the zombie leader is mad at the humans because they came to his town and destroy and killed a lot his zombie friends. So now, the leader has come to destroy the man's city and kill his people.

In the end, I thought this is great. Good finish to end the series. There no nudity period. It just all about the zombies, killing the man, and Riley getting his freedom.",1421452800,,1408,4.203703703703703

I bought this as a gift for my fiance, but this will also help to complete our ""Of the Dead"" collection.  We have Night, Day, Dawn, Diary and Survival and plenty of their remakes too, but for some reason we never owned this one.

I enjoyed this one for the aspect of what life was like for these people well into the zombie apocalypse, what corrupted people and how the classes were divided even though the world had ended.  Romero loves putting social commentary into his ""Of the Dead"" films and the message throughout this film was rather clear.

There's also a cameo by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (Hopefully that's not a spoiler for you) but if you blink, you'll miss it!

Seeing it at the end of 2014 means that I have seen many films and tv shows along the same bloody lines over the past year or so; in that context, I found nothing new and nothing of much significance compared to its many predecessors (including those issued earlier by Romero. For others who have seen a good sampling of those earlier films, I would stick with the rating. There is nothing new here, nothing dramatically striking  compared to what has gone before. On the other hand, for those new to the genre, it should carry a four star rating; it is not the equal of many but still is a good introduction to the kind of things that go on in this type of film. Nobody stands out in the cast, with the only name that I know, Dennis Hopper, doing a routine job as the wealthy magnate who holds power in the City of the Living which becomes the target of the living dead who are in the very first stages of beginning to think.",1414972800,,1142,4.2626728110599075

1552108,4,B00005JO16,"George A Romero's  "" Land of the Dead"" (2005) is  his first zombie  movie of a ComeBack Trio that he Produced/Directed in the 21st Century. The other two were ""Diary of the Dead"" (2008)( Great-Movie)  & "" Survival of the Dead"" (2009)(Crap Movie).  It is my favourite of the 3 above. It is well acted: Simon Baker - The Mentalist, Dennis Hopper, & John Leguizamo. It has a good suspenseful plot. The last of Humanity is holed up in a  seemingly impenetrable city. As in any society there are social classes, problems,inequality,trials & tribulations, treachery , hope & despair  within the city  But there is a new spin on  traditional zombie flicks, in this movie. The  Ravenous Zombie Hordes  outside the city sanctuary are starting to evolve and are becoming smarter! & Hence more dangerous to mankind!  Will any remnants of humanity survive in the climatic battle? Land of the Dead is a gud movie,. Especially in BlueRay,HD & and on a 40+ inch flatscreen tv. and @ $8 (US) blueray version it is worth it. I have watched it 6 times since it came out in 2005, & never tire of the plot & jump scares!
If you like Geoge A Romero movies you shld check out his (1978) ""Dawn of The Dead""- His Finest work & One of the best Zombie Flicks Ever!!!!!!!!  Romero's (1985) ""Day of the Dead"" is a gud zombie flick & worth checking out aswell.",1412812800,,1331,4.473029045643154

1552111,4,B00005JO16,"George A. Romero's ""Land of the Dead"" is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me since I really tend to enjoy zombie movies. This one is quite watchable and has a fair amount of action, humor, and just tons of zombies.

No spoilers from me: the movie is set around one of the last functioning cities where the rich have setup a decent life for themselves in a luxury high-rise, supported by everyone else trying to escape the zombies and scratch out a living anyway they can. Raiding outside the city for useful items is one way to get ahead, but the it hard to be upwardly mobile when there are so few open spots in the only place worth living. The action is quite good and there is an interesting spin on the way these zombies act.

This is worth watching if you like zombie flicks!

That's the gist of the plot. Most of the characters are stereotypes...Baker as the hero tired of killing, Dennis Hopper as the relentless tycoon  living safe in the city's core and running everything, John Leguziamo as the second-in-command playing both ends against each other. How they handle their roles is what makes it different. The injection of a smattering of actual reasoning evolving inside zombie brains brings about the turning point in the story. If zombies are no longer mindless, how long will it take them to become intelligent enough to gain the upper hand? What happens then?

That question isn't answered but it poses a new threat the hero leaves for everyone else to answer...with a glimmering of a possible truce somewhere on the cinematic.",1402185600,,1022,4.890173410404624

The human actors are purely trope, say cheesy lines and act exactly as expected.
It is only a little different from other zombie movies in that you see an elite maintaining an illusion of normality with black butlers and shopping despite the billions of dead outside.

1552172,5,B00005JO16,"Fraught with plenty of obvious social commentary, Land of the Dead literally pits the have-nots against the haves (led by a regally sedate `boss' Dennis Hopper as Paul Kaufman).  With the wolves (zombies) nipping at their heels, the have-nots are desperate to take refuge with the haves in a glorious high-rise called Fiddler's Green.  Alas, Dennis Hopper's character thinks otherwise.  The rabble needs to stay outside.  Toss into this mix of unrest an uppity wannabe (John Leguizamo as Cholo DeMora), who angrily wants to be a tad more than just a provider of food and nonessentials to the rich and powerful, and you have the makings of a full scale war of uncivil disobedience.  It doesn't help that the zombies have learned how to cooperate, and have coalesced into an unstoppable force of rage.
I love movies about class warfare, especially when there's no clear distinction between the two factions involved.
Happily, there's loads of gore throughout (sadly, as most of this film takes place at night, darkness tends to diminish the effect making it almost pointless).  I do appreciate the attempt though.",1390176000,,1111,5.043715846994536

1552228,5,B00005JO16,"land of the dead shows us that george a. romero is as witty and potent as ever.  this flick seems to be the subject of pretty mixed feelings, and seems only to add to the frequently revisionist opinions people--even horror fans (chioke!)--have of this grand old master.  a horror movie, an action movie, a typical romero grand allegory, and above all else, an exercise in intestines-eating, land of the dead is smart and fun, and belongs just behind romero's best efforts.

ostensibly, land of the dead finds it's place in romero's dead saga (no longer a trilogy!) as an allegory for class:  you have the have's of fiddler's green living up on high without a care in the world, while their have not labor lives just on the outskirts of the cushy ivory tower, living lives of vice and danger, though not quite full on zombie danger.  and once again, everyone seems to be able to agree upon one thing: the soulless, undead are everyone's cannon fodder...and entertainment.  it's interesting that throughout dawn and day and land, the dead are treated with increasing disrespect and derision.  who cares. right? they're just re-animated corpses with an insatiable lust for human flesh.  or are they?

and here is where land takes another vital step in the evolution of zombie film, and it is also why romero is king.  while night simply introduced us to this plague, we did get little glimpses of what was to come: karen seemingly really had it in for her mom, and delighted in garden troweling her to death.  of course dawn is an entire meditation on being driven by vestigial living impulses, as the movie is somewhat about the dead, in lieu of bodies to munch on, eventually drifting their way back to the mall for some shopping.  i remember when gaylen ross is standing by a large plate glass window, staring at the zombie gal on the other side.  You just know she's thinking ""she's me.""  and then day gave us bub, the most sympathetic and well-performed monster since karloff played frankenstein's creation, and we saw that zombies not only could learn, but they could care.  and why shouldn't they?  If you can eat, you have want, and if you have want, well, at some point, you might want something besides food.

so, while the humans play out their cute little class war, the zombies are mobilizing.  big daddy is tired of watching his fellow ""stenches"" stare stupidly at sky flowers (fireworks) and then get mowed down by greedy humans who are raiding the towns for supplies.  big daddy has had enough and together with his top lieutenants, partially-eaten-off-face softball player and white-faced-cleaver-carrying butcher, they mobilize an increasingly large army of the undead to lead an assault on fiddler's green.  inevitably--and satisfyingly--the rich do get eaten.

the characters in land are excellent, starting with simon baker as riley.  he's cool, calm, and in charge, and like many of romero's central protagonists, has a desire to do things the right way, even when the world has fallen apart around him.  asia argento is at her best, physical and funny, and she is the perfect partner to baker.  the always professional robert joy, considerably more likeable then in aja's remake of the hills have eyes, plays charlie, the lennie to baker's george.  charlie, burnt and simple minded, is an expert marksperson with a canine level of loyalty to riley.  the trio is easy to root for.  john leguizamo is having fun as cholo, running his own agenda and trying to move-up in the world, to buy a seat in fiddler's green.  standing in his way is denis hopper, doing his denis hopper thing, as the douchebag who runs the green.  mention must be made of the powerful eugene clark as big daddy, unhappy accepting the status of zombies, and very much and seeking ascension.

romero's camera is as dependable as ever, giving us some really nice night shots, especially in the first town the plunderers decide to hit.  additionally, the scene where the zombies take a bit of a leap in order to make the final push to fiddler's green, is also nicely done.  i just don't think romero gets enuf credit for his scene composition: everyone is blocked nicely, and the picture is big and full.  romero is--and always has been--technically proficient in my mind, and he augments his typical jaunts through fable and allegory with a clear, interesting picture.

as my wife asked, with each decision made by a zombie, if they can think and feel, then, what's the difference?  they're just like us.  exactly, I said.  romero blade runnered us, and did it but good.  they're us, just a different aspect.  and after you've watched them eat and kill and mutilate, that realization becomes pretty ****ing unsettling, y'know?  and typically, as we see the basest of human behaviors, being a zombie often seems preferable in the end.",1384819200,,4821,4.817518248175182

For me, a huge fan of the Dead series, this movie ends the legacy perfectly.  The Blu-ray is close to demo material.  Blacks are inky and deep, highlights pop but don't bloom, color saturation and balance are perfect, and resolution and sharpness are great.

1552374,1,B00005JO16,"Meh...... where do you start...???

I was SO looking forward to the release of this on DVD but was SO disappointed once I started watching.

Most of the 1 stars have covered the problems I had with this so pointless to re-hash them.

The only things I will state is that for me the biggest hoot was the bloke holding Dennis Hopper to ransom for millions of dollars or he'll shell the City with rockets from his armoured camper van.....err....and spend it where exactly...?? After holding them to ransom they are hardly going to welcome him into the fold....(perhaps he needed the paper for the camper van's on board s***ter).

Other issues include -

Guys looting through throngs of zombies on motorbikes or in doorless Jeeps....??!!!
People are living in Fiddlers Green like it was just another day in the financial district complete with Muzak playing in the background..... hmm sure......all whilst the 'poor' folk are living in shanty towns outside.
Thinking zombies that can use tools and (almost) communicate verbally with actions.
The flip top head zombie that clearly has had it's head severed at the spine both walking around and managing to bite someone
The 'chunky' Samoan (AKA - Pilsbury) and pint sized girl (AKA - Motown.... sigh, what's with the silly nick names as there are many more) and crew are supposed to be the best on offer to stop the impending shelling of the city...??? come on.
Zombies don't appear around corners or in buildings until someone need to be bitten....... this is always lame (many other movies are lazy and predictable in this way).
People having their picture taken with a couple of chained zombies and chucking the woman into the zombie fighting cage was the final nail in the coffin for me as it became ridiculous.

Oh, and lastly (as I'm not sure it's been mentioned) I had a feeling it was going to be poor when the zombie musicians at the beginning (in the band stand) were able to blow trombones and trumpets (albeit poorly).......eh..??!!

On a positive note (there are so few).... zombie make up looks good as always in a Romero as is the scoffing folk in gory detail and there are a few genuinely chilling moments such as the zombies all surfacing in the water and walking to shore.

Worth seeing if your a fan of both zombies and Romero (just don't expect too much) but following this and the even poorer Diary I didn't even bother with the Survival one.

The military defenders of the city are inept and more stupid than the brain dead zombies, certainly as stupid as Romero. The zombies finally penetrate towards the heart of the city, an opulent building/mall where all the decadent capitalist exploiters live and they eat the rich (something a Marxist once advocated in the US during the Seventies). You got all the cliches there; at the end, the exploiting capitalist (Dennis Hopper) gets killed by a combination of the black leader of the proletariat zombies AND a representative of the city's underclass (Mexican) as Hopper (the WASP) tries to leave the mayhem with bags of money (just what is he going to do with it? put it in a Swiss bank account?). An explosion occurs and Hopper dies and the money is burnt. Justice prevails. Towards the end, the black proletariat zombie and the working class hero cross paths, but they go their separate ways in dignity, with respect towards each other.

I like this zombie movie, because they were not just lifeless drooling idiots. They seemed to still have knowledge of who they were and their occupation. These zombies were smart and taking over. Since, I have only seen this one I have more of an uninfluenced opinion. I liked the concept. Of course, the story line could have been tighter. Then again who are we kidding we just watch to see the special effects and make-up, as well as, to see who is the last person standing.",1342656000,,613,4.433628318584071
1552379,3,B00005JO16,"I'm sure that somewhere, George Romero discusses or explains why it took him 20 years to get back to a franchise that has never suffered from lack of fans.  It may be that he simply wanted to do something else with his life, or it could be that he was afraid he could never top the success of his previous films.  Even if it isn't the primary reason, I'll always wonder if fear of competing with himself didn't play at least a tiny part.  That, and dealing with people's expectations.

What's interesting to me is that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00005B1YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>, which I consider his best, are as different as night and, well, dawn I guess, even though both are dealing with zombies.  Almost unbelieveably, in retrospect, Romero was able to make frightening films and social points at the same time.  The point is that he set the bar incredibly high with those two, and I think we fans expect each new installment to top the last.  I'm not sure that's possible, since a large part of the first two movie's success were simply because they came out of nowhere.  They were complete surprises.

I like every movie I've seen of Romero's, some just better than others.  Land Of The Dead has its moments, but it certainly seems less than average compared to the first two 'Dead' films.  I don't even think its as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead</a>, other than in its star power and production value.  The idea that the zombies are beginning to acquire a smattering of intelligence, and, in very rudimentary ways, begin to show emotions such as empathy and pity for their fellow undead doesn't seem logical given the premise of the films, nor does it seem to serve any larger commentary on our own society.  It really seems more like a Deus ex Machina in order to bring the remaining humans, forced to live in a guarded compound, into conflict with the undead and at the same time upset the new social structure that has developed since the fall of civilization.

That new social structure DOES seem to be Romero's overall point; a commentary about the elite (as represented by Dennis Hopper), and the commoners (Leguizamo and Baker).  Even that is strained though - Hopper and his power partners are in place because of the amount of money they have, but given the parameters of the movie, would paper money really have that sort of power?

I think there are a lot of problems like these that plague this movie, but, on the other hand, it's still a pretty good zombie film.  All the requisite effects and shocks are present.  I just don't think that there is any technique or story innovation that any director can spring on us that is going to top Romero's first two efforts or Lucio Fulci's masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B0060GUV2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>.  We may get films that come close or that are still entertaining, but, sadly, without essentially changing the genre into something else, we're going to be left with pale imitations.

This movie did not blow me away on first viewing. It certainly fits into the lexicon of Romero zombie movies, it's set in the same world but at first glance it seems to lack something. Maybe it's something to do with your expectation of a Romero zombie movie.

The story picks up a survivor community which is great divided. There are the rich and powerful, safely in their great tower, living life as normal. Then, there are the masses, cowering in a shanty town around the security of the tower - living pretty much at a medieval level.

The main characters in the story are involved in the frequent raids out into the surrounding countryside to get supplies and luxuries. These missions are dangerous but who knows, do enough and you might snag a place in the tower...

I won't include any spoilers in this review but you can imagine the tension around the settlement and things come to head when the `class warfare' once more raises its ugly head. Someone thinks they've done enough to buy a place in the tower, only to find the doors closed to his `kind'....

Enter our hero and his team, including a hooker, a burnt man and an amazing armoured truck known as Dead Reckoning.

1552444,2,B00005JO16,"If there is one thing I have learned watching all these end of the world and zombie apocalypse movies then it is that I would be worried about other human beings just as much as I would be about the end of the world. One would think that with the world having come to an end and plagued by flesh eating animated corpses, human beings would rise above the occasion, drop all the pettiness, greed and hate and band together. But not so, as apparently apocalypse or not, humans somehow still seem to manage to rival, and sometimes even outdo, the zombies in terms of evil and cruelty. This is where Land of the Dead is set.

It is the world several years after the zombie take over and the few remaining humans have barricaded themselves in a part of the city. Those rich and powerful enough (how?) have moved into a high rise they turned into a small living city with all the luxuries you can imagine, while the rest is on the cold streets, barely eeking by.  The ""rich"" have hired hands who go out in armored trucks and scavenge goods from nearby houses and department stores for them and it is almost comical watching these rich pukes pretend like nothing of catastrophic proportions has happened as they go by doing ""business as usual"". I mean the world has come to an end and you hear advertisements for the stores in that high rise and see these people dresed up and sitting in a 5 star restaurant being served fine food. Never underestimate the power of denial. Tension ensues when one of the hired hands gets snubbed by his boss and seeks revenge. The specifics are irrelevant at this point because Land of the Dead is not one of those smart, even bleak zombie apocalypse movies about the end of human kind and the fall out of that; it isn't even so much about survival and asking the tough questions; instead it is your typical, run of the mill action movie a la Escape From New York or something with zombies and all the gore that accompanies them thrown in. Here story is secondary.

What made this all ridiculous was the fact that the zombies basically stopped being zombies and developed intelligence, organized, knew how to handle tools and basically became much more than evil animated corpses, which IS THE WHOLE POINT OF ZOMBIES. They aren't supposed to be intelligent, thinking things through, organize, assemble and be freaking McGuyver or something. I think that sort of defeats the whole purpose of this genre. Zombies are great because unlike any other horror villain, zombies don't have a will of their own and are bereft of consciousness and self-awareness, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli; they don't seem to have a reason for being really other than feeding on the living and moving on in their brain dead daze. That is what makes zombies so terrifying and changes the landscape of a movie from delightfuly scary to unexpectedly terrifying. A zombie is not supposed to think and assemble tools - he is no longer a zombie then. This movie ventured into that direction to the point of trying to evoke sympathy for them and their ""cause"". Zombies going to take revenge, crying when one of their own is ""dead""....come on.

This movie wasn't eerie, it didn't provoke that feeling of desolation and desperation you expect nor that of horror or terror; it was sort of like Mad Max (in terms of the post apocalyptic depiction) meets Water World, Total Recall and zombies or something. Overall I wasn't very impressed with this. It is entertaining if you can manage to suspend disbelief completely but pretty low quality script wise. Bad writing, two dimensional characters, non existent character development, ridiculous premise of the ""zombie cause"" and trying to get sympathy for them as if they were just ""misunderstood"" or something, clichees piled on top of more clichees and predictable at every turn.

The premise of this movie is utterly stupid, moronic and completely laughable. I kept expecting a zombie band to leap out on a stage and start singing, ""we will...we will.... EAT YOU!"" or start singing, ""We are the world."" In the final scene, a main character is about to shoot at a herd of zombies marching on an overpass and another main character tells him not to because ""they're like us.

While the rest of humanity etches out survival in a slum-like territory fenced off from the Green.  The dead are atill lurking and have found ways to think in a rudimentary sense, i.e. using tools and communicating.  Most of you reading this have likely seen this film already, but It really is a superb zombie film...plenty of gore and terrific SPFX and lots of humor and scares.  Romero proves once again he is the master of the genre.  LOTD is by turns funny,ironic, and very scary...

The Bluray presentation is outstanding.  Fine detail and imagery are rendered superbly.  Every rotted bit of flesh is visible and every gory kill is rendered in explicit detail.  No DNR, aliasing, or banding rain on the party.  The image is very filmic.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack is thunderous and a revelation for those who own the SD edition.

Not only is this film more than that, it is actually a very watchable film. Having not encountered a George Romero film before (except via many inaccurate parodies), I wasn't aware that there is proper direction and a decent plot at its heart.

Although occasionally you may shout at the screen as the charactors end up splitting up or abandoning safety for stupid reasons, it is still compelling viewing and there is enough suspense, gore and horror to make a highly entertaining film.

It's also worth mentioning that there is almost a Greek fable quality to the film, with stupid selfish humans ending up being horribly mauled while the more enlightened humans escape the zombies' clutches.

Lastly there is the acting, with the guy who plays&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mentalist/dp/B001CTDH76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mentalist</a>&nbsp;doing a sterling job as the lead, and Dennis Hopper doing his usual best as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/villain-of-the-film/dp/B000063JDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">villain of the film</a>. Furthermore, none of the acting comes across as hammy, and I didn't see any scenes which were stilted or not believable.

To sum up, although slow-walking Zombie films may seem ten-a-penny, really the work of an original master is beyond the sordid cliches of his imitators.
Like watching an original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wes-Craven/dp/B001G8XOMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wes Craven</a>&nbsp;movie (as opposed to a franchised sequel), the watered-down version often marrs the original.

Loved the acting by Simon Baker, who seems to be able to create any character desired in whatever film/TV show he is in and make him believable. I also liked seeing Robert Joy (from CSI: New York) as his somewhat mutilated side-kick. He does a brilliant job of creating that character - so very very different from his CSI role. Good DVD to play for Halloween or any time you're in the mood for a little over-the-top gore after a bad day at work or wherever. In the extra, Simon Baker says he had lots of fun doing this movie, and no doubt he did, and probably so did the rest of the cast. It would be impossible to take the thing seriously.

1552449,3,B00005JO16,"Land of the Dead is 2005 horror zombie film directed by Master Romero and is the fourth of his series.  The story involves apocalyptic-style politics and, of course, zombies.  Briefly, Paul Kaufman, (played by Dennis Hopper), has re-built a small, privileged community in Pittsburgh that is contained within a skyscraper now called, ""Fiddler's Green"".  A small chunk of the surrounding city which is protected from the undead by two rivers and an electric fence houses the lowlier types; Orwellian common folk, if you will.  Riley Denbo, (played unenthusiastically by Simon  Baker), is one of the trodden.  Kaufman seeks luxury, Riley wants to get out of the city and head north to the country, and the zombies want brains.

I wasn't particularly impressed with the results, here, especially considering the year it was released.  Had I no knowledge of the time-line, I probably would have placed this production sometime in the mid-90's.  The steamy, punkish street settings looked dated to me.  One example would be towards the beginning of the movie when a group of zombie killers are riding Thunderdome-style motorcycles in aggressive circles while whooping and celebrating, you know, whatever violence is currently getting them all riled up.  This is happening on dark, damp streets while the zombies stagger absently around the commotion and I guess it just bored me.  Trite, I suppose.  This has been done before so many times.

The acting was flat and uninspiring, also.  I didn't find myself really cheering for anyone in this film, even the zombies.  And I think it was Romero's intention to create some sense of compassion for these creatures.  He shot off on an inventive angle by designing them to show some emotion and feeling, but it wasn't quite enough to feel right.  They eventually start altering their thinking while following a head zombie and start picking up and using arsenal like guns and axes.  We even get to watch one zombie sorth through his own little watershed moment when he abandons his tambourine for a real weapon.  *shrug*  Not a fan.

If I've anything to say in favor of this movie, it would be the gore.  In the end, I know what to expect from a zombie film, and if the storyline is poor, that's okay.  Just show me something different while these things are wandering around wiping people out.  This, I believe, was delivered.  We've all see the rubbery neck-skin stretch when someone's getting eaten, and that happens a lot here, too, but there's some pretty original killings scattered periodically through the film that had me grinning.  The special effects team for this movie should still be congratulating themselves on a job well done because it still stands out in this field as some of the most enjoyable deaths in undead cinema that I've ever seen.  Pretty cool stuff.

So, that's it.  I know the reviews for Land of the Dead have been favorable, but it just wasn't for me.  I've definitely seen it done better, especially by Romero.

Now, humanity barely survives.
And the undead have gotten smarter.

Zombies abound in this recent blockbuster by George A. Romero and, as always, the man who invented the zombie genre shows us he still has what it takes to turn out a good flick.

Simon Baker does a great job playing the hard-edged-yet-soft-hearted hero, while John Leguizamo steals the show as a kind of crooked hero-turned-bad guy.

What I enjoyed about this flick was the idea of a walled-in society, a city-turned-world of its own, with its own hierarchy, running down from rich to poor. I suppose that even if the dead walked the earth, we'd still have the same problems we have today with the rich getting richer and the poor poorer.

Blood and guts fill the screen of this feature: graphic, wet and sloppy. There's no shortage of stomach-turning moments here.

I liked the idea of some of the zombies getting smarter instead of just roaming around looking for folks to eat, and the idea of them trying to regain their former humanity was well done. However, the ""human-hearted"" zombies also made the creatures feel a bit too human, for my taste, and the undead lost their edge as a result.

The story was simple, but fun.

1552568,4,B00005JO16,"Featuring an army of zombies, and ample gore, George Romero's zombie saga continues in Land of the Dead (2005), where the vicious and bloody war with the undead, evolves to a new level.

Humans are barricaded inside a section of a city, that is surrounded by water.  They are safe, because the zombies don't cross water, but that's about to change.  While the peons dwell on the streets, the privileged elite reside inside a high class luxury building called Fiddler's Green.  Among them is Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), administrator of the supplies department, a group that leaves the safety of the city to forage for supplies in zombieland.  Riley Denbo (Simon Baker, The Mentalist) leads the supplies group, scrounging among the hoards of the undead, who have an insatiable hunger for human flesh.

Cholo (John Leguizamo) a member of the supplies team, steals 'Dead Reckoning', a heavily armored vehicle used on supply runs, after Kaufman shoots down his bid to become a resident in 'The Green'.  With Cholo holding the vehicle for ransom, Kaufman sends Riley, and his pal Charlie (Robert Joy), ex-streetwalker Slack (Asia Argento) along with his team of mercenaries to try and get the vehicle back.

Meanwhile Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), who ran a service station before joining the ranks of the undead, has begun to take a leadership role. Soon the zombies are on the march, and nothing can stop them.

With headshots, bodies torn open and guts ripped out, decapitations, and limbs being pull off and munched on, Land of the Dead delivers tons of explicit gore.  Dispatching the 'stenches' is so routine for the supplies team, that inattention and carelessness results in team casualties.  A bit of a self confident know it all, unphased by anything, Denbo's demeanor is reminiscent of Patrick Jane, the character Baker plays in The Mentalist, a guy who tries to maneuver and outthink people.  Kaufman represents the privilege of wealth, looking to survive any way he can, while Cholo contributes the most, to what little real emotion there is.  It is chaos when the zombies attack 'The Green', though more mayhem could have been done.  The same goes for Dead Reckoning, where the full destructive potential is not fully realized.

Land of the Dead has lots of extras, including various featurettes, and a commentary track with George Romero, editor Michael Daughtery, and producer Peter Grunwald.  The unrated director's cut is a slightly longer and has a little more gore.  Those interested in Romero's continuing zombie saga should be sure to check this out.  The violence and gore are definitely there, though the story may or may not satisfy.",1258848000,2,2646,5.002283105022831

1552570,3,B00005JO16,"To begin with, there's nothing wrong with this film.  Strong directing and camera work, solid acting, nice special effects, and an interesting setting/premise work together to create a post-apocalyptic zombie film that is fun, borderline thought-provoking, and keeps one's interest throughout.  However, as an installment in Romero's Living Dead series, it fails to hold its own.

In each of the previous Living Dead installments, Romero brought something new to the human drama, even while the basic premise essentially stayed the same.  In the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-film/dp/B0016NMW74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first film</a>, it was an issue of humans having to work together in a crisis (with strong racial issues implied throughout).  In the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/second-film/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">second film</a>, there was a more analytical exploration of quality of life as a band of survivors is forced to confront loneliness, lack of purpose, and excessive consumerism.  In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-third-film/dp/B00008G8L9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the third film</a>, man's inhumanity to man was explored in a far more merciless way and, as a side note, Romero showed that the zombies were capable of evolving into relatively benign and compassionate creatures, thus raising the question of who the real monsters were.

The problem is that Land of the Dead fails to add anything to this.  Man is still being inhuman to man (though not in as compelling and terrifying a way), and the bit about the zombies evolving is forced down our throat like its a new idea.  The human city is an interesting setting for a zombie film, and the armored tank (""Dead Reckoning"") is certainly cool, but amidst all of the bells and whistles that make up this film, there is no true insight into the human condition at its core.  Rich people are evil and mentally challenged people can be useful.  That's all the film seems to say.  There's a muddled message about terrorism in there somewhere too, but it's not of Romero's usual caliber.

Of course my biggest gripe with this film has nothing to do with its quality at all.  I've been a Romero fan since I was a kid, and in all those years, across multiple viewings of each film prior to this one, it was always my understanding that the zombie disease was passed like a virus.  A zombie bit you and BAM, you became a zombie too.  In the first film, scrambling scientists speculate that extra-terrestrial radiation has caused all of the dead to rise, but I always assumed we weren't supposed to accept that explanation.  After all, nowhere in any of the films do we ever see someone die of natural causes and then re-animate.  All deaths are caused by zombies.

However, toward the beginning of LAND, a man hangs himself and immediately reanimates.  It's entirely incidental to the plot, but it shatters mine and many people's forty year old misconception.  I suppose this shouldn't make a big deal, but it does.  Romero's basic premise is therefore no different than Ed Wood's in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-from-Outer-Space/dp/B001BSBBGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>.  Personally, I feel there's something far more compelling and exciting about the viral premise.  The idea that one ""patient zero"" could start a global pandemic of this proportion fascinates me and somehow makes the outlandish premise just a little more believable than the idea that the dead are rising everywhere.  I was the kind of kid that used to play Sim City, and my favorite part would be starting a fire in one building and seeing how fast it could spread across the city.  No, I'm not a sadist or a delinquent.  I'm a normal guy who is fascinated by destructive domino effects; how quickly one small occurrence can send ripples across cities, countries, and even continents.  Land of the Dead has killed all of that for me.  It's taken something away from the old Living Dead films that I used to get so much more out of.

So, in the end, Land of the Dead is a solid zombie post-apocalypse film, but if you love Romero's Living Dead films for the same reasons that I do, this is a film that you may choose to skip.",1257033600,2,4403,5.422907488986784

1552629,5,B00005JO16,"When I went to the first showing of Land of the Dead, I was excited beyond words. I loved the movie so much I called into work that morning and went to the matinee showing. To say the least I was blown away... Being that this was my first Romero film on the big screen, I didn't know what to expect. When the zombies began marching on the screen I was in heaven! That day I rediscovered my love for the zombie genre, after being burned out on remakes and the like plaguing our cinemas as of recently, it was refreshing to see the master return to the genre he created. I loved the film so much I went back the same night to watch it again and it still knocks my socks off.

It continues the logical progression of the ""smart"" zombie Bub from the original Day of the Dead, only this time without human intervention does one become dangerously aware. Set into the future of the zombie plague that began with Night of the Living Dead, the zombie menace outnumbers the human remainder in the millions. Struggling to survive under a self-styled government built by industrialists, the down and out folks eek by a meager living behind electrified fences in the streets beyond the skyscrapers as both sides try to live as though everything were normal.
Outside in the wastelands, a band of soldiers and handpicked folks utilize a armored tractor trailer dubbed Dead Reckoning to search for edible food to bring back into the city.
Only this time things seem to be changing drastically for the worse, as the zombie aware of the danger tries desparately to warn the others when the ""skyflowers"" (aka fireworks) begin blooming in the night. What begins is a struggle for survival on both sides of the fence, the living most fend off themselves and the onslaught of the newly awakening walking dead.

Filled with darkly humerous moments, a soldier landing on his own grenade got some chuckles and some violent and powerful imagery, Big Daddy having to kill his own to stop their suffering, Land of the Dead is truly a underrated masterpiece of Romero's Zombie Legacy.

 The Director's cut offers new bits and gags to the film that were edited either for time or because they were out of place (George is a master editor of course, he was the one responsible for putting together the first three films by hand as computer editing suites didn't exist then). A few gory bits that didn't make it to the film are also featured here, and a incredible in-depth making of on the special effects of the film with that includes a short tour of KNB effects studios where the zombies were built for the film.

As interesting bonus was some of the films gory moments put a classical music score (I believe Mozart) which was really cool little music video. And for fans of Shaun of the Dead, check out the featurette When Shaun met George and see Shaun of the Dead star Simon Pegg make a cameo as a zombie in the film!",1240531200,2,2893,4.5239005736137665

Dennis Hopper rules over the city in despotic fashion, as sort of a zillionaire Stalin figure. Simon Baker and John Leguizamo are two of Hopper's men.

Many people don't like this movie because the zombies are different, smarter. They're evolving from the shuffling lumps of meat we've come to love over the years. But isn't the creater of the series allowed to do what he wants with his creation? It's not like with other zombie movies that go completely astray from the many ""rules"" as with various vampire films. Romero gave hints of this evolution in Dawn (with zombies returning to the malls to shop) and with Day (the main zombie, Bub, recalling actions he may have done while he was alive, also interacting with various objects given to him), and has stuck to the basic concepts of flesh eating, shuffling corpses that die with a shot to the head.

The makeup & effects were considerably better in this film, thanks greatly to CG effects. This Director's Cut features extended death scenes and extra splatters of blood that would have given the theatrical release limited exposure. Most of these effects were created by Greg Nicotero, who starred in and was Savini's assistant in Day. Some of the effects would have been impossible or just look too fake with conventional effects, so its use here gives Land a fresher coat of blood, which may have turned off many fans of the series.

It stars John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, & Asia Argento (daughter of famed Italian Horror Director Dario Argento), a first for Romero since his previous zombie films have starred unknown actors, at least to my knowledge.

The extras aren't as extensive as I expected, but it had enough to keep me satisfied.

Overall this is a great addition to Romero's world of flesh-eaters. It rates high on my list of horror films, concluding what would happen should hell become too full, and the dead walk the earth.",1234483200,,2547,5.948087431693989

Land of The Dead is the long awaited 4th chapter by the film making legend George A. Romero. The story takes place 3 years, after Night of The Dead, what's left of the living have built a walled-in city, to keep the dead out!
But not all is well, because there is plans of a revolution to overthrow the city's leadership, the zombie's are getting smarter and to make matters worse the zombie's have a leader called Big Daddy, leading a army of zombies, to break in to the city.

This was George Romero's first dead movie to be made by a major Hollywood
studio ""Universal"" which is good and bad at the same time. The good side of it was that the film was bigger in terms of it size, scale and scope, which also had some great action set pieces, the downside about this being a major Hollywood film was that it felt too mainstream for some fans, plus it I felt did not get the box office results it deserved, because it got released around the same time Batman Begins, which hurt the films chances at the box office.

The zombies in this film are compared - by Romero himself - to Islamic terrorists.  George Romero tried to make this utterly twisted comparison between people behaving badly and the zombies.  The profundity at the end, where they claim that the zombies need to find a place of their own in the world, is just staggeringly bizzare.  Zombies control the entire world at this point.  They eat people.  There is no making ""friends"" or creating some lasting peace by simply letting the zombies be.

It's just plain loony.

The character played by Dennis Hopper is supposed to be Dick Chaney.  Aside from a haircut that looks something like what Chaney would wear, there is no personality comparison between the two individuals, save only from the superficial mindset of a modern-day liberal.  It just doesn't play.

It's clear that what Romero professes to achieve in his grand social commentary in the film, fails when executed on the big screen.  And it's probably just as well.  Had it been less ""subtle"", the film would have undoubtedly been unwatchable.",1225670400,,1298,4.885321100917431

That said, it is clear that Romero has run out of ideas, and his attempts at social commentary in the original Night Of The Living Dead and original Dawn Of The Dead (both have been remade) have gone pallid. Those two original films were unique, in that they rose above their horror genre and zombie subgenre to become great films, much in the way Alien and Aliens transcended the horror-sci fi ghetto and the first two Terminator films did the same for cyborg-time travel flicks. But, there must be some sort of rule that allows only the first two films of such genres to become classics, for the last original zombie film from Romero, 1985's Day Of The Dead, was horrible, and this film, while a little better, is still nowhere near passable. Romero, in fact, has seen subsequent generations of zombie enthusiasts pass him by.... The film is the most impressive of his zombie quartet, due to CGI, but the actual dead look the least scary of all the zombies. The DVD comes with a number of featurettes, but the Romero-led commentary track talks of mainly minor film details, in an in-jokey way, and little of the mythos, so is rather banal, which recapitulates the almost generic feel that this film has, as if Romero was told some backers wanted a fourth film, gave him lots of money to make it, and then he was stuck with figuring everything else out, especially a script, so took the money and ran, and merely stole from his earlier films.",1221350400,,1775,4.5327102803738315

The big man who runs it all is the dangerously powerful Kaufman, and the film itself focuses on the group of marauders who work for him, particularly reluctant hero Riley and wannabe social-climber Cholo. Their job is to lead teams who travel outside the city on raids to collect goods from abandoned towns. Riley, however, is sick of the life within Kaufman's city and has made plans to get a car and head north, but his plans are interrupted when his former partner Cholo takes possession of Dead Reckoning, Kaufman's heavily armed, zombie proof raiding vehicle. Riley, his sidekick Charlie, and new friend Slack suddenly find themselves coerced into a mission to retrieve the vehicle from Cholo just as a large collection of intellectually evolving zombies are working their way into the city itself.

""Land of the Dead"" is a film Romero fans and zombie fans in general had been awaiting for a LONG time. When we finally got it, many of us were thrown for a loop by the concept of zombies learning (or is it remembering?) to tote guns and feel emotion, despite tastes of this from the previous film, ""Day of the Dead"". Ya gotta love how so-called fans who didn't like this film are trying to tell George A. Romero how his living dead are SUPPOSED to act; creatures that he himself invented. At first, I didn't love the concept of zombies becoming thinking creatures either, but given time, I've accepted that this direction was coming. How many times can you ask George to make movies about surviving the same basic situation? Okay, I could watch a million new ones, but still, it's understandable. And yet this is the main gripe people seem to have about this film. Oh well, you can't please everyone. Putting that aside, the film itself is a great ride! Another example of why Romero zombie films are the top of the heap. The characters in the film are wonderfully written and played. Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy were just wonderful. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as the despicable Kaufman, and while there's nothing likable about zombie leader Big Daddy (sorry, the only good zombie is a completely dead zombie), he's an unforgettable presence. The effects are fantastic, the story is exciting and engaging. The only things I could possibly nit-pick about are one moment of CGI that is a bit too CGI, and the overall concept of money still having value (not impossible, but unlikely). Still, these things are forgivable in such a cool movie loaded with awesome scenes! Definitely a worthy addition to the Romero zombie saga, and just loads of horrific fun!

The great looking widescreen, unrated, director's cut DVD features some great extras (though no theatrical trailer for some reason). There's a great director commentary, some excellent featurettes (including a fun day on the set with John Leguizamo and a look at Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's experience doing a cameo in the film), and even deleted scenes! It is unquestionably a must-have for any horror DVD collection, as are all the Romero zombie flicks!",1217030400,2,3542,4.852892561983471

It's fun - from the old-style Universal Logo to the opening credits montage all the way to the end.  The world has suffered from the living dead plague for years, and what few human survivors remain live in a walled off enclave.  Within this group, a lucky few live in high rise luxury while most live on the streets a mere few blocks away from the zombie hordes.

It's implied that there are other city-state survivors, and for whatever reason a paper money economy has survived.  The survivors loot abandoned towns for supplies and a few luxuries.  One of the career looters has notions of joining the elite class, but is rebuffed; in revenge, he steals an armored truck and threatens the safety of the rich few.  Our hero is dispatched to retrieve the truck, and naturally the living dead are let in the city to wreak havoc.

The plot is outlandish, but presented seriously and supported by reasonably good acting (Robert Joy's Charlie stands out).  Dennis Hopper is over-the-top, but goes back and forth from being an executive and a thug with ease.

Of course it's gory, and it has a Romero-esque message (presented a little too ""on the nose"") and all the trappings of a great zombie flick.  Yes, the zombies evolve, and that has always been part of the Romero zombie arc.  (If you prefer ""Dawn Of The Dead"", watch that instead).

They're dead humans reanimated, they only think about eating brains and human flesh, and when they're not thinking about that.... well... they're never NOT thinking about that. That's what makes zombies so great. They're mindless shuffling relentless flesh eating machines. So when they start communicating in grunts and primitive gestures and formulating a plot to take over one of the last human cities you kinda throw the whole allure of the zombie out the window. Now you have a movie about a group of stupid cannibles attacking a town. Or basically vampires (zombie's undead cousins) without fancy abilities. The acting sucks, surprisingly, even though the cast consisted of quality actors. It sounded like a good idea in theory but it ended up falling WAY short.",1215734400,2,829,5.102941176470588

Land of the dead spends much of its time focusing on zombie head explosions, spilling intestines, and explosions, rather than the intricate character building that made Day and Diary of the dead so spectacular, but manages to retain an intelligent plot structure for the small amount of time that this is given any focus, and to be an A grade action/horror movie that is better than much of the competition. Romero is a master of directing talent. The plot that does exist focuses on the time tested issue of a split between the upper and lower class. In this case, the upper class lives in a luxurious high rise while the lower class is left in the streets. There is a struggle between the classes and their zombie rivals. This is all fleshed out by wonderfully shot, and never absurd, zombie blasting, intestine spilling action. The characters play their parts well, and remain interesting though as compared to Day and Diary of the dead, we know almost nothing about them of real interest. That's okay though. This is a certain type of movie, unique in the franchise, as is every other entry. The movie is beautiful to watch, fun to watch, and without a single minute that drags. This is a hollywood, big budget looking glossy action/horror flick that is among the best of its type. It won't stimulate your mind the way the aforementioned two dead movies will, but is well worth the trip. Land of the dead does justice to a series of movies that continues to be fresh and unique with every entry.

Romero's reach for social commentary via the undead appears to have exceeded his grasp of how even a world where the dead come back to the life has to adhere to other rules that support the likely.

The rich are rich because they have the most cash? How does this compute in a post-apoc/post-federal reserve world with miles and miles of untended cash registers for the plundering?

What need was there for a highly unlikely heavily reengineered massive all-terrain assault vehicle built from the remains of a train engine when a military vehicle or something a little more A-Team/Mad Max would have sufficed?

I liked that he extended the idea of the zombies getting smarter first put forward in Day of the Dead as this could have some interesting ramifications for their origin, but it felt a bit silly and poorly executed.

That said, it's zombies. It's got Dennis Hopper. It's post-apoc. If that sounds like it's enough for you it probably is. But it doesn't hold a candle to contemporaries 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.",1206489600,,1300,4.76
1552756,3,B00005JO16,"When the moment  i've been waiting for more than a decade finally arrived and passed, my heart was divided. The movie was great and i liked it as entertainment, but what about my zombie-film fan backup, the one that took me years to put togheter and  get to love? Let's check  the two usual and controversial points in Romero's ""Living Dead"" features, in this last version of the saga he invented:

-THE HORROR MOVIE: Great, spectacular, entertaining, creepy, menacing, disturbing, dark, atmospheric action and horror film after all. Romero's redemption finally arrived after his last and less effective ""day of the dead"" feature. In this movie, he manages to create the tense and gruesome atmosphere for the ""End of the World"" scenario he always wanted. We can apreciate from the first scene every detailed aspect of the Zombie apocalypse on the planet, the hopeless and despaired  remaining humans living like rats, going outside armed to the teet looking for suplies ,shooting around like crazy cowboys, but breathing the zombie terror in every desperate minute. There is absolutely no hope. Humanity's fate finally  came down in one of the most visceral and dark catastrophes ever portrayed on film. The gates of hell are open: behold the zombie hordes taking over the World.

Great fast-action horrific and tense story, simple and straight forward, in a great acomplished ambient anybody could possibly achieve for the zombie menace. The morbid tale with the right ambient finally came, but....

-THE ZOMBIE CULTURE: What is going on here? Is romero trying to take his mythology to a new level? I guess the professor's ""Pet"" Zombie and his experiments back in ""day of the dead"" were for real, at least for Romero. For me, Zombies don't have to necesary be the theme, only a mean to create terror, right? So what's this ""social behaviour"" thing going on between zombies, this new leadership issue and the ""compassion"" showed for each other? I know they move in groups, are helpful to each other and share the task to destroy humanity, but this is too much: Now, they are self-aware, they almost have feelings, they provide mutual colaboration, they use weapons instead of tools, they have a leader? They're still cannibal vicious creatures, thank god, but this new zombie society putted me down. No matter how many people they dismember and eat alive, i just can't get over the last scene:""they only want to be left alone, in peace"" NOOOO... Why did they invaded the city in the first place? To get filled with human flesh and leave in peace? We're cool now? Maybe we are taken this issue too seriously.

Anyway, for the fantastic portrayal of the zombie apocalypse on earth , the struggle of the remaining mand-kind and the lost humanity in this new, raw, and cruel world, survival techniques and display of  military power, for Tom Savini, the great story, and any implied social propaganda, thank you Romero.

For the zombie culture aspect, i guess in a few more years we will have to ask the zombies what's really going on. Don't mind me, this is a very entertaining film, i recomend it  for anybody who's up for real chilling screams! Then you tell me if Romero was ""eaten"" by his own myth.

The DVD edition is great, the extras are much like endless humurous documentaries, but the interviews are interesting. Find out why the master did what he did. Enjoy the Uncut Edition or the Original theatrical edition, it's all good.",1206316800,4,3435,4.851282051282051

1552758,5,B00005JO16,"I had read many negative reviews of this film (by horror film junkies and longtime Romero fans), so I wasn't expecting much.  Lo and behold not only is this a very good film, but it's a worthy follow up to all of Romero's dead films.  Perhaps many people were disappointed by this film because Romero took the Dead films in a different direction here.  He didn't make a nostalgic film or anything like that.  He made a very vivid, bleak, unforgiving, gory (warning for gorehounds...the gore is not ""fun"" gore), and intense.  I think it's an excellent film.  It's occasionally heavy handed (Hopper's character is obviously a stand-in for the Bush administration, which Romero admits in the commentary), but it's extremely watchable and a worthy entry into the zombie series.  It also has some of the best acting of the entire series.  Simon Baker and John Leguziamo are superb here, playing characters that seem like real people instead of horror film characters.  Asia Argento, daugher of Dario and longtime friend of the Romero family, isn't really given anything to do here.  She's nice to look at, but that's about it.

There are many memorable scenes here, especially the shot where the zombies cross the river.  It's reminiscent of a shot in Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls (a film Romero saw when it came out and that he deeply admired), except this time it's in color and there's CGI used in it (very good CGI).  All of the performances here are very sincere, and that helps a lot.  There's no tongue in cheekness here.  Romero takes a very somber tone with this film and keeps it until the end.  I think it's one of his best films.  It's not as good as Dawn (my favorite) or Night, but it's better than Day of the Dead (which is very underrated in my opinion) and it deserves to be talked about in the same breath as Romero's other works.",1203638400,2,1846,4.613496932515337

I love the zombies in this movie and how they start off dumb until one of the main zombie characters named ""big Daddy"" starts teaching them little things like how to use the guns & to work together. also, the zombies seem to try to make believe their still alive by ""trying"" to do some of the things they used to do when they were alive. As for the non zombie actors in the movie, their all great as well. John Leguizamo plays the part of a goodguy/badguy who is second in command of a whole crew of delinquents that go into theses towns full of zombies to get & bring back food & supplies for the other living people locked inside a ""zombie free"" area. But his reckless ways come between him & the first in command (Simon Baker) Set out to reach different goals these two bump heads threw the whole movie. Then there's the powerful, rich ""big man"" (Dennis Hopper) who cares only for himself and has his hands in everything from politics to drugs, to even murder. Makes you wonder whose the bad guys the zombies or the living. My favorate character is the guy who plays Simon Bakers best friend in the movie. He's mentally special (a little slow) in the movie but is completely loyal to Simon cause Simon saved his life by pulling him out of a fire(they don't show that in the movie but he talks about it) So here's this guy with his face all burnt up & a little slow who everyone makes fun of him but what makes him so awesome is his loyalty to Simon and how he always watches his back & the awesome part is that he's a perfect shot with his guns, like a proffesional gunsman.

It still has the romero's touch i have loved since his first night of the living dead back in 1968. When making a movie of this type of genre is not making the ten commandments. The story is simple an enclosed city and zombies outside and then you have people which  like it or not don't think alike.so humans tend to forget the outside and amuse themselves by doing all the stupid things we all normally do in real life. While this is happening the zombies get intelligent slowly but surely as for me thats the terror of it all,UNDERESTIMATING them. I think romero put a good story in an enclosed city with your rich and poor and money is the issue which i am sure if this was reality THATS WHAT WE WOULD DO.But thats my opinion as for me i will add another george romero film to my collection and anymore zombie movies he makes because he always gives us the true nature of ourselves in the worst kind of conditions,great job george!",1190592000,,1244,4.271186440677966

The only reason to watch the movie is to see zombies eat and destroy, but how many movies have we seen that are like that? This movie offers nothing new and is the same old thing that has been done a million times. We have even seen a zombie figure out how to use weapons on Day of the Dead, so zombies using weapons on here was nothing new either.

If you've seen Dawn of the Dead (the newer version with Ving Rhames in it) and you're expecting Land of the Dead to be just as good, you're going to be disappointed. This film isn't nearly as action packed or as crazy fun as Dawn was.

That's not to say it's a bad film. The plot is decent, although not without a few ""why the hell?"" sorts of questions, and John Lequizamos' acting is spot on I think for this kind of film. Th problem I think is that given the plot and the whole world the characters are living in, there aren't many action scenes & when you do get one, it still isn't as thrilling as Dawn because the Zombies here are a lot slower. Instead of running towards someone to kill and eat, they shuffle, or at best walk at a fast pace.

So just to sum it up since I don't like long reviews, this movie is worth a rental. I'm not a big George Romero follower, so I wasn't expecting too much. If you are a George fan, you'll probably see this movie anyway, but like I said, give it a rental.",1185494400,,1047,4.028846153846154

From one perspective, the opinions are justified.  From another side, its blasphemous to speak out against the father of the modern zombie movie.

""Land of the Dead"" provides a unique evolution of the zombie movie from the founding father himself.  The story is massively gory, with zombie feasts spread throughout.  One is reminiscent of the project apartment scene from the original ""Dawn..."", but jacked up about 10 notches from its '70's counterpart.

In regards to the zombies ""thinking/feeling"", many have forgotten that Romero has touched on the exact same subject in the original ""Day..."" with the unforgetable ""Bub"".  This only takes that theme and builds on it to a shockingly beautiful crescendo.  Eugene Clark is brilliant in his portrayal of the ""Gas Station Zombie"", Dennis Hopper is fantastic as the fat cat capitalist ignoring the problem, John Leguizamo provides a sympathetic protagonist against Asia Argento and Simon Baker.

There is plenty of gore and zombies getting shot with high-powered weaponry, including ""Dead Reckoning"", the original name of the movie.  There is also plenty of overt commentary on American society.  No Romero movie would be complete without it.

There is also an outstanding scene with a mass of zombies that rivals any mass zombie rising in a graveyard.

It's not a ""horror film"" in the traditional sense...more like an apocalyptic science fiction piece out of the pages of ""Heavy Metal"" magazine in its peak years. At the center of the action is rich characterization, with a cast of oddballs and misfits adding up to a satisfying whole: Simon Baker's ""Riley Denbo,"" John Leguizamo's ""Cholo,"" Dennis Hopper's villain ""Kauffman,"" Asia Argento's magnificent anti-heroine ""Slack,"" Robert Joy's ""Charlie,"" the loyal sidekick to Riley, and Pedro Miguel Arce's understated powerhouse ""Pillsbury."" In terms of special effects, there are some things in ""Land of the Dead"" you haven't seen before. I won't offer spoilers, but trust me...you'll see new things. There's also a reliance on CGI computer effects...discussed by Romero in the disc's extras...that are hit and miss, but were necessary evils due to the film's budget. I've found that repeated viewings of the film reveal subtle layers and nuances. ""Night Of The Living Dead"" and ""Dawn Of The Dead"" were trend-setting, rule-breaking films.

The ruler of the city who is a wealthy and greedy tycoon named Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) wants to have control of the city to himself with the upper class citizens in nice buildings and poor people on the streets, two renagades named Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizomo) with a team and two friends Slack (Asia Argento) and Charlie (Robert Joy) would sometimes go outside the city for survivors and destroy zombies but unknown to them, the living dead are evolving and might have a plan to get into the city.

After years of rumors of a 4th entry in the Living Dead series, George A. Romero finally delivers a spectacular, entertaining and gory as hell entry that might surpise fans of the trilogy. Too bad it didn't too well at the box-office, luckily i saw this at a theater and loved it! it's got new life on DVD and cable even among some fans of Romero's zombie series. Tom Savini does an amusing cameo as the blade biker from ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) and this movie is loaded with gore but more in the unrated cut, it's good bloody fun for zombie fans that i recommend.

1552898,5,B00005JO16,"I love zombies.  I own Resident Evil 2 and 3 for my Sony Playstation, and now I've grown to love zombie movies as well.

Land of the Dead is a pretty good zombie movie.  It's graphic, bloody, and creative in that people turn into zombies and die differently each time.  However, there was actually very little bits showing people turn into zombies, which is a negative.  The story was more about, if a zombie bites you, you have to be killed immediately.  If they would have shown more people turning into brain dead, moaning zombies, it would have appealed to me more.

The unusual thing about Land of the Dead is how the zombies actually walk around with a spark of intelligence and continue to act almost human-like.  Maybe that has something to do with bad acting, though.  If you can't moan like a zombie, get off the stage.

The film started out slow.  It just didn't start out like a very convincing zombie film.  That all changed about halfway through, when the people were on the run.  This is when the zombie outbreak got incredibly intense.  It's worth a watch.

Update- May 16, 2016.

I forgot about Land of the Dead!  I watched this movie many years ago.  I didn't know Simon Baker at the time and started to know him later as the star of the Mentalist (hit TV show) so it's a surprise someone like him would portray lead role in a zombie film.  He's not walking around smiling arrogantly or being intellectually superior to everyone like he is on the Mentalist so that's good (granted I thought his character was funny but still- wouldn't work in a zombie film that tries to be more horror than comedy!)

Basically this is another zombie movie with more emphasis on blood splatter and shootings.  My original review mentions some things I wouldn't mention in a review now such as zombies biting regular people then the people have to be killed afterwards because they're now infected.  It's common knowledge in zombie films these days to kill those who are infected, but 10 years ago the zombie genre was new to me so I felt the need to point out such minor things.

Asia Argento is the hot babe that follows Simon around.  She's pretty twisted too, never hestitating to kill if the situation calls for it.  John Leguizamo is the bad guy.  He wants to kill Dennis Hopper's character for some reason that was never clear to me.  He used to work for Dennis and didn't like how he lost his job I guess, so John threatens Dennis through phone calls and other means.  Unfortunately for both, the number of zombies populating out there is quite high so they both find themselves having something in common- worrying about zombie bites!  Too bad Dennis' lit up building is a perfect view for the zombies.  It also wasn't clear when John got infected and wasn't killed right away despite a gun pointing at him.  The guy didn't pull the trigger and walks away leaving John alone with his bite struggles.  Huh?

LOL!  Eugene Clark plays the role of a zombie leader.  At least, he seems to be more intelligent and is even able to think logically compared to the other zombies, so the zombies often follow his lead.  Eugene doesn't make a very good zombie though.  Usually you can at least pretend these actors/actresses are portraying zombies, but it's hard to do that in the case of Eugene who very clearly is a regular person.  Something is wrong with Robert Day's face too.  Great moment between him and Asia involving a gunfire exchange when zombies sneak up behind both.

Overall great movie.",1174608000,,3500,4.582258064516129

George Clooney should be in this film because he is perhaps on of the best zombies to ever walk the earth in the last 20th century.

1552959,3,B00005JO16,"George A. Romero's long-awaited return to the cannibal zombie genre he created is something of a mixed bag.  On the positive side, Romero at least got decent funding for this one, as the special effects, photography and acting (for the most part) are top notch.  Another satisfying element is that the gore-master has attempted to develop his zombies beyond the shambling (and almost comical) beings in Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead.  Here, they are becoming more advanced...the leader of which is developing the ability to reason and (almost) speak.

Still, for the most part, we are still dealing with shuffling corpses with a taste for flesh, something we've all seen a million times by the countless Romero imitators out there.  While other talented filmmakers (including Zack ""Dawn of the Dead Redux"" Snyder and Simon ""Sean of the Dead"" Peg) are reinventing the genre in exciting (and often comical) ways, Romero is basically treading water here.

Romero has genuine talent as a filmmaker, but it is getting frankly depressing seeing him repeat himself yet again.  And good production aside, his sledgehammer approach to social comment is getting pretty tiresome at this point.  Even Romero's trademark hardcore gore effects (richly evident in the DVD's ""uncut"" version), although well executed, appear obligatory and don't have much impact.

Another let down is an uncharacteristicly lifeless performance by Dennis Hopper as head of a bunch of upper crust condo dwellers sheltered from the rampages of the dead.  Comparing his performance here to his crazed but facinating work on Apocolypse Now and you almost wish he'd get BACK on drugs.

The acting was good and the premise of the plot, I thought, was very interesting (a view of zombies after 40 years and the ways humans have succeeded or failed in keeping them at bay).  The problem was all in the way the zombies were portrayed..  they just weren't scary..  at all.  The idea that zombies would evolve is kind of far-fetched anyway (when do they have time to evolve when they're constantly decaying..)  The zombies were very slow moving but not in an aggressive or menacing way.  They almost seemed too human and that took away from a lot of the terror of the film.

Overall, I'd recommend checking out one of the better Zombie films if you're in the mood for a good scare (Night of the Living Dead or even the hilarious Shaun of the Dead would both be better bets).",1165363200,3,869,4.455696202531645

1553009,3,B00005JO16,"This is so late that it'll be hard to find anyone who cares - but I still wanted to post my thoughts on ""Land of the Dead,"" George Romero's latest (and probably, last) zombie movie.

I've been a big G.R. zombie fan ever since ""Night of the Living Dead"" became a Halloween staple on local TV. Around 1980, KTLA advertised a Halloween showing of ""the most horrifying movie ever made"" and launched a big PR push for ""Night of the Living Dead"" (or NOTLD, if you're a Dead Head). For about a week prior to showing the movie, they'd run these promo's that were brief shots of Barbara (played by Judith O'Dea) running while a grim sounding announcer warned that the movie contained ""extremely graphic depictions of terror and cannibalism."" Adult supervision was recommended and so I had to watch. I was, at 20, technically an adult, so I watched with my kid brother and thoroughly enjoyed the flick.

You gotta understand that Halloween was (and is) practically a religious holiday with Jeff and me. We'd buy a ton of dry ice, dress up as slaughter victims and scare the hell out of anyone old enough that we wouldn't feel bad about it. At the time, we lived in a particularly rough neighborhood of the I.E., and keeping an axe handle close at hand was considered common-sense on most nights and especially Halloween. Anyone taller than me who showed up looking for free candy might get breakfast instead: sour milk and stale cereal in a plastic bag designed to leak all over the place. But you had to be quick to get it into their sack.

Then we'd spend the rest of the night on top of the garage armed with a garden-hose or a super-soaker loaded with vinegar to dissuade the malcontents who'd come back and try to egg our house. What can I say? We were teen jerks in a town that boasted the founding of the Hell's Angels. But I've grown up since then. Sort of.

At any rate, Halloween was a big deal. So we watched NOTLD and got a big kick out of it's simple plot line - people hole up in a remote farm-house and try not to get eaten by zombies. The formula is simple and it is the exact same story line for every zombie movie Romero ever made. Stray from the formula and it's just not an Authentic Zombie Tale.

""Land of the Dead"" is pretty much the same tale, expanded. The time frame is sorta the present. Romero correctly assumes that everyone pretty much knows the story and we're thrown into it with only a modicum of introduction. A large city is fortuitously situated on a triangle of land surrounded on two sides by large (think Pittsburgh) rivers. The 3rd side is a no-man's land of barricades and barbed wire. Or maybe it's on an island with connecting bridges - it's not really explained. But the main plot twist is how the city is managed by yuppie scum living in high rise apartments on top of a converted shopping mall called ""Fiddler's Green.""

The non-yuppie scum live in Bladerunner-esque slums on the street serving up rat stew and dressing in clothing so moldy and disreputable that the Salvation Army would say, ""uh, no thanks...""

Except for our heroes, that is, who are very fashionably attired in the sort of neo-goth clothing made fashionable by the heroes of ""The Matrix."" This is a group of mercenary/scavenger's that raid local towns and cities for supplies to keep the bourgeois up to their ears in liquor, cigars and caviar. Why they do this is beyond me and is really the weakest point of the movie.

George has always considered himself, (though not your typical self-absorbed, egotistical, hollywood wonk), more of a social commentarian rather than a guy who makes his money peddling the socially acceptable big-screen version of snuff films. So he uses this interplay of haves and have-nots to maintain this fiction, a sub-plot that was entirely missing from the original NOTLD, and only hinted at in ""Dawn of the Dead.""  So he throws this unbelievable social construct into the move.  Frankly, it just distracts from what the audience came for - zombies eating people shooting zombies.

After the plot is established you're left with the unanswered question, ""why would anybody do this?"" By that, I mean the scavengers. They risk life and limb to bring back food that supports their friends and family, sure, but most of it, it's made clear, is going to the wealthy in their high-rise apartments. And what is their reward?

Money. As in greenbacks.

Well, that's just silly. With the total breakdown of the economic and political system, food is the real currency. What would the movie have looked like if the leader of the scavengers (a little too-pure-to-be-true guy named Riley and played by Simon Baker) had told the king of the yuppies, Kaufman (played with chilling detachment and subtle arrogance by Dennis Hopper) to get bent - no food until he embraces democracy or communism or just plain starves? What's he gonna do - shoot the only people competent enough to feed a city? Let them eat Gucci's!

So that's the story, except that there's a large hungry mob of zombies waiting just the other side of the river. Which brings me to the second weakest part of the story. In all of George's previous movies, he featured a strong black character as a lead actor. In 1968, this was rather daring. By ""Day of the Dead,"" it was merely de riguer. Here the strong minority character is a ""smart"" zombie (rather well played by Eugene Clark) who realizes that a hot meal is waiting just on the other side of the river.

I don't have any problem with a strong minority character - it's the ""smart zombie"" part that's just silly. This guy becomes the undead equivalent of Che Guevarra, teaching the ""dumb"" zombies how to find and use weapons and proceeds to march on the city. Upon reaching the river, they look around and you can almost see the cartoon light-bulbs over their heads, ""hey, we're already dead! Let's just stroll across the bottom and come up on the other side..."" I'm not the world's best swimmer and it's all I can do to push down and touch the bottom. But this bunch of decaying biology experiments are not only not carried away by the tide, but they walk like they're loaded with lead and move in straight line right towards the target. I know this is a zombie flick, but seriously...  I remember thinking that one of the ghouls must've been a boy scout and still remembered how to use a compass...

The rest of the cast turns in a competent performance, with the exception of Simon Baker who, like Tom Cruise, appears to have just one facial expression (""Grim Determination"") for the entire flick. Asia Argento plays an eye-candy part as the heart-of-gold hooker who really wants to be Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, but can't escape the fact that she got this job by being the producer's neice. The most interesting character in the whole flick is played by Robert Joy, Riley's mentally-challenged second banana, who just happens to be the world's best sniper.

The gore is what we've come to expect from Romero, no big surprises there. The movies proceeds in a formulaic fashion that results in no tension - it goes from point A to point B to it's entirely predictable conclusion with no deviation. There's a couple of really poor CGI and blue screen effects that, at least in my audience, produced giggles instead of drama.

""28 Days Later"" and Zach Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake were gorier and more dramatic, with some scenes of great pathos. (The scene in Zack's DOTD where a daughter pleads for the life of her zombie-disease infected father is truly heart-breaking.) But, all that said, this movie will be a big hit with zombie dead-heads like me. It's got Romero's name on it and the formula is what we've come to expect and, frankly, what we wanted. Look for this movie to make most of it's money in DVD sales to die-hards (like me) that have every version of the first three movies on both VHS and DVD.

Everyone else may be left wondering why anybody greenlighted this movie in the first place.",1158192000,5,7952,4.618271954674221

""Land of the Dead"" is George Romero's third sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the 1968 classic that, for good or for ill, brought the horror movie genre into the modern era.  In this latest edition, we find the planet still overrun by flesh-eating zombies, but now the hitherto mindless creatures seem to be developing the ability to think for themselves.  In true ""Masque of the Red Death"" fashion, the elite survivors have holed up in a protected fortress trying to carry on the rituals of everyday life as if nothing whatsoever were wrong with the world outside.  The city is run by a ruthless tyrant, hammily played by Dennis Hopper, while Simon Baker and John Leguizamo portray mercenaries who go out on zombie-zapping missions to protect the citizenry, but who aren`t ""good enough"" to secure a home alongside the well-to-do in the walled-off city.

Although there are a few novel twists floating around in ""Land of the Dead,"" the sad fact is that, with this film, Romero may have gone once too often to the zombie well (actually make that twice too often, since the third film ""Day of the Dead"" was no great shakes either).  Gone is the nightmarish starkness that informed both ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead,"" having been replaced by scenes that look as if they came straight out of a poor man's version of ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.""  These zombies have simply lost the power to either disturb or scare us, and so the movie becomes just another flat action flick with a lot of random shooting at nameless targets.  The terror of the original film came from seeing ordinary, average people trying to cope with a situation for which there was no precedent, and having to fight against a threat they could not even begin to understand.  Yet, in a world in which zombies have become an everyday event, and everyone we`re involved with seems to be a trained zombie killer, the ability of the creatures to unnerve us becomes severely diminished.

I guess we're not supposed to actually link this film all the way back to the 1968 original, since the characters in here - who are clearly in their twenties and early thirties - keep referencing back to a more halcyon time before the zombie invasion.  Moreover, the presence of modern technology, in the form of cell phones and home computers, implies a much later date for the initial event as well (I mean, if the world had really been overrun by the living dead for close to forty years, would cell phones ever have been invented?).

As he did (quite successfully) in ""Dawn of the Dead,"" Romero tries to make some satirical points along the way - in this case, about the cravenness of human nature and the inequity of the caste system - but the attempts here are so feeble that they just come across as stereotypical and hackneyed (particularly Hopper's callous, unfeeling, every-man-for-himself dictator).

With so many other directors beating Romero at his own game of late - with better zombie pictures like ""28 Days"" and the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" - the filmmaker may have inadvertently laid the groundwork for his own destruction.  One wonders if, like the zombies who have made him famous, Romero will ever be able to rise again.",1157587200,6,3225,4.7051509769094135
1553011,3,B00005JO16,"Pehaps I was way too excited to see this movie, but as a Romero fan, I feel a bit let down.  It started out well.  I like the characters, I loved the few good zombie moments.  I have to say that there was only one moment when I was scared.  For a Romero movie, that is low.  For me, the good zombie movies have to either have some good thrills, some good laughs, or both.  This movie was lower then the others on both.

Ok, so I am watching a zombie movie, and fact that the dead are walking is not logical.  But, I have to say that the fact that money held any value in the aftermath society ruined the entire plot for me.  Whats more, a group of people felt money held enough value in the world outside their city (a world where most human forms eat flesh)that they were willing to bomb most of the people left in the world to get it.  Why not walk up to bank and take some.  One would have to think that guns, supplies, and brains (no pun intended) would be the real stuff of value.

Other then that, I enjoyed the rest.  I can see how a city with this caste system would occur.",1157500800,3,1081,3.9953271028037385
1553012,3,B00005JO16,"I will start off by saying that this was not one of Romero's best zombie flicks. It seems a little rushed, though in spirit I am sure there was a great deal that Romero wanted to put into the film even with the director's cut, but there was no real sense of zombie menace like in the previous films. The film seemed more directed towards the drama of the human characters. And intelligent zombies? C'mon now. Skip this and watch any of Romero's previous films or watch Shaun of the Dead instead!",1157068800,3,495,4.391304347826087
1553013,4,B00005JO16,"I'm not sure if this movie disappoints or not.  I'm reminded of my initial feelings on ""Day of the Dead"".  That the action was good, the gore plentiful, but somehow the story was lacking, or there just wasn't enough of ""Dawn of the Dead's"" and ""Night of the Living Dead's"" chutzpah.  I finally watched ""Day of the Dead"" in to submission and I, like Romero, actually find it to be the most enduring of the batch.  And I think it's because of the dialog, which at first seemed too much.  In the long run it makes sense to have the characters ""making sense"" of the catastrophe.  And, what's not to like about the ""intestines-sliding-out of Miguel's stomach"" dream?

Now enter ""Land"" which presents to the viewer a whole new set of characters, plausibilities, scenarios, and myths.  We wanted a new Romero zombie flick and I reckon we have to accept it on its own terms.  So I'm going to have to watch this for a few more years before I make a decision.  I'm tempted to say that I am disappointed.  That there is way too much CGI, that the feel good ending brought on by Romero's change of heart on who is the evil person (in light of the Bush era) just doesn't wash, that the characters are all equal parts unlikable, that the Dead Reckoning and Fiddler's Green scenarios are just a little one-dimensional in the plot dept.

But by the same token there is Dennis Hopper and Asia Argento, plenty of creative zombie shots, flat out gore, and even a new likable African American zombie creature (though I'm personally not really ""sold"" on him).

So... I'm not going to give this a 5 star, and it hurts.  I'm almost certain time will be kind to this movie, but just not yet.",1156118400,,1667,4.440789473684211

First of all, this movie is a mess, and you got noone to give a hoot about, noone to relate to. Why? Poor writing. Mindless killing and things being blown up every few minutes just does not make for a compelling film--in my humble opinion.

Also, this whole message thing is a bit tiresome as well. Look, George, we know you're a Lib and got the (dated) ponytail thing going, fine, but why do we have to have all this anti -Repulican stuff shoved our way?

What you don't seem to realize is that quite a few of us don't trust either the Left or the Right. Get it? Both sides have an ax to grind and (therefore) are full of it. Most people go their OWN WAY--as I always have.

1553015,3,B00005JO16,"While the fourth instalment of Romero's definitive ""dead"" saga is not really what fans were expecting, it does retain the essential element. Decent zombies. The door-opener for this film, the silly Zack Snyder remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"", just didn't cut it in that direction. To put it simply, if you can make zombies physically fit enough to run the hundred yard dash, but unable to break a window in a shopping mall to get to their food source.....you're asking a bit much. Snyder's movie, while it contained some good scenes and set pieces, just didn't come off as a proper zombie movie at the end of the day. It could/would have been a lot better, if it had stuck to the ""rules"", as it were. The `appeal' of the dead, is their sheer number and the relentlessness of the slow shuffling attack, coupled with simply not knowing where they will pop up next. Giving them the ability to race around the place somehow diluted their menace.

The aforementioned ""rules"" are included in Romero's vision and that's one of the prime strengths of his particular take on the genre he practically created, even if this particular episode leaves the viewer somewhat wishing for a little more (personally I believe the 93 min running time was too short and the story as a whole, a little anaemic).

Romero's episodic approach, serialised but not truly connected, gives us a glimpse into the lives of people who have survived the original zombie apocalypse and the small attempts at society which they have tried to establish. This particular section of the series deals with a full city of human characters or at least a partially filled city and is the largest group of humans Romero has dealt with so far. Previous films have simply dealt with small groups of people trying to cope with (and avoid) the phenomena that has engulfed them. But that is the engrossing thing about Romero's take on the world of the dead. His observations of separate groups of people and their separate methods of dealing with the undead biting at their heels and ""Land of the Dead"" is simply another look at another group. This is one of the reasons why ""Land"" is difficult to hate as much as some fans have declared.

The story itself, is quite a low key affair, for the viewer that is. For the protagonists, it's an absolute bloody disaster. It concerns itself with the simple plot that the dead completely outnumber the living (even more so than ""Day of the Dead"" I presume) and `control' the majority of the...ahem...land outside the city in which the human characters have garrisoned themselves. As supplies run low in the city, people are hired to venture outside the protection of the city and gather more supplies (including booze, which is a highly sought after commodity for the richer echelons of this post-society society). They also take a large toll on the population of the dead. All part of the job, no doubt. They travel into the hordes of the dead in a various convoy of bikes, cars and trucks. One of the vehicles that these risk-takers use is the `Dead reckoning' (the original title, by the way), a huge mock-up truck with a multitude of wheels, armour, machine guns and rockets...Absolutely zombie proof. We are introduced to these post apocalyptic `hunter-gatherers' in the movie's very entertaining opening sequence.

We are also introduced to the dead of the title. These pathetic (but terrifying) entities wander around their former stomping grounds, trying to play instruments and carrying out the former duties of the occupations they filled when they were ""alive"". One of the dead, `Big Daddy', thinks he should be filling people's cars with fuel, even though the only people driving cars these days are gun toting desperados that would be happy to put a bullet through his head. `Big Daddy' seems to have developed or retained some sort of intelligent function and awareness, an issue that was alluded to in ""Day of the Dead"". He displays a fear and loathing of the people who rampage into his town, shooting up everyone and looting. This, in time, makes him the natural leader of the dead that inhabit the one-horse town that exists in the suburbs of the city that the living people inhabit and, while not trying to give too much away, leads them in a zombie assault on that city with the obvious results ensuing. Anyone even remotely familiar with Romero's zombie flicks will be aware of what that means.

The somewhat lacklustre story aside, ""Land of the Dead"" is, in fact a fitting entry to the series. ""Night of the living Dead"" dealt with the un-defined genesis of the phenomena, ""Dawn"" dealt with the final breakdown of society in the face of the phenomena and ""Day"" and ""Land"" both deal with groups of people surviving the phenomena.

There are problems though...the major one being the timeframe of this particular episode. If we take it that ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), could have occurred in the 1970's and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978) at the turn of the decade, with ""Day of the Dead"" (1985) happening in the early 1980's, then logically ""Land of the Dead"" should be taking place in either the late 80's or early 90's. I say this because the main male and female characters, who can't be more than early/mid thirties ""remembers"" what it was like before the dead started to make an appearance. This then means that the technology/weaponry of the piece should be of a 1980's standard at best. So, we shouldn't really be seeing laptops, with digital readouts of perimeter security for the city, mobile phones or modern style military/police helmets or machine guns. It would have been better if Romero had limited the human characters firepower to M-16's, walkie talkies and 1980's style military equipment, a la ""Day of the Dead"". It's a flaw that many people wouldn't bother with, but it does let the movie down somewhat. The obvious reason for including such modern equipment in the movie is that it was probably cheaper than locating 1980's stock. It's also a reason that this film has only 3 stars and not 4.

But that aside, overall, ""Land of the Dead"" is an entertaining episode in a series that could keep on trucking along. Even after Romero joins his band of zombie hordes. The main thing is that any director, who will take up the drama, should be made to stick to Romero's established rules. The scope of the overall piece is huge and open to a multi-variation global vision. I do hope it's not the last time that we see Romero's dead walk.",1155600000,8,6465,4.736234458259325
1553055,1,B00005JO16,"It was slow, stupid, and a waste of time.. Only by this movie if you need a quick two hour nap!! The thing that made it stupid was the ""SKYFLOWERS"".

1553056,4,B00005JO16,"We should have known that if George A. Romero was going to go back to the well of the living dead another time he was going to come up with something different. What ""George A. Romero's Land of the Dead"" (the director's name goes up top so you know this is not merely another remake of one of his zombie films, like last year's ""Dawn of the Dead"") offers is two variations on the familiar theme. The first is in this brave new world humanity has found a way of perpetuating the old divide between the ""haves"" and ""haves not,"" even when there are all those zombies out there suggest it should now be ""us"" versus ""them."" Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) has set up Fiddler's Green, a luxury high rise on an island between a couple of rivers (think the location of Three River Stadium in Romero's old stomping ground of Pittsburgh even though the movie is shot in Toronto). There the ""haves"" live while the rest of the island has the ""have nots,"" some of whom are hired as mercenaries to go out into the world and bring back ""necessities."" Apparently money still matters in the ""Land of the Dead,"" or perhaps people are merely trying to hold on to the old way of life, because the poor are not listening to those advocating going and taking away from the rich.

Consequently, humanity has found a way to survive. You can compare the more active approach of ""Land of the Dead"" with the mall rats of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" who found a passive means of existence. Kaufman has built Dead Reckoning, a gigantic armored vehicle that leads foraging parties out into the world. These parties are led by Riley (Simon Baker), whose primary goal is getting everybody back alive, which does not always happen. That is because he works with Cholo (John Leguizamo), who has a different idea of necessities, one attuned to the fine tastes of Kaufman. Both men believe they are on their last mission at the start of this 2005 film, Riley because he will have now earned enough to pay for a car to get out of town and Cholo because he believes he has now earned the chance to move on up to Fiddler's Green. Both are wrong and that sets up the conflict to come.

This is where the second variation comes into play. Kaufman not only created a high rise where the ""haves"" are protected from that ""have nots,"" some of whom actually help the ""haves"" have even more, but the entire island is zombie proof. This forces Romero to change the zombie part of the equation, and so we are introduced to Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), who runs a gas station and has a moment akin to when the ape looks at the thigh bone in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Just to help us along the voice over at the start of the film warn us that if the zombies ever develop anything approaching rudimentary thinking skills that would be a bad thing, a very bad thing indeed. So, of course, that is what happens. After all, if you can have bad humans, then you can have good zombies (Joss Whedon has convinced me being dead does not make a character inherently bad).

Having a zombie to root for is quite a different experience, but Romero also delivers on the guts and gore when the zombies go into their patented feeding frenzy. The narrative can offer all the sly social satire it wants, we watch these movies to be disgusted by the bloody scenes of cannibalism. The people Romero hires to do makeup and special effects are clearly on the cutting edge when it comes to this type of work. Even when you watch the DVD special features and you see what they are doing in bright light most of it will still creep you out, so the scenes in the film shot at night or in the shadows with the liberal application of blood and other things it is even worse (which is a good thing in a zombie movie).

The bottom line is that Romero delivers just what his fans want with this movie so that there is not a problem with failing to meet expectations. No, ""Land of the Dead"" is not the best of the bunch, but for my money nothing will surpass the original ""Night of the Living Dead."" The important thing is that here we are four films into the series, limiting ourselves to just the Romero helmed ones, and the series is certainly going a lot strong than the other comparable horror series, all of which have been abandoned by their creators (which is either a cause or effect). Final Note: Look for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright of ""Shaun of the Dead"" fame as the photo booth zombies in one of the classic cameos of the early 21st century.",1154822400,17,4452,4.386198547215496
1553057,5,B00005JO16,"The latest thing in zombie stories and movies is to have them thinking.  Stephen King, Brian Keene, and George Romero are all on board.  You can practically see the reeking dead studying their thumbs like chimpanzees who have suddenly figured it all out.  Well, that's cool.  Romero's turning however indicates the real stamp of approval.  As horror buffs know everywhere, his ""Night of the Living Dead"" is an enduring classic. And it's a classic for good reason, with its underlying satire of American life in the 60s. The irony of the one real hero in the movie, a black man, being gunned down by rednecks, struck a chord that rippled beyond the genre of horror.

Romero followed up with ""Dawn of the Dead"", which was also pretty good.  It didn't have quite the punch of ""Night"", but it had a bigger budget, and the zombies attacking the local shopping mall was funny - in a way that ""Night"" was not.  We recognized ourselves stumbling past all the shops with glazed eyes.  Then came ""Day of the Dead"" which was simply bad - and boring.

Zombies kind of went into hibernation, or retreated into all kinds of forgettable horror movies - some of them made by Disney.  They were becoming poodles.  Then came Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead."" But Snyder did something different.  He looked underneath the zombie hood, and tweaked things, added fuel injection.  Suddenly zombies were track stars.  They could move and munch.  As good as Snyder's effort was (and it's very good), at its heart, ""Dawn"" is an homage to Romero.  There is nothing really new in the film as far as new satire goes.  It's still a mall, a reference point for the Dead.  One difference, is that Snyder actually went out and got some good actors to ""flesh"" things out a bit.

Well, it's 2005, and Romero still has something to say through rotting zombie gums.  ""Land of the Dead"", because of its sharp satire, is indeed a worthy update on ""Night.""  Time has indeed passed.  The rich live in towers (vertical gated communities), while the little folk are serving them below as soldiers and servants - or, are zombies living in small towns, being ripped off by marauding survivors in night attacks.  Romero returns to his black man as hero, but with a twist - since he is now a zombie (Eugene Clark as ""Big Daddy"").  And Big Daddy is an interesting twist, in that he seems to be learning how to fight - and teaching others, the Way to fight back.  He actually cares, in that cold dead zombie brain, about his community.  Big Daddy tries to save other zombies, and he cries in rage when they are killed.  In contrast, his counterpart, Kaufman (Dennis Hopper --Romero also assembled himself a good cast for this latest installment), in his high tower overlooking his safe area, could care less about his community.  All he cares about is money and power - and a good cigar.  Romero's critique of modern America, with its widening gulf between rich and poor (what used to be middle class), couldn't be more on target.  What follows is what you pretty much expect: extreme gore, the march of the inexorable dead, some funny moments, and a strangely hopeful ending - for perhaps men and zombies?  Well, I guess we will just have to wait and see.",1153612800,9,3223,4.609841827768014
1553058,3,B00005JO16,"first let me start this review by stating how much of a fan i am of George Romero and his living dead films,and zombie films in general. I think night of the living dead is a classic,Day of the dead one of the most underrated horror films out there. And dawn of the dead the best film ever made. So with great anticipation i waited for Land to be released into theaters. Opening day i was there. And when i finally saw it i couldn't help but feel disappointed. Was it a bad film?No..if anyone else would have made this film i probally would have enjoyed it more,But coming from the creator of the zombie craze george romero,i couldn't help but feel that he could have done so much more than the final result on the screen. I was expecting the dark feeling of dread that night bought,the intellectual,gory thrill ride that was dawn,combined with the fantastic make up fx and gore that was day of the dead. Instead i got cookie cutter characters who i didn't really care about,lots of meaningless explosions. And big daddy,Probally one of the worst zombies ever put on screen. How do you go from the great character of Bub in day of the dead to this laughinstock is beyond me. Of course being the huge Romero fan that i am,i bought the dvd and have watched it a couple of times since. And it does get a little better with each viewing. But every time i watch it the only thing i can think about is how much better this movie would have been if George would have done some things diffrent with the story and cut out the horrible lead zombie. Like i wrote earlier if Joe Blow off the street would have directed this movie i don't think it would be getting half the hate that is thrown at it. But because we expect so much from George Romero and his zombie films are the best in the genre,the expections were sky high. And its a shame that this movie didn't live up to them. Bottom line,i hope that George Romero gets another crack at making another dead film,And that this mediocre entry isn't his curtain call to the genre he created.",1153612800,2,2031,4.347368421052631
1553059,4,B00005JO16,"I was satisfied with this movie. I knew Romero would be back and have a heavy hand on this one, so I thought that perhaps this would be better than the Dawn of the Dead remake, and in my opinion, it was.

I actually saw this in the Theatres twice, my fiancee loved it so much she kept suggesting we go back and see it again. It kept me interested, I do not think it was necessary to give the Zombies 'progressing intelligence', but I have to admit it did add to the suspense of this movie.

Overall, I would definitly recommend seeing this.",1152835200,,540,4.1826923076923075

Now, I love zombie movies and have watched some of the worst out there (and own some of them too), but when I saw the Unrated Directors cut of this movie had come out I just had to have it.  I figured there'd be many more scenes that were probably cut from the original release for whatever reasons they do that.  I was very disappointed.  There's only the addition of one scene in the entire movie!  Granted they do have some cool bonus features but I can't understand why they added one scene and can then call it something new.  All in all the scene they did put in added nothing to the movie, so if you're into extras and want to see those then fine, but don't expect the movie to be any different or more interesting.",1149724800,3,788,4.151315789473684

They know how to run,use weapons and understand humans. So they attack a city full of rich people while the army tries to save them.

Sorry, but I thought the storyline was way to-out-there for me. I mean, look at Dawn of the Dead. That movie had a good storyline, and it scared the hell out of me. Bottom line, it wasn't scary, the gore was ok and the movie pretty much sucked. So zombie fan, you will be disappointed.",1149638400,3,722,4.388059701492537
1553063,5,B00005JO16,"This movie reflects what has been going on in the U.S. for quite some time and has  suddenly become a big, overt issue- long after the movie's release- immigration. Notice the similarities between zombies and Latino immigrants coming into the U.S. and how the living deal with the situation. Notice how Kaufman treats Cholo while he's  both alive and undead. Can you see it now? Who is the real owner of the land and who is the trespasser? It all seems to fit- at least in my eyes. ""Night"" was about Prejudice, ""Dawn"" was about pointless consumption. Both are enlightening and terrifying at the same time- that's why they are  fan favorites. ""Day"" and ""Land"", on the other hand, are the least liked of the Romero zombie films, even though they are structured like the two previous films- zombie rampages with underlying social commentary. I think  the reason why most fans don't like ""Day"" and ""Land"" so much is because the social commentary  feels too nihilistic, too hard to swallow, and they have this self defense mechanism that makes them brush it off as too simple or too preachy, or they might feel Romero is just hitting below the belt. Take ""Day"", for example, when Dr. Logan is trying to train the zombies- he mentions he can teach zombies to do anything with time, if they are promised a reward, just like we were. A critique on upbringing and religion- with just one line. Oh, man- what a bitter pill :0). What about ""Land""? As I wrote before, there's a natural, organic, true Manifest Destiny taking place. It started some time ago, it's slow moving, and there's no way to stop it. The villians want to pretend they're in control, they cling to the past, build walls, live in ivory towers, etc., while the heroes accept the change, learn to coexist and move on.",1149552000,4,1774,4.6369426751592355

Yet, there is the lighted tower, the rich man running the tower and the general scene. Besides these similarities, this is a great film. I hope that another film is produced based on this theme, perhaps with a hybrid human/zombie creature that plays both sides against each other. Perhaps even the discovery of the mystery agent (virus, bacteria, etc.) that caused the zombie situation. On that note, Stargate Atlantis' Wraith followed along similar character lines.

If you know about zombie movies, its best when they are dumb and the whole outnumbering of the humans and the humans have to fight their way out like in Dawn of the dead.

Hopper has a cadre of soldiers, lead by Simon Baker, who venture out of the safety zone to obtain goods and supplies for Hopper at their own peril.

1553107,2,B00005JO16,"I usually enjoy zombie flicks. This one made me do all the mental work, and I ended up feeling robbed.

The special effects were good, but how many times do I need to see a crowd of shamblers feasting on entrails while the victim writhes and screams? Too much emphasis on gore and too little attention to making the plot work.

That was really where the movie failed. Zombies are supposed to be retarded. That is what makes zombie flicks worth watching. If zombies are intelligent, it means I have to care about them, and I don't want to do that.

Watching the ""intelligent"" leader zombie in Land of the Dead ""figure out"" how to fire his weapon was absolutely painful, as were all the scenes where he ""taught"" other zombies to do things zombies aren't supposed to be able to figure out how to do.

It totally ruined the movie for me that these groups of shuffling, rotting creatures could walk upright properly but somehow managed to randomly figure out how to fire weapons. At the beginning of the movie, the zombies can all be mesmerized by fireworks, but at the end of the movie they have somehow collectively figured out how to ignore fireworks, but they still haven't mastered how to walk without jerking around and flailing like idiots.

Boo. Campy. This is the worst of the Romero films due to a terrible script and unbelievability.

One additional note or irritation about the flat, campy characters in this film - why are Hollywood prostitutes always so unrealistic? I'm sure there are high class call girls out there, but none of them are streetwalkers. If you want to write a streetwalker into your script, she needs to be ugly, used up and pretty dumb. The smart call girls put ads on the Internet and you call them on the phone to set up an appointment.

1553108,2,B00005JO16,"I am a huge fan of zombie movies, particularly the Romero done & inspired efforts, so I had high expectations for this film. The first warning bell was the poor box office it did. After I bought the DVD, I saw why. I never connected with this story - it did not resonate the way others, particularly ""Night"" & ""Dawn"" did. I didn't buy into it.

Thinking zombies - naaaah. This stuff bordered on laughingly silly to me. I couldn't relate to the human characters either, and couldn't really root for them. The entire story involving the high-rise w/ Dennis Hopper & Leguizamo & other characters trying to get in, didn't resonate - I didn't like it & didn't care. I found the ""world"" they created in this movie to be uninteresting and unoriginal (don't wanna see Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome in a zombie movie). And the ""zombie mobile"" - ridiculous. The story seems to circle aimlessly in the second act, going nowhere (as they chase that zombie mobile around endlessly). This is worse than ""Day of the Dead"", which previously was the weak link.

Maybe my expectations are too high, but this one lacked the edginess, rawness and scariness that marked the others. Where were the cutting-edge FX - exploding heads and such. The re-made ""Dawn of the Dead"" for example, was a fresh, wild, hip, interesting re-visioning of the original, with scarey moments. But this one proves that sometimes a higher budget does not a better film make. I think the feeling of claustrophobia and ""the unknown"" helped the other films. The city we see in this movie is hard to believe. I hope Romero keeps making zombie movies, but hopefully they'll be better ones than this.",1147046400,,1648,4.679310344827586
1553109,5,B00005JO16,"In the wake of recent successful zombie movies like 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead and even a remake of George A. Romero's own Dawn of the Dead, Universal decided to milk every last drop of rancid milk money out of that zombie teet. Romero was given a reported $15M budget (his biggest ever) to create Land of the Dead, the fourth movie in his ""Dead"" saga.

Like the previous sequels to Night of the Living Dead, none of the characters have returned even though the movie is set in the same post-zombie apocalypse America.

My initial reaction to Land Of The Dead was that it was a pretty good big-budget zombie movie with several magical Romero touches of brilliance. Since it was financed by a Hollywood studio, I felt that Romero probably made some compromises. Hopper and Leguizamo were both great, but most likely were cast because they are well-known stars. Hopper and Leguizamo will always be Hopper and Leguizamo in every movie I see them in. I like them both, but they rarely disappear into a character.

While it's not quite as strong as last year's Shaun of the Dead, I do think Land of the Dead is one of the better zombie movies to come out in recent years. It's easily the 3rd. best movie in Romero's ""Dead"" saga. There's plenty of action and gore for everyone, and I highly recommend seeing this DVD.",1146960000,,1317,4.525210084033613

For Some reason I cant stop looking at ""Land Of The Dead"" as some what of a parody of the films that he has created before. I have to admitt that one of my favorite parts of his zombie movies overall is that the humans have to outsmart the zombies, not beat them through brute strength, so of course I really don't like that in this film the zombies's had reasoning power and even somewhat of a brain. oh well this film is good for a laugh or two and I would recommend it to Romaro fans even though the film is very different from his others, not to shabby

1553111,5,B00005JO16,"I heard many people complaining about ""Land of the Dead"" it's not that intense and breathtaking as recent remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"". Well, ""Dawn"" was made according to all latest cinema innovations and what's more important - trying to please modern viewers' tastes, to live up to their expectations. It was definately made for a wider audiences than all zombie movies are usually made. ""Dawn"" was a perfect action-packed horror film which is interesting not just for horror fans. But George Romero is of an old school breed. I guess no one who knows and enjoys his older films expected anything as spectacular and large-scale as ""Dawn of the Dead"". Romero's films are usually small and not big-budgeted, but there's plenty of sense in them. All his ""Dead"" quadrilogy is a social and political satire and drama camouflaged as horror. Same with ""Land of the Dead"". Romero created this small town where last human survivors are surrounded by hordes of zombies (who by the way are getting smarter as we noticed already in ""Day of the Dead""), thus creating human society in miniature. And guess what - I have no doubt that's exactly what it would look like given the same circumstances as in the movie. Even facing the greatest danger in the history of mankind and being isolated people still can't live in peace with themselves. There are rich who occupy a luxury skyscraper in the center of the town, and there are others who don't have anything to eat or live in, whose dream is to be admitted into this caste of welthy and mighty. And actually zombies here are just an excuse for Romero to show something that matters, to reveal some inadecuacies of our society as it was in his previous three films.
So comparing the remake of ""Dawn"" and ""Land of the Dead"" (which is inevitable since they are the two major zombie flicks made practically at the same time) I'd say that if you want to have fun and see something intense, energetic and rampageous, watch ""Dawn of the Dead"" because you won't find it in ""Land"". Romero's film is more thoughtful and serious although wrapped in a horror pack paper. It's more like ""Day of the Dead"" made not 20 years ago, but nowdays.

1553166,4,B00005JO16,"Thirty-six years after shocking audiences and changing the face of American horror with ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and 20 years after his ambitious but budget-starved third installment ""Day of the Dead,"" George A. Romero returns to the genre he indelibly re-created with the fourth (and surely final) film in his series. This time he has the budget to see his grand vision to the screen.

A pocket of mankind has found refuge in a (literally) gated community, a veritable feudal kingdom called Fiddler's Green where class structure is strictly enforced by its corporate despot (Dennis Hopper). The rich and powerful live in luxury in a glowing glass tower while the underclass is confined to the slums. A militia keeps the poor contained and the city protected from ""the stenches"" (as the rotting undead are called).

Riley (Simon Baker), the leader of the raiding party that scavenges zombie-infested towns for supplies, is fed up with the inequity. No rebel, he's about to abandon the city for the zombie-less frontier of Canada when he's drafted for one last assignment. His second in command (John Leguizamo) has stolen the raiding party's armed and dangerous tank and holds the city for ransom.

To complicate things, the zombies are evolving. They start to learn, to communicate and to organize, and they target the great glass tower as prime noshing grounds.

If Fiddler's Green is America's class disparity through Romero's satirically warped looking glass, then the zombies are the Third World scratching at the borders. Yes, you can only take the metaphors so far, but loaded dialogue like ""We don't negotiate with terrorists"" is constantly delivered with more gusto than necessary (Romero's direction of actors isn't particularly delicate).

Romero embraces the advancements of make-up effects, animatronics and computer-generated imagery enhancements, but at heart he's an old-fashioned storyteller who relies on simple devices. While there is no shortage of slow, shuffling zombies pulling fresh meat from the body human in inventively gory flourishes, the scenes of mass chaos as mankind devours itself -- class conflict gone cannibalistic -- are what define the film.

The social commentary isn't subtle, but Romero delivers the goods so effectively that many won't even notice.",1141344000,,2294,5.288461538461538

1553170,2,B00005JO16,"Ever wonder why there are so many zombie movie franchises?  I do.  Consider that we have the original Dead series (Romero), the Return of the Living Dead series, the Resident Evil series, the Dawn of the Dead remake, 24 Days later (zombie variant), even parodies like Shawn of the Dead.  What is it about zombies that fascinates us?  Certainly there isn't that much to zombies--they basically wander around in a catatonic stupor looking for living human beings so they can eat their flesh.  Its a fairly uncomplicated concept, so its hard to see why its become such a popular and profitable genre.

The answer lies in the fact that zombies scare us on two levels.  On the surface, no one likes the thought of being eaten alive--and then becoming a zombie--wandering around forever in an ignorant and hungry state (kind of like being a perpetual teenager).  However, the more unsettling terror lies in the societal aspect of zombies.  After all, here are these dumb automotons who consistently get the best of us intelligent human beings.  The unspoken (and terrifying) implication here is that our technically advanced and democratic society will fall to (there is no good way to put this) our perceived social inferiors--be they waves of illegal immigrants, Jihadists, or even trailer park trash.

If nothing else, Romero is a genius for pioneering this concept in Dawn of the Dead.  Recall that at the end of Night of the Living Dead, the living had things well in hand.  Yet at the beginning of ""Dawn"", society was beginning to crumble under the relentless unslaught of the dead.  Intelligent human beings weren't able to get their act together due to a combination of the 6D's:  Disbelief, Denial, Despair, Disgust, Distrust, and Disinformation.  As a result, the dumb, but dogged zombies won the day and, literally, took over the world.  The implicit message is that the stupid will inherit the Earth--and it is a terrifying message indeed.  And it has happened before--remember the Roman Empire's fate?

That being said, Land of the Dead has its problems.  Romero is a lot less subtle with his social commentary than he was in previous films.  This can be either good or bad depending on your perspective--personally, I found it a little patronizing.  What Romero seems to be saying is that our society has rotted from within and must be destroyed so something better can take its place.  The rulers of the city are portrayed as terminally greedy, stupid, and shortsighted, while the zombies are painted in a sympathetic light.  Romero seems to be telling us that the zombies (e.g, the Third World) are more deserving of our prosperity than we are. The film provides no coherent argument for this assertion.  If the zombies control the Earth, then why are they so envious of the strip of land that humans still inhabit?  Perhaps the intended target audience for this movie are guilt-ridden liberals--if so, Romero certainly hit that bullseye.  But, for the rest of us, I suspect ""Land"" is a downer without redemption.",1140825600,3,3023,4.911242603550296
1553171,4,B00005JO16,"George Romero, at first, crafted what are commonly considered to be the two greatest horror movies of all time, and in interviews with many filmmakers, from the low-budget to Sam Raimi himself, they consider one or both of these movies to be one of their primary sources of inspiration.

When compared to the 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', in particular, 'Land of the Dead' is more conventional, bringing us characters who are either just or corrupt, rather than stylish like before.  However, when compared to 1985's 'Day of the Dead', the new 'Land of the Dead' seems like a miracle of a movie.  I really enjoyed 'Land of the Dead' really for 2 reasons - 1) It has some good original effects and action elements, and 2) It partially makes up for the godawful 'Day'.

If I were to be asked if I enjoyed the storyline, I would find myself torn in two.  One one hand, the story makes little sense.  After an amazing sequence depicting human survivors raiding a dead town, taking anything they can use for survival, it turns into a political movie not about just corruption, but about greed.  The fact that we are asked to believe that money still holds value when humanity has been forced to live in one major city (or otherwise die out) is frankly quite outrageous.

The story is half about a rather realistic depiction of how the strong would survive in a world where, apart from one city, the world is covered with the dead, but the other half revolves around this political corruption that really took up too much of the plot.  It's like the corruption is the clothesline, while the well thought-out zombie vs. human scenes are in support of it.  It should have been in reverse.

However, there were many little moments that I did like.  The first being that when the humans would move into a city, they would launch fireworks, because the zombies couldn't take their eyes off of them.  I also thought that the zombies having a leader (really just one brain among them) was well done, as he wasn't just smarter, but figured things out via basic logic and trial and error.  He didn't learn how to fire a gun, for example, by watching or a distant memory, but by grabbing one, and accidently squeezing the trigger.

This smart zombie was I think given a tad too much credit, as we were asked, in the end, to sort of side with him.  I didn't distinctly mind the end, where it looked like he was commanding the zombies to live in seperation from the humans (ie peace, as both have the power to destroy the other), but since it comes right after a, frankly, overly-brutal climax, I thought it was a tad sudden.  I had to think about it for a little while before I could accept it.  However, I did feel some emotion from him.

You see, the humans, in this future, don't just kill the zombies, they like to torment, torture, and slaughter the zombies in the thousands.  Sure, if all the zombies do is attack you and kill you whenever they get the chance, why wouldn't the humans treat the zombies as an enemy in a full scale war?  But with a smarter zombie, I could see that whenever he saw the humans taunting them and beating them, seemingly not for survival but for fun, he should feel anger.

He's not smart like a human, and this is why I liked him.  You could tell that he knew he wasn't as smart as the humans that would kill him for sport, as well as those of his kind, and I could feel a genuine burning frustration and fury coming from him.  Despite that his kind has pretty much driven humanity to just one city, he is, on his own, helpless.

But enough of the story.  The movie is also hit or miss on man other levels, but I personally found it more solid on the other levels.

To start off, the screenplay is acceptable.  The dialogue is rather quick moving and doesn't fall into the holes that many other screenplays can commonly fall into.  The main characters, while not deep, are at least believable enough and can carry the movie.  The cinematography is rather good, and some scenes in the night are nice and chilling.  However, frankly, I found the human vs. zombie climax to not only be somewhat lacking, but also poorly shot and edited.  It was also too fast - it was like they gave Michael Bay caffine pills, Red Bull, and only like $10K to shoot a climax.

The editing overall was rather good, although nothing special by any means.  The musical score I thought was well composed and arranged, however, and some of the choir-pieces towards the end were amazing.  The production design was also well done, but honestly I think that the production design being grand and the cinematography being tight sorta clashed.  Both were competant on their own, but during the more intense moments, didn't work well together.  The digital effects, especially when combined with the well-done lighting and exellent make-up, were very good.  It's amazing that this movie commonly looked better than Titanic, when Titanic had a budget literally 10x this.

Lastly, the acting was rather good as well.  Simon Baker does well as a good man hardened by the war against the dead.  John Leguizamo plays more of a 'character', trying to be cooler, and while I didn't like that his character was more of a stereotype, I thought he handled it quite well actually.  Lastly, Dennis Hopper is really like the nice ring that won't fit on the finger - his performance for the character is good, but the fact that his character is the epicenter of greed and corruption in this world where greed and corruption shouldn't exist in the ways they do in this movie, I thought it was sort of a lost cause.

Overall, this is a rather well done and sometimes clever movie.  I think this movie was more cursed of having come out at the wrong time.  The 2004 remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' proved that the genre can be high quality, and movies like 'Resident Evil' and 'House of the Dead' made it so that the genre quickly became unpopular again.  After 2004's 'Dawn' and the genuinely smart 'Shaun of the Dead', I thought that there was nowhere left for the genre to go.  Romero didn't create something new, but it was good enough to sit back and watch, and it had enough clever ideas to separate itself from the others.  I just wish that Romero would stop ending his movies with a morale that humanity isn't really worth saving.  At least here he said: ""We are a corrupt kind, but there just might be hope.""",1140134400,,6380,4.506086956521739

1553215,4,B00005JO16,"Horror movies almost always make money. It's an easy formula: create a monster, cast attractive people, and then have the monster kill them. All you really have to do is make people jump once or twice and your job's finished. It's also why most horror films are terrible. Land of the Dead, while not perfect, manages to be a unique horror film, because it believes horror movies can do something other than make people jump in their seat, although it does that too.

Land of the Dead is the fourth film in George A. Romero's Dead series. While the previous films involved the eventual decline of civilization, this film revolves around the last remnants of humanity trying to create a new civilization. The only problem is that the new civilization looks a lot like the old. In fact, it looks a lot like ours. Land of the Dead is a straight ahead allegory. It's not quite a mirror image of today's political climate, but it's awfully close. This is both a strength and weakness of Land of the Dead.

The plot revolves around a group of raiders who make a living going into the outlining suburbs and ransacking them for supplies. After a night of raiding, Cholo (John Leguizamo) decides that it's his last. He wants to buy his way into Fiddler's Green, a high rise building where all of the affluent live surrounded by the poor throngs, like Cholo, who work for them. When the owner of Fiddler's Green, Kaufman (Dennis Hoffman), makes it clear isn'tt Cholo isn't the kind of person who can live at Fiddler's Green, Cholo steals Kaufman's specialized armor vehicle Dead Reckoning. Cholo threatens to fire off Dead Reckoning's missiles at Fiddler's Green if he isn't paid five-million by midnight. Riley, one of Cholo's fellow raiders, is enlisted by Kaufman to find Cholo and stop him before the midnight deadline.

Oh, and there's a side plot about the zombies (often called stenches) starting to gain the ability to think.

The analogy is there for anyone looking. Cholo starkly states that he's performing ""jihad,"" and when he hears the demands Kaufman says he doesn't ""negotiate with terrorists."" Romero is examining how marginalizing certain groups causes dissatisfaction and anger to boil over into violence. There are many examples of this around the world, and one of the most recent were the riots in France. While Romero never asks us to like Cholo, he does expect us to understand why he's doing what he's doing.

I enjoy it when escapist fair tackles more serious subject matter. While they can never truly probe the problems as deeply as a more dramatic piece, the effect of recontextualizing real world problems in a fantasy setting can help us see things in a new light. It may never give us answers, but may help us tackle a problem from the flank rather than head on. catharsis certain amount of catharcis in seeing such serious issues cut to their essence and treated as escapism. Such a blatantly political theme in a horror movie is brave to say the least.

The problem with the film is also its strength. At times the allegory becomes stretched. A ready example is when Riley chooses not to fire on a band of zombies because they're just trying to ""find their way."" I know the zombies are there to symbolize the marginalized people outside of our boarders, but c'mon, they're freaking' zombies! Heck, they were just eating people! Maybe Romero feels that his message is too urgent not to shove it in our face, and while I can understand this proposition I feel it hurts his art. Romero was able to insert his political message into Dawn of the Dead in a less labored manner.

That being said, Romero does a fine job of creating a world out of a tiny budget. Seeing how much people can do with a small budget used to be one of the highlights of horror films. Would The Evil Dead be as good if you didn't know that it was filmed in a few months with virtually no budget and no experienced filmmakers? Now that horror movies are becoming less ambitious and special effects cheaper, I haven't seen a movie try and stretch a budget anymore. Romero does a fine job and adds a few details here and there that show you why he's so good in the first place. The first shot in the film is a diner sign spelling ""eats.""  It's a clever bit of dark humor in a film about flesh-eating zombies. This may seem like an odd thing to say, but the gore is gleeful in its excess. When an army officer tries to throw a grenade, a zombie chops off his arm causing him to fall onto his own explosive and blow up. It's deliciously twisted. There are several scenes of gore that are painful to watch not because of the amoung of blood, but because they focus on things you could imagine actually hurting. You'll know them when you see them. Romero goes out of his way to show us things we've never seen in a zombie movie before.

While not on the level of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead should satisfy Romero fans. It's almost enough for me to forget the awful Dawn of the Dead remake.

1553252,2,B00005JO16,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am a longtime fan of George Romero's zombie flicks... I first saw ""Night Of The Living Dead"" in 1975, and have been a devoted enthusiast ever since.  I think the sequels are good, too, and each followed up on the subversive political satire of the original.

However, I also have to count myself among those who found this fourth Romero flick to be a bit, well, ""dead.""  I really wanted to like it, and rented it despite the numerous well-reasoned, well-balanced reviews by other Amazon customers who panned it...  Sadly, it's true: the script is weak, the action is flat, and the theme -- that the zombies, having proved capable of learning and adaptive behavior in the previous film, are now able to organize themselves as a coherent social force -- isn't explored in a terribly interesting way.  Much of the dramatic heft is given over to two terrible hams, Dennis Hopper and John Leguziamo, and although the ""good"" good guys have some likeable characters, there's still not much in the way of compelling character development.  Perhaps in another five years Romero will come back yet again with a film in which the zombies have established a new civilzation and become a political force to be reckoned with, and that could be a cool story... But Romero might do well to hire an outside writer (Joss Whedon, perhaps?) who could bring a little more life into the series.  This film was the first real dud.",1135209600,6,1443,4.7023809523809526
1553253,1,B00005JO16,"Last year, in December I wrote a review on this movie.  I since deleted that review.  In that review I explained how I rented this movie on cable for $3.99 and shut it off after 15 minutes or so.  Well, recently they are running it for free on HBO so I decided to give it a try and this time stick with the whole movie from beginning to end.  Man, I did the right thing back then, but not now!!!  I watched every stinking frame of this loser of a movie.  It's so ridiculous.  I'd like to just forget he made this stupid movie and remember the 3 dead movies as they were.  Night, Dawn and Day.  In fact, I think I'll do that.  I highly recommend you NOT see this movie as it is a complete waste of time and disappointment!!",1134345600,2,722,4.02112676056338

1553255,1,B00005JO16,"Like most of the other reviewers, I love zombie films.  I grew up watching Romero's original trilogy. This movie was a massive disappointment. It violated the number one rule of ANY movie: it was boring. I saw this film in the theater and by the time of the ""climatic"" finale, I was ready to get up and walk out.  I never liked any of these character, so their fate didn't really matter to me. Having half the cast of Super Mario Brothers didn't help.  The political overtones were so heavy that they were comical.  I see movies to be entertained, not to be indoctrinated with the directors politics.  This was a commentary on the ""rich"" (read into this the United States) taking what we will from less fortunates (in this case a zombie town). As a result of ""war crimes"" on the zombie populace, a smart zombie with BAD Buffy the Vampire Slayer make-up takes the fight back to the rich people.  Did I mention this smart zombie worked in a gas station? Hello, oil!  So this zombie terrorist (who I'm sure would be considered by Romero as a ""freedom fighter"") comes and kills the guilty evil rich people (King Koopa).  The Everyman who is supposed to be the hero decides NOT to kill the zombies in the end and just lets them go.  What the HELL is that about? THESE ARE ZOMBIES.  All in all this movie was so stupid I can't imagine a ""director's cut"" being any better.  Poor acting, boring plot and a hamfisted attempt at political commentary.",1134000000,17,1440,4.478927203065134
1553256,4,B00005JO16,"George Romero returns to his living dead zombie world.  The film opens well after the advent of the Zombies.  A section of city bordered by rivers has been walled off from the hungry corpses.  But in this haven there is a vast class distinction with the upper crust living in the towering Fiddler's Green while the rest are in squalor.  [...]  With the survival of the living hanging in the balance and power slipping into the wrong hands the story really works.

If you have enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, you will probably like this one.  The gore factor is high but not as blatant as in some movies of this ilk.  It is an odd movie because you find yourself wanting the thinking zombie to continue to solve problems.  I don't know if it is because it means that death and zombiedom might not be final or what, but it is a strange feeling.  Good acting by the cast also helps the movie succeed.  All in all I had a fun time watching it and was surprised at how good it was.",1133913600,,970,4.245901639344262
1553257,4,B00005JO16,"Back when George Romero made, Night of the Living Dead No one had even made a zombie film like that before. Zombies were just benevolent brain-dead creatures, and not blood thirsty carnivores. It was a bold and innovative move to make something so different. The thing is if the people who watched it back then had the same narrow attitude as todays movie goers. The zombie genre wouldn't even exist because people would reject it for stepping outside an established perception. The stretch from Night of the Living Dead to Land of the Dead isn't as great as that if you think about it. In NIGHT... zombies pick up rocks and sticks to use them as weapons, one even picks up a trowel and stabs someone to death with it. Yet so many can't accept that line being crossed.  Why not a thinking zombie? They were caused by radiation from a contaminated space probe. Who's to say what would happen with continuous exposure? But the sixties were an innovative and progressive time. Today everyone is afraid of stepping out of the land of familiar. I could go on, but why bother? Nobody is listening. All I'd add is that if you don't like this movie then you may be the living dead. A passionless creature pretending to be alive. Someone who lives in a tiny constricted world. Or at least move your old man's heart down to Florida with all the other geezers.",1133913600,3,1349,4.551440329218107

The only thing that I didn't care for was that we were back to the slow moving zombies. With the recent movies such as Dawn of the Dead, we've gotten spoiled with the fast, more menacing zombies which are way scarier. This could have been a much better movie with a different cast and a darker, scarier screenplay. John Leguizano sucks! He really should stick with comedy (loved him to death on Too Wong Foo) and Dennis Hooper needs to just give it up.

1553336,1,B00005JO16,"Where did Land of the Dead go wrong? When the writer decided to ""evolve"" the zombie. The zombies in this movie are led by a ""smart"" zombie (which was a gas station attendant in his former life, gee...he must've been the most intelligent human being on the planet. Of course he's the smartest zombie? Right?), which leads them around obsticles, uses a firearm and communicates with his fellow zombies by using a crude form of grunts and moans.

What would really happen to mindless zombies, unable to feed themselves on anything other than brains? They would starve. The laws of physics don't allow a creature to exist indefinitely on nothing at all. But in Land of the Dead, the undead are becoming smarter, and getting ready to start their own nation! Give me a break.

In one scene, the good guys have all sorts of firearms trained on a large group of zombies. Even though the zombies have just killed dozens of innocent people, the humans decide to let them go, because the zombies appear to be retreating. Give me a break! That is so unrealistic it's rediculous.

The tiny group of humans, last remaining people on the planet, are crammed into a single city. Still, they are divided into rich and poor and struggle for resources. You would think that wiping out over 99 percent of the people on the planet would free up a few resources so they wouldn't have to fight over them. Morality and goodness among these people is almost nonexistant. Only one person, the main character, has any sense of right and wrong. Once again, this is dumb.

Why are smart zombies a bad idea? Because the whole point of a zombie movie is that you have these hordes of mindless cannibals after your brains and it's easy to outsmart, outfight and shoot them. Change them to ""smart"" zombies and you might as well just make a gangster flick where everyone knows how to fight.

This is one movie I kept looking at my watch throughout in the theatre, thinking, ""God, is it over yet?"" I couldn't wait to leave the theatre! I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star reviews this movie has received, so I am giving it the old 1 star, which is what it deserves.

1553337,5,B00005JO16,"This is a really good movie. The unrated dvd has four more minutes more. This won't dissapoint any Romero fan. I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of the Land of the Dead Unrated Edition DVD.

  IMAGE:

Presented in a 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen, Land of the Dead is passable, but not good by any strecth of the imagination. Part of the problem is, being a zombie film, it's set mostly at night which eliminates a lot of fine detail. But in better-lit scenes, like inside the tower, the amount of grain visible is overly distracting. The entire print looks soft and slightly out of focus, and colors aren't all that vibrant. Nothing will pop off the screen at you, but I don't think it diminishes from the film. Black levels are solid and flesh tones look accurate.

  SOUND:

I always know when I've got a good audio trach because my neighbors will ask,""What were you watching last night that had so much bass?"" The dts 5.1 audio track on "" Land of the Dead""is one of those. The sound is wonderfully spread out through all five main channels,gunfire and zombie moans come out with excellent localization and the dynamic range on the track is stellar. Dialogue is crisp and clean.

  SPECIAL FEATURES:

Undead Again:The making of Land of the Dead, is a fluffy retroospective on how each member of the cast came to be a part of the feature, their experiences and thoughts on George Romero, and the film. There isn't a lot of substance, but a few good peaks behind the scenes.

John Leguizamo hosts a tour behind the scenes called ""A Day with the Dead"". Leguizamo riffs on working with zombies and we get a few good shots of zombies being ceated.

Bringing the Dead to Life, goes through the effects process of creating and summarliy destroying the undead. This is my favorite practical feature on the DVD set.

The Remaining Bits, are, Deleted Scenes. They are presented without context,effects, or final sound cues. They look nice, though.

George Romero, edito Micheal Daugherty and producer Peter Grunwald sit down to discuss the final film during a feature-lenth commentary. The discussion isn't lively, and there are quite a few blank spaces, but the crew does present some good information on the stories, the structure, andthe history of zombies in film.

Simon Peg, star of Shaun of the Dead, drops by the set of""Land of the Dead"" for a cameo in the film. When Shaun met George is a short video that details their meeting and scene in the film.

Scenes of Carnage, are..well..two minutes of that.

From Green to Screen, is a feature that compares before and after sspecial effects shots, with and without effects added in. It's pretty neat to see what a movie looks like to the director and crew on set as compared to what we see in the end, and what a leap of faith it must be some times to hoppe it all turns out.

The story boards and final scenes are compared with the final audio track, for those who enjoy the conceptual process.

The final extra feature is a selection of..well..dancing zombies in Toronto that has to be seen to believe.

1553338,5,B00005JO16,"First, I must say that this next review is not about the movie itself, its more about the people who critized it without knowing what there are talking about.

1. All the people who said that the Dawn of the Dead remake, 28 days later or Resident Evil are better: Shut the F*** up.... Romero invented the modern zombie, so you should all kiss his a**. Before him it was just the soulless voodoo type zombie. Without him zombie movies wouldn't even exist.

2. In an other review, some dumba** said that the zombies wasn't realistic enough and Romero went to Viet-nam so he must have known how cadavers looks like.: Romero never went to Viet-nam stupid moron, Tom Savini did. Romero did Night of the living Dead in 1967, There's always vanilla in 1971, season of the witch in 1972, The crazies in 1973. How the guy was supposed to fight in Viet-nam and make those movies at the same time, DUH?!!. And for the records, Tom Savini didn't do the effects on this film, Greg Nicotero did, and he did a great job. At least his zombies are not CGI. He learn from Tom Savini himself, so it can't be bad.

3. ""This is stupid, the zombies are using guns"": TWO OF 'EM, Big Daddy and the number 9 softball palyer girl. Two on 150 zombies, big deal!!! If you had watch Night, you'll see that zombies are using rocks and table legs to break into the house, so they began to think right away.

4.""Zombies are supposed to be dumb"": WHO SAYS. In Romero story, the dead are afflicted with a disease. Its like their brains turned off then restarted by an unknown force, so they have to learn how to live again. That's logical.

5. ""How the zombies are so fresh after more than thirty years"": The serie went on for more than thirty years, not the story. Land of the Dead is set about seven years after the begining of the plague. If you were smart enough to watch the first three, you'll notice one scene in Day of the Dead when Sarah enters doctor logan's laboratory, he is saying in his magnetophone: The state of decomposition of the subjects slow down. It would take 10 to 12 years before the body would be incapacitated to function. There's an anwser.

6. Running zombies is the worst idea ever: Never heard of the rigor mortis effect. There is no more blood flow to the muscles, so they get stiff. The same about the articulations. Never wonder why the undertakers cuts the back the clothes for the dead people. Try to turn over a 200 pounds guy when you're not able to bend him.

Those are few points that shows why Remero is ahead of everybody in the zombie genre and there's alot more. From 2004 to 2007, George Romero will be the most remaked and copied director of all time: Dawn of the Dead remake, the future Dawn of the Dead 2, Day of the Dead 2: contagium, the future Day of the Dead remake, the future Creepshow 3 and Creepshow remake, the fuure The Crazies remake, The future Night of the living Dead remake in 3-D.... And there's probably more to come. Land of the Dead is way better than the new Star Wars or the crappy War of the Worlds starring psycho Tom Cruise. It shows that George Romero is one of the best american movie maker still alive. Despite the fact that he is always in the shadow of steven speilberg and george lucas or even martin scorcese, George Romero can actually do something with nothing, Night of the living Dead was his first full lenght film made with a hundred thousand bucks and it became a classic. None of those directors made an impact that big at there debut. So every time you'll see a movie, a book, a video game, etc... Showing flesh eating, slow moving rotting corpses... You'll know that there is only one man behind it.... The Great George Romero!",1132963200,7,3682,4.3979441997063144
1553339,2,B00005JO16,"This is an unnecessary movie really. It beats me why Romero felt like making another zombiemovie after I watched it. The story line of the dead picking up some human tricks like shooting guns looks very silly. I think last year's remake of Dawn of the dead should have been a nice conclusion of the zombiemovies for the next 10 years. This movie isn't even scary anymore...it is like watching an action movie with zombies. Was this Romero's attempt to show everyone he still can make a better zombiemovie then any other director? If so, he shouldn't have bothered. (SARR)",1132704000,7,571,4.72

1553342,5,B00005JO16,"""Kaufman's gotta pay. If he doesn't, he knows I'm going to do a jihad on his ass.""

If we didn't know Land of the Dead was George Romero's latest look at zombified America (""They're mindless walking corpses""), the reference to ""jihad"" spoken by the ""terrorist"" played by John Leguizamo tells us that Romero has resurrected the dead again, and brought them up to date - - to September 11 and the so-called ""war on terror."" (As I write this, Congress is preparing to throw out the constitution in favor of the so-called Patriot Act. Was it Benjamin Franklin who said that people who abandon liberty for apparent security deserve neither?)

(Spoilers ahead, but Romero's corporophagous movies unfold with the inevitability of Sophoclean tragedy. There aren't too many surprises. That's one reason Romero's films are so much better than most other zombie movies, especially idiotic comedies like Shaun of the Dead.)

A community of the dead are trying to recreate the lives they had before the change. They shuffle around their small town like the inhabitants of Santa Mira after the pods took over in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

A special ops team from Fiddler's Green, an enclave for the wealthy living, raids the zombie town at night. They distract the dead with ""skyflowers"" - - fireworks that look like a Fourth of July celebration. One of the soldiers has an American flag flapping on his motorcycle as he fires bullets into zombie brains. Like political leaders before the change, the people who run Fiddler's Green (fiddling while the world burns?) know that if you distract the masses with enough patriotic shows, flags, and vicious country songs, they'll let you do whatever you want.

One of the zombies used to work in or own a gas station, and that's where he is when the soldiers from Fiddler's Green attack, trying to work his gas pump. (This whole war couldn't be over oil, could it?) After the soldiers destroy a lot of his fellow zombies, he starts to think for himself. He leads the dead to the people who sent the raiders, to Fiddler's Green.

On the outskirts of the shiny condo heaven of Fiddler's Green (reminiscent of the mall in Dawn of the Dead) there's a suburb of the living poor who provide the army, prostitutes, and workers that keep the economy of Fiddler's Green running.

Kaufman in charge. (As his name makes clear, Kaufman buys, sells, and disposes of things and people.) There's a police force that keeps order in the suburb, like the police that keeps order in the banlieues that encircle Paris. But so far no one's setting cars on fire outside Fiddler's Green to protest living conditions. But there is a group of revolutionaries trying to take power from Kaufman and get some of the advantages of Fiddler's Green for themselves.

Riley is a soldier who's tired of killing the dead (as Kaufman says, in a world where the dead come to life and devour the living, words lose their meaning). Riley tells his slow-witted partner that a rifle shot was accurate, but not ""nice."" ""There's no such thing as nice shooting,"" Riley says.

There's an interesting reference to Sergeant York, the Howard Hawks movie starring Gary Cooper. Sergeant York is about pacifism vs. violence, and whether the government can command citizens to fight in a war. Land of the Dead deals with similar issues, though I think Romero comes to a different conclusion than Hawks. Riley's partner always licks his thumb and wets his rifle sight before firing, the way country boy York did when he shot turkeys before going into the army in World War I. In the trenches, York used the same technique to shoot Germans.

Cholo is a soldier who becomes a ""terrorist,"" threatening Fiddler's Green with rocket attack if Kaufman doesn't give him five million dollars.

Meanwhile the dead leader from the gas station in zombie town is teaching his people how to use weapons too. This zombie leader brings his people to the river that the inhabitants of Fiddler's Green think will protect them and he jumps in. Later, on the other side of the river, his head slowly rises out of the water, like Martin Sheen as the CIA assassin in Apocalypse Now.  When the zombie army comes out of the river behind him, you realize they WALKED across the river to Fiddler's Green. After all, the dead don't breathe.

Riley recaptures the tank-like fighting vehicle Cholo was going to shell Fiddler's Green with (unlike a lot of the US equipment in Iraq, this one has enough armor to keep the enemy out). The vehicle's sensors show Riley that in trying to keep the dead from their shores, the people of Fiddler's Green have trapped themselves: ""The wall that was built to keep people safe is going to trap them inside.""

Meanwhile, the dead have learned a couple of other things that make them not much different than the living. When one of the dead is set on fire, the zombie leader shoots him in the head to put him out of his misery, just as the living do when one of them is bitten by a zombie (and as Riley did to his own brother).

And by now the dead have learned to ignore the skyflowers sent up by the rich living to distract them from their own situation. As the dead break through the last fence of Fiddler's Green, it looks like fireworks will save the living again. Only this time the dead lower their eyes from the sky and stare straight at the living - - those who think they own the earth.

There is a society divided into the have and the have nots.  The haves live in blissful ignorance of the have nots and their struggles, which is mostly of the zombie variety.  This is a little too on the nose to be subtext, and Romero seems self aware of what he is 'supposed' to be saying in his films.

The highlights are the evolution of the zombie concept [here they can learn and retain reflexive behavior from their past life], and Dennis Hopper's wicked performance as CEO of the new Corporate America.",1132099200,3,780,4.664233576642336

Really, I have been noticing how there are so many movies lately that are only filmed with a combination of blue on top of black.  No other colors show through except extreme amounts of red will penetrate the dominating blue color and sometimes even green when they showed a computer screen.

This is annoying.  I suspect it has something to do with filming in the dark and being too lazy to overcome whatever technicalities it takes to actually create movies set in the dark properly in color.

As for the movie, I don't see any progression in this.  I should know better but I always watch these stupid movies hoping that they get creative and comedic with the gore.

1553393,1,B00005JO16,"Being a fan of the horror and zombie genre, I loved ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"".  However, the last 2 movies have been uninspired, and not intense.  With the first 2 movies, I was involved with the characters, and could not wait to see what happened next.  This latest film had me bored from the very beginning, and I love zombie movies.

  The characters were very unbelievable, and the scenes even more so.  For example:

1.  At the beginning of the movie, characters from the city are in a suburb looking for food and supplies.  John Leguzamo's character and 2 others go into a liquor store to get liquor of course.  They check the opening room of the store, and then drop their guard and start getting the goods.  No, do not worry about checking behind the counter, much less the store room in the back.  Sure enough, a zombie crashes through some glass to attack one of the guys...  Just dumb.

2.  When the zombies finally break into the glass building where the ""elite"" are staying, people all of a sudden are moving like they have cement in their shoes.  The zombies are at the window for like a minute, and there is no one around except the security guards.  Then in the next scene, the zombies are in side chasing and grabbing the high class citizens.  Is it just me, or if I saw a hungry zombie about to break in, I would be running the opposite way.  To me, just dumb.

  And those are just 2 examples....

  The best part of the movie were the zombies tearing into the people...  guts being pulled out, a tongue pulled away from a person, and a face being peeled over a head are some of the examples.. the makeup effects are great.  And in the unrated version, the blood is flowing.

  Instead of wasting your money on this movie, go buy or re-rent Dawn of the Dead.  And no, not the remade one !",1132012800,9,1831,4.3097345132743365
1553394,5,B00005JO16,"Recent years have seen a resurgence in the zombie film with the good (28 Days Later), the bad (Resident Evil) and the funny (Shaun of the Dead), but all of them pale in comparison to George A. Romero's trilogy of zombie films. The first two have been remade already, most recently it was Dawn of the Dead and both failed to build on or even recapture what made Romero's films so great in the first place. They seem to only be in love with the gore and miss (or just didn't understand) the socio-political message of them. The good news is that Romero is back with a new zombie movie that has been years in the making but it was well worth the wait.

Romero has crafted a very smart horror movie which is something of a rarity these days what with all of these lames remakes littering the landscape. Land of the Dead has all of the requisite gore (and the unrated version has even more) while actually trying to say something. There are plenty of powerful images, like the undead rising out of the water at night (a nice nod to Carnival of Souls, one of the films that inspired Night of the Living Dead) or zombies crashing through the posh apartment complex and feasting on the wealthy. Like with his other zombie films, Land of the Dead is a commentary on the times in which it was made. And for that alone, his movie is a refreshing breath of fresh air.

""Undead Again: The Making of Land of the Dead"" is a promo puff piece as the cast and crew gush about Romero who looks like he is having a blast getting to play with a significant budget and working with name actors like Dennis Hopper. Unfortunately, the more substantial making of doc that aired on IFC is absent from this disc.

""A Day with the Living Dead"" features actor John Leguizamo taking us on a tour of the set and shamelessly mugging for the camera.

""Bringing the Dead to Life"" takes a look at how all of the nasty gore effects are done. Make-up guru Greg Nicotero demonstrates why he is probably the best zombie effects guy since Tom Savini. Nicotero went all out with this film to create some truly astounding (and unsettling) effects.

""The Remaining Bits"" is a collection of deleted footage that is only just little bits of business amounting to three minutes. While hardly essential it would've been nice to know why it was cut.

There is an audio commentary by Romero, producer Peter Grunwald and editor Michael Daughtery. Romero delivers a typically low key track. He's not quite as chatty as he has been on other commentaries but this is a newer film and he doesn't have the same kind of distanced perspective that he has on his other work. This results in several brief lulls between insightful comments.

""When Shaun Met George"" chronicles the classic meeting of Romero and Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright who made Shaun of the Dead, an excellent satire on Romero's zombie movies. This is an amusing featurette that follows the boys as they film their cameo for the movie, showing their transformation into the undead and basically living out every fanboy's dream.

""Scenes of Carnage"" is a brief montage of some of the film's most gruesome scenes scored lovingly to classical music.

""Zombie Effects: From Green Screen to Finished Scene"" shows a few scenes before CGI was added and after. It was used mostly to flesh out the backgrounds in the scenes, making them look more elaborate or amping up the gore a bit more.

""Bring the Storyboards to Life"" cuts between storyboard drawings and the final version or a few sequences in the movie.

Finally, there is ""Scream Tests: Zombie Casting Call,"" a pointless clip showing the early CGI tests of zombies dancing around a la the undead in Michael Jackson's music video ""Thriller.""",1132012800,6,3701,4.592424242424243
1553395,4,B00005JO16,"So what's George Romero, writer and director of Night of the Living Dead (1968), Dawn of the Dead (1978), and Day of the Dead (1985) been doing for the last, oh, 20 years?  Well, not a heck of a lot, according to his credits...a few films here and there, a couple of remakes, and so on...but would he ever return with another film in the `Dead' series?  That's what most of us wanted to know, `most of us' being fans of his past work...rumors swirled for years, perpetuated by the fan rags and later websites, but there seemed little in the way of any real concrete information...until, I believe, the summer of 2004, when the deal was signed between Romero and Universal to make another `Dead' film...for better or worse...written and directed by George Romero, Land of the Dead (2005) features Simon Baker (L.A. Confidential, The Ring Two), John Leguizamo (Super Mario Bros., Romeo + Juliet), and Dennis Hopper (Speed, Waterworld).  Also appearing is Asia Argento (B. Monkey, xXx), Robert Joy (Ragtime, Amityville 3-D), and Eugene Clark (Turn It Up, Wilder).

As the story, set in the present, begins, we learn the living dead phenomena has spread worldwide, forcing people to seek refuge within outposts, some utilizing geographic boundaries such as rivers (such as the one in this film) to maintain a perimeter from the hungry dead, or `stenchers', as they're referred throughout the film (presumably because they smell bad, a result of the rotting flesh and poor hygiene skills).  Within this one particular enclave, there are two classes, the wealthy, which populate a shiny skyscraper called `Fiddler's Green', and the laborers who live in the slums around the building (they basically do all the day to day work to keep Fiddler's Green running).  I suppose the zombies themselves could be considered a third class, sort of the disenfranchised rabble, but anywhoo...the city seems to depend on raiding parties that scour the surrounding, zombie infested small communities for supplies, with a fellow by the name of Riley (Baker) overseeing the operation, his second in command being Cholo (Leguizamo).  Turns out this is both Riley and Cholo's last foray, as Riley is planning on heading north, while Cholo, sort of a lacky for the man (the man being Mr. Kaufman played by Hopper), is planning on taking residence in the opulent Fiddler's Green community.  Well, events conspire to spoil both men's plans, as Riley's deal falls through, and the slightly sleazy Cholo's given the runaround by the bigoted (among other things) Kaufman (heck, even I knew the brown skinned Cholo had no chance in hell of gaining entry into the highly exclusive community).  Anyway, Cholo hijacks the Dead Reckoning, a heavily armored, packed with weapons (including missiles), battle wagon designed by Riley to not only defending the city, but also assist in the raiding parties in dealing with the zombies (think of it like that personnel carrier from the 1986 movie Aliens, only bigger, but not as sophisticated).  Cholo now threatens to use the weapons against Fiddler's Green, unless Kaufman pays up, but Kaufman has other plans as he makes a deal with Riley to take Cholo out...oh, by the way, the zombies have begin to develop rudimentary cognitive abilities and are mobilizing, preparing to march on the city...

If you're just interested in the bloody entrails spewing, bone gnawing, flesh peeling (there's a particularly memorable scene where a victim gets his face peeled off), blood spurting, limb-rendering gore often found in movies like this, then this is definitely a solid four star film.  The special effects teams did really amazing work with not only the make up, but also the nastier bits, many of which I've already eluded to...I've seen worse (the 1980 film Cannibal Holocaust, for one), but the visceral action is still pretty heavy duty here, especially for the uninitiated...and I do believe `Unrated Edition', which has about four minutes of extra footage, features extended sequences of these grisly scenes, pared down for the theatrical release.  Now on to the stuff that didn't suit me...I guess it was sort of natural to expect an evolution of the zombies (or else a gimmick to differentiate this film from the others), in terms of them developing very simplistic, cognitive skills, but I didn't swing that way...zombies have always been a mindless automaton horde with one goal, to eat the flesh of the living.  They're not good, they're not evil, they just are...inuring them with certain sensibilities, as was done here, seemed wrong, unnecessary, and pointless.  Romero's `Dead' films have generally stuck to a formula, featuring imagery reflecting the quasi-sociological atmosphere of the time, but here seems more obvious than before, as the undead begin to organize, ultimately revolting against the unjust treatment heaped on them low these many years...rise up my desiccated, rotting brethren, and fight the power!  Fight the power and eat the brains!  Whatever...I don't mind that filmmakers infuse their own ideas and beliefs into their stories, but find a way to do it so it doesn't screw things up.  Everyone's got an agenda, just be wary how you foist it upon your audience.  As far as the characters go, the only one I cared for was Asia Argento's as Slack, and that was only because she was very easy on the eyes, and not because hers was actually an interesting character.  Did anyone like Simon Baker's character?  I thought he was annoying, wishy washy, and I doubt he would have survived as long as he did in a world populated with the undead.  Supposedly he was responsible for the vehicle Dead Reckoning, a highly sophisticated battlewagon, yet he's unable to secure a simple automobile to leave the city.  This guy seemed hardly the hero, but more like a secondary character, one who dies a nasty, hurty death early on...as far as Leguizamo, I'm still hurting from that role of his as Luigi Mario in Super Mario Bros. (1993).  Some wounds never heal...Hopper plays his role surprisingly subdued, which was a refreshing change of pace from his normally overblown, over the top villain characters seen in films like Waterworld (1995)...oh wait, Hopper also appeared with Leguizamo in Super Mario Bros., as King Koopa...the nightmare continues...overall I enjoyed the film, and the action was paced well throughout, the effects amazing and brutal, with the story lacking, and the characters disposable.  My favorite scene had to be the zombies rising from the river...very spooky.  As far as my rating goes, 3 stars for the film, and one extra for the special features and a decent effort put forth.

I won't go into all the special features included with this release, as the Amazon website details them well enough, but I feel I should warn people there are a number of different releases available for this film, primarily fullscreen and widescreen, and the Amazon website doesn't do that great of a job differentiating the two for the causal buyer.  If you really look, you can determine which version is the widescreen, but the fullscreen version isn't as clearly defined.  I've listed as much as I know below...

I went back to the theater about a week later to discover this movie had vanished overnight! I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD, and when I did I bought it because I wanted so see it so bad. I love all the other Romero flicks.

I should have looked at the back of the DVD case before I bought it. When I saw John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper in the film, I knew it was gonna suck. And suck it did.

First of all, he made one zombie all smart. Smart enough to show other zombies how to break down fences and use guns. That really pi$$ed me off. Not only that, but at the end of the film there is a horde of zombies running around on a bridge that they could have easily killed, with no risk to thier own lives.  They didn't kill them. Instead the hero said, ""Dont. They are just looking for a place to go. Just like us.""

SINCE WHEN DO HUMANS SHOW COMPASSION FOR FLESH-EATING ZOMBIES?!?!?!?!?!

I will never watch this movie again, and it is sitting on my dvd shelf as a reminder of the time and money I wasted on this horrible horrible movie.  If you want a real zombie movie, pick Night of the Living Dead, or Dawn of the Dead.

Final Review 8==================> -100,000 Sympathetic Zombie Loving Humans",1131840000,11,1331,4.151750972762646
1553398,4,B00005JO16,"The first time I ever laid eyes on George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead was actually from a local television broadcast of Halloween II back when I was in grade school. At that impressionable age, the small snippet of Romero's masterpiece creeped me out more than the actual movie it was stuffed into. From that point until the time I actually became brave enough to watch Night Of The Living Dead on my own, I ran across it several times on late night television. For a good while in my formative years, the movie was like kryptonite to me.....until I actually watched it in it's entirety. I can't remember at what age I actually watched Night Of The Living Dead from start to finish but I knew that at the point, I'd never seen anything like it in terms of unflinching gore and violence. I wasn't aware that movies could be that way. Nowadays, I consider myself to be somewhat of an amateur pseudo-film buff in that I own a lot of movies. A lot. But, no matter how many I ever consume, I can and will always find room somewhere in my collection for a movie from George A. Romero's Dead collection.

These days, the schlock being passed off as ""horror"" has the frightening capabilities of watching Ben Affleck eat pancakes in a bunny costume. Sure, it's unsettling in a way but overall, too laughable to be considered effective. As each new horror DVD release hits store shelves, it's obvious that the movie creators are trying their damndest to make the cover artwork have the lasting impression that cover art from films like Night Of The Living Dead, The Exorcist or Evil Dead but are falling way short of the mark. So, by today's horror standards, the cover artwork for George Romero's latest zombie romp is pretty effective but when compared to the dire looking artwork splashed across the first trio of Dead films, Land Of The Dead is pretty tame....severed hand and all.

Ohhh....how I wish this movie had either been shot in black & white or with an old 16mm reel. Even with today's technological breakthrough's in the film industry that could have been utilized to create a mock film grain filter to give it that pseudo-documentary feel, George Romero opted for using today's standard equipment with a hint of CGI. Now, before any fans get upset at the thought of CGI, I can assure that all but one quick scene looks as un-CGI as possible. The bulk of the zombie gore is done with human actors, prosthetics and mechanical models featuring exploding parts and blood. I just tend to think that the brightness and brilliance of most movies today is too easy on the eyes to give a zombie movie that atmosphere of bleakness. In a weird way, it reminds me of the crappy 1998 Godzilla abomination. On the plus side, the zombie effects are still pretty interesting/gory/disturbing as one might expect from George Romero. The best example of this is the one inside the military weapons complex where Riley and some soldier enters and hears moaning in the darkness. As the turn on their flashlights, they are greeted with a zombie feast in the darkest corner of the storage area where absolutely nothing is held back as the undead gorge themselves on human organs and flesh in a most unflinching manner. This scene is an effective scene as it is kind of a throwback to Dawn Of The Dead in the basement of the housing complex or Lucio Fulci's Zombie where those unlucky stumble upon a group of zombies eating the homeowners intestines in the most gruesome of ways. Though it's not as prevalent as I might have preferred, the gore is plentiful when it's thrown in your face.

Anyone who has ever seen a George Romero movie knows that no matter who gets top billing, the zombies are the main attraction. So, in the respect, it actually helps when the characters that provide the dialogue are annoying or unlikable. It gives the viewer the hope of seeing the characters get whomped. Fortunately, I cannot think of one redeeming character in this movie. It's not even each individual character's motives that make me want to see them get wrecked. It's also a matter of the choice of actor in some cases. For instance, Simon Baker plays Riley who is really as bland, boring and unlikable as one can imagine. John Leguizamo, who is hit or miss to the point where you just like him enough to not wish him any specific harm, portrays Cholo who is your stereotypical opportunist and is generally one-dimensional. Even Dennis Hopper who is a pretty celebrated screen legend plays the antagonistic corporate shill in Kauffman. While it might seem like that this lack of dimension would play to the movie's strengths, it really doesn't. The characters are basically forgettable and even aggravating to look at to the point where their unworthiness of being in a George Romero film is maddening. What makes it worse is that many of these name actors make it through the film to see the other side. The other thing about these characters that kind of gets on my nerves is their obvious general references from a political standpoint. It's been pretty well known since before this movie came out that Land Of The Dead was a political commentary on life in America under the Bush Administration. While I see no problem in this, the obvious is so overstated that it detracts from what should be the movie's most enjoyable aspects. Kauffman is the evil capitalist sitting atop his ivory tower known as Fiddler's Green while the other name actors represent the direction-less middle class fighting to survive and the zombies represent the poverty stricken masses and the barrier around the city is to represent the stark division between the haves and the have-nots. While it's a clever concept on the surface, some of the dialogue (such as Riley's constant badgering about moving to Canada) is so loaded with political and social jargon that it strips away the layers of entertainment-laden gore that older Romero films are chock full of. Still, watching the zombie masses rise up and go on a full blown blood feast of the corporate elite and their pompous families inside of Fiddler's Green is worth the price of admission alone.

The Bottom Line: Land Of The Dead, despite it's occasionally lame moments of overtly political commentary, is still miles ahead of the Hollywood horror pack. The atmosphere isn't really there anymore and the overall sense of dread and enclosure is long since tossed out the window. What made the original Dead trilogy so amazing and unique where the feelings of entrapment within a confined space with no sense of escape. In Land Of The Dead, the entrapment is still there but on a much larger, wide open scale with the sense that there is a safe haven out there. If you are looking for a prototypical George Romero frightfest, you might be better off starting at the beginning and working your way to Land Of The Dead.",1131667200,4,6835,4.712374581939799

The plot was so predictable, & I felt George gave to much ""Life"" to the zombies...Cmon, zombies cant think! Anyway, I bought it because I own just about every zombie movie made, but I don't think I'll be popping it in the DVD player anytome soon.",1131667200,5,461,4.076923076923077
1553400,2,B00005JO16,"Look folks, let's tell it like it is:

George Romero - to a large degree - invented the modern ""zombie"" film. Sure, in the 1930's there was ""The Island of Lost Souls,"" but it wasn't until Romero came out with Night of the Living Dead that zombies became hip or cool. Prior to that they were just dead folks wandering aimlessly around. Romero gave them street cred by having them eat human flesh. Gross!

Anyway, his first film's critical and box office success was something of a surprise for even him. It's not a great film, but it does speak to people on different levels (frankly, I'm of the mind that he wasn't really doing the whole alegory thing - it just happens to sound much more intelligent that way).

Anyway, we'll say that film ranks a 4 star treatment because it set the bar, but it had dismal acting and a very cheapo feel to it.

Then we've got ""Dawn of the Dead,"" which is arguably the best of all of the ""Dead"" movies (among other zombie movies, it gets 5 stars). It actually does speak to consumerism in America and it also really kicked off the modern ""gore"" film. Up until that point there really wasn't much of a need for a new breed of special make up effects artists. Romero got a guy named Tom Savini to do the make-up. It caused more than one theater to turn into a vomitorium - and Savini became the go-to guy for gory effects.

Then there's Day of the Dead....This film really isn't much good on any level, because it seems that Romero didn't really know where to go with the who mythos. It didn't speak much to anything other than furtherance of the franchise...

Now we have Land of the Dead...It has, hands down, the best acting cred of any of the films, with Simon Baker and Dennis Hopper along for the ride. The gore effects are truly disgusting (but Savini still can't make the skin being pulled away from a body look real - it still looks like rubber (latex) skin - it snaps!). The premise is interesting, in that we have a group of people living in a modern utopia since the dead have largely taken over the planet. This one particular utopia was apparently thought up and implemented by Dennis Hopper's character. He's corrupt of course. Simon Baker is apparently the Robin Hood of the piece and his intent is to help the people but ultimately he wants to pull a Garbo.

Part Mad Max: The Thunderdome and part Blade Runner and part...well part...zombie film, Land of the Dead just doesn't stand up against the films before it.

It is a meal, but it's not really satisfying (no pun intended).

The acting is good and story is secondary to the gore and the zombies themselves. The idea that the dead are beginning to create their own civilization isn't really fully fleshed out. One zombie was apparently a gas station attendant (do they still have those?) and he's the rocket scientist among the zombies. He leads a throng of these walking dead to this utopian city. However, he must have something on his dead mind, because whereas in previous films the zombies were only interested in eating, most here seem intent on getting into the city and pass by many a meal.

There's also a whole corruption/crushing the little people idea that is just lightly addressed (the ""trash"" we see Leguizamo disposing of in the beginning isn't zombie trash, but rather the corpses of murdered living citizens).

Romero puts a lot of ideas out there, but he doesn't fully develop them. I don't know that even if fully developed, they would make the film better than it is. It would just be interesting to see what it would have been if he had.

Basically, this is a script of the quality of Day of the Dead. It gets two stars.

Thanks, George A. Romero!  You've influenced countless others. You have made a better film. It's good to go out on top; now bow out gracefully. Maybe, another title, eight to ten years from now? Really, end it!

""Return of the Living Dead 4""

""Universe of the Dead"" aka ""Zombies In Space""

""I, Zombie""

However, if you are looking for a great gorey flick with non-stop action, you may have found just what you were looking for. I thought the plot was a little weak but the fake gore was nothing below awesome. I was surprised to see Denis Hopper in this among other familiar faces. Compared to most other zombie flicks, this is an extremely cinamatic film. The filming is great. The special features on the DVD are great. My favorite was the making of the gore. They show you the studios where they put together the fake body parts and stuff. It's all really good gross-out stuff.

1553468,1,B00005JO16,"As a fan of the zombie genre, this movie had a unique opportunity to deal with not the day in which the world changes, but rather, the aftermath. And instead of giving us a film with such rich dialogue and moments such as Charlton Heston in ""The Omega Man"" or the Dawn of the Dead remake, or even ""Shaun of the Dead"" this movie is a c-grade zombie movie with none of the redeeming qualities one has come to expect from the low-budget genre. I'd recommend any uninitiated person to peruse John Carpenter, the king of low-budget horror, or even other zombie movies that are far superior.

Land of the Dead has a lot of props and an obvious larger budget than any of its predecessors, but fails to deliver on several points: the dialogue is completely flat. as some have noted in other reviews, this version just completely lacks any depth to its characters. The lead is so unmemorable that one can, at times, mistake him for the blank slate that is Matthew McConaughey. None of the characters shine, least of all a canned performance by Dennis Hopper. John Leguizamo's character is next to worthless, and the only character one finds entertaining is a truck- the Dead Reckoning. The characters in this movie also act unnaturally, and the ""vices"" of the city are too much distraction and really not adding anything to the overall movie. This movie is fraught with many such distractions which add almost nothing to the plot, nor to the zombie genre. It'd be best if this one were forgotten or erased from the development, which has seen steady progress with 28 days later's introduction of fast zombies, Dawn of the Dead 2004's high production quality, and other films have made other contributions.

I've laughed at some because they were bad. I've laughed at some because they were good. But this stinker of a film not only doesn't deserve to be called a zombie film, it doesn't deserve to be called a FILM.

It's basically a cast of paper thin characters wandering through a music video while the good guys are made to look ultra cool and the bad guys ( of course, the rich white guys) are made to look clumsy and stupid. It's Romero desperately trying to fob off a movie on his fans by copying dozens of stereotypes from past summer action films and insulting everyone's intelligence the whole time. The ""intelligence"" displayed by the poorly made-up zombies, nothing which hasn't been shown in other, much better, zombie films, neither adds nor detracts from the film.

1553471,3,B00005JO16,"After watching the film, and reading some reviews, here's a few things I've noticed:

a)  Didn't this remind anyone of ""Conquest of the Planet of the Apes""?  Where the Apes got smarter, led by their leader, and eventually took over the city ruled by humans?  Difference was, I actually rooted for the apes to win.  Here, I could care less for the humans or zombies.
b)  If NIGHT was a classic(it is), and DAWN was a great stand-alone sequel(it was), and DAY was considered a disappointing yet somewhat satisfying/natural conclusion to the series...how can fans of the series give LAND 5 stars?  They're saying it's as good as NIGHT/DAWN?  I don't think so.  3, maybe 3.5 stars, is generous.
c)  Some Romero fans defend the film by citing its important political themes(class struggles, parables with 9/11, Bush-era terrorist paranoia);  while others defend it by saying 'relax it's just a horror flick, put your brain on hold and just enjoy the ride"".  So which is it?  Or maybe it's just not that great of a movie, compared to the first 3 anyway.
d)  'But wait!', you say.  'You're being unfair comparing it to NIGHT/DAWN/DAY or classics of other genres.'  Ok, so if you compare it with just other horror/zombie films it's still 5-stars?  Sorry, but this horror film suffers from other horror film problems:  too action-oriented(and not even exciting action at that) and not enough genuine scares, chills, thrills, atmosphere, etc.
e)  Also, notice how Romero fans are outraged at other films that have zombies using weapons, going fast, getting smarter, thinking...yet it happens in LAND, and some fans either readily accept it, or think it's a stroke of genius.  It's not a bad idea really, but that concept was already used(and better executed) in DAY OF THE DEAD wasn't it?
f)  The cast seemed flat and uninspired to me with little rooting interest(as opposed to the previous non-flashy yet somewhat fleshed out characters you cared about in the previous films).  Leguizamo probably had the best, or most 3-dimensional, character.  Perhaps focusing in on him as the anti-hero would've been more compelling and daring.
g)  The zombies did look good though(although I would've liked a few to look more rotted like in the Fulci zombie films), and the gore and blood were really good.  There were some nice, gruesome scenes that seem to be inspired by DAY OF THE DEAD.  No question, this film has a good(non cgi) gross-out factor, which is its best asset.

Overall, I really do think this is a notch below the previous 3 in terms of ambition and execution.  Outside of the gore/zombie factor, the film just seemed too pedestrian, like an action/adventure zombie film with no real gripping characters or story.  This doesn't really make it a bad movie, it just means it'll have to take a back seat to the previous films.  IMHO= NIGHT=5, DAWN=5, DAY=4, LAND=3.  The dvd edition is high quality, with plenty of extras.  But like another reviewer said, one smells a ""special collector's edition"" coming along sooner or later.  To horror genre fans in general:

1553472,1,B00005JO16,"George A. Romero is a name synonymous with the zombie genre. NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and its sequel, DAWN OF THE DEAD are two all-time horror classics. That is why it is such a shame and disppointment he sacrificed this movie, the fourth and supposedly final installment in his Dead cycle, in order to make silly socio-political commentary.

LAND OF THE DEAD has so much wrong with it I don't know where to begin. A movie in which zombies have the capabilty to think, organize and utilize tools and weaponry is as bad --if not worse-- as the recent DAWN OF THE DEAD remake in which zombies run about with speed and agility. While it is true that writers Mark E. Rogers (THE DEAD) and Brian Keene (THE RISING, CITY OF THE DEAD) have had success with the concept of intelligent zombies; however, the ghouls of their novels are mere vessels, possessed by demonic spirits (a concept which was ever so slightly hinted at in the aforementioned DAWN OF THE DEAD remake). Romero, on the other hand, doesn't allow demonic or any otherwise preternatural explanations for his zombies' origins. All we know is that soon after the return of a space probe in 1969, the recently deceased began coming back to life (see NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). Only the brain's ""reptilian core,"" the part which makes us move and eat is reactivted. Since the more complex, cerebral part rapidly decays at the point of death, the Romero zombie is forever incapable of being anything more than a walking eating machine. Taking this futher through its course, regardless that the rate of decomposition has slowed down, since the undead receive no real nourishment from their cannibalistic cravings and since they are under constant exposure to sun, heat and the elements, no zombie would still be walking after 20 years. Contrary to what some reviewers here believe, horror writers and filmmakers cannot simply ""do whatever they want to do"" with the subject matter or genre they work in. Like the vampire or like the werewolf, the zombie has become a horror institution. As vampire enthusiasts overwhelmingly resist the idea of those bloodsuckers roaming about in the daylight, zombie fans expect their particular monster to be slow but ominous, individually weak but deadly in numbers. Few of us get our fright rocks off watching a calculating, plotting corpse.

Regardless whether the zombies act intelligently or not, this movie fails through bad direction, horrible plot and script and an almost total disregard for detail. In Romero's world, ordered society supposedly fell apart circa mid-1970s. Yet in LAND OF THE DEAD we see cash still being used. Add to this absurdity a scene in which a teenager is left alone in the middle of the night in some isolated spot to collect some of that cash; meanwhile, while waiting for the drop, he plays video games and has headphones blasting in his ears. You can see we have one cheesy production here.

Two things though render this movie not just bad but insulting:

In his previous Dead films Romero always had a black man as the hero. Here, not only is the leader of the zombies, ""Big Daddy,"" a black corpse; but the only living black character is a stepinfetchit butler stereotype. In his zeal to attack all things he perceives Republican, Romero resorts to insulting every African-American viewer and fan out there.

The other insult is directed at anyone with common sense and pertains to those scenes where crowds of people are supposed to be overrun by zombies. The extras used in these shots are terrible. Clearly they look more amused than terrified, fleeing for their lives. In fact some of them seem to be trying not to burst out with laughter from all the fun they are having playing at being chased by zombies! Shoppers and diners inside the tower seem unaware to the very loud and chaotic fact that just one floor below them zombie hordes have crashed through and are coming up the escalators!

Poorly conceived, sloppily directed, wasted quality actors (Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo) and dripping with contempt for its own genre and fans, LAND OF THE DEAD is a tacky failure and Romero should be ashamed of himself for making this garbage. Perhaps someday he will come to his senses and make one more Dead flick truly deserving of his name and legacy.",1130716800,31,4281,4.809782608695652
1553522,4,B00005JO16,"With the reborn interest in zombie films (thanks to 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead, and Dawn of the Dead remake) it was only natural for Romero to retake the throne and give us another installment in his Dead series. After seeing this in the theatre in July and then watching it for the first time on DVD, I have to admit the ""Unrated/Uncut"" version did not seem to be all that different. It's very gory, but so was the theatrical version. That said, the extras on this disc are pretty sweet, particularly the mini-documentary of the Shaun of the Dead guys meeting Romero and playing zombies in the film, the commentary track isn't all that bad either.

If you're a zombie fan, then you already own Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead. And there is probably no way you would want to leave your series incomplete.

The cast was very good. The only one I felt wasn't any good was the guy who played Kaufman. Other than that I felt the cast was well rounded.

Mainly in the movie Simon is trying to get the truck back from his second in command and when he does get it back it's time to save the city from the ""stenches"" or as I call them zombies. It's basically the same as the other Dead movies near the end which made it boring. Although I say watch it if your a big diehard fan of gore, violence, and zombie movies because you'll love it.

He opted to tell a story, and have a message or moral about humanity he was trying to convey with the movie.  instead of going straight to the horror like a lot of these movies do, dragging along from one kill to the next, but it seemed that the zombies got into the city and created chaos way to easily.  It was like he just ran out of ideas and chose to show as much gore as possible, while it was still fun to watch in a cheesy horror film sort of way it didn't mesh with the first two acts.  The film fell short of it's goal of not being another mindless gorefest and in fact became just that.  and as I was watching gruesome death being dealt to citizen after citizen I couldn't stop thinking about how this didn't seem plausible with how the movie had been going.  yes I know it's a zombie movie, but it had set you up for a great battle between man and zombies and gave you only a slaughter.

there are a few spots where the cgi takes away from the film but other than that its great.

the actors in the film did an awesome job some good laughs and great special effects dealing with the zombies.

i rate a 5 star movie i am a big fan of romero as well as just ordered the pc game land of the dead road to fiddlers green for the pc.

if you like resident evil movies then here is another great zombie flick to wet your appetite.

as well as got the kick out of the social theme from the movie which was cool.

the only con is that there are some spots that the cgi just didn't fit in wish they wouldve stuck to regular special effects wouldve been alot smoother and it wouldnt take you away from the story.

if your a zombie fan then ad this to you dvd library it is a must have.

as i stated above here are some other films people might be interested in if they enjoyed land of the dead and the movie are as follows:dawn of the dead, resident evil 1 and 2, shawn of the dead, as well as romero other flicks that are in this series.

You see something happen and you know it was done with computers and it sorta takes you away from the movie for a few seconds, which prevents you from being really ""into"" the movie.  During the commentary it seems they tried to downplay the use of CGI.  However, it seems like most everything you see is done with CGI. It would have been a lot better if they used live/on-set effects like all of the previous movies.

I did like the social message behind it all (as all his movies do), but I'll let you interpret it for yourself.

The main character, Simon Baker, looks good for the part. He does an okay job. His weird sidekick does an okay job as well, yet his part seems unnecessary. Asia Argento seems to try a little too hard to be a tomboy. John Leguizamo does a good job, and he seems to be the only character I cared about by the end. Dennis Hopper does a great job.

The script is about all these people living on an island. They try to coexist, yet unfortunately some social unrest makes every angry. John Leguizamo decides to take action, and the rest is the plot of the movie. The weird thing about the script is the fact that the zombies now have the ability to do much more than before. One of the zombies develops the mental capacity to work a gun, much like Bub did in Day of the Dead. That same zombie has the power to lead the people into the city. Other zombies have the power to hide perfectly, and then jump out unexpectedly. You would think that the zombie would just strike when he sees the person, but for some reason they wait.

I wouldn't say the movie is great, but it definetly has some fun parts. The violence is brutal in the uncut version. It is by far the most brutal yet. People's corpses get mangled into pieces, and it happens often. If you can handle it, it's good.",1130371200,3,1437,4.221818181818182

it doesn't leave anything good, Romero once said that he  didn't make zombie movies just for the  monters,no he wanted to make some  movie aboutsome  people trap in situations , and who they respond to that situations( and the zombies were the situations) .

well , land of the dead its just a zombie movie and a very bad,(whach out spoilers) what's up whith the zombie that alway scream when a zombie die , or at the end when one of the survivors  see a buch of zombies ( the ones that killed alot of his friends) a his prepare to shot them down and the principal male character stop him and gave him a look like ""hey they have feelings to"" and the he looks the head zombie and give him another look like "" i undertand "" and the zombie gives him  a aproval look!!!!!!!!!!!!! , what ist that , this are zombies they are disgusting . imagine  bambi but just the small diference that bambi and all the animals are zombies and where are suppose to cry when some one of them dieds?, again!!!! what a nonsense.

this movie is no way close to the other zombie movies , well  thats all.",1130284800,7,1729,4.1878787878787875
1553588,5,B00005JO16,"I have been a huge Romero fan since my early teens (growing up in Pittsburgh!)  I have seen all of his films and I love all of his early indie stuff.  Once George A. Romero ""hit the big time"" with proper studio backing, his work began to suffer, starting with the disappointing MONKEY SHINES.  But I can watch the brilliant early Romero flicks over and over again, especially MARTIN, KNIGHTRIDERS, the first three LIVING DEAD films, and CREEPSHOW.  I even love his drastically more under-funded and less critically/financially successful movies, THERE'S ALWAYS VANILLA, SEASON OF THE WITCH, and THE CRAZIES.

After more than a decade of getting jerked around by brainless studio executives, Romero finally returned with BRUISER.  This film kinda rides the fence between independent and studio-financed.  I don't know if Romero was just rusty from years of enduring studio abuse instead of actually making movies... or if there were serious budgetary restraints in action there... but BRUISER was not the great return to filmmaking I had hoped for from George.  The movie was extremely well-made and the acting was terrific... but the film seemed somewhat bland and timid to me.

A few years later my horror-fan-boy dream came true... it was officially announced that Romero was in production on his fourth DEAD movie.  Bad news, it was being made with studio financing... Good news, it would be the biggest budget Romero has ever been given to make a movie.

I went to see LAND OF THE DEAD with high hopes... and I was NOT let down at all this time.  LAND OF THE DEAD is possibly George A. Romero's best film ever, and it is also one of the best horror movies I have ever seen.  I truly appreciate Universal Studios providing a decent budget (for a zombie film) and supporting Romero instead of tying his hands.

LAND OF THE DEAD works on all levels.  The story is unique and fascinating.  The characters are multi-layered and believable.  The actors playing them are outstanding.  The brilliant cinematography and production design make this the atmospheric and spooky horror show we've all been aching to see.  The gore is absolutely top-notch.  And, as usual, Romero keeps a bed of intelligent social commentary smoldering below the surface throughout.  This is a great movie.

The uncut, unrated version on this DVD is even BETTER than the theatrical version.  The bonus features on the DVD are awesome, presenting us with our first real look at Romero in action since DOCUMENT OF THE DEAD.  (Be sure to check out the featurette called ""When Shaun Met George""  ...you'll love it!)

I highly recommend the uncut DVD of this amazing horror film.  And THANK YOU, George, for making this movie - and proving that you are indeed the Master Of Horror.",1130284800,,2749,4.868534482758621

1553646,3,B00005JO16,"As a horror/zombie film fan, I was really looking forward to this latest installment from the legendary film-maker...Unfortunately, I feel disappointed after my first viewing.  This film adds nothing to Romero's zombie trilogy or to the zombie film genre.  Zombies that can think...big deal!  How about writing a good plot and casting some decent actors.  Where was the suspense?  *SPOILER ALERT*  All of the ""good"" main characters survive and drive off into the sunset?  Give me a break!  I think it's time for Romero to move on.  Let other directors re-interpret the zombie genre--some have done a better job.  If you want an entertaining zombie flick, it's tough to beat Dead Alive or Cemetary Man.  If you want a scary one, I'd recommend the first 10 minutes of the Dawn of the Dead remake or Dead Meat.  Romero has become one of the walking dead--it's time to put him down...RIP",1130198400,2,883,4.8133333333333335

1553648,4,B00005JO16,"I am a huge fan of George Romero and the Zombie genre.  People think I am out there because of my passion. The movie was great,  but here is what I do not understand. Land of the dead is the 4th installment of the the dead movies. In which case Food should have run out sometime in Dawn of the dead. Life as we knew seized.  When did Pepsi have time to make and deliver cases of soda or food for that matter. Time should have frozen. The world should have been trapped in the late sixties, possibly early seventies.  Progress should not exist.  people are trying to survive so it only make sense that food, clothing and electric companies stopped productions.  Do not get me started on the modern music paying at the bar.  I mean the world as we knew it is basically over yet some hip hop artist manages to cut an album???? Cell phones were invented? I mean in a span of 37 years gas should have run out since no more deliveries were being made to the gas pumps. Did anyone notice the Burberry bag with the cash? Let's be real...designers are still coming out with their spring line just in time for the end of the world. In closing the end of the world is just that the END! there should have not been any progression whatsoever.  Do not misunderstand me.  The movie was well worth it, with the exception of BIG DADDY he just worked my last nerve. George's vision was awesome. But if the world as we knew it did not exist anymore it only make sense that we would be going hungry, living in the dark and listening to oldies but goodies.",1130112000,6,1536,4.25085910652921
1553649,5,B00005JO16,"Land of the Dead is the first in a proposed new Zombie trilogy from the man who started it all, George Romero.  The very first thing that is evident in this film that is different than Romero's first three ""dead"" films is the budget.  The success of films like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake made this film bankable to Hollywood execs and certainly gave Romero far more to work with than he ever has before.  Better special effects, better make-up, superior acting.  Some are criticizing the film for a lack of a storyline but it's no different than any of the other dead films...it's human's against zombies.

Land is sort of Dawn of the Dead remade and expanded.  Instead of a handful of humans being trapped in a mall, there are now thousands trapped in a city.  Only they don't think of themselves as trapped and life goes on as the city is protected by electified fences, walls, and rivers.  Social commentary has always been a big part of the Dead films and Land is no different.  The wealthy are still the ""haves"" and live in the prestigious Fiddler's Green Tower filled with luxury apartments, shopping, and hotels.  It's run by Kaufman played by Dennis Hopper.  If there is a story complaint it's that there's no backstory to the characters.  Just who is kaufman?  Why is he in charge of Fiddler's Green?  Is he a Donald Trump?  A former Mayor?  This is left without explanation.

So even in this post-apocalyptic world overrun by Zombies, there is still a very tangible class system.  Those not wealthy or socially acceptable enough to live in the tower must make do on the streets.  Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo) are a couple of hired bandits for lack of a better word.  Rily has built a massive battleship on wheels called Dead Reckoning which they use to venture out of the city into the heart of zombie land to acquire food and other supplies.  Both men have their own plans of what they want to do with their lives.

This sets up a bit of an out of place side story where Cholo steals DEad Reckoning and threatens to blow up the tower and Riley has to get the vehicle back.  Meanwhile...the zombies which began to start learning how to reason in Day of the Dead have advanced led by a black gas station attendant named Big Daddy who eventually leads the zombies to the city.  Someone commented that it was stupid for Kaufman to try and get out of the city with loads of money since the entire social and economic system has broken down.  But that's entirely the point of Romero's satire...even when money no longer matters, people still die or kill for it.

This was a far more gruesome film than the Dawn Remake.  Heads explode, bodie parts are torn off, and guts are yanked out with regular frequency.  The makeup is vastly superior to the Dawn remake where the zomibies moved too fast to get a good look at them and the original Dawn where all the zombies looked powder blue.  And thank you George for not making your zombies run fast!

Land continues to progress the story started in the original film as each successive film shows the zombies more and more in control of the world.  This is our first glimpse at the big picture and we wind out that the plague was world-wide in scope.

The DVD is loaded with excellent special features and the film had a cameo by Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright which is captured in one of the featurettes.  So maybe Land of the Dead wasn't the deepest story...it's a great Zombie film and who needs much more than that?",1130112000,2,3522,4.478806907378336
1553650,4,B00005JO16,"Here's the problem. Romero allows a remake of Dawn last year that takes the zombies to a new level: they run, they seem a little smarter, and (yuck) they can give birth. Then this year, in Land, the zombies seem to have forgotten how to run but now they are even smarter than in the Dawn remake. Oh well. Land was still good fun.

I thought that the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead was terrific, as was last year's Dawn of the Dead remake. Land was fun, but it was a step away from the realistic situations predominant in the more recent versions of Night Of and Dawn. (Wait a minute...realistic situations...the walking dead...???)

Anyway, Land of the Dead is certainly not a continuation of last year's Dawn. It's George Romero's take on what happens to some far-fetched Dennis Hopper owned ""city"" well after the zombies have taken over the rest of the world. John Leguizamo and Simon Baker are two mercenaries that run a gang of zombie killers with access to an awesome battle machine and a ton of firepower (these two guys and their gangs running the ""military"" of the city as opposed to the city police/military running it themselves make you need to go even further for that extra grain of salt).

A ""smart"" zombie leads an angry mob of other zombies to Dennis' city, John Leguizamo turns on Dennis and Simon finds some good guys to try to make it all right in a world gone bad.

I was entertained and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on Land of the Dead. And beware...what George seemed to lack in a more believable plot line he made up for in going for the gross out.",1130112000,2,1605,4.448979591836735

1553653,1,B00005JO16,"I'll try not to be long-winded so here goes....
This DVD is NOT worth owning. It's filled with cliches, short on action, gore, and plot, and long on trying to be ""cool"". Especially when it comes to the nicknames....sheesh! Even the directors comments are lame. I really liked Romero's previous ""Dead"" efforts and felt last years ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake was worthwhile though a bit short on gore ( compared to the original and especially 'Day of the Dead, ha,ha ). This flick almost made me mad it was so weak. The deal is this: The Dead are up and eating folk. When you die you'll become one and getting bitten by one will cause this to happen quicker. Only by piercing the brain can you stop them from moving..sever the head and the eyes will keep 'looking' and the mouth will still try and bite, btw. Anyway ""Land Of The Dead"" is years after this first happened and the world is overrun. There is a fortfied ( island or penisula ) city mostly protected by an electrified fence with a high rise in the middle occupied by the rich. As usual the poor are kept away and distracted from the awful conditions by various vices. A team of folk go out on missions every now and then to bring supplies back. They go at night in a big tank like truck with machine guns and rocket launchers and a fireworks display ( to distract the 'stenchies' as the zombies are called). So two of the main guys who head the teams want to change their status. One wants into the restricted high rise and the other wants to get away from everybody. Also one of the stenchies, called Big Daddy has developed the power to learn and after an aborted mission into his town begins to lead the rest of the zombies toward the city. For reasons unknown and unspecified. Its hinted ( in directors comments especially) he's angered because humans mistreat the undead. Uh, yeah! BTW, everytime the zombies stop to eat their victims he bellows/roars and they (sometimes and not all of them) stop munching and continue on their 'mission'. The ending doesn't make clear exactly what motivates the zombies, and during the director comments Romero makes it clear this is not a sequel. The story gets going after Mr. Big (Dennis  Hopper as the main Rich Guy) lets the ambitious mission leader know he can't buy his way into the high rise--so the guy steals the fortfied truck/tank at the same moment the stenchies have arrived and bogarded their way into the city. The other mission leader is called upon to retrieve said tank/truck and blah,blah,blah.  I didn't realize one human character was supposed to be retarded until another character pointed it out, and why make the guy retarded in the first place? Another character agrees to be left ALONE on a pier for two hours with only a handgun, skateboard, and a rifle (I think he had a rifle) and some reefer in a world overrun with flesh eating walking corpses!? Granted the whole premise is unbelievable but thats just ridiculous.....guess what happens to him. Another scene involves two guys in a dark warehouse filled with zombies and they flash their lights around yet they don't get attacked. BTW what happened to the kid INSIDE the compound who was bitten by a zombie? 'Pillsbury' (a human character sent to help retrieve the tank/truck and supposedly a B-I-I-I-I-G BAAAAD motherscorcher)  was barely bigger than the female lead!
One scene has two (clothed!) women soul kissing and then they are attacked by stenchies/zombies. They're doing this in a booth while all around them alarms are going off, people are running and screaming, fires are being set etc. and absolutely NO passion is evident during the kiss, why is this scene even there...
I wasted my money on this one.
If you must watch it, BORROW IT.
Not a complete waste of time but I think that a three dollar rental is a big rip (off).
Its not exceedingly bad, but it is absurd and pointless.
Even the sfx are pedestrian.
""Day of the Dead"" was better in every way.

1553722,2,B00005JO16,"Naturally, anyone would feel guilty about hating this movie. And I didn't hate it until about 3/4 of the way through. A lot of it was cheesy, but I appreciate good cheese. The thing that got on my nerves was the underlying social commentary, which is, as I take it, some weird liberal agenda to show us that blacks and hispanics are going to rise up? Or it's about the poor? I don't think you average joe can figure out what the hell Romero was trying to say here. Either you say something boldy, or don't say it all. All the shots taking at Mexicans in this movie don't really apply to the overall theme, so one is left wondering why they are included. Anyway... without all the social stuff, I would have liked this movie. It's not the best zombie movie. At best, it's a low-grade sci-fi channel movie. If you think you can get past the misdirected politics of it, and some of the really horrible acting (However, the blonde-haired captain guy's acting was superb), maybe you'll like it. To the averge viewer, it comes across as a bunch of zombie movie people coming together for one last hurrah, bit it doesn't really make any noise for the rest of us.",1130025600,,1155,4.427230046948357

1553724,3,B00005JO16,"Land of the Dead reminds me of everybody who's doing something only maybe not the most efficient way, then here comes this other guy and he goes ""oh, you want to do this?"" and does it perfectly. Well maybe not perfect but this film looks at films like the Resident Evil's, 28 Days Later, and the Dawn of the Dead remake and goes ""step back and learn"". So we have this film which may not be the most family fun, but rent with a few buddies and you'll have a good time, nothing more.

I haven't watched the previous 3 so I can't comment on those. But in this one, many humans now live in cities with water on all sides and electrified fences all around. A team gets sent to get supplies now and then(why they don't just take them all at once is beyond me). Only something peculiar happens: one of the zombies, nicknamed Big Daddy can actually think, well sort of. It's more like a case of deductive reasoning and nothing more. He sees something and learns what it is, he goes ""ooh, I see"" and off we go.

Part of the team is a man named Cholo, working for another man, THE man in the city. Only Cholo's not getting paid so for revenge he decides to hold the whole city for ransom or he'll fire missiles from a big truck known as Dead Reckoning. Sent by the man to get him is Riley, pretty much the designer of the truck. So it's basically a race to get the truck then turn around to save the city.

If there's one thing you can count on in a zombie movie is gore and with this unrated edition, it's got it in spades. Faces' get pulled; tongues, arms and heads get ripped out; even a belly-button ring gets yanked out. If you're not into gore or can't stomach, stay away from this. There's a big gap where the ""story"" takes over but once zombies hit the city it's pretty much carnage right through.

Personally, I'm not into horror films. Quite frankly, a lot of them are stupid and trying to do something which they're not doing in the end. Gore is meant to create disgust, a sense of ""eww, did that head just get pulled off?"" but what it's supposed to do is freak you the **** out. That's me so other people might find that freaky but me personally I like it when a horror film gets under my skin and creeps me out. Of course with a film like this, it's supposed to be carnage candy so you just go along with it.

If you're big on horror, gore, or just the zombie films in general, you'll dig this. If you're like me who's into films like Seven or Aliens where the gore is more implied rather than shown in all it's glory well stay clear.",1129939200,3,2537,4.169387755102041
1553725,4,B00005JO16,"That's right.  This film, which in most respects is a very normal (but still very entertaining) zombie film, has one unique twist.  It makes the zombies sympathetic.  Even more impressive, it does so while keeping them flesh-hungry, merciless eating machines.

The screenplay does an excellent job of giving these zombies souls.  That's about the best word for it.  Particularly the leader of these walking dead, who I could really empathize with.  And I'm not dead and I'm a vegetarian, so go figure.  By the end of the film, while I didn't want the zombies to eat everyone, I did find myself rooting at least a little bit for the zombies, and that's a pretty neat trick.

As for the human cast, they're all treated with sympathy and depth, even the unpleasant ones.  Except for Dennis Hopper's character who is pretty much an elitist, money-grubbing jerk who gets his just rewards.

Very fun and very thoughtful film.  Just goes to show that you don't have to completely reinvent the walking dead to have a solid zombie film.",1129939200,,1027,4.7727272727272725
1553726,4,B00005JO16,"It seems that the fourth entry in George Romero's much loved series of zombie films has had such a highly mixed reaction to it, people don`t know what to think of it. First of all, I think it is unfair to George Romero, who is one of my favorite filmmakers, to get such a mixed reaction to Land of the Dead because it is a great film. He has a gift for giving us great horror films and those with a more critical eye can see that his films are not just thrill-a-minute horror, they have a certain intelligence and unique style all their own. Night of the living Dead was the first in this series. It is beautifully shot in black and white, has some hideous gore, some great performances, and wonderful suspense that made it a cult classic horror film that most critics believe was a response to the brutality of the Vietnam war. Next came Dawn of the Dead. It also became a much loved cult film and is the most popular of the series. It is like a gory, metaphorically rich comic book that seems to be the most ambitious of the series, and it had a social commentary on consumerism. Day of the Dead came next, and I think what is happening with Land of the Dead happened here. When it was first released it was met with wide-scale disappointment; people expected it to be another Night or Dawn, but it isn't. It stands on its own as a film that shows a society falling apart while the ever increasing problem becomes impossible to deal with. Land of the Dead seems to have been met with the same expectation and disappointment that I think it does not deserve. Each entry in the series say something different and is presented differently, Land is no exception. It is an ambitious, bleak, and of course, gory commentary on today's society. It shows corporate/political leaders blocking out or ignoring our problems. It shows an ever increasing gap between the societies. It also shows some great characters, both human and zombie. Simon Baker, Asia Argento, Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo, and Robert Joy give fantastic and believable performances. The cinematography is beautiful, the editing is perfect (and gives us some good scares) and the make up and special effects may be the best in the series. Also, its a lot of fun for those who let themselves stop comparing it to the other films. Finally I would also like to say that the un-rated directors cut on DVD is a cause for celebration. It has a perfect picture and audio quality, and the special features are great especially a making of feature and lots of other goodies!

1553727,2,B00005JO16,"I waited anxiously for this movie. I have always loved Romero's movies. My bookshelf is loaded with the original trilogy, as well as Creepshow, Martin, Monkey Shines, and dozens of horror movies that were either direct or indirect takes on Romero's work. So the 4th movie in the Dead series had me drooling in anticipation. All I can say is George..why did you bother?

The long awaited next chapter is just over 90 minutes long? The characters are flat, the story is thready,at best. Some of the characters were passingly interesting..such as Big Daddy. My question of WHAT CAUSED HIS EVOLVEMENT? was never even addressed. He just ""got smart"".

Dennis Hopper was one of the few bright spots in this dark,in more ways than one, dramatic tragedy. He is just the kind of sleaze=ball that you love to hate. It takes a truly good actor to work with someone as talentless as John Leguizamo and make the scene work. Cholo was such a weasel of a character that at leasr I was hoping he would end up Zombie Chow in the first 10 minutes of the film.

Even buying the EXTENDED version of the film, I was still confused at the end as to just who WERE these characters. Day of the Dead was a disappointment, but compared to Land, Day deserves the academy award.

This is worth a rent for the true Romero fans, just so one can see what happens when a good director gets old and tired. Sorry, George but you should have stopped with Dawn.",1129852800,4,1424,4.486486486486487
1553728,2,B00005JO16,"This movie isn't just absolutely terrible...but it isn't exactly good.  Romero has been severely outdone at his own genre by films like ""28 Days Later"" and the recent ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, and so now he feels like the time is appropriate for his big return to hollywood zombie movies.

Fair is fair.  He practically OWNS the genre, right?

Watching this will remind you of Romero's OTHER films---basically everything AFTER his first three zombie films that fell into obscurity---that place known as ""Crap Bowl Cinema"".  The idea is cool, but the plot that he surrounded that idea with falls to pieces.  And I don't care how many times the zombie thing has been done---you're not going to make it interesting by having zombies that learn to use guns and communicate with one another.

None of the leading characters are likeable---and Dennis Hopper brings his B-Movie curse with him on this one.  (Was ""Waterworld"" the last good film he was in?)

Also, the aforementioned films employed something known as ""Zombie School"" for their extras, which was essentially making their every move into a science, so that the zombies actually look believable.  Romero obviously missed that memo, because right off the bat his zombies are hands out before them, stiff-legged, and moaning.

Yes it's entertaining, but in that ""Jay Leno"" kind of way.",1129766400,5,1339,4.986486486486487
1553729,3,B00005JO16,"As is my tradition with writing movie reviews i have never written a two star or three due to the fact that it is such a median choice that leaves the reader to still wonder whether or not to watch the movie. But Ive chosen to do my first here out of respect to ROMERO (the father of the zombie movie) to whom i owe many a sleepless night to.

One of the major mistakes i made in viewing this movie was going into it not looking for the political commentary about the society we live in (which is a prevalent characteristic in most all of Romero's films). Not to give too much away regarding this movie's commentary, but i believe it was meant to focus on the separation of the class system (but enough of the political mumbo jumbo).

Sad to say, the movie really wasn't that scary, and many points seemed kinda hokey and tacked on (the lead zombie had a tendency to cry out in anger at various points in the movie). The movie had some interesting points, in that you got to see the Romero-evolution of the zombie, in regards to his ability to communicate, think, problem solve, shoot guns, use cleavers, play musical instruments (puhleez!!), and in one point make fire to help destroy a car. Yea, i got to admit being a traditionalist in regards to the Zombie Genre all these things were a tad much for me. The greatest evolution Ive enjoyed in zombies over the past few years started with the zombie's ability to run, found in 28 Days LATER (and later in  Dawn of the Dead (the newer edition). One question i always asked myself (I first asked it, after the end of Dawn of the Dead (the newer edition) was if in the position of being a living person chased by zombies, would i be safe on an island? and could zombies survive under water? If you have ever wondered such an odd question then it will be answered should you watch this movie.

And in all honesty id only advise this movie to one who is a dire hard zombie fan (who loves a taste of gore). For those of you looking for a good movie to watch it is likely you won't want to watch it, the characters aren't likable, you at times want to cheer for the zombies, and at the end there is one of those hokey camp moments where a normal man and a zombie look at each other as if they want to wink and say ""good job buddy,  we just won one"" (ugh).

So all in all i guess the best way i can describe this movie is if you are looking for a interesting look at the conflict between the rich, middle, and lower class wrapped in a horror movie, this flick  might well be worth your time. However, if you are looking for a progressive triumph in this form of horror, go back and pop in Dawn of the Dead (the newer edition) or 28 Days Later. And to Romero, keep it up man your best is still within your grasp.",1129766400,4,2755,4.186792452830189
1553730,1,B00005JO16,"Before I get into Romero's ""Land of the Dead"" let me mention a few things.

When I first heard about the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake directed by Zack Snyder, I was the first one to put it down. I said ""how can anyone remake a classic like that?!? I ended up loving it!! I was ""Dead"" wrong about not giving it a chance. Now don't get me wrong, it isn't better than the original, but in it's own right....it was awesome.

Fast Forward to ""Land of the Dead,"" my most anticipated movie since ""Day of the Dead"" came out in 1985. I thought this would be the ultimate zombie movie. Once again I was ""Dead"" wrong!! This movie sucked!! There were no dynamics, terrible characters, and the whole evolution thing didn't work. There was a zombie leader for crying out loud!! Just silly. I could go on and on, but it will be pointless.

Say I'm crying out to Zack Snyder. Please make more zombie movies!!

How Ironic.",1129766400,4,902,4.319526627218935

1553769,1,B00005JO16,"For someone who basically invented the zombie-genre, George Romero did NOTHING to advance the undead mythos. You can keep the thinly veiled social commentary . . . we get it. None of the characters were remotely interesting and the special effects were nothing new. As a matter of fact, the copious use of CGI really put me off. If this film were to have been made 5 or 10 years ago it would have been amazing. It's not quite fair to compare this to the Dawn remake (a much more dynamic offering) or 28 Days Later (which was technically not even a zombie flick). Using Romeros previous efforts as a unit of measure, Land of the Dead is more of a step backwards than forward.

I really wanted to like this movie more but, after repeated viewing, it just didn't cut the mustard . . . history will not be kind to this film.",1129766400,9,820,4.324675324675325
1553770,4,B00005JO16,"It took 20 years for us Romero fans to finally witness firsthand the long-awaited fourth 'Dead' movie. Romero had been rumored to be considering it for many years, and up until now we had wondered if he would ever make another film. Well wait no longer fans...we now have this fourth entry in the 'Dead' film series, and was it worth the wait? You bet!

LAND OF THE DEAD takes on the premise of picking up slightly where DAY OF THE DEAD left off, but really it has its own beginning and end. The film opens with the squad of militants left killing off the mindless zombies and dumping them in the garbage. Many of the dead are now walking the streets, but there's something very different about them now...and the lead Zombie (played in awesome fashion by Eugene Clark) is getting smarter. We see the zombies watching fireworks in the sky which seems to distract them so these militants can kill off the zombies one by one. Many of the survivors are now in an enclosed city run by the corrupt Mr. Kaufman (played by the as usual good Dennis Hopper, who seems to inhabit villain or corrupt roles with such gusto. Bravo Mr. Hopper!!), and the zombies roaming the streets in the wastelands of suburbs are starting to evolve. This was one of the best elements of the movie...giving the zombies some type of personality...they now realize their fate and what they have to do. It really makes the film quite interesting and a little bit creepier than most other films of this day and age. The zombies proceed, following the lead zombie, to infiltrate the city and eventually start killing off the population one by one. The gore in this uncensored version is absolutely creepy and you will cringe every time a zombie rips flesh, tears off a limb, or rips off a head. It almost looks realistic. There is more gore in this one then there was in DAY OF THE DEAD. The fast pace time of the movie (at 97 minutes long) also helps to make this a very entertaining and creepy entry in the DEAD film series. The ending was actually kind of smart too, but I don't want to give it away to anyone because you'll enjoy it yourself. Let's just say the zombies aren't completely killed off by the end and there is a destiny for them. Most of the actors, especially Leguizamo, Simon Baker, and the sexy Asia Argento, are all on their game here. Watch for a surprise cameo from none other than make-up stalwart Tom Savini...

George Romero continues to impress to this day, and LAND OF THE DEAD just further cements his status as an essential director in the horror film genre (and more specifically, the zombie genre). LAND OF THE DEAD presents a much different picture than DAY OF THE DEAD...and it's a great film that will continue the resurgence of horror films today.",1129766400,4,2749,4.529175050301811
1553771,3,B00005JO16,"This film didn't quite impress me on a grand scale, because the story and the performances were mediocre. I must give credit for the special effects and makeup team, because this film is visually engrossing and gorey consistently, and it goes beyond the level Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later has achieved. Though I find that this film got a bit tiring for me after seeing so many repetitious gun shots at zombies and zombies eating humans. It's not a scary experience, but it's more gruesome. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead more, because I loved Sarah Polley. With this film, John Leguizamo is more outstanding,  and Dennis Hopper is rather low-key for a villian. Anyways, if you want to see lots of bloody killing and explosions, then this is going satisfy your craving, and it might even lessen your appetite if you were eating during this film.",1129680000,,846,4.64
1553772,2,B00005JO16,"After my second watching of the film I realized what was wrong. No purpose, nothing to think about. The apocalyptic aura wasn't there. Questions of interest were missing; how many outposts of survival are there?, do we still not know the cause?, is their any government left and what are they doing?, any militery anywhere? Etc.

  The new zombie makeup was good at times but it looked too strained(figure that out). I understand the zombies have somewhat ""evolved"" but many of them moved too much like the living(even in gesture and emotion)to work for me. It's not a good idea at all to have a zombie acurately firing a gun of any kind. Big Daddy did nothing for me, because even in a far fetched zombie movietheir has to be some creepy believability. His makeup did not look real. Some totally decrepit zombies looked very mechanical(like a Halloween decoration). Sometimes the acting was decent, but wheres the interesting dialogue?. Regarding the plot, I think Romero got too caught up in trying to interject the Bush administration parallel(as he stated it was about)that he lost an opportunity at a better storyline. Every time I heard someone say,"" Get Dead Reckoning, I need Dead Reckoning"" or something to that effect, I'd think that sounds so scripted.

  I know pureists think it is sacreligious to say Dawn of the Dead 2004 was a better movie(which is beyond closeminded), but it was (except you don't have to be bit to become a zombie, just die). It was definetly filmed better. Romero created some moments in Land of the Dead(which is a terrible title) but you need more than gore to get an exciting and pondering horror flick. On this kind of movie, I can't go any deeper then that.",1129680000,3,1698,4.738983050847458
1553773,1,B00005JO16,"I have never understood the fascination with Zombie flicks.  Okay the originals by Mr. Romero I do have a degree of respect for.

But 28 Days later...it never occured to them to use the what little guns they had ON THE INFECTED PEOPLE; and watching a man getting brutally beaten to death made me wonder what the heck I was wasting my time on. Resident Evil:  The first one was entertaining to a degree.  Having the main creature be a Licker instead of the Tyrant left me less than pleased.  The Apocalypse one made me wish I had gone for the Sky Captain ticket instead.  Retarded and predictable and in no way entertaining or even fun to watch.

Dawn of the Dead 2004.  Did not give a rip.  Elploding heads don't wow me and the ever depressing ""everyone dies"" ending really annoyed me.  Like people don't experience enough feelings of hopelessness.  Is there really no escape from the hardships in this world?

Shaun of the Dead.  Pretty funny for the most part.  Someone had to make fun of these worthless films.  I really did not see how they can be taken seriously at all.  There is nothing scary about Zombies.

Land of the Dead:  I saw the preview and I said it looked retarded.  In fact I hoped that Mr. Romereo returned the genre he created to put an end to it.  I had nothing better to do while deployed in Japan so I checked out a showing with the thought that it might be better than I expected. I was wrong.  Anyone who has seen a Jason, Michael Myers or even Jurassic Park Film could see all the jump moments coming.  Every Zombie that popped up suddenly I already knew was coming. Nevermind that retarded Jurassic Park 3-like ending with the main characters NOT killing the zombies because they were ""Just trying to find a place to stay""  What kind of care bear, tree hugging, animal rights ending was that?  I honestly thiink this was an attempt at politics and the Zobies resemble the Gay community(Please, no offense intended, just a metaphor however morbid).  The Gay community was shunned from the get-go but as time has moved on and their community to has evolved and grown withing civilization it is now more accepted that when the first came out(of the grave or the closet).  Savvy?",1129680000,2,2203,4.5
1553774,4,B00005JO16,"Ah, it's finally come. I should open saying that I, like many of you, am a ravening Romero fanboy, and this was probably the second most anticipated film release yet to occur in my life. (And arguably, it should be number one. The actual #1 is 'Kill Bill, Vol. 2', which is, naturally, something of a cheat as it is the second half of single film, which is gonna severely increase the desire to view it.) But, though my anticipation was great, my expectations weren't actually all that high. For one thing, I'm sufficiently cynical that whenever I get really excited about something, I get really worried that it's not gonna be very good. Also, I'd read the script online, and although it clearly had the potential to be a very good movie, it certainly wasn't anything particularly remarkable or revelatory. Mind you, I certainly didn't think it was gonna be bad, but I was expecting something earth-shattering either. And, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it was excellent, and surpassed my expectations. It does little to stir the human soul, I suppose, but it offers plenty of gruesome action along with the best looking zombies ever and a script that is a cut above what you'd usually see in this sorta film. All in all, I'd say 'Land of the Dead' is about as good as you could reasonably hope.

One of the most impressive things about the original 'Dead' trilogy is how different the three films are. 'Land of the Dead' continues this trend, and it very unlike the 3 prior films, and is really about as original as one could reasonably expect a new film to be, while still remaining within the traditional zombie movie format. (Some professional reviewers disagree with me, but they don't spend nearly as much time watching zombie movies as I do, or you do, most likely.) This is the first genuinely post-apoclyptic zombie movie I've come across, in the sense that it is a zombie infested world in which a new human society has developed. This may not be the most remarkable twist in the world, but, again, it's about as big a one as your likely to have while remaining within the confines of the genre.

The plot centers around the crew of Dead Reckoning, a custom-built battle vehicle used to scavenge supplies from the zombie filled world. Riley is in command of the vehicle, an antisocial type who simply wishes to flee from both humans and zombies, and live in the frozen north. Cholo is second in command. He's something of a firebrand, compared to the controlled Riley, and he wants to buy his way into the Fiddler's Green, a high-class, privileged tower amidst the ruins of Pittsburgh. Kaufman, owner of Fiddler's Green, however, isn't interested in money alone, and wishes to keep lowly sorts like Cholo out of the Green. Enraged by his rejection, Cholo steals Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy the Green if he doesn't pay a large ransom. Not wanting to pay up, Kaufman hires Riley to stop Cholo, and bring the vehicle back. Riley has no love for Kaufman, but if Cholo goes through with his plan, a lot of innocents will be killed, and Riley sees this as his opportunity to flee the city. Meanwhile, one zombie called Big Daddy, enraged by the wanton slaughter of his fellow zombies in a recent raid, notices the grand tower at the center of the city, and heads of towards the living community, leading a pack of zombies, who are apparently rather inspired by his atypical drive and direction.

Though this film is moderately budgeted by mainstream standards(somewhere between 15 and 20 million), LotD has by far the highest production values of any Romero film. Despite the limited budget, Romero creates a full, convincing post-apocalyptic world, with a nice battle truck. (A truck which easily could've been very lame) Also, the zombie effects are the best you've ever seen, with easily the most varied and detailed faces around. Since this takes place years after the apocalypse, the zombies are in various states of decay, some fresh and mangled, some ancient and emaciated. Most impressive is one of the lead zombies, #9, who has her cheek ripped open, exposing her back teeth. It's a clever effect, and extremely realistic. Though many idiots whined about how the film was gonna be rated R, apparently unaware how much more lax the MPAA is compared to 20 years ago, this film more than delivers in terms of graphic violence. In terms of sheer volume, LotD is comparable to `Day', and it easily has the most flesh-eating of any of the Dead films. The gore is approached in a different way, as we don't watch a single character be mutilated to the extent they were in the prior two, but the sheer volume of effects is extraordinary. The natural effects are great, though the bites aren't quite as cool as they were in `Day'. There is some CGI, which is too bad, but it's pretty much unavoidable. As Nicotero mentioned in an interview, you can't just stick a squib on an actor's head anymore, and it would be totally impractical to put a squib on a stuntman every time someone had to get shot. The CGI is generally excellent, though it falters in one scene where a zombie's head is scissored off.

As the synopsis would suggest, this film falls into the action-horror category, rather than just pure horror. It doesn't completely abandon horror for action, however, like so many recent zombie movies have. Unfortunately, Romero relies to heavily on jump scenes, as zombies constantly leap from around corners or where ever. This is probably my biggest beef with the film. Fortunately, the jump-scenes usually aren't all there is to it: Once the zombies appear, they have to deal with them the way they typically did in the earlier films. Romero shoots the action and horror scenes old-school: keeps the damn camera still, lets you see what's going on etc. Mind you, I really like flashy camerawork, but this new school of camerawork ain't flashy, just incoherent and stupid.

Much has been made of how some of the zombies are smarter now, but this isn't really that important to the film. All that really matters is that one of the zombies becomes smart enough to actually actively attack the humans, rather than just wandering around, and the other zombies follow him. Yeah, the zombies pick up and use tools sometimes, but they did that in earlier Dead films as well, and their use of guns is utterly minimal. For the most part, these zombies behave precisely like your traditional Romero zombies. Well, towards the end it suggests that some zombies have  become intelligent enough that they're beyond eating people.  This is a little strange, but there are still plenty of mean, stupid zombies to go around.

While reading the script, it looked as if the characters would be a bit to cliched, but this proved not to be the case. Cholo looked like he might be too wild and uncontrolled, but Leguizamo holds back a bit with him, and makes him more real and naturalistic than he might have been. Similarly, Riley is basically your typical jaded soldier type, but Baker plays him more like a normal guy than an action hero. Hopper is typically known for being wildly over the top, but he plays Kaufman very low-key, as he should. Overall, the acting is very solid, though not much is typically asked of them. Special note should also go to Robert Joy as Riley's sidekick Charlie, a dimwitted sharpshooter. He's kinda used for comic relief, but he's endearing rather than obnoxious, unlike most sidekicks. These characters generally aren't terribly deep or complex, but they usually seem surprisingly real, like they did in Romero's earlier Dead films. (And unlike they usually do in this sorta film, where they often just go to the movie store, and buy a crate of `Generic, Clich Characters, 10 Count'. I'm looking at you, `Dawn of the Dead 2004'.) Unfortunately, Romero makes a few attempts at quips and catch phrases, most of which are quite lame. But, this sorta thing comes with the territory, and it isn't a big deal.  When I read the script, much of the dialogue was kinda hokey, but it plays better when you  actually see it.

Well, I guess that's it. This is just a very finely crafted zombie film, which finds a distinct niche in a very crowded subgenre. A fine return to the genre.

Update for DVD: The DVD itself looks very nice. (I really don't have that much of an eye for this sorta thing, however, so if others see some flaws they may be right.) As anticipated, the new cut isn't much different.  There's one new scene, about 3 minutes long, involving Cholo dealing with a suicide in an apartment.  It's a reasonably effective scene, and one of the more horror oriented sequences, but it hasn't really got anything to do with anything else in the film, however. (Which is why it was cut in the first place.)  It's got a bit more gore, with many shots extended slightly, and a few new things. (Such as one person getting their eye bit off, and Mouse getting ripped apart and disemboweled etc.)  Some people have been acting as if this version is way gorier, which is isn't, but it's got some notable additions, and further cements this film's position as having the best combination of quantity, quality and variety, when it comes to gore.  (Other than 'Day of the Dead', probably.  It's a tough call.)  I listened to the commentary, and it was acceptable, but not fascinating, and not nearly as interesting as Romero's ones generally are.  But, oh well, it's a fine DVD.

1553775,4,B00005JO16,"We should have known that if George A. Romero was going to go back to the well of the living dead another time he was going to come up with something different.  What ""George A. Romero's Land of the Dead"" (the director's name goes up top so you know this is not merely another remake of one of his zombie films, like last year's ""Dawn of the Dead"") offers is two variations on the familiar theme.  The first is in this brave new world humanity has found a way of perpetuating the old divide between the ""haves"" and ""haves not,"" even when there are all those zombies out there suggest it should now be ""us"" versus ""them."" Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) has set up Fiddler's Green, a luxury high rise on an island between a couple of rivers (think the location of Three River Stadium in Romero's old stomping ground of Pittsburgh even though the movie is shot in Toronto).  There the ""haves"" live while the rest of the island has the ""have nots,"" some of whom are hired as mercenaries to go out into the world and bring back ""necessities.""  Apparently money still matters in the ""Land of the Dead,"" or perhaps people are merely trying to hold on to the old way of life, because the poor are not listening to those advocating going and taking away from the rich.

Consequently, humanity has found a way to survive.  You can compare the more active approach of ""Land of the Dead"" with the mall rats of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" who found a passive means of existence.  Kaufman has built Dead Reckoning, a gigantic armored vehicle that leads foraging parties out into the world.  These parties are led by Riley (Simon Baker), whose primary goal is getting everybody back alive, which does not always happen.  That is because he works with Cholo (John Leguizamo), who has a different idea of necessities, one attuned to the fine tastes of Kaufman.  Both men believe they are on their last mission at the start of this 2005 film, Riley because he will have now earned enough to pay for a car to get out of town and Cholo because he believes he has now earned the chance to move on up to Fiddler's Green.  Both are wrong and that sets up the conflict to come.

This is where the second variation comes into play.  Kaufman not only created a high rise where the ""haves"" are protected from that ""have nots,"" some of whom actually help the ""haves"" have even more, but the entire island is zombie proof.  This forces Romero to change the zombie part of the equation, and so we are introduced to Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), who runs a gas station and has a moment akin to when the ape looks at the thigh bone in ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Just to help us along the voice over at the start of the film warn us that if the zombies ever develop anything approaching rudimentary thinking skills that would be a bad thing, a very bad thing indeed.  So, of course, that is what happens.  After all, if you can have bad humans, then you can have good zombies (Joss Whedon has convinced me being dead does not make a character inherently bad).

Having a zombie to root for is quite a different experience, but Romero also delivers on the guts and gore when the zombies go into their patented feeding frenzy.  The narrative can offer all the sly social satire it wants, we watch these movies to be disgusted by the bloody scenes of cannibalism.  The people Romero hires to do makeup and special effects are clearly on the cutting edge when it comes to this type of work.  Even when you watch the DVD special features and you see what they are doing in bright light most of it will still creep you out, so the scenes in the film shot at night or in the shadows with the liberal application of blood and other things it is even worse (which is a good thing in a zombie movie).

The bottom line is that Romero delivers just what his fans want with this movie so that there is not a problem with failing to meet expectations.  No, ""Land of the Dead"" is not the best of the bunch, but for my money nothing will surpass the original ""Night of the Living Dead.""  The important thing is that here we are four films into the series, limiting ourselves to just the Romero helmed ones, and the series is certainly going a lot strong than the other comparable horror series, all of which have been abandoned by their creators (which is either a cause or effect).  Final Note: Look for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright of ""Shaun of the Dead"" fame as the photo booth zombies in one of the classic cameos of the early 21st century.",1129680000,3,4473,4.386198547215496

This film didn't end like a Romero film, to me, the ending was weak, but I'm not gonna say for those who didn't see it.

But, I do like a lot of the characters in this films. The action and gore scenes are definitley cool. And like I said, the story is good, it's just weak compare to the other Dead films.

Anyone who would watch a movie about zombies and try to find the logic in it must be very close to zombie status himself. George Romero can do whatever he wants to do with his zombie movies, as should anyone else who makes a movie. When watching a movie of this sort,  throw logic out the window and just enjoy the freakin' movie! This happens to be a very good example of the horror zombie movie genre, and  George Romero is the master of the style. This is a fun film to watch and should be taken lightly. The idea of zombies showing some information processing and acting in a concerted effort to achieve a goal is very interesting and, very spooky. The way in which they solve the problem of crossing the river is scary, and the sight of thier nasty heads rising from the water is very effective.

1553823,5,B00005JO16,"I really wanted to see this movie when it came out in theaters, as I have become quite the George Romero enthusiast over the past few years and there hasn't been a new ""Dead"" movie in almost 20 years (if you exclude the remakes). But unfortunately, it dropped out of theaters just as fast as it arrived. But here, it arrives in all it's ""Unrated Director's Cut"" glory. It's surprising this movie didn't do very well, afterall, it was obviously only greenlit after the runaway success of zombie flicks such as last year's flacid remake of ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" ""28 Days Later"" and to a lesser extent, ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (whose creators appear in this movie). Don't let the box office disappointment steer you away from this flick though...

""Land Of The Dead"" is 100 percent George Romero. All of the elements that made the original ""Dead"" movies such classics are carried over here. Great characters, original and thoughtful story, loads of action, and let us not forget: gore galore. The special effects truly steal the show here, as this is hands down the goriest movie I have seen in a long time (although, I'm sure much of it was trimmed down in theaters). The effects look real, unlike most newer horror flicks, and are a refreshing throwback to the 70's and 80's. As for the cast? Dennis Hopper, John Leguizamo, Simon Baker, Asia Argento. What more can I say? Dennis Hopper is great as the greedy, self-appointed leader of a new society, John Leguizamo is perfect as the badass rebel looking for a way out, Simon is his opposite, the sympathetic hero and Asia (whose father, Dario, has close connections with Romero) plays the strong female bit, and a semi-love interest to Baker's character. The story picks up exactly where ""Day Of The Dead"" left off. Now that the Dead (or ""stenches,"" as they are referred to) have pretty much overtaken Earth, the upper-class citizens (i.e. those with money) have holed themselves up in a giant complex that serves as a new world, while the rest of the population are forced to fend for themselves on the street. There are obvious political undertones in this film that reflect on today's society (the supplemental material on the DVD further confirmed my theories) and in typical Romero fashion, it is pulled off very maturely, while still managing to entertain.

The movie isn't exactly perfect. My main gripe is that it is too short for it's own good. What I love about Romero's flicks is how you can get sucked into this alternate world he creates. Here, just as I was getting hooked, the movie was ending. But even still, it works well in it's 95 minute slot. All the actors were great in their roles, and the characters were well-written, despite the fact that there wasn't much time for exposition (I wish we could have gotten to see and gotten to know more of Argento's character though), and the best part: The zombies in this movie are REAL zombies. Not rabid, blood-thirsty animals. Don't get me wrong, I like today's zombie flicks, but nobody does it like George, and ""Land Of The Dead"" is a testament to that.",1129593600,9,3064,4.682745825602969

The gore was the best I have ever seen I give props on that however, as surprise factor and story line goes it sucked. I think George focused too much on gore than the story. I mean it takes place after the zombies pop up and kill people I like to see the lives of people before the zombies attacked. I was so anxious to get this movie but am dissapointed on how it turned out. I love George A. Romero it is just he should have made it better. I think Dawn of the dead the remake surpassed this one unfortunately. I hope there will be better ones in the future.

""Dawn"" left me with that hyper-creepiness the world we know is ending with people we know--who look like us--tearing us apart with gnashing teeth and eating our innards at a place we knew everyday, the shopping mall. Here we get an apocalyptic wasteland populated by ghouls with a city fortress of rich people and a second-class tier of people who fight the zombies for everyday items. It left me little to hold on to in terms of a ""this could happen now and today"" creepiness ""Dawn"" instilled but it still gave me my fix of zombie scares. The zombie munchfests still had me squirming in my seat. The characters were real enough given their setting and some moments were palpable in its sense of dread and creep (needed more daytime zombie scenes to make it more real).

I guess I lean towards ""Dawn"" as the epitomy of zombie creepdom (and NOT the remake with its uber Nike sprinting zombies that could have just as well have been just an angry mob and not the creeping unsleeping nonresting everpresent shuffling undead--). The makeup in ""Land"" is far superior to the blue-makeup, squib packing of the dead in ""Dawn"". But ""Dawn"" felt real--like it could happen--and that you were ""f""'ed if you didn't get your act together. But in ""Land"" you got your scares, your zombies, your apocalyptic wasteland Romero style and that alone is worthy of any zombie fans to check this one out.",1129593600,5,1579,4.599290780141844

The zombies just didn't have very good makeup in comparison to some of the recent zombie flicks inspiredy by Romero.  Other than that the signature social commentary of a Romero film is here.  The acting is pretty good and the story is just fine.  I actually like the idea of the zombies getting smarter.  It's a good zombie film but I jush wish Romero could keep up with his imitators and have some awesome looking zombies next time.  Yeah, I'd say this is worth your money.

Zombies with clean coveralls?

1553830,5,B00005JO16,"Coming into Land, I had a helluva lot of expectations. My biggest issue, was whether or not this would feel like another ""Dead"" film, or if it would reek of Hollywood. It's unfortunate that so many old filmmakers, who churned out some of the greatest horror and action films of all time, succumbed to this terrible disease so to speak. Wes Craven is a perfect example of this, as is John Carpenter nowadays. You can feel how much they toned down from each film, and how each was set to appeal to a mass audience of teenagers. My main concern was, if Romero was to bring Zombies into the mainstream, would it turn out as a massive step below the original trilogy?

Fortunately, as I walked out the theatre, I didn't feel that way. And currently, I'm overwhelmed with a sense of childish glee that I got exactly what I had hoped for. The film was filled with tension from start to finish, and I never knew what to expect next. The few 'jump out scares' that occurred in the film were no worst than those that appeared primarily in Dawn of the Dead (Day had very few of those, though Night had some), and they worked given the fact that the entire atmosphere outside of the city was so abandoned, and seemingly empty.

The concept of having a Caste system reinstated brings up a lot of ideas, and causes much discussion as to Kauffman's motives. While he is the typical money hungry bastard, he's also an ambitious, racist, money hungry, power seeking man who is so bent on returning to the old way of life, that he's willing to simply ignore the problem, which ultimately leads to the end of his 'perfect' society. He thought that turning his back to these creatures, would make them go away, and in effect, by leaving them untouched for so long, they evolved over time, just like virus' and bacteria do essentially.

What comes out of this is a characterization of these sub-humans that is a step past where Bub went in 'Day'. It's the next logical step for these creatures, and while we never get to see the trial and error of them trying to figure out what to do, one can assume that big Daddy isn't the first to start to evolve, as it's clearly visible that the majority of these zombies are trying to return to their previous state, unconsciously, or perhaps consciously. So when Big daddy picks up the gun, and it fires, the firing itself is purely accidental because his finger pushes on the trigger. He pushes again, it fires again. He points it at his enemy, pushes the trigger, it fires, albeit very inaccurately. Who's to say that he didn't go to rifle ranges in the past life? We'll never know. Like Bub who knew how to fire a gun from his previous life, he managed to take out Rhodes. As a gasoline worker, Big Daddy remembers subconsciously (Or otherwise) that s--- blows up. Henceforth. He's sort of the Malcom X of the zombies, helping them to reach a new awareness along with him, and taking physical action against those who trespass on their peaceful land. The primary zombies in the film do not eat people. The main 6-7 zombies only kill, which is evident of this new vengeful nature.

The other characters in the film, such as Riley and Cholo, Charlie, and the other main characters all have dialogue that suits their nature, and throughout the course of the film we get to know their personalities better, giving them depth that most horror movie characters would only hope to have. Charlie's interactions with Riley especially were interesting, in that it's not just a buddy buddy thing, but a mutual ""I watch your back, you watch mine"" sort of thing. Charlie is eternally loyal to this man, and it shows. Asia Argento is ****ing hot. otherwise, she plays a gritty ***** who knows how to get down and dirty, and has a reason: bringing Kaufman down. john Liguezamo finally gets his chance to be in a horror/action film, and he pulls it off well. Cholo is a character who's paid his fair share, and wants to get something out of it like all the others in the city, but Kauffman refuses, and decides to have him killed. Cholo's anger leads to the whole Dead Reckoning issue, and yet his greed takes over. Though before the end of the film, he recovers himself for one last hurrah. Hopper was one of the chief complaints of many reviews I've read, yet I thought he delivered a perfectly cold and calculating Executive who didn't want the flow of things disturbed, and went so far as to have people killed to prevent this. When he confronts Big Daddy in the final chapter of the film his line perfectly echo's his inability to let go of the old way of life. ""What gives you the right!"" He should in fact, turn this around on himself.

Gorehounds need not fear, as Romero delivers in the bucketload. I was, and still am amazed at how much he managed to get into the R, because we see intestines, people being ripped in half, people falling on their own grenades and being blown in half, squibs, latex bites (YES!), heads falling off, brains being splattered, arms, legs, hands, feet, spines. We see the entire thing, and it's thoroughly satisfying. Greg Nicotero did a wonderful job with the visuals and I can't wait to see what else was meant to be in the film on the uncut dvd.

In my opinion, even though the filming and the film itself has gotten better, the movie felt old. Much like I read on another review, it oozed of the classic style of filmmaking, where dialogue was driven by the characters and not words, and where the story had a loose destination, but was more about how they got there, not when they got there. While most films now tend to focus too much on entertainment, to the point where the audience taps their foot impatiently waiting for the next action scene, Romero succeeds in giving us characters we care about. He makes us enjoy the conversations they have, the interactions, and makes us look deeper into the movie, leaving the commentary wide open for interpretation as Nova said. It's very hard to rate this film against the other Dead movies, and as such, I won't. But I will say that this movie was thouroughly satisfying, and a completely and utterly worthy entry into the Holy Trilogy.",1129420800,2,6136,4.538392050587173

1553902,3,B00005JO16,"This 4th official entry in the series deals with events surrounding the fictional city area known as Fiddlers green, which is seen as a Utopia by the poorer ""undesirable"" citizens not deemed worthy of protection. The overlord of this area is the ruthless Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) who has a passing ideological resemblance to George W Bush. - ""WE DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS!"" he rants at his board when renegade mercenary cholo threatens to blow his tower up.

 Overall it's a decent film that doesn't have much in the way of social commentary like the great Dawn of the Dead and as such isn't memorable once the end credits role. The acting is good, but the roles aren't fleshed out enough. The violence is actually quite subdued and mostly takes place in the dark. It's really not  a graphic film overall.

The zombies are well done, with much blood letting allowed by Romero, even for an R. The unrated version is better, but I was hoping it would include more zombies and story.",1129248000,6,382,4.4714285714285715
1553904,4,B00005JO16,"I've seen it twice now and the first time I saw it as a Romero-fanboy. The second time it was with a more critical eye. I have to say that overall the film succeeds in what Romero was trying to accomplish. This is especially true in the fact that the film was his very first studio-financed zombie film. That shows in the overall look and pace of the film. I can't fault Romero for that since it allowed him to make the film when no one else would dare touch him with a 100-foot pole. The uncut and unrated DVD will probably show the definitive Land of the Dead, but as a theatrical studio film this fourth entry in the Dead series succeeds more than it failed.

First, the gore-factor in the film is more than I thought the MPAA would have allowed Romero, Nicotero and the boys at KNB FX would get away with. I think I can see where a few Romero-fans would have been disappointed in terms of what was showed after Romero's last two: Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead. Those two films raised the bar in terms of gore and splatter on the screen. This is especially true with Day of the Dead. But for an R-rated film Land of the Dead matches and surpasses what Saving Private Ryan showed in terms of on-screen carnage. The second time I saw the film I could tell where Romero had to pan or cut away before the gore became too over-the-top. Another trick I saw him do was (which I was prepared to look for after Greg Nicotero's AICN interview) was to have zombies walk across the scene in front of a feeding frenzy to minimize some of the effect. I am anxious to see what they cut-out to gain the R how it'll fit with the overall look and feel of the film when its put back for the DVD.

Second, the story itself is typical Romero in that it was a reflection of what he sees going on in the world at this moment, but with zombies to complicate things. To say that Romero is not a huge fan of the current administration is an understatement. Right from the beginning Land of the Dead is a commentary on Bush and company's approach on the War on Terror. Romero also uses the film as a way to point out the widening gap between the class structure in the United States. He's pretty much sledgehammer-like in his commentary. There's Kaufmann and his elite caste (which seemed to be white and affluent) living their life as if the zombie apocalypse that forced them into Fiddler's Green never occurred. Then you have the other castes which includes not just the grunts who are doing the dirty and dangerous jobs to keep everyone at the Green provided and satisfied, but the people who are deemed not Green-type: people who do not have the wealth and correct racial make-up. Then to complicate things there's an even larger caste just waiting to come in just beyond the electrified and guarded fence and the riverbanks. Romero's a child of the 60's revolutionary movement and his past zombie films' message points this out. This time around it comes out with less subtlety but with more force as if Romero knows that his kind of filmmaker are a dying breed and that this may be one of the last times he can send his message across through his film.

Finally, we come to the characters and most especially the zombies themselves. The zombie make-up effects done by Greg and KNB are to-notch and raises the bar on make-up effects overall. The zombies they've come up with look like what zombie would look if they've been moving around for years out in the elements. A few seem to have a much intact and less decayed look while some look to be more like walking, dried-out corpses. Either way Nicotero and team made great use of make-up and judicious use of CGI to give the zombies their best look to date. The human characters are pretty much sketched out according to who the good guys and bad guys would be. Riley as the main human hero is serviceable and Hopper as Kaufmann is less over-the-top than what most people would be used to when they think Dennis Hopper. In fact, Hopper portrays the ruthless Fiddler's Green executive with a certain Rumsfeld-esque and Cheney-esque approach. This is a person who thinks that people should be glad that he's in charge to make their lives easier and safer from not just the zombies but from each other. He's a poster-boy for the mindset that if the populace is entertained and placated with the trappings of the old life then they wouldn't complain of the problems that exist outside their borders. Sounds similar to a certain mindset a certain nation is in right now.

I must point out a couple of standouts in the film in the supporting characters of Charlie and Pillsbury. They're the comedy relief but not in the rip-roaring laugh-my-ass off funny, but in the way veterans of a war will joke and act to keep themselves sane and on the straight and narrow. Charlie seems to be the Lenny to Riley's George and the chemistry between Simon baker and Robert Joy works. Pillsbury was just on time with what little dialogue he had but right from the beginning the audience liked this character and I'm sure joined me in hoping he didn't become zombie-chow.

The zombie-hero characters are a little harder to describe. I know of people who were tuned off by their continuing evolution to something resembling human instead of the flesh-eating corpses that they were. Big Daddy's introduction as the de facto leader of the zombies in the film seemed abit rushed, but unlike some I thought his evolution was a continuation with what Romero began with Bub in Day of the Dead. One thing that I noticed that few missed was the fact that even though Big Daddy was still a zombie who was smarter than most he never partook in any of the flesh-eating from beginning to end. The same goes for the handful of zombies who really began learning from Big Daddy's example like The Butcher and Softball Player (number 9 as she is called in the credits). the rest of the zombies mimicked what Big Daddy was doing, but in the end their primal instinct to feed overrode whatever residual behavior they were learning. I thought this was something lost to most audiences and almost lost to me until I saw the film a second time and things began to click into place. There will always be zombies that gorehounds love for their ability to just feed-frenzy whenever they catch a living human, but interspersed among them will be the evolving ""Bubs"" who seem to want to be left alone. Does this mean that these ""Bubs"" will stop feeding on humans probably not, but they're not as mindless and emotionless as the majority of their brethren will remain as.

Overall, the film is an entertaining one if seen as a stand-alone. It's not as scary as the previous three in the series, but the films have progressively been getting less scary since Night of the Living Dead. The film seen as part of the series succeeds in continuing Romero's vision of what the zombies are. That they're not the real monsters in his film but just a reminder that they really are just us and their ability to collectively work together has always been their secret to always succeeding in finding a way into whatever defense humans have put up to keep them out. It is this working together that the surviving humans cannot learn and thus leads to their downfall. The title fits in that the land really belongs to the zombies now and the surviving humans are just temporarily living in it. I am not too big of a fan at what one of the characters did in the end, but it does show that with an evolving enemy out there the old ways of dealign with them may have to end and a new one found if humanity is to truly survive. I would give this film an overall score of 9 out of 10.",1129248000,17,7657,4.461812990720913

After 20 years I would haved liked to see more of an epic zombie adventure. I left the theatre feeling like I just watched an episode of Buffy as opposed to another 'dead' movie.
The dvd will be a directors cut but I don't see more then 10 minutes extra , if we're lucky.
Either way this had the same feeling as any other of the movies..more like a Day of the Dead 2, you know what I mean?
People have commented on how they shouldn't have 'evolved' the zombies, for example the zombie with the automatic rifle.
Remember the end of 'day' ? Romero would be taking a step backwards if he hadn't had our rotting buddies learn more.
Either way I loved the movie. The f/x were very much would you'd expect from Romero, which is more then welcome in a CGI world *Icannot remeber if he used any CGI in the movie, there might have been a bit*.
*edit-upon further viewing more CGI was used then once thought, it does however look fantastic, and on the plus side you won't see any CGI zombies runnin' around...causing trouble...stealings pens out of the ATM at the bank- *
There were a few scenes that made you cringe, which is what you look for in a movie like this! Make-up effects have gotten a lot better and should be used more often.
CGI or makeup , either way you can tell it's fake but it's nice to show someone interacting with someone or something other then in front of a blue screen.

1553908,3,B00005JO16,"I just sat here and read every review for this movie in one sitting.  It took a while (with over 130 reviews in tow), and as I finished reading this literary mass of arguments, gripes, and disagreements I felt compelled to leave my two cents.

Land of the Dead is a decent zombie flick.

Nuf said!

Trust my opinion, as my collection contains every worthy zombie movie, including most of the ""questionable"" titles (such as City Of The Walking Dead, The Video Dead, Supernaturals, etc...)

To be honest, I had very high hopes for this movie when I first saw it in theaters, and was planning to see it in theaters 10+ times.

I only watched it twice.

The first time I watched it I was very let down and basically waited a few weeks in disgust before I watched again.

I was shocked at the fact that I didn't like this film (I'm a Romero nut), but then I realized something.

The original ""trilogy of death"" (NOTLD/Dawn/Day) I've watched countless times (also including the NOTLD remake) in the privacy of my own home.

Viewing them over and over, until I have the lines, scenes, and background music engrained into my head.

While none of these movies are perfect or flawless by any means, they will be forever remembered as the films that spawned an entire subgenre of horror movies.

(I don't care what anyone says, NOTLD created the zombie movie, as zombie flicks before NOTLD dealt with voodoo and dancing with chicken bones)

The B&W classic was raw and basic.

Land Of The Dead arrived on the coattails of a few successful zombie flicks (28 Days Later, Resident Evil, and the Dawn remake).

I own each of these movies, and saw them in the theater too, so it's no argument that these are great zombie flicks.

But for everyone and their grandma to sit in here and bash LOTD is insane.

You should be grateful that Romero had another chance to expand his undead world using a larger Hollywood budget.

Although I agree that this movie is not as polished and ""perfect"" as the Dawn remake it's still an entertaining ride, and I'll be happy to place it alongside my other zombie flicks in my collection.

The visuals were great, the acting was better than most zombie flicks, decent pacing, and every scene had smudge of Romeros thumbprint.

That was the main problem with this flick, it's more of a smudge than a clear representation of what Romero actually wanted to produce.

Think about it, Romero had been trying for years to scrounge up the dough to continue his ""dead"" movies, but Hollywood turned up their nose.

Then, once a few ""shot in the dark"" non-Romero directed movies made some money, Hollywood went to the source (Romero) to make another one.

(Remember that Romero was supposed to make the Resident Evil movie, but was dumped from the project, reportedly because it was too dark and twisted, so Hollywood went for the kinder gentler Resident Evil movie)

I could bet money that this movie was quite different when it was first being shot (as it did go through several re-titles and script alterations along the way) and somewhere along the way Hollywood pressured Romero to change the movie into something else.

(You know he wanted more blood and gore, but Hollywood probably cut it out)

All in all thi is a solid zombie movie and will surely be in every zombie fans collection sooner or later (I guess once the anger subsides).

Support the genre and more of these movies will be made, if we turn up or noses at every flaw or problem in a movie and don't see it or buy it, then we may not get anymore zombie flicks worth watching.

Okay, you've been warned.  I'm no movie critic, so I won't get into the details of exactly what I thought worked and what didn't.  But to put it bluntly, I just thought that the plot in this movie was very dull and moved at a snail's pace, and I kept looking at my watch through the whole movie hoping it would end soon so that I could go and do something fun.  It just was a flat movie and didn't hold my interest at all.  But the worst part, to me, was that this movie ends exactly the same way as past living dead movies have ended.  I was hoping for something new, but no such luck here.  The survivors of the movie, once again, pack up and move on, probably to never be heard from again in the next movie of the series.  It's time for this series to go in a different direction.  Either someone needs to come up with a way to destroy all the zombies and save the world, or just something DIFFERENT.

I've always been a fan of the living dead series, but it's becoming obvious that the series is on life support.  Someone with some talent needs to come forward and write a new, fresh, exciting script to bring the series back to life, rather than repeat the same storyline over and over again.  If a plotless story and bloodshed are enough to satisfy you, then you may enjoy this movie.  Otherwise, I would recommend the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake over Land of the Dead - I thought it was MUCH MUCH better.  I know, it's a remake and we all know the story by now, but trust me, Land of the Dead offers nothing new, so you're not missing much if you don't watch it.",1128556800,,1752,4.096774193548387

If the point of the movie is to say that all rich or above average income white people are evil and that the murderous crimanals  are really the victims/good people....well I got it, thanks for the heads up Mr. Romero, I'll quit my job tomorrow and burn all my money.

It was about humans fighting for the rights to stay in this safe building. How dumb is that! The zombie were so dumb in this movie as well. I mean come on..a zombie playing music. Im sorry but I find that ridicoulous. I always pictured zombies walking around slow and moaning. In this movie they have machine guns. I just find that dumb. This movie also needed more action.

Despite some reviews in the press to the contrary, the film does have a great script and the lines to these ears were NOT cheesy (and certainly not compared to most of the Hollywood blockbusters).

The art direction, effects and acting were all sufficient enough to carry Romeros scipt to the screen in grand style. If I had any gripe then it was that I would of hoped to see Dennis Hopper's character Kaufman being more of a shouty bad guy in the tradition of Rhodes from 'Day of the Dead'. However, that is only a minor quibble and I very much look forward to seeing the film again but in its uncut format (on dvd) which I  imagine would include the obligatory Romero gutting of people's stomachs that we all know and love?!

Romero's zombie movies were never just flash and gore.  They were mirror glimpses at ourselves and the way we live our lives.  The true horror didn't come from the flesh eating ghouls, it came from our own behavior.  Land of the Dead, as well as the previous three movies is a thinking persons horror movie.

And then there is the politics *sigh* Sometimes I think Romero is stuck in the 60's still with his stero-types. White males are usually the bad guys and his females are ever fighting for liberation from dumb white males while all the real fighting is done by highly intelligent black males(huh?)...A nice idea to put out in the 50's,60's or even 70's but it looks like a pretty dumb social moralizing to try to sell in 2005-anybody still buying?

1554047,4,B00005JO16,"And gorefest.  George A. Romero has come back with a slick horror film with some clever ideas in it.  Though the story itself is not original, Romero successfully gives several twists to it, making the whole film good, solid entertainemt with his trademark satires (which are greatly helped by dark humor).

Unlike the last year's remake of 'Dawn of the Dead,' the film avoids the humans vs the undead formula.  Instead the humans are living in a sanctuary city 'Fiddler's Green' where Dennis Hopper's magnate Kaufman virtually reigns (like exectives in black suit), and mercenaries are hired to 'pillage' food, drink, and other things from the towns outside where the zombies roam in the traditional way (oh, and this time, they don't run.)

[REVENGE OF THE ZOMBIES] we learn that one zombie 'Big Daddy' couldn't stand it.  Believe it or not, he starts to learn how to use weapons, and leads a troop of fellow zombies to Fiddler's Green. Besides this gory battles between humans and zombies, there is a conflict between humans (well, that's the new part) between a hard-nosed mercenary Cholo (John Leguizamo) fed up with the life of doing dirty works, Kaufman (with Hopper's usual mannerism as baddie), and another mercenary and our reluctant hero Riley (Simon Baker).  Asia Argento and Robert Joy also appear, offering help to Simon Baker's character.

The script is fine, if not superb, but anyway Romero is a great storyteller, so this story will do.  He also knows how to entertain and surprise us with timely editing and occasional sly humor, so even when the familiar gimmicks are employd (like a zombie hiding somewhere and coming out suddenly, or the camera panning to and fro suggesting something is hiding there), the results are different, mostly better than imitators' tricks.

Prodution designs and photography are both good, and some scenes are really memorable (my favorite: 'scared' zombies). But probably the success of the film is due to the good acting from Baker, Joy, Argento, Leguizamo and Hopper.  Considering the numbers of the people (or extras) eaten by the zobmies, surprisingly many main characters survive in the end, and this may suggest the studio is considering a sequel.  If so, I heartily welcome the decision, and am ready to see it.  And thank you Mr. Romero, this is what we wanted to see.",1126569600,5,2327,4.951156812339332
1554048,5,B00005JO16,"I've got two reviews, Soldier. You can smoke 'em if you got 'em while you read:

REVIEW#1: Is the ""Zombies-crashing-through-the-barricades-haul-your-a**-into the Dead Reckoning NOW, Soldier!"" version. ""Land of the Dead"" is some seriously bent, proudly trashy, flamboyantly bloodthirsty good times---nothing profound, not a zombie epic, perhaps---but it's like a big, juicy steak. If you like a nice saucy side of carnage with your Zombie Apocalypse, you've come to the right place, pardner. Chow down!

REVIEW#2: This one assumes you've barricaded the gun-shop and you've got some good hunkering-down time.

Alright, think about this one: the Zombie Apocalypse has arrived. Maybe it was some green goo that hitched a ride on the new Neptune XIII probe that just crashed to Earth.

Or maybe it was some weird cosmic dust that passed through the atmosphere; or maybe it was a biochemical spill the Military didn't quite cover *all* the way up. Maybe, just maybe, some wild-eyed eco-freaks got a little too rowdy in the Monkey House section of the local Super-Dooper-Secret Biowarfare Research Laboratory.

Maybe, even, there's just no more room in Hell. And, well, you know the rest.

Who really cares about Cause, when the Effects are shambling all over town, trying to take a chunk out of your hide when all you want is a little peace, a little quiet, maybe a halfway decent smoke break.

So anyway, you're a total uber-bada**, let's say, or maybe a survivalist, or you're just packing heat and keeping a cool head when things go south and the Dead Rise and start looking for some truly 100% American ground beef. You rally some bikers and soldiers and street thugs and seriously scared civvies to your side, you build up an arsenal (the Zombies aren't gonna use shotguns and M-16s, anyway), and you clear out some space. Make a safe zone.

Soon you begin to realize it might be a juicy idea, once you've got some breathing room, to fortify central Pittsburgh, barricade the bridges, trip-wire the whole area, spike with some guard towers, and settle down.

And when the smoke clears, you and your main Posse---the guys with you from the start, or maybe just the really scary critters---you start thinking: Hey, we made this place. We've got a little fortified City. As for Law & Order---well, the Constitution, the President of the USA, even the old US of A herself---all that has gone the way of the Dodo & the T-Rex.

You're the Law, the Big Kahuna, the A-Number One. You set up your digs in the most lavish downtown skyscraper you can seize, fortify it, trade in the kevlar and camo for some Armani suits, and dispatch the peasants (all the scared normal folk who don't want to be eaten, ie, outside Fortress Pittsburgh) to the dead zone to bring back food, booze, guns, and cigars.

As for your Living Large skyscraper---Fiddler's Green---, whaddya do? You do what any power-hungry dictator would do, given half a chance: you Charge Admission.

That, zombie-hounds, is the guts and glory of ""Land of the Dead"", the blood-and-guts return of the Grandmaster of the Zombie Splatter Spectacular, George Romero. It's a wild world of Haves & Have-Nots, but this time the Rich *are* just like us. They're still human; the Have-Nots, on the other hand, just want some flesh for chow. So yeah, it's very Biblical: the Meek have inherited the Earth, along with a very nasty appetite.

Throw in evolving zombies, a not-so-subtle post-9/11 subtext, bottle-rocket pacing, a storehouse of quotable quotes (from Dennis Hopper's ""Zombies..they give me the Creeps, Man"" to the hulking Manolete's ""So let's DOOOOO some-THEENG""), a scantily clad Asia Argento in a cage with two really hungry zombies, and a class-clambering John Leguizamo and a full-bore rampaging Dennis Hopper---and you've got good times.

It's too short by far, and it could have reached for more---but Romero has conjured up a brazen, bloody, irreverent, wantonly trashy, and totally politically incorrect helluva ride.

This one is way overdue. Dig in.

It brings absolutly nothing new to the genre.

And even in his gore elementals there are fare better films to buy.

So whats the plot of this film: our hero is leader of a band of raiders. They are traveling around the country to get some food and stuff for one of the last cities with humans. This city is ruled by an big bad Boss (Mr. K). Now our hero wants to quit this job and travel on his own to Canada (a land where nobody lives). To do this he must complete one last job for Mr. K. He must bring back an real big armed truck, stolen by one of his former co-raiders.

At the same time one of the undead (called stinkers) comes to genius. He starts to think and guess what...he rounds up some other stinkers and goes to the city for a little event (you know with some drinking and eating).

Alas in the end the city is lost, Mr. K. is dead, our hero saved some citiesens and travels to Canada.

The plot is not worth one dime. Mr. Romero starts some social working....but with an sledge hammer. The FX...i (and surley you too) have seen far better. The characters of the film are all acting like in some comics (poor Dennis Hopper) and there part is so boring (for a sample: there is someone hidding in an area full of zombies...whats he doing? he uses a walkman so he can't hear any of the zombies comming....real clever).

I guess after the remake of Dawn of the Dead Mr. Romero wants to make some money too...so why not another zombie-film?

Dawn hinted to the zombies dormant memories of their former existence, and Day proved that zombies could use guns. Romero also seems more sympathetic toward the zombies in this movie. This was a great movie, and well worth the wait, a lot of people will complain that the smarter zombies ruin the whole thing, but I think it's because they're getting smarter that makes it a lot better.

A true example of Romero's genius, this was truly a keeper for fans. I was really glad I went to see it when it came out and the audience pretty much enjoyed it.

However, the movie was not bolstered by 28 Days Later (an awful movie) nor RE, but it's bolstered as a great zombie flick because of the fact that's it's done  by the Master of Zombie

movies, George A. Romero.

Romero knows how to do zombie flicks, the ones every other third rated director (Paul W.A Anderson, Uwe Boll), try to copy but fail miserably at it.

Why do they fail? Crappy special effects,limited or no story, bad directing, well with the master at the helm that wasn't going to happen, nor we're we going to have a major disaster on our hands. Romero really gave his followers something good again, and he needs to recognized again for it.

The fourth zombie flick in the Dead saga finds a couple of renegades for hire who work for a rich white tycoon named Kaufman (excellenty done in fashion by Dennis Hopper).

Hopper as Kaufman was deliciously evil, humorous and twisted. He reminded of George W. Bush in a way, he is an evil conservative who could care less about people dying in his own country,

all he cares about is making a profit, and saving his own hide all the while spewing propaganda about what he's done when everything he's done has been for himself.

This is actually an element of the movie from interviews George A Romero has given that he actually wanted to do more. Besides giving us a great zombie flick to eat out popcorn with he wanted to implement political and social satires. Always the brilliant

director as he did with Dawn of the Dead, he does so here. Well done George.

The gore for the movie was extremely high so gorehounds will not be disappointed at all. There's also certainly a high amount of action and pulse pounding violence and suspense to keep people in their proverbial seats for the whole viewing. This truly is a great movie.

Even Tom Savini has a cameo in the movie.

Moving on the mercenaries after killing many zombies, have a fallig ou. Cholo (John Leguizamo) who as another Latino actor and one of the best gives a great performance, takes into custody Dead Reckoning the advanced zombie killing machine unit. Riley (Simon Baker) hates Cholo ruthlessness but deep down they both are the same.

Anyhow Kaufmann enlists Riley's help in getting the thing back all the way Kauffman has ideas of his own. Eventually everyone gets what they deserve at the end and of the top of that we have two hours of non stop zombie action!!!

To sum up, this is a great zombie flick, and it's a great horor movie overall, George A Romero kicks butt and maybe Uwe Boll and every other mediocre horror director could learn a lot from him.",1125619200,8,2781,4.532

Some act as if Romero is the one who created the ""Zombie"" character itself. After I saw this, I ripped up the movie ticket and threw it in the streets. First off, the story went to the sh***er, and the entire world he created was a joke. Zombies using guns? Give me a break. A Black Zombie is their leader? What the hell is going on in Romero's head? Zombies are dead tissue with a dead brain that still functions in some sort of dumb state of mind. Its moving dead flesh with active brains, thats all they are. I can understand holding a weapon or carrying something, but using guns? O come on!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horrible!!!!!!!!! Thats why i hated Day of the Dead as well. Trying to make zombies think and do things is pretty pathetic. Dawn of the Dead the orginal still will always surpass all zombies films, well except for Night of the Living Dead :-), gotta have respect for the ancients. Anyway, George Romero left his zombie genre in the toliet. I think when Romero filmed this, the Zombies got to him, and he became what he made, dead walking flesh, with an active dumb brain.

But I recommend if you want to see a true zombie film, rent or buy: Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead 1978 version, 28 Days Later, and Dawn of the Dead remake 2005. DO NOT BUY LAND OF THE DEAD! PURE FILTH AND CRAP!

Michael Jackson's Thriller video as short as it might be, is a masterpiece itself of how the undead is truly protrayed, that being said, Mr. Romero's new crapper piece brings tears to my eyes. Knowing from his two best well down NOTD and DOTD has come to this point that he has been dead himself since 1979, and has never risen above or beyond those two movies.",1125360000,5,2074,4.2773536895674305
1554117,1,B00005JO16,"The original concept for the movies which made them so great are that you take a group of people who are forced into a situation where they are forced into a plan for survival.

Now in this train wreck you get a movie with a bunch of jar head mercenaries with an unlimited supply of ammo that appears more like RESIDENT EVIL 3 or Apocalypse Now 2. The characters are as flat and personality less as anything you've seen in a Lifetime afternoon movie. Now here you get a hand full of MAIN zombies which are not only boring but are now more intelligent than the living people running around. I mean WTF happened between Day and Land? You get a big bald black Zombie which happened to be the zombie leader now, commanding his troops (unliving) through a dozen or so GRUNTS and GROANS, which surprisingly enough the dead understand. I mean we get a taste of zombie intelligence in Day of the Dead but here it goes too far. I mean what happened to the dead rising for the taste of flesh? Now its just cartoonish. I mean I really couldn't care less who got bitten or killed I was more interested in the zombies but even that got tired due to the focus not being on different zombies but on the select few, the black gas station worker, the cheerleader etc. Booooring. I mean this is the movie ""we've waited for""? Maybe Romero should take a Que from DAWN OF THE DEAD 2004 which was what the movies were all about. You cared about the actors, you cared about the characters you cared who was gonna die. Making specific zombies the focus makes the flick seem out of the realm of horror. Many people dislike DAY for this reason. And really, all it does is make them look like mentally disabled people...not scary ""rip your flesh off and eat your insides"" zombies.

And for the main reason people dug the films...you take a group of people and pit them against the dead in a fight for survival. I can only hope for a remake of Day of the Dead and not by Romero. Sad when all the flicks that came out such as , 28 Days Later, Shaun of the Dead etc, are much better movies than this piece of forgettable nonsense.

1554118,5,B00005JO16,"...or you will miss the message.

After a 20 year long wait George A. Romero has finally come back with another installment in his Living Dead Series. If you are a fan of the series and you still haven't seen Land of the Dead yet you really don't need to read any further. You should just pick up the DVD or rent it already...but not after getting a CT Scan on your brain.

The Plot of Land of the Dead is as follows:

It has been at least a decade since the dead began to walk and feast upon the living and the survivors haved holed themselves up in a fortified Pittsburgh. Riley, the main protagonist, is paid to drive into ""enemy territory"" to search for supplies in the outlying towns to bring back to the city (A place divided into the poor and destitute who live in the dregs of the city and the rich, ""finer"" class of people that live in opulence in a  skyscraper called Fiddler's Green). Riley's help consists of a mentally retarded best-friend, a group of mercenaries, and a big mother of an assault truck called ""Dead Reckoning"".

But Riley has noticed something.

The dead appear to be getting more intelligent and he decides that this can only be a bad thing. Meanwhile Cholo (the second in command) decides he has done enough dirty work for ""The Man"" (namely Kaufmann, the man who runs Pittsburgh) to earn himself a spot in Fiddler's Green.

And this folks...is the beginning of the end. I could spill more but anything else would be giving away too much.

Let me just say that Land of the Dead is not for everyone. If you are somebody that holds Dawn of the Dead or Night of the Living Dead up to every zombie movie as a measuring stick you will probably be a little disappointed. Land of the Dead is actually rated ""R"" (as opposed to being ""unrated""), it is roughly 1 1/2 hours long, the ""message"" of the film appears to be worn on its sleeve, everybody doesn't die in the end, and it is a fast-paced action film generously garnished with the living dead...and it is just plain fun to watch.

Any number of those little tidbits will turn any traditional zombie movie lover off...and that would be a sad, sad thing. Firstly, this is the most graphic R rated film you will probably see in a long while (unless, of course, you are watching the ""Unrated Edition"" which would make this whole paragraph moot). It doesn't tip-toe over the edge of PG-13 territory like the Resident Evil films...instead it lovingly teeters on the brink of NC-17. You will see things in this film that other horror films of recent memory would be too afraid to throw on the screen...things you haven't seen since the 80's in a new film.

Don't believe me? Watch it.

As for the ""message"": Land of the Dead while appearing to be a movie about class structure in America is actually a cleverly disguised indictment of the U.S. government's role in the Middle East for the past 20 years. And yes, I am a history major...and yes, I am serious.

Dennis Hopper's character, Kaufmann, and Fiddler's Green is the symbolic representation of the U.S. government in the eyes of world. Kaufmann wants to keep everything for himself, he wants to keep the ""lower class of people"" out, and he wants complete and utter control.

Cholo, John Leguizamo's character, represents Middle Eastern interests during the 80's. Kaufmann funds him and supplies him with weapons to do ""the dirty work"" (as it is described in the film) that he can't do himself. Cholo, when he finally gets screwed over by Kaufman, is enraged and decides to use the very weapons Kaufman gave him against the city in blind, arrogant retaliation.

Both are ignorant to their role in everything...and both are in for a literal ""Dead Reckoning"" as their worlds coming crashing down around them.

Don't believe my take? That is fine. The wonderful thing about these movies is that no two opinions are ever exactly the same and what I get out of it, you may get something radically different.

Trust me, there is more to Land of the Dead than ""sky flowers"" and if you just focus on them you will miss what is going on around you.

If you love zombies, intestines, head shots, dark humor, and an underlying message to your films you can't go wrong with Land of the Dead.",1124928000,11,4205,4.5263852242744065

1554179,4,B00005JO16,"I saw 'Land of the Dead' completely out-of-order from the other Romero zombie movies, having seen Day of the Dead first, then Land of the Dead', and then Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead. However, that said, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the movie. As a zombie movie, it's great fun. There's plenty of zombie screen-time and gore aplenty, and the acting really wasn't half-bad. The actors put up performances that well exceeded what I had expected, and the plot was pretty solid. Dennis Hopper plays the villainous Kaufman very well, and Riley was really a pretty likeable character.

There were a few things I wish had been done differently (such as how the big-money vehicle, Dead Reckoning, was used), and I'd have liked to see some more of the downfall of the human city, but for the most part I got exactly what I wanted: zombies messing stuff up. The gore actually wasn't as gratuitous as I was expecting, and frankly, that was a good thing - it made sense when it was used (I mean, it's a movie about zombies ripping people apart and eating them), but it wasn't distracting or really over-the-top.

While Land of the Dead isn't my favorite zombie movie (that honor goes to the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake), it's still very well worth your time, and I'm looking forward to buying it on DVD when it comes out.",1123632000,4,1335,4.512396694214876

I can't even remember when this all begun to me, the problem is, I am used to see him as an outsider of what hollywood stands for, his movies were explicit disturbing and strong, something I never seen anywhere else, and, well, it's really painful to admit, but I think he gave himself to the industry, at least in this ""Land"". The movie is not bad, and being a fan I only can be suportive, but there is something wrong about it, it looks like a regular hollywood movie, and this was not what I was expecting, don't get me wrong, it's far superior than most part of movies out there, but still lacks some raw cruelty that the other zombie movies have, specially in the end.

1554182,3,B00005JO16,"I must admit.  I was really excited to see this movie.  I have been a big fan of the original dead trilogy for a long time and dreaming of the day when the fourth dead film is released.  Going in to the theater, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I am only 22 and I suppose slicker and more fashionable zombie movies of the day I had seen prior to LOTD just turned me off to it.  One of the problems I have with it is the whole zombies remember how to do things bit.  It was ok in Day of the Dead because they didn't go too far with it.  I had heard this movie would be about a lot of that, and I thought ""if they do it right and don't go too far, it will be good.""  Sad to say, they went too far.  Another problem I have with it is it feels choppy and not very flowing.  The progression of the film follows a pattern that is hard to get used to: speeds up, slows down, crawls, speeds up, crawls, etc.  Perhaps an unrated version of the film might help fix this.  Overall, it's my least favorite of the Romero Dead films.  The gore is fantastic, the zombies look great but it wasn't the Dead film I had been waiting for.  Maybe I'm just too demanding.  If I were a zombie that could think and act, I would have gotten my hands on Dead Reckoning and plowed my way to food.",1122940800,2,1267,3.9137254901960783
1554183,4,B00005JO16,"Romera's directorial style is one that I call ""slick immediacy"". He shows the zombies in the all of their glory early and quite often just as he did in the other 3 movies. And just like in the other 3 movies, he introduced something much scarier later in the film...humans being human. He seems to ask himself ""why wait to introduce the monsters when I can show them now and still provide something much scarier later?""

The movie opens with a shot of zombies exhibiting the behaviors of their former lives. It's an interesting development though I question the plausibility of some of its aspects. In the case of the marching band zombies, how can ""the dead"" make sounds on wind instruments when they have no lungs?

The zombies have overrun the world by their sheer numbers and humans are left banned together in comparatively small gatherings. In the case of the main characters, they're part of a city protected on all sides by water. Most of the people of this city are seemingly homeless while an elite few are able to live in a fortified tower owned by a rich man. Occasionally, supplies not available in the city are needed and are retrieved by going to an area teeming with zombies using a zombie proofed war machine called ""Dead Reckoning"". Life, while not great, is at least zombie free for the inhabitants of the city. How does it all go wrong? The zombies have ability to learn and, at least according to George Romero, humanity refuses to and that to me is the scariest aspect of this movie.

You have the requisite hero types of course but the movie is filled with those who are simply sloppy as well as those who are arrogant and greedy. Romero's ""social/societal commentary within the story"" aspect is readily apparent but nicely done.

The zombies in this 4th (and final?) movie are better than ever. Romero and others involved have incredible imaginations to think of all of those different zombies. My favorite...the headless (or nearly) zombie. See the movie and you'll know what I mean. I couldn't tell when CGI was being used. The graphics were seemless to me. Also, Romero may have paid homage to a movie that I heard was one that influenced him with a sequence where the zombies learned that water was no obstacle. As they slowly came out of the water, it reminded me of a similar scene in the ""Carnival of Souls"".

I found George Romero's Land Of The Dead to be very entertaining and a worthwhile addition to the ""Night Of The Living Dead"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"" and ""Day Of The Dead"" trilogy.",1122681600,2,2516,4.607142857142857

1554185,4,B00005JO16,". For once in one of Romero's Dead flicks we get to see many of the main characters live. I liked the characters in LOTD a lot. I think that this film had good to great acting. It was definitely funny, I thought that Dennis Hopper was a scream. He did an excellent parody of the stupid rich CEOs that try to control our lives. The heroes were as well developed as the previous films in the series. I mean, do we really know that much about the other characters in the other dead films. If I recall, not really. In the other films, just when the audience gets to know and like a character, they usually get bumped off. At least with LOTD, there is a possibility that these guys have a real chance to live past the credits and into the next film. That is, if Romero wants to use some of the same characters in the next Dead film. As for the explosions, violence, nudity, and all the other fun stuff, it fits because it reflects our times. With the exception of the nudity and hot lesbians, tune into the news and you get to see the violence and explosions every night. Romero is just thrusting that point in our face so that we open our eyes to that. The violence in the film is not pretty and for once I felt sorry for the zombies. They had a right to be pissed, and Big Daddy, the lead zombie, was right in rallying the troops.

Well, if I said too much, I didn't mean to bore anyone. But I'm sick of certain people ripping this film. If you don't like it, fine. Instead of sitting at your computer typing, make a better movie. Go on, give it a try.

It's a good vs evil metaphor, the rich in their tower vs the masses of poor barely staying alive. Two main characters are soldier henchmen for the penthouse ruler (Dennis Hopper), there is even a little character development for these guys, again the good and evil motif. a few questions for thought (can you really escape going NOrth, can you really rebuild society without rulers, can the zombies really evolve to think) help pass the time pleasantly enough waiting for the next big shooting scene.

cool shooting, excellent zombie makeup, lots of extras zombie walking around, super vehicle attack platform for technies, a real cut above mindless entertainment.

Not only was it the ""must see in the theatre"" types, but it fit into one of my favorite genre's in both movies and books, post apocalypse.

Land of the Dead, brought a return of George A. Romero to the genre that has made him a legend. Romero does zombies like no one else. While I am a fan of zombies and such, in the hands of Romero, the gore is intense but not pointless and the story isn't just about chills and thrills but a commentary of society. In Land of the Dead, Romero takes a new turn that he only touched upon in his last ""dead"" movie, Day of the Dead. In Day, Romero created zombies as not just issuers of mayhem, but potential sympathetic antiheros. Romero develops that concept even more in Land of the dead. Here, the true evil is not the zombies, but the greed of the powerful.

Easily Romero's best produced movie, thanks to finally a workable budget. He breathes a new life into the dead, while the few human hero's in the tale search, not for riches, but for peace. My only true complaint in the movie, is that his human villains were much less developed than his zombie villains. Dennis Hopper plays the quintessential evil rich man, yet his portrayal could have appeared in any number of movies, without the supernatural aspects of Land of the Dead. Hopper basically is just a rich, greedy bastard who will do anything for money. Romero doesn't explain what good paper money will do you in a society overrun by the walking dead. I truly doubt the gold standard existed, and society has become more about bartering and scrounging. It seemed a cheap cop out of a villain.

Yet, past that this movie took us places yet unseen in the genre. Romero busted apart the clichs that we have seen. We have some decent living dead movies recently, namely the Dawn of the Dead remake and 28 Days Later. Yet, Romero's vision remains the freshest.",1121299200,3,2028,4.402666666666667
1554267,4,B00005JO16,"First of all, let me say that it's pretty much essential to have seen the other Romero movies leading up to this one (NIGHT, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD).  Not because they are so plot heavy that you get lost if you skip one, but because there are two ""progressions"" you need to follow to fully enjoy these movies.

First, we see the actual progression of low budget film making.  Unlike ""indie"" films, where directors make small movies with small stakes with small budgets, the ""DEAD"" movies are large scale movies made on a small budget...hence, low budget.  An ""indie"" film usually has enough money.  A low-budget film requires the filmmaker to accomplish something big on a shoestring, requiring a different type of problem solving.  The first film was black and white and contained its themes within a small house.  DAWN was contained mostly in a mall, but we got glimpses of the outside world and the growing catastrophe.  DAY was confined to a bunker, but again the global scale was growing.  And now the new film in state-of-the-art stock with CGI backgrounds takes the low-budget to the next level.  You are actually seldom aware the budget is low.

And you get to follow the track of Romero's particular vision.  There's a million ways the same basic scenario could play out.  The dead are coming back to life and feeding on the living.  If they bite you...you will soon be a zombie.  Only way to kill you is to shoot or severely damage your head.  That's it.  How that idea would unspool for humanity is the fun of all this.  Romero brings to LAND OF THE DEAD a unique vision of the evolution of this scenario.  A lot of time has passed since NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the surviving humans have developed some pretty sophisticated survival techniques.  That's fun to watch.

But the zombies who remain have changed a bit themselves.  Their urges are the same...but now they actually have some semblance of organization.

It's fun to watch these two sides cope with the changes from the others.  For the zombies, they can't get at the humans with much ease anymore, and thus need to reinvent themselves.  For the humans, who now live in an insulated society (dominated by a crazy Dennis Hopper...ain't that perfect!), they must cope with the warring factions developing between themselves...a conflict which threatens to allow the zombies the room they need to reemerge from obscurity.

Some have said the movie is too slow or too hokey.  Or that the dialogue is bad.  Have you watched the other movies that you revere so much???  They have pretty bad dialogue too.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is 2 hours and 15 minutes, and many of the scenes of ""mall life"" drag on needlessly.  DAY OF THE DEAD is horrifically acted.  Yet we all love those.  And they are good, because the dialogue isn't really what we watch for.  It's the fascination with this primal conflict...and frankly, it's the gore.

LAND OF THE DEAD doesn't have the huge amounts of gore that DAY OF THE DEAD had, but there are some ""clever"" moments of gore, and naturally it's far more realistic when we see it.  And it also has a few actors who can act.  Simon Baker is a credible ""hero"" in my opinion, John Leguizamo always has a bit of charisma, even when he's sorta slumming, Dennis Hopper never fails to bring a smile to my face...cuz when he overacts, it's SO fun.  And even Asia Argento brings a nice feel to her cliched role.  It's time for her to have an actual ""role.""

Anyway,  I enjoyed the movie.  It's not a ""classic"" like the first two, and no, it doesn't have the outstanding flair of the recent DAWN remake (a movie I highly recommend), but it does offer familiar pleasures for fans of the genre.

Despite all the nay-saying, I still say ""yes.""",1121299200,,3725,4.5887708649468895

There is no hope for the human race. That's scary. Not letting the zombies walk away and saying, ""they're just trying to find a place too."" Okay.  The ending should have had a huge explosion, killing mostly everyone. There should be scenes of all around the world zombies eating people. Everyone is dead. zombies are all that is left. The human race is gone forever. Thats what the original 3 movies, especially my favorite, Night of the Living Dead, hinted at. Then, just so everyone knows that the world has come to an end, have an apocolyptic quote by edgar allan poe or lovecraft, or even romero could have made one himself. I'm sure he is capable of it. He's great at making movies with no hope.  You know, like ""the last days of earth hath come, there is no hope for humanity.

1554273,3,B00005JO16,"The question above is what I asked myself repeatedly while watching his latest zombie opus, ""Land of the Dead.""

Like the first two sequels to Romero's 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead,""  ""Land"" isn't so much a sequel as much as it is another view of a world overrun by walking, flesh-eating corpses.  The focus is on an unnamed, fortress-like city where the residents try to maintain some semblance of what life was like before the rise of the zombies.

Of course, in a perfect world ""Land of the Dead"" wouldn't even exist and Romero's zombie saga would have been brought to a fitting conclusion with 1985's ""Day of the Dead.""  That movie came on the heels of ""Night""'s masterpiece sequel, ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 1978.

For those who are not hardcore fans of Romero's original zombie trilogy here's the backstory:  ""Day of the Dead"" was supposed to have been Romero's magnum opus and last word on the zombie mythos.  As he originally conceived it, it would have been epic in scale and massive in execution.  Imagine for example, an Akira Kurosawa-type epic with flesh eating, walking corpses instead of samurai and you get a sense of what Romero was going for.

But it also would have been Romero's first zombie film produced through a major studio and that studio balked at Romero's independent film-making style, budget demands, and refusal to tone done the gore in order to achieve an ""R"" rating.  As a result, Romero scaled down his vision and produced ""Day"" on the same shoestring budget that had yielded the first two films.

Many considered the result a disappointment.  In my opinion, though it isn't as good as ""Night"" or ""Dawn,"" ""Day"" still stands as a solid, emotionally resonant piece of work that is a worthy installment in the series.  For the curious, the original shooting script of ""Day"" is widely available on many fan web sites.  It is well worth checking out not only to glimpse the film that could have been but also to view the various story elements that have now found their way into ""Land of the Dead.""

During the ensuing years, Romero himself even acknowledged that ""Day"" fell short and long talked about making a fourth film to bring the series to a more satisfying conclusion.  During this same period, the zombie genre has risen from the grave yielded new movies, comic books, and video games.

However, it appears that Romero wasn't so much flattered by this undead Renaissance as much as he was pissed off.  In an issue of ""Entertainment Weekly"" earlier this year, the director said, ""I kept wondering why no one was asking me to do one.""

Which leads us to ""Land of the Dead,"" a film that George Romero has apparently crafted to A) correct what some see as a past wrong and B) show the young whippersnappers in Hollywood how it's really done.

This would all be well and good if this was a better movie.  As it is, ""Land"" is a enjoyable but seriously compromised and flawed film.  It seems that in his zeal to get his own zombie movie made, Romero has now accepted many of the compromises he balked at years ago.

This movie has been produced through a major studio, Universal.  Unlike the first three movies, ""Land"" is also the first to feature Hollywood actors rather than mostly unknowns.  It is also the first to feature an ""R"" rating (""Dawn"" and ""Day"" in particular were so violent and gory Romero chose to have them be released unrated rather than slapped with an X rating.  NC-17 hadn't been created yet).

Even the film's title seems to be a concession to the studio suits.  The original title was ""Dead Reckoning"" which is the name of anti-zombie truck/tank that figures prominently in the film.  Given the themes explored in the movie, the original title is not only far more appropriate but it also just sounds cooler.  But you get the sense that some Universal executive probably told Romero, ""C'mon George.  The average moviegoer doesn't even know what the hell reckoning means.""

The film also falls down in the area of character development.  The first three films all boasted strong characters that you got to know and care about.  ""Land"" is far weaker effort in this regard.  While Simon Baker's Riley emerges as a standout most of the other characters serve no purpose other than to either move the plot along or be devoured by the ravenous zombies.  The casting of Asia Argento as the stereotypical ""Hooker With a Heart of Gold"" seems more like a stunt.  Hardcore fans of  ""Dawn"" know that Argento is the daughter of Dario Argento who helped produce the original ""Dawn"" as well as provided its musical score.  But aside from all that why is she here?

One tradition that Romero has maintained is casting a strong Black male character in the film.  But there's a twist here: This time he's a zombie.  And not just any zombie either.  Eugene Clark's ""Big Daddy"" is the leader of the army of zombies that ultimately storm the fortified city.

Clark's portrayal highlights the gradual transformation of the undead into more intelligent creatures that are increasingly able to use tools, plan attacks, and coordinate efforts.  Believe it or not, his performance is also the most powerful one in the film despite the fact that it is totally non-verbal except for screams, grunts, and snarls.  He also makes you root for a zombie for the first time since ""Day of the Dead""'s lovable Bub.

One other theme that is consistent with the original Dead trilogy is Romero's political subtext.  Any fan of Romero's movies knows that they're not just about horror.  They also have something to say.  ""Night""'s final scenes were a clear commentary on the state of American race relations in the late 1960s.  The shopping mall set ""Dawn"" was a commentary on the growing consumer culture of the late 1970s.  ""Day""'s politics are murkier but with its female lead surrounded by horny, pot-smoking soldiers and a mad scientist, none of whom respect her, it could be considered the first and last feminist zombie flick.

If ""Land"" is about anything it's about class warfare.  This struggle is represented here by three groups: There are the wealthy, suit wearing denizens of Fiddler's Green, the shopping mall/high rise palace whose residents are led by a slithery businessman named Kaufman played here by Dennis Hopper.  There are also the working poor, typified by Baker's Riley.  They live outside in the streets and tenements of the fortified city and exist mainly to serve the rich.  At the bottom of the heap are the zombies led by Clark's Big Daddy who stand across the river and gaze at the city and its residents not with envy but with infinite hunger.

In pre-production interviews, Romero talked about how ""Land"" would be about ""ignoring the problem.""  Watching the film, it's clear that the problem in question is homelessness.  The film really seems to be about how our society's refusal to seriously address the problems of the poor and homeless will ultimately come back to bite us in our ass just as the zombies in the movie literally do in the film's final quarter.

I have to give Romero props for trying to say something important through a zombie film.  But I also have to say that for the first time Romero's politics come across as heavy-handed, forced, and more than a little out of touch.  The beauty of the messages in the first three zombie films was that they came across subtly.  Here the message hits you like a zombie's teeth on your throat.

To answer the question, I posed at the beginning of this review I believe that Romero has indeed sold out here.  ""Land"" is a fun movie but it ultimately comes off as a piece of hackwork that is no more enjoyable than say ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse.""  That is to say that it's not a bad movie but it's also not a great one either.  The hard truth, and I believe many diehard Romero fans will agree, is that I wanted and hoped for more and just didn't get it.

The power of the original Dead films was that they showed us things we had never seen in a movie before.  Who can forget the first time they saw that guy's head get shotgunned to pieces in ""Dawn?""  Who can forget watching the mad Captain Rhodes in ""Day"" literally get his legs torn out from under him while screaming insanely ""Choke on em!  Choke on em!""

The problem with ""Land"" is that it gives us absolutely no moments that we haven't seen before, no moments where you're hit with the awesome rush of seeing a movie go all the way to the limit and then blast right past it at 100 m.p.h.

Films like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and last year's superb ""Dawn"" remake show that the zombie film genre still has some life left in it.  But I think maybe Romero should leave it to the young whippersnappers after all.",1120694400,4,8663,4.64257555847569

1554331,3,B00005JO16,"All three of the previous Romero ""Dead"" flicks offered something interesting and unique, and in this regard Land of the Dead succeeds.  A lot of interesting ideas are put onto the screen, but ultimately the movie doesn't end up being terribly memorable.  By no means is this a poor film, but it lacks dynamic and has more in common with the Dawn of the Dead remake than any of the original Romero films.  The characterization, so integral to the enjoyability of Night, Dawn, and Day, has been to some degree short-changed.  Dennis Hopper's tyrant is enjoyable enough, Asia Argento is tough enough, and Jason Riley is stolid enough, but the audience never really gets in under the proverbial skin of their characters.  Again, mediocre but not exceptional.  One could argue that humans are not the point of Romero's movies, zombies are, but that wouldn't be quite true: all the ""dead"" movies are about how the humans react to the rising of the dead, and characterization is essential.  The undead are quite good, and I liked how they united under the leadership of one exceptional zombie to invade the human compound.  The organization of the city was good, the class conflict handled reasonably well, the acting competant and the special effects/makeup superlative.  However, the lack of characterization coupled with a subpar ending (although in fairness ""Day's"" ending wasn't spectacular either) make this a two and a half star effort in opposed to a three.  **1/2",1120608000,,1465,4.967213114754099
1554332,4,B00005JO16,"The dead are mad as heck and aren't going to take it anymore! When we last caught up with George Romero's ""Dead"" films, ""Day of the Dead"" focused on the military trying to train the zombies for combat and experimenting on them. Romero takes the next step introduced into a world divided by the dead and the living each sharing space reluctantly with the other. That is until a gas station attendant zombie shows an inkling of intelligence and decides to go after the living in a sealed off skyscaper while those less fortunate live on the streets of the sealed off metropolis. Run by Kaufman (Dennis Hopper in perfect looney mode), the city is supplied by ""employees"" who can't live in the beautiful people's skyscraper. These scavengers led by Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo) pillage the landscape around them for essential items for the wealthy. Riley has a conscience decides he will no longer lead the crew of his ""tank"" Dead Reconkening and work for ""the man"" anymore. Cholo, on the other hand, keeps doing Kaufman's dirty work in hopes that he'll be able to buy his way into the wealthy paradise.

As usual Romero has lots of gore but, more importantly, there's a sly political and satricial message at the heart of the movie. Romero who has been an independent filmmaker his whole life probably identifies with Riley and thinks of the film studios as Kaufman and his denizens. It's a much broader metaphor though as it can be used to look at the disappearing middle class and the disintegration of the class system in America. It's a fun ride with some of Romero's most accomplished filmmaking. Working with a budget of around $20 million Romero manages to do the same kind of work as was seen in the remake of his ""Dawn of the Dead"" last year. Interestingly, the more films Romero makes in his ""Dead"" series (and this probably going to be the last or at least next to last because of his age), the more milage he gets out of the inspiration for the entire saga--Richard Matheson's novel ""I Am Legend"" which was turned into the low budget horror movie ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price (and the campy ""The Omega Man"" with Charleton Heston).

Outstanding effects are nicely off set with strong performances by the cast including Asia Argento (daughter of Romero friend and Italian horror film director Dario Argento) as a former hooker named Slack who is almost fed to the ""stenches"" (as the city inhabitants refer to the rotting zombies)in a bizarre scene that satrizies ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"". Romero hasn't lost his touch and although this doesn't have quite the revolutionary punch of ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Night of the Living Dead"" it's an improvement on ""Day of the Dead"" as well as most of the horror films out there.

The DVD has a very nice transfer and with the exception of an occasional bit of digital shimmer, the film looks as vibrant and alive as the bright red gushing blood. This is much more an action adventure movie than the previous films in the horror series and provides a nice bookend to the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (even if it isn't related). Sound is pretty lively with a nice 5.1 and DTS mix that will have you looking over your shoulders for the undead.

Extras include a lively commentary by ""Dead"" director Romero, producer Grunwald and editor Michael Doherty. There's also a number of featurettes on the making of the film but my personal favorite is ""When Shawn Met George"" about when Simon Pegg and Edgar White (star & writer and director * writer respectively) of the comedy/horror film ""Shawn of the Dead"" met Romero and appeared as extras in ""Land of the Dead"". We get to see how they're made into the undead and the first meeting between the three of them. ""Undead Again"" provides a glimpse into the making of the film. ""Green Screen to Finished Screen"" gives us before and after comparisons between the raw footage and the finished footage with optical effects. ""Storyboards and Final Scenes"" looks at the storyboards inserted as PIP with the finished product. ""Scream Tests"" opens with a very funny outtake featuring dancing zombies from the CGI footage for the film. ""Scenes of Carnage"" is pretty self explanatory. ""Bits and Pieces"" are scenes that were cut. Although none of the featurettes are quite as exhaustive as those provided as extras for the three disc set of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"". There's also some other extras including a behind-the-scenes ""A Day with the Living Dead"".

Could ""Dead"" have been more? Sure. There were some missed opportunities here regarding the life in the tower but then that would have been a completely different movie. Romero's done a terrific job given the limitations of time and budget.  Deftly balancing satire, horror and humanism, Romero makes one of his best films in years. I'm hoping this does well at the box office so that Romero can get financing to continue to examine the post-stench world a bit more. Oh and it's a Romero rarity with an ending that's actually more upbeat than I expected.",1120608000,129,5030,4.72976054732041
1554333,5,B00005JO16,"Finally i got to see Land of the dead while i was on holiday in florida and i wasn't disappointed as i was when i first watched resident evil. This film was much better than i imagined. George has finally been given the chance to make his zombie masterpiece and i was just blown away by it. It is dare i say it better than night, dawn and even day. The tension and action was non stop, the gore effects were top notch (eat your hearts out dawn of the dead remake and resident evil) The bodycount was the highest that i have ever seen in a dead movie. Lovely!

Riley, Charlie, Slack, Cholo and yes even Big Daddy were the best characters of any of the dead movies. (with the exveption of Bub of course!)

(Oh by the way for those who are trying to find the Shaun of the Dead boys aka Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's zombie cameos, just look very closly at the scene in the bar where slack is forced to fight two ravenous zombies. Just as the scene begins Two zombies are chained up and are being taunted by the inhabitants. One is chained up for posers to get pictures taken with him. Who does he look like? That's right simon is Bub. Edgar is on thr right of him snarling at passers-by. Still speaking about the zombies, i love the fact that george has still kept the sentimentality that Bub had in the Day of the dead and this time used it for the main zombie character Big daddy. Whenever one of his clan is brutally massacred he lets out a mournful cry and you do feel sorry for him. But then you realise that they eat human flesh and it kind of subsides. He even kills his own kind as well just to put them out of their misery if mutilation occurs. I.e one is set on fire and Big Daddy shoots him in the head to end his suffering. Also the fact that they are dead smarter than they used to be is genuinely terrifying. They can even use weapons and even break through electric fences which maximises the tension and fear. But really the zombies are more like the anti-heroes of this film. Sure they can tear a man or woman apart within 15 seconds but george shows us that they have a purpose. Big Daddy's main objective is to get revenge on those who have ridiculed him and his clan while they were alive, the goverment and the filthy rich. That is why he leads the siege on fiddlers green, to feast on those who i thought deserved to be devoured. The ones who frown on the other human race just because they have more money than them. The attack on the mall was brilliant. I have been waiting for a scene like that since dawn of the dead and george gave me my wish. Thank you G.

And some people did not like the ending? Why didn't they like it? Come on you should know by now that george has always considered zombies as humans and not just gut munchers. I did feel like riley as the filmed ended, why should they die, they are us after all. What good would it have done? The dead will always roam the earth and nobody can stop them all.

One gripe that i did have was the fact that i found kaufman's death unsatisfactory. Why didn't he get a Rhodes style death with Big Daddy and A famous zombie tearing him apart Hey come on the guy deserved it don't you think?

But all in all Land of the Dead is a five star grade A horror, made only the way that George knows how to do it.....gory as hell. I can't wait to see it again when it gets relased in england. and even the uncut DVD. That i really look forward to.",1120608000,,3414,4.135542168674699
1554334,3,B00005JO16,"A truely mediocre film, Land of the Dead begs the question, ""Can you have your brain and eat it too?"" The latest from horror master George A. Romero portrays a world not unlike our own, where ignorant yuppies live off the suffering of the indigent. The confine themselves to Fiddler's Green where they can live out a life of leisure despite the torments of the outer world. The Green is led by a corrupt business official played by Dennis Hopper. Hopper succeeds bringing life to a lifeless character, but the shining sky flower of this film is Big Daddy.

The political satire is not exactly bold. Land of the Dead is not as intelligent as Romero's Dawn of the Dead, nor is it as horrifying as Night of the Living Dead. The film, however, does bring the familiar creatures out of familiar territory. The protagonist in this film is a zombie. Big Daddy, despite being living impaired, developes intelligence and even emotion. He views the massacre of his colleagues and leads them to liberty. He's a sort of William Wallace of the dead.

Romero's talent has always lied in dimming the line between man and monster, and in that respect, this is his masterpiece. Unfortunately, Land of the Dead abandons its satire for cheap action and gratuitous gore. It ultimately falls into the same group of mundane horror films that have been polluting theaters throughout recent years.",1120521600,7,1373,4.789029535864979

The film really is quite funny seeing the zombies try to adapt to our way of life. From the first scene when they are trying to play instruments to when they figure out how to use guns..it really is amusing and enjoyable.

1554338,4,B00005JO16,"I found this thoroughly enjoyable, but there's something bothering me, something that no one else seems to have noticed. Land of the Dead is the third sequel to Night of the Living Dead, in which a problem with a satellite caused corpses to come to life and set out on murderous rampages. That was in 1968, and this movie acknowledges that in its prologue by showing an old Zenith radio broadcasting the bad news. So why does everything in this movie, which takes place in the present, look so modern? The vehicles. The technology on Dead Reckoning. The commercial for Fiddler's Green. The clothing. That all looked pretty modern to me, no older than the 1990s. So since 1968, the human race has been busy fighting off zombies, usually while fighting amongst themselves, but the technology, automotive and fashion industries continued with their work, coming out with new models, gadgets and attire, including outfits for the modern prostitute, that could be displayed in stores and showrooms in the wasteland of walking zombies.

Also, another logical problem is the way in which zombies multiply. If they eat their victims, how does that make more zombies? I can understand how it works with one like Cholo, who gets bitten, gets away, then later changes. But all these other ones? Did all of them just get bitten, escape to someplace safe, then change and join the pack? And some of the zombies look to be severely decayed, while others, like Big Daddy, just look like NFL players in a steroid rage. Are those rotting ones the ones that got up out of their graves in 1968, and they've been that way ever since? Or do they all rot eventually? And what about all those dead bodies that were buried in cemeteries prior to 1968? Have they all been in their caskets, six feet undergroud, clamoring to get out for 37 years? Would a zombie eventually rot away and return to dust? Can a skeleton get up and walk, maybe even dance like in the old Disney cartoon?

I hope someone out there can enlighten me. Or maybe it's best just not to think about it.",1120435200,2,2047,4.651933701657459
1554339,4,B00005JO16,"It's been quite a while since horror visionary George Romero last graced horror fans with a film, and it's been 20 years since his last ""Dead"" film, 1985's terribly underrated Day of the Dead.  But now, with the recent success of more mainstream aimed zombie flicks like 28 Days Later, the Resident Evil films, the excellent spoof Shaun of the Dead, and even the big budget remake of Romero's own Dawn of the Dead, the climate has never been better for the zombie horror master to show us all how a zombie movie is really done.  For the most part, Land of the Dead is a thoroughly enjoyable horror romp that despite it's R rating, still provides the gut ripping gore that Romero fans would come to expect.  The story involves a team of mercenaries led by Riley (Simon Baker), who are employed by a millionaire socialite (Dennis Hopper) in this post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland where the remaining humans are barricaded from the hordes of hungry undead outside.  However, the zombies seem to be communicating and learning on a primative level, and are led by the hulking ""Big Daddy"" (Eugene Clark).  Things get even more complicated when the rightfully disatisfied, and ever politically uncorrect named, Cholo (John Leguizamo) ransoms the tank like vehicle ""Dead Reckoning"" (which was Romero's original title of the film) as the zombies close in for the kill.  While there had to be cuts in order for Land of the Dead to sustain it's R rating, there is still plenty of gruesome deaths and excellently designed makeup, courtesy of Greg Nicotero and co.  The cast does solid work, led by Baker, Leguizamo, and Hopper, along with Robert Joy as Riley's dim witted but faithful follower, and Asia Argento as a sometimes hooker who joins up with Riley's crew.  What hurts Land of the Dead the most is that Romero goes for the ""cheap scare"" routine more here than he ever did before in any of his other films.  Not to mention that there are a nice amount of plot holes, and the lack of character development (something which helped make the original Dawn of the Dead such a masterpiece) is quite lacking.  In the end though, Land of the Dead is pretty much everything that a Romero fan could hope for, and with cameos from Nicotero, FX legend Tom Savini, and Shaun of the Dead star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, this is a horror fan's delight.",1120262400,,2344,4.695121951219512

This movie consists of bad acting, screenwriting, and plot. For all the people who have seen this movie and actually liked it i feel very sorry for you. The first three films of his are EXTREMLEY better in terms of everything.

The story:

The story takes place after the awakening of zombies. There is a gang of people who get supplies for the town and go on zombie killing sprees. One of the members gets fed up and takes ""Dead Reckoning"" and...who cares? The basic plot is pretty stupid and makes you wonder what some of the other ideas Romero had.

The ""Goods""

There wasn't alot of goods things in land but here they are.

-John Leguizamo, he was the only good actor, the rest of the actors were boring and annoying.

-Zombies, the zombies were pretty cool and the scene where they rise from the water is sweet.

The ""Bad""

-Plot, The whole story is pretty lame

-Acting, As i said before most of the main actors were very boring or just plain dumb.

-Violence, Some of the blood and gore was pretty cool and gruesome but in this day and age Romero could of went completly overboard with the gore but i have no idea why he didn't.

-Pacing, This movie is only about 90 minutes and you can't get into the story or characters at all. You're just left with this feeling like ""Why should we Care?""

-Suspense, There is no suspense at all in this movie, with no good characters or good gore scenes there's no leverage or transition to the next climatic scene.

-Ending, The ending is pretty abrubt but by the end i already thought there was a million flaws in the movie, i really didn't care.

With those thoughts in mind i hope you choose to rent some good zombie movies and avoid this crap. Shame on you, Romero with more time you could of come up with something terrifying and original.",1120262400,2,1913,4.413105413105413
1554416,4,B00005JO16,"The fourth installment in George A. Romero's acclaimed series of zombie movies does not dissapoint by any means.  He manages to again mix in stark social commentary (Rich vs. Poor), a real sense of desperation in the story, and sheer shock value (there were several points where the entire audience was almost universally grossed out).

The plot centers around Riley and Cholo, mercs who work for Kaufman, the distasteful head of Fiddler's Green, a luxurious community in one of the last strongholds of the living.  Riley and Cholo are polar opposites, who share one common thread.  They are both on thier last supply mission for Kaufman.  Riley dreams of driving to the largely unpopulated Canadian plains and setting up a new life there.  Cholo dreams of buying a place in Fiddler's Green.  Both have the means to do so, but cannot due to complications in thier plans.  Thier setbacks are less important than the main problem.  The zombies are beginning to assume the roles of thier past lives, almost as if they are not entirely dead inside.  They are also learning rudimentary communication.  When one of them begins to head toward the city, the others follow instinctively.  Soon, the city has an army of zombies heading toward it, which is especially rough because Cholo steals Kaufman's 'Dead Reckoning', essentially a zombie-proof tank.  I will not give away any more of the plot, but some really intense action follows.  My only complaint is that the movie is over too soon.  It seems like it could have gone on for much longer.

The Final Word - This is a classic Romero zombie movie that lives up to the rest of the series.  Not for those with a weak stomach, but it delivers where I expected it to.  Recommended to everyone except children (it will give them nightmares).  I just hope that I don't have to wait another twenty years for the next installment.",1120089600,,1869,4.766355140186916

Good story line regarding the fortified city, ""Dead Reckoning"", the ""spark"" of intelligence and communication/ cooperation among the zombies.

It felt like somebody trying to imitate Romero's style.... maybe just because it has been so many years since Romero did a film like this.

Oddly enough, even though it was a comedy and spoof, I feel last year's SHAUN OF THE DEAD actually captured the Romero feel better.

I actually give LAND 3.5 stars because even though they did a good job showing the evolution and advancement of the problem, it did not quite ""come together"".

There was never really a feeling of impending doom like in the other ""Romero Zombie Trilogy""...... this one had more of a typical Hollywood feel to it.

At least I am glad to see the Zombies the way they are supposed to be....slow lumbering masses... and not the olympic runners oj steroids moving as fast as lightening in recent films.

The creepiness of Zombies comes from the fact that even though they move slowly, the growing numbers will overwhelm you eventually... that's the ""creeping death"" and is much scarier than a supposed Zombie that moves like a Mountain lion ....geezzzz.

Question........ What happened to the TWILIGHT OF THE DEAD script Romero wanted to shoot for years ?

This movie LAND OF THE DEAD (Dead Reckoning) is NOT that ame story from what I gather.

Good to see George back.

LAND was better than the other attempts out there, but despite the budget, big studio distribution, etc....  it did not quite have the same ""magic"" as the first 3.",1120089600,,1679,4.538205980066445
1554419,4,B00005JO16,"So a little tired of the these new zombies, they're fast and a lot more lethal than the Zombies of old. Well if you are you are not alone, at least theres me that I know of. Any way, Romero once again graces us with his social commentary in gory, and violent form, Land Of The Dead, which I am going to assume is the last in Romero's Dead chapters.

Ultimately the underlining theme that's going to slap you in the face is, who is more important? The few on top or the many on the bottom, the ""unwashed masses,"" if you will, because often in the face of poverty and restrictions due to money, we all in fact have most of the power, we are the foundation that supports the power structure and with a little tampering everything can be shifted. A little Marxist for you, well its true.

One other thing that I noticed, was the existence of money as a controlling factor, the fact that 90% of the world's pop. is out walking around trying to the flesh of the living, the apacalypse in other words, still didn't stop the existence and need for monetary gain in Land. Course it took the ultimate adventure capitalist, Kaufman (Hopper), whom I'm going to assume lives for nothing more than monetary value had a rather large in this, but still he was allowed to dictate a desire and need for cash.

Other than that, with each Romero Dead film we are assaulted with more and more gore to feast our eyes upon, I however could have done without so much of it.

So Romero brought us thinking Zombies, which I found to be more than a little Kubrick inspired albiet without a symphony orchestra and great black pilliars however. Not to mention another inovation to whole Zombie sub-genre, the Zombie with a heart of gold, which I just think sounds so much more catchy than the Compassionate Zombie.

And what happened to the day analogies Romero? Night, Dawn and Day. Course I guess you ran out of times, couldn't very well have Mid Afternoon of the Dead, or Early Evening of the Dead, High Noon of the Dead (a zombie western) or Brunch of the Dead, no they just don't seem to have the ring of other three predecessors. And Land just means that the end has come full circle. If you ask me.

Anyway hope this review helped, hope you enjoy. If you don't just write about and then tell me how wrong I was.",1120089600,,2289,4.36150234741784
1554420,4,B00005JO16,"Kaufman (Hopper) is a very wealthy man who owns a high-rise in zombie-free Pittsburgh called Fiddler's Green.  All the privlidged live there, while the rest live on the streets.  Riley (Baker) and Cholo (Leguizamo) are two of Kaufman's henchmen.  Their job is to journey outside the city and bring supplies back while avoiding the zombies.  They are two sides of the same coin, Riley wants to help people and Cholo wants to help himself.  Both manage to anger Kaufman though.  Riley saves a woman (Argento) from being thrown to the zombies, and Cholo's ambition marks him as a threat to Kaufman.

Cholo steals Dead Reconing, a armored vehicle capable of doing some serious damage in the wrong hands, and Kaufman must ask Riley for help.  After all, Riley created Dead Reconing.  This involves leaving the city again to find Cholo.  Of course the zombies are not helpful as they stalk the living and find out that perhaps thay can get into the city after all.  All to this the beginnings of thought abongst the undead, and there is a whole lot of trouble brewing.

This is the fourth zombie movie from George A. Romero, creater of ""Night of the Living Dead"".  Those with a fondness for zombie movies will not be disappointed, although I found it inferior to last year's ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake.  There are lots of zombies and clever deaths, and the story takes us down a somewhat new path in the zombie genre.  Dennis Hopper is great as the Trump-lik Kaufman, and he steals every scene that he is in.  The rest of the cast gets the job done, but they are nothing spectacular.

""Land of the Dead"" gives you exactly what you would expect, and perhaps a bit more.  There is some commentary on the world today, but not enough to interfere with a good old fashioned zombie movie.  I recommend to fans of the genre.",1120089600,,1810,4.582554517133956
1554421,5,B00005JO16,"Legendary filmmaker George A. Romero returns to the sub-genre that he reinvented some 30+ years ago. Things aren't the same this time around. This time he had a decent budget to work with, a big name studio behind him, and a few recognizable stars, but the outcome is just as good. Even though LOTD had a decent sized budget, Mr. Romero still stayed clear of making the same mistakes that other filmmakers that attempted this sub-genre have made. Instead of filling it full of CGI, he used a small amount, instead of focusing more on a soundtrack full of Top 40 hits he relied on scores, and instead of blowing the whole budget on action scenes and explosions filled with Matrix style effects he chose to use old fashion action scenes only when they were approtiate. I've heard alot of reviews for this film and it seems the opinions are a bit mixed. The ones that didn't like it much claimed that they were no plot. I assume they just missed it because the plot was there and it was a rather deep one. I won't go into the plot because it would be hard to do w/o spoiling something. I will say this, if you are expecting a movie with the right amount of character development, political commentary, and gore this is the movie to get it. If you are looking for tons of fast paced, Matrix style action with alot of young good looking kids from your favorite WB show, look elsewhere.",1120089600,,1380,4.437007874015748
1554422,3,B00005JO16,"I'm a late comer to director George Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy of horror films, and by the time I caught up, I inadvertently watched from third film to first. This didn't stop me from recognizing classics and snatching them up on DVD.

So when tribute films and special editions sets churned out a couple years ago, my hunger for brains returned. Zack Snyder's *Dawn of the Dead* amused me, but it strayed significantly from Romero's universe. Snyder's version also downplayed the gore and characterizations of the original. Then Edgar Wright's wonderful *Shaun of the Dead* mixed situational comedy with straight horror and social commentary; but it too stands as its own film. Yet, when I heard George Romero went ahead and with a fourth film, the news seemed anticlimactic; Perhaps because it was to be distributed by a mainstream studio, perhaps because twenty years passed since *Day of the Dead*.

We've finally arrived at *Land of the Dead*. But far from a finale, Romero's latest account of his zombie apocalypse plays like a new generation. It's a sequel and a retread all at the same time, and while it isn't as good as films in the trilogy, it still maintains the tradition.

Romero reasserts his legacy from the opening credits. Soundbites remind us that anybody who dies rises undead, not just zombie victims. It repeats the edict that the brain must be destroyed in order to kill the living dead--even severed heads can bite. From the opening scene, *LotD* remains true to the logic that reanimated dead are too stiff and decayed to screech and leap about. The film even stays mostly true to the timeline-though title cards tell us *LotD* takes place ""today"", it reflects a world conquered by zombies back in *Day*. Occasionally a PDA or a G36 rifle shows up, but for the most part tools date prior to 1985.

So does the action. *LotD* boasts the only big budget in the entire series. This helped administer heaping doses of CGI. But much of the film looks and sounds like *Escape from New York* meets *The Road Warrior*. John Leguizamo's character ""Cholo"" in particular dresses and acts like the love child of Snake Plissken and Mad Max-not that this is a bad thing. Nor is the massive attack truck, which would make every eighties apocalypse movie envious as it steams over zombies like a train. As these zombies roamed the roads of Pittsburgh, I kept expecting Kurt Russell to land on a skyscraper and help Mel Gibson repel the Assault on Precinct 13.

1980 extends to cinematography and soundtrack. The M16A1s and eighties hairdos make sense, so I guess the cheesy, low budget action film music makes sense. Again, aside from numerous CGI sequences, the cuts and camera angles look like those from the days before steady cams and computer-controlled tracking.

After overdosing on Lord of the Ring and Star Wars extravaganzas, watching this throwback filmmaking seems like tasting an old family recipe for the first time in years-kind of disorienting, but kind of warm. This theatrical mix could have used some more time in the oven though. Land of the Dead's big flaw seems to be some severe editing-not just of gore, but also storytelling.

The film tears apart superficial characters almost as quickly as it throws them up on screen. And I'm not talking about the crowds of zombie fodder-there's at least thirty major and minor characters who play pivotal roles with all the camera exposure of an extra. It confuses me trying to keep track of a platoon of people who hardly spend five seconds on camera at any given scene. Itt becomes more confusing when irrelevant characters are suddenly introduced halfway through the film, taking up attention and screen time better spent getting audiences to the climax. Considering this film lasts only 93 minutes, I can think of five or six characters off the top of my head to excise for clarity.

This matters: *Land* isn't just a zombie film-it's a George Romero zombie film and it can do better. *Day of the Dead* wasn't much longer than *Land*, but the former film balanced the pace, performances, and plot to make a satisfying experience on a fraction of the budget and a quarter of the cast. And while most *Dead* films have technically happy endings, *Land* is the only volume ending on a weak note.

So no, it is not the kick-ass greatness of the Trilogy, at least in this form. But *LotD* can still gobble intestines pretty good. Most dismemberment happens off-camera, and most of the violence happens at night so the blood looks black, but its as hard an ""R"" as they come. Decapitations, eviscerations, crushing, bludgeoning, spearguns, even paintguns-all kinds of stuff. And Romero doesn't hesitate to kill sympathetic characters, their screams filling the air.

For what little time we see them, the actors also fill the screen. Dennis Hopper always delights me, and here he satirizes President Bush without insult or exaggeration. John Leguizamo in turn satirizes Osama bin Laden; again without clowning. Both actors demonstrate the sincerity of scoundrels, as Leguziamo smolders with revenge and Hopper quivers with indignation. Tom Savini cameos towards the end in a satisfyingly ironic reprise of his role in *Dawn*. Indeed, the cast is a who's-who of horror movie heroes and their relatives.

I guess that's one more reason why *Land* feels like a retread. It logically follows from *Day*, in which scientists discover some zombies can be trained to remember their former roles as humans. Now zombies seem to be learning on their own. Humanity faces an armed and guided force, albeit more mindless and disorganized than the zombie force in *Army of Darkness*. *Land* is also much more action-oriented, with the trademark tension of the series reduce to more conventional jump scenes. It even adopts conventional horror language, referring to the zombie process as ""turning"", like some sort of vampire movie. This doesn't bother me, but diehard Dead fans should be warned.

Be warned, and be entertained. While *Land of the Dead* suffers from too much crammed in too little time, it maintains the integrity of Romero's previous Living Dead films. The sheeted dead return: squeaking and gibbering as Romero knows how.",1120003200,2,6191,4.9423076923076925

1554424,2,B00005JO16,"""Land of the Dead"" is, in terms of M-TV/CGI-era action-horror schlock, actually a pretty effective movie.  Romero shows enough skill in framing and lensing to prove that he hasn't lost his cinematic chops and, in certain broad terms, the economy of storytelling here shows a sense of craft that would be appreciated in a direct-to-dvd feature.  Unfortunately, this is the Romero who gave us ""Night"", ""Dawn"", and ""Day of the Dead"", making expectations much higher, and thus I can only hope that Universal studios has pulled a Kaufmann-like trick on our auteur-hero, forcing him to avenge himself with a much longer, unrated DVD director's cut!

  Yet it's still hard to imagine ""Land of the Dead"" resurrecting itself into a classic.  Sure, the cinematography is creative, almost gorgeous at times (there's one astoundingly lovely and menacing shot, through fog-enshrouded forest, of the zombies milling about on their grim errands as our heroes come to a stop in the middle of the road) and naturally there's plenty of creative gore.  Romero riffs a bit on ""Apocalypse Now"" with the zombies rising epiphanically from the river, and there's some grim pathos when the zombies finally show up at the lobby doors of Fiddler's Green, followed by what is perhaps a too-humorous meelee, making meals of the wannabe-Hiltons (the film's most expressive gag comes when a zombie bites out some faceless extra's navel ring, apparently one of those blinged-out Britney style ornaments.  The resultant pool of blood somehow has a more horrific texture, being a surface wound, than all the astounding disembowellments) But it's shocking how underdeveloped much of the film feels, more like ""The Running Man"" or (more flatteringly) Carpenter's ""Escape from . . ."" films than the Living Dead trilogy.  Romero's political subtext is seriously hampered by the fact that he's stuck with two oppressed subclasses, poor city-dwelling humans and the zombies, and when he shunts over the feasting on the slum-dwellers to get on to the banqueting at the high-rise, it feels like the wrong kind of political correctness.  This problem really bites hard at the wrap-up, when Dead Reckoning's missles apparently incinerate the feasted-on wealthy and their vindictive diners, only to liberate a mass of the huddled poor.  How long they have to enjoy their freedom is anyone's guess-- and this points up the problem with Romero's attempt to relativize zombies and humans.  Even Anne Rice can't totally romanticize the vampire's amoral thirst for blood, so why should Romero romanticize his zombies, especially if they're not listening to Beethoven? . . .

  Still, one can hope that a longer cut would add dimension, pathos, and fear to a film that is, in this incarnation, entirely too barebones.  The opening credits, with their frenzied montage of dissolving titles, desperate soundbytes and biting zombies, strike the appropriate note of apocalypticism, reinforced by those white-on-black fireworks in a godless night sky.  But the poetry is quickly replaced with lacklustre actioneering.  Let's hope Romero can untangle something more shapely and disturbing from this quickie miasma.",1120003200,3,3157,5.26746506986028

Land of the Dead (George A. Romero, 2005)

I'm not saying not to go see this movie. As a film that stands on its own, it's not a bad little thing, though it probably would have gone straight to video these days. Do you really need a plot synopsis? Stuff blows up. Lots of gory special effects get slung around. A rip-roaring, intestine-chewing good time is had by all. And yes, it is, in fact, a good time.

But this is Romero. And this is the film that Romero has been wanting to make for two decades. It's reasonable to expect more than that. And it's not here. Unfortunately, it's quite difficult to say why that is without major spoilers as examples, but the majority of the film's great flaws, and they are great, have to do with continuity problems. Yes, I know I sound like an obsessed Trekkie when I say this, but I'm not talking about the guy with the red shirt on dying in Season 3 Episode 2 and showing up again with a hefty promotion in Season 5 Episode 6. I'm talking about the major development at the start of the movie, the big twist on which all other spoilers hang, having originally happened halfway through Night of the Living Dead. I spent the movie's next eighty minutes wondering how Romero could have managed to overlook that very basic fact, upon which the whole movie turns?

As well, it's an ninety-three minutes long. It's not only the shortest film in the zombie quartet, but it's the second-shortest film Romero has ever made. I'd like to put it down to an exceptionally tight production schedule, I really would, because it seems so many of the movie's actors wouldn't have been utterly wasted in their roles given a longer running time. The two leads, Riley (Simon Baker, recently of The Ring Two) and Cholo (John Leguizamo of Spawn and To Wong Foo fame), are decently-drawn characters, though neither has the depth of character that categorized the major players in the earlier zombie films. Everyone else in the film, including female lead Asia (Scarlet Diva, b. Monkey) Argento, is utterly wasted. Again, about what you'd expect from a B-grade action horror comedy, and forgivable in the hands of most directors of such fare. But this is the guy who gave us some of the most enduring characters in horror film history. Why skimp now?

Then there are the effects. I expected tameness when the film received an R rating, and I got it (though it should be noted that if you're watching closely enough, you'll see a ""greatest hits"" pastiche of deaths from the other films in the series throughout, which is numbly depressing on so many levels we won't even go there). What I didn't expect was that the zombie makeup that has characterized the zombies in Romero's films would have completely changed. The trademark blue-tinged zombie skin has disappeared completely.  The zombies in Land of the Dead are not nearly as unhuman, as they are in the series' first three films. This points to what may be the movie's greatest structural defect-- the lack of subtext. Romero's zombie films remain cinematic classics because they're not about the zombies, they're about the humans, and the underlying human condition. Each of the first three films in the series is so loaded with sociopolitical subtext that, looking back at them, I wonder how I missed it in my first go-round with each. I think it may be because those zombies are so alien. Romero had to work that much harder to get the subtext to work, and despite that, it's never delivered with the mallet-like cloddishness that is so rife in Hollywood message movies; they are nothing if not subtle most of the time. I'm not sure whether the more lifelike zombies were an attempt to not have to work that hard, but somewhere in the mix, the sociopolitical subtext took so much of a back seat that it was almost dropped. Sure, there are the haves and the have-nots in the human stronghold, and you could put together a small article on how the disparity between the two groups mirrors the same growing disparity in American culture today. But it would be a small article, and one that not many people would disagree with; it certainly won't inspire hours, if not days, of debate, like the earlier films, Dawn especially, did.

But perhaps the most telling detail of how far the mighty have fallen I have saved for last, and I have to go back into obsessed-Trekkie mode, so take with whatever salt necessary. Kaufman, the head of the stronghold's ""have"" contingent, actually calls the walking dead ""zombies"" in this film-- the first time the word ""zombie"" has been used in the entire series. (This conceit is so much a part of the original three films, in fact, that Pegg and Wright used it as a semi-running gag in the wonderful Shaun of the Dead.) If you see that as a desecration, I have to warn you away from this movie. If you can shut your brain off and forget, for an hour and a half, that this was supposed to be the closing masterpiece in what is, arguably, the finest series of horror films ever made, then give it a go. **1/2",1119916800,3,5106,4.622932745314222
1554499,1,B00005JO16,"I rarely walk out of a movie theater. I walked out of ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" and I walked out of ""Land of the Dead.""

""Land of the Dead"" is just like every other zombie flick you've seen. I watched 30 minutes of absolutely nothing new. There is a twist to this movie with the zombies starting to communicate, but that doesn't make up for an idiotic script, flat characters, or bad make-up.

Script
You know when bad things are going to happen in ""Land of the Dead"" because they happen when they do in every other zombie film. When the young kid is told to blindly reach over a counter and ""pick those up"" when all other characters leave the drug store in the middle of zombie town, you know the young kid is going to get attacked.

Characters
John Leguizamo's cussing in Spanish left a bad taste in my mouth; that ""the man,"" Dennis Hopper, treats Leguizamo no better than a hired hand, unworthy of living in Fiddler's Green, made me want to throw things at the screen. Finally, there is a man speaking out against Fiddler's Green as something that was taken away from the people; he speaks with an Irish accent and I don't think that's coincidence (Fiddler's Green and he's Irish? I'm not sure what that means, but it's certainly odd...). All the characters are so flat that you already know how they're going to deliever the lines and even what they are going to say. The fact that the characters are stereotyped and even mildly racist makes this film even worse because you don't care about the dynamics between these characters.

Make-up
We all *know* it's make-up, but we want to suspend our disbelief. This film doesn't give us that luxury, instead trying to gross the audience out with pathetic effects (heads exploding, you've never seen so many as within the first 20 minutes) and seemingly new zombie manifestations (yes, there's a zombie cheerleader in this film, too, that's not original). That there's more attention paid to how creatures would look after several weeks of being ""undead"" is a sad attempt to take our minds off the other problems with the film. Trouble is, that attention is poorly executed, resulting in zombies that look only halfway finished in the zombification make-up process. Go back to wardrobe, guys! You need to get some finishing touches before you're on film!

Go rent the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" or even the inferior 1979 ""Dawn of the Dead."" Even ""Return of the Living Dead,"" a campy 1985 update of the genre, is better than ""Land of the Dead."" At best, if there's nothing else on the shelves, zombies are staggering through the door, and you need to make a quick selection before you're eaten, you might rent ""Land of the Dead."" Even then, I'd say you're better off with a bag of popcorn watching zombies explode when the guy on top of the building next door shoots for target practice.

Say what you like about the misunderstood horror genre, ""Land of the Dead"" is an absolutely monumental release. Too bad the movie's only ""ok"" instead of ""totally awesome.""

Working with a much larger budget than he's normally accustomed to, George Romero returns to the genre he invented with Land of the Dead, a smart-ish tale of human greed, gory action, and zombie apocalypse.

So it was with much excitement and a healthy dose of Romero worship that I sat down to experience Land of the Dead, the fourth chapter in a series that includes true-blue classics like Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, as well as the reasonably admired Day of the Dead. I tried to keep my expectations at a rational level, but come the f on! This is George Romero doing another ZOMBIE movie! For a full-fledged horror fanatic (such as yours truly) there's just not much that's bigger than this.

Cutting right to the chase: Land of the Dead works, and at times it works amazingly well -- but it's no classic, and I seriously doubt it will ever be considered one.

Land of the Dead rockets by at an amazingly brisk clip; a whole lot of plot background is told in an semi-efficient whiplash paced fashion, and the numerous characters are introduced in fine form. But it seems that while the set-up was given extra care and attention -- it came at noticeable expense to the second and third acts.

But I'm getting ahead of myself here.

As the movie opens we learn that pretty much all of our planet has been overrun by the cannibalistic undead. Apparently there are still a few isolated pockets of humanity still remaining -- although I use the word ""humanity"" lightly. One such outpost of human survival is Fiddler's Green, a gleaming tower that lords over the rotting husk of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Scattered throughout the urban sprawl beneath the tower's shadow are the dregs of humanity, the undesirables and the poverty-stricken. And inside the shiny skyscraper are the rich, the powerful, and the spoiled rotten. The man in charge of this arrangement is a guy called Kaufman, and all you need to know about Mr. Kaufman is that he's played by Dennis Hopper at his most amazingly evil.

Kaufman has a cadre of blue-collar grunt-workers under his thumb, and it's these folks who do all of the dirty work. But when Kaufman decides to play the elitist card to the wrong henchman ... well, let's just say it's the first step in a series of mishaps that ultimately lead to (all together now) zombie invasion!

Romero slaps his fourth chapter together from a variety of colorful sources: plot-wise, much of Land of the Dead feels like a remake of John Carpenter's Escape from New York. The social commentary, of which there is plenty, focuses on the wide gap that exists between the haves and the have-nots, only here it's broadened into a metaphor that involves the frequent chomping of human flesh.

Regarding the people-eaters, Mr. Romero has decided to bump his zombies up one level on the evolutionary scale. After spending so many years as mindless eating machines, the shuffling corpses have slowly become able to think -- and the first thing that occurs to a creature after being able to reason? Why, the insatiable desire to wreak vengeance upon those who've been nasty, of course!

But this is where the problem comes in, and while it's a relatively minor one, it's something that nagged me through the entire final hour of Land of the Dead. This is a movie in an awful hurry to hit those end credits. I'd bet a bag of money that there's at least 25 minutes of character development, subplot threads, and story payoffs that didn't make it into the final cut. Not only is our first glimpse inside the world of Fiddler's Green entirely rushed, but Land of the Dead makes it a point to introduce several fascinating characters ... only to end up giving them practically nothing to do. There's a butt-kicking femme fatale anti-heroine, a scar-faced sidekick, a goofily likable and massive Samoan solider, and several random henchmen -- very few of whom are allowed to do anything even remotely interesting.

There's a point about 70 minutes into Land of the Dead where the movie seems ready to rocket forward on all cylinders, and instead it just sort of ... wanders off into the distance. Just as the movie seems to be rolling towards a massive finale, Land of the Dead trickles to an end with all the inertia of deflated beach ball. Frankly it seems like Romero was asked to snip scene X and scene Y ... but in order to do that he also had to cut scenes R, S, T, and U. It's a somewhat disconcerting way for such a devilishly entertaining movie to finish up, but I suppose this gripe is similar to complaining that ""this rather delicious steak is simply too darn small."" Needless to say, I look forward to the Unrated Director's Cut on DVD -- which you just know is bound to happen.

But all things considered, it's just great to see Mr. Romero hop back on to the zombie bandwagon that he created back in 1968. ""Land of the Dead"" has more jolts, more gore, more (tired) subtext, and more bullets to the head than just about any ""studio"" horror flick you'll ever see, and I applaud Universal for giving the hero of horror a chance to bring this latest chapter to the screen. This one might not live up to the standard set by ""Dawn of the Dead,"" but ... WTF. Did you really think it would?",1119830400,,5577,4.622222222222222
1554504,1,B00005JO16,"First off I am a GIANT George Romero fan and I absolutely love the previous DEAD movies. My favorites (in order) would be Day of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead (1990 remake), Dawn of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead (2004 remake), Night of the Living Dead (original).

I have seen the entire zombie collection of Romero and Romero inspired movies and therefore my expectations for this movie where very high. NOBODY does zombie movies like Romero and nobody ever will. Land of the Dead falls shy of the incredible movie making that Romero is known for. The previous DEAD movies, although all different, had one thing in common; a zombie movie with an intricate plotline, elaborate character development, and scathing social commentary. This movie has none of the above.

Considering Romero's previous works, Land of The Dead has no foundation of story line, plot or characters. There is nothing that endears us to the characters and therefore there is nothing endearing about this movie. Because we don't know anything about the characters the audience never empathizes with the `good' guys - or roots against the `bad' guys. The previous Romero movies ALWAYS centered on the characters and the social commentary- the zombies and gore were just cool extras. This movie is focused on looking cool rather than delivering a movie of substance.

The basic premise of this movie is some `smart' zombies attack a secure city. Why are the zombies smart? Don't know ( we have to assume that all of these zombies got independently smart like Bub in Day of the Dead I guess).  Why are there people in a skyscraper? Don't know. The `villain' (poorly played by Dennis Hopper - or is it poorly written by Romero?) runs the skyscraper but Romero never explains the background story to us. All we know is that Hopper was rich and he set up walls around the city and somehow took over the area. Normally this lack of development is not a problem, but for someone of Romero's pedigree - it is inexcusable to gloss over the details as witnessed here.

The audience is left to imagine that some rich upper class people just took over a skyscraper and somehow enacted unchallenged authority over the poor working class slums. We get it - rich vs poor. But guess what George - this social satire is weak like wet tissue paper and holds as much weight. The rich people live in relative comfort and happiness (or so we assume) while the poor live in the streets below. We don't actually know much about either social class because the movie shows very little in the lives of these people. For all we know, the people run moonshine to Hazzard County during the day.

The hero of the movie (I forget his name) never reveals his past or his connection with anyone. Only that he wants to escape to Canada because there is nothing there. Are you kidding me? This joke is so over played it has become embarrassing. For Romero to resort to such ridiculous `jokes' should warn you of the effort he put into this movie and its story.

The quasi-hero of the movie played by John Leguizamo is bitter and angry at the rich guy because the rich dude refused to sell him an apartment in the skyscraper. Why you ask? - because he doesn't fit the WASP requirements. So Mr. Leguizamo decides to blow up the city with a super bat mobile or whatever the machine is called - and is labeled a `terrorist' by Hopper. Sounds like a joke right? You might be thinking to yourself `a kid in Grade 9 could write this kind of plot ` - well you would be right.

The zombies are intelligent and can reason. They also use weapons to attack. Why? This is ridiculous at best. Case in point - the main zombie scares Dennis Hopper into his car, fills the car with gasoline, then walks outside to get a grenade or something and rolls it back towards the gasoline filled car. Yah yippee lets cheer that some unknown bad guy gets blown up by a smart and vengeful zombie. Wow just bad.

Sure the gore is fantastic, and the zombies have some cool looking attacks - but this had been perfected in the previous DEAD movies. The real strength of Romero is his ability to satire societal problems into believable characters and amazing story telling. This movie has NONE of this. I was very disappointed with this movie - I find it hard to believe that Romero wrote this movie at all. There is absolutely nothing that connects this movie with any of his previous DEAD efforts. The social satire is gone, the character development is non-existent, and the plot is horrible. I really REALLY wanted to like this movie and was bitterly disappointed in a movie 20 years in the making. I hope the DVD has an additional 95 minutes of real Romero footage because that's the only way this movie can be redeemed.",1119830400,9,4733,4.578512396694215
1554505,1,B00005JO16,"Shame on you Mr. Romero! HORRIBLE! There is nothing redeeming about this film at all. As with last year's dreadful remake/update of ""Dawn Of The Dead"", this bomb features a ridiculous storyline with no characters that you can root for. The only reason you see a star is due to the fact that Amazon doesn't accept reviews without at least one! These truly are dismal days in Hollywood........",1119830400,4,391,4.764705882352941
1554582,2,B00005JO16,"This movie collapses under its own weight.  Romero attempts to make it more than just a horror movie, by not-so-subtly incorporating social and political commentaries.  We walk out of the theater suspecting that Romero supports anti-American terrorism.

The main character's final statement regarding the zombies, ""They're just like us, looking for a place to live"" (or something along those lines), is apparently supposed to justify the fact that he chooses not to kill them.  Not only is this trite, unrealistic dialogue, but it is stupid.  There is nothing wrong with self-preservation; it is an evolutionary mechanism that ensures the propagation of one's own genes.  Why on earth would you support other beings whose existence depends on your death?

Romero is clearly just another wealthy film-maker who feels that because he has the ability to broadcast his political and social views, that he should.  Perhaps he doesn't want to believe that people see this movie because they want to be scared, not lectured.  This movie collapses under its own bloated weight.

I am not impressed.",1119830400,3,1090,5.212643678160919
1554583,4,B00005JO16,"I had faith in George Romero in the the sense that I knew he wouldn't have made  another living dead film after so long unless he could provide us with something that was both satisfying for him as a director and capable of keeping hardcore fans of the series happy.  I was not let down.

The vintage Univesal logo that opens the film reminds one of the old classic Dracula and Frankenstein films; a good omen. While Land Of The Dead can't compare to those timeless classics, it is certainly a very worthy entry in the series and a considerably stronger film than Day Of The Dead (a movie I didn't like much at first,but grew quite fond of over the years.)

What distinguishes Romero from all the other zombie filmakers is his ability to impart real character and personality to the zombies.  Right thinking people will feel more sympathy and empathy with the lead zombie in this film than with Dennis Hopper's character, which brings us to another recurring theme in Romero's films: The human character who only thinks of himself and is motivated by a combination of greed and cowardice. (Refer to Henry Cooper in ""Night"".  The motorcycle raiders in ""Dawn"" and Captain Rhodes in ""Day"").

No, Land of The Dead doesn't have the polished, computer generated look of the recent ""Dawn"" remake. Although I enjoyed that film, I thought some of the effects looked fake; more like a video game than a zombie movie!  ""Land"" has a grubby, realistic look to it that makes me think a lot of the effects were probably done the old fashioned way; Always my preference.

The music, although not featured as prominently as in ""Dawn"" and ""Day"", serves the film well.  A sparse, haunting piano theme accompanies the living dead as they shuffle along.

Serious living dead fans take note:  There is a great new George Romero zombie flick out this summer.  It features a strong cast including Dennis Hopper and Asia Argento, Great special effects by Nicotero and Berger, Cameos by Tom Savini and Howard Sherman (""Bub"" from Day Of The Dead), some humor in just the right places and Romero's penchant for including some thought provoking social commentary.

And if all that's not enough to make you happy, it was among the top five grossing films in the country this weekend, while competing against the still popular Star Wars Episode III, and a hot new Batman flick....Life is good!",1119830400,,2362,4.729268292682927
1554584,5,B00005JO16,"Romero fans and zombie fans will probably be torn into at least two camps in regards to how they liked Romero's latest zombie epic.  Particularly, I think the turning point will be the fact that, as has been spoiled by numerous sources, the zombies are evolving.  But this has at least been subtly hinted at before because in Day of the Dead you not only had a zombie that could think but it was one that could speak as well.  Personally, I think the idea of ""evolution"" is an interesting and good step in the right direction.

But the best part of this movie, besides all of the fun gore and scares, is the fact that even today Romero has kept a firm grasp on his satiric style.  In Land of the Dead, the rich elite live in a tall ivory tower called Fiddler's Green, a bastion of light and beauty in an otherwise decimated world.  Commercials tell the poor and destitute people living the streets outside of Fiddler Green that this is the place to live.  The commercials are like the carrot on a stick concept, held there to entice the citizens into doing things for the rich elite on the offchance that maybe, just maybe, they too can become one of the elite.

This concept is taken much further, however, as you have the concept of money still alive.  Truly, in a society as decimated as theirs, what good is the green stuff?  But, they still hold onto it as if their society were what it used to be.  Scenes of people window shopping inside Fiddler's Green, the elite living as if the world outside wasn't dead, and Dennis Hopper's Kaupfman saying lines like ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"" just compound the satire.  It's fantastic and as satiric as Romero's earlier works.

Also in keeping with Romero's earlier works, the zombies retain a portion of what they used to be in life.  It's as if they are trying to be human again.  Just like in Dawn of the Dead, and the zombies who stalk the malls, the zombies in Land of the Dead are all questing to find that human quality.  In fact, it's kinda humorous that the zombies start marching on Fiddler's Green as if they too want to join the elite in it's Ivory Castle.

One reviewer here has commented that the movie doesn't look ""as sharp"" as some of the latest zombie movies and that the way it looks is from long ago.  Romero has always been an independent type director.  This movie is his most expensive film, granted, but in today's society of $100-200 million dollar movies, Land of the Dead cost only 15-20 million.

What us zombie fans have come for though, is of course the zombies.  Again, Romero did not fail as he has created zombies with character.  From the zombie band desperately trying to play their instruments, to the gas station zombie who is the first to evolve, all have more character than seen in the majority of zombie films.  My personal favorite is the nearly headless zombie.  You'll know what I mean when you see him.

Basically, this is Romero at the top of his game in my opinion.  It isn't as gory as the Dawn of the Dead remake, nor is it as scary or intense as some of the zombie movies out.  But, what it might lack in scares, it makes up for in intent.  As far as that goes, Romero is still the king.  Here's hoping it sells well so they make the sequel.",1119830400,,3248,4.393634840871022
1554585,2,B00005JO16,"I got to say, I was kind of disapointed. It wasn't like what I thought it was going to be. The most noticeable problem was the production. The film looked like it was 15-20 years old. It didn't have any of the clarity and high resolution that you would expect from today's movies, such as what you saw in the new Dawn Of The Dead, Resident Evil, or anything like van helsing or underworld. Sure, you can over do the digital clarity, such as in the first two star wars movies, but a certain amount of resolution is expected and this movie fell flat.

SPOLIER ALERT!

Second, the zombies were starting to figure stuff out. Meaning, they weren't just aimlessly searching for food, they actually seemed to have a leader, who when he grunted they seemed to understand what was going on. They also were more aware of their surroundings. One of the things is that the survivors shoot fireworks into the sky, because when they do, the zombies just stare at them and forget about the people, but towards the end, even that isn't effective. The zombies learn to ignore them, which is just as stupid as how they learn to stare at them in the first place. Also, there's a scene in the end when one of the zombies pours gas all over a car, and then wanders away. A short time later, he wanders back and directs a rolling flamming object towards the car, which of course bursts into flames. So the zombie knew that would happen? That's giving them too much credit. And when a few of the zombies learn how to use knives and guns as weapons? What a joke.

This has been done before, in the day of the dead, where it's shown that maybe the zombies retain and relearn some basic things, but it was stupid then, and it's stupid now. Sure, it's funny when the zombie butcher is still walking down the street waving a cleaver, and it was funny when the zombie band is still trying to play their instruments, but that's all it's good for, just a few laughs hear and there.

Overall, it was a total waste of money seeing this in the theater. I totally should have waited for the rental release. Maybe someday, the people who remade ""dawn of the dead"" can remake this film into something more enjoyable. Dawn of the dead was actually kind of freaky. Land of the dead is just stupid & silly.",1119830400,2,2266,4.3880952380952385
1554586,4,B00005JO16,"All in all, I expected more from Romero. . . then again, all in all it was a heckuva movie as well.  I would hate to give spoilers to the plot, so here goes. . . As movies have been going since the Millenium, this matches up to the top movies of any other genre.  It pushed the zombie genre forward by a leap, had plenty of comedy relief, and of course, the obligatory zombie gore and gross out scenes.  The only problems, in my opinion, were a couple of the actors and the fact that there were too many survivors.  I would definitely recommend it to any Zombie fans out there, or anyone who has a morbid curiosity with the darker sides of the human psyche.",1119830400,,657,4.149606299212598

Also, George, com'on!  If zombies have plagued the earth for decades, cities have fallen, I doubt very seriously if paper money would be worth anything.  Good top notch cast and loads of action.  Look for Bubba from ""Day of the Dead.""  What makes this one works is the gore.  It is ""Dawn of  the Dead"" level upgraded to big budget status.  Also, It is far superior to ""Day of the Dead,"" a yawnsville chatfest of never ending speeches that are completely meaningless.  I have a feeling around Halloween the DVD will be out and there will be an unrated Directors Cut.  The zombiea are smarter in this one and are crafty.  Its all about evolution.

1554588,2,B00005JO16,"Land of the Dead is bad, very bad. The acting is horrible. The plot, if you can call it that is equally bad. The zombies can now learn and are lead by a zombie named ""Big Daddy"" who used to pump gas. Its very lame watching him instruct other zombies how to use knives and guns.

Dennis Hopper is wasted and the building he inhabits is wasted as well. A lot of interesting stories could come from an entire town hiding from zombies with an ivory tower in the middle, but what we get is mindless action that goes nowhere.

The gore and zombies are still there and they get the 2 stars of this movie. I found the critics claim of politcal messages to be overblown. I noticed maybe one or two politcal statements. Also, there is no character development or backstory. How did Dennis Hopper come to be head of the city? How do the people who live in Fiddlers Green support their rent or their lifestyle habits?

Overall, i was letdown by this movie. I was more satisfied with the Dawn of the Dead remake last year. I hope Romero doesnt wreck his name more.

GRADE: D/D+",1119744000,2,1064,4.305
1554589,3,B00005JO16,"Just got back from seeing this movie, which made me think of all those nihilistic, post-apocalypse movies that were so popular in the '70's and '80's (Max Max, Soylent Green, Escape from New York, Logan's Run, etc).  Like LOTD, they were full of social commentary amid all the mayhem.  Unfortunately, most of the social commentary seems stuck in a retro time-frame as well.  For example:

1.  The heavy-handed, mindless consumerism theme was already explored in ""Dawn of the Dead"" (both versions) and not really expanded upon here.  In this time of TRL, Oprah's Book Club and celebrity obsessions, this is a missed opportunity.

2.  The caste system of the elites reaping all the rewards of soceity while the lower classes take all the risks storyline seems out of sych with new globalization realities re-ordering the economic pecking order almost daily.

3.  Where's the pervasive use of new technology that is also re-ordering and re-aligning our lives almost daily?  The film doesn't take advantage of all the 21st century equipment, tactics and strategies to control the zombie problem.  Where are the computers to target zombie populations, advanced weaponry and/or biological agents that could eradicate the zombies with strategic applications?  The most valuable weapon is a tank right out of ""The Road Warrior""!  Because the zombie problem would probably never be fully resolved, the populace could be placed in a state of perpetual vigilance and control by government edict.  Sound like any places you know today?

These would have been interesting social commentary themes to explore, but are not.

Finally, the most unforgiveable story element is the sympathy and forebearance that the humans show for the zombies at the end of the movie.  Didn't the humans just race back to the city to protect people from the zombies?  Didn't they just witness horrendous levels of violence and murder?  Then we're suppose to believe that the zombies are just ""trying to find their place in the world?""  Or, can this a final piece of social commentary?  Could it be Mr. Romero's way of parodying ultra-liberal attitudes of tolerance and forebearance no matter how heinous the behavior?  One can only wonder!",1119744000,2,2205,5.11484593837535
1554590,5,B00005JO16,"I'm glad to see George Romero back into the zombie game.  28 Days Later and the latest remake of Dawn Of The Dead were good movies and I even dealt with the fast moving zombies, but something was missing.  Shaun Of The Dead, homage to Romero's earlier zombie flicks, pretty much nailed it [and the Shaun folks get a cameo as zombies in Land].  Land Of The Dead is the correct mixture of humor, social commentary, and snapping and slurping sounds.  In Land, the rich folks are held up in a high rise condo in a fortified ""dahntahn"" Pittsburgh [recreated well in the studios and wilds of Ontario].  The poor folks are kept around to fight the zombies and scavenge goodies for the rich.  The zombies are getting smarter and a zombie named Big Daddy is leading the living dead straight to Pittsburgh.  Simon Baker [Riley] and Robert Joy [Charlie] play a Dominick And Eugene-style brother team who, along with Asia Argento [Slack], represent the living human heroes of our flick.  Dennis Hopper [Kaufman] and John Leguizamo [Cholo] give good turns as the living human villains.  The true star of the movie is Eugene Clark, who nails the role of the intellectually growing zombie leader Big Daddy [best supporting actor?...nah, the academy isn't that creative].  As a teenager, I used to hang out at the Monroeville Mall [site of the original Dawn Of The Dead] and shopped for school clothes at Kaufman's Department Store in ""dahntahn"", so I have strong feelings about Pittsburgh and the zombie legacy.  George Romero did not let us down!  Go see George Romero's land Of The Dead.",1119744000,,1574,4.7463235294117645
1554591,5,B00005JO16,"I've seen all of George A. Romero's zombie movies, starting with Night of the Living Dead (NOTLD), and found them a little boring.  To be fair, this is because everyone's been ripping off Night of the Living Dead since he created NOTLD, so what appears to be tired zombie fare to my jaded eyes is actually what Romero started.

Zombies in Night of the Living Dead are slow, shambling, recently dead people.  There are no running zombies here.  They can spread their contagion with a bite. The only way to stop them is by blowing their brains out (or stabbing them in the brain, or setting their brains on fire, you get the idea).  This traditional zombie trope has been done to death (pun intended), such that it's become a bit difficult to take slow moving zombies seriously.

Zombies were originally conceived as allegories first, horror monsters second.  The strength of Night of the Living Dead wasn't just the terror of cannibalistic strangers assaulting a home; it was the threat of the unwashed masses overwhelming the middle class.  The zombies in Romero's movies are slow, but they are relentless, and their numbers are legion.  Never mind that you can outrun them...eventually, they will catch up to you. Who's worse: the zombies outside or the people who will do anything to survive on the inside?  We know Romero's answer.

This class warfare was further explored in Dawn of the Dead, where we had the comedic ""shopping zombies.""  The film established that zombies struggle to recapture their old life, shambling aimlessly about in shopping malls...sort of like what they did when they were alive anyway.  Dawn of the Dead posited: Are zombies any different from uninvolved and unaware living citizens?  We know Romero's answer.

By Day of the Dead, we had the other side of the coin.  The previous films followed the travails of pockets of civilization and their struggle for survival.  In Day of the Dead, humanity's last hope is sequestered in a military installation.  There, scientists struggle to discover a cure, wage a philosophical (and sometimes physical) battle.  We're also introduced to Bub, a zombie who can learn.  Can the lower classes become better through education? We know Romero's answer.

Land of the Dead is the fourth movie in the series, and this time there's far less claustrophobia.  Whereas the first three movies centered on human protagonists holing up in a farmhouse, mall, or military base, the humans in Land of the Dead live in a city.  And this city has the full range of human triumph and misery, from its slums to a glittering tower known as Fiddler's Green. Lorded over by Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), it's a microcosm of society: white socialites in suits dine at the top of the tower while the poor mingle in all manner of vices, many of them supported by an easy supply of non-humans: the zombies.

But even the most powerful city has to be powered somehow, and ruthless scavengers (who drive an armored tank known as Dead Reckoning) stock Fiddler's Green.  This miracle of modern technology has a front-mounted gatling gun, missile launchers, nightvision, and armor plating.  It's just what you'd want if you were fighting zombies.  Riley (Simon Baker...wait, not that Simon Baker) lead his team, along with his cheeky second in command, Cholo (John Leguizamo).  Charlie (Robert Joy), who is mentally disabled and disfigured, follows Riley around like a puppy.  He also happens to be a crack shot.  There's also an ex-hooker named Slack (Asia Argento) who provides an audience point of view to the whole situation, but seems primarily to be there as a thank you to her infamous horror movie producer father, Dario Argento.

The opening scene, wherein Riley and Cholo demonstrate different interpretations of the term ""critical supplies,"" sums up the movie's ethos very quickly.  Cholo thinks booze and smokes are critical because they might gain him some influence with Kaufman, maybe even letting the mercenary move into Fiddler's Green.  Conversely, Riley wants to get antibiotics for the sick child of his friend.  Both men believe it will be their last mission amongst the ""stenchers,"" the phrase the humans use for the zombies.

But there's more to the zombies than meets the eye. A former gas station attendant turned zombie, Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), is a ""zombie lord"" of sorts.  He is self-aware and capable of learning, just like Bub.  He remembers parts of his old life and, more importantly, sympathizes with his zombie brethren.  When they are wounded, he is outraged.  Most frightening of all, Big Daddy can teach the other zombies what he knows.  It doesn't take long before he leads a zombie rebellion-straight towards Fiddler's Green.

When Cholo discovers that his boss will never give him a place in Fiddler's Green, no matter how many troublemakers he murders (along with the zombies), things turn ugly.  Cholo steals Dead Reckoning and drives off with the intent of holding the city hostage until he gets enough money to start his own city.  Ironically, Riley has the same plans, but discovers his car is stolen...because Kaufman wants him to stay.  Kaufman then promises Riley his freedom if he steals Dead Reckoning back before Cholo blows up the whole city.

Land of the Dead is surprisingly engaging; it's probably the first pro-zombie movie ever, casting the undead as sympathetic, pathetic, and clearly underclass: they are butchers, musicians, and yes, gas station attendants.  And as the zombies become more self aware, they lust for what the humans already have...more than just flesh, but their homes.  At first, fireworks awe the stenchers.  But eventually, even that is not enough to preoccupy them.

Romero knows his zombies well and films them in all their alternately gory, comedic and yes sometimes-beautiful glory.  We watch zombies from a God's-eye view, when they look only like everyday citizens, wandering about.  We see zombie and anguished citizens alike in a writhing pile of corpses and teeth.  Everywhere, Romero never lets us forgot that if you squint your eyes just enough, a zombie looks just like a person.  And if you can confuse the two, maybe things aren't so black and white as life and death, ""living"" and ""stencher.""

The parallels to modern day are a bit more subtle than say, Revenge of the Sith.  But they're still there.  Kaufman ""refuses to negotiate with terrorists."" The zombie life seems almost idyllic before the tank-like Dead Reckoning invades from Fiddler's Green, blowing the zombie-citizens to smithereens. It becomes rapidly apparent that Romero wants us to see the zombies not just as undead foils or evil monsters, but as people. And if they are capable of thought, then do the supposedly civilized humans have the right to shoot them in the head and take their resources?

We know Romero's answer.

Land of the Dead is a traditional zombie film with a lot to say.  Kids accustomed to the 2004 Dawn of the Dead-speed of horror will undoubtedly be disappointed.  But for adults who want a bit more from zombies than just dead people, Land of the Dead is lively indeed.",1119744000,,7091,4.949238578680203

I just have this to say,  If you are looking for a terrifying zombie movie then go watch your dawn of the dead, rabid human remake.  As for real zombie movies, they are really just monster-science fiction flicks.  Which is why Romeros are the best, because wether he knows it or not he treats them as such.  Yes, there is some incredible cheese, but it is tounge in cheek and very necessary to keep the movie from being a pretensious piece of garbage. Where does it rank in the recent zombie food chain?  Oh, very clearly at the top, holding only 'shaun of the dead""s hand in tow, and kicking away all of the other mindless ravenous drones in it's way.  Where does it rank w/ romero zombie fair?  Well I've only had a couple days to process it, and I just have to say that they are all good in thier own way, but the way I see it Dawn first, Land is second best, Night number three, and Day gets honorable mention at number four.  Let me just close this by saying that now that George has shown us how it's done, everyone else please stop making new zombie movies and don't try to bring anything new to the genre because it's getting old really fast!",1119744000,,1325,4.247011952191235

Many fans of the zombie genre will be upset by the ""changing of the rules"" with Land of the Dead's new breed of communicating, tool-weilding SMART ZOMBIES. These are even more terrifying than the earlier type. The ""leader"" of these new SMART ZOMBIES is known as Big Daddy (the name on the coveralls he died in). Many horror fans will be upset by his level of intelligence and question many details of his portions of the movie, but I was rooting for Big Daddy throughout the picture! The real villain in the film is Dennis Hopper's character, Mr. K. He is an oppressive, money-hungry dictator, operating a luxury condo tower for the rich in the middle of a small, zombie-free area full of frightened, sickly poor people. All told, it was a good horror movie with great gore AND solid characters. Not an easy feat for anyone, but George Romero.",1119744000,,922,4.628048780487805
1554682,4,B00005JO16,".....and thats it. It wasn't spectacular or nothing amazing, not even great, but it was good. I am a big fan of Zombie movies and have 40 or so on DVD, so I would consider my judgement pretty solid. Having the original Night Of The Living Dead, dawn of the dead ( the Original) plus the 4 disc box set, day of the dead ( 2 disc edition) and the new crappy/garbage Dawn Of The Dead ( not done by Romero ). I am a fan of Romero Zombie flicks. I would like to do as best as I can and go threw detail about what ever I can.

The Acting- Well for 15 Mill you kow what your getting, ofcourse its good.

The Gore- Was definitly there and I was definitly happy, if not for a worlld wide release probably would have been bloodier. Also like the fact that they show the Zombies feasting on people plenty of times. Which is what Zombie flicks these days forget to do ( EX. 28 days later and Dawn Of The Dead 2004 ).Thats what really makes the Zombie a Zombie.

The Scenery- Well done. This whole movie takes place at night which I love. To make a Zombie movie, the only way is to do it at night. The scenery is pretty creepy. the way they divide the land is also well done kind of like the zombies on one side and  the other community of people. You are Either rich( high Class) or poor ( low class )no inbetween.

Spcl FX- They are excellent, my personal favorite is the girl in the soccer jersey, she plays an excellent Zombie make up and acting, she does great, the Butcher is also good. Big Daddy's make up is horrible. He don't even look like a Zombie except for some rotted teeth. but overall the Fx are excellent the Zombies all look good the gore fx are all good and to an extent very real looking. I don't know who did the effects, I thought it was KNB but when reading the credits it says Greg Nicotero , so im not sure either way the effects are top notch, besides a couple animated parts.

BIG DADDY -  The most annnoying , all he does is grunt moan and cry, yes cry in his own way. He walks like a person, acts like a person and doesnt even look like a Zombie. My girlfirend and i were watching and after seeing hima couple times she was like "" he don't even semm like aZombie, and that he is annnoying "", which besides her and me plenty of people think so, read the reviews. he is I guess you could say the leader and genius of the bunch.

Zombies_- NO THEY DONT RUN, THANK GOD. They are not as slow as the orignal Zombies, but still are very slow but can move slightly better. Now what is pretty cool is the idea that these Zombies are starting to understand how to do thinnks at a real level that they are getting intellegent after being around so long, watching and learning. Makes it a but more challenging for the people that live in the city.

The plot- Very good and solid like th idea's that Romero has and uses. Does a great job.

Directing and Editing- is all done great also no complaints.

The Ending- Well I won't spoil it and say what happens, all i know is there will most likely be another part, probably called ""World of the dead""or maybe even just ""Dead Reckoning"" and I say Dead Reckoning because the way the movie ends , when you see you will understand. Basically one of the last lines of the movie made by Riley is pretty silly and i was just not really understanding why he did what he did, but overall not a bad ending I think it should have been a bit different or maybe better but it was still ok.

  Basically Horror movies in general have changed these days. Its hard to find a real good one. The new generations are coming up and in much of a sense things have to be made to appeal to the newer set of fans while occasinallly not forgetting about the old school fans of 70's and 80's horror like myself. While IMO horror was at its best, as soon as the 1968 NOTLD was made that opened doors for everything and everyone. And with no question marks Romero does satisy everyone , I know i was satisfied.

Its a movie well worth to see and when it comes out on DVD I will own it becuase it is a Romero Zombie flick, and will have to complete my set, plus don't get me wrong definitley worth the buy and the money for me atleast. If you are a die hard fan of Zombie flciks and have seen them all( from Romero to Fulci etc...) basically you will understand and appreciate where Romero is coming from and what his ideas are. and they are definitly good. I still love the stupid mindless slow moving human/flesh eating Zombies ,but times are changing so must everything else. Go see ""Land of the Dead""  you should enjoy it, I did.

This is the longest review i ever written.",1119744000,,4598,4.142536475869809
1554683,4,B00005JO16,"There's a lot of similararties between the two Georges, Lucas and Romero: both have been in the movie business for around 30 years, both have seen thier films praised and lambasted (often at the same time) and both demand a huge amount of creative control on thier projects.  So, when I say that ""Land"" is a lot like ""Episode III"", I mean it serves a sort of conclusion to a long running storyline where you've been waiting to find out how it all comes down. Also alike, it's not thier best works but not thier worst by far.  The main difference between the two is this: Romero fans will forgive the continuity errors and slight mistakes made in his film. Lucas fans will not. And that's an important distinction to make, because it determines how each movie will be enjoyed.  Set several years after the last ""Dead"" film, we find humanity's last refuge in a cordoned-off section of Pittsburgh (by way of Toronto). Dennis Hopper (at turns stiff and uncomfortable in what should have been a role that he could have gotten some real milage out of) is Kaufman, the head of the community and rules it from his glass tower, providing the less-fortunate with drugs and other vices to keep them from thinking about thier plight for too long. As for supplies, there is a team of mercenaries who use big vehicles and bigger guns to forage in the outside world. Food and medicine are gotten, but some of the team also pick up luxury items for the higher-ups in exchange for money or favors. Thier leader Riley (played by Simon Baker) is quitting in hopes of finding a place without either the dead or the living. His second, Cholo (John Leguizamo) is a social-climber wannabe who finally realizes he's never going to be asked to live among the idle rich, no matter what he does. In retaliation, he steals the ""Dead Reckoning"" a large urban assult vehicle, and threatens to destroy the pretty skyscraper Kaufman rules from, and pretty much everyone else. Kaufman convinces Riley to go after Cholo, who does so not for the rich but for the poor who might be hurt.  All the while, the dead, led by a very P.O.'d ""Big Daddy"", have decided they've had enough of the living's intrusions and head for the city to not only eat them but to exact some revenge. The brilliant twist is these semi-intelligent zombies sometimes don't even bother to eat the living: they're so mad they simply kill them outright.  While the ending may not have had a big feel to it, it was still good. The gore is easily a hard 'R', and I'm surprised at what got overlooked by the MPAA. While I'll be waiting for the unrated disc I did not feel cheated. So overall I'd say this film rates below ""Night"" and ""Dawn"" but above ""Day"". And that's not too shabby.  BTW: the crowd loved it, which is more than I can say for the previews for ""Supercross"", ""The Cave"" and ""Dark Water"". They actually were stunned by thier cheesiness.",1119657600,,2883,4.545279383429673
1554684,4,B00005JO16,"Well, here it is!  The movie most of us have been waiting 20 years to see.  To Romero fans, this is a pretty big deal, to everyone else, it's just another zombie movie that's come out.  To horror fans  this film has been anticipated like The Phantom Menace was to sci-fi fans.  Did it meet expectations?  No.  Twenty years of built up excitement for this film are the cause.  With that kind of anticipation, this could be probably the best film ever made and it still wouldn't live up to expectations.  So, no, it doesn't.  But is it a good movie?  Hell yes it is!  Romero's back to the genre he created to show all the Zack Snyders and Paul Andersons of the world how it's really done.  And it's a very welcome return after all the crapfests posing as zombie films that we've had to deal with in recent years.  These are the Romero zombies, not the running, jumping, hopping, skipping, galloping zombies we've been seeing recently(it's a large stretch of the imagination to accept the concept of a dead person coming back to life to eat you.  It's downright inane to accept a dead person coming back and acting like an olympic gymnast).  The subject is handled with intelligence, but at the same time never taking itself 100% seriously.  Day Of The Dead was quite grim, Land is a little more like Dawn.  In fact, the whole look and feel of this film reminded me alot of Tom Savini's Night remake.  Romero's working with a bigger budget here-for him anyway.  Not a Summer Blockbuster budget, but larger than anything he's worked with before, and he makes the most of it.  It's not a special fx extravaganza.  Romero uses fx when necessary, relying on good ol' storytelling to progress the film(imagine that!).  Even Leguizamo's good!  I was skeptical when I found out he was in the film.  Not that I don't like him, he just didn't seem to fit.  But Leguizamo has proven he can put on a serious performance when he wants to, and he does here.  I wasn't crazy about a few of the humor attempts.  Humor's played a role in all the Dead films, but I could have done without the Samoan character who has no purpose in the film but to say goofy lines.  Why are Samoans always the butt of jokes in movies?  Romero doesn't go overboard with CGI(thank god!), but there are a few cgi headshots that would have looked alot better had Savini done them.  In the past, Romero had been able to tell the execs where to shove their R rating, but the film business has changed ALOT in recent years.  George had to settle for that R rating coz mommy and daddy at the MPAA are looking out for us.  Don't worry, coz George promises the uncut proper version on dvd.  The violence here pushes the R rating almost to it's breaking point though.  All in all, I enjoyed Land Of The Dead and I'm very glad that George finally was able to make it.  If there's anything good to be said about crap like Resident Evil and House Of The Dead, it's that they probably helped open the doors for George to make this film.  It's not gonna please everybody.  The harshest critics of this film will be Romero's fans, all of whom have 20 years of built up expectations like myself.  The fact of the matter is, you're just not gonna please them all.  It's a helluva lot better than the Phantom Menace too.  I say support the master and go check it out in the theater before someone remakes it.",1119657600,,3351,4.4013050570962475

Romero and his films, but enough already with zombie flicks. Now as far as these ""Dead"" flicks go I would rank this one right at the top with Dawn of the Dead. I enjoyed the excess gore, the solid acting, and the great zombie makeup. I didn't really have much to complain about other than the fact that all these zombie films seem alike. Worth seeing if your a fan of the genre or want to see how the only person qualified to make a zombie picture still has the stuff when it comes to the genre he created with Night of the Living Dead.",1119657600,,697,4.208955223880597

I mean, if you are a fan of these movies, you expect it, but these 2 still shocked me enough (even though I'm sort of shell shock having seen so many horror movies!)",1119657600,,303,3.8870967741935485
1554687,3,B00005JO16,"Director George A. Romero's last film, Day of the Dead, was put out 20 years ago and since then fans have anxiously been awaiting the next chapter in his zombie saga. 2004's remake of Dawn of The Dead was enough to suffice our flesh-eating needs for the time being, but offered nothing new to the story. And now Romero returns to the silver screen with Land of the Dead, and although isn't bad for a zombie flick, it just feels like there should be something more to it. What has Romero been doing for the last twenty years? His time obviously wasn't completely spent working on this.

I don't want to sound like I'm totally dissing on this movie because I'm not. There's a lot of interesting, fresh and new ideas that were put into Land of the Dead. What's different about ""Land"" that seperates it from the earlier films is that by this time, the zombie epidemic is now established, and people have found a way to live (but dangerously) in a world overrun with zombies, unlike the earlier films which covered the time when the zombies first started taking over the world and covered people's reactions to it. Another thing that's new is that by this time, the walking dead have started to develop early signs of emotion, the use of weapons, and the power of working together. They even learn to swim. Seeing all this was very cool, but I feel that most of these ideas weren't developed to their full potential. Maybe we'll see more of that in next film, hopefully before the next twenty years.

Another thing that bothered me about the film was it's rather anticlimactic ending. When the end credits rolled I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. It seemed the movie ended abruptly and left me feeling somewhat satisfied, but wanting so much more.

So all in all, I do recommend seeing Land of the Dead because I've noticed very mixed reviews for this one, so it's hard to say if you'll like it or not. I, personally liked it and I'm sure when the DVD comes around I will have no choice but to buy it, but I feel like 20 years in the making, Land of the Dead should've offered just a little bit more, and I see it like lacking in the charisma that the earlier films had.",1119657600,,2179,4.4425
1554688,4,B00005JO16,"I saw this at a midnight showing, which I think is a good time to see a horror film.  Was I really excited to see this?... Yes!!!  I've been a huge zombie film lover for the last 6 years and it's all due to Romero's masterpiece ""Night Of the Living Dead"", the best and the first of all flesh eating zombie flicks.  I liked the other installments as well, ""Dawn"" and ""Day"".  What did I think of this film after seeing it?  Well, it was good, but I was expecting more.  I really wanted to see more of the zombies coming to a fuller realization that they can work together to finish off the existing human race.  That sounds a bit morbid, but I really wanted to see more exciting scenes of a working zombie army carrying machine guns and fighting the humans.  We started to see it in this film, but that started in ""Day of the Dead"" with zombie Bob.  Therefore I was expecting to see more of it in a more elevated scale.  I did like the Bid Daddy zombie, who seems to be the smartest of the bunch, too bad he was the only one to fully utilize his ability as a flesh eating corpse.  This movie did have more gore than the other zombie films of recent years (ie ""Shaun"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Dawn"" remake), but less compared to the original ""Dawn"" and ""Day"".  ""Day of the Dead"" had the best gore scenes because it seems so real with intense detail.  This movie did have some really good splatter moments that are new which I won't reveal.  This movie also had more sexual themes than the last 3.  A lesbian scene and some strip bar type nudity.  It also addresses the darker side of the human race in extreme social situations.  It has a strong cast of heroes, anti-heroes, and zombie favorites.  I've been reading that this was an edited version of the film, so I can't wait to see the director's cut.  It might actually have more of what I was expecting than the theatrical version.",1119657600,,1876,4.293447293447294
1554749,1,B00005JO16,"George Romero's Land of the Dead, the fourth in his series of zombie movies, opened this weekend in theaters nationwide. I have never understood the cult of Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead, as their one-note, nihilistic stories always appeared to me as little more than gore-pornography. Even so, I've always enjoyed horror films from the 70s and 80s, even bad ones, and must admit to taking some mild enjoyment from these films, but more for their anarchic spirit than for their storytelling and characterizations.

I've also never understood why George Romero has received such critical praise, finding his films impersonal, visually bland, and without creative energy. In fact, Romero's one defining characteristic as a director is his unflinching, unrelenting camera; this is a man with a genuine eye for gore -- make of that what you will -- and for me this is evidence of a juvenile, non-evolving psyche. Ironically, my favorite of his directorial efforts is Creepshow, a fun homage to EC Comics, but which owes most of its success to the screenplay by Stephen King.

If it wasn't for last year's two excellent zombie flicks, Shaun of the Dead and the remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, I probably wouldn't have been as interested in Land of the Dead. And if it wasn't for the financial success of these two films, Romero would have never gotten the funding for Land, and the world wouldn't be subjected to this uninspired bloody mess.

74 percent of the critics at rottentomatoes.com find this movie the work of a ""master"" film-maker. Somehow they forgive Romero his complete and utter lack of character development and camaraderie, his heavy-handed political allusions (bashing the Bush administration isn't an adequate replacement for bad writing), and the obvious financial limitations that Romero could not overcome (this looked like bad TV, with gore).

Land of the Dead is a remarkably bad movie and, like all of the Dead movies, it is less a piece of storytelling than a series of gorey observations. It's too tedius and awful a movie to contemplate for long, but I guess awful is what has made the career of George Romero and what his many fans continue to want. Personally, I can't understand it.",1119657600,9,2246,4.8871391076115485
1554750,3,B00005JO16,"After another director's successful remake of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and then the UK zombie parody ""Shawn of the Dead,"" it's kind of an appropriate time for George Romero himself to revisit his ""Dead"" series.  However, this story just never really kept me interested in it - although it wasn't for lack of trying.  All the familiar elements of the Romero zombie mythos are present, with a few new twists (the zombies are beginning to show the ability to think and act together).  In considering the problems I had with Land of the Dead, I think they can be summed up by saying that it wasn't clever enough, and it just didn't scare me.  Romero's high water mark, the original ""Dawn,"" featured the brilliant concept of taking place almost entirely within a suburban shopping mall.  ""Land"" has no such uniqueness in any of its ideas.  One of the big ideas for this new movie is the ""Dead Reckoning,"" a tank-like vehicle designed for the war on the zombies.  That idea reveals the essence of my problem with the movie - my reaction was not ""how cool!"" but more like ""ho hum.""  In fact, the idea seemed to borrow from Zach Snyder's armored/reinforced school bus in the Dawn remake.  As for the non-scares, it was so common in this flick for an unsuspecting character to be jumped from behind by a zombie that such moments became the OPPOSITE of suspense.  If someone was alone in some kind of a situation, it was EXPECTED that they would get jumped by an Undead.  No surprise at all.  After enjoying Snyder's remake, I was looking forward to a new Dead picture from the Master himself, but maybe he's not such a Master after all.",1119657600,,1622,4.555172413793104
1554751,4,B00005JO16,"The dead are coming for you, but this time they have a plan.  They move forward with ruthless abandon hacking, grabbing, and tearing for whatever human they could possibly gobble up without personal greed and share their victims with their fellow dead.  Blood is gushing, entrails are flowing, and flesh is torn off between decaying teeth.  It is obvious that George Romero has not lost his touch with the splattering gore even though his Night oft he Living Dead (1968) was very timid in comparison with Land of the Dead.  However, the first three zombie films by Romero got increasingly bloodier and visually more disturbing from which the audience can deduce that this film will out do his previous films.

By building on previous films Romero continues to tell the bloody tale where humans must find a way to to survive among an increasing number of hungry dead.  The story takes place in present day, years after the outbreak that murdered millions of people, where an enclave have barricaded themselves from the zombies.  This enclave periodically sends hired soldiers to search for equipment, food, and other necessary items for healthy living.  When these soldiers drive out on their missions they bring a tank the size of a semi with high tech equipment called the Dead Reckoning that serve as a tool against frequent zombie attacks.  The story begins where Riley (Simon Baker) is on one of these gathering missions where he detects some zombies communicating in a small abandoned town, which troubles him.

Riley is the commander of the group and it is his last day working for the enclave's military force gathering items.  Nonetheless, he still demands that his group follows the rules of engagement, but he has trouble controlling the unruly Cholo (John Leguizamo) who often does as he likes.  It is also Cholo's last day working outside the enclave.  The two are polar opposites where Cholo is an attention seeking egoist with the behavior of a thug who could care less about people while Riley is a caring loner with natural charisma that easily gains followers including Charlie (Robert Joy) and Slack (Asia Argento).  An obvious tension exists between the two, as Riley follows his own way while Cholo is a mere lap dog for Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) who is the powerful despot of the enclave for which they work.

Cholo desires to move into the luxurious Fiddler's Green within the enclave, an immense skyscraper for rich and powerful, which has all the necessities and comforts people can dream of in order to forget the unforgiving world outside.  He has saved up all of his capital in order to leave the poverty outside the Fiddler's Green, but Kaufman enlightens him that he is not a desired element within the luxurious society.  In rage Cholo escapes the enclave, as he also steals the Dead Reckoning and threatens to blow up the Fiddler's Green unless he is paid five million dollars.  Kaufman requests Riley's cooperation to prevent Cholo from destroying Fiddler's Green and bringing back the Dead Reconing.  In the middle of the blackmailing situation it seems as if the zombies have begun their own siege of the enclave, as they seem both motivated and organized when they devour those who oppose them.

Land of the Dead has some captivating similarities with Dawn of the Dead (1978) when Romero offered an intriguing illustration of commercial society and philosophical existentialism through some survivors in a shopping mall.  Here Romero offers a clever societal criticism where he openly displays humanity's inability to cooperate, as greed and other personal desires prevent people from creating a safe society.  In the light of the thinking human, the zombies are brain-dead creatures, a mere shadow of what they were when alive.  However, Romero leaps and crosses the borders to displays how selflessly these flesh desiring dead approach the living sharing their entrails with a common goal despite being unable to form complex thoughts.  He even suggests through the comparison between the humans and the zombies that mankind's ability for complex thoughts and problem solving might also be humanity's demise.  In addition, Romero displays the other side of the coin, as cerebral activity on a high level can also be a useful tool for continued existence in peace.

George Romero finds an adequate amount of financing for this film, which means that he can go beyond what he created in the previous films.  For example, the gore ceaselessly continues until the final scene and he could hire a cast with proven talent that could strengthen subplots through terrific performances.  Romero could also be more inspirational in his way of creating the horrifying scenes while many of these scenes also offer subtle and dark humor.  One of the more amusing scenes is when two zombies play wishbone with a human hand and none of the zombies win.  Overall, Romero does a very good job bringing this story to the audience, as it offers much fright, entertainment, and some interesting notions to ponder in the light of the rivers of blood that leave the screen.",1119657600,13,5086,4.970484061393153

The zombie priest is the coolest death scene in a zombie movie since Rhodes got it in ""day"".

I simply can't relate to all of this, as EVERY Romero zombie flick is the same movie with the same plot outline...

1.  Humans barricade themselves inside some setting (eg a house, shopping mall, bomb shelter).

2.  The humans can't seem to get along, and are too busy fussing among each other to keep an  eye on the ghouls.

3.  Zombies break into the barricaded setting and kill everyone.

4.  A handful of humans escape.

It's the same thing with Land of the Dead.  Just replace the shopping mall with a fenced- in city.

If this is social commentary, then social critics are a penny a dozen.",1119571200,3,885,4.547770700636943
1554757,4,B00005JO16,"Twenty years after the lukewarm reception to the series third entry, writer/director George A. Romero is able to explore the other half of the scenario in his original, and un-filmed, Day of the Dead script.  All I can say is that, for this fan, it was worth every minute of the wait...

Some time ago the dead began to rise up and attack the living.  Because a bite from a ""walker"", or ""stench"", is a death sentence, the people they killed got up and killed.  Society quickly crumbled, the major cities becoming fortified shelters for those lucky, or unlucky, enough to survive.  Within one of these fortified cities is Fiddler's Green, a shining luxury tower owned and operated by the wealthy Kaufman (Dennis Hopper).  To keep the people in the Green fed and happy Kaufman has built the Dead Reckoning, a muscular marriage of truck and armored vehicle, to go out into the ""walker"" infested areas and collect food, water and medicine.  Manning these runs are mercenary teams led by Riley (Simon Baker) and Cholo (John Leguizamo).

The raid of Uniontown is Riley's last run.  While scouting the area, he notices that the ""walkers"" are remembering their former lives.  More disturbing is that they seem to be starting to communicate with one another.  His warning is ignored by Cholo, who just wants to grab some extra loot for financial gain, and the raid goes sour.  The team leaves Uniontown, but the ""intelligent walker"" that caught Riley's attention, a burly gas station attendant named Big Daddy, begins to follow...using Kaufman's glowing ivory tower as the visual goal to be reached.

Riley and Cholo return to the Green, unaware that they are being followed by the undead.  Riley hopes to get a car he has purchased and leave the city for a simpler, and uninhabited, area.  Cholo hopes to buy his way into Kaufman's tower, but he is refused by the slimy fat cat.  Determined to bring Kaufman down to his level, Cholo steals the Dead Reckoning and Kaufman sends Riley out to get it back.  Meanwhile the zombie horde is beginning to launch an organized attack against the city...

Based on my first impression, all I can say is that Romero does not disappoint.  Land of the Dead is a lean and mean (both figuratively as well as literally) thrill ride that both encapsulates and expands upon the concepts and storylines of the previous three entries in the series.

The acting is pretty much the best in the series.  Dennis Hopper underplays a part that, if a little more ham had been added to it, would have become a cartoony figure.  By keeping it quiet and subtle, Hopper let's us see the vile and monstrous power that is coiled beneath his falsely gentle and polite exterior.  Simon Baker likewise underplays Riley, but considering that his character wants nothing more than to just disappear, his fading into the crowd likewise makes his character feel real.  John Leguizamo's Cholo is a swaggering mix of anger and frustration just waiting to explode...and explode he does.  I have to say that Robert Joy's Charlie is my favorite character.  A simpleton fiercely devoted to Riley who also serves as the voice of Riley's supressed soul.  Rounding out the main cast is the stunning Asia Argento as Slack, a prostitute who, when she is tossed to the zombies, Riley rescues and reluctantly befriends.  Argento manages to nicely balance Slack between being both vulnerable and as tough as nails.

KNB's gruesome zombies and their feasting scenes are top notch, despite the cuts for an R rating.  Don't let that R rating fool you into thinking that Land is some kind of watered down vision, far from it.  There are more than enough gruesome set pieces to wet the appetite of the expectant gore hound.",1119571200,9,3705,4.778301886792453
1554758,4,B00005JO16,"George A. Romero delivers a fine addition to his Living Dead series, but it's not without its faults...

First, apparently paper money still drives the economy in this post-apocalyptic world, which I find highly dubious...I guaran-damn-tee you, if our society resembled the society in ""Land"", the person with the most power will NOT be the guy with a wad of useless currency, but likely the guy who was savvy enough to stock up on cigarette cartons and/or liquor (not to mention, in the opening few minutes of Day Of The Dead, there's a revealing camera pan which pretty much established the worthlessness of cash, so why would it suddenly work now?).

Second, the soundtrack lacks the ""ghoulish"" feel of ""Night"", ""Dawn"", and ""Day"", occasionally sounding better suited for a PlayStation2 game...then again, I don't know how the music of Goblin would go over during a scene with an urban assault vehicle.

And third, the movie clocks in just over 90 minutes, the shortest of the Dead quartet. As a result, the pacing seems more hurried than Romero's other ""Dead"" films, with an ending that comes as sudden as a 50-caliber to the brain. Perhaps the inevitable director's cut DVD will erase that criticism.

Now onto the good stuff. First, if you are worried that the gore factor will be toned down since ""Land"" isn't an NC-17 flick, relax...not only is it plenty gory, it's downright creatively gory. You'll alternately laugh & squirm at some of the tricks Romero cooked up in this one (No spoilers, but I'll say this: you'll never pull apart a wishbone again without thinking of this movie).

Second, the acting is a notch above the usual Romero zombie flicks...if only the pacing allowed some better character development 'tho, we mighta had a movie on the level of ""Dawn"".

Third, it's the ""best looking"" Dead film in all aspects, and some of the visuals are just plain creepy (most notably, a scene with an army of zombies emerging out of the river...whoa). Tom Savini doesn't handle the makeup chores this time around (but he makes a cameo in the movie, and Dead fans will recoginze the callback to ""Dawn""), but Romero keeps the talent in-house with onetime Savini assistant Greg Nicotero, who's work had already passed the litmus test by longtime fans.

And finally, although I balked about the currency factor, the actual storyline itself is an intriguing one, and for the most part Romero pulls it off...although admittedly, he's really gonna need to outdo himself should he expand the zombie evolution further with another Dead film. There's more depth than meets the eye, and it wouldn't be suprising if, for a moment or two, you feel uneasy noticing the hierarchy/class structure in the movie mirroring a few corners of the globe in ""real life"".

Overall, I recommend Land Of The Dead...despite its flaws, Romero fans & old-school horror fans should get their money's worth. It may not be the classic we hoped for, but it's still in a class with a short roll call...",1119571200,3,2975,4.84251968503937
