7929951,4,B000053GSY,This video does not just cover skiing and snowboarding - it covers all sorts of other activities including rock climbing.  There are certainly some very skilled kids out there.  I had hoped for a little more of a teaching video - the steps to developing the stunts but it does not do that.  Still not bad however.,1394841600,,313,4.456140350877193
7929952,3,B000053GSY,"This DVD is actually about Grommets (not Gromes).
Has fantastic action from these champions of tomorrow between 8-18 years old.  Shows Skiing, snowboarding, wakeboarding, skateboarding and climbing.
Excellent scenery and minimal commentary.  A nice addition to the snowboarding or skiing collection especially for trick and big air enthusiasts.  Is a good trick reference.",997920000,2,372,5.981132075471698
