4461796,1,B002KB8LSA,"I have read other reviews of History Channel productions which panned their believability, but it wasn't till now that I have understood why. This mangling of history begins with a very little smattering of responsible commentary by credible historians. But then it falls apart and descends into yellow journalistic drivel through the mouths of Sally Denton, Will Bagley, and sensationalist narrator Bill Curtis.

Curtis begins by comparing the event to 9-11 in New York. Oh brother; we know what we're in for right at the outset. Curtis' non-historically substantiated statements are too many to enumerate, but here are a few: ""Mormons seemed to live by their own rules."" ""Brigham Young seemed to pick and choose the laws he will obey.""  ""The arrival of U.S. troops brought peace to Utah."" (Untrue. There had always been relative peace up to that time in Utah.) ""Brigham Young was removed from his post as governor and pardoned for his treasonous acts."" (There had been no treasonous acts. Some politicians from a distance LIKENED Young's behavior as treasonous merely because he, for the time being, had assumed authority in the area - the area that he and his people had pioneered and settled. ""Church officials attest[ed] that native americans [were] responsible for the killings."" (False. Brigham Young and church officials in Salt Lake never at any time lied about the atrocity.)
With sinister sound effects accompanying, Curtis' emphatic, accusatory voice reached a fever pitch when he repeated the rant written by James H. Carlton: ""But how inadequate would be the punishment of a few even by death for this crime for which nearly the whole mormon population from Brigham Young down were more or less instrumental in perpetrating.""  Curtis again: ""Brigham Young is furious over the army's tribute"" [to the victims at the crime scene]. Of course, neither Curtis nor Will Bagley, who have no interest in truth in perspective, refuse to mention that what irked Young was the inflammatory message written on the cross that Carlton posted over the graves, ""Vengence is mine, I will repay, saith The Lord,"" which was unmistakably meant to paint all Utah Mormon as dangerous fanatics.

But what would be perspective about this horrible event? Perhaps we start by acknowledging that the affair absolutely was an atrocity; it was horrid. But fair, honest minds would simply want to know more. After searching, they would find out that the Latter-day Saints could not find justice or safety in their own country. During the first decades of their history they were harassed, killed, faced an ""Extermination Order against the Mormons"" issued by the Governor of the State of Missouri (an order that was followed by a massacre of Latter-day Saints at Haun's Mill), their homes burned, their women violated, property stolen, driven from place, to place, to place, to place. Finally their founding prophet was murdered via a conspiracy. And then one last exodus--that involved crossing our continent, during which hundreds dropped dead by the way and buried in shallow graves.

Now, without having walked two meters in their shoes, where would you guess breaking point would be? Might you perhaps expect that there would be just a few, somewhere, who would decide on their own that enough is enough, and that if they appear to come for us again they will reap the whirlwind? There was also an atmosphere of hysteria at the time--brought on not by Brigham Young (Will Bagley's unproved pet idea)--but by conditions and circumstances. Part of that were the rumors that the U.S. government was sending an army out to Utah to quell a ""Mormon rebellion."" The ""rebellion"" did not exist, but talk of an army approaching was true. Put it all together.

None of this excuses them for their heinous actions. But this and other truth in history may be what led non-Mormon scholar Ray Allen Billington, in his classic university text ""Westward Expansion,"" to summarize his view on the Mountain Meadows Massacre by writing, ""Though the massacre was inexcusable, under the circumstances it was understandable.""",1379635200,5,4089,5.086438152011922

8439439,2,B002KB8LSA,"History, doing its best to rewrite history to suit a current mind set, based on a modern frame of reference.  Our current frame of reference cannot tolerate the materials here in a way to allow the individual to interpret and judge the actions and attitudes of these people involved.  We are unequipped and poorly prepared, and are left to figure out too many things for ourselves than say,...people that just lived two generations ago.
There is not a story, if shown in the way this film was contrived, where any other contemporary event of the time would be reviewed and dealt with so harshly.  (When was the last time you witnessed a public execution in a town square, as was the practice at the time.)
It is sad to think there are no producers or directors who cannot manage to report an event rather than tell a ""story""  concerning these poor people.  Come on, set the scene!  Inform the viewer rather than let them continue to live in a Bonanza, Wagon Train fairyland, and expect them to makes heads of tails of ""the simple facts' as this film reports.  This docudrama, is as wrong as reading the 'Killing Fields' to kindergartners. (no offense intended,  just a representative example of unnecessary sensationalism as found in this piece.)
