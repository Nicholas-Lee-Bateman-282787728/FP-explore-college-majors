2112104,4,B0002OXV9Q,"If your old enough to remember these cartoons, then you understand what I'm talking about.
Back in the day when mom and dad let you stand up in the car sometimes jumping up and down only to have your parent slam on the brakes because some J-A cut them off, and you crash into the (STEEL) dashboard.
You picked your self up, brushed your self off and sat your BUTT down. You didn't darn cry because you'd get smacked again.
Thats what theses cartoons are all about, we all knew that if someone fell off a cliff you didn't get up and walk away. Coyotes didn't fly around on rocket motors and when a SEXY Lady walked by there would be Wolf whistles.
These are some of the best, made during that time frame, I'm just happy that everyone in the world doesn't think it's always important to be politcally correct.",1268265600,3,807,4.3509933774834435
2112105,4,B0002OXV9Q,"These cartoons are from the ""Wacky World of Tex Avery"" series that ran on TV in the late '90's.  They are done in the ""Tex Avery"" style - stretching characters, popping eyeballs, shattering teeth, etc - and have new and original characters, such as ""Tex Avery"", ""Power Pooch"", Pompeii Pete"", ""Freddy the Fly"" (my favorite), and ""Einstone"" the cave-genius.  If you love funny animation and frantic story-telling these cartoons will be sure to bring lots of laughs.  I've got them all, and frankly, I think the other reviewers are shockingly ignorant.  Anybody who loves and follows animation knows these shows and recognises them as totally original and very funny.",1240444800,,664,5.064220183486238
2112106,5,B0002OXV9Q,This wasn't what I thought it was when I bought it but it works and there are no complaints.  It's just my fault for not reading before purchasing.  DVD works great!,1210204800,4,165,4.290322580645161
2112107,1,B0002OXV9Q,i was disappointed with this set of toons. i was expecting some of the old classics like barney bear and screwy squirrel.,1209859200,39,121,4.545454545454546

This is a terrible disappointment to anyone who thinks the product has anything to do with the classic Tex Avery cartoons done for Warner Bros or MGM.  Instead you get a series of the new style made for TV cartoons that just move fast and crazy instead of showing any of the art or comic timing that Tex was known for.",1206316800,67,524,6.178082191780822
2112109,1,B0002OXV9Q,"This is NOT the Tex Avery of the classic MGM, Warner Brothers, & Walter Lantz Cartoon fame.  This is a cheap TV show, released by DIC, ripping off the classic cartoon director's name and shamelessly using it for its main character & series name.

You will NOT find the classic Droopy here!

You will NOT find the classic Little Red here!

You will NOT find the classic City Wolf here!

2112110,1,B0002OXV9Q,"A few years ago,a cartoon company came up with the idea to cash in on Tex Avery's name,round about the time The Mask was making it big in the box office and everyone was all into him,and created a cartoon cowboy of the same name. This collection is of that cartoon character,NOT the legendary animator.

If you're looking for the real Tex Avery's works,look elsewhere. If you want to see blatant profit making off the name of a dead guy,this is more what you want.",1106870400,147,464,4.458823529411765
2112111,1,B0002OXV9Q,"As near as I can tell, not a single one of these cartoons was done by Tex Avery since none of them seem to be reflected on any list of his body of work.  They appear to have been done by somebody else ""in the style of Tex Avery"".  This product is mis-represented by the producer and by Amazon.com",1102982400,104,296,4.0

8030147,1,B0002OXV9Q,"I should have read the description and reviews first. This is NOT the Tex Avery style that we all know and love. I was expecting the great cartoons from the 40's and 50's. I fast-forwarded through the first DVD, hoping there would be classic cartoons later on, but no such luck. These are all cheesy cartoons from the 90's. I will never watch these! Will most likely give it away.",1362873600,,380,4.442857142857143
8030148,1,B0002OXV9Q,"This deceptively pitches itself as the work of Tex Avery. However it is a sub-par cowboy cartoon series where the main character is named Tex Avery. It claims to be inspired byTex Avery's animation style (bitch, please!) but is not amusing, entertaining or otherwise worthwhile in any way. False advertising to be sure. Avoid like herpes!",1357776000,,338,5.053571428571429

8030151,1,B0002OXV9Q,"The cartoons on this tape are ""in Tex Avery's style."" That is, they've used many of the tropes Avery did -- fast action, sexy women, (allegedly) goofy characters -- but managed to avoid anything resembling humor. The cartoons are annoying at best but more like painful to watch.

(purchased a bunch of cartoons that day, rushed it, my fault) This is just some modern cartoon of the usual low end production, nothing like the original theatrical shorts of Tex Avery. Very disappointed.",1269820800,28,349,5.0344827586206895
