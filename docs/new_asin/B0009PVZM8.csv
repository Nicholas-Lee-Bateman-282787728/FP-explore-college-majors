2312825,5,B0009PVZM8,"I must confess, I am addicted to British period dramas. The very fact that Our Mutual Friend is within this genre makes it appealing to me from the start. Until now, this outstanding (yet relatively unheard of Dickens masterpiece) has only been available on VHS, that is, IF you could even find it (and then you would have paid premium cash for it). The last of Dickens' literary works seems to coalesce all of his remarkable abilities to show the worst and best of a society which was marked by the haves and have-nots with an impassable chasm between. Do you like it when the the evil get their due and the good come out all right? Do you like films that are even better the second and third time you watch them due to subtleties in character development and plot progression that seem to become more apparent with every new viewing? Then click on ""buy"" now!",1119052800,13,860,4.484076433121019
2312826,5,B0009PVZM8,"This is an excellent adaptation of the book- yes, it leaves out a few things, but overall it does a great job of converting a mammoth novel to a screenplay.  The acting is great, and the character development is wonderful.  The directing does run a bit slow in spots.  If you're a fan of ""Pride & Prejudice"" (and thus don't mind long movies), I think you'll enjoy ""Our Mutual Friend"".  I'm so excited this is coming out on DVD- I've been waiting for it!",1117497600,6,453,4.357142857142857

I can't believe I hadn't heard of this Dickens' gem until this week.  ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" and ""Great Expectations"" were all I knew of this talented author.

2312849,2,B0009PVZM8,"This review is based on my viewing of the series . I have not read the book.
This is a VERY dramatic & darkly  intense series.
It's not clear to me why so many men are fixated/obsessed on the girl, but it seems more like an unbearable burden than flattery to her.
Indeed, I found that even the nice guy's attention was really over the top, bordering on creepy stalker & not at all romantic.
The ending tidies up nicely, offering relief from the extremely dreary & painful journey that the story takes to come to it's completion.

It needs to be noted that there is an instance of full male nudity.",1500854400,,597,4.321428571428571

Cutting out their scenes leaves episode 4, especially, disjointed and confusing.

Our Mutual Friend has many recurring themes~ Old Money, New Money, Trade, Greed, and both family/ friendly relationships... It's not long, spanning season after season, but it packs one or two necessary punches! If you're looking for something light and thoughtless, this may NOT be the show for you.

2312926,1,B0009PVZM8,"**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS** This is NOT a review for the DVD version of Our Mutual Friend. That version deserves five stars and is a wonderful production which I've watched many times over the years. This review is for the STREAMING VERSION which Amazon falsely presents as being no different from the DVD version. The streaming version is a disappointing, stripped-down version which is missing what another reviewer estimates to be about 45 minutes of information. For example, if you loved Mr. Sloppy (played by Martin Hancock) in the DVD version, well, sorry, but he isn't in the streaming version at all, except for one brief scene at the end where he's shown sitting on a picnic blanket next to Jenny Wren. If you didn't see the DVD version, you might wonder who he is.and how he met Jenny. Since all the Mr. Sloppy scenes have been cut, you will never really know how Bella came to fall in love with John Harmon or how she came to be friends with Lizzie Hexam. Since Bella's conversation with Lizzie is a turning point in Bella's understanding of her own character, it's nonexistence cheapens the whole series. (The streaming version shows Bella at Lizzie's wedding, but the viewer has no idea how they became friends since there are no scenes with them even meeting each other prior to the wedding.) All the scenes about Betty Higden and the Boffins wanting to adopt Little Johnny are missing, as are the scenes involving Betty Higden leaving and being found by Lizzie Hexam. The grand finale when Mr. Sloppy is used to execute judgement on Silas Wegg is also sadly missing. Other random but important scenes are missing as well, including the scenes involving the schoolteacher who is in love with Bradley Headstone. I purchased the streaming version because I wanted to be able to watch Our Mutual Friend on my tablet, and I must say I was so angry when I realized what was missing that I wish there was a way to get my money back for being misled into thinking this was the same as the DVD version. It is not the same at all!  Amazon should either refund the money for those of us who believed we were purchasing a digital version of the DVD version, or they should restore all the original scenes to their proper places. As an adoring fan of the original DVD version, this purchase is a huge disappointment for me. I didn't read any of the reviews before I purchased this because I had already seen the DVD version many times and loved it, and I had no reason to imagine that there would be so much cut from the streaming version. Badly done, Amazon. Badly done.",1468195200,10,2580,4.596529284164859
2312927,1,B0009PVZM8,"I love this series and have seen it several times, which is why I was SO DISAPPOINTED to find that my digital order was missing many scenes, that I considered very important to the story line.

This is one of the best adaptations of his works I have seen. The first episode is a little hard to follow, but bear with it. In the second episode, the pace picks up and the deftly written script, along with the exceptional acting, will carry you through to the end. Standouts are Paul McGann as Wrayburn, and Keeley Hawes as Lizzie. Their story is heartbreakingly beautiful, and the two actors do it complete justice. The production is also to be commended in that it does not shy away from the core message of the book -- a scathing commentary on class disparity in Victorian England. The book is dark, intense, and yet funny -- like most Dickens tales. The production manages to capture the combination of all those things exceedingly well.",1440201600,2,919,4.575757575757576

It is edited for time, and unfortunately the edits are very clumsy. The whole Sloppy plot is cut: I can see someone saying ""Oh, that's a minor character. Easy to cut for time.""

That said, it's difficult to swallow the concept of how mistreated women and the poor were in London during those times without a little help from the producers - my only quibble to an otherwise splendid production.  For example, Belle is presented as a feisty, highly-independent young woman, yet when she finally falls in love with John Harmon, this all leaves her in a flash and she permits herself to be used in a bizarre game of character testing.  During that time period, Dickens could get away with a boatload of assumptions, but it would have been nice to have seen more of what was going on inside Belle's head.

The dialog is superb and most of the acting first-rate.  Highly recommended!",1425945600,2,805,4.680851063829787

2313031,5,B0009PVZM8,"Fans of Charles Dickens, BBC productions and period films can't go wrong with Our Mutual Friend.  This movie lets Dickens put us exactly where he wanted us, and were we living in his era, we would have been part of the shifts he advocated to see humans lifted out of the squalor and ignorance that engulfed English society at that time.  We would have been that convince and so moved to help solve the problems they faced.  What a miserable time; so many where coughing and tubercular, no one seemed to be able to figure out how to provide a sanitary atmosphere, there was no concept of what a germ was, and for most, there was no way to ever be clean.  This film does a good job of getting all that across.  But, the great mountains of dust and garbage?.... we still have those and people still must sort through them to earn a living in many parts of the world, including the most civilized of countries.  Our own, for example.  People are still enslaved by hideous poverty and filth, are confined by social boundaries and confused by morays that disallow the freedom of true expressions of love and caring.  And, then there is aspect of greed and that is still alive and well and thriving gloriously, pretty much anywhere you want to look!

Before settling down to watch this, recent literature about Dickens' own life swirled around in memory and the urged me to shy away from being the solid fan of his work that I once had been, and this was gearing up to put a damper on my enthusiasm for this film.  But, all and all, he remains a hero.  He was rotten at a bunch of stuff in his personal life, but he was devoted to exposing the misery his fellow man had created had created for each another.  Dickens was a master and his work merges with our own era beautifully.  He's a man of our times.

In this, we can also see some of the more interesting character actors lifted from this film to land, some years later, in the Harry Potter productions.  Those would be the ones with horrible teeth and wispy thinning hair.",1425168000,,2022,4.397849462365591

Under the best of circumstances, since the book is so long (almost 900 pages) I can see the necessity of cutting out large portions of the book (seems like around 40%) in order to make it manageable for the screen. I watched this mini-series years ago when it was on television, and loved it. I was so excited to finally see it on Amazon Instant Video. What I do not understand, though, is that it appears that even more time has been cut in this newest version, and, from I what recall, a few very important story lines. Disappointing.

2313116,5,B0009PVZM8,"I have been a fan of Charles Dickens since high school days when we had to read ""Great Expectations"" and ""Tales of Two Cities"".  Prior to watching this video series, I was not very familiar with this particular book from Charles Dickens.  I believe that this is the last book that Charles Dickens wrote prior to this death.  After watching this series, I then went and read novel itself.  The producers of this video series did a very good job in adapting this novel into a video format.  Over the years I have had the chance to read more and more of the novels of Charles Dickens and I have really come to appreciate his work.  He appears to have been a social reformer and he wanted to make people aware of the inequalities in the society of his time.  Our present generation could really use another modern day version of Charles Dickens.  So many of the things that he depicts in his novels are still with us, as avarice and greed,  which once again seem to become highly lauded characteristics by many people today.
The camera work on this video series was excellent.  When the camera takes you down to the waterfront where the bottom level of society tries to eek out a living, the skies turn dark and gray and all of the building and people have a darkened color to them which symbolizes that hopelessness of the people and the society that lives here.  On the other hand, when the camera takes you into the parlors and drawing rooms of the upper crust of society, the skies are blues and the colors of the buildings, clothing, etc. takes on vibrant colors.
Looking back, I often wonder why my teachers choose to use ""Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Great Expectations"" in their classrooms.  They may have done this due to the fact that this novels are shorter in length.  I think my teachers would have done a much better job in presenting Charles Dickens if they had instead chosen ""Out Mutual Friend"" and ""Little Dorrit.  While these novels may have been much longer in their overall length, I feel that they would have presented the student with novels that had much greater interest value in them and as a result we would have been willing to read the additional pages due to the high interest value of these two stories.  In ""Little Dorrit"" there is a character by the name of Mr. Merdle, who bilks people out of their money with his Ponzi scheme.  There is a modern day counterpoint to Mr. Merdle who did pretty much the same thing.  These novels may have been written during the 19th century,  but they still very relevant to our present day society.
Every child in high school should be reading both of these novels as part of the curriculum.",1389830400,,2651,4.498956158663883

In fact, it included some brief scenes that were not on the video tape I previously owned. Although I love this production, I knocked one star off because I just couldn't like Paul McGann as Eugene Wrayburn. Dickens' Wrayburn is an immensely complex character. Outwardly, he is gloomy, snobbish, and apathetic. But deep within, he has a compassion for mankind that Lizzie Hexam comes to see and admire. But, in this production, I have trouble understanding what Lizzie sees in Wrayburn. Nevertheless, the rest of the production is so wonderful that it basically makes up for this.

2313123,3,B0009PVZM8,"Like much British television after 1995, this series is underwritten and overproduced.  Settings and photography are good, but there's too much mediocre background music, which tends to drown out the dialogue.  Subtitles would have helped.  The plot and characters are not well drawn.  Of course, the plot is an intricate one, and getting it all into 6 hours was probably impossible.  But what emerges is very murky, with too much cutting back and forth between the various stories.  The occasional use of jump cuts is also quite inappropriate-- more overproduction showing off.  And considering that this is Dickens, whose forte was the creation of quirky, memorable characters, the series slips badly in many instances by failing to allow the time and ""business"" needed to establish the characters.  Jenny Wren, the ""Doll's Dressmaker,"" for example, is justly one of Dickens's most famous creations, but, despite the valiant efforts of the actress who plays her, the film gives only a faint notion of her marvelous, droll personality. The only characters that emerge fully are the central ones of the Boffins, Bella Willfer, and John Harmon.  I missed a lot of Lizzie Hexam and Eugene Wrayburn's dialogue because they talked so fast.  If I hadn't read the novel first, I would have been lost, so recommend doing that if you want to watch this. It does have its moments.  The villains are well done except that one of the main ones-- the gentile loan shark who slyly uses the Jewish character, Reah, as a front-- is left out entirely. Since Reah is defined by his relationship to the loan shark, he barely emerges as a character although, again, he's one of Dickens's most famous ones.
Like many other reviewers. I think the 1970s version with Leo McKern as Boffin was much better than this one, and I wish they would put it on DVD. I wish they'd bring back the 1980s Little Dorritt with Derek Jacobi too.  The 2004 version of that is so much worse than even the 1998 Our Mutual Friend that I couldn't watch it all.",1375574400,,2016,4.794797687861272

2313126,5,B0009PVZM8,"With the possible exception of' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend is my favorite Charles Dickens novel. Both have both been magnificently produced for television by the BBC. The latter first aired as a fifteen part series in 1998 tells two parallel love stories which cross paths at the outset and later converge again in a gripping climax.
 The two teen-aged beauties about whom the story revolves are Bella Wilfer, whose good looks are matched only by her avarice and desire to marry well. The other is the alluring Lizzie Hexam, the unlikely daughter of a grave robber or, to be more exact, a waterside character who finds his living in the pockets of those unfortunate enough to drown in the Thames. Lizzie is the unwilling partner and sculler for his nightly excursions.
  One such body sets events in motion. Police identify the victim as John Harmon an ex-patriot who had just arrived from overseas to claim an inheritance--one with an enormous catch. He can only have the money if he marries a girl stipulated in the will, the beautiful but mercenary Bella Wilfer. But did John Harmon perish? Or is this an opportunity to assume a new identity while observing the capricious Bella Wilfer.
What follows is a sometimes gripping, often humorous tale that follows the fortunes of Lizzie and Bella and the men who love them. Bella is wonderfully played by Anna Friel and Lizzie no less amazingly by Keely Hawes. The rest of the cast are equally stellar and bring to life the Boffins, Eugen Wrayburn and his deadly rival Bradley Headstone, the scheming scoundrel Silas Wegg and his friend the taxidermist My Venus. And others that readers of the novel will recall like the snobbish Lady Tippins, the odious Lammles and an assortment of characters, all superbly played.",1374278400,,1767,4.863787375415282

I have always been impressed with Dickens' ability to add so much detail and history to each of his characters, and in ""Our Mutual Friend"" he takes things one step further by connecting each character in such a manner that the story comes full-circle by the end.

2313147,5,B0009PVZM8,"Our Mutual Friend is my favorite of Dickens' stories, and this film is a top-notch adaptation.  It's got everything:  comedy, drama, mystery, heroes and heroines one can easily fall in love with, colorful villains, wonderfully warm and eccentric and creepy Dickens characters with the requisite silly names, and TWO great love stories!  The acting is superb.  The director and script writer did a great job.  The locations and costumes were seedy and grimy when in the London slums & sumptuous and so gorgeous when dealing with Society:  it other words, they did a great job of bringing the time period and Dickensian England to life.

If you're dithering, my encouragement is:  WATCH IT!  Everyone in my acquaintance who has seen this series (both men and women with a vast range in ages) loves it.  The only people who might be bored are young children and those who prefer shoot-em-up, fast-paced action flicks.

My only regret is that I cannot purchase the entire series at a discounted price; Amazon requires each episode to be purchased on its own.  And I will definitely be doing so!

Another note regarding the Amazon instant video version:  after watching all of the episodes, it seems to have been edited from the original PBS Masterpiece Theater version -- the subplot of Sloppy, Jenny Wren, and Betty Higden turning the mangle has been cut.  It's a small part of the saga, yes, but this is such a sweet little love story (both romantic and filial) that I find myself feeling there's something missing now when I watch my Amazon instant watch episodes.  Their stories are not fleshed out and the characters aren't as vibrant and real and lovable, with so little time spent on them.  And in some scenes, the characters make an appearance but you have no real idea why they're there, because the backstory to explain all of this has been edited out.  My recommendation is, if you have the choice of the Amazon instant watch episodes or the full, unedited PBS/BBC version, go with the full movie.  It's longer and more involved, but everything is woven together so expertly and you'll enjoy each wonderful character even more.",1354924800,2,2134,4.8292011019283745

2313154,5,B0009PVZM8,"I have long thought that ""Our Mutual Friend"" was Dickens' richest and most romantic novel and this movie adaptation is one of the best produced, best cast and best acted period dramas I've ever seen. Whether or not you have read the novel (which, at close to 900 pages, is quite an investment), if you like this genre, you will love this movie.

I will warn you, however (hopefully without spoiling too much), that the streaming version of the movie has a flaw that was not in the VHS version.  Although I did not compare the movie to the book, I felt the VHS version of the movie retained enough of the complexity of the original story so that I knew I was watching Dickens and I knew what was going on. Somewhere in the process of going from the VHS version to the streaming version (from one of the customer reviews of the DVD, I suspect this happened when the DVD version was produced), someone took a knife to the movie to squeeze it into 6 tidy episodes.  As a result, some of the character development and story line are lost (I believe most of the cut was of one scene, a portion of which remains in the streaming version as something of a nonsequitor).  What is left are some unnervingly un-Dickensian loose ends--how exactly is it that John and Bella progress from the awkward post-ball scene to being friends, admirers and defenders with and of each other?; how do Bella and Lizzie know each other such that the invitation extended by Lizzie to Bella, on which the entire ""ah-ha"" moment turns, makes sense?; who is that odd-looking fellow with Jenny at the picnic?  The scenes left on the editing room floor are essential strands in the fabric woven by Dickens--leading me to believe that the editor must not have known the story terribly well and certainly could not have loved it as I do.

But that is a detail; this movie is well worth watching in whatever format best suits you.

That aside, I want to give kudos to Amazon for two things:

First, for providing an online streaming offering that actually works.  After experiencing frequent, inexplicable and at times unresolvable issues with ESPN3, Xfinity and Netflix, I was delighted to get through all 6 episodes of ""Our Mutual Friend"" with only one minor technical difficulty (mid-video buffering that resolved itself with a browser restart).

Second, for providing instant videos that I haven't been able to find elsewhere.  I purchased the VHS version of ""Our Mutual Friend"" through Amazon years ago and, having since ditched my VCR, waited for the movie to be released in an alternate format.  The DVD version (which I didn't purchase, thinking that my DVD player wasn't long for this world either) came out several years ago ago, and, as far as I could find, it too was available only through Amazon.  I am thrilled to find this excellent movie in Amazon's instant video catalogue! Thank you, Amazon, for continuing to be an entertainment emporium.",1316390400,2,2921,4.692759295499021
2313155,5,B0009PVZM8,"Everything about this production of Our Mutual Friend is GREAT!

1. There is the incredible novel of Charles Dickens, who is a master at creating characters who are so far removed from the average characters we watch on screen or read in a book.  And, the genius of Dickens is that he actually makes these characters real. Not only real, but interesting, intriguing, fascinating, and believable!

2. The plot of this story is something only Charles Dickens could imagine and bring together.  There is a long list of characters!  Each and every character is incredibly interesting and believable.  The lives of these characters are singly shown, but then skillfully interwoven together.

3. BBC's production is beyond excellent!  For the river scenes, a set was actually built to look like an old and rotting waterfront/wharf, with decrepid houses (shanties mostly) where many of the characters lived.  Also, the opposite was protrayed: the opulent grandeur of the upper class of London's society.  The viewer was taken inside grand houses and hotels and got to witness the gatherings of the wealthy society.

3. Period costumes and sets: Excellent

4. Script:  excellent

5. The heart and soul of any production is the actors themselves.  In this production, ALL ACTORS and ACTRESSES protraying these characters performed at Academy Award levels!(even though they were ALL British actors)

Our Mutual Friend is highly recommended!",1315353600,4,1430,5.233480176211454

Acting, directing etc is all fine, but the initial setup I have trouble believing, which seems a common problem in Dickens books, or those transfered to the screen IMO, though the troubled people of the times seem well portrayed and perhaps that was more the author's political intent? All of the recent productions of his work I've seen recently seem along to follow this pattern. Again a script issue most likely found in the book itself, so hard to 'fix' without a clever adaptation.",1302912000,,636,4.6875
2313159,5,B0009PVZM8,"This is a superb book-to-film adaption of Charles Dickens' work. The film follows a huge cast of characters, most of whom will in some way be connected, from the heights of London society's most successful to the depths of the abysmally poor waterfront district's inhabitants. As with people, these characters range from very to marginally to not very complex; from good, to bad, to somewhere in between; from likable to unlikable; etc.

When a large fortune goes unclaimed by its intended owner -- who was found dead under mysterious circumstances -- society is aghast to discover that this astonishing wealth is set to pass to a ""dust man"" and his wife. Innocents are haunted by unspoken accusations of murder; the intended of the dead man sees her chance to escape lower-middle class drudgery vanish; and the ""dustman"" and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Boffin, must begin their long journey into acceptability by society. This is the backdrop against which most of the story takes place. Cue in the mysterious stranger's arrival, the sinister employee who discovers a long buried will, the machinations of scheming, but moneyless, nobles, the romantic scheming of a bored, selfish man of society, the daily trials of the forgotten poor, etc., etc. -- and you have a true Dickens masterpiece.

The acting in this film is superb. From the Boffins to John Rokesmith, from Bella to Eugene Raybern, Mr. Headstone to Riderhood, Lizzy to Bella's family, etc., etc. -- they are all beyond excellent. The secondary characters as well as the primary play their parts to perfection, painting a tapestry of intrigue, deception, villainy, desperation, honesty and love that is delightful to behold.

The disparity between the very rich and the very poor is illustrated in stunning color photography, and the cast is near-perfect.  The story of the drowning of John Harmon, and the vast cast of interrelated characters it affects is fascinating to follow.  Timothy Spall gives perhaps his finest screen performance as Mr. Venus, the bone articulator, and Peter Vaughn as Mr. Boffin has created a classic Dickens portrayal. Steven Mackintosh and Anna Friel excel as the young lovers at the center of this dark story.  This is a perfect film to lose yourself in, and enjoy over and over.",1288828800,6,845,4.881118881118881

I had been trying to watch SIDE 2 before I watched Side 1. I have no idea what I was thinking, but it doesn't work that way. Even worse, at the end of Side 1, I wondered if that was all. Was that the ending? Of course it wasn't. Don't stop there or you'll never see things come together. As you start Side 2, feel free to have a laugh thinking of me as I tried to start the movie at that part. Being 'lost' doesn't even start to explain it. Just don't make my mistake.

In fact, even watching it the right way, from the beginning, you have to pay attention. This isn't a movie you can watch while you sort your socks. You also put in some time before you see the gorgeous backgrounds and clothes of the rich that some of us always enjoy. You get to enjoy the beautiful heroines from the beginning. I won't try to describe the story. That has been done already and just trying to do that makes my head swim. The plot twists and turns.

I did enjoy the side-plot where 2 social climbers find out at their wedding reception that ""I don't have any  money, don't you?"" ""No! I have no money. You made a mistake marrying me.""  OUCH! What a great dilemma, and so fun to watch. Even more fun to watch as they try to recover from their mutual error.  That's just a side-plot. The 'real' story also has lots of good vs. evil, tragedy, victory, and everything that makes a Dickens novel.  Enjoy!",1271376000,6,1590,4.109677419354838
2313164,5,B0009PVZM8,"""Our Mutual Friend"" is an adaptation of Dickens' last novel, arguably one of his best. The book was filled with compelling insights and social commentary which has been well-translated in this adaptation. Through the two main love stories, one gains a deeper understanding of the hypocrisy of the upper classes and of the unbearably stuffy conventions and etiquette of the time, all of which revolve around the class divisions between the lower and upper classes. Bella Wilfer (Anna Friel) is prepared to accept a marriage of convenience, to John Harmon (Steven Mackintosh) after he returns from a long stay abroad, for the sake of money and status in society. When John Harmon is found dead, a result of drowning in the river Thames, Bella's future takes a different turn - she ends up marrying John Rokesmith, a lowly secretary, but it is a marriage out of love this time around. There are some dark secrets in this story, a sort of mystery that unravels over a period of time.

Then there is the story of Eugene Wrayburn (Paul McGann) who though poor is of noble birth. Eugene falls for young Lizzie Hexam (a very young Keeley Hawes, one of my favorite period actors, who has been in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wives-and-Daughters/dp/B000GIXLUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wives and Daughters</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Greenwood-Tree/dp/B000EBD9VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Greenwood Tree</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Moonstone/dp/B000AYELC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Moonstone</a>, among others). This romance too crosses social divisions, as young Lizzie's father drags corpses out of the River Thames for a living. The social criticism inherent in Dickens' novel is starkly and credibly portrayed in this adaptation and the cast does an excellent job in bringing this story vividly to life. An excellent adaptation that would have done Dickens' himself proud.",1266624000,2,2045,6.200704225352113

His book Our Mutual Friend delivers all of this and the movie adaptation brings it to life in a delightful 4-episode production. Romance, mystery, intrigue, tragedy, hilarity - this movie has it all. It is not for the faint of heart, however. The movie is very long and there are many threads to the story that come together only at the end.

Some viewers will find it slow-moving, but it is well worth the time. It is a movie to be savored even after the first viewing.

It is a flawless BBC production, and as usual, the BBC mesmerizes with its flowing style and you forget you are watching an historical period movie--everything is so real.

What makes Dickens stories so enjoyable and timeless is his array of fascinating characters.  Every facet of the human spirit finds a character in which to dwell.  Greed, generosity, kindness, selfishness, jealousy etc. are all embodied in different characters.  And then Dickens weaves plots and subplots with such dexterity that these characters meld together seamlessly.  But, best of all, they each get what they deserve in the end.  Those who are good have happy story endings and those that are bad, learn miserable life lessons.  It leaves a satisfying feeling that for once people get what they deserve, and not that life is unfair.

2313172,5,B0009PVZM8,"I'm a big fan of Brit Lit Films, especially the lush contemporary variety.  Our Mutual Friend was well cast and beautifully filmed. It was true to the spirit of Dickens and is a new favorite I will watch again and again. The lovely Keely Hawes is always watchable, but rave reviews go to Peter Vaughn in the title role as Mr Boffin, a dust man turned heir; and to David Morrisey for his compelling portrayal of the very unstable school master helplessly in love with rivergirl, Lizzie Hexam (Hawes). Also look out for a fantastic river character portrayal by David Bradley.

Twisting Dickensonian plot is expertly directed/edited with a satisfactory surprise ending. Scenery and costumes are gorgeous, and acting is top notch. Even my teenage daughter ended up loving it.",1241222400,2,771,4.923076923076923
2313173,5,B0009PVZM8,"Lots of fascinating characters. Lots of interesting and unexpected plot twists and turns. Storyline of mistaken identity. Distinct class divisions with wealthy society vs. river poverty. Pureness vs. wickedness teamed with obsession. All and so much more is found in Charles Dicken's final novel which is clearly a masterpierce.  In the end all of the obscure storylines are tied up into a surprising and very fulfilling ending.  This is my favorite Charles Dicken's story and I love all of them.  The characters are so distinct with such colorful names as: Venus, Sloppy,Silas Wegg, Boffin, Lizzy Hexum, Bella, Mortimor, Eugene and (my favorite)Rogue Riderhood and so many more. All centered in London around trash heeps and digging bodies out of the Thames River.  Wow! I put this storyline among the great classics because it is so richly conceived, executed and superbly acted by the talented English BBC.  Loved it, and you will too.",1238544000,3,938,5.144736842105263

2313175,4,B0009PVZM8,"The British are after all these years still in love with Dickens, and make television and film adaptations of his novels as often as they can; the visual exigencies of adapting his final novel--which include recreating both large sections of the river Thames both in London and outside of it near the middle of the Victorian century and the huge dust mounds of John Harmon and the Boffins--have meant that there have been fewer versions of OUR MUTUAL FRIEND that might otherwise have been expected. This fine 1998 four part version tackles the problems with great brio, and both the river and the dust mounds are beautifully realized visually. There's also some excellent acting in both major and minor parts: Timothy Spall particularly shines as Mr. Venus as does David Morrissey, who does surprising things with Bradley Headstone. And while Margaret Tyzack should still be displaying her inestimable skills in parts as fully worthy of her as Antonia or Queen Anne, she does seem to have a great time of it as the society gargoyle Lady Tippins.

In any adaptation of Dickens's longer works, minor characters inevitably are either marginalized or cut altogether because of the exigencies of time; yet even so, it seems particularly regrettable to lose in this adaptation Mr. Podsnap and his daughter Georgiana, and to see the parts of the Veneerings reduced so drastically. This adaptation also brings out some unusual qualities in the novel that are certainly latent within it but receive odd emphasis here. In this version the snobs seem rewarded and the undeserving poor roundly punished, in a way that really works against what was intended for your sympathies: you wind up having more pity for Bradley Headstone and Mr. Wegg than you do for their enemies. (Moreover, the upshot of Mr. Boffin's change of heart here seems to reinforce G. K. Chesterton's famous critique of it.) Still, it's such a treat to see this novel so largely realized--and to have the major themes of the recycling of everything and the tyranny of the pecking order so brought to the forefront of the adaptation--that on the wehole this is quite successful.",1235001600,2,2134,4.960893854748603

2313177,5,B0009PVZM8,"I ordered this dvd sight-unseen and was very pleased. My whole family (plus kids) watched it together. My kids (10 and 7) found it a bit hard to follow and wandered off after the first episode or two, but my husband and I watched it over several nights and loved it. If you don't know the story it might be a little hard to follow but no more than any of Dickens' usual complicated storylines with many characters that wander in and out of each other's lives. The film did a good job of including pretty much all of the story and characters and only simplified things a little. I loved all the performances, and my husband particularly enjoyed the storyline with Paul McGann and Keeley Hawes as would-be lovers from opposite  ends of the social spectrum. If you're in the mood for a solid adaptation of a brilliant Dickens story of love, loss, greed, and social commentary, buy this one! For the bargain price, you can't beat this one for entertainment as well as the interesting dvd extras.",1231372800,2,991,4.5363128491620115
2313178,5,B0009PVZM8,"This has all of the qualities of excellent BBC adaptations of classics with one very strange exception: Jenny Wren.  One of Dickens' most memorable characters from Our Mutual Friend is certainly Jenny Wren.  She is the disabled child of an alcoholic who manages to take care of herself and her father by doing doll dress-making.  She does some mischevious things in the novel and you really root for her, as well as sympathizing for her condition.  But in this adaptation they chose to have a woman play the part of Jenny who becomes an adult character.  So instead of a child who is street-wise and deals with her difficulties using play-acting like a child (who cannot play with children), she becomes a woman who appears a little like a simpleton.  It is the strangest thing I've seen in a Dickens adaptation.  Certainly this is very enjoyable production and I encourage anyone who likes this movie to read the book.  But this is a very curious way to handle this character.

Jenny Wren has been considered in various articles concerning children of alcoholic parents as well as the subject of a Paul McCartney song.

Aside from this one weird thing the production is true to the novel.  Regardless of this, it is very enjoyable.",1230595200,3,1232,4.737089201877934
2313179,5,B0009PVZM8,"This is Charles Dickens's last novel into TV series form. A very excellent portrayal of the classic book. Dickens is a treat for anyone who enjoys early Victorian British life.  This ""river"" story shows the poor and the rich side of life in London. It is a double romance and at the same time multiple murder mysteries are woven into one story. Only Dickens can make such a complicated plot and make it work so delightfully.

I've always like the Christmas story of Scrooge but I do believe this is better.  It is disappointing at the end of the 4 episode story (nearly 6 hours) only because you have become so familiar with many fun and quirky characters that you will not want for it to end.

This is one DVD worth much more than the retail cost. 5 stars and highly recommended.  Extras on the DVD provide additional information about Dickens--an interesting plus.  Make this one a Christmas or Birthday gift as well--they will thank you.",1224547200,,940,4.598802395209581

You do lose the story lines of a few characters such as Fledgby, Riah, the Veneerings, and the Podsnaps. And the Lammles, and Twemlow stories are greatly reduced but the flavor of the story is done very, very well in the movie.

In addition, there is a great amount of believable passion in the four main characters of two of the story lines.  The actors made their characters tangible and relatable.

I think it is rare to see a movie follow the book so closely and come out great.

Their performances (Headstone in particular)had me thinking it was too bad there was no such thing as a restraining order in those days!

2313189,4,B0009PVZM8,"This DVD has the entire miniseries of Our Mutual Friend.  It is a bit dark and chilling as it tells of the deplorable conditions of those living along the Thames in London of Dickens' time and of unusual happenings such as a dust (or garbage) man inheriting great a fortune and then mysteriously dying. It is so interesting it will make you curious to read the book if you haven't done so already. There is a brief overview of the book and its times at the end of the program, which is very helpful in understanding the background of the story.

The sound and picture quality are okay, but it is a double sided DVD with several hours compressed on it.  One feels as if a little of the clarity of the sound and picture has been sacrificed to get so much time on one disc.

Themes of wealth, poverty, substance, pretense, friendship, love, treachery and loyalty are woven throughout.

Anna Friel is amazing as the beautiful Belle and Keeley Hawes is wonderful as the peasant Lizzie Hexam.

I SO enjoy a hystorical period movie with these characteristics and best of all... a happy ending!

For those seeking a movie appropriate for the whole family, let me warn you that one minor character uses God's name inappropriately perhaps four times. There is also quite a bit of death and scary thematic elements. However, there is absolutely NO inappropriate sexual activity. All those involved in the ""romance"" theme are chaste and wonderful examples for us  all.

PLEASE! Watch this movie to the end! The second half is so exciting and the romance starts to play out.

Since it's based on Dickens, I was prepared to get somewhat depressed by depictions of poverty and the miserable down-trodden part of society, but this movie doesn't dwell too much on that.  The story masterfully weaves together the rich, poor, and in between, with criss-crossing storylines that get all wrapped up together at the end.  Wonderful!!  I loved Robert Hardy's character especially - I've never seen him in a role like this.

2313207,1,B0009PVZM8,"A poor couple inherit wealth in London in the 1800's, and help some poor persons. Bad persons contrive to blackmail the wealth away. Two men compete for the affections of a young woman. Another young man hides his wealth to test the girl he wishes to marry. Sounds good without the death and creepiness of the actual film.

This movie is lost in undeveloped characters, bleakness and death, becoming pleasant only at the end. I imagine the book is a little better than the film; because the reader can hurry over the dreary and linger upon the pleasant.

This film leads you on, keeps you, only by mild intrigue, which comes to pleasantness, only in the last ten minutes of the six hour film. Jumps back and forth between several somber (serious and bleak) plots, with but a few minutes of interest with Mr. Boffin and the doll-dress-making, until you are thrilled to arrive at some pleasantness at the end. The death in this film overshadows the few minutes of appeal with the Boffins-couple and the three young, eligible, women. All the suitors are without personality, except ""Mr. Sloppy"". The film does excel in perfecting the creepiness of the bad guys, which unfortunately overshadows the film. Will appeal to the crowd who like mild horror films.

The novel was written after Mr. Dickens's divorce from his wife. Mr. Dickens's great classics ""Oliver Twist"", ""David Copperfield"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" were written during his long marriage, and have much more charm.

In this film, the little brother continues to reject his good sister, after he finds out that she was right in her decision, and that she has suffered unjustly with his assistance. His character is unbelievable, a pointless scoundrel.

The idea of an older couple inheriting unexpected wealth, overcoming their lack of education, and extending kindness to many, is a good plot, which the producer failed to exploit. The film also missed the opportunity to expand upon the plot of the young, poor, simple, man who seeks true love with a crippled, doll-dress-making, girl. The doll-dress-making girl is portrayed as insane in one scene, which is inconsistent to her skill, resourcefulness, effort, and kindness.

There are some great ideas in this film from which a great film could be made; this film does not do it.

Far from the 5-star league of ""Pride and Prejudice"" 2005, 1996, & 1940, ""North & South"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""David Copperfield"", and ""Oliver Twist"".

This DVD is an excellent adaptation of what, in my opinion, is Dickens's finest book. The story begins in the pestilent riverside rookeries of Victorian London, the Ground Zero of a system where transcendence from the social and economic class one was born into was nearly impossible. As if he were lifting a piece of rotten carpet, the author exposes the dark underbelly of the class system as experienced by the dispossessed, as well as those who are newly wealthy. Dickens's heart clearly lay with those who manage to survive soul-grinding inequities with their moral compass intact. As such, Lizzie Hexam, one of the most noble characters in literature in my opinion, is the heart of the story. She is played with appropriately  understated simplicity by the ever luminous Keeley Hawes.  The other lead players are also excellent, but it is the array of gifted character actors who really bring this film to life.",1168214400,9,1104,5.231638418079096

It's all there: high drama, comedy, pathos; in short, the screenwriter does not dilute the Dickens effect.....Lord, don't we cherish him(or her) for that!

Momentary loss of sound, too. This problem went from one person's dialogue to another upon rewinding and playback. Double-sided discs should be banned because of quality concerns. I'm not sure weather my 2 Sony Players do not read them correctly, or weather this a defect in the disc. I had a similar situation with Jane Eyre (1983), BBC Warner also. I have rarely had a problem with the Warner otherwise. One episode of The Dukes of Hazzard stopped and then started again without breaking up. ***On the other hand, I have returned a Warner DVD only once.

The noblest characters seem to be the poor people. The Boffins are especially wonderful.

How well they are told, indeed, and what a tapestry is made when all the stories are put together!  It's exciting, moving, full of horror, romance and nobility, not to mention DARN good acting.

I would recommend watching the commentary before the movie to have an idea of what some of the movie themes are. (Such as the origin and definition of ""Dust Mines"" ) Also included is a commentary on how Charles Dickens gained his inspiration for his novels. This is important also in how the movie presents itself.

This movie was fascinating to me. The intricacies of the characters and the interwoven plot lines were very interesting and kept me involved until the end!

Victorian life in the 1800's was portrayed very well in this film adaptation of Dicken's Classic ""Our Mutual Friend.""

I would highly recommend this DVD version for any Period Movie Lovers' DVD library, as it is one that I will enjoy again, and share with friends.",1135987200,22,890,4.766233766233766

This BBC production is superb.  The acting is splendid.  This production keeps this rather complex story moving along splendidly.

Sit down and enjoy a ""really good show"".  You'll need some patience because the story is very involved; however, trust me; your patience will be rewarded!

2313237,5,B0009PVZM8,"I like Dicken's stories for his memorable characters. The good are so kind and innocent and the villains dispicable and rotten. This movie takes its time to develop the personalities and lives of these fascinating people. It's six hours long but you won't want to miss a minute.

Dickens' rats and angels come from all manner of social strata in turn of the century England. No one is free from Dickens scathing critique. The plots are set amidst the backdrop of an aristocracy which is collapsing under its own weight. The middle class grows and the born-rich are forced to socialize with ""new"" money. How distasteful! Even the poor are not immune to the social structure of the time; a river boatman, who dredges the river for bodies, will not let his son go to school; he must carry on the family trade, like his father did!

The casting is just right and the acting strong. Oh, the faces of these actors and actresses!  They say so much without a word spoken.  You will fall in love with the hero's and heroine's as they try to figure out what they should do.

I must admit, I like Dickens' evil guys! They are simply awful to the core. One of my favorite scenes is when Riderhood unexpectedly shows up in the school teachers (Mr. Headstone)  classroom sitting among the young pupils, sharing his wisdom. After his little lesson, he ruffles a boys hair as he leaves. I wanted to douse the poor lad's head in Lysol. There are a lot of neer-do-wells in this story who need their comeuppance.  Dickens does not fail to deliver!

The movie is filmed in London. Often dark and rainy.  The scenery and locations are wonderful. The costumes perfect. I love period pieces and this one ranks up there with the best of them.",1131235200,14,1718,4.5519480519480515
2313238,5,B0009PVZM8,"This DVD has two serious advantages over the VHS version--first off, it's in the original wider-screen format.  One of my complaints with the VHS version is that the pan-and-scan cropping had sometimes chopped off characters, or bits of them.  They are now fully visible throughout, and the camera work can be appreciated as it was intended to be.

The second big advantage is that there are several scenes in the DVD version that are not in the VHS version!  The scenes don't give us any ""new"" information, but they add to the coherence and flow of the story.  This footage was probably cut to fit American time slots, but why it was not added back onto the VHS is a mystery.

The video and audio transfers of Our Mutual Friend are quite good.  Although there are no subtitles, this DVD is closed-captioned.  In general, this DVD is of similar quality to other BBC Dickens adaptations that have been released on DVD (e.g., Oliver Twist (1999) and David Copperfield (1999)).

One reviewer below complained that 45 minutes or more of the original film are missing from this DVD.  I have no idea where he got that idea.  It must be some kind of misunderstanding or perhaps a defective copy because my copy clearly has the entire film (divided into four episodes, two on each side of a two-sided disc).  The all-important climax and ending scenes of this 351-minute production are all there to enjoy.

Once the introductions are made you can settle in for a great story with the usual Dickens themes.

Stellar performances throughout, particularly Keeley Hawes and David Morrissey.

But, that's what makes the good guys so compelling; the contrast to the low-lifes around them.  In this case both the low-lifes and the heroes  come from all ranks of society, from  ""dust men"" and river people to the social elite.  The contrasting conditions of these different classes is the real crime.

  Unfortunately, with the pace rather slow and the story line so dark, it may be difficult to get into this movie.  I almost turned it off after about half an hour.  But, I'm glad I stuck with it.  As the characters developed, I was drawn into the story more and more. It ends well also which for me is the real pay off. Charles Dickens is still a little dark for my taste, but, I found this piece very much worth the time to watch it.
