3447102,5,B001AD8FL2,"The short version of an italian masterpiece, not available in Europe. One of the Martin Scorcese's favorite movies. The original novel was a little bit boring, but this peplum capture a good feeling of events, the last month of the pagan Rome, filled with romance, action and a wonderful art direction. A must see, which deserve a good image restauration  in his original length.

3447103,4,B001AD8FL2,"Saw this movie years ago, happy I could see it again, wish it was in color, still enjoyed it as years ago!",1258243200,2,106,3.8636363636363638
3447104,2,B001AD8FL2,"When I saw the original version of the movie 'Fabiola' many years ago, it was an excellent film, so recently I wished to see it again on a DVD, which I looked for in many different venues, but it appeared to be out of circulation, until I found it in Amazon. So I ordered it. Even though some reviews mentioned it had a few cuts for the US exhibition, I bought it, and to my great disappointment I realized that, with the exception of the last sequences of Christians massacred at the Colisseum (an impressive display of realistic and wonderfully directed section of the film), the whole presentation was marred not only by big cuts but also by its unrestored images, which appear badly scratched and showing the film's age.
However, it was great to see old-time French and Italian stars as Michele Morgan, Henri Vidal, Michel Simon and Gino Cervi.
The experience was like acquiring an Old Masters painting discolored by neglect and carelessness.",1238025600,3,946,4.739393939393939
3447105,3,B001AD8FL2,"I saw this movie in the early 50's when I was in my teens, naturally I no longer remember the detailed story, just the main theme: the persecution of Christians by the Romans; especially the bloodcurdling gore in the arena near the end of the movie, and still quite vividly the execution scene of Sebastian as portrayed by the very handsome Italian actor, Massimo Girotti.  This Sebastian execution scene somehow made a strong imprint on me that I can't quite forgot it.  It even led me to suspect that I might have the Yukio Mishima Sebastian syndrome. But that is not the case; I never have the urge to want to post in a picture get strung up sexily and have arrows pierced my body like Mishima did.  I quess I just admired the artistic rendition of the scene and Girotti's wonderful portayal of a kindly handsome and sexy saint.  As for the movie at a whole, to be truthful, I don't care too much about religion, it's human foible, self-deception.  Of course, I believe there are higher beings but definitely not the way people try to make it up-it's not that simple.  And I doubt that the full or original version is better than this truncated version.  I remember somehow that there are lenghthy dialogue and soliloguy in the full version and in FRENCH, that I can do without.  I still think with $8.99 a piece, it's worth it, expecially for you living in the U.S. are spared the shipping cost of $8.98.",1237334400,2,1408,4.515748031496063
3447106,3,B001AD8FL2,"It's still sad, that we only get half of the original film, which originally was the fist impressive monumental film in the gladiator genre. Especially the beginning of the story is cut to short sequences.
What remains is still very impressive acting from Henry Vidal and Michelle Morgan, who after filming together here became a couple until Vidal's early death.
Let's hope that some day the whole original will be released in the original language with english subtitels.
It would have been helpful to know that this version was cut to half of the original lengh.
Still - good to have at least this version.",1225152000,2,609,4.809523809523809
3447107,3,B001AD8FL2,"This is a chopped-up version of the film aimed at the American market.  Some of the chopping is pretty obvious.  I would have preferred the original Italian version, which appears to have vanished from the face of the earth.  On the up side, it's a great old movie with great performances that I wanted to own, and now I do.",1219968000,7,324,4.366666666666666
3447108,5,B001AD8FL2,"I had been searching for this film for my own library for many years only recently discovering it on Amazon.com. Its a great film I first saw back in 1953. Though dated it is still an amazing film still to be enjoyed. Amazon.com were quick to deliver after I had placed the order, so much so I shall be looking back to them for future orders.",1217548800,4,342,4.196969696969697
3447109,1,B001AD8FL2,"Fabiola was a major international success when it was released abroad in 1947.  Boasting gigantic sets, crowds of thousands and a stellar international cast-Fabiola told its story of Christian martydom in 150 minutes.  With its massive recreation of the Colisseum, gladiatorial bouts, the Christian persecution.  It was a sight to behold.  In 1951 Hercules producer Joe Levine took the original film, edited it down to 89 minutes and dubbed it into English--just to get the jump on MGM's massive Quo Vadis which basically covered the same territory.  Fabiola is better in its original running time--even in black and white. This is the grindhouse version.  Beware.",1214265600,18,664,5.276190476190476
8276861,3,B001AD8FL2,Dated but interesting Roman spectacle. Photography was somewhat dim and not sharp.,1514764800,,82,5.916666666666667
8276862,2,B001AD8FL2,"The original movie is a post-war jewel, well rendered, and with good Italian studio recreation of the historical period. The European DVD versions available now in PAL are the best. But sadly, in terms of quality, there is no equivalent DVD version in Region-1 for the American Public.
AVOID this Sinister Cinema version like the plague!!! Its an inferior version and product by all measures. I was fool enough to purchase a second copy from Sinister Cinema when the first copy decomposed in little squares. But the second copy did exactly the same after precisely one year. In other words, Sinister Cinema manufactures ""Sinister Products"" that self-destruct after a year. So, don't waste your money like I did. Sadly but true, we have to wait for a Region-1 American version with the quality of the GAUMONT French version for PAL or Region-2, to enjoy a respectable version of this classic.",1492300800,,891,4.946666666666666

8276868,2,B001AD8FL2,I had read the book first and fell in love with it; so I ordered this to go with my daughter's homeschool curriculum. There is a reason why this movie is not well known; its done horribly and there are so many inappropriate things in it.  I don't at all understand how they got from the book to this monstrosity of a movie.  Can't recommend at all. I did give it one star because Sinister Cinema did a good job with the disc; I have no qualms with that.  It's just the movie itself I can't appreciate.,1428019200,,501,4.144329896907217

8276870,5,B001AD8FL2,"I first saw this film at a double-bill matinee with ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" (the old Italian film) and I was hooked.  I must have been all of 12 years old and Saturday matinee was the only time I could go to the movies unaccompanied ( I think it was 1948)! I don't know, those days are fading! Anyway, the original film was nearly 4 hour long and was butchered for US release. What a film it must be if this stub end is so good.  It stars Michelle Morgan & Henri Vidal (2 French stars in an Italian epic! Those were heady postwar days..) and the name of the director escapes me( I am getting old). It takes place just at the time when Christianity was about to supplant the old Gods of Rome.  It is full of rather remarkable scenes (they spared no expense on sets in Italy at that time) and is frankly a little hammy except for Mlle Morgan who could never overact!  I still recall how exciting it was sword fights, lions in the arena,etc. This was probably the greatest sword & Sandal double-bill ever.  The transfer in this release is not very good but is the only one available at this time and, though it has some problems is viewable, just!  Maybe someone in Italy will discover a long lost print of the whole great epic!  I just hope I can still eat popcorn when they do!!",1398470400,2,1280,4.221311475409836
