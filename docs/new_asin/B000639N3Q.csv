8037869,5,B000639N3Q,"This is a film about the friendship that develops between two lonely bachelors in 1950s rural Norway. One is a reseacher assigned to study the kitchen habits (why, I don't know) of Norwegian bachelor farmers. He is not supposed to talk or communicate in any way with his subject, the farmer, but eventually he does and thus begins the friendship.

The movie is full of subtle humor (the premise of studying kitchen habits is rather silly to begin with) and proceeds at a peaceful pace that allows the humor to (I can't think of a better word) resonate. There are a couple of memorable images (one is a shot of a wet horse) and a few of the Norwegian countryside.

You will probably like this film if you are insulted by most Hollywood productions (as I am.) No tough guys with guns, no T&A, no exaggerated facial expressions: just a story about a sane friendship with a very unpredictable ending.",1173139200,3,896,4.59375
8037870,5,B000639N3Q,"This is a mildly bizarre story of a sociological study gone awry.  You can find a more complete plot synopsis elsewhere...

It is wonderful film; it's funny, sad, and more than a little strange from beginning to end.  I would highly recommend it for lovers of unusual foreign films",1110758400,6,281,4.6938775510204085
8037871,5,B000639N3Q,"I caught this film at the Brattle Theatre, Cambridge, MA, in February 2004. I went on the recommendation of a friend on pure blind faith... not knowing anything about what it was about. I recommend you do the same: this is simply one of the best films of the past five years that nobody I know has seen -- or heard of. For some reason the DVD is ridiculously expensive compared with others, but the value is definitely there.",1102204800,6,425,4.3924050632911396
