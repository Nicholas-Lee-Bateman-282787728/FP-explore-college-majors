1396740,4,B000056BSE,"I bought this set because I enjoy the Porky's movie and 2 isn't bad and this was cheaper than buying them invidually.  If you get this, don't expect high cinema though.  They are stupid funny movies, don't require much though which is good sometimes.  These are also the films that seemingly started the whole teen gross out craze.
Anyways, if you watch Porky's 2, do not expose any animals to them because it killed my cat.  I don't know how it did it, but it did.  Must have been some wierd rays or something because one minute he was playing and next minute gone......",1069459200,4,571,4.451923076923077
1396741,5,B000056BSE,"I saw these movies back in the 1980's and they were funny then and they're funny now. The scene from pt. 1 that gets me every time is when ""Miss Ballbreaker"" is trying to tell the Principal about Tommy Turner and the girls shower, those coaches in the background laughing hystericaly and the Principal trying to keep a straight face.  That scene is nothing short of fall in the floor funny. In pt. 2 it's the whole date scene with Wendy when she pretends to be drunk. Bottom line, these movies are classic and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants or needs a good laugh.",1063756800,3,576,4.383177570093458
1396742,3,B000056BSE,"I remember seeing this movie in the 80's......... at the time it was considered more of a porno flick thean a movie......
  Porkys I- Like everyone I loved this, The Classic story diologe teen boys in the 50's being boys, looking to get laid ay just about all costs.... and has the funny pranks and stuff, someting enjoyable but not for the whole family...
 Porkeys II The NExt Day- UGH!!! I wish I never brought myself to watch this again since the 80's,,,, I was more discusted, I mean there is really as much funny pranks more talking, and the shakspere play lol I think Meat took more of a role in that section...........  and 1 thing that confuses me to this day if this movie has next to nothing or nothing at all to do wiht the bar Porkys thean why call it ""porkys""??????
  But o well we all learn from out mistakes don't we?
  dissapointing DVD!!!-I think a commintary would have done good, or deleted scens, or something other thean previews for the movie and Revenge of the neerds....
  Its a classic so but it.",1035331200,,1021,4.411764705882353
1396743,5,B000056BSE,"Porky's is most definitely the best movie of the 80's. Many of you might remember it from the shower scene in the girls locker room. Here is the story:
A few teenage friends are looking for a good time,so they decide to go to Porky's,a gentlemens club. Porky says that they can get a private room with any woman of their choice. So the friends go wait for them in a dark room. They are anxiously waiting for the girls to arrive. But what they get is a trick from Porky. He pulled a lever and they end up in cold water. So now,they are trying to get even with Porky.
Well,I would tell you more,but I'm afraid that I would just be giving the movie away. So,that is all that I will tell you about Porky's.
Porky's 2-The Next Day was another good movie. Here is what it is about:
A protest is being used against a play because an Indian is playing the white girl's boyfriend in the play. So then,the friends are working on getting rid of the protestors and solving these problems.
These are two very awesome movies. If you need to add something good to your DVD collection,then be sure to get these two classics.
Peace Out.",1035244800,9,1119,4.283018867924528
1396744,4,B000056BSE,"Before John Hughes put the sensitive teen film on the map, Bob Clark led another teen revolution in 1982 with his release of Porky's. Based upon his ""real"" experiences as a teen growing up in the 1950s, the film grossed a staggering 105 million in US rentals and secured its place as one of the most successful comedies of all time - it came in second to Tootsie that year. This DVD release restores the film to its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and provides a rich new print for future generations to enjoy. While not the first film in the teen gross out ""genre"" - it was certainly a defining film, and its easy to see why. At the time it set the standard for ""gross"" far outpacing the envelope pushing ""Animal House"" in terms of bad taste. Much like the influence American Pie had on nineties teen cinema, the influence of Porky's was far reaching.
It's sad then, that the sequel wasn't quite up to par. Clark insisted that the sequel was funnier than the first in interviews at the time, adding that the sequel was dealing with important issues while still maintaining the integrity of the original. Alas, while the morality of the first film remains - this time centered around miscegnation and indecency in a production of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream (the correlation to be made between the character's defense of the Shakespeare play against the upset moral majority and Clark's defense of the original Porky's is hard to miss) - the T & A that the first film deftly delivered to the pimply masses is missing. Subsequently, the moral message makes the film more preachy than fun, and the normally acceptable carbon copy sequel strategy doesn't work as a result. However, for the low price of 14.99, the DVD is worth purchasing for the guilty pleasure provided by the original - and the sequel can be enjoyed if only as a way to pass the time until the third film (a decent third entry in the tired series directed by newcomer James Tomack) is released.",1028764800,11,1967,4.638968481375358
1396745,5,B000056BSE,"Porky's was THE movie that set the (sub)standards of the 80s teen raunch era!  I saw this movie when I was 8 years old when it hit HBO, and have loved it ever since!
Though I find many parts of this movie to be funny as heck, the antics between Tommy Turner (Wyatt Knight) and Miss Balbricker (the late Nancy Parsons) steal the show in all three movies!  From Tommy in the hole in the shower in 1, to Tommy putting the snake in the toilet on her in 2, to them making love in 3 thinking each was someone else.  Any and ALL of these scenes are guaranteed to have you ROTFLYAO!
Though the second movie was also a blast, a few things puzzle me:  It was supposed to be ""the next day"", so how did Mickey Jarvis heal from his injuries over night; and in the FIFTIES, no less?!  And also, Wendy Williams (Kaki Hunter) suddenly goes from reluctantly getting laid with Pee-Wee to his girlfriend who actually cares for him (then she goes back to picking on him in ""Porky's Revenge"")  However it shows people Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson probably aspire to in it.

1396746,5,B000056BSE,"These 2 comedy classics were, and still are, a riot to watch! Buella Balbricker's complaints to Angel High's principal about ""Mr. Taliwacker"" were absolutely hysterical! She didn't find it amusing to see the principal's and the basketball coaches'(in attendance) disregard and uncontrollable laughter over her story of ""Mr. Taliwacker's"" infamous appearance through a hole in the girl's shower room! The entire 1981 movie was a hoot to see! The 2nd film brought most of the Class of '54 back to their sex starved adventures and gags played on themselves and Balbricker, a lisping Southern racist-so called preacher, a lying governor and the Ku Klux Klan! Be sure to watch the scene in which Pee Wee's girl humiliate's the governor in public! You can't go wrong by purchasing these 2 classic movies on one DVD....quality picture and sound, too!

1396747,4,B000056BSE,"Kudos to 20th Century Fox for releasing the first two Porky's films on one DVD.  (We're still waiting for ""Porky's Revenge"") Set in Florida circa 1954, the original film has fun loving guys from Angel Beach High knocking heads with Porky, the mammoth sized proprietor of the raunchiest brothel in the Florida everglades.  After being robbed and humiliated by Porky (and Porky's brother, who happens to be the sheriff), the boys learn how sweet revenge can be.  Besides peeking at beach bunnies, one boy deals with his abusive father and his own anti-semitism, while another makes it his mission in life to ""get lucky"".  The gang returned for ""Porky's II: The Next Day"", where they barely has time to savor the night before when the KKK, the crooked city commission, and a lying politition try to but the brakes on the Angel Beach High Shakespeare festival ""because it's dirty"".  The sequel is toned down with more of a social commentary. Not bad, but things picked up speed again with 1985's ""Porky's Revenge"".",983836800,2,1010,4.848837209302325

1396795,4,B000056BSE,"After recently revisiting all three Porky's movies as an adult, I can say that without a doubt that the original Porky's is still the best of the bunch. Porky's Revenge comes in second and Porky's 2 is a distant third. It's pretty clear that director Bob Clark told the story he wanted to tell in the original Porky's and the sequel was forced on him by the studio after Porky's became a smash hit. Porky's 2 just seems directionless and is surprisingly dull (with a few funny bits popping up). Porky's Revenge brings back the more absurd situations, goofy sex related humor and the dangerous redneck club owner Porky himself (a character completely absent from Porky's 2). These Blu-ray transfers look and sound great, and all the naked flesh is as clear as it has ever been since the original theatrical releases. The Porky's movies personify what made 1980's teen sex comedies so popular in the first place, and this Blu-ray double feature is definitely worth picking up.",1491609600,2,974,4.803571428571429

They went cheap on the one, yes, it is Blu-Ray disk, but you get nothing in the way of Blu-Ray quality, like picture or sound.  The picture is no better than a DVD, and the sound is not DTS, or anything close, in fact, it may be mono.  What they did was use the Blu-Ray disk to get more space to squeeze two movies on to it instead of using two disks, talk about cutting corners!  Even the case is cheap, it fell apart as I was trying to get the disk out!  I would have been better off just buying two DVDs.  This is one product I wish I could get my money back on.

Revision to the review date 7-30-17.  Last night I watched Porky's Revenge, let me change my statement about the picture quality, it is not as good as a DVD, in fact, a VHS tape would be better.
