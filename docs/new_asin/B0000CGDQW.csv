7999508,1,B0000CGDQW,"I was looking for some videos to supplement a class that I was taking in VB.Net. I tried to like this video, but I couldn't. In this series, Rick Dobson lectures from his desk. His voice is so low that you have to turn the volume way up to hear him. But then, BAM!!! You are hit with extremely loud music every few minutes! The sound mixing for this DVD set is the worst that I ever experienced.

I could only tolerate about an hour of this torture before I finally gave up on it.",1104019200,2,480,4.052631578947368
7999509,1,B0000CGDQW,"I make a mistake buying this DVD. First the sound and video quality is very poor, second the teaching method, confusing arguments and statements make me stop before finish the course. I'm very disappointed.",1101772800,,206,5.088235294117647
7999510,3,B0000CGDQW,"Think of this as a City College-level class, but subtract all ability to communicate back to the instructor for any clarification.  I'm not knocking City College - I've taken many courses at them so I know of what I speak - but a formal university education it is not.  The same applies to this DVD set; you will learn the subject matter but other education sources yield a higher-quality outcome.
As many others have noted, the sound quality is horrid.  Compare it to making an internet phone call using nothing but a cheap mic attached to your web-cam; sounds like he is talking into a soup can.  You're also hit with annoying transition slides - loud & weirdly timed slides - where after jolted by the volume shift, you sit and look at them for what seems like forever.  Too bad the same length isn't applied to the informational slides; those are usually presented without enough time to read half of it.  I spent a lot of time on the pause button, greatly extending the ""1 hour"" lesson window.
The instructor also presents in a way that makes you wonder if he rehearsed at all before creating the Final Take.  He also makes a few verbal ""typos"" which can make you need to rewind to figure out what he actually meant.  The labs could have been better structured; you are referred to the slides (included PDF Files) for complete instructions, but the slides present minimal information and are in a quasi step-by-step rather than a goal oriented format; many times you have to look at the solution just to figure out what the problem was. And lastly, the source code, although on the DVD, is not clearly organized and the instructor never clearly tells you where to go to load whichever demo solution he is working with.
There is little doubt the instructor knows the language and the environment. And you will take away a decent beginner's grasp of VB.NET programming.  But is this presentation better than a book of the same goal?  When you take away the common content elements from a DVD- and a book- presentation, the DVD set begins to lose ground in that a book is easier to reread confusing sections than the DVD is to replay, and when all is said and done, the DVD doesn't provide you with a reference guide at your finger-tips to utilize.  The DVD approach is a good idea, and worth the view, but go into it knowing this might not be your last learning purchase.",1086134400,8,2374,4.549295774647887
7999511,2,B0000CGDQW,"I waited for this with exitement, but was disapointed when I opened the package and played the DVD.
The voices was low, just like the teacher was talking into a bucket (think they compressed it too much) a metallic sound. Between the teaching it was an ""music"" that was just like an alarm bell, that was really hight volume. May the purpose of this is to wake up the student??
This made it really hard to follow the classes for an foreigner. But it was ok  when you saw it a couple of times and understood what he was saying.
Cheap, but not really good",1084924800,,552,4.257142857142857
7999512,5,B0000CGDQW,"Greetings fellow developers,
  Once again DV Press has produced a solid title that satisfies the .Net needs of the development community! If you are brand new to VB.Net this DVD is for you. The product also has enough information in it to be quite useful for more experienced developers as well! I personally found the event handling, conditional code compilation, and a few other key areas to entail some knowledge that I did not previously have.
  IF YOU WANT TO LEARN VB.NET, ""CONGRATS"", BECAUSE YOUR ABOUT TO!
Best Wishes,
Sincerely,

7999513,5,B0000CGDQW,"This DVD is for begginers and intermediate Visual Basic users.
You'll learn more then just basic things. After going through all the lessons you'll be able to program a real life applications. The most important thing is not to skip any lesson because in each one you'll find some great tips. I have programed more then a few application but some of the tips were very usefull even for me.
DV Press has done a great job on content presentation. Rick Dobson's style of presenting material is superb. There is NO book that could explain this material better then this DVD.
I can't wait to get my hands on upcoming ASP.NET DVD...",1080345600,,626,4.598214285714286
