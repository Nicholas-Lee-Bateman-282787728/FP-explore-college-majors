1339527,3,B00004CX4O,it's a good solid suspense movie.  too much unnecessary nudity.  Yes I did say that.  It's just naked people walking around left and right for no apparent reason.  And not the good nudity either Lol  solid movie just be aware of the nudity if you are watching it with younger people.,1485561600,,283,4.470588235294118

1339529,5,B00004CX4O,"Compelling story and very good acting by both actresses, especially Jennifer Jason Leigh.
I think if this were made in the 1950's or 60's , Bette Davis and Joan Crawford would have suited these roles.
I really enjoyed watching this.",1485388800,,232,4.825

1339540,5,B00004CX4O,I saw Single White Female in theater in 1992 and remember it being very entertaining and somewhat racy. 24 years later the film holds up well to the test of time. Don't expect Shakespeare and just enjoy the ride. The other movie that came with it was also entertaining as well.,1470787200,,277,4.450980392156863
1339541,5,B00004CX4O,"This is an awesome movie!!! This movie is still relevant in today's time!! Get to know people before you allow them in your personal space.

I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone! But I will tell you it is a great movie to watch and own!! There are so many people who have had a stalker like this around them!! People play nice, but come to harm!! If you like twisted movies you will love this movie!!

Many people don't come to you to help you or be good friends with you. Many come to seek, fish, destroy, vampires is what i call them as they try to take over your life!! Just as in this movie!!

I had very similar things from this movie happen with an in law... She copied my hair style, shampoo,  car, toe nail, finger nail color, career, degrees you name it!! It became sickness to watch and even be around her!!! I had no clue she was in any way a psycho!!!

She moved in with my husband and I before I knew how she really was. She played the role of christian, caring, coming to help individual. She brought her husband and children as well. And it was a night mare!!!!! She went through my personal belongings etc. This movie is a reminder to becareful of who we allow in our personal space..

We all see things that someone has that we may like, but it is psycho when you want to take over their life!!! And of course she sees nothing wrong with what she did!! I did not even know I was in a competition, but I was and I did not even know when the race started. She also tried to turn everyone against me.

I now own several copies of this movie, and I tell everyone to becareful who they allow in their personal space!!

Stalkers are real!! And they come in as helpers, friends, caring, loving, etc!!

It would be nice to see a current version of this!! The hand that Rocks the cradle is another good movie along these same lines!!

Ignore the negative reviews!! You will enjoy this movie!! oldie but goodie!!!",1470355200,,1926,4.209239130434782

1339568,5,B00004CX4O,"One  has  a  plot  to  take  over  a  friends  lively  hood.  Watching  this  movie  I  did  pay  close  attention.  A  scene  in  the  very  beginning  of  the  movie  2  twin  girls  when  they  were  little  could  prove  they  were  related.  I  can't  say  if  it  was  supposed  to  be  the  same  ones  that  became  enemies.  But  theirs  really  no  actual  proof  of  it.  You  know  what  part  of  the  movie  I'm  talking  about?  One  of  them  was  looking  at  stuff  &  saw  a  picture  of  2  girls  at  infant  age.  Whether or  not  they  were  sisters  we'll  never  know.  All  I  know  was  that  Allie  told  Hendra  at  the  end  of  the  movie  is  that  we're  not  sisters  anymore.  These  2  meet  after  one  girl  feels  necessary  to  search  &  find  a  roommate.  So  Allie  (Bridget Fonda)  finds  the  one  she  thinks  is  okay.  She  introduces  her  to  her  boyfriend  &  the  2  do  everything  together,  they  go  shopping,  wear  the  same  clothes,  &  then  after  a  while  Hendra  (Jennifer Jason Leigh) gets  herself  a  makeover  to  look  like  the  other  one,  now  they  look  like  twins.  Wasn't  a  bad  idea.  But  I  think  Allie  was  right.  She  should  of  asked  first.  What  can  you  expect  when  someone  wants  to  have  something  in  common  with  you?  Too  much  as  a  matter  a  fact.  She  becomes  sneaky  &  borrows  a  little  bit  too  much.  &  also  destroys  Allies  &  Sam's  future  wedding.
Just  when  it  looks  like  they're  going  to  live  happily  ever  after  that's  when  we  start  seeing  some  strange  behavior  from  Hendra.  &  before  too  long  Allie  becomes  a  hostage.  Hendra  hugs  &  kisses  Allie  even  after  she  becomes  dangerous,  acting  like  she  still  loves  Allie  &  that's  she's  still  her  friend.  All  Allie  can  do  is  try  to  escape  the  plot  &  the  terror.  One  of  the  things  she  does  while  being  tied  up  in  a  chair  is  turning  up  the  TV  to  get  attention,  so  that  she  can  tell  someone  the  desperate  need  of  the  situation.  Well  that didn't  work!  She  almost  pulled  it  off.  But  not  quite.  I  will  call  the  movie  half  drama  half  horror.  About  like  that.  The  terror  doesn't  kick  in  right  after  the  beginning  of  the  movie  that's  why.
The  only  way  for  Allie  to  escape  Hendra's  grasp  is  through  a  brutal  confrontation  between  the  2.  Alright!  This  movie  does  lack  a  little  action.  But  it  finally  starts  getting  interesting  during  the  last  45  minutes.  I'll  leave  it  at  that!",1454198400,,2613,4.27511961722488

1339611,5,B00004CX4O,"This is one of my favorite suspense films. The setting is amazing, an old spooky apartment building but a gorgeous sparsely furnished apartment within. The main character Allie Jones, is looking for a new roommate and finds the plain & awkward Hedra to move in. Soon strange events occur, at first innocuous but later horrifying, as Allie learns  more and more about her roommate's past. An obsession with both Allie and her boyfriend develops.  Allie's puppy and good friend are also involved as Hedi metamorphoses 'into' Allie to discard her own troubled past. The climax of the movie is suspenseful, and the aftermath calm yet tainted. If you watched this in the 90s and liked it, I would recommend buying it and looking closely at all the nuances and details-it's a well-made film.",1425340800,,785,4.894736842105263

1339613,3,B00004CX4O,"Single White Female sees the main character, Allison Jones as a successful software designer in New York City, engaged to her fiance, Sam Rawson. Their relationship suffers greatly when Allie discovers that Sam recently slept with his ex-wife, causing her to kick him out of her apartment.

Seeking companionship following this mishap, she advertises online that she's looking for a new roommate (Craigslist before it was cool I suppose) and the ad is eventually answered by Hedra Carlson. The two initially bond greatly and Hedra considers Allie like a sister after her twin sister died at birth. At first, things seem well between Allie and Hedra but as weeks go by, Hedra becomes overly attached to Allie and tries to force herself into her life in any way possible.

It doesn't stop there either. Soon, Hedra begins begins picking up Allie's mannerisms, then she gets a haircut like hers, then she tries to steal Allie's fiance. Allison soon grows tired of Hedra's overbearing, obsessive ways and gently tries to brush her aside and get her help. Hedra thinks Allie is trying to get rid of her; and with Hedra being in such a taking mood, the next thing she takes might just be Allison Jones' life.

Overall: I don't have a whole lot to say about this Single White Female. The acting was nicely executed but the movie plot itself was just sort of meh. This movie is a thriller but it really failed to pull me in with any kind of standout thrills. The suspense was there at times and other times, not so much. One positive about this is that Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a cool psycho. She's not the clueless psychotic character that you see with so many females in these obsessive thrillers. She's the manipulative psychotic character and that makes her dangerous. Overall, Single White Female has a standard plot with plausible performances but that's about it.",1424476800,,1864,4.8006230529595015

1339655,3,B00004CX4O,"SINGLE WHITE FEMALE is a highly suspenseful movie about an unfortunate young woman's psychological breakdown, or it's a glossy slasher movie starring two of Hollywood's best young actresses or maybe it's both at the same time--or perhaps it's the clever and well-acted thriller for its first hour before resorting to the routine shocks of a cheap horror flick.

However you look at it, there's no denying that this is a dynamite showcase for Jennifer Jason Leigh as the roommate from hell who becomes the bane of Bridget Fonda's existence. First she picks up Fonda's mannerisms, then starts to borrow her wardrobe, cuts her hair to resemble Fonda's, and even ""borrows"" her roomie's boyfriend(Steven Weber) for a deceitful night of lovemaking.

By that point Fonda's totally freaking out (wouldn't you?), and, well, that's when the whole thing gets a little too silly. Still, this is a nifty little shocker, and director Barbet Schroeder brings more intelligence and style to the material than it really deserves. Add that to the fine performances by the battling roommates and you've got a movie that will make you think twice before inviting total strangers to live with you.

From there on, things simply continue to go from bad to worse when Allie's new roommate wants to borrow a few things-like her clothes, her boyfriend and her life.

This suspense flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 19 going on 20 years old in my Sophomore year in college when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1992 when George Bush, Sr. was president & we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1992-1993.",1390780800,,1638,4.839285714285714

 Recently parting for her fiance, Alison Jones advertises for a roomate and gets Heddy, a seemingly ideal partner with a tainted past full of lies, madness, and morbid sexuality only hinted about. They are oposite as night and day. Alison is a successful business woman with great poise, a sophisticted wardrobe and haircut, and seemingly a well-rounded individual who is afraid of being by herself and is still hung up on her old love. Heddy is a mysterious stranger who rolls into her life, seemingly the helpful and compassionate friend. As it turns out she is anything but and little bits of information is thrown in through the POV of Alison. Slowly this is discovered, which leads ot a pretty interesting (and somewhat unsettling) revelation about the roomate in questions. We learn what she learns as she learns in for the most part. However, we did end up seeing some shots through Heddy's eyes alone, and are left knowing something Alison does not yet. This, of course, makes us more on the edge of our seat, wondering when, if, and how she will discover all of these secrets. And of course we wonder what the hell Heddy is really all about and how the movie will end.

 It begins well, pretty erotic and with a revelation that turns Alison's love life completely upside down and inside out. We then see a fleshing out of all characters involved, become intrigued by the two main leading ladies, and enjoy some nice drama and cruelty here and there. How would YOU react if the person you're rooming with suddenly starts taking over your life?

 Heddy is well-rounded out; we see her dark side, her sexual side, her sweet side. In some ways we feel bad for her and other ways we hate her. The deaths are made up to be that when they hit, they affect us. We learn to care about the characters or else how their deaths will impact other characters. Kudos to the director Barbet Schroeder for working this out and tugging on the heartstrings throughout.

 Some nice flashbacks on the side of Heddy that confused the audience would have been a nice addition I think. Unfortunitely those scenes are not in there and we go without.

 The dark moody colors and setting throughout the script lend to the role, adding more morbidity.

 This is more than just a drama - there is violence, death, sex, mystery, great setup, interesting extra tidbits on the side, and an awesome climax that leaves one biting their nail down to the thumb.

 All in all a nice recommendable flick - not unpredictable or very original but still interesting.",1379635200,,2661,4.694623655913978

1339688,3,B00004CX4O,"I'm not going to sit here and lie and say that `Single White Female' is a good movie.  It is a complete and total hot mess of a film and all the naysayers are legitimately correct in calling this out for being a campy disaster of a film on most all accounts.  That being said, it is a lot of fun and works thoroughly in doing what it tries to do.  Like, I really liked this while I watched it, and then when it was over I realized how dumb the whole thing was.

The film basically set a precedent for other cheap genre flicks that wanted to capitalize on the horrific idea that someone could become so obsessed with a person that they try and take over their lives; literally.  Allison Jones puts out an ad for a roommate after she breaks things off with her boyfriend only to find Hedra Carlson, a timid young woman who has nothing but room in her heart for all things Allison.  The two become friends, but it's obvious that Hedra takes their relationship far more seriously.  As they get to know each other more, Hedra becomes more and more controlling and desperate and soon the poo hits the fan and Hedra goes all sorts of bat-poop crazy.

Jennifer Jason Leigh is an actress I don't get.  I mean, the world seems to adore her, but quite frankly I've never been really all that compelled by anything she's done.  I can always see her working the character in her head and ultimately pulling off the same performance; one that is dull and completely affected.  That wasn't the case here.  I absolutely LOVED everything about this performance.  She completely nailed the mental decline and layered her character's `crazy' with enough subtlety so as to make her creep up on us just as much as she crept up on Allison.  I also have to give credit to Barbet Schroeder for directing this film perfectly.  He received an Oscar nomination two years prior for deliver similarly tense scenes in a vastly different genre (I'm talking about `Reversal of Fortune') and he does just as well here, even when the film itself dives off the deep end in that final act.  He maintains the film's intensity and keeps the audience glued.

1339716,5,B00004CX4O,"""Single White Female"" is one of the best psycholgical suspense thrillers. Debuting in theatres in 1992, the film hasn't really aged much, except for the hairstyles and clothes. The story is still prevailent today as the message here is clear: make sure you check out your roomate's past before having them live with you.
 Bridget Fonda, Jane's niece, and the wonderful Jennifer Jason Leigh (""Dolores Clairborne's"" Selena), star in this film about two young career women who move in together in a stylish New York apartment. Alley, the Leigh character, suffers from severe mental issues unbeknownst to the Bridget Fonda character. The problems Alley has becomes evident not only when she shows possession to her new roomate, but also at the point where Alley wants to take over her friend's life. A hugely suspenceful thriller that will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays one of the best villins ever in the history of films in this piece and the writing and direction is impeccable. The scenery of New York is breathtaking as well, as the film was shot in the Big Aplle in the summer of 1991.
 There is a remake of the film that was sold directly to DVD called ""Single White Female 2:, but it is absolute trash. Buy this original as it is an excellent film.
 The DVD is barebones, but it comes with the theatrical trailer, is in widescreen format, and is dual layered with both full and standard editions.",1241740800,,1441,4.733067729083666
1339717,4,B00004CX4O,"Here's another film I really enjoyed on the first viewing but lost its impact  on subsequent viewings.

This interesting story was quite a topic of conversation when it came out 17 years ago. By now, it's probably considered fairly tame, and nothing that shocking or special. Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh star with Leigh getting the juicier role as the wacko, ""Hedy Carlson."" Character studies of people like her are usually entertaining. Leigh has made a career of playing totally immoral women. She also shows a lot of skin in this movie, something else she likes to do in her films.

Fonda's character, ""Allie Jones,"" is no Mary Poppins, either, or should I say Fonda isn't exactly Shirley Temple. The movie shows several scenes of her having sex with her boyfriend.

The movie starts building its suspense about halfway through when Leigh - the roommate and admirer of Fonda - begins to lose her girlfriend to that guy....and decides to do something about it.

There really isn't a lot of violence in this movie, mainly just at the end. It's a good suspense movie, though, which builds and builds. Tha's why I gave it four stars because it does keep your attention, big-time, if you've never seen this movie.",1240531200,,1222,4.8

Her career as a fashion designer is  taking off and she shares a spacious, rent controlled apartment with her boyfriend Sam (Steven Weber). Allie tells him that he is the best thing that ever happened to her. Her perfect world is shattered one night by a wake up call from Sam's ex wife. It turns out that Sam is still sleeping with her and hiding it from Allie. Devastated she breaks up with him and kicks him out of their apartment. The next day she begins the search of finding a replacement roommate. She interviews a half dozen women but finds them all to be a little odd. None of the other candidates had anything on what comes walking through Allie's door next. Her name is Hedra (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and even though she is attractive she is painfully shy whereas Allie is more outgoing. Allie feeling a little bad for Hedra rips up all the other applications and offers this mystery woman the apartment on the spot. She tells her how she came to be looking for a new roommate and Hedra cautiously asks if there is a chance that Allie might patch things up with Sam causing her to be left all alone and in need of a new place to stay. Allie assures her that that isn't going to happen and the two women get settled in. Things start off innocently enough with the two women moving in furniture and admiring each other's jewels and antiques. Allie starts to notice little things about Hedra  that cause her to become concerned. Hedra is always nervous and on edge whenever Allie is in her room and she confides to Allie that her twin sister died during birth. Things start to get weirder when she notices that Hedra is copying her wardrobe and even gets a makeover complete with a hair cut that makes her look identical to Allie. Sam finally contacts Allie after several failed attempts and Allie is disturbed to hear that Sam has called numerous  times and even sent Allie letters which she never knew about. Suspecting Hedra of intercepting them she goes into her room and discovers why Hedra is so nervous whenever Allie is alone in her room. She finds tons of incriminating evidence that reveals that Hedra is definitely not who she says she is and  has been lying to Allie the whole time. The film is pretty suspenseful and darkly humorous.

1339726,3,B00004CX4O,"Single White Female is a pretty decent early 90s horror-thriller. Although most of the action and dialogue seems kind of cheesy now, I'm sure it was surprising and intriguing at the time.

Jennifer Jason Leigh really creates a psychologically frightening character that definitely increases the scare factor of the situation overall. Her character is scary to think about and very well developed in her portrayal of psychoses.

The amount of nudity and sexuality involved in this movie is kind of amazing. Every 10 minutes either Jennifer Jason Leigh or Bridget Fonda is getting out of the shower and walking naked across the apartment, or there's an extended sex scene between Bridget Fonda and her fiance. We can either say that the premise of stolen identity crosses into the most secure areas of our lives, like our sexuality, and that we are naked before these terrors... or we could just say that sex sells thrillers when plots are lacking.

Either way, Single White Female is obviously from the 90s and the clothing is the most obvious reminder of that, although Fonda's haircut is a dead giveaway too.

The DVD doesn't have any special features, except for a theatrical trailer, so that's kind of disappointing. But it helps remind you of the early 90s.

The basic plot is that Allison (Bridget Fonda) gets a roommate for her Manhattan apartment (has anyone ever seen an apartment this large in NYC??) after her skirt-crazy live-in lover Sam (played by ""Wings"" star Steven Weber) runs around on her. It's Headra ""Hedy"" (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the rescue!

Allie thinks she found the best thing since sliced bread in Hedy. Although she is somewhat meek, and no fashion magnet she seems kind, and eager to befriend the lonely and hurt Allie.

Sam reenters the picture which really ticks Hedy off. You see, Hedy is actually a kook that is infatuated with Allie. She soon starts dressing like Allie, and acting like Allie. And Allie soon finds out that Heady has some dark secrets.

When Sam comes back from a business trip Hedy goes to his hotel posing as Allie (she cut and colored her hair the same color and style) to perform oral sex on him. Once Sam figures out it's crazy Hedy he tries to get her off him.

FUN FACT: Bridget Fonda was in another movie that came out a month after ""Single White Female"" called ""Singles",1150502400,,1385,4.582995951417004
1339730,5,B00004CX4O,"While this movie is enjoyable due to the fine acting of both Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda, not to mention the supporting cast, other reviews have barely touched on what I think is a central subtext of the film: the fact that we live in an increasingly anonymous society, and this anonymity fills us with anxiety and loneliness.

  This film was one of an entire genre of films of the late 1980's and early-mid 1990's which all had essentially the same theme - ""You can't trust strangers"".

  Why did these films sweep the nation? Of course, from a purely business point of view, one successful film like ""Basic Instinct"" begets a series of imitators because the studio execs think they've found a formula for selling theatre seats and DVD's (or, formerly, videotapes).

  But every once in awhile, a ""formula"" comes along which is highly successful because it taps into an issue which is on the minds - in in the backs of the minds - of many people.

  Urbanization, itself, is only one of the interrelated phenomena which have led to an increasing sense of anxiety regarding strangers. We have also become a ""televised"" society in which many people actually experience intimate, yet entirely fantasy-based, relationships with fictional film and television characters, relationships in which they may pardoxically experience more intimacy (however unidirectional and unreal) with actors on a screen than they do with the three-dimensional people around them. Furthermore, not only are we more urbanized, we're more mobile. Traditional ties to families and small communities have been radically compromised - in fact, this is one of the reasons for the resurgence of fundamentalism in the US and elsewhere: religious fundamentalism is an attempt to recreate a sense of community, however regressive it is in many other ways.

  In any case, this film reflects the anxiety of people living in a world where we are FORCED to let strangers into our lives out of economic necessity and the ""thrown-togetherness"" of modern urban society.

  Hedy is such a powerful character because, even though she is the ""crazy"" in the film, in many ways, her distorted sensitivity and fantasies of sisterlike connection are the cry of that wounded place in so many of us - that is, the fact that we yearn for real, intimate connection with each other but find that such connection is rare or non-existent in our lives.

  Intended or not (and I would guess it was intended) the scriptwriter and director have made every other character in this film except, possibly, the upstairs neighbor in some way or another guilty of fundamental selfishness and uncaringness. Even Alison (Ally? Allie?), who at first glance appears to be a reasonable and kind young woman, doesn't hesitate to attempt to throw Hedy out as soon as she decides to get back together with her boyfriend, who, in turn, had betrayed her earlier. Then there is the entire issue of Alison's contracted employer who - well, for those who haven't seen the film, I won't go into this. But he is clearly selfish, as well.

  In any case, I think this movie rises above many of the rest of the ""dangerous stranger"" genre not only because of the acting, but because the character of Hedy, as frightening as she is, is really a reflection of something that is true about most or all of us - not that was are violent and destructive, but that we are all wounded deeply by the Anonymous Society, and  we all, or most of us, yearn for a depth of connection that simply isn't possible for most people in a mass, urban, mobile social context where the slow pace of life that once sheltered and nurtured our social interactions has largely broken down.",1133654400,,3693,4.842356687898089

For those reviewers who say the film is let down by the final half hour I have to say: pah! That's the best part! The half hour climax where Ally (Bridget Fonda) desperately fights off a now totally psychopathic Hedra (Jennifer Jason Leigh) makes the film in my eyes. The basic film premise is this: Allys live-in boyfriend cheats on her and is shown the door, not used to living alone, Ally advertises for a room mate, enter Hedra, a shy quiet librarian. The two become friends but Hedras envy and awe of her new best friends style and beauty leads her to begin to emulate her and become her twin (the reason for her obsession is revealed in full in the film but I won't spoil it for those who might want to see the film). When Ally makes peace with her boyfriend and wants him to move back into the apartment, Hedra grows jealous and incredibly vindictive at being asked to move out and begins to become obsessive, culminating in her offing a few characters (including one hapless soul having a stiletto stabbed through his eye in a very original and memorable murder scene). The final battle between the two ladies is nothing short of gripping, and the scenes incredibly convincing as they wrestle, shoot and stab their way through the apartment complex in an edge of your seat fight for survival finally ending down in the creepy shadowy basement in the belly of the building. A slew of these type of psychological thrillers followed after the success of this film (The Crush, Deadbolt, The Babysitter, Mothers Boys, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle etc) but none besides the latter of course being up to SWFs standard. High points of the film include the creepy somewhat infamous scene where Hedra emerges from the hairdressers, her hair cut from long and dark to short and auburn in an exact imitation of Allys, and Hedras violent disposal of a newly bought puppy that won't come to her. The film was adapted from an average novel titled SWF Seeks Same but in its adaptation to the big screen became a very stylish thriller. A hit at the box office when released it is well worth seeing and is a guaranteed tense and nail biting viewing experience for any fans of a good thriller.

1339745,4,B00004CX4O,"Overall, a suspenseful movie despite some slasher scenes towards the end.  I wasn't familiar with Fonda & Leight when I first saw this so the actresses did not have any influence on my rating of the movie.  Another reviewer once mentioned that you would either treat this movie as a suspense centering on a girl's psychological problem or a typical slasher film.  After having seen it for myself, its fair to say that its overall delivery is satisfactory & deserves a better opinion.",1012176000,,483,4.795180722891566

1339748,2,B00004CX4O,"This horror thriller directed by Barbet Schroeder is fairly tightly wound with some interesting psychology around an apartment and a mnage  trois.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is the mousy, dykey new roommate (and such a beauty she used to be! almost a clone of Elisabeth Shue) interested in Bridget Fonda and Steven Weber (Fonda's semi-cheating fianc).  What we have is women's sex/fear fantasy and titillation with the obligatory ""all men are dogs"" theme thoroughly worked in.  Leigh actually says ""men are pigs,"" which amounts to the same thing, although I guess we could say women are pigs and men are dogs and call it even.
There's some male titillation as well, of course, but Schroeder is primarily interested in spilling blood and out-dyking the dykes. Fonda is kind of cute and sexy, which is why I was able to watch the whole thing.  She is, by the way, another one of those children of a star, like Liza Minelli, who would never but never have made it except for the family's stardom, yet achieved a certain appeal through hard work, minimal talent, and a certain audaciousness. She can be striking in a stark, animalistic sort of way.  In some sense, her performance here anticipates her role as an America la femme Nikita in Point of No Return (1993) which came out the following year.
Single White Female was considered a controversial sensation when it was released in the early nineties because of the gross sex and violence displayed, but I suspect future generations will see it as high camp and laugh out loud at how it panders to some of our baser instincts.  The knock-down, drag-out, blood-flying fight between Leigh and Fonda near the end can be seen as hilarious in its absurdity, and kind of campish as a burlesque of Hollywood's increasingly desperate appeal to blood lust in order to sell tickets.  The crude violence and sex was moronically combined with a politically correct portrayal of Fonda as a sympathetic career girl, fighting the good fight in a world filled with sexist men and sexual harassment.  She was in effect the woman as male Hollywood hero.",980380800,,2080,4.820224719101123
1339749,5,B00004CX4O,"Okay, I'll be honest; perhaps the movie itself (especially the last half hour's plot) deserves only 4 stars.  However, Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh both more than makes up whatever shortcomings the plot  presents.  Most of this movie is a smart, entertaining, and gripping  thriller.  Bridget Fonda, as usual, gives an strong performance.  However,  it's Jennifer Jason Leigh's wickedly brilliant performance that makes the  movie.  She plays the psychotic seductress role so well that the male  audience is terrified and turned on at the same time.  One can't help but  think a star is born; too bad Leigh didn't seem to have gotten the credit  she deserves for this breakthrough performance.  All in all, this is a  pretty damn good movie.",961718400,,751,5.040983606557377

1339751,3,B00004CX4O,"Single White Female for most of its running time evolves into a truly creepy, menacing little thriller laced with moments to make the skin crawl. However all the psycholgical elements that are cleverly thrown into the  mix, get flushed down the tube in it's final half hour. Fonda, after  finding out that her boyfriend cheated on her, promtly boots him out of her  flat and takes on a roomate in the form of Jennifer Jason Leigh. At first  she seems sweet, kind and gentle natured but things start to change  dramatically as Leigh transforms from a mousy, incredibly shy introvert to  a total psychopath (to put it lightly). It seems Fonda's new roomate has  ideas of not only borrowing a few items of clothing but taking over her  life for herself completly. Both leads are convincing enough given the  rather irrational screenplay and there are times when the film has it's  inceredibly dark moments but it all ends up in typical slasher style  somewhat butchering a half well made movie.",950832000,,991,4.770588235294118
1339752,4,B00004CX4O,"This is not a particularly good film despite how awesome the plot sounds.  It involves a heartbroken Bridget Fonda befriending and becoming remates with Jennifer Jason Leigh, who becomes jealous when Bridget decides to get  married and move out.  Of course we can all relate to the jealous freind  part and have likely had simular experiences....but who wants to see a  movie about it.  However, I have to take my hat off to the makers of this  film because despite how boring the subject matter was becoming the film  managed to keep the audiences' attention through a multitude of racy  scenes.  In the beginning we see Bridget Fonda in the Buff walking around  pointlessly...later on Jennifer Jason Leigh joins in with some buff of her  own in about several different scene.  In addition there are many other  raunchy scenes that are designed to keep the audiences attention and they  work well.  So all in all I would recommend this film.",945129600,,942,4.79375

7920098,1,B00004CX4O,"This film was poorly executed based on a mediocre screenplay. This 1992 low budget B movie portrayed a shallow concept with a heartless plan to unfairly depict single females as psycho who have affection for one another while making men out to be deeply caring and misunderstood angelics. This film is a paranoid man's fantasy and take on reality. Someone recommended this to me based on my believing the film Pacific Heights to be a good roommate horror flick. It wasn't anywhere near the quality production of PH, not by a long shot. I regret purchasing this DVD. It was a total waste of money that I would have preferred to donate to the ASPCA.
