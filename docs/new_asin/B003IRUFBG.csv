4128011,5,B003IRUFBG,"Having laughed ourselves silly at The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavera dozens of times now, the anticipation for more of Larry Blamire's genius has been running high in our household. This one does NOT disappoint. What Blamire & crew did with 50's lo-fi monster movies meets its match with this treatment of the ""murderer in the big scary  house in a storm"" genre. We were floored seeing this brilliant ensemble cast come back and take such a different turn with this wickedly funny treatment, nailing/butchering every accent and leaving no hoary chestnut unturned.  This is one movie that will live in the player as much as it's in the case.  Extremely recommended.",1283126400,,659,4.918918918918919
4128012,5,B003IRUFBG,"What a pleasure this film is!  We laughed from the opening scene all the way through the last moments.  Larry Blamire's gift for ridiculous dialogue and spot on satire shines through in this wonderful send up of ""people stuck in the house with a murderer(s) on the loose"" genre.  The acting is very strong and the comedic moments (which are numerous) are played ""straight"" - which is the only way to do it!  My hat's off to Blamire & Crew for bringing yet another fine comedy together.  I can't wait for the next movie!",1283126400,18,519,4.4787234042553195
4128013,4,B003IRUFBG,"Dark & Stormy Night is a spoof of those great murder mystery type movies from the 30's & 40's in which a group of characters gather at a creepy old house/mansion of some sort, in this case to hear a will reading of a recently deceased individual. Unbeknownst to them at first is that there is a murderer in their midst and one by one people start getting picked off while the rest try to figure out who the killer is.

Writer/director/actor/producer Larry Blamire really nails the look of these type of classic old movies. Even though this movie was filmed on sound stages, the feel of the house that this takes place in is great and very authentic to that era. Big, expansive with all kinds of rooms, nooks & crannies and secret compartments for the characters to discover.

The cast is thoroughly excellent and as with Larry Blamire's 2 Lost Skeleton films are obviously having a blast. There is also some appropriately cheesy model work near the beginning involving a car going over an old decrepit wooden bridge. The musical score is also surprisingly very authentic to this type of movie.

If there is one slight criticism that I have with the film, it's that the fact that movie starts to drag in a few places in terms of the pacing. The movie is 90 minutes along and maybe could have been slightly more effective with a little more judicious editing to maybe around 75 minutes.

But that is a slight complaint. The movie is funny, immensely quotable and very well done in all respects. It might not have the immediate wide appeal that the Lost Skeleton films have, but it manages to execute its humor in a more sly manner that makes it a very satisfying viewing experience. And don't forget the willsnacks when you watch this with friends!",1283126400,9,1746,4.586538461538462
4128014,5,B003IRUFBG,"The mad geniuses who cooked up The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra can apparently do no wrong. If you know Larry Blamire's other work, you know the tone of this piece, and if you don't, you're in for a treat. Comedy fans who were unmoved by the hokey sci-fi cliches of Lost Skeleton might be more enamored with this spooky old house murder-mystery. Like Clue, Murder By Death, and other wacky takes on the genre, the laughs don't come at the expense of the mystery, which is a well kept secret until the final set piece. Unlike those others, this one has more delightful nonsense and dementedly witless wordplay than Through the Looking Glass. Classic film enthusiasts will giggle at every turn of 30s slang and chuckle at each plot device, from the creak of each secret door to the glimmer of eyeholes in the family portraits. Those less initiated (and they are few-- for example, children who have somehow never seen Scooby-Doo) will still find it funny on a more absurd level. This is a movie to be enjoyed with an audience, so gather a group together and enjoy. Don't forget to serve the ""will snacks.""",1282521600,5,1099,4.612244897959184
4128015,4,B003IRUFBG,"Being a huge fan of movies such as, ""The Old Dark House"" from 1932, with Charles Laughton and Boris Karloff,  and ""One Body Too Many"" from 1944 with Bela Lugosi, I was anxious to see how the Director would pay homage to those films and others in it's genre.  I found the movie entertaining, with lots of quick witted  dialogue, great atmosphere and a respectful spoof of the great classic murder mysteries from the 30's, 40's and 50's.  If you are a fan of more recent murder mystery movies with a comedic dark side, such as ""Clue"", ""Murder by Death"" or ""The Cheap Detective"", then you will enjoy this film.  The DVD offers the film in both black and white and in color, however, in my opinion, much of the allure and chemistry of the film is lost in the color version.  A good film overall and one that I would recommend for anyone looking for a fun little night of murder in an old dark house.",1282435200,34,895,4.3293413173652695
4128016,5,B003IRUFBG,"A new genre from Larry Blamire of Lost Skeleton fame.  It is hilarious and yet perfectly captures the old dark house movies of the 30's.  The characters are all so deliciously protrayed as perfect comedic copies of their 1930's counterparts...the strange cook, the smart-talking newspaper man and gal, the scared housekeeper, the rich dandy, the helpless maiden.  They're all there and they're all a riot!  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves Blamire's work.  It has his words...um, uh...written all over it.

So what are you waiting for??  Go ahead and order this film today....slowly....SLOWLY!

4128017,4,B003IRUFBG,"I'm a big Larry Blamire fan and ordered this as soon as it was available.  My kids and I waited with bated breath until it came.  Then we watched and laughed and mocked this genre of film that was so popular back in the 1930.  All the characters that you love in old dark house movies are portrayed, and brilliantly by Larry's cast from The Lost Skeleton series.

The only point I have against this film, and my kids agree with me, is that one of the characters really ""pushes the envelope"" if you will, past the point of acceptable ridiculousness.  Larry and the producers have always struggled with where the line is when making fun of a genre film.  I'd say they got it 97%.  The 4 stars are because I can't give 4.5 stars.

For those of you that haven't' seen them.... watch The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera and The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.  Both brilliant and wonderfully funny, also by Larry Blamire and company.",1282348800,4,919,4.455089820359281

It helps if you're somewhat familiar with this type of film, but it's not essential: this is high-octane looniness.

It doesn't help matters even though the director, in his commentary, states that ""it works in color as well"" to which one of the other actors replies ""We'll let Ted Turner take care of that"".. nobody laughed. The original ""old dark house"" movies are far better than this drivel and were a satire in and of themselves, even though many didn't intend to be. ""Ssh, The Octopus"" is heaps better than this rubbish and it runs for a merciful 55 minutes whereas this monstrosity maintains it's depth of tedium for a full hour and a half. Actress Jennifer Blair (also the director's wife according to IMDb) has the most annoying laugh this side of witch hollow. Her incessant cackle could peel paint.

Dark and Stormy Night has some great bits though.  I also really liked the ending.  I really super enjoyed the being in the locked attic room.  Not to give anything away but . . . YES !  That was AWSOME !
During the movie I wanted to strangle some of the characters my self if I could've just found the right secret passage way to their sleeping quarters.
Talk about annoying ! ! ! ! God !

4128047,5,B003IRUFBG,"I love old dark house movies like The Cat and the Canary, The House on Haunted Hill, and the eponymous The Old Dark House, and this is a very funny spoof/homage to them.

Very much like the beginning of The Cat and the Canary, the story starts with a group of people assembled in an old dark house to hear the reading of a will.  The deceased, Sinas Cavinder, was a wicked man who vowed that he would return from the grave and do ""bad, bad things"" on the very night his will was read.  It is also noted that the house itself is supposed to be haunted by the spirit of a witch who was burned at the stake and that recently there have been a series of murders by strangulation on the grounds of the estate.  Two reporters, Eight O'Clock Faraday and Billie Tuesday, have joined the party to cover the will reading and are ecstatic about the scoop they're about to get when someone murders the lawyer before he can reveal the final part of Sinas Cavinder's will.  Could the murderer be Sinas's sniveling nephew Burling, who was angry at being disinherited in favor of Sinas's ward, Sabasha?  Was it Burling's money-grubbing wife, Pristy?  Or perhaps Pristy's lover?  Or one of the creepy servants?  Is it true that there is an escaped mental patient in the house?  What secrets are the servants keeping?  And what's up with the gorilla that keeps wandering the halls and secret passageways?  As the night wears on, robed phantoms prowl the mansion, the bodies mount, and the reporters struggle to find the answers before they become casualties themselves.  And the cab driver who brought them there just wants the 35 cents Faraday owes him.

If I have any criticisms of the movie they are:
1. There are a couple of jokes that involve word repetition that get carried on a little too long (some others have pointed it out as well).
2. They included homages to quite a lot of old dark house movies in one film, and they could have saved a few for another!  (Although maybe that would be overdoing it.)

Anyway, I think the movie is a lot of fun, and even people who aren't up on their old dark house references will find it amusing (although maybe not quite as much as those who know what they're making fun of).  My request: they should do a follow-up with a mystery on a train in the style of Murder on the Orient Express and The Lady Vanishes.",1437350400,,2340,4.429906542056075

The only time I smiled (never a laugh, only a smile) was when I viewed the ""gag reel"" - a sure sign that a movie is not only an extraordinarily bad satire, but an absolute failure as a comedy.

Witty, outrageous, goofy, and silly by turns, it gives a tip of the hat to all the old movies of a collection of strangers stuck in a house together with a madman or two on the loose.  The actress (and I'm sorry, I can't recall her real name) who plays the character of Thessaly steals every scene she's in. I liked it so much, I made a Halloween costume of her outfit for myself.

It's a tongue in cheek homage to the old B&W mystery/suspense genre - and it is very deliberate in its campiness, even though it never goes over the top with it.

There's a will being read, a murderer on the loose, a phantom, a gorilla,sassy dames and shifty characters filling every awesome scene. The costumes are magnificent, the players hillarious (Personal favorites? Jim Beaver as the hunting guide and a cameo by the wonderful  Marvin Kaplan), the snappy patter by Jennifer Blaire and Daniel Roebuck, and Brian Howe's face alone is reason to give it five stars. It is one of those pictures you like well enough the first time you watch it, then love by the third viewing.

4128091,5,B003IRUFBG,"Thoroughly enjoyed this supremely silly movie. So did the family...more of a recommendation yet.

Larry Blamire has quite a small role himself, seems an after thought. Truly naff clobber.

Masterson is wonderfully hopeless as a pommie ingenue, probably later arrested for overacting. Gives lessons to soccer players, I suspect.
Most of the actors are familiar faces to us Skeleton lovers. I'm hopeless with names.

Some inspired ensemble pieces, a great script and a flow of action that mintains interest throughout.

The expected bizarre lines just keep coming, culminating in a truly Pythonesque diatribe from a mad scotswoman.(she'll always be Lattis in my mind's eye)
Inspired random juxtapositions of images conjured up.

Disappointed by the color in the 2nd Skeleton movie, I watched this in b&w from the outset. The play is done  so well I suspect that color would add little.

A couple of wonderfully boring characters. The interplay between the two journalists, (we find that ""Animala"" has a true comic gift) and its long telescoped conclusion. All spot on.

Superior script to any predecessors from this team. This really hangs together well.
And a gorilla.
And we learn that the villain(s) aren't an ostrich at all.

The best parody I have ever seen (right up there with Shaun of the Dead and Larry Blamires other Movies). This one is a take on the old haunted house/ Clue style whodunit movies. Why it works so well (in fact much better than Clue itself did) is that it has just the right balance of quirky characters and silliness put into what is otherwise a perfectly serious genre movie (ie. it never breaks character or has any pop culture references to draw you out of the plot and happenings). Absolutely great performances from brilliant actors, infinitely quotable, and endlessly fun to rewatch - Dark and Stormy Night is my favorite of Larry Blamires movies (although you should definitely watch all of them - they are all great), one of my favorite movies period, and at very least deserves for you to check it out.",1367884800,2,983,4.4972067039106145

4128105,3,B003IRUFBG,"With DARK AND STORMY NIGHT, the folks that brought you a parody of bad 1950s sci-fi THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA (which is to say Larry Blamire and his gang) take a crack at ""the old dark house"" genre--a type of story that has proven unexpectedly durable over the years, all the way from silent film to Saturday morning cartoons.  Such stories typically involve a reading of a will or similar event in a creepy and decayed mansion, where the characters are cut off from the world and are forced to deal with sliding pannels, secret passages, and a concealed killer.

DARK AND STORMY NIGHT is very specifically based on the THE CAT AND THE CANARY, a 1922 play that went on to become an extremely popular 1927 silent film and had at least two remakes thereafter.  A group of strangers have gathered to hear the reading of a will at an isolated mansion; the lights go out, the attorney is murdered and a portion of the will goes missing; the telephone is out of order and the house itself cut off from outside aid by a violent storm and a washed out bridge.  Needless to say, more murders soon follow, and competing newspaper reporters Eight O'Clock Farraday and Billie Tuesday (Daniel Roebuck and Jennifer Blaire) are hard pressed to stay on the track of the killer.  Along the way the film also includes nods to everything from THE GORILLA to TOPPER RETURNS to THE OLD DARK HOUSE to serials of the era.

Like MURDER BY DEATH and CLUE, the parody is very deliberate, and the script, style, and acting are nice riffs on the genre, and the cast contains a number of noted character actors who give it their all.  Even so, like other Larry Blamire efforts, the film seems to have trouble sustaining itself over time.  Although it only clocks in at about ninety minutes, it feels overlong--and quite frankly I think you have to be pretty knowledgeable of the genre to catch the joke.  The DVD includes a ""making of"" doc, a gag reel, a commentary (where the commentators are having a bit too much fun for effectiveness), and a color version.  Recommended, but pretty much only to fans of the style, the genre, and the Larry Blamire crew.

Once again, Larry proves he is lousy at word play; relying too heavily on double talk and repetition to gain a laugh.  Rule number one: if a joke doesn't work the first time, repeating it isn't going to help.  In one case, Larry has two of his actors repeating their dialog back and forth, like small children trying to goad each other.  It goes on far too long, to the point of desperation.  I wanted to shout, it isn't funny, drop it and move on!  Odd names don't help the situation either (Seyton Ethelquake, Sabasha Fanmoore, Burling Famish, Jr.), nor does having them said endlessly.  Sight gags, on the other hand, worked well.  Toying with the old ""Dark House"" plots also proved amusing.  Pity Larry couldn't stick with what worked instead of falling back on lame antics like a guy who had to be prompted when he couldn't think of a word for things like: chair, falling, hat.  Not funny.  Neither was having acclaimed actress Betty Garrett wander through scenes for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  At least James Karen was funny, as was most of the cast.

I loved both the original ""Lost Skeleton"" and the ""Lost Skeleton Returns"", and was looking forward to a similarly excellent take on the Old Haunted House. However, as others have said, the constant bickering/yadda-yadda between the two lead characters became irritating after a while (actually leading me to grumble out loud, ""Will you two SHUT UP?!?!?""). While Larry & Crew got a lot of this right, the overall effect for me is too much of a good thing. However, the taxi driver in search of his 35 cents is hilarious!",1302134400,,602,4.688679245283019

4128126,4,B003IRUFBG,"A bunch of random people come to a remote mansion. There's a thunderstorm. The bridge is washed out. Curses are due to hit. A serial killer is on the loose. There's a gorilla... wait, what?

Yes, ""Dark and Stormy Night"" is a spoof of those... um, movies where people end up in a remote mansion, die horribly one by one, and must figure out who is the killer. Director Larry Blamire and his usual gang of skilled actors are hilarious as they pirouette through a maze of genre cliches, although some of the gags wear a bit thin.

Several people come to the remote mansion of Sinas Cavinder to hear his last will and testament, which leaves everything to his ward Sabasha (Fay Masterson). Among them: a loopy medium, a sad-sack nephew and his adulterous wife, a safari guide, a pair of reporters, a little league waterboy, a psychotic cook, a cabby trying to collect thirty-five cents, and a gorilla. Wait, why is the gorilla here?

But there is an addendum to the will... which unexpectedly goes missing when the lawyer is killed. Also, there's a witch's curse, and old Sinas' curse, and two killers who are somewhere in the house.

Of course, a sinister masked figure starts stalking through the mansion, killing people one by one -- and every time someone is about to either reveal the killer or read the letter, the light goes out and they're stabbed. It's up to two bickering reporters to flush out the killers before they become the next victims of MURDER MOST FOUL!

Okay, ""Dark and Stormy Night"" is not quite as good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Skeleton-of-Cadavra/dp/B00020HAY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</a>, which was pure gold from start to finish. Some of the gags are a little overmilked, such as the running joke where somebody is just about to reveal the killer/read the letter... only to have the lights go out and the person gets stabbed.

But it's still hilarious, especially since there are a lot of familiar faces here -- Blamire himself, Jennifer Blaire, Dan Conroy, Trish Geiger, Susan McConnell, Alison Martin, James Karen, and Brian Howe. All of them give earnest, straight-faced performances, saying the most ridiculous lines without cracking a smile (""The frog of uncertainty danced in my head too, as they say!"").

The plot is ridiculously over-complex, with deliberately clumsy lumps of exposition and a dramatic style. And as you'd expect from a Blamire movie, the dialogue is cheesy (""You mean spend the night? In this awful house of pain and death?""), nonsensical (""How can I run a house when a man has something sticking from his back that makes him DEAD?!"") and.... just plain goofy (""I'll lance your imaginary boils!"").

""Dark and Stormy Night"" isn't quite as good as some of Blamire's other cult spoofs, but it's still... what's that word... something like funniness, but more.... HILARIOUS.

And what's with the gorilla?",1289865600,,2942,5.06198347107438
4128127,2,B003IRUFBG,"I was a huge fan of Lost Skeleton of Cadavra Cave (probably a top 10 favorite of mine) but Dark and Stormy night did not work for me. Whereas Lost Skeleton kept me laughing from start to finish, Dark and Stormy Night only ever solicited a few brief snickers. The characters were, for the most part, over done, unconvincing and annoying. It also seemed like the pacing of the humor was off; not enough time was given to laugh at one gag before another was executed. It was kind of like watching a Mel Brooks film that never truly delivers played by a group of clicky actors (like in a Christopher Guest movie where he tries to fit in all his buddies, no matter how unnecessary and detracting their characters are).

When I try to describe Lost Skeleton, words fail me. The script is genious and the characters are goofy, subtle and fully convinced. If I was asked to describe Dark and Stormy Night, I would probably say that it is simply a loud parody and that someone shoud rather rent the movie Clue instead.",1289606400,7,1009,4.454054054054054
4128128,5,B003IRUFBG,"Once again, Larry Blamire produces an absolute gem.  Along the same lines as his amazing Lost Skeleton of Cadavra, Dark and Stormy Night is a satire of the old ""Dark House"" films of the 1930's and 40's.  It helps to have seen a few of the original films to apreciate the jokes in Dark and Stormy Night.  This film is incredibly clever, very funny, and, as usual, all the actors are excellent!",1289174400,,392,4.416666666666667
4128129,5,B003IRUFBG,"Don't worry. If you don't like ""Young Frankenstein"", this movie isn't that one. Blamire and crew have faithfully studied the period films of this genre and stunningly recreated the lighting, the mannerisms (""are you pitching woo on me?""), costumes, the whole nine yards (to stay in the period references). If you didn't know better, this movie is easily mistaken for the real thing, rather than a spoof. Plus, the writing is snappy, the performances are...well, stellar is reserved for Oscar level films, and this will sadly never be nominated, but you get the idea. The actors channel actors from the 30's and 40's so faithfully that they make it seem that somehow Blamire has reached back through time and pulled real actors from the period to make this film.

If you loved ""Young Frankenstein"", then your wait for a similar movie is over. It's that funny.

A word about the video download purchase: don't do it. You are limited to only two installations. If you want a third, you have to completely uninstall the UnBox player from one computer, and download and install it on the new computer, and then redownload your movies one at a time to the new computer, a lengthy, pain in the patootie process, especially as your film collection grows. If you want a download tonight, do the Amazon rental or go get Netflix. If you want to buy, get the DVD and copy it to your hard drive if you don't want to carry your DVD collection with you everywhere you go.",1289001600,,1456,4.66147859922179
4128130,3,B003IRUFBG,"This is probably my second favorite movie from this ensemble, with ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" being my favorite. This movie is also much better than the ""Lost Skeleton"" sequel, which I didn't care for at all. Overall, the movie is watchable and made me smile a couple times. There were a couple parts that seem really too silly in tone compared to the rest of the movie, but I thought the cast did a good job.",1286928000,,413,4.376623376623376
4128131,4,B003IRUFBG,"Just a brief note about this very funny movie.  It is by the same production team that brought us the classic comedy ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera"" and the sequel, ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"",  Although those preceding films were rooted in and inspired by Grade Z science fiction films of the 50's, ""Dark and Stormy Night"" draws it's inspiration from the old-dark-house genre films of the 1930's.  Change of setting, same bellylaughs.

I gave this DVD a 4-star rating instead of a 5 because the DVD is missing one vital element (vital for me, that is:) English subtitles for the hearing impared.  It's unthinkable in this day/age for a company to ignore ANY group of people who might be intereested in purchasing their product.  It's the equivalent of buying a book you believe to be in English, but which actually contains only a few random words that do not convey . . . well, anything much.  I'm lucky I had a freind who watched the film with me and could supply the hundreds of words my faulty hearing missed.

I would like to respectfully ask YOU to consider not renting or purchasing any DVD that does not have captions for the hearing impared.  Maybe together we can convince companies to routinely make this small concession available.",1286496000,2,1250,4.723502304147465
4128132,5,B003IRUFBG,"Basically is run well; faux pas and cliches are spewed pretty heavily, but with low-key fashion, as opposed to the ""smack in your face"" style of ""Scary Movie"" or ""Epic Movie"" or...well, any movie in that vein.  Note that this is a send up of ""House on Haunted Hill"", the Vincent Price classic.  You'll find here just about any combination of situations that you've seen in mystery films over the years.  This is done in B/W, just as you would expect.  Several cast members do distinguish themselves in over-the-top dramatization, and some nice surprise performances from other members that you recognize from ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavre"", and ""The Lost Skeleton Returns Again"".  If you're a fan of either of those movies, you'll be getting this one.

If you're unfamiliar with either of those films, you may want to buy ""Lost Skeleton"" with this one, as it set the tone a few years back for these kinds of films, and it stars pretty much the same cast.

Note: if you're expecting ""Airplane!"" style humor, you won't get it.  This is geared for the audience who have endured cliches and canned dialogue in films known as grade-B, like ""Plan 9"", haunted house thrillers, ""Three Stooges meet the Mummy"", etc.  Nice to see all those gaffes in one film like this.

But I have to say, though clever, it is not nearly as laugh-out-loud funny as Larry Blamire's other movies, The Lost Skeleton of Kedavra, and the new sequel, The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.

4128137,5,B003IRUFBG,"Okay... ""Dark and Stormy Night"" is my new favorite movie.  It's written and directed by Larry Blamire (""Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"", ""Trail of the Screaming Forehead"") and it's a satire of Old Dark House horror movies.  This movie is ten times funnier than ""Murder By Death"".  I loved the movie version of ""Clue"" (sue me).  This is better.  I can't even begin to count the strange quotes you're going to be getting from me.  The dialogue is rapid-fire and brilliantly off-the-wall.  There is a love of and dexterity with language and a dearth of fart jokes.

It has the goddess Jennifer Blaire (Animala in ""Lost Skeleton"") as wise-cracking reporter Billy Tuesday.  As far as I'm concerned, she's right up there with the goddess Jane Lynch.

This also has the goddess Fay Masterson (Betty in ""Lost Skeleton"") as a British ing&eacute;nue so helpless she can't sit in a chair on her own and the amazing goddess Susan McConnell (Lattis in ""Lost Skeleton"") as a mad Scotswoman with the greatest heavily-accented vituperation this side of John Cleese as the French guard in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"".

If you like the Christopher Guest style of ensemble casting, you're going to love this movie.  Andrew Parks (Kro-Bar in ""Lost Skeleton"") is the standard issue tuxedoed British fop.  His mom, Betty Garrett (from ""Laverne & Shirley"") pops in and out of the story with her gorilla (Bob Burns.  If you've ever seen a gorilla in a 1960s sitcom, it was Bob Burns.)  Jim Beaver (Ellsworth on ""Deadwood"") is great as the deceased millionaire's safari guide (""Some of the toughest four days I've ever spent."")  Actually, there isn't anybody in this movie who couldn't be singled out - which of course is what you're shooting for with an ensemble.

I completely love Larry Blamire.  In a Non-Threatening, Manly American sort of way, I mean.  I watched the film again with the commentary track on.  His frame of reference is so like mine, it's frightening.  Who else bases a character on William Demarest in ""All Through the Night"" (a Bogart comedy that flopped because it was marketed as an action film)?

This is a movie for anyone who ever wished the ""Carol Burnett Show"" had hired the writers from ""Your Show of Shows"".
