8194102,2,B000Q3X94K,"I was looking for a DVD for a long time to learn the basics on my Motif XF8. When I started the video I was astounded because the whole thing is recorded on the OLDER version of the Motif. It's not even looking similar to the new one, whereas everything is color and bigger, i.e. totally different. I am contemplating to send this back to the seller and get an other DVD from WWW.MOTIFATOR.COM. I should have done that in the first place. Not recommended, unless you have the older MOTIF.",1437955200,,488,4.373626373626373
