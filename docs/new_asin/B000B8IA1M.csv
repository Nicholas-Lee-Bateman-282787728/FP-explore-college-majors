2408439,3,B000B8IA1M,"Being fairly uncool and self involved in the early 80s, I hadn't read any of the National Lampoon magazines at the time, so I was completely unaware of the antics (or existence) of Oliver Cromwell 'O.C.' Ogilvie and Mark Stiggs, or the fact that a movie, titled O.C. and Stiggs, based off this material, had been released in 1987.  After reading some helpful reviews of the film, I searched the internet to see if I could locate any of the original materials, and sure enough, the National Lampoon website has a detailed listing of all the stories, which I'd recommend checking out.  Based off of stories written by Tod Carroll and Ted Mann (both writers for National Lampoon), and directed by Robert Altman (MASH, Nashville, Popeye), the film features Daniel Jenkins (Glory) and Neill Barry (Amityville 3-D) as the title characters, Oliver Cromwell 'O.C.' Ogilvie and Mark Stiggs, respectively.  Also appearing is a lengthy list of notables including Paul Dooley (Strange Brew), Jane Curtin (""3rd Rock from the Sun""), Martin Mull (My Bodyguard), Dennis Hopper (My Science Project), Ray Walston (Fast Times at Ridgemont High), Louis Nye (Harper Valley P.T.A.), Melvin Van Peebles (Jaws: The Revenge), Cynthia Nixon (Amadeus), Jon Cryer (Pretty in Pink), and Tina Louise, probably best known as Ginger, the movie star, from mid 60s television series ""Gilligan's Island"".

The film, set primarily in Scottsdale, Arizona, features two teenage miscreants named O.C. and Stiggs who have an affinity for lobster, floozies, and pranks (not necessarily in that order).  The story, such that as it is, highlights their subversive activities against superficialities inherent within the realm of suburbia, their focus centering on a well to do family named the Scwabs, particularly the patriarch of the family named Randall Schwab (Dooley), their mortal enemy, who owns an insurance business, has contempt for all races but his own, and is just a real a-hole of the highest order.  The movie relates activities taking place over one summer including the boys making ridiculously lengthy long distance phone calls to Africa (on Schwab's dime, of course), crashing Schwab's daughter's wedding to an Asian man named Tang, a pilgrimage to Mexico tubing down the Rio Grande (on tubes stolen from the tires of Schwab's cars) to see their performing idol King Sunny Ade, hijacking a local theater production, hosting a bogus charity event (complete with street people) at Schwab's `incredibly stucco sterile monstrosity' of a house while he's away, and so on...along the way we meet all kinds of unique individuals like Wino Bob (Van Peebles), who happens to reside in a bush and buys the boys alcohol, Sponson (Hopper), a shell shocked Vietnam Vet who maintains a heavily fortified outpost just outside the city, Grandpa 'Gramps' Ogilvie, a former police detective who spends his days relating the more gruesome aspects of his career at the most inopportune times when he's not eating eggs, huevos rancheros style, along with Schwab's family including his perpetually drunk wife Elinore (Curtin), and his spineless, idiot son Randall Jr. (Cryer)...all of which culminates into a 4th of July spectacular the likes of which few have ever seen...

If your familiar with Robert Altman's films, then you understand the story isn't so much the heart of the movie, but rather the characters, or, at least this seems to be the case in the small number of his films I've seen, the most memorable being MASH (1970).  When it works, it works beautifully, but when it doesn't, it fails spectacularly, as is the case here...I think the main problem, besides Altman being the just the wrong choice for director for this type of material, is the fact it seemed like there were three distinctly different conceptualizations working in terms of what was expected from this movie, which, incidentally, wasn't released until a full three years after it was actually finished (apparently the studio disliked it so much they decided not to release it right away).  I think the studio was looking for a run of the mill teenage comedy, which were prevalent at the time, the writers obviously would have wanted something much closer to the intent of their original work, and Altman, who despised the teenage comedy genre, took it upon himself to present a satire of the very genre he was hired to emulate.  Subsequently, the writers, the studio, and the director seemed not to like the finished product very much (along with audiences and critics), and the movie ended up bombing abysmally.  After watching the film, I'd agree with many that the movie is a spectacular failure, but an entertaining one when viewed in the right perspective, one involving a good amount of alcohol.  Many of the characters and events within the original material seem to appear in some form or other (the script seems to borrow liberally from one, particular tale rather than the entirety), but the very offbeat, subversive, and darkly funny spirit appears not to have transferred over very well from the original material, in my opinion.  It's hard to describe unless you've actually had a chance to read the original stories, which I'd recommend, but the main characters of O.C. and Stiggs just came off as, well, mean spirited, smarmy a-holes who were almost as bad as those they were against.  One significant change was the inclusion on King Sunny Ade and His African Beats...apparently, the script had originally called for Clifton Chenier, but he was unavailable due to previous engagements, and Altman was partial to the stylings of King Sunny Ade, so there you go.  I did like the supporting, oddball characters, especially the ones played by Ray Walston, Martin Mull, Louis Nye, and I think my favorite scene involved the boys, while in Mexico with their brain dead friend Barney, running into the drama teacher and their guidance councilor, the pair, both male, apparently involved in a discrete, south of the border getaway.  All in all this is a very loose, unfocused, and seemingly poor adaptation that has its moments, but anyone looking for the a true, onscreen representation of that which appeared within the pages of National Lampoon will most likely be disappoint, perhaps even angry.

The widescreen (2.35:1), non-anamorphic picture comes through well, as does the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio.  There is one interesting special feature included in a featurette titled `Altman on O.C. and Stiggs' (7:59) where the director offers explanations, but certainly no apologies.  Also included are previews for the films Christmas with the Kranks (2004), National Lampoon Presents Dorm Daze (2003), National Lampoon's Going the Distance (2004), and New Best Friend (2002).

2408440,1,B000B8IA1M,"Based mainly on a single National Lampoon issue, ""The Utterly Monstrous, Mind-Roasting Summer of O. C. and Stiggs"", the story of the problem teen O.C. Oglevey and his friend Stiggs, this film by none other than Robert Altman comes off looking more like a Cheech and Chong movie made by the Schwab family.

It's always a problem trying to bring a cult classic to the screen when everyone who was in love with the original had a picture in their head of what it should look like.  And even when the movie is pretty close to being accurate, like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", you can fail badly.  But in this case we did know what the story looked like, thanks to the profusely illustrated National Lampoon issue that actually showed O.C. and Stiggs and the various people and things that end up influencing their lives.

So, what was with the actors, who should have been switched if they were suppose to match their roles?  And what's with the Stude?  They drove an SS Chevelle, until it ended up burning in a ditch.  What's Sunny Ade got to do with anything?  OK, Altman must have wanted to help his career, very nice, but O.C. and Stiggs never mentioned him.  In short, what was the point of ripping up a brilliantly twisted story and re-writing it beyond the point of recognition?  Just to annoy the only people who would really care about this film in the first place?  Well, besides making a clunker of a film by any measure, he did.

The pity is that many folks only exposure to O.C. and Stiggs will be this awful film, and they'll never understand what made the magazine edition so great.  Go to the website and check it out, the entire story is still online.",1131667200,5,1669,4.468646864686469
2408441,4,B000B8IA1M,"One of the more underappreciated cult films of the past couple decades, ""O.C. & Stiggs"" is an adaptation of a series of National Lampoon stories centered around two high school kids and their attempts to make life hell for their insurance salesman neighbor, Randall Schwab.

I first saw this flick shortly after it was released in the mid-80s and I've probably watched it 100 times since. The lengths that Oliver Cromwell Ogilvie (""'O.C.' to my friends, of which I have one - Stiggs"") and Mark Stiggs go to make life miserable for Randall Schwab and his family make this film absolutely hilarious. From purchasing the loudest, most obnoxious car possible (""The Jilamonster"") to distributing Schwab Insurance t-shirts to the local derelict population to ultimately kidnapping Schwab with the help of psycho Viet Nam vet ""Sponson"" (played by Dennis Hopper!), the hijinx never seem to cease. And we are all the better for it.

And then there is the great King Sunny Ade. His music provides the great soundtrack and features such classics as ""Penkele"" and ""Moti Mo"".

Appearances by the aforementioned Hopper, Melvin Van Peeples, Tina Louise, Martin Mull, John Cryer and a cameo by Bob Ueker merely punctuate the excellence of this Robert Altman-directed, twisted comedy.

It took seemingly forever for O.C. and Stiggs to hit DVD and the wait was well worth it.

An ""utterly monstrous, mind-roasting"" film.",1131494400,10,1402,5.078260869565217

Kind of like Ferris Bueller's, but a thousand times more snarky. I have never read the National Lampoon stories, so have nothing to compare it to. But this film crawls along, peppered with ridiculous bits of dialogue that really make the film.",1340064000,2,517,5.0588235294117645

It is hilarious. It's completely insane and that's why I love it!
The entire movie is lunatic! From start to finish.
O.C. and Stiggs are two high school kids in the Phoenix, AZ area. they do some lunatic stuff with some lunatic characters through out this film. The two young guys playing O.C. and Stiggs aren't anyone you'll recognize but the rest of the cast is. For the most part.
Jane Curtain plays an alcoholic mother, John Cryer (""Two and A Half Men"") plays a young dorky teenager, Paul Dooley plays an insurance company owner named ""Schwab"" who O.C. and Stiggs are constantly trying to harass, Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) plays a yound teenaged girl, Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian) plays O.C.'s grandfather, a retired cop that only knows stories about his cop days, Tina Louise (Gilligan's Island's Ginger) plays O.C. and Stiggs buddy's mother, Louis Nye (Steve Allen's troupe) plays a gay teacher and Dennis Hopper plays a Vietnam vet who has gone over the edge. You'll also get to see and hear ""King Sunny Ade and His African Beats"" playing ""Juju"" music. It's outstanding!
It's great fun directed by Robert Altman (M.A.S.H.).

2408447,2,B000B8IA1M,"It's a little shocking to see that studios are still releasing non-anamorphic transfers of widescreen movies this late in the game. But I suppose with this movie, it was non-anamorphic or nothing at all, since this doesn't seem like a DVD that's likely to sell millions of copies. I assume that the transfer comes from an earlier laserdisc version or something.

At any rate, it's nice to be able to see Altman's full widescreen images, even in a poor transfer, but the truth is that this is probably his worst movie. He takes the unredeemable sociopathic dirtbags from the original National Lampoon stories and tries to transform them into the suburban 80s version of Hawkeye and Trapper John. The original O.C. & Stiggs didn't care whether Schwab had cancelled someone's insurance unfairly; they just hated him because he had a funny name.

The transformation of O.C. & Stiggs into ""heroes"" severely waters-down the original stories, whereas the weakness of the original material gives Altman virtually nothing to work with. We're left with a sorry mish-mash of aborted social commentary and truly awful attempts at ""zany"" humor (e.g. ""boing"" sound effects whenever someone gets stuck by a cactus, or the musical spoof of the ""Pink Panther Theme"" when the boys are sneaking into Schwab's back yard).

This gets one extra star because even the worst of Altman's work is worth a look to fans, but this is truly one of the most misbegotten movies that director ever made.",1186617600,3,1470,4.94331983805668

a bad video on a TV screen glimpsed through a dirty window. It

is not even ""barely watchable"" - it is utterly unwatchable.

This may not be one of Altman's best, but surely it deserves

better treatment than this, if only for those of us who want

to be able to view this auteur's complete body of work. Whoever

produced this DVD ought to be ashamed of themselves.

I have bought both the US and UK disks in the hope that one

of them might be better than the other. No such luck - they

are both the same crappy junk. Money down the drain.

2408451,4,B000B8IA1M,"O.C. and Stiggs is a pure gem. The other reviews give you background, but what needs to be emphasized is that this film is filled with Robert Altman's special layered dialogue.

It's a weird little thing, but a fun watch, if you're a child of the 80's. It's also not politically correct, but if you bear in mind that it was meant to be tongue-in-cheek, it's not as flinch-inducing- it was a commentary about the era, as much as anything else.
