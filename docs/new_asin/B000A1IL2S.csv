2349215,5,B000A1IL2S,Ordered two DVD's of the movie and received them in a timely manner....I have had no problems ordering things on Amazon....great opportunity is provided to us by this company on the net.,1168300800,3,186,4.84375
2349216,5,B000A1IL2S,"I first saw this movie way back when on Disney. I remember that they had played it a few times around Halloween, and that I really, really liked it. I also remember that the next year, they had come out with that crud-fest Halloweentown. Under Wraps was on after that one night, and I remember the pain of having to sit through that junk to get to the good stuff. After that night, I never heard from Under Wraps until now. I always wondered what had happenned to it, never seeing it on Amazon here or in the stores. And then one day I looked it up and there it was. So I ordered it. My brother vaguely remembers how awesome this movie was. How some friends who are almost completely different (The lead loves horror movies, his best friend is scared and nerdy, and the opinionated girl in the group has a crush on the lead...if I remember correctly. It's been nearly 7-8 years) come together to help out a mummy who pretty much lost his way. He gets woken up, and the slapstick ensues. During the movie, they all go through changes and face their fears to help out their new friend. Real life-lesson type of stuff. I'm really looking foreward to having my little sister view and enjoy this great flick for the first time, and as I said, my brother faintly remembers this movie. I loved it because it had so many cool, flushed out characters and it was actually funny and almost scary (for a kids movie) at the same time. I can't wait until my bro and sis sit down to watch this piece of cinematic gold because I know that when they laugh at some mummy standing still in a boy's bedroom while his mom is scoffing at him, I'm going to laugh that much harder.

If you're looking for just a fun watch, grab this. If you're looking for a fun watch with kids, grab this. If you're an overly cynical movie buff who has no time to waste on kids movies because they are boring and insipid (Like I used to be), then pull the stick out and grab this. Not only is it entertaining as hell, but it's got the guy from Coach. (I was never a big fan, but overly cynical people are. The more boring it is the better it is, right?)

Entertaining plot, great characterization, astounding acting by kids and adults alike, some really good laughs and some kid-friendly but effective scares (How about that scene in the beginning, with that movie monster and the garbage disposal! SWEET! And on Disney no less!)...five stars all around!",1132876800,25,2414,4.374164810690423
2349217,5,B000A1IL2S,"Why did Disney wait so long? Our son has loved this movie since it was first shown during Halloween,1997. Every few months or so, we would look on Amazon.com to see if it was available for sale. We taped it years ago but the quality of the tape is poor and it is worn out so I was so happy to finally see it available on DVD at Amazon.com and ordered it immediately. The acting by the kids isn't so great, but the story is fun and the theme music is memorable. Bill Fagerbake is great as the mummy.  Our son just loves the fact that he is in this film and is also ""Patrick"" from ""Sponge Bob Square Pants"" and one of the Criterion Brothers in one of our other favorite movies, ""Funny Farm"". This movie is heart warming and fun. It didn't win any awards, but it is an enjoyable Halloween film that can be watched anytime during the year. Thanks Disney and Amazon.com!",1128470400,9,865,4.210843373493976
2349218,5,B000A1IL2S,"I'm so glad this was finally released!! My Mom saw it a few years ago on the Disney Channel, but could never buy it on VHS because Disney hadn't released it.  I finally saw it while looking for other Disney Channel movies (Halloweentown), and I now have ""Under Wraps"" on order.  A great Halloween movie for young kids.  It has to do with a mummy (named Harold by his rescuer) that is looking for his lost love, and must do so by midnight on Halloween night.  Buy it!!

It was also filmed in my home town of Chico, CA so seeing the settings of this movie is so familiar to me.  I attended the School where the Halloween party was filmed at.  Chico High.  Great movie specially around halloween time.  The scene where the kids are riding the bike with the orange and black squares is the old Central Park downtown Chico, they have redone it since this movie and how us Chicoans miss the old way central park used to be.
