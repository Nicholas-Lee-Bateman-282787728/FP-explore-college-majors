7368308,4,B013P0X1HK,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Straight Outta Compton""

1. This movie is an interesting, intelligent - and kind of revisionist - history of the rise and fall of revolutionary hip-hop group N.W.A., and the way they punched America in the face.

2. The movie starts in 1986, when five young men in Compton, California, form a loose group to develop and play what they call ""reality rap"" to play in local clubs. When music manager Jerry Heller discovers them, he helps to make them famous.

3. The movie is really about the clash of two ruthless cultures: urban black street life and the music business. It does a great job of weaving American music history, contemporary culture, and interpersonal relationships together. It is not preachy, nor is it angry. It's a real, legit movie.

4. The five main actors are pretty unknown, but they do a great job handling such iconic characters. I was especially impressed by Jason Mitchell, who played Eazy-E. And to be honest, I wasn't expecting much out of O'Shea Jackson, Jr., but he surprised me by how well he played his own real-life father.

5. Considering how much of the group's history and lifestyle is common knowledge, it is fascinating (and disappointing) to see it being re-written right in front of our eyes. This movie is also an attempt to romanticize and make a new hero-myth out of a legitimately controversial group.

6. The group was well-known for their song ""F*** the Police"", which became kind of an anthem for disaffected urban youth. It serves a prominent role in the movie. But they were also just as well-known for their horrific attitudes towards women - they really helped solidify sexist rape culture in hip-hop. The movie does not play the song ""One Less B***h"", which is about gang-raping and killing women.

7. Dr. Dre, who co-produced the movie, is receiving a fair amount of criticism for using the movie to erase the history of his own troubles with women. Perhaps the most infamous incident - when he picked up journalist Dee Barnes by the hair and repeatedly bashed her face into a wall - was not even mentioned.

8. The concert scene in Detroit, when the group was arrested after playing ""F*** the Police"", is a nice piece of cinema, and portrays the group as unofficial heroes of free speech. It also never happened.

9. If you can separate the screenplay from the history, and focus on the movie itself, this is a great film. It's a unique American epic, and shows that some of the issues America faced in the late 1980's haven't progressed very far. There is enough historical authenticity to be educational as well as entertaining. Just keep in mind that in the end, this movie is focused on entertainment.",1439683200,117,2687,4.736616702355461
7368309,5,B013P0X1HK,"At this review, the movie is still enjoying an amazing first weekend in movie theaters. Though 2 1/2 hours, this is time well-spent in becoming familiar with the gangsta rap group, NWA, that formed in late 1980s Compton, California.

The writing, direction, cinematography, acting, and score are top-notch. Tasked with reinterpreting famous music figures of a particular time and place, each of the team members involved with bringing the story to visual life have succeeded beyond the highest expectations.

The writer provided a linear story that covered the three leads in three dimensions while including vital information from supporting figures, news footage, and the songs themselves. The director managed to provide coverage of multiple actors from multiple angles with overlapping dialogue that kept the story moving forward at an exciting pace. The cinematographer swooped camera angles in a breathtaking array of crowd scenes. The three lead actors, all relatively unknown, brought tons of charisma, charm, and passion as well as voice talent and stage presence.

Finally, the movie manages, as well, to include social, cultural, political, economic issues that informed the music of NWA and the lives of the group's members at that time--single parenthood, racism, police brutality, drug wars, AIDS, censorship, exploitation by music executives.

The theater in which this reviewer saw the movie was a full house at the first matinee showing. The audience applauded as the credits rolled and provided updates on two of the leads. Also, this bears saying, because of the ugly assumptions made by mainstream media, that expected, anticipated, and maybe even desired a show of mindless violence and savage rampaging through the theaters by moviegoers. The audience at this showing was mostly middle-class African Americans who grew up listening to NWA, and are part of the same age group and demographic as the group members themselves, parents and responsible members of the community. Everyone came in, sat down, ate popcorn, watched a great movie, applauded, got up, left, and went home. Just like normal people!

No one overturned cars or broke windows. Shame on you. Please be more responsible in your reporting. Perhaps take another look at Straight Outta Compton and then consider your own role in inflaming racial hatred against African Americans more carefully.

This movie is highly recommended.",1439683200,8,2414,5.389920424403183
7368310,5,B013P0X1HK,Great Movie Anybody know the release date  ?????,1439683200,27,48,5.0
7368311,5,B013P0X1HK,"Excellent movie and well crafted. It starts with a look at the early days of each member, how they struggled in their daily lives to make ends meet while yearning for something better. Racial profiling by the Compton police is a prevalent theme throughout and one of the driving forces behind the formation of NWA.

This movie is not just about black versus white or gangsta rap music; it is a story of human character and empowerment that everyone can relate to. Everyone has had their back up against a wall at some point, and this movie shows what can happen when you have the confidence, drive and integrity to fight it. Everyone can apply these lessons to their own life and prevail. It's a story of an American dream that started with five guys in a garage whose original goal was to give a voice to the people in their neighborhood but they ended up changing the world.

Although the film does a great job of depicting the group's memorable and newsworthy moments, it does stray from the original premise near the end. A lot of what happened as the group began to disband and with Suge Knight coming around could have been eliminated. After Dre left that was pretty much the end of the NWA story. Too much focus was on Suge Knight and Death Row Records in the later part of the movie. As much as I love Snoop and Pac, they didn't add anything to the story. I felt it would have been stronger if it was focused solely on NWA and its members and not so much the aftermath. There were too many additional characters and sub-plots near the end which muddied the original storyline.

One chronological issue was the scene with Tupac in the Death Row recording studio. Tupac wasn't signed to Death Row until October 1995 and Eazy-E passed away in March 1995 so there's no way that scene could have happened before Eazy's death. A few other inaccuracies such as Eazy-E approached Jerry Heller to sign a contract, not the other way around, and the group members getting arrested not during the Detroit concert but afterwards at the hotel. But hey, it's Hollywood and they make movies to entertain even if it means tweaking the facts a bit.

Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E, O'Shea Jackson, Jr as Ice Cube and Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre were particularly stunning in their performances, from their subtle mannerisms to their stage presence. Overall it was an inspiring and powerful story, and a reminder that anyone can achieve their dreams and get their voice heard.",1439683200,6,2456,4.600456621004566
7368312,5,B013P0X1HK,They did a GREAT job getting people close in resemblance. Even the voices of some characters sound like the original crew. I found it funny that a lot of people that attended the movie I was in didn't seem to know the actual music.

With the inclusion of the best tunes from N.W.A.'s career, the incidents inspiring them and repercussions following them, along with world-class acting, one will truly feel as if they're really along for the ride back in late 80's Compton.

7368316,1,B013P0X1HK,"STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON

I love a good musical, so when a friend said I simply had to see STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, I gathered up the wife and kids for a family night at the cinema.  Not five minutes into the movie, I realized I'd made a terrible mistake, for instead of a cheerful Harold Hill or dutiful Nellie Forbush belting out show tunes our harmonizing heroes here are angry, thuggish characters with names like Yella and Eazy-E, struggling ""musicians"" living in a world populated by pimps, prostitutes, and crack dealers, and believe me, these streetwise wordsmiths aren't singing about geese and ducks and riding through the country in a fringe-covered carriage!  Be warned -- this is no OKLAHOMA!  and THE MUSIC MAN has packed up his troubles and moved on to more tranquil surroundings.

Now, to be fair, my children DID enjoy the booming bass and throbbing beats that serve as the movie's songbook, and I'll even admit that numbers like ""She Swallowed It"" and ""I'd Rather F*** You"" are catchy, unforgettable, endlessly hummable compositions once you've been exposed, but  the breezy, light-hearted fun of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN or even STATE FAIR is wholly absent here.  As such, I'd suggest skipping the movie and picking up the soundtrack just so the kids have something new to listen to when school goes back.  As for me, I won't be planning a return to Compton any time soon",1439596800,43,1382,4.801687763713081
7368317,4,B013P0X1HK,"""Straight Outta Compton"" (2015 release; 147 min.) brings the story of the mega-influential hip-hop group N.W.A. As the movie opens, we hear radio and TV snippets over the opening credits about ""the war on drugs"" and the ""crack epidemic in America"". After the opening credits, we are reminded that this is ""Compton, CA, 1986"". During the initial 20 min. or so, we get to know how N.W.A's five members (Dr. Dre, Easy E, Ice Cube, DJ Yella, and MC Ren) all live in Compton and are dealing with various problems (the police being one, obviously), and how N.W.A eventually came into being. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: the movie is directed by F. Gary Gray, previously best known for directing ""The Negotiator"" and ""The Italian Job"". With all due respect for those earlier movies, what Gray has accomplished with ""Straight Outta Compton"" is in another league altogether. I should mention that I'm not particularly a fan of hip-hop music. That, and the movie's 2 1/2 hr. running time, almost kept me from going to see this. But given the almost universal critical claim this movie has been gathering, and the fact that I love music in general, including musical bio-pics and documentaries (such as the recent Brian Wilson ""Love and Mercy"" bio-pic and the Amy Winehouse doc called ""AMY""), I decided I needed to check out what the buzz was all about. So glad I did. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is almost epic, covering the years 1986 to 1995, and a lot of ground is covered indeed. All of the classic moments are here, including of course the immediate incident leading to the band making ""F Tha Police"", their seminal 1989 tour at the top of their game (and fame), and on and on. The biggest surprise of the movie for me is the fairly large amount of screen time for Suge Knight, whom we see entice, intimidate, cajole, threaten, bully and outright force himself onto the West Coast hip hop scene (and he is of course as we speak held on a murder charge). The acting performances are top-notch throughout, including O'Shea Jackson, Jr. as Ice Cube (Ice Cube's real-life son, incidentally), Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre and Jason Mitchell as Eazy E. Bottom line: these 2 1/2 hours just flew by.

The movie opened today, and the early evening screening where I saw this at was quite well attended. We here in Cincinnati got an extra jolt when at some point, when N.W.A was on the 1989 tour, we see a brief reenactment of their show at Riverfront Coliseum (nowadays known as US Bank Arena). When the end titles started rolling, there was a spontaneous applause from the audience, just to give you an idea how well the movie was received at this screening. Bottom line: if you love music (even without being a big hip-hop fan), you will not want to miss this, and I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Straight Outta Compton"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1439510400,65,3008,4.673584905660378

The other rappers struck me as thugs, and the lyrics were so offensive, I ignored the whole genre. Then I watched ""Defiant Ones"" and learned what a good person Dr. Dre is (not to mention a smart businessman), and that he's not the misogynist his lyrics might suggest. Now I watch ""Straight Outta Compton"" and my mind is blown. I am SOLD on these artists, sold on rap as an art form -- I can't wait to explore each of these artists and listen to their work. These men really are American heros, black heros, poets, artists and just plain ol' brave men. I didn't know what I a debt I owed them till I watched this movie.",1505088000,,756,4.220689655172414

I am certainly no fan of Rap music I am strictly a Rock and Roll guy. I knew about NWA only because they got into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame and I wasn't so sure about that either. That being said I thought this movie was excellent. A terrific account of some very talented guys in a very rough environment in a very trouble Country. I know a lot about the music business as I have been in it myself for many years and the corruption is rampant on every type and level of the game. I got a real awakening, and probably an eye opening exposure to a genre that I didn't give enough credence too. Great piece of work here, I was moved by the performances and I recommend this film to everyone.

7368564,5,B013P0X1HK,"Straight Outta Compton is the biopic for Rock & Roll Hall of Famers NWA who for better or worse depending on perspective helped bring rap music to the mainstream in the 1980s and early 1990s. As a matter of disclosure, rap music is not my favorite, I would rather get cavities filled then listen to it. That being said, I suggest that the rap averse population out there give Straight Outta Compton a chance because rap music is a significant element of American culture to many people.

I thought Straight Outta Compton did a really good job casting the story as one of American history in that the NWAs rap emerged out of a very real perception of police brutality against African-Americans in LA. Then the NWA get famous and presumably rich except for the questionable behavior of a business manager and record executives. Viewed through this lens, Straight Outta Compton is really a story of injustice, greed, rebellion, friendship. Strip away the rap music and baggy clothes and its really a bona fide American Dream.",1492387200,3,1022,4.806818181818182

Unlike today this genre of music does not emphasize on the struggles of the community and the change and equality it hopes will emerge from these messages. 'Straight Outta Compton' is a story told with great pace, fantastic acting and some true moments that will resonate emotionally. Any fan of this group of artist will love the moments when the songs are written and performed in concert. I was actually surprised that this film did not get more Oscar buzz.

7368986,1,B013P0X1HK,"Chuck Dee warned ""don't believe the hype..."" Yet many do. NWA was a ""studio gangsta"" crew. Ice Cube momma made his get his college degree before he could return to the studio. In China, we call them paper tiger! A dog with no teeth. This movie, as a stand alone movie, would have been aight, but as a ""piece of history"" it is packed with hyperbole, misrepresentation, bravado, and deception. No doubt they, with the direction of many not-so-NWA producers released some noteworthy tunes. For real. But as far as they ""thuggish lifestyle"" as portrayed here, no. NWA was an act, a work, like professional wrestling. And some made the mistake of thinking they were the real deal. Today, EZE dead, O'Shea is a cross-over movie star, and Dre hanging on with Eminem and them. I ain't buying it, not even with YOUR money!",1484092800,,813,4.652777777777778

7369132,4,B013P0X1HK,"It was an entertaining movie, would recommend it.

The group and their music were heavily whitewashed to appeal to your average American theatre goer. I was one of the white kids in suburbia that bought their tapes (and who most of their sales came form) because they swore so much and rapped about outrageous topics. NWA's musical subjects can be summed up pretty well by:

Glorification of:
1) misogyny in every imaginable form
2) murder
3) rape
4) beating women
5) selling and taking drugs
6) being drunk or high
7) several forms of armed robbery usually ending in homicide or torture

But oh they did it with flare. Listen to ""E-Z Does It,"" their best album in my humble opinion.

I think the whitewashing of their music and history is an interesting commentary by the movie (most likely unintended) on white liberal America somehow looking the other-way when it comes to black gangsta rappers and their lyrics...almost to say, well they just can't help themselves because they are poor and black so we can't hold them to the standards of whites and white recording artists. Which is kind of, actually, by definition racism.

The movie throws in the Rodney King beating and the Nation of Islam as if to tie, NWA in with civil rights and black empowerment? This is a complete joke, NWA had nothing to do with making their communities better or any sort of political movement. I'm guessing Dr. Dre and Ice Cube had something to do with this to try and make their time in NWA not look like what it really was. Hey, if I were them, I'd try and do the same thing. But casting N.W.A.'s message as anything remotely constructive is laughable at best.

Just one man's opinion. Good movie, but a highly sanitized and PC version of the real group and their music.",1481155200,,1757,4.615384615384615

The movie helped fill in the blanks for things that didn't make sense at the time.  It also showed a more human side of the famous Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre.  I was really impressed with O'Shea Jr. I imagine since he is the spitting image of his father,  it wouldn't be difficult to portray Cube.  But he had to be him in a younger age in a different time while showing the pressures he was able to overcome to make him who he is today.  THAT had to make it harder and I think O'Shea did it well.

7369289,3,B013P0X1HK,"Straight Outta Compton"" has the similar taste of the other Music business,Wall Street business and the merchandise business movies which could easily satisfy and inspire the
young audience to live their Katharsis of being a successful man or woman in the future, like the depicted successful people in these biographical genre movies. Because of theming this advantageous fact, usually these kinds of movies reaches the box office success in a short time (The Recent Example is The Wolf of Wall Street ). In addition to that, if you choose real biographic characters who live in ghettos and climbing the huge wall of the world's top in a while, definitely sell. Especially to young needy teenagers and young people eager to try everything to break the societies pressures and taboos.
The expectation on the box office is important of course. ""Straight Outta Compton"" will possibly gain the success on box office. But some effectiveness' can make the audience feel uncomfortable about watching it again or remember it as their one of all time favorite classic. At least I will criticize the defectiveness that I have determined after I watched the movie until the end.
The Subject of the biographic approach of Rap All-Stars is a perfect and unique idea. The originality can't be questioned. However the catharsis that I have mentioned before could not work for all cinema audience, I found the directing, acting and narration superficial. This was not the first biographical movie that has disappointed me with its narration and process of progression. And I think that won't be the last for sure. That's another argument. The main point is some biographies made by commercial concerns and cosmetic structure, harms them sometimes. This is the Rap Music's fathers' story,the action scenes could be more efficient on the contrary of matching some action b-movies, the classical and vigilant music agent profile played by Paul Giamatti, gave me the feeling of the same type which I ran across in other Music based movies. The actors who play the role of The Rap creators are good. The lack of the Katharsis begins with their shallow depiction, so that I definitely think that Dre or Ice Cube or Eazy E's lives depiction with other characters and crowded casting had created that mess and caused the defectiveness. Because almost 2 and a half hour movie isn't enough to depict the whole family of rap's beginning and the depiction of separate lives of them could make a better order in the narration. Linked to that criticism of the shallow narration, the documentary trace additions which would be a good idea on a biographical Movie, was used ineffectively in my opinion. For Example The Rap's born documentary series on VH1 would be watchable for all kinds of documentary lovers, so I believe that in the movie this magazine coverage documentary style is used by showing the social struggles of the Rapper's since their youth, the police's tough attitudes to the Black Citizens in their Neighbourhoods and putting the actual footage of the fights and plundering in the ghettos. However the idea of Half magazine and half crime narrated documentary style using in a movie, is very hard job and I realized that some parts were good adopted from this kind of E! or VH1 documentaries but some parts seemed weak because of several things that make the distinction between Documentary Movie and Cinema Movie, which would cause dead ends on the narration of Cinema Movie.
For instance the lack of voice narration as a result of the director's obligation of staying out of magazine words, the time-lapse difference between a documentary and a movie,the slow timing usage to tell the story in the movie on the contrary of a rushing biographical documentary and doing it with telling the audience the story of at least 5-6 rap stars in such a slow occasion, had killed the spirit of the ""Magazine-Documentary- Biography"" triplet style depiction. But I still believe that ""Straight Outta Compton"" could easily be the first and unique example of the future styles of direction and maybe could create a new unique genre as well.",1474243200,,4115,4.973875181422351

I was going to rent, but I saw it had a commentary (a big selling point for me!) but it turns out that's what I would've done after renting anyway. I knew about NWA, but not a lot. I grew up in the 90s, but not on East or West coast, so it was interesting to have more insight on that (and how Dr. Dre escaped that). Very relevant to what is happening today with police brutality and racial profiling as well. It reignited my 80s/90s rap fire as well, as I've been bopping to SOC and Boyz N the Hood recently! I agree that it skimmed over a lot of the story, but for the time a movie has to explain everything, it certainly does the job.",1468713600,2,687,3.9855072463768115
7369492,5,B013P0X1HK,"I was long past young when Easy E and NWA made their debut and though I bopped my head to the beat, I never bought the music.

It showed me the roots, why it came about and its importance in the theme of things. The script was excellent, acting superb and I truly enjoyed it.

It was entertaining, informative, enlightening and eye opening. I got to say that I clapped at the TV when 'Ice Cube' refused to sign the contract. My hope is anyone who wants to be an artist take note. You sign nothing until you have YOUR attorney check it over. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and my hat's off to everyone involved in bringing it to the big screen. Kudo's to writers, directors, cast and crew.

Well it was ok in my opinion. Nothing spectacular (I am not a rap fan). It really felt like a made for VH 1 movie to me. The actors were good but the story is a typical music biography film. The young kids become big stars, the internal squabbles over money, etc.

I watched the director cut version so maybe the theatrical release is shorter as it really dragged.

The film's only drawback is its tendency to make it rather obvious that is a ""Hollywood,"" rather than a ""Compton"" presentation. One example of this illustration is in the scenes that depict ""car show"" level street rods bouncing up and down on hydraulic lifters. Although the phenomena certainly occurs in this area, magazine cover ready rods are few and far between in these neighborhoods. However, if you want to feel some strong acting wrapped in a solid story line, and a powerful recent history lesson, I highly recommend viewing this film.",1466208000,,644,4.91743119266055
7369655,4,B013P0X1HK,Nice movie.  As a fan of stage lighting they got the lighting design right for the nightclub that DJ Yella started at.  I spotted several Clay Paky AstroDisco 3 lights and several unidentifiable helicopter type lights.  The lighting design for the roller skating rink was almost right till I spotted some LED based strobe lights with the AF1000s.  Also technically the AF1000 strobes did not exist till the 90s.  They might have had Lightwave Research DataFlashes which look similar so it was almost authentic.  Later on in the Detroit concert scene there were all LED lights in the lighting truss which was totally wrong.  They would have had halogen based par cans at that time.  So the authenticy of the period lighting design went down the toilet as the movie progressed.  That's my main complaint about this film.,1466208000,2,818,4.869565217391305

I do think more time could've been spent on East Coast artists Who influenced everyone, but then it would've been four or five hour movie.

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Straight Outta Compton chronicles the rise and fall of the seminal hip-hop group, N.W.A., who broke on the scene in the mid-80s. The entire point of hip-hop of course is for the rapper to deliver a stinging set of clever lyrics to effect a devastating comeuppance to his opponent. N.W.A. was one of the first hip-hop groups to employ ""gangsta rap,"" a heavily street-infused parlance marked by blunt verbal jabs, often employing phrases considered ""obscene"" in more ""polite,"" white society.

The purveyors of hip-hop (i.e. of the gangster variety), have often been criticized for encouraging violence as often the lyrics involve one threat or another to an intended rival (whether that be a specific individual or a more generic group). Defenders of the genre maintain that ""gangsta rap"" merely reflects the realities of the street and should be considered ""artistic expression"" protected by the First Amendment. The reality is that this type of music is nothing more than braggadocio and is very much akin to a violent video gameit is of course up to the ""player"" or ""listener"" to recognize that the fictional content of a gangsta rap song or violent video game is exactly that fictionand is not necessarily intended to encourage violence in real life.

The story of N.W.A., particularly in its first half, pulls you in just like any good police procedural. There are the three principals, Eazy, Dre and Cube, who come from completely different walks of life, and you want to know just how this diverse crew end up becoming successful in the music business. The first scene is startling as Easy escapes a police raid on a crack house. Dre is determined to follow his dreams despite the fact that his mother feels that he's not being practical by pursuing a career in music. And Cube, a high school student with a notebook of clever lyrics, almost becomes the victim of gang-banger violence, when a thug boards his school bus, pulls out a gun and threatens to shoot some of the students on board.

When a more ""professional"" group of rappers decline to become involved in the new start-up, Dre convinces Eazy to perform a potential hit song himself. The song, Boyz-n-the-Hood, becomes a big hit, which attracts the attention of Jerry Heller (played adroitly by the ubiquitous Paul Giamatti), who gets the group a contract with Priority Records.

Police harassment is a constant theme in Straight Outta Compton, and when group members are harassed by members of the LAPD outside their recording studio, this inspires Cube to write and record another big hit, ""Fk the Police."" While members of the band and Heller despise the negative and over aggressive stance the police take toward the black community, there is never a suggestion that there are any good apples at all in the police department. What's more, given the fact that police officers face ultimate annihilation by real criminals in places like Compton every day, it's understandable that many of them are on edge. The lack of professionalism and over aggressive stance is a just criticism by rappers like Ice Cube, but there are always two sides to a storyand the juvenile exhortation to ""Fk the Police,"" is certainly not always a helpful one.

Indeed, the reality of a bigger problem than police violence in the black community (i.e. black on black violence) becomes apparent in the tragic scene involving Dre's younger brother, murdered by other youths from his community back home. Indeed, for all the Rodney King-like incidents (overly highlighted in the film), they pale in comparison statistically to the murders that occur every day between members of the same race in the so-called ""ghettos"" of US cities.

As we reach the mid-point, there's more fascinating stuff especially with Cube's decision to quit the band after claiming Heller is intentionally withholding his contract. Cube subsequently becomes successful as a solo act and a ""rap war"" ensues between Cube and Eazy, with Eazy claiming Cube is a ""Benedict Arnold,"" and Cube responding with his infamous ""No Vaseline"" track.

Heller turns out to be the film's main antagonist, with Dre and Eazy also eventually turning against him. The accusations against Heller are perhaps the least convincing aspect of the film; there is a rather lame scene where Eazy's girlfriend is going over the ""books,"" and claims, without any in-depth explanation that Heller gypped all of the N.W.A artists. In the face of a recent lawsuit instituted by Heller against the film's producers, we'll see who's telling the truth when the lawsuit is over.

The second antagonist here is Suge Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, along with Dr. Dre. Knight is ably highlighted as a thug, when he beats up Eazy who refuses to release Dre from his contract. There's also another good scene where Knight mercilessly beats up a man over an innocent dispute over a parking spot. I suspect however, there much more to the Suge Knight story that the producers don't let on here.

Straight Outta Compton generally follows the basic history of N.W.A's rise and fall. But some things are left out to give the impression that the principals were not really such bad guys when they were indeed guilty of some rather noxious bad behavior. Dre's drunk driving is downplayed, a subsequent jailhouse stint is ignored along with a violent assault on a woman, resulting in a lawsuit and subsequent payment. To his credit, Dre has admitted that he did some things in his younger days he wasn't proud of, but it would have been nice to have seen some of those things in this film.

Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., steals the show playing his father in his younger days. The acting generally is quite good and the film covers most of the bases of the N.W.A history. Even if rap isn't your thing, this is a film worth seeing despite the limitations of hagiography.",1464998400,,5915,4.904

7369760,4,B013P0X1HK,"Being in the same age group as the original NWA members, I remember acutely their sound and popularity (and I was on the East coast) while growing up. I loved their style and talent. What I couldn't tolerate at the time was their glorification of gang/drug life and their degradation of women. I made the decision to purposely not purchase their music because of this and chose to support the more socially conscious rap groups of the day like Public Enemy, Brand Nubian, KRS One, etc.

Now older and a bit more seasoned (hopefully - lol), I see what NWA was doing: telling the story of their lives and those they personally knew. Not unlike the Andy Warhols of any era, NWA gave one an unsanitized version of what they grew up in and what they saw every day. To the surprise of many, not all Black Americans grow up seeing what NWA saw... I didn't and by no means was I a wealthy person, and because of this I didn't understand.

The one caveat I have with the film is that it sanitized both Dr. Dre's and NWA's relationships with women overall. Dr. Dre was a serial domestic abuser. Hopefully, that has changed, but I think the producers and writers of the film do NWA's legacy an injustice by not including that part of who some of them were. If NWA's goal was to show the world how it truly was then their abuse towards women should have been included in the film, too (mho). Still, biopics of many people play 'funny' with the details, so by no means are the producers and writers of the film alone.

Straight Outta Compton was nominated at this year's Oscars. Considering how huge the group was, how their influence and music expanded outside of the USA (which I did not realize until seeing the film), what they spawned in talent (Tupac, Eminem, 50 Cent, Snoop Dog, etc.) and how they came together in the first place, the nomination was well deserved.

Well worth watching both for cultural context and nostalgia.",1464134400,,1921,4.511494252873563

It depicts a band that had an EArth-shaking, life-change, society-changing effect in a tumultuous time around the Los Angeles Riots in 1992. Their honest and open discourse approach to lyrics was shocking and took a minute for society to swallow. But, the band had a positive overall effect on society from the West to the East coasts. I think everyone can benefit from watching this movie, not only for the knowledge dropped about what was happening in society at that time and what N.W.A. contributed to the overall discourse, but the viewer will have a damn good time as the movie is well made, the dialogue is on point and the music, of course, is flawless.",1464048000,2,716,4.690476190476191

There is nothing new I can say here that hasn't already been said about the significance of this group and the impact they had on not only music but in American culture. So there is no need to go into any of that. What I will say is that this is one of my favorite groups ever especially if anyone has read my music reviews before knows I love West Coast Hip Hop. So when this film came out you know I had to see it, especially since it also had stuff in it about my favorite record label ever, Death Row Records.

Of course you all know that the story follows the five members of the group NWA from their come up to the break up and to the careers after. The members of course being Eazy E, Dr Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren and DJ Yella with appearances from characters like the D.O.C., Warren G, Snoop Doggy Dog, Suge Knight, Tupac among others. From the humble beginnings playing at clubs to the recording of the classic Boyz in the Hood song it can all be found here. Of course there is the F the Police incident in Detroit and all of the inside beef that tore the group apart involving manager Jerry Heller.

It is that beef that is the most interesting I am sure to most people, from Cube to Dre and the formation of Death Row with Suge. Speaking of beef I liked that they included the record label office baseball bat thing with Cube that we all heard about on the Beef DVDs.  Also the infamous Eazy beat down at the hands of the Death Row camp is included and some stuff about Eazy starting to go broke, don't know how true any of this stuff is but I wasn't there so I cant speak on it.

This was an excellent film that was really well made, director F Gary Gray did an excellent job here as did the writers, even if the film made Dre and Cube look better than anyone else. The acting as well was amazing; from the main cast to the supporting everyone was great. I am surprised that Jason Mitchell did not receive an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Eazy. Everyone else was just as good from Cubes real life son playing his father and so on. The Blu-Ray comes with some good behind the scenes features but of course it is the commentary I enjoyed the most. I would highly recommend this film.",1463961600,,2214,4.163551401869159

Little did we know that those who survived the early years would remain icons for decades to come (and probably beyond).",1463788800,,520,4.48936170212766

Public Enemy and NWA dominated rap back in the day and people still talk about them to this very day. Some of the most banned, provocative lyrics in music history were made by NWA. This movie is the story of how they first became one of the greatest, most popular rap bands ever! The police hated them, the moral majority hated them, parents hated them; ya' know what?!

7369816,4,B013P0X1HK,"I've had an on/off relationship with hip-hop and rap music, and I'm certainly not well-versed in the history or behind-the-scenes goings-on with the artists themselves. However, I love a good musical biopic and STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is certainly that. For those few unaware, ""Straight Outta Compton"" was the debut album (and title track) from rap group NWA, with members Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (there might be more, but the film focused on those five). It tells the story of how the group came together, created some of their hit records, and broke up due to various reasons, mainly involving money and contracts. If that sounds like a lot to fit into a two and a half hour movie, you'd probably be right. It doesn't just stop with NWA's breakup, then following the solo careers of the three most important members. If there's a strike against the movie, it's that there was too much ground to cover and not enough time to do it satisfactorily. Still, the performances were excellent and I thought the actors did an incredible job of inhabiting their real-life counterparts. It should also go without saying that the film has stellar soundtrack. Narratively, the film seems to focus the most on Eazy-E, who the film is dedicated to, and most of the best moments involve him. There were many great moments, in fact, ranging from elation and awe, to a few that will probably have you tearing up. As for the film's Oscar snub, I can see why many felt it deserved a nod, but it honestly was a little too overreaching and bloated. Entertaining and fulfilling? Yes, but not necessarily Oscar-worthy. However, Jason Mitchell (Eazy-E) was most definitely snubbed. Overall, I feel like NWA's story would have been better served as a miniseries, considering how complex and large in scope the narrative is, but there is a 20-minute longer Director's Cut that I will be checking out in the near future. As for what I just watched, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a fascinating look at the rise of some music legends, an intimate look behind the curtain of the music business, and a loving tribute to a friend.",1462665600,4,2118,4.758152173913044

However, this is an AMAZINGLY done movie. The acting is simply astonishing. They did such a great job with this movie. Even if you were not an NWA fan...or a fan of rap - there is NO WAY that you wouldn't enjoy this movie. Be prepared for a lot of harsh language though...however, it is true to the time and feel of the movie and the situation.",1460937600,,505,4.00990099009901
7369943,5,B013P0X1HK,"Not a huge rapper fan but love Eminem. I was interested in SOC because of Eminem's connection to Dr. Dre. I found NWA's rise to fame intriguing. They literally clawed their way from poverty to fame. Riches too when they weren't being ripped off by record companies. I liked the performance of Ice Cube's son. He looks exactly like his Dad. Wonder if Suge Knight is still in jail? He's a backstabbing, violent bully.",1460851200,,415,4.621621621621622

7369945,3,B013P0X1HK,"S.O.C was one of the formative albums of my high school years.  My friends and I knew all the lyrics and would rap along with Eazy-E and Ice Cube and laugh and have a lot of fun.  When the movie came out, I was interested to know the story behind the rappers whose lyrics and beats I had come to know so well through listening to the album.

The story itself is original.  During the first part of the movie, I was engrossed in parts and definitely wanted to know what happened next.

The acting was decent for newcomers, but at times became wooden and showed a lack of real acting ability.  At the beginning of the movie, I didn't notice as much since I was distracted by the story, but by the end, the writing really starts to fray and the scenes become very melodramatic.  Combined with the somewhat amateurish acting, some scenes become almost unbearable to watch, like when Eazy is in the hospital.

A lot of scenes and characters in this movie get exaggerated, which I'm sure Ice Cube thought would make the topics more effective, but instead (at least for me) make them seem artificial.  If the movie had toned down the melodramatic aspects, I think it would have been a much more subtle and powerful piece and message.

I remember back when I was a teen, and looking at the Oscar nominees.  I liked movies like Rambo and Animal House.  I wondered why a movie like The Last Emperor was nominated and all the movies I enjoyed as a teen didn't even make the list.  Now that I'm older I understand.  The Oscars are meant to award outstanding accomplishments in film as far as acting, writing, directing, etc. which were not present in this movie at all.  Perhaps the movie spoke to people on an emotional level, but if looked at objectively is not an Oscar worthy movie.

All-in-all, the movie is decent.  The story was interesting, but the acting and writing really show signs of weakness, especially toward the end of the movie.  It's worth watching.",1460851200,3,1956,4.5085227272727275

I'm a REGULAR there, so the lady told me to drive around to see if I could find a space where I could see the screen. I did. It just wasn't the ideal space but I could see the screen. The movie was AWESOME!!! I'm always interested in SEEING & HEARING DIRECTLY FROM THE SOURCE about THEIR EXPERIENCE on this JOURNEY we call LIFE. Personally & Professionally.

Using drug money from Easy E.'s drug business to press the vinyl, Jerry Heller got a whiff and brought the men together to tour and make more records.  Little to be know, Jerry had other plans.  Using his friendship with Easy, the E. got paid while the others didn't, thanks to the contract that Jerry gave Easy.  From there, the group continued, while falling apart, slowly but surely.  At the end, N.W.A. was no more.  At the time of their reunion, came the ultimate blow that they would never recover from, even after all these years.  Hopeful, proud, distrusting, compromising, all of these feeling came up and those elements would make for an outstanding movie!!!!",1458345600,,820,4.725352112676056

Much of the film takes place in the Mid 80s to early 90s and touches on many issues that many feel are still happening today. Being a Los Angeles, CA native for 20 years seeing the locations of where they were i could recognize some but not all places. I never grew up in Compton but heard of its ""Urban Jungles"" and its troubled areas. Straight Outta Compton is a amazing true story of how a small group of aspiring teenagers living in poor conditions could reach new heights with passion for music and more importantly Hip-Hop. Experience a time when Rap/Hip-Hop meant more than just an easy cash grab or to be mixed into stupid pop artist songs for the use of hitting a wide age demographic.",1456876800,,823,4.248407643312102

8728265,5,B013P0X1HK,"LOVE this movie!  If you grew up in the 80's when NWA was at their prime then this movie is for you.  It's filled with great music of course, but more than that it makes you want to stand up for what you believe in and if you have a dream follow it. NWA set the stage for so many others who came behind them from a wide range of genres to have the freedom to do what they do. It still saddens me about Easy but much respect for coming forward about AIDS especially during that time when the fear and stigma was at it's peak.
