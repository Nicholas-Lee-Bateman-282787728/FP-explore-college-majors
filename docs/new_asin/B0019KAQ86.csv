8274227,5,B0019KAQ86,Are you a history buff? Have a taste for getting scared and for the creepy unknown? Then this is the documentary for you! I first saw this show on A&E and loved it. I bought this (More Haunted Houses) with the first in the series I also saw on A&E (Haunted Houses) and showed them both at a Halloween Party. They both gave my guests quite the thrill plus a little more wisdom about the historical events that surround the ghost stories on the side. A&E needs to make more like this series!,1371945600,2,489,4.268817204301075

8274229,3,B0019KAQ86,"Some chapters are repeats of many other DVD's, but at least they ared the more interesting ones!  The not so old stories are also quite informative and interesting.  I think overall it is a good buy for the price.",1356739200,,213,4.435897435897436
8274230,2,B0019KAQ86,So much more could have been done with this topic.  Was not impressed with the  production or the quality of the re-enactments.,1315440000,,127,4.7272727272727275
8274231,4,B0019KAQ86,"I rate this Documentary Good some Chilling Scenes,Kicked In The Gut,Hanged,Devil Baby,and the Winchester House really interesting.
Mediums talk and others do to about what they've seen and felt.
Five story's first one pretty good.",1282435200,,230,5.6
8274232,3,B0019KAQ86,This is a documentary that was definitely made on the cheap. But it still delivers some interesting history about some infamous haunted houses and the people who used to dwell in them...and who perhaps are still there in some fashion.,1279411200,,234,4.875
