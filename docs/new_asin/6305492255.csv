1035781,5,6305492255,"this was a pretty darn great show. my favourite episode is ""elsewhen"", in that episode is where holly meets her future self.  although the second & third seasons weren't as good as the first season  i thought it was a pretty terrific show.",968457600,4,239,4.534883720930233
1035782,5,6305492255,"I remember being completely obsessed with LOTL when I was a kid. This show had everything a boy could ask for in a TV show in the early to mid 70's:  dinosaurs, adventure, scary monsters, and an underlying creepiness that  tingled the spine. LOTL is indisputably a classic to those of us who were  growing up 25 or so years ago. In a group of your friends, sing  ""Marshall Will and Holly."" Chances are you'll hear a resounding  chorus of ""On a routine expedition"" in response.
The five stars  is for the quality of the show, particularly the enclosed episodes. The  extras are interesting, but too brief. The interview with the Krofts peaked  my interest in many ways, but I feel that a lot of intersting stuff was  edited out, particularly relating to their early years (there's a bit about  how holyman Billy Graham condemned them at the Seattle World's Fair in the  early sixties because of sexy topless puppets featured in a show of theirs,  which of course helped them to be the hottest show there, for example). The  bit with the actors who played Chaka and Holly was interesting and all, but  I wish they could have got more players involved to show up.
Also, while  the four episodes are excellent, I wish they would instead release the  entire series chronologically as a box set. Honestly, this teaser just  whets your appetite for more.",966384000,14,1347,4.639830508474576
1035783,5,6305492255,"I hadn't seen this show since I was about 5 or 6 years old, so when I saw this DVD at the store, I grabbed it immediately.  I don't know how kids today will react to it, given all the high-tech special f/x that are taken  for granted.  The fact is, this show really had a lot of good ideas behind  it and it stands up well.  From an adult perspective, it's fun to look at  how horrible the f/x look, and wonder how I ever was convinced it was  real.
Some of the stuff in these four episodes is pretty far out.  Consider the part when ape-boy Chaka comes over for dinner, and little  Holly gets all dolled up with make-up and perfume.  As Chaka becomes  apparently very attracted to the young girl, her brother and father chuckle  about how she's ""becoming a woman.""  Then later, Chaka and his  ape-parents kidnap Holly and take her back to their home where they can't  stop oogling her and sniffing her body (supposedly its because of the  perfume).  Pretty weird...
The DVD is a good value for the price.  There  are four episodes which run approximately 22 minutes each.  For bonus  features there is a very interesting 16-minute interview with Sid and Marty  Krofft and even more entertaining a 14-minute new interview with the actor  that played Chaka and the actress that played Holly.  The adult Chaka is a  relatively composed and dignified man.  The woman that played Holly,  however, laughs hysterically throughout the interview.  She seems kind of  demented.  And boy oh boy-- I had a crush on Holly as a kid, but I would  have never thought she would look like this today-- Yikes!",964310400,26,1591,4.496478873239437

Now, I need my DVD. There is something magical about LOTL. I  know  all the episodes are full of corny lines, campy acting, and really  fake looking effects, but we as Krofft fans keep coming back for more. Just  as we  did when we were kids back in the 70's, I find my self in front of  the tv with my sugar coated cereal, watching one of the best Saturday  morning shows to have ever graced the tube. I haven't even gotten it yet,  and im waiting on the next volume. So, take a trip back in time, and get  this DVD. You won't regret it....",963273600,12,702,4.0583941605839415
1035785,4,6305492255,"For at least a year, _Land of the Lost_ was  a huge hit for the under-10 set.  Like today's _Pokemon_, it featured an infectious cast and a satisfactory melding of familiar and alien characters.  Paramount among  these were the Sleestack, bipedal dinosaurs on a slithering mission of  human extinction.  They terrified children in the seventies with their  (mostly) non-verbal hissing and control of mystical jewel-operated power  pyramids.  Sounds ridiculous?  It quite happily was.
But the stories  worked even with bad special effects because of the earnest acting.  You  believed this single-parent family was in danger from the first episode,  and you also believed they WERE a family.  Over time, Marhsall, Will and  Holly actually became characters you cared about, and that emotional  involvement made you worry that the obviously fake T-Rex was gonna eat  them.
Are these the best episodes from the series?  It's hard to say,  because it's been so long absent from Saturday morning television.  But I  personally remembered the plot of ""The Stranger"" even after  decades.  It's memorable for the appearance of a talking, beneficent  Sleestack and (for kids) a surprising plot twist leading to an unexpected  moral.  ""The Search"" is not so tightly written, but it does  feature Cha-Ka, played by a young man who would eventually grow up to be  the musician Sugar Ray.
Viewed now decades away from the hysteria, it's  probably hard for most adults to see what all the fuss was about, but my  guess is that kids under 10 will still see Sleestacks under their beds at  night.  In any case, the low price makes it painless to take a trip down  memory lane.",959904000,3,1660,4.95970695970696
1035786,5,6305492255,"What can I say? Land Of The Lost was and still is one of my favorite 70's Saturday morning shows. Watching these video tapes took me back and sat me right in front of my old tv set, eating my sugar coated cereal, wearing my  pajamas, and not having a care in the world. These are great tapes of a  classic show. Buy them, you will love em....",953078400,5,342,4.014705882352941
1035787,4,6305492255,"The original Land Of The Lost remains a stellar series.  Verisimilitude permeates the show, from the very effective use of video matting to the elaborate miniature sets and often excellent animation (by Gene Warren Sr.  and Jr. and Peter Kleinow) of the show's dinosaurs, to the consistently  excellent performances of Spencer Milligan (as Rick Marshall), Wesley Eure  (Will Marshall), Kathleen Coleman (Holly Marshall), and Walker Edmiston  (Enik).
Bringing out the full power of the show were superior scripts  by sci-fi veterans David Gerrold, Ben Bova, D.C. Fontana, and Star  Trek/Babylon 5's Walter Koenig, and the flawless direction of Bob Lally and  Dennis Steinmetz.
Koenig and Lally wring maximum emotion out of the  cast in the episode ""The Stranger.""  I'd like to know if Lally  fed his cast gunpowder before shooting, for they fight and argue with an  unnerving amount of gusto.  Over-the-top then comes into play in the  climatic scene where Enik probes the Marshall family's minds and extracts  their greatest fears, leaving them as almost helpless wrecks.
From  Hitchcockian flavored psycological terror, Volume One then steps into  glorious Ray Harryhausen-flavored chase drama in ""Tag Team,"" in  which the Marshalls meet the show's resident prehistoric missing links, the  Pakuni (Philip Paley plays the youngest, Cha-Ka), and all are chased to a  huge crevase by the tyrannosaur Grumpy.  Will, Holly, and Cha-Ka are  trapped on a ledge twenty feet down as Grumpy gets into a yelling match  with another tyrannosaur, Big Alice - the video matte scene of the two  dinosaurs over the three humans is one of the best SFX shots ever.
Volume  Two opens with Ben Bova's ""The Search,"" in which Rick is  electrocuted by energy crystals.  Holly laborously brings her dad back to  their cave while Will tries to convince Enik to help them.  But Enik has  opened a dimensional dorrway to Earth, and urges Will to go through, to his  home.  But Will can't leave his family behind - can't he?
""Paku Who  Came To Dinner"" is another chase episode that piles on excellent SFX  footage in its story of Holly's kidnapping by the Pakuni, who are enamored  of the young lady's perfume.
The two tapes capture a memorable sci-fi  series.",938131200,23,2233,5.038461538461538
1035879,4,6305492255,"I had forgotten just how good they where.  Mind you you do have to put it all in context.  This is a Saturday morning show by the same people that brought you Sigmund and the Sea Monsters and the immortal H.R. Puffnstuff.  The only acting to be found, when it's found is over-acting.  The dialog is at times head-slappingly bad, and the constant bickering between Will and Holly gets so annoying, you have to wonder why Marshal doesn't throw himself down the Sleestack pit. The special effects range from the ""actually pretty darn good for the budget"" sort, to the downright laughable.  But then again that's part of the charm.
The dinosaurs are fairly well done for the time, especially Dopey--I mean you gotta love Dopey.  The Sleestack are still one of the best bad guys ever invented, and the overall concept is actually quite well written.
That's really where the strength of the series is--in the big picture moments and details regarding the pillons, crystals, and the inner workings of the world.
Having still been in diapers for at least part of the series' original run, I didn't have any clue who some of the people working on the show where, Gerald, Niven, Koenig. I was still young enough to be scared by Big Alice and Grumpy, how could I know who David Gerald was?  But thirty years later when I rented the first disc of season one, just for the nostalgia factor, I rediscovered that the series was actually good enough to re-watch the entire thing. Yes I spent plenty of time laughing and shaking my head at the bad bits, but I was pleasantly surprised just how good the good bits actually where.",1230422400,,1611,4.611888111888112

1035881,4,6305492255,"this is a fantasy story about how this family, the Marshalls, went river rafting in California, and encountered a freak occurence. They got sucked into a hole in space and time and went into another world. I like to think of it as an underground land, in peru or ecuador in south america. But its like a lost world kind of secret land. They arrive there and have to survive amidst dinosaurs and weird creatures , and theres caves and rivers and they have to get food to survive. Its quite realistic at times because they really try to get food, and find ways to get carrots and fruits from trees, and they find shelter in a rock cave high up that they call high bluff. The father thinks they should keep trying to get home and they found some kind of portal doorway to get back. He wants to get home and they keep trying to get through. I want to go TO the land of the lost, it's a really interesting place, (although the stuff seems a little fake at times, almost like its indoors?) ( I know, I know...)
I will eat carrots for a while, sure, to be able to explore all those weird caves and stuff. I'm just not sure where in peru or ecuador to start looking, it's not on any maps. Get a dv_ disc of the land of the lost , it's good media for kids to be exposed to.",1227571200,,1264,4.100806451612903
1035882,5,6305492255,"I grew up watching Sid & Marty Krofft shows!  I remember this one the most!  Every Saturdat morning I would wait for it to come on and you couldn't pry me away from the Television!  (I did cover my eyes immediately when the sleestacks came on, for some reason I was deathly afraid of them back then...I also referred to them as the ""sweestacks"" and my parents still laugh at me to this day!)

Anyway, I wanted to share my Saturday morning experience with my son because we were recently discussing what was on when I was young.  At first I was unsure on which disc to buy.  I know that the entire first season is out, but this disc has two great interviews with both Holly and Cha-ka that I think made this disc worth the money.  (Along with the episodes that are included on the disc of course!) I loved my Saturday's with the Marshall family : )

It's been fun revisiting my childhood and the Land of the Lost.  I have great memories and now they are just a dvd away!  It's great to see these older shows coming to dvd and I highly recommend them to anyone that was young or old growing up in the 1970's!",1203206400,8,1106,4.199052132701421

I was always fascinated by the idea that an earthquake could open a passage back in time to the dinosaur age...how does that happen? I ordered these tapes on a whim, and have enjoyed many a laugh since. The overacting and jerky special effects (which were cutting-edge thirty years ago) only add to the charm. My two-and-a-half year old daughter loves the episodes, and has added the words ""Chaka"" and ""Holly"" to her vocabulary. She is learning the words to the theme song, complete with the ""AHHHHHHHHHH"" when the raft plunges down the Tidy-Bowl waterfall. There are bigger collections now on DVD than when I purchased these tapes, but episodes of LOL in some format are a must-have for the retro collection of any child of the seventies!",1148688000,,826,4.783216783216783

As for the three aforementioned Sid & Marty Krofft shows ,these are great for reliving your childhood once in a while. Unless you have small children stick with these small packages instead of the entire series sets. Believe me you won't watch them enough. As for the reviewer wondering why someone remembered watching land of the lost in the same group as transformers. They weren't remembering the original series. There was a short lived remake of the show about fifteen or so years after this one.",1078099200,2,732,4.864
1035887,5,6305492255,"Im a little confused by the reviewer who claims to have watched the show along with G.I. Joe, Transformers ect., since Land of the Lost was a show that aired during the seventies,and the aforementioned shows were mainly eighties fare! must be another crude and crass attempt to exploit all things ""retro"". For those of you who actually watched the show in the seventies, this dvd is recommended and I do not know of a series compliation that is available or forthcoming at this time. I disagree with those who claim the show was a shoddy production at best. The show had some great storylines with some classic sci-fi/fantasy elements written into the script,- dimensional doorways, parallell worlds, aliens, lost worlds, and of course ravenous prehistoric beasts! The stories are not overburdened with trite ""moral"" commentary like so many youth shows of the seventies and even today contain.(Remember after school specials?, yeccch!)The acting is not corny and the actors give a perfectly suitable performance that is very much enjoyable. The special effects are easy to criticize in comparison to todays standards, but given the era, budget and other factors the shows creators had to deal with at the time, I think it can be excused, besides as a kid your imagination easily filled in the gaps back then. I must admit, Before I got the dvd, I was expected to be dissapointed after all these years, but to my surprise I throughly enjoyed every episode,including the vhs releases, but be aware if you purchase the dvd you will only need vhs volumes 3 and 4, my only complaint is that there are not more available.",1077408000,8,1615,4.876363636363636

Although it did bring back memories, I felt that I would have rather just rented it, as after watching the typical poor effects, and all my reminiscencing, my daughter or me wasn't interested anymore in watching the ... stop motion of the dinosaurs or of the poor costumes and sets. The only plus to the DVD was that I was able to see a few of the stars and what they look like now. There are multiple episodes on this DVD, but watching 1 is usually enough for the average person to say,  ""oh yeah, I remember this show, What else is on TV?"". They also have some commentary. I guess we sort of got spoiled with these new age special affects.

A special treat was finding out one of the episodes (The Stranger) is penned by Star Trek alum Walter Koenig.
The transfer to DVD is passable, but there are some areas where the series definately shows its age and could use some restoration.
The interview with Sid and Marty Krofft is very relaxed and low key and extremely interresting, too short for all these guys have done together.
The Holly - Cha Ka interview is definately for the adult crowd.  A good retrospective of the series, and ""Holly"" is definately not the innocent young blonde girl anymore!

I bought these remembering that one of the fascinating things about this show was that episodes were written by well known and successful sci-fi authors...Ben Bova, DC Fontana, Larry Niven, Theodore Sturgeon, etc. Yet the dialogue and story lines are still very simplistic and one note concepts...again for kids.
And while it's classic over-acting here (wayyyy over the top), it's the same hammyness that lends charm to the old Star Trek (a la Shatner). Overacting? Yes. But it still evokes more involvement and is preferrable to the dry talking heads of current s.f. shows (like any of the new Star Trek incarnations for example).
Of course, there's the additional charm of being from the mid 70's, the clothes, the hair. (Gotta love Rick Marshall's perm).
One major flaw seems to be the randomness of the episode selection for these two tapes as well as the other two tapes in the series (3 & 4).  Issuing them in chronological order would have been a lot more satisfying and as it is, the episodes jump around in time.  And running story elements such the mysterious unseen thing in the pit, the colored crystals that can combine for different effects, etc. pop up here without understanding their origin or context.
Was VERY disappointed that none of the 8 episodes released by Rhino here had those funky Pylons or Skylons with their resulting weather changes.
So if you're prepared for simplistic child like stories and dialogue, and stop-animation special effects that are straight out of the 1926 film The Lost World, combined with the puppetry of Sid & Marty Kroft you'll be very satisfied with these.",1017878400,6,1766,4.844370860927152

TOS. (LAND OF THE LOST: THE ORIGINAL SERIES), as opposed to LOL: TNG. (LAND OF THE LOST: THE NEXT GENERATION), which was a bastardization of the original.
LAND OF THE LOST is about the Marshall family. Rick, the
father, and his two children, Will, and Holly. They're your typical California family of the 1970s. Well, atypical's more
like it. In the first episode, THE STRANGER, they've survived an earthquake which hurled them over a waterfall and into a
mysterious land from which nobody escapes. The original
series is my favorite. Rick and his family rafted into the Land
of the Lost. They didn't drive in like the Porter family did in the 1989 revival of the '70s series. Rick Marshall was probably a forest ranger. He had two children. Will, played by
an actor who went by the one-word name of Wesley, who was probably around fifteen or sixteen when the show began, and his preteen daughter, Holly, played by Kathy Coleman. The show, especially its depiction of the dinosaurs, is rather dated. In 1974, there were two Apatosauruses, (that's what they're called now. Back then, it
was Brontosaurus), named Dopey, (the baby), and Emily,
his adopted mother. There were also Grumpy, a T-Rex with a bad attitude, and Big Alice, an Allosaurus with an equally
bad temper. The puppets were good. This was before computer animation and movies like Jurassic Park. It's also
before syndicated series like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. The best episode is the one written by Walter Koenig, Chekov, of Star Trek fame. It stands the test of time
and has been on NBC, CBS, and the Sci-Fi Channel.",1015459200,2,1645,4.836879432624113

I would not have kicked out $40 for 8 episodes had the above reviews not been so good.
What amazed me as I watched the shows--and I had not seen them since I was 10 years old in 1974--was the quality of the writing.  I would later go on to love science fiction and STAR TREK, but when I was 10 I had never heard of David Gerrold, D.C. Fontana, Walter Koenig, Ben Bova, just to name a few.  This Saturday morning kid's show had some of the best SF writers of its day...a truly amazing roster of talent.
It was worth the money to take me back in time, back to the house I grew up in.  As I watched, I remembered many scenes and nearly every plot, even though I thought I had forgotten them.  This is wonderful stuff.  The Sleestaks are still scary, the dinosaurs are still cool, and the acting, if a bit overdone at times, is pretty good.
I don't regret buying these episodes at all.  Even though I just got a DVD player, I bought the VHS tapes (both twin packs), because you get more episodes for less money than you do on the single DVD.  The only thing wrong with these sets is that there aren't enough episodes.  Hopefully one day they will release all 40+ episodes on a DVD set.  Until then, you can savor these.
Volumes 3 and 4 are probably the ones to get if you are on a limited budget.  The four episodes on these volumes were voted as the best by fans.

The case these DVDs come in is cheaply made and was broken in several places when it arrived. The DVDs look ok, but the case arrived unable to hold 4 of the 6 DVDs. So now I am looking through the house for old CD cases. Again, show rocks. DVD cases bites.",1526256000,,351,3.9577464788732395

7890037,4,6305492255,"This is a decent release overall, DVDs are the same as those available here in America unfortunately. I was hoping for higher quality, a more restored edition.
Good value, very reasonable price.
Discs come in a cheap and brittle case, it breaks easily.
Two of my discs are lightly scuffed and none have any fingerprints.

These are NTSC video format, Region 0 (ALL).
