8094094,5,B000BYA4KG,I've never laughed so hard.  The outtakes are even funnier.  I've become a devoted fan of Martin Clunes after watching Doc Martin on Public Television.  He is such a funny actor and comes across as very devoted to his family in interviews.,1399593600,,239,4.642857142857143
8094095,5,B000BYA4KG,I am a big fan on Martin Clunes and wanted to see the series that brought him fame. As a woman it took me a while to get used to the episodes. I really love them now and get a big kick out of the dancing at the end of each episode. Mr. Clunes said this is his favorite.,1333152000,,269,3.5762711864406778
8094096,5,B000BYA4KG,"This is where men Behaving Badly hit it's stride in the fourth series. This series features a few episodes that really stand out for me. The episode Drunk has Gary and Tony getting very drunk and trying to get back into their house when Dorothy has locked them out. In another episode Gary looks after Dorothy when she's had an operation. I always wince in that episode and I can safely say that should I fall ill I don't want Gary within 100 feet of me! In the final episode of the series I always crack up when I see Tony trying to remove his tooth, personally I think this is one of the funniest parts of the whole series. Of course Tony still has problems and this will change how everyone sees each other.",1143763200,4,710,4.266666666666667
