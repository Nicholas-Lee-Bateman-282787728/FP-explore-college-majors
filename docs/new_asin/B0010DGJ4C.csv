8237676,5,B0010DGJ4C,"My toddler absolutely loves all of the Brainy Baby IQ DVD series.  Although there are not any words being spoken, the classical music and high quality images are great.  The Baby IQ series encourages my toddler son to talk more.  He says a lot of words when he's watching like colors, numbers, shapes, or just plain words.  I also talk about on screen images when watching the DVD too.  The DVDs encourages curiosity from my son and he's constantly asking ""What is that?"" while watching.  Often times he's giggling and pointing to the TV while entranced with this DVD.  This is such a great educational buy and I wish that I'd found it during his infancy.  Excellent buy and I highly recommend this to those who have babies and toddlers!",1358121600,,737,4.615384615384615
8237677,1,B0010DGJ4C,"Both the Briany Baby IQ DVD's are not good. My baby loves Right Brain and Left Brain, so I ordered both of the IQ DVD's, hoping those would be a hit too.  She won't even sit through 5 minutes of them.  Not what I expected, I expected better.  I wouldn't suggest buying.  Even my older step daughters think they are freaky and will give her nightmares with the little puppets they use.  It is really odd.",1350000000,,403,4.25
8237678,1,B0010DGJ4C,Probably my fault but I didn't realize that this video was just music!  Not good for my one year old!  I wish I would have returned it!  :(,1329868800,,139,3.892857142857143
8237679,5,B0010DGJ4C,"My 3 month old was introduced to this video for the first time earlier this week and it was an instant hit.  I recently returned to work and my MIL who keeps my baby suggested we give him something to look at during the day  when he started to get fussy and couldn't be talked/bounced/walked out of it.  We didn't want to just turn on the regular TV, plus it's kinda high-up and we're not sure how far across the room he can clearly see at this age.  I'd picked this DVD up while I was pregnant and totally forgot about it.  Just so happened I stumbled across it the day after she suggested giving him some visual stimulation.  We popped it in the laptop and my little one was instantly captivated by the music, vivid and colorful child-friendly images, and the action/animation.  When he's fussy he's not always easily distracted/soothed so for this DVD to capture and quiet him so instantaneously was amazing.  Honestly we enjoyed looking at it as much as he did. The background music is a great compliment to the Little Einstein CDs that he already has.  So with the repetition between the two I'm sure he will come to recognize these classical melodies at an early age.

I just invested in Baby IQ Colors, Numbers, Animals, and the World Around Us as I'm convinced they will be a key part of his early education. And I love how it encourages conversation. Highly recommend.",1327017600,2,1377,4.516129032258065
8237680,5,B0010DGJ4C,"My 4 and 1/2 month old daughter, has become completely captivated by these DVDs. She has been listening to classical music for some time now. We even purchased the belly audio system, when she was in the womb. Over the past weeks, she does not wake up crying. It took about 2 or 3 weeks of rotation, now she is hooked, while rocking in her Zen swing or jumperoo. We rotate between calling out the colors, but it seems she much calmer now and is just taking it all in.",1311724800,,467,4.2
8237681,4,B0010DGJ4C,"I have a total of 4 of this brand of educational videos. The dvd keeps my son's attention, and introduces learning concepts of shapes, colors, animals, numbers etc. They also provide a guilt free way to give parents a break to eat etc.",1308268800,,235,4.488372093023256
