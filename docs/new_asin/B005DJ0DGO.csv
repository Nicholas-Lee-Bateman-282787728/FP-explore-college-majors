The director of RoboGeisha was also behind MACHINE GIRL and carries on the tradition of showing wild, never-seen-before gags with this movie. You get bizarre stuff like breast milk that melts faces, a robot castle, chest guns, knee guns, shoulder guns, and AssSwords (exactly what you think it is). VAMPIRE GIRL is equally as wild, improbably and totally inappropriate. I'm not really sure what to call this genre of movie. I suppose its horror-comedy, but its too bizarre for that. In any case, if you like this sort of movies, these two films are at the top of the class. This DVD set features both movies on a single dual-layer DVD (holds as much as two standard DVDs). Picture quality was very good. Can't really beat the price. I'm very satisfied and will be watching both of these again.",1312848000,2,937,4.616766467065868
