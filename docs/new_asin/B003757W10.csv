8390291,5,B003757W10,"Acis and Galatea is an oratorio but it is presented in this production as a combination of an opera and a ballet and the result is fantastic.

Since oratorios are normally not staged, it does not leave much for the singers to do physically other than sing.  The dancing really adds to the performance.  Some of the dancers act as avatars for the singers.

The costumes and sets are good and the musical performance is the best I have heard of this work.  Christopher Hogwood literally wrote the book on Handel and Danielle de Niese is a great singer and actress.  She even does her own dancing in the final chorus.

I am very happy to own this video.",1509062400,2,650,4.411764705882353
8390292,5,B003757W10,"I have viewed this piece twice and was somewhat perplexed first time. I should have done some reading of the essay in the accompanying booklet first to understand better what was involved in this rather unique composition. It is unique in that it was not originally perceived as an opera and Handel left no staging instructions. So this has left the opportunity for imaginative interpretation, something of which the director and choreographer Wayne McGregor took full advantage. He interwove the singing and (minimal) acting with a variety of ballet sequences which might appear odd at first viewing. He explains his philosophy in a very interesting 9 minute extra and this should be viewed first to get full appreciation of the production.

There is a brief illustrated synopsis on the disc but, to me, it does not help very much and a small paragraph in the booklet would have been much better to explain the very simple story of a couple of lovers Acis and Galate and shadowed by a jealous Polphemus who finally kills Acis.

The music is vintage, appealing, Handel extremely well played by Hogwood and his orchestra and beautifully sung by a cast of 50 led by the lovely Danielle de Nice and Charles Workman. I remain puzzled as to why Galatea had to have a rope like blonde wig over her lovely auburn hair but that distraction was soon overlooked as the music wove its magic. Initially the ballet dancing made little sense but after viewing the work a second time and hearing from McGregor his philosophy behind the choreography, it became more evident how much it was an important part of the production, adding significantly to viewing of the work compared to merely listening to the audio. The dancing was sensuous and excellent.

So, this production is a little gem. If you like Handel's music and are prepared to see something quite different, then you should enjoy this disc as much as I did.

8390293,5,B003757W10,"Acis and Galatea recounts the myth of the doomed love between the shepherd Acis and the nymph Galatea, based on a story from Ovid's Metamorphoses.  Although Handel did not conceive Acis and Galatea as a fully staged production with action, it takes well to the stage.  In this respect, it joins other Handel works (such as Theodora, Hercules, and Semele) that have adapted well to a dramatic treatment.

Since the characters (with the exception of the giant Polyphemus) are nymphs and shepherds, a pastoral setting is to be expected.  The costumes are slightly odd (Acis and Coridon wear ratty sweaters, for example, and Damon sports a fedora) but generally unobtrusive.  The most distinctive feature of this production is that, in most sections, the singers are doubled by dancers from the Royal Ballet, who provide a visual commentary on the text.  In the concluding section, Acis's double takes on the role of Acis himself, now transformed into a god.

Danielle De Niese (who was a knock-out as Cleopatra in the Glyndebourne Giulio Cesare) shines both musically and dramatically as Galatea.  Charles Workman (whom I first encountered as Jupiter in the DVD of Semele) is equally convincing as Acis.  (I'm especially fond of his ""Love sounds the alarm."")  The expert Handelian Christopher Hogwood conducts the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and a fine choral ensemble.

As is often the case these days, you can find extensive excerpts from this DVD on YouTube.  If you check them out, I think that you will come to agree with Handel's contemporaries, who made Acis and Galatea one of most performed of the composer's works during his lifetime.  It contains some of Handel's finest music and provides a very enjoyable evening's entertainment.

(Note: The Blu-ray and DVD of Acis have been available since March 1 in the U.K., from which I purchased my copy.)",1269043200,32,1865,4.993527508090615
