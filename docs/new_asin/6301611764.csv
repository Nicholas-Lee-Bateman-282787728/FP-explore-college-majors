7813058,5,6301611764,"The Priory School, 1986 film

The stories are based on Sir A. Conan Doyles famous short stories and faithfully adapted to film. Jeremy Brett plays Sherlock Holmes and Edward Hardwicke plays Dr. John H. Watson.

The Priory School.
A man walks into Holmes room and collapses. Principal Huxtable tells of an abduction of a student. [Holmes is crass here. The boys father is the Duke of Holdernesse, one of the richest men in Britain. What kind of tires were on the bicycle? Holmes and Watson reconnoiter the neighborhood. Tracks from cattle obscured the trail. Holmes finds the body of the German master. Holmes studied those family portraits, then talks to the Duke about his secretary. The Dukes staff searches the lands. They find a cave, an accident happens, the mystery is solved, the son saved. [Doyle tells about a scandal in the aristocracy. Did this story remind you of The Hound of the Baskervilles?]",1404259200,,907,4.883116883116883
7813059,5,6301611764,"Excellent plot, acting and setting.  The characters are well defined and acted - even the uncouth innkeeper is memorable. The school's setting, the lonely moors, the Duke's splendid home - all combine to create great atmosphere.  It is well photographed and the plot is convoluted enough to hold the attention and keep the mind busy to the end.  Jeremy Brett and Edwarde Hardwicke at their best.",1076630400,,395,4.954545454545454
7813060,5,6301611764,"I'm 25 and have enjoyed this series and the stories since I was about 10. While this dramatization isn't totally faithful to the original by Conan Doyle, I'm still not sure if I enjoy the episode or the story better!  Nevertheless it is one of my favorite in the TV series and I recommend it  to any Holmes fan or even those who like a good mystery. An excellent hour  to spend.",957657600,7,378,4.222222222222222
7813061,4,6301611764,"This beautifully photographed and acted episode has atmosphere to spare, but I wish they had left in the original ending where Holmes grossly overcharges his client after the man insults him! Holmes, and Lord  Holdernesse, are much more sympathetic characters in this adaptation.
At  least they cut the nonsense about the bicycle tires that marred the  original tale....
Edward Hardwicke is excellent as Watson and this is one  episode where the contrast between the practical (and frequently hungry)  Doctor and the cerebral and imperious Detective is particularly well  established.",940291200,5,584,5.50561797752809
