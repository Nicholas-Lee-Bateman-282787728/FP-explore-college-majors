8474847,1,B000GNOQKG,"Anyone blessed with the ability to instantly recognize land shapes from space should find this dvd fascinating. Unfortunately there is no commentary, only music, so the whole dvd had me guessing what part of the world I was viewing.

Even just a sub title of what the viewer was looking at would have improved the enjoyment of the dvd 1000%.

Anyone who can give me a run down of the images from start to finish will earn my gratitude.",1256860800,,435,4.493670886075949
