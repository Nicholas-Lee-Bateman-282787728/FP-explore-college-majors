8235862,3,B000ZKVLEY,"This film is just like the book: nothing new to offer, and a little short in length.  There are plenty of movies out there like this one.  What saves this film is the actress who plays the main character and the one who plays the grandmother are both excellent.  Oh, and if you're looking for explicit nudity, you'll only find a few topless scenes.  Worth a watch, but not ownership.",1372982400,4,383,4.428571428571429
8235863,3,B000ZKVLEY,"I'm going to speak about the movie itself, because I haven't bought the DVD (yet), it happened to be on Crackle, so I watched it.  I did enjoy this movie, on several levels.  I enjoyed looking at this young girls life through -her- eyes...  I enjoyed the depiction of her as the teenager I remember myself to be - over-brimming with hormones, passion, and always dreaming of my next kiss.  But what I particularly enjoyed was this person's transformation, step by (sometimes jarring) step into the older, wiser teenager she becomes. Several other side plots conjoin with the main plot quite well - this movie is not fluff - its path definitely caries us along, and -not- predictably so. There are trials and tribulations along this girl's path to wisdom, and they are intermixed delightfully with bits of erotic direction-changing that was fun to watch.  If you are looking for nudity, you will find a bit of it (although not enough in my opinion), but the most erotic scene in the movie (for me) didn't involve any, when she attempts to get a handsome 40-something man sexually interested, by tonguing her milkshake straw while at an outside cafe.  The way she turns on the sexual tension like a light switch just defies gravity. I gave it four stars because the story and eroticism carried it, but I would have liked to see a bit more eroticism -and- nudity. But then again I drown my hamburgers in ketchup, so there you go.",1363996800,7,1426,4.661354581673307
8235864,1,B000ZKVLEY,"I bought this DVD, but they are not originals, instead they are manual copies. Mine does not work at all and my return date expired, so in the end, I have paid for nothing. Do not buy the ITEM.",1354147200,3,193,3.9743589743589745
8235865,1,B000ZKVLEY,"How can this be advertised as ""uncut"" at 94 minutes, when IMDb lists its run time as 100 minutes, and a panned and scanned version sold by Amazon Deutchland is listed at 115 minutes?",1350259200,3,182,4.382352941176471
8235866,2,B000ZKVLEY,"There's likely to be renewed interest in this earlier 2005 film from Luca Guadagnino, but try as you might to find something that makes a viewing worthwhile, there's little here in Melissa P that indicates that this is a film by a director capable of making a film of the scale and ambition of the extraordinary I Am Love.

Based on a bestselling account of a teenage girl's exploration of her sexuality from innocent infatuation through wild abandon to self-degradation, the material here is certainly controversial, but it feels wilfully so, and in reality never produces anything that is groundbreaking or insightful on the experience of growing up.  Structured into four seasons, adopting a diary-entry point-of-view of a fifteen year-old girl, the content is appropriately juvenile, and never achieves anything like true authenticity in the increasingly absurd, clearly fantasised situations that Melissa undergoes with all the teenage boys looking like male models with their defined sculptured musculature.

There's no sign at all here of the tremendous capability to explore intense inner emotions and psychological states that Guadagnino would later demonstrate in I Am Love, but really there's little call in the material for anything other than surface impressions and superficiality, and the director perhaps appropriately gives this its due with soft-core lighting and tastefully-shot nudity.  The relationship between Melissa and her grandmother however - sensitively played by Geraldine Chaplin - is the only part of the film that has anything like a ring of truth in the story of Melissa P, or any recognisable situation that the viewer can engage with, and it is indeed beautifully handled.

The UK DVD itself looks fine, with the original Italian soundtrack in Dolby Digital 5.1 and a number of dubs provided in other languages.  Extras include a full length director's commentary (subtitled) and a standard EPK making-of.  Although advertised on the cover, there are no deleted scenes.",1276732800,2,2004,5.3630573248407645
8235867,3,B000ZKVLEY,"Based upon the book 100 strokes of the brush before bed which was pretty much an erotic novel about a young Italian girls various sexual experiences.  This is the film adaptation, the book was little special so I suppose it would be too much to ask to expect much from the film.

The film probably caused even less of a stir than the book partly due to it 1. Having the problem of dealing with what is a school girls first and soon to be numerous sexual encounters and 2. The film is just not very good.

Our young heroine falls in love with a young (rich) lad who with all the friends money can buy exploits her naive crush on him by having sex with her then leaving her.  Melissa then vows to take revenge on the world by being 'like a man' herself and engaging in as many sexual encounters as she pleases (much to the dismay of her best friend) These encounters take her on increasingly dangerous roads which included engaging in fellatio with several different boys in some backstreet basement and even going to a strangers home  who she met online.

While some may try to convince themselves this is a 'coming of age' film I cant really think of too many people I knew who had anything like a similar experience to young Melissa in their early teens and this film has all the pretentious ramblings, pointless sex and irrelivance to condemn it straight to the bargain bin of any DVD store.",1203638400,4,1393,4.400778210116732
