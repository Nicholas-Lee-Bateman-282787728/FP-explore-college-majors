8756216,5,B01DKTCAS2,"Great movie, but comes on a cheap burned disc, not pressed, not burnable M-Disc.

This review is for the product I received from Amazon. If you are after a ""Pure Movie Review"", I recommend the ""International Movie Database"". There, you will find reviews unrelated to the delivery mechanism.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc. However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for an M-Disc that would last forever. Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. A burnable M-Disc will last 100s of years.

This is a Great Movie. The image quality is excellent. Good story and well acted.",1534550400,,728,4.761904761904762

8756218,1,B01DKTCAS2,"The DVD was damaged as it plays only for five minutes and then skips several scenes, plays five minutes, then skips several scenes throughout the entire movie. I would like another DVD please so I can actually view the movie.",1483401600,,225,4.65
