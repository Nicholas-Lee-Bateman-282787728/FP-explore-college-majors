8462565,1,B004WC0L24,"This product advertises that it is the complete series. Simply, it is not. It is the first episode with a booklet containing the storyboards for said episode. It also comes with a second disc containing 4 songs from the show. It is a fantastic piece for collectors, but for anyone else, it's a sham. It is not worth the price it is selling for and I'm sorry, but you will need to look elsewhere for the series. If you wish to know more, leave a comment and I will do my best to get back to you.",1389139200,,494,4.103092783505154
8462566,1,B004WC0L24,"the product was not as advertised.
1 episode dvd is not ""complete Anime series blue-ray""
I'm disappointed and will recommend not purchasing from this store.",1385683200,,156,5.28
8462567,2,B004WC0L24,"My boyfriend bought this as a surprise gift because he knew I loved the series so much. I was SUPER excited to receive it and see the beautiful box and the fun storyboard booklet. Then I tried to play the disc and the excitement kind of wavered.

You'd expect an entire anime series to be over fifty dollars, but this isn't an entire series. Unfortunately, I couldn't even get the disc to play to actually see what this was.

This is a two-disc set and one of those discs is a CD with four songs. The other disc--well, who knows what's on it but the disc itself says ""24 mins."" Which means it's only one episode.

Do yourself a favor and don't spend your money here. Wait for the real complete series, if it ever comes.",1381968000,3,719,4.272058823529412
8462568,5,B004WC0L24,"Nothing, previously seen wanted to own to add to my own collection of dvds and different things of the sort. Take note that this is not the complete series however; it is a collectors item.",1377475200,,189,4.428571428571429
8462569,2,B004WC0L24,"As i stated in my title, this ONLY has the first episode of AnoHana. The title misled me into believe that it had the complete series, shame on me for not researching. It comes with a 4OST soundtrack and a cool little picture. Also a little book that has sketches of episode 1. The product overall would have good, but 40 bucks for 1 episode is bad. Again, just a warning.",1371081600,20,372,4.253521126760563
8462570,5,B004WC0L24,"Ano Hi Mita Hana No Namae O Bokutachi Wa Mada Shiranai is a great anime concerning love, friendship, and death. Anyone from casual anime watchers to otakus will be able to enjoy this series.

Despite this series being only 11 episodes long, I would strongly recommend this anime who appreciates a good story. I absolutely loved this movie and every episode brought me closer to every character.",1368835200,,394,4.880597014925373
