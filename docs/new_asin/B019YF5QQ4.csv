7587809,1,B019YF5QQ4,"this movie does not even deserve one star, I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I purchased this movie, this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I cannot even watch a full 20 minutes. It was nothing but garbage from the minute I hit play. I know it looks good from the appearance but trust me, do not waste your money on this movie.",1464912000,,349,3.861111111111111

7587813,1,B019YF5QQ4,"After being bamboozled by the 5-star rating given this movie, Ive come to the conclusion that that reviewer must have mistakenly given this travesty 5-stars by listing all of the films bad features (there are no good features) and totaling the results as follows:

Story Line  1-star
Special Effects  1-star
Acting  1-star
Scientific Plausibility  1-star
Entertainment Value  1-star

Total 5-stars

If ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is considered the worse film in the history of cinema, then it is obvious the person making this claim hasn't seen ""Invaders from Space.""

Note: Magellan (5-star review) gives an excellent overview of this movie, although I disagree with his evaluation.",1456963200,,681,5.289719626168225

8746269,5,B019YF5QQ4,"""Invaders from Space"" (1965) is my absolute favorite of the Starman movies.  Salamander men from the planet Kulimon invade planet Earth, the richest planet in the universe, releasing disease and general mayhem on the populace.  It is decided by the high council of the Emerald planet to send their man of steel, Starman to save the day.  I just love these old Japanese sci-fi movies and in my opinion, this one is a classic.  From the unintentionally hilarious plot, to the badly choreographed ballet-fight scenes, to Starman pausing in his fighting to mug and flex his muscles for the camera to the tight costumes that leave nothing to the imagination, this film has it all.  I think what I love most about this movie is that it exudes a sweet innocence that is sadly missing from today's more jaded cinema.  If you are a fan of old cheesy sci-fi movies in the vein of the Rocky Jones and ""Radar Men from the Moon"" serials, I think you might really enjoy this.  Highly recommended.",1509580800,3,982,4.641618497109826
8746270,1,B019YF5QQ4,"After living in Japan for ten years, I thought I was pretty used to Old Japanese sci-fi.  I even visited the bronze statue of Godzilla in Ginza.  But this was too much cheese-fi even for me to stomach.  It is rare when I won't even tough out a movie but this one is a pure waste of time - a commodity to valuable at my age to squander on crap like his.",1509494400,,352,3.861111111111111
8746271,5,B019YF5QQ4,"One of the harder to find Starman movies.  Unfortunately, they've tinted the whole movie in a light sepia-tone (similar to the package artwork).  At least it's a decent print.  And of course a must have for Starman fans",1509148800,,219,4.7105263157894735

8746273,5,B019YF5QQ4,"INVADERS FROM SPACE (1965) is the gripping tale of a plague, unleashed upon the earth. Said plague is released by the dreaded salamander men from the planet Kulimon! Now, only Starman (Ken Utsui) can stop these dastardly devils from beyond the stars! Watch, as he flips, flies, and bounds his way into our hearts! Using a combination of Kung fu, ballet, and some sort of interpretive gymnastics, Starman must defeat an army of men in amphibian pajamas! While the disease spreads, scientists race to find a cure. This all has something to do w/ a strange, modern dance performance at a particular theater. Are the dancers involved? Are they... not of this Earth?? Meanwhile, butterfly-collecting children are no longer safe! Oh Starman! Where art thou?! No, kids! Don't go into the fog! Too late! The tribal fire-dance of the salamander men has begun! Will Starman uncover the true identity of the bizarre dancers, before they destroy us all? From their secret lair, at the bottom of some aquarium, the Kulimonians plot their next move. It all just gets weirder from here, as a witch-y salamander woman is introduced. World conquest grows ever closer! Wasn't Starman in this movie? Here he comes, just in time to ballet-fu the naughty alien horde! Watching this is like discovering that our brains are made of cotton candy! You will never be the same after witnessing this madness! You'll see salamander men everywhere you look! Even in the mirror! Have no fear my friends, Starman saves!...  BONUS POINTS: For learning the salamander men roar- ""GRRRR-RRAAAHH-YYAAAHHG!!!""...",1505520000,4,1574,5.053846153846154
8746274,1,B019YF5QQ4,Really cheesy Japanese sci-fi movie.  Some of the costumes for the Emerald men look like Ku klux Klan hoods.  The rest of the special effects are worse.,1505260800,,152,4.592592592592593
