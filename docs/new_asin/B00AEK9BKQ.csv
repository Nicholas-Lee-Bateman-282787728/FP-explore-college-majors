5412739,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Set in 1988, ""The Sessions"" is an extraodinary movie based on the true-life experiences of Mark O'Brien, a then-38-year-old man paralyzed by polio, who seeks to experience physical love for the first time. John Hawke plays O'Brien, a devoutly Catholic man who nevertheless seeks the physical intimacy that disease robbed from him. Helen Hunt is a sex therapist who has 6 sessions to unlock O'Brien's fettered sexuality. And Bill Macy plays the parish priest who befriends O'Brien and gives him unoffical license to fulfill his humanity.

The film deals with the web of emotions that is unleashed by the encounters. O'Brien is gratified by the physical release he experiences, but is desperate for the human love and emotional intimacy that is normally concommitant to a sexual encouter. Helen Hunt is torn by her deep feelings for O'Brien, her professionalism and her duty to her family. And Macy struggles to leaven his role as O'Brien's priest with his role as O'Brien's friend and confidante.

There is an awful lot of nudity and frank sexuality in the film. Kudos to Helen Hunt for baring all at age 49. A great ensemble cast in a story that will make you uncomfortable while having you root for a profoundly disabled man to find the love that all of us dream of.",1357344000,14,1267,4.8341013824884795
5412740,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"The Sessions is an extraordinary little indie film based on an even more extraordinary true story.  In 1988, Mark O'Brien, a thirty-eight year old poet, journalist and advocate for the disabled living in Berkeley, California, decided to lose his virginity.  This may not sound very extraordinary unless you know that O'Brien, severely afflicted by polio as a child, had spent most of his life in an iron lung and was unable to move any part of his body below the neck.

O'Brien's decision was prompted as a result of research he was doing for an article on the sex lives of disabled people.  After interviewing a number of disabled people, and seeing how many of them were in fact enjoying an active and rewarding sex life in spite of their disabilities, O'Brien began to consider his own sex life, or rather, his complete lack of one, and how he might go about changing that.  The issue was further complicated for O'Brien by the fact that he was a devout Catholic and what he was contemplating - sex outside of marriage - was a moral issue as well as a physical one.  So in addition to consulting a sex therapist for help with his physical challenges, he also consulted with his local priest for what was for him a moral challenge as well.

It is important to understand the exact nature of O'Brien's situation.  He was not paralyzed, at least not neurologically.  Polio afflicts the muscles, leaving them weak and atrophied, but not the nerves, and so although he couldn't move, O'Brien could still feel and his 'equipment' still worked, albeit in moments that were more embarrassing than anything that could be considered pleasurable, given that the only people ever touching him or seeing him naked were doctors, nurses and attendants. And he could survive outside of the iron lung for a few hours at a time, though he had to be kept on a gurney which let him lie prone.  But this made it possible for him to do things like attend university where he ultimately earned his degrees in English and journalism (and later to have his sessions with the sex therapist). Ultimately though he always had to be put back into the iron lung as his own lungs were only strong enough to function on their own for those few hours.

The story of O'Brien's quest for non-virginity is brought vividly to life in first-class performances carried out by a marvelous cast.  John Hawkes (best known for his Oscar-nominated supporting performance in 2010's Winter's Bone) does an outstanding job as Mark O'Brien, rising to the challenge not only of portraying a man solely through the use of his head and face but also finding O'Brien's voice, bringing out his combination of intelligence and humor along with his anxieties and vulnerabilities, both physical and emotional.  Helen Hunt (best known for her Oscar-winning performance in 1997's As Good As It Gets) is equally outstanding as Cheryl Cohen Greene, the sex therapist who works with O'Brien to help him achieve his goal of becoming a fully realized sexual person, bringing out Greene's own struggle between her commitment to always maintaining a professional distance with her clients and her inability to not be moved by O'Brien's mix of raw vulnerability and nervous courage.  And his ability to find humor in spite of his situation.  ""I have to believe in God,"" O'Brien says at one point.  ""I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this.""

The supporting cast is also quite excellent.  William H. Macy does a nice turn as Father Brendan, the priest O'Brien turns to for guidance with his dilemma.  In what could easily have been a mere comic clich role, Macy instead delivers a nuanced performance as a man who seriously weighs the church's position against the sheer humanity of the situation he's been presented with and then goes with his basic humanity, telling O'Brien ""I have a feeling that God is going to give you a free pass on this one.  Go for it.""  Macy does bring a gentle humor to the situation, showing Brendan's awkward discomfort at advising someone with such an unusual problem, but gives it a solid grounding by showing Brendan's commitment to giving the best spiritual guidance he can, even if he does feel completely out of his depth.  Moon Bloodgood delivers a quietly funny performance as Vera, the supportive attendant who accompanies O'Brien on his interviews for his article and to his sessions with Greene, doing her best to be stoically professional even as her highly expressive face reveals her inner reactions to the things she sees and hears in the course of her duties.  And Jennifer Kumiyama is quite engaging as Carmen, a wheelchair-bound woman with Arthrogryposis who's cheerfully chatty about her sex life when O'Brien interviews her for his article and who ends up letting O'Brien and Greene use her apartment for their initial sessions.

As both director and screenwriter, Ben Lewin brings a special insight and sensitivity to the film, being someone who was afflicted with polio himself as a child and who must use arm braces to move about.  In addition to drawing on his own experiences while writing the screenplay, Lewin worked closely with Susan Fernback, O'Brien's partner of several years, and with Greene, wanting the script to be as faithful to O'Brien the man as humanly possible.  The music score by Marco Beltrami is appropriately subtle, present in the background and discretely adding to the tone or feel of a scene but never threatening to distract from or overwhelm what's happening on the screen.  In some movies the director depends on the score to tell you what you're supposed to be feeling, but The Sessions has no such need.

But it's Hawkes and Hunt who carry the heart of the movie and they do it marvelously well.  Hawkes' challenge is first to portray O'Brien's extreme limitations and vulnerability, and then, having done that, to get you to see beyond those things to the man O'Brien really was.  Not without some cost though.  One of the things Hawkes did was to lie on a soccer ball-sized foam rubber sphere during filming to simulate O'Brien's curvature of the spine.  However effective the results were visually, the constant pressure against Hawkes' spine resulted in him developing back problems.  Hunt's challenge was similar in that her role required her to spend a lot of her screen time naked, playing a woman who was both comfortable and professional at being naked and in a sexual situation with her clients, and then to slowly reveal Greene's growing discomfort with the fact that in spite of her professionalism she cannot be completely dispassionate about O'Brien, that there is something about him that is connecting with her and making her feel for him.  It's a tribute to the chemistry that develops between these two fine actors that the sexual aspect of their situation ultimately becomes secondary to the emotional and human connection that's being made.

In 1997, O'Brien was the subject of a short film by Jessica Yu, Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject.  In it, he makes the statement ""The two mythologies about disabled people break down to:  one, we can't do anything, or two, we can do everything.  But the truth is, we're just human.""  That, more than anything else, sums up what The Sessions is all about.

Highly, highly recommended.",1356393600,122,7405,4.846031746031746
5412741,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"How do you lose your virginity if you have been confined to an iron lung most of your life? A couple of years ago, I had some lively discussions on this topic with one of my JayFlix friends, a health-care professional who was attending a young quadriplegic. Now this film-festival favorite addresses the question, only this man isn't paralyzed with no physical sensations, instead he is a polio survivor confined to an iron lung since childhood. Furthermore, he is a witty, well-educated and frustrated adult.

Based on the real-life story of Mark O'Brien (1949-1999), a Berkeley poet and journalist, he was the first severely disabled student to graduate from college, earning a bachelor's degree in 1982, and acceptance to a post graduate program. His inspiring story has been told once before in a documentary film, ""Breathing Lessons,"" directed by Jessica Yu. It won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short in 1997. This version is written and directed by the acclaimed Ben Lewin, himself a polio survivor who requires crutches.

We watch:
  * John Hawkes (""Contagion"") is brilliant as Mark O'Brien, who wryly tells his priest he wants to experience sex before his ""Use-By date"" expires. Hawkes is an amazing chameleon who transforms himself from film to film, each time I am stunned to discover who I have just watched. There is some well-deserved Oscar buzz about this film.
  * Helen Hunt (""As Good as it Gets"") is Cheryl Cohen Greene, a professional therapist hired to provide basic instruction in human sexuality. Her therapy is bluntly anatomical and unembarrassed while at the same time, extremely sensitive and insightful. His responses are usually humorous and disarming. Hunt is fearless but convincing, and is beautifully naked a lot of the time.
  * William H. Macy (""The Lincoln Lawyer"") is Father Brendon, our hero's priest, who fears he might have unleashed some major sinning by counseling his parishioner to ""Go for it!"" This priest spent his childhood on a farm, so his observations are very forthright and practical.

This film proves two points:

  1) Our biggest sex organ is between our ears;
  2) One of the most seductive things about another person may be an ability to make us laugh. O'Brien, when asked if he is religious, replies, ""Of course I am! I've gotta have someone to blame!""

There are many happy spots in this inspiring piece and as we exited the theater, we were subdued but satisfied...smile....I'll be happy when Amazon notifies me of the DVD release.",1355443200,66,2499,4.9879518072289155
5412742,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"This is an autobiographical story of poet Mark O'Brien who was stricken by polio and spent much of his life in an iron lung.  In 1988 at the age of 38 he decides he wants to lose his virginity.  A sure bet for an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes plays O'Brien.  Hawkes' already thin frame is reduced even more to where his muscle tone approaches that of a polio victim.  His acting is mostly confined to his vocal inflections and facial expressions.

Before going much further, let's be clear about one thing.  This isn't a dower, conventional weepy film.  If anything it's uplifting.  O'Brien is a funny guy and some of the scenes between him and his understanding priest (William H. Macy) are some of the best in the film.  Once O'Brien gets the Church's go ahead, he hires a sex surrogate (excellent Helen Hunt) to guide him through his ultimate goal.  While there is nothing overly salacious in the scenes involving O'Brien and Cheryl (Hunt), they are pretty graphic.  Ms. Hunt in particular, leaves little to the imagination.

Perhaps under-appreciated in the film is O'Brien's caretakers.  One, played by Moon Bloodgood, I found particularly interesting.  I would have liked to have seen her role a bit meatier.  Perhaps it is no surprise, that in spite of O'Brien's physical limitations, he's quite the hit with the ladies, especially those closest to him.  Director and writer Ben Lewin does a nice balancing act, given the sexual and religious overtones.  The movie is well photographed giving a strong sense of reality of Berkeley, California in the late 1980's.  Excellent film.

BLU RAY UPDATE:  The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and maintains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Even for those used to seeing quality in Blu ray discs will appreciate the perfection of this issue. It is absolutely gorgeous in terms color, clarity and sharpness. I saw nothing in terms of image anomalies. This is a dialog centered film so the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track doesn't provide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds. The dialog is clear and audible throughout the film. Here is a list of extras:

5412743,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"The sessions is an amazing movie, based on the inspiring life story of Mark O'Brien particularly his article ""On seeing a sex surrogate"". John Hawkes's performance is pretty close to perfect i would say, if you compare it to actual videos of Mark O'Brien. they almost sound the same, it is amazing. helen hunt and William Macy are also great. it is a really funny movie if you are into dry humor (i seemed to be the only one laughing in the theatre most times).

5412744,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Ever since ""The Sessions"" made its smash debut at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2012, this movie has gotten the reputation of ""that movie with a lot of Helen Hunt nudity in it"", and while it is true there are a number of nude scenes in the movie, I hope you will agree that, after you will hopefully have seen this film, this movie surely is about a lot more than that.

""The Sessions"" (2012 release; 95 min.) brings the (real life) story of Mark O'Brien (played by John Hawkes), a Bay-area poet who lives in an iron lung as a result of polio when he was a little kid. In his late 30s, Mark wonders what if would be like ""to be with a woman in the biblical sense"", as he confides to his priest (played by William H. Macy). With the priest's blessing, Mark eventually gets in contact with a sex therapist, who in turn gets him in contact with Cheryl (played by Helen Hunt), a sex surrogate. Over the course of several sessions (hence the fiml's title), Cheryl gives ""body awareness"" tips and experiences. I'm not going to spoil your viewing experience by disclosing how it all plays out, but I will say that the last half hour of the movie is bittersweet and very touching, and I welled up more than once.

Several comments: first and foremost, John Hawke's performance will simply blow you away. I cannot imagine that he will not get an Oscar nomination for this. Of course, Helen Hunt's performance surely is Oscar-worthy as well, and not only because of the daring and frequent (but never exploitive) nudity. The immediate subject matter of the movie (sex for the disabled) is handled with care and grace. The buzz for this movie has been steadily growing in recent months, and I must say I was quite surprised how poorly attended the screening was which I attended a few weekends ago here in Cincinnati. Maybe it was just a coincidence. I sure hope so, as I very much enjoyed this movie from start to finish. ""The Sessions"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1354492800,29,1955,4.504225352112676

5412775,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Mark O'Brien, a gifted poet and writer and the subject of this marvelous biopic, was stricken with polio as a young child. Still maintaining sensitivity to touch, he lost the use of most muscles and lived out his life in an iron lung, with 4 hours a day outside it, aided by a portable respirator.  As we meet up with him in this screenplay, he is 38, and what still works are his great mind, his speech, his humor, and his penis.  He longs to experience intercourse with a woman, ""before the expiration date""-- his great line. Playing this role so excellently and authentically is John Hawkes. Helen Hunt is Cheryl Cohen-Greene, the sex surrogate.  She shines here in the most natural, honest way, displaying her nudity and commitment with pure grace, as she helps Mark realize his dream. William H. Macy is also extraordinary as Father Brendan, in whom Mark confides all his romantic and sexual dreams and to whom he recounts all the details of the therapy. Father Brendan compassionately suspends all judgement and becomes a great support for Mark in this sexual journey, adding that he believes God is giving him ""a free pass"" in this pursuit. Ben Lewin is the wise and insightful writer and director, who utilizes much of Mark's own writing and thoughts in the construction of this exceptional film. In fact, all filmmaking disciplines are on point. The photography is excellent. The acting is brilliant, even in the supporting cast.

Yes, Helen Hunt does a lot of nude scenes, but, if you can get over your sophomoric urges, John Hawkes does a wonderful job portraying a severely handicapped man who has adapted to his condition and demonstrates a whimsical, humorous outlook on life (no curmudgeonly, angry, dismissive stereotype here), and we see how his caregivers deal with his moods and physical needs on a daily basis.  And the physical needs issue gets explored further as we discover that he is a man of faith and spends time at his local church (he's Catholic, but it is a secondary attribute in this story).  We get introduced to the cool, hip Priest (William H. Macy) and through his interactions with the priest, we discover that the issue of sex is becoming a central issue for Hawkes' character.  After some introductory scenes with his psychologist, he gets introduced to Helen Hunt's character who is a sex surrogate.  The remainder of the movie deals with the sometimes awkward, sometimes humorous and always touching relationship that develops between John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.

5412803,5,B00AEK9BKQ,Every human being has the need to experience these emotions and relationships regardless of their situation in life.  That this is a biographical based film is of particular interest to me and I wish I had known Mr. O'Brien as he appears to have been a remarkable man.  Mr. Hawkes delivers a wonderful performance acting almost exclusively with his face.  Ms. Hunt does not disappoint. Mr. Macy is also excellent in his roll and is my kind of priest.  It wasn't what I expected but I am not sure what I was expecting.  I just know that I came away feeling like I had a different perspective on sexuality than I did before.  The body may be the only limitation one has whereas the mind and heart are all in.,1463788800,,706,4.392307692307693

I went back to watch a couple of scenes from the beginning that I wasn't paying attention to, and watched the entire movie again - and I may watch it again tomorrow.  Helen Hunt, William H. Macy, and John Hawkes were beyond superb, as were all of the cast. I'm not sure who cast the movie, but they deserve an Oscar for it.",1460851200,4,575,4.026315789473684

5412848,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Like many, I may have initially been interested in this movie for it's subject matter and perhaps an expectation of something light, humorous and a a strong cast. Well you get all those things, but mostly you get an incredibly moving and emotional experience. The cast as expected were wonderful. John Hawkes was so good as Mark O'Brien that is was probably 30 minutes into the movie that I recognized him as one of the cast of Identity - he was incredibly convincing as man smitten by polio. Helen Hunt too was a perfect choice. The real-life woman she plays (she is shown in some of the extras) was an extraordinary woman too and Helen played the role boldly.

There is nudity - Helen Hunt's character (and by extension, sex surrogates in general) are not coy. It is a comfort in fact to see a real woman - beautiful but real and age appropriate - in a movie, where there is usually so muc pressure to only show the sleekest of bodies. There is humor too - but it is the kind of humor we experience in real life - the movie is not played in any way for laughs. Nor does it overly sentimentalize Mark, his condition and his hopes. Life can be cruel but we can be lucky to encounter people who will be kind and who will love us (in whatever way they can).

This is a wonderful movie - but be prepared to be emotionally affected. I watched it alone and still couldn't avoid choking up as I watched. Why it didn't feature more in the Academy Awards is a mystery - though Helen Hunt did get nominated for Best Supporting Actress. John Hawkes deserved an Oscar nomination too in my opinion.",1441411200,7,1586,4.35472972972973

5412880,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"I liked the movie, it was quite touching in its premise.  The actors did a fine job of acting.  However it seams that the story became hijacked someplace in the making or editing.  The movie should have added more of a wider view of their lives.  I am not sure that there was enough to feel the emotion or attachment to characters.  I found myself wondering about why this happened or that took place.  I also was unable to understand why they had a segment where there was no caretaker and he almost dies.  This did not seam believable to me.
  I did not think W. Macey acting was as good either as he was in some of his other movies.  I look foreword to his take on a character which is usually unique and interesting.
  I like Helen Hunt so that is why I bought the movie.  I thought her acting was not as crisp as in some of her other movies.  I felt she did not provide the quality of the character as in some of her other movies. But overall I was glad someone told me about the movie and I bought it.
  My wife did not like this movie at all she felt the entire premise was wrong and the story dragged.  She only watched about 1/3 of the movie though.  So she did not like the idea of a disabled person wanting this type of experience.  She felt it was made for a male audience who wanted to see Ms. Hunt undressed.",1431907200,,1322,4.073929961089494
5412881,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Whats it about?

Mark OBrien (John Hawkes, Deadwood) is a poet and journalist with a sweet, vibrant mind but a polio-ridden tomb of a body. After taking an assignment to write an article about sex and the disabled, he enlists the services of a sex surrogate (Helen Hunt) to help him shed his V-plates, seeking counsel from a priest with glorious hair (William H. Macy) along the way.

What did I think?

This is a beautifully made, thoughtfully told, remarkable movie that teeters between being hilarious and unbelievably heart-wrenching. Hawkes is astonishing, effortlessly moving the audience while actually moving, like, two muscles the entire time. Hunt gives a physically and emotionally powerful performance  although her Massachusetts accent is a little wonky. Meanwhile, the always wonderful Macy is at risk of being upstaged by his hair. Fans of Deadwood will enjoy the mini-reunion among the expanded cast. A glorious piece of filmmaking.",1431820800,,948,5.258278145695364

The main character had an upbeat, dry wit, which was very disarming. Excellent acting by all of the characters. It was also very short - just 1.5 hours, which was perfect. It told the story without belaboring the hardships the main character faced. Very uplifting. One of my favorite movies this year.",1422662400,,474,4.654761904761905

5412926,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Wow! So glad my Dad recommended this movie to me! Helen Hunt is amazing! Her struggles are our struggles, in that her acting is so superb that we feel every emotion she expresses. Anyone that knows someone that has/had polio (I have a cousin) can certainly appreciate what their fate would have been had medical advances not been made when they were. A delicate topic treated splendidly!",1421020800,,387,4.791044776119403
5412927,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"The wife and I agree that this is an excellent movie.  Helen Hunt was TOTALLY fearless in her character role.  Great cast.  John Hawkes did a great portrayal of Mark O'Brien.  We enjoyed William H Macy as the priest with the ""understanding"" conscience.  Having worked with physically challenged individuals in the past, we could relate to what Mark O'Brien was going through at that stage of his life.  The social Stigma attached to impaired persons and their sexuality is still a ""dirty secret"" society wants to ignore and sweep under the rug.  Hopefully, this film and others on the same topic might start to change peoples ideas and feelings on the topic.  It is about time considering the US in now in the 21st century, but treating sexuality like it was still the early 1900's, unlike most of the rest of the ""advanced"" counties in the world.",1420588800,,847,4.714285714285714

5412934,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Surprisingly good - I had just heard the sensational reviews essentially Helen Hunt plays sex therapist and is very exposed in her scenes with a a polio survivor I assumed it was just a desperate and exploitative vehicle to:a) restart Helen's career, & b) sell movie tickets (though I cannot imagine it would have been classically popular and financially successful.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie was a very sensitive and uplifting true story that was charming and not at all sexual in nature - despite the plot",1419292800,,527,4.855555555555555
5412935,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I confess I bought this DVD because I read that Helen Hunt appears nude in the movie and being a long-time fan of Ms. Hunt's and too decrepit in my dotage to do anything but fantasize about sexuality I figured it wouldn't hurt.  Wrong again.  Oh, sure, she does appear nude but by the time that happens one has long since forgotten the anticipation of a bit of bare flesh, having been caught up in the beautifully acted tale of this heroic figure and the people who 'helped him along'.  And Ms. Hunt, taking her cue from the straight-forward woman she portrays (whom we get to hear from in the featurettes included on this disc) demonstrates what a consummate actress she is by turning salaciousness into sympathy...both for the man she assisted and for the heart-wrenching task she set for herself in so doing.  Keep a box of tissues handy...and be prepared to have your heart healed, even if you think it doesn't need it.",1419206400,,923,4.575757575757576
5412936,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"It's an interesting story based on real people. it's about sexual desires of a paralyzed man. It's totally natural from biological point of view. A priest provides consultations to diminish the psychological barrier. What surprises me is that Helen Hunt agreed to do this movie. She always gives me the impression that she is very cautious about nudity and sexual display on screen, but in this movie, she is not only completely nude but also performs intercourse, as a sexual therapist.",1419120000,,487,5.0246913580246915

5412945,3,B00AEK9BKQ,"As a sexual empowerment coach I work with people around many issues related to sex and I am so glad to see a film about sex surrogacy. But unfortunately this film demeans the work of sex surrogates and the ever important codes of conduct appropriate for professionals working with clients in this way. Clearly there was some artistic license taken in choosing to bring the same old story of jealous husband who controls wife's sexuality into this story. Any good surrogate would not just throw her professional boundaries out the window, give out her home address and fall in love with a client to the point where she leaves a session crying and forgets her paycheck. I find that highly improbable and unfortunate that the filmmaker went there, when instead, he could have chosen to address the complicated emotional terrain of transference and countertransference that can happen between professionals and clients and that indeed happens in many relationships be it therapist/client, teacher/student or sex surrogate/client. That would have made for a better film, a more realistic story and would have served to tell the story of sex surrogacy better. This film how most people learned that sex surrogacy even exists and unfortunately it leaves the viewer with a false idea of how it works and of the boundaries that are an essential part of it.

5412946,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"A very tender and moving movie (albeit, a bit of soft porn!). Helen Hunt as you've never seen her before, I suspect. She's completely naked much of the time and shows no shame. But it works. One of those weird combinations of date and chick-flick movies that you rarely find. The man will love the nudity and storyline and the woman will love the storyline and the intense connection made between the two main characters. Definitely worth watching. However, don't watch it with your parents, your children or anyone else that you don't know really well and feel comfortable with. Just sayin'.......",1415059200,,598,4.872549019607843

My neighbor who had recommended the movie thought that the main character had been dealt a bad hand. I disagree however. Anyone who had touched so many lives and was loved by 3 women who were there at his funeral was indeed a very lucky person. How many of us will die unnoticed by those around us. You have no guarantees in life. Bad things happen to good people. What matters is how you proceed from there.,1410480000,2,572,4.247706422018348

A wonderful movie based on two real people, it chronicles how one person reached out to another bringing joy to latter's life ... a life otherwise confined mostly to an iron lung.  Helen Hunt is, as always, fantastic and more than deserved her Oscar nomination for this role.  John Hawkes also deserved a nomination.  And William H. Macy as the priest was a glorious hoot!

This story is poignant and at times sad, but it also has a big dose of humor and humanity. The acting is low key for the most part, though actor William H. Macy delivers a great performance as the young paraplegic's priest.

It is a hidden, and often misunderstood topic, and this drama sheds some light on that.

While some of the turns that take place in the film are there clearly for story-telling and dramatic reasons (lost a star for accuracy), it does a fairly good job of showing how these relationships work, and the beauty they bring to those who need them.

5413033,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"If you ever carve out the time to find the documentary, Breathing Lessons, that contains interviews with Mark O'Brien, the courageous man on whose life the movie, The Sessions, is based.  I hope you will remain as touched and inspired as I was by this man who tried to live a full life in spite of the most difficult hand dealt him.  The movie, The Sessions, as most Hollywood movies are prone to do, glamorizes his life, suggests a perpetual sunny disposition and a facility with charming woman.  The real Mark O'Brien in the documentary spoke of passing many hours alone, dealing with a roach-infested apartment, and women perpetually keeping him at arm's length.  There's a bit of a disconnect there, but in spite of the Hollywood-applied fairytale veneer, there is much to celebrate in this movie.  It is hard to come away from this movie and not feel profoundly inspired by Mark O'Brien.  In spite of being imprisoned by his body and tethered to an iron lung, Mark O'Brien seemed to seek out ways to still experience the journey of life as best he could.  One can't help but revel in both his spirit and his sharp mind.

In addition, what makes this movie a very worthy watch and one to own is the virtuoso performances turned in by the two leads, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.  Both inhabited their characters with such grace and beauty.  I was particularly amazed by John Hawkes.  Playing Mark O'Brien is light years' away from the the dark figure Mr. Hawkes plays in Winter's Bone.  What versatility! It is a great shame that he was overlooked for an Oscar nomination. He was most deserving.",1385769600,,1597,4.644128113879003

Don't be put of by the sex acts on screen, they are done with good taste, yes Helen Hunt is naked, but what woman hasn't look in the mirror at their own body. What married guy hasn't seen his  wife's body (unless his in the dark). This movie brings to light a problem that some people share sex dysfunction and not being able to have a normal sexual relationship due to fears of sexual acts. I good the movie because I am a Helen Hunt fan, after watching it, I am very glad I purchased it and will watched it again very soon, not just for Helen Hunt but for the movie itself it's a very good movie and stands alone on it's own.

He finds one thing missing in life though. He wants to have sex or better yet a relationship with a woman. This is something he has never had due to his inability to perforn the physical requirements to have sex.
He finds a Sex Surrogate. Played by Helen Hunt, who does a wonderful job to show ""Mark"" how he can indeed have sex. Helen Hunt was excelletn in the role and had no quams to play the role just the way it was perfomed for real. She wasted no time performing as a woman who has no problem taking all her clothes off. I was a bit suprized in Helen's full frontal nudity in the film but she played the role so well and decently, the fact she had nothing on became secondary to the real issue. Could Mark establish a sexual relationship with someone ??
Check out the movie and find out for yourself. It's well acted, and done decently.

5413045,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Helen Hunt, have you come a long way since 'Highway to Heaven'.  In the terrific independent film THE SESSIONS, this versatile actress boldly plays a sex surrogate introducing fragile Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), a man in his thirties who has lived the bulk of his life in an iron lung, to erotica and human intimacy.  And bold may not be a strong enough word; as a surrogate Hunt's Cheryl character leaves nothing to the imagination as she helps Mark lose his virginity within the six ""sessions"" she has allotted him.  Yet I'm getting way ahead of myself.

Hawkes, a remarkable character actor, completely carries this film--and never gets off his back.  Based on a true story, Mark O'Brien is a talented poet with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor regarding his polio; he's also a hopeless romantic yearning to discover the joys of sex, augmented by a fierce Catholic upbringing, so the conflict he's feeling is dynamic, to say the least.  He befriends an open-minded priest (William H. Macy is fantastic), and, although the padre is less than comfortable with the subject matter, he nonetheless helps Mark take his journey of self-discovery.  As does Mark's helper and caretaker, Vera (a stunning Moon Bloodgood).  Mark calls upon Cheryl to help him lose his virginity, and over the course of their sessions, both persons are moved and emotionally changed.  Cheryl, especially, is touched, as she finds herself falling in love with her soft-spoken, yet eager, disabled client.  Ultimately, this puts some strain on her own marriage, as her husband (Adam Arkin) is not happy with how the sessions are progressing.  The conflicting emotions cause the sessions to end prematurely, yet Mark has been changed enough by his experiences with Cheryl to move on and actually enjoy the few remaining years of his life, culminating in a loving, long-term relationship with a warm caretaker, Susan (Robin Weigert).  *Spoiler alert!*  The film ends with Mark's funeral, where as he mentions, in narration, he's fortunate enough to have three women he's loved in attendance.

THE SESSIONS is of course an adult film, yet it is also a tender, compelling, very believable story about the never-ending will of the human spirit.  Often witty and clever, always engaging and poignant, this is a film not to be missed.

5413055,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"While contemporary entertainment is awash in graphic sexuality, the vast majority of it has all the emotional depth of a snickering adolescent boy immersed in Internet porn. Happily, that's not the case in this warm, very rewatchable true story of a disabled man wanting to experience sex before his death, and the sexual surrogate who helps him to discover the pleasures & joys of his body. But what's really impressive is how the film avoids the other potential danger of such a film -- being so noble & high-minded that it becomes ethereal, losing the necessary carnality of sex. Everything is just right here, presented with good humor, tenderness, and a refreshing matter-of-factness that never becomes too clinical & detached. Helen Hunt richly deserved her Oscar nomination, but lead John Hawkes was just as deserving & should have been nominated as well. And William Macy, as the compassionate priest who obviously cares more about the spirit than the letter of the law, provides solid support. In fact all the supporting characters add to the story -- but it's essentially a two-character drama, one that thankfully never becomes too dramatic. It feels like real life, and it deals with sex in a truly adult manner, exploring both the emotional & physical needs of human beings. It touches on loneliness, on the need for intimacy on all levels, and celebrates the lush satisfactions of the flesh. These are real bodies of real people, both vulnerable & resilient, not insanely sculpted & exaggerated cartoons. And as real people, they have complex feelings, which are also revealed in all their contradictory & wonderful aspects.

5413059,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I admit that I was skeptical about this film. After all, I read the essay ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate"" back in The Day; and I'm an admirer of the late Mark O'Brien's poetry.  I hate ""disability of the week"" movies, and I was worried this would be one.  Well, I was oh, so wrong.  The Sessions gives me hope on many levels.

HOPEFULNESS SCALE:
1) The Sessions addresses Mark O'Brien's need to fully become an adult at 38 -- both emotionally and sexually.
2) The Sessions opens with a shot of O'Brien's iron lung in his *home.* (Many folks won't even know what an iron lung is or what it does. After this film, folks'll know.)
3) Due to the subject matter, there's a lot of nudity (full-frontal female only), talk of sex and sex between an able-bodied woman and a man whose body is paralyzed from the neck down.
4)The Sessions shows people with disabilities as sensual, sexual human beings. And some as isolated human beings. (Isolation is a common problem for us.)
5) The Sessions' Cheryl explains the difference between a sex surrogate and a prostitute. (One doesn't want repeat business, the other does.) Ms. Hunt is almost normal weight as Cheryl. This makes her appear more sensual and fully adult. The Sessions between Mark and Cheryl are shown as mutually nourishing.
6) Some of O'Brien's attendants are depicted as caring and others as not so much.
7) The Priest is also shown as a caring man, who, at first, has no clue how to deal with O'Brien's long-winded, funny, and, by necessity, out-in-the-open public confessions. Over the course of the film, they become friends.
8) O'Brien was a devout Catholic in life, and he is shown to be one in The Sessions.
7) The Sessions closes with the iron lung.

STEP BACKWARDS FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS SCALE:
1) The Sessions was made with the sensibilities of the able-bodied in mind. Just sayin'.
2) Mark O'Brien was shown solely on a gurney when he's out and about. O'Brien used a specialized wheel chair, too -- and was using it during the time he was seeing Cheryl. It's a nit-picky point, but it's an important point.

On the whole, though, The Sessions broke a barrier. For once, I watched a film in which the person with a disability is a human being -- not a victim, not a courageous Polio, not a perfect construct labeled Disabled Man in Iron Lung Circa 1990. Mark O'Brien is shown to be a flawed, lonely,intelligent, humorous individual filled with longing to be loved -- and to lose his virginity before he dies. AND it's filled with quotes from the real O'Brien's writings.

Speaking as a person with multiple disabilities, I think The Sessions is a fine, if flawed, film. It treated me as an adult most of the time; and it gives our society a glimpse into a world it's just not used to seeing. The Sessions could be an excellent starting point for an interesting discussion... I recommend it highly. And --

Every character in this story was extraordinary from the Priest to every caretaker.

5413076,4,B00AEK9BKQ,I like when a disabled character is portrayed as neither extremely brave nor noble.  The woman is also not artificially selfless or sweet.  She chose this service because she felt it worthwhile.  Both of them had reasons for following through that didn't need to be explained or analyzed.

The Sessions tells the story of a man who is confined to an iron lung who is determined, at age 38, to lose his virginity. With the help of his sexual surrogate therapist (Ms Hunt) and the guidance of his priest, he sets out to make his dream a reality. The story is poignant and uplifting, however, be warned that it is also extremely graphic.  There is not one inch of Ms Hunt's nude body that you will not see and the subject matter is all about his sexual quest.

That's right, they literally have sex.  This sensitive and nuanced telling of his story demonstrates that sex is (or can be) much more than a physical experience.

5413098,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"As depicted in this film Mark O'Brien(John Hawkes) was an extraordinary man.  Despite spending the majority of his life in an iron lung unable to breathe for long stretches of time or being able to move a muscle he graduates from Berkeley and becomes a noted poet and author.  Mark is unsatisfied because at the age of 38 he is a virgin.  It's not that women don't love him because he is quite charming and has a self-deprecating sense of humor but he has not found one who is willing to consummate their love for him through sexual intercourse.  Undaunted Mark employs the service of a sexual surrogate, Cheryl Cohen Greene (Helen Hunt).  Now some would view her as a glorified prostitute as Mark's sympathetic parish priest (William H. Macy)initially does but Cheryl teaches Mark the mechanics of the sexual act but it's up to him to discover the responsibilities that go with it. ""The Sessions"" is a funny life affirming film.  Hawkes, Hunt, and Macy are all terrific.  A special shoutout for Moon Bloodgood who plays Mark's caregiver.  Bloodgood projects beauty, poise, and intelligence and hopefully I see her in future ventures.  Some may be turned off by the frankness of ""The Sessions"" but I would recommend it to the less squeamish and mature older teens who are prone to misinformation.",1372982400,,1296,4.801801801801802

5413121,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"This was based on the film ""Breathing Lessons"" by the man Hawkes is portraying. Hawkes did a very credible job of depicting the polio survivor. The film was very honest and touching in the way the surrogate needed to go about helping him. One thing the film did not portray was how she spent time with him beyond that required to help him to eat and to shave and to get to know him and his unique lifestyle. The film did portray him, a polio survivor with a less than recovered body, as still having an active and engaging mind, even though his body was very limited. It also accurately depicted his hyper sensitive sense of touch, even though the muscles were extremely weak. Excellent portrayal. I was pleasantly amazed at how well the film was done, down to the haunting (at least for survivors of iron lung treatment) sound of the iron lung that started the movie.",1370908800,,868,4.5
5413122,5,B00AEK9BKQ,Great film... Never expected what happened. Helen Hunt does a great job but is she ever brave with the nude scenes... But perfect body for the part!,1370736000,,148,4.518518518518518
5413123,4,B00AEK9BKQ,This was a really gripping story done with sensitivity and feeling.  I think Helen Hunt deserved more consideration for an Oscar.  This was far and above her best effort.,1370649600,,170,4.827586206896552
5413124,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I tell you what, if Helen Hunt isn't one of the best actresses of her time, I don't know who is. My wife and I both were blown away by this movie. The trailer doesn't do this movie any justice. While it has its moments of humor, it is all in the story as it unfolds. How does Fargo win an Academy Award while little jewels like this picture are never even considered.

Yes, there is full nudity in the film! Yes, there are scenes of a very sexual nature. But that is what makes this movie. The movie could have easily been made without the nudity and scenes of very realistic sexual intimacy. But it would not have been the movie that it is.

I have to applaud William Macy's role as well. He kept it real and grounded while adding a mixture of humor and his very own sense of awe and wonder as he met with Mark as a priest, but also as a cheerleader of sorts. How many would have imagined a priest, looking up at a figure of Jesus, and tell Mark that ""God would give him a free pass"" in his endeavor to experience physical sex and love, yes love.

While the movie may not suitable for most children, it could be a valuable lesson to a child mature enough to understand, but with a parent to guide him/her through the real story being told.",1370649600,,1240,4.136929460580913
5413125,3,B00AEK9BKQ,"According to rave reviews this story is beautiful and uniquely human.  In fact, everything a person does is human, dontcha know, and I don't understand the need to attach ""beautiful"" to every story of personal hardship and tragedy.  We seem to be the culture that needs to experience *everything* vicariously, but The Sessions isn't much of an experience.  I didn't like it, didn't hate it, but I'm sure I should have felt something and I didn't do that either.

Part of the problem, I think, is that this movie shows us way too much.  The sex scenes come off as clinical, because they are-- both in the sense that they're a ""treatment"" for the main character and in that they're about as interesting for the viewer as a medical brochure.  Tab A goes here and so on.  Why not less of that and more insight into Mark?  I think that's what the priest character was for, but then, he's distracting because his opinions make no sense for a man of the church.  Mark asks him outright if he should have sex outside of marriage, and the priest replies that, due to Mark's condition, he thinks God would understand.  That might by what your average layperson would say, but I'm pretty sure the official line of Christianity is you don't break major rules just because you feel like it.  If there was such a priest in the real Mark's life (can't find a yes or no) then I take back everything I said.  If not, the character's just plain out of place.

Even though we all do it, watching someone try to get laid doesn't scream ""triumph of the human spirit"" because whether a person is getting sex is usually only really important to that person.  When I think about it, I'd have been much more interested in a movie about how Mark got that degree he was seen receiving at the beginning, since college is a real achievement whether you can breathe on your own or not.  (And what are the logistics of that?  How do you type with your mouth fast enough to take notes?  Can he see the board?  etc.) I know a person who can't have sex is going to think about it a lot, maybe even feel incomplete for not having it, but at the end the movie literally measures Mark's worth in the number of beautiful women he's been able to attract.  We don't even see anything of his life with the woman who stays with him.

I suppose for people out there who didn't know disabled people can have sex lives, this may have been a real eye opener.  Maybe it would appeal more to someone who does watch a lot of movies about people trying to get laid, and has now decided to include a disabled person's quest for diversity's sake.  And maybe this movie really inspired some people.  That's nice.  But to me it just felt like an underdeveloped story that wasn't entirely film-worthy in the first place.  At least its boldness stands out against sappy ""cancer road-trip"" movies and the like, but it still is kind of ""so okay it's average"".",1370563200,,2901,4.428301886792453

5413130,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"If the basic premise of this film--and/or several opportunities to see Helen Hunt in the altogether--interests you, THE SESSIONS should prove worth your while. There's relatively little here that's LOL funny, but the whole lighthearted tone of the film effectively conveys some serious musings on happiness and fulfillment, religion, guilt, and numerous other things. THE SESSIONS also treats the libido in general (and the male one in particular) objectively and compassionately, as well as responding to the question, ""Exactly how important should sex be to us?"" Some of the ideas are not entirely fleshed-out (no pun intended), but the film goes just deep enough in the areas mentioned.

Other considerations:

--Excellent acting--by the supporting cast as well as Hunt and Hawkes--with ultra-realistic dialogue;

--The irony of Mark (Hawkes) confessing and seeking advice from a presumably celibate priest is not lost;

--Just knowing that this film is at least loosely based on a true story greatly enhances it;

you haven't lived until you've LOVED!)...and that is indeed what this movie is about...LOVE

5413132,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"A very unique movie.  It looks at psycology thru sexuality, in the life on a man completely paralyzed with polio.  It is rather odd watching a whole movie with a main character named Mark who looks at you sideways the whole time (due to his polio paralysis he is on a gurney or in a bed constantly).

Even though he may be considered ""useless"" by today's standards, he touched the lives of everyone he knew... There is more to the human spirit than economic success.

It is funny and entertaining, especially the parts where he speaks with the priest, (William H. Macy-great in so many diverse roles), about his ""sexual"" experiences; and the ""therapy"""" sessions.

Helen Hunt looked different, her face seemed rather poofy/baggy, but otherwise she is aging gracefully.  Another reviewer wondered why it was necessary to show a full frontal of Helen Hunt naked.  It is my belief that it was to show us what Mark was seeing, so we could empathise better.  (Also, maybe that's what Hunt has to do to get a decent paycheck these days?)  I have noticed in recent movies, that there is at least one full frontal shot(mostly female but some male).

Reminds me of the sexual movements of the 70s (though I wasn't around then), if you've seen 70's movies, they also unabashedly used nudity bc it is natural after all, not ANYTHING to be ashamed of (though individually something to be revered and protected).

I like that the movie forces us to think about sexuality for what it truly is (rather than the way narrow-minded society shoves down our throat--no pun intended) as a complement to feel-good human emotions, not the only means to happiness.  It reminds us that there is more to life. Which is funny cuz its mostly about one man's journey to being sexual.

5413165,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Movie: 5 Stars  Extras: 2.5 Stars

During the 50th Annual American Atheists Convention in Austin, Texas, I had the good fortune to run into Dr. Darrel Ray, author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-God-How-Religion-Distorts-Sexuality/dp/0970950543/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex & God: How Religion Distorts Sexuality</a>. After I explained my situation to him (somewhat similar to that of the movie's main character), he graciously took time to have a private conversation with me and offered some possible solutions to my issue.  One suggestion he made was to watch ""The Sessions"", as according to him it gets a lot right about sexual therapy.

The movie is based on the true story of journalist Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), who as a child became paralyzed from the neck down by polio.  At the age of 38 he decided it was time to lose his virginity, and encouraged by a sympathetic priest (William H. Macy) he ends up hiring sex therapist Cheryl Cohen-Green (Helen Hunt).  At first their relationship is somewhat awkward, but as time goes on they develop a closeness that awakens jealousy in Cheryl's husband (Adam Arkin).

The performances of all the principles are uniformly excellent, with Mr. Hawkes and Ms. Hunt as the standout actors of the ensemble.  Their interactions were so frank and intimate I almost felt like an intruder while watching them.  After the movie ended, I checked out the sparse but informative extras, although this was one film where a commentary was sorely missed.  However, at least I was able to purchase Kindle books by the real Mark O'Brien:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-I-Became-a-Human-Being-A-Disabled-Man-s-Quest-for-Independence-Wisconsin-Studies-in-Autobiography/dp/B009VNXVXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How I Became a Human Being: A Disabled Man's Quest for Independence (Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography)</a>&nbsp;and Cheryl Cohen-Green:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-Intimate-Life-Sex-Love-and-My-Journey-as-a-Surrogate-Partner/dp/B00A2N81BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An Intimate Life: Sex, Love, and My Journey as a Surrogate Partner</a>.

I was also able to find an online article written by Mark O'Brien about his time with Ms. Cohen-Green, and the movie hews fairly close to his actual experience, although some dramatic and relational liberties were taken by the filmmakers.  I'm thankful that Dr. Ray recommended ""The Sessions"" to me, although I'm not sure I'm ready to hire a sex therapist at this stage in my life.  But I'm glad the option exists, and that this movie was able to portray the controversial subject of sexual therapy in such a dramatic yet accessible manner.

5413167,2,B00AEK9BKQ,"Very little according to the sex surrogate Cheryl played by Helen Hunt.  The difference, ""I don't want your return business."" This odd film implies that the Catholic Church represented by a hip priest has no problem with Cheryl's type of legal prostitution. The voyeuristic priest takes all of 30 seconds to give the protagonist, Mark, assurance that Jesus will give him a pass for becoming a john. The priest never once mentions that the time to get a therapist (not surrogate) is when you are in a committed monogamous relationship (ideally marriage) and you have issues you cannot resolve as a couple. But why not? Even Cheryl's husband calls her a ""saint"" for having sex with other men, although he draws a firm line at her receiving poems from them. The only real sin in the movie is when Cheryl begins to have feelings for Mark--evidently a no-no for women in her profession. If the film had examined this theme, it might have stumbled upon redemption, i.e. that the sexual act always effects the body, soul and mind and there are consequences to so-called ""casual"" sex of any kind, ""licensed"" or not.",1368835200,2,1107,4.765625

5413175,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"The Sessions is a beautiful story about a man (Mark O'Brien) who was severely disabled by childhood polio.
outwardly, the story focuses on Mark experiencing a sex life despite his physical limitations.
to me, the heart of the story is Mark having the courage to live life fully and experience it as deeply as possible.
the reward is the experience of being engaged by other people as a human being.
not just as a crippled body with needs.  a disabled human yes, but a human first and foremost.

The Sessions really moved me.
in turns, i was embarrassed, comforted, saddened, inspired, and delighted.
for 95 minutes i forgot about everything else and was completely absorbed by the story.
the most touching and uplifting aspect is feeling that Mark knew what it felt like to be seen as a beautiful man by some special people in his life instead an aging boy in an iron lung.

i've looked forward to seeing this film since reading Marks essay ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate"" several months ago.  the essay can be found online by searching on its title.  with the run-up of good things that i've heard about The Sessions, i was afraid that my expectations were running so high that the movie couldn't live up to its promise.  i definitely am not disappointed.

there is nothing about The Sessions that i don't like.
the sex is handled tastefully but not prudishly.
the cast is outstanding all around.  John Hawkes is super convincing as Mark.  Helen Hunt is perfect as Cheryl (the sex surrogate).  absolutely love William H Macy as the priest. Mark's interactions with Macy's character kind of tie everything together and keep the story moving forward.

i think we would all prefer to be seen as the complex and beautiful people that we are.
not just a sum of our body parts, abilities, possessions, etc.
in order to achieve this, we'll need to exercise the kind of courage that Mark O'Brien did.
that's why i think this movie speaks to everyone.",1368403200,,1939,4.673529411764706

It's an episode in the life of Mark O'Brien, a 38-year-old surviving in an iron lung and wanting to become a normal person. It is inspiring. But becoming so-called normal is definitely not for prudish viewers. O'Brien (John Hawkes)  does not want to die a virgin and seeks advice from his priest (William H Macy) with unexpected results. Helen Hunt, acting the role of his sex therapist, along with others, is brilliant. O'Brien, in reality, is a university graduate,poet and journalist achieving magnificently against the odds. His work has achieved a lot for disabled people who were sent to institutions regardless of their intellect. I have since obtained a Kindle version of the book, How I became a human being. (from Amazon of course) to learn more of this remarkable human being who died aged 49. Expecting the book to be as good as the movie, I am in for a great read. The extras with the DVD give inspiring backgrounds of actors and O'Brien himself.",1368144000,,1020,4.762711864406779

What if you want loveless sex but can't separate your feelings?  Sounds like real life for any of us.

5413192,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"A poet in an iron lung is looking to have sex for the first time in his life. This sounds like a mix of a Lifetime Movie of the Week and a raunchy Judd Apatow sex comedy, but it's the furthest thing from both. Director Ben Lewin and amazing performances by its leads and supporting cast have crafted a mature, frank and life-affirming film about living a complete life; spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

The film itself, set in 1988, is based on the real-life story and writings of Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes, who, after being in small roles for the last 15-odd years, has been making a significant name for himself lately in indies like WINTER'S BONE and MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE), a Berkeley area poet and writer who, after stricken with polio as a child, spent most of his life in an iron lung. He's never had a girlfriend and, aside from his assistants, lives a very solitary life. He does also lead a spiritual life, though, and often confides in his parish priest, Father Brendan (a wonderful William H. Macy). He falls in love with one of his assistants, the beautiful Amanda (Annika Marks), but she doesn't or can't reciprocate. He is called on by the magazine he writes for to get an article about sex and the disabled. He hires a new stone-faced, yet compassionate assistant, Vera (Moon Bloodgood of TERMINATOR: SALVATION and TV's BURN NOTICE), who helps him with his interviews. He then realizes that he desires the closeness and the intimacy of sex, which might then lead to the closeness and intimacy of love. He enters into a professional relationship with a sex surrogate, Cheryl (Helen Hunt, who has been MIA of late), who looks to help him with his unique challenge, but becomes professionally conflicted when she sees his soul laid bare as she helps him explore his still burgeoning sexuality.

While this isn't a particularly amazingly visual film, flair is not necessary when you have a film that is packed to the hilt with strong and vital performances, powerful, funny and real dialogue, and a performance like Hawkes's to build around. His performance is flawless; there isn't a single note of his work in this film that you don't believe or don't see him vanish into the persona and physicality of O'Brien, and it still surprises me that he didn't make the cut for one of the actors in Oscar-nominated roles in 2012. It helps to make the strong performers around him that much stronger. Hunt, who I felt for quite some time was overrated as anything other than a sitcom actress, is absolutely stunning here as Cheryl. She never over-extends into a realm of melodrama, which it could have easily done. She's not quite in the same ballpark as Hawkes is, but it certainly close. Macy continues a streak of great supporting performances as the practical, down-to-earth Father Brendan. He's the kind of priest that everyone wished they had. Credit is also deserved my Bloodgood, Marks, Adam Arkin (as Cheryl's philosopher husband), W. Earl Brown (whose been in just about every film and TV show in the last fifteen years) as Mark's nighttime assistant and Rhea Perlman as the Mikvah Lady.

Lewin never allows the film to get bogged down in the more melodramatic elements of the film and continues to show Mark's life as well as Cheryl's as their feelings begin to circle around each other's orbit as he sees her as a surrogate for all of his intimacy needs and she sees him as a true innocent and romantic. The film is also peppered throughout by some breezy comedy that never comes across as forced and a sense that all things are possible. The scenes of sexuality and nudity, and the narration of the events, are graphic, but more importantly, they're dealt with with frankness and a tenderness that few films about sexual experience are.

THE SESSIONS is one of those great films that goes under many people's radar, but once you see it, you'll realize that this is one of the best films of 2012 and a woefully underseen and underrated and undeniably beautiful film.",1367712000,,3996,4.737068965517241

5413219,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"My husband rented ""The Sessions"" last night and initially I balked at watching it. A severely disabled man's yearning to experience intimacy, his confessions to his Catholic parish priest, and his intimate sessions with his sex surrogate just seemed a tad weird for me, but it was a slow night and I thought I'd give it a try.

I am immensely glad I did because this movie proved to be an immensely engaging viewing experience. Yes, the very subject nature of the film makes it one of those awkward movies, and there is certainly a fair amount of frank and explicit discourse on sex, the main character expounding on his sexual angst and yearnings, and of course some explicit sexual situations. Yet, the movie is grounded and credibly portrays the main character's struggles to come into his own, to claim his manhood and to learn how to have a satisfying sexual relationship.

John Hawkes plays a 38-year-old severely disabled writer, Mark O'Brien, who needs to be in an iron lung for most of his waking hours. Overcome by a desperate need to experience sexual intimacy (he can't even masturbate, but is capable of achieving a full erection), Mark decides to confess his yearnings to his parish priest, Father Brendan, played by William H. Macy, who acts as his confessor/confidante. Mark eventually hooks up with sex surrogate Cheryl, played by Helen Hunt, and this is where the movie truly takes off. Each scene between Mark and Cheryl packs an emotional wallop, their interactions coming across as credible and poignant as they gently navigate the awkwardness of the situation - Cheryl playing the role of the experienced tutor/therapist/surrogate who gently guides Mark from learning the essentials of foreplay to actual intercourse. It sounds so clinical putting it here in writing, but their on-screen chemistry makes it appear these two individuals are not merely playing a part but are the characters they inhabit.

It is a revelation of a film, and its frank portrayal of sex and the disabled is to be commended. It would not have been something I would have chosen to watch, but now that I have, I'm glad I did. The main cast does an amazing job with Hawkes delivering an Oscar-worthy performance (he is definitely turning out to be a great character actor), and Hunt is as always a magnetic presence on screen (she does bare all for this role). The secondary characters did well too - William H. Macy does a credible job in his role as father confessor/confidante and Moon Bloodgood as Vera, Mark's able aide who develops a soft spot for him.

Far from being depressing and bizarre, I actually thought ""The Sessions"" was thought-provoking, honest, and grounded, not to mention entertaining.

5413223,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"To be born with (or subsequently contract) a severe physical deformity consigns one to an often lonely interior world of the mind -- life restricted as much by one's own mental struggle as the more obvious physical challenges.  And because human beings are nothing if not social beings, adjusting to the ""normal"" world of others is the greatest obstacle such a child/adolescent faces.  Upon achieving adulthood, the expression of one's sexuality, while central to our species as a form of communication in that social setting, very often takes a back seat to other more immediate needs.

This film is a rare look at our world from the inside out.  The task here is not to perform or to practice, or even to initiate.  The goal is connection one person to another at the most profound and basic level.  A form of communication and intimacy which many take for granted is explored from our POV, and handled with sensitivity, humor, compassion, and empathy. I appreciated being a part of this journey, and felt connected as well, if only because many of the thoughts and emotions expressed are the very ones I too have known so well.",1367193600,,1130,4.769230769230769

5413235,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"This is an autobiographical story of poet Mark O'Brien who was stricken by polio and spent much of his life in an iron lung. In 1988 at the age of 38 he decides he wants to lose his virginity. A sure bet for an Oscar nomination, John Hawkes plays O'Brien. Hawkes' already thin frame is reduced even more to where his muscle tone approaches that of a polio victim. His acting is mostly confined to his vocal inflections and facial expressions.

Before going much further, let's be clear about one thing. This isn't a dower, conventional weepy film. If anything it's uplifting. O'Brien is a funny guy and some of the scenes between him and his understanding priest (William H. Macy) are some of the best in the film. Once O'Brien gets the Church's go ahead, he hires a sex surrogate (excellent Helen Hunt) to guide him through his ultimate goal. While there is nothing overly salacious in the scenes involving O'Brien and Cheryl (Hunt), they are pretty graphic. Ms. Hunt in particular, leaves little to the imagination.

Perhaps under-appreciated in the film is O'Brien's caretakers. One, played by Moon Bloodgood, I found particularly interesting. I would have liked to have seen her role a bit meatier. Perhaps it is no surprise, that in spite of O'Brien's physical limitations, he's quite the hit with the ladies, especially those closest to him. Director and writer Ben Lewin does a nice balancing act, given the sexual and religious overtones. The movie is well photographed giving a strong sense of reality of Berkeley, California in the late 1980's. Excellent film.

The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and maintains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Even for those used to seeing quality in Blu ray discs will appreciate the perfection of this issue.  It is absolutely gorgeous in terms color, clarity and sharpness.  I saw nothing in terms of image anomalies.  This is a dialog centered film so the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 audio track doesn't provide much in the way of surrounds other than ambient sounds.  The dialog is clear and audible throughout the film.  Here is a list of extras:

5413237,5,B00AEK9BKQ,So glad that my boss left early one afternoon and I decided to watch this movie!  Very brave performances by the actors in the main rolls.  And to think this movie is based on a true story.  Heart breaking and inspirational at the same time.  Watch this movie!,1366848000,,260,4.354166666666667
5413238,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"This movie was very clever and humorous. I bought it because I like Helen Hunt and wanted to see more of her. Boy, did I ever. Unfortunately, I purchased it prior to a flight from Seattle to Denver and felt overly conspicuious with the nudity (the movie, not me). I finally turned it off and watched the remainder in the privacy of my home. Good adult viewing with good actting but not for airplanes. gp",1366848000,,403,4.386666666666667
5413239,5,B00AEK9BKQ,This is a wonderful true story and Helen Hunt and all of the actors are wonderful.  Helen Hunt should of won the academy award for her performance.  I would recommend this movie.,1366761600,,178,4.53125
5413240,4,B00AEK9BKQ,It must have taken an significant amount of courage for a world class actress to carry this role but she did it with such normalcy that I was amazed.  I'm an even bigger fan and she should have gotten the Oscar.,1366761600,,211,4.146341463414634
5413241,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"All the actors do a remarkable job telling this true story. Definitely R rated.

I loved how humor was used to approach the subject and the side story about getting advice from the Priest was great too. Definitely worth watching.",1366761600,,229,4.725
5413242,5,B00AEK9BKQ,The Sessions had me alternatively laughing and crying. What a great movie! Watch it. You'll be better off for it.,1366761600,,113,4.7

5413244,3,B00AEK9BKQ,"This was an interesting movie about an individual trying to balance his spirituality with his sexuality, while enduring a very debilitating and life-threatening physical condition. I thought all of the characters were placed in situations that for many people would be uncomfortable. Helen Hunt's character is still a puzzle to me and I have to wonder if she took the role just so she could show off a fabulous physique at age 49. Fundamentally I think the movie was well directed, shot, etc., but I just didn't care for the story in general. Somehow I felt like I was intruding in very private--well--sessions and breaching a therapeutic and spiritual confidentiality. I didn't think Helen Hunt's performance rose to the level of an Academy Award nomination, but then I'm a Midwesterner with different expectations of actors than my coastal friends. But overall, this was an okay movie, but not one that I would watch again or tell someone that it's a ""must see"" film.",1366761600,,969,4.950920245398773

5413249,2,B00AEK9BKQ,Did not like this movie. Not what I expected from Helen Hunt. Would not recommend to a friend. The previews were misleading.,1366588800,,124,4.681818181818182

5413251,5,B00AEK9BKQ,I was surprised how beautifully this movie was made.  It defintiely should have been up for best picture!  The acting was superb and the story intimate and intriquing.,1366588800,,167,4.928571428571429
5413252,5,B00AEK9BKQ,Thought about this movie the other day and looked it up just for kicks.  Glad I did.  Wanted it for the actors and have an old tv set-up so can't really comment on video quality.  Got what I wanted.,1366588800,,198,4.0256410256410255
5413253,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I had no idea what to expect, but reviews at the time of this movie's release piqued my interest. It truly is an excellent movie. Instead of a depressing story of a polio survivor trapped for all but four hours a day in an iron lung, it was the story of a man determined to live life as fully as his condition would allow, with a lot of humor interspersed throughout the story. Anyone looking for pornographic entertainment is going to be very disappointed, because the nudity and the sexual scenes in the movie were very tastefully done, and all of the actors were outstanding in their roles.",1366588800,,593,4.5

5413256,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Had read something somewhere about it.at first i felt a little uncomfortable and weird watching this by myself..but after it was all said and done i look at this a whole lot different. I think it really portrays that we are all human and share the same basic need to love and be loved. ""NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION IS""",1366502400,,319,4.333333333333333

5413259,2,B00AEK9BKQ,"This movie got some very positive press before its release, so I was looking forward to watching it. To my disappointment the story wasn't very believable and characters were somewhat flat. I expected Helen Hunt to shine in this film; however, her character seemed bored and cold. If it wasn't for William H. Macy, who nailed his role beautifully, this movie would have been closer to a straight-to-dvd material.",1366329600,,412,4.9855072463768115
5413260,3,B00AEK9BKQ,"I enjoyed the movie, both actors are magnificent. The want would be that they would live happily ever after, but alas it isn't the Hallmark Channel. Enjoyed it however.",1366329600,,168,4.827586206896552

5413263,4,B00AEK9BKQ,Really enjoyed this movie most of us never see the other side of handicapped life.  I though both Helen Hunt and the guy you played Mark were really good in this story.,1366329600,,168,4.25
5413264,1,B00AEK9BKQ,"All I can say is I didn't finish this movie...very disappointed!!!!  Too much nudity and subject matter that I'm not sure why anyone would be interested in watching!  I usually like Helen Hunt (which is why I picked this movie), but I was disappointed in her and this movie.",1366329600,,274,4.571428571428571
5413265,5,B00AEK9BKQ,A very good movie.  I was not aware of it until mentioned at The Oscars!!  I recommended my daughter view it.,1366329600,,109,4.142857142857143

5413267,4,B00AEK9BKQ,Movie was funny and engaging. Slightly awkward to watch at first but it is a great story. Recommend for sure.,1366329600,,109,4.5
5413268,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Helen Hunt is - as usual - miraculous (if that comment isn't oxymoron).  All the acting captivates.  Despite the occasional clich&eacute; (surprising given the substance and insight of most of the dialogue!), the emotional honesty, unembarrased frankness, and nobility of character everywhere else on offer here are profoundly moving.  A very rich experience!",1366329600,,359,5.735849056603773
5413269,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Wow, I was blown away by John Hawkes and it's so good to see Helen Hunt back on the scene.  Lots of full frontal nudity from Helen in this one, I was kind of shocked and wondered why it was even necessary.  So, know that going into it if that sort of thing bothers you.  Definitely not one for 18 or younger to be in the room because of that, otherwise, I highly recommend it.",1366243200,,376,3.986666666666667
5413270,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I've been an avid fan of Miss Hunt since Mad About You...and I feel this  is her finest work. The movie deals with a subject most of us wouldn't think about. Sex, desire, curiosity, fear and courage with those we think less likely. This movie is graphic beyond the nudity so beautify shared here. The emotions are raw and real and honest. It's an adult movie I saw and knew that I must have..this one's a keeper...see it with someone you love...",1366156800,,445,4.426829268292683
5413271,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"This was a delightful and surprising film about a physically challenged man who wanted to experience life and not allow his disability to limit him. Hellen Hunt is one of our favorite actresses and does not disappoint in this film. William H Macy also plays an excellent supporting role. If you're squeamish about sex, this is not for you, but if you want to experience the indominable spirit of a young man stretching himself beyond what others tell him he can be, it is a delightful film.",1366156800,2,490,4.64367816091954
5413272,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"This was quite good, but very sad. Helen Hunt is a remarkable actress and John Hawkes and Macy were fantastic. The movie made you laugh and cry. It was a truly great movie and shed light on a subject that so many people do not want to talk about, the challenges a handicapped person goes through. I am very glad someone thought to bring this subject to the forefront. It is a subject that needs to be discussed.",1366156800,,411,4.282051282051282
5413273,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"OK, so even if I wasn't a 'Mad About You' fan from back in the day, I would enjoy Helen Hunt naked.  It is a very good, based-on-a-true-story watch even without that, with un-condescending dialogue and humor.
And Helen Hunt.  Naked.

5413275,5,B00AEK9BKQ,Well acted portrayal.  Funny yet profoundly touching and intelligent film.  Inspiring story.  I laughed and cried and am still thinking about it a good deal days later.  I'm happy to be reminded such people did or do exist and to see them thus portrayed.  I loved it.,1366156800,,267,4.595744680851064
5413276,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Proof that there are all kinds of `true stories' to be told; `The Sessions' is a very different kind of biopic.  Telling the story of Mark O'Brien, `The Sessions' is a sweet hearted look at one man's struggle to lose his virginity.

Mark is a paralyzed poet who spends most of his time in an iron lung and has limited communication with people outside of his helpers and his priest.  Mark eventually decides that he wants to have sexual relations with a woman and so, with the support from his priest he decides to contact a sex therapist.  That is when he meets Cheryl.  Cheryl is a middle aged woman who serves as a sex surrogate.  She'll give Mark six sessions where he can explore his sexuality with Cheryl and eventually have relations with her.  That will be his introduction to the world of sex, and from there he is on his own.  Being nervous and inexperienced, and being in a condition that isn't always accommodating, his first few sessions don't pan out as expected, but eventually he gets the hang of things.

The great thing about `The Sessions' is that it really steers far away from being overtly sympathetic.  It never demands that we mourn over Mark's condition.  Instead, we celebrate his freedoms and the way that he handles his predicament, never making it a sore spot or allowing it to hold him back.  His supreme optimism in the face of the unknown is admirable, and the light hearted approach to his plight helps put things in perspective.  I also found both John Hawkes and Helen Hunt to be delightful here, especially Hunt, who manages to ease herself (and the audience) into every scene.

Such a natural performance.

I do wish that `The Sessions' felt a bit heavier in parts.  The light hearted tone, while effective in not being reduced to the expected, also becomes a tad overdone to the point where the impact of this particular story is deadened in the end.  When all is said and done, it leaves the audience with a bit of `is that what this was all about', and that wasn't expected.  Still, I recommend this because it approaches a very taboo subject from a different vantage point and serves up an inspiring story we could all learn from.",1366156800,2,2171,4.580310880829016
5413277,5,B00AEK9BKQ,Since  I only use a wheelchair I understand and feel the same emotions. It is a moving film that speaks of another kind of heroes with other kind of goals in life. Really worth a while.,1366156800,,185,4.138888888888889
5413278,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Great story line, to say nothing of Helen Hunt. It is a wonderful relationship that helps a man believe in himself",1366070400,,114,4.476190476190476
5413279,5,B00AEK9BKQ,The actor and actress were exceptional and taught me that everyone regardless of condition must have their emotional and physical needs met to enjoy being human.  The film certainly cleared up some mistaken opinions in this household.,1366070400,,234,5.324324324324325
5413280,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Great movie, great acting! Very touching. Highly recommend! Absolutely loved all of it. You would have to have a heart made of stone not to feel touched by this story. The fact that it's true made it even more touching.",1366070400,,219,4.5
5413281,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"With outstanding performances by John Hawkes, Helen Hunt and William Macy, this is one of those movies that didn't get a lot of publicity but deserves so much more.

5413284,5,B00AEK9BKQ,Always loved Helen Hunt in whatever she's in and this is no exception.

Congratulations to all involved in this portrayal of a real life situation which is handled with grace and class!,1365897600,,323,5.09433962264151
5413285,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"This is one of the most amazing films I have ever watched. It touched me to the core and made me smile, laugh, and cry at the same time.

It is the true story of a young man, confined to an iron lung for the majority of his life, who wants to learn what love is all about before he dies. He's not just interested in the sexual side of love, he wants to know what it is to love and be loved by another person.

With the help of his priest, personal attendants, a sex therapist (surrogate), and an amazing young lady that saw far more to him than his disability, he is able to experience true love in all its physical and emotional wonder and glory.

I am not usually comfortable with videos that contain graphic sex scenes and this one has some of the most graphic scenes I have ever watched. Amazingly, I didn't feel any of the usual discomfort I feel when seeing sex scenes that do absolutely nothing to further the plot. Those scenes make me feel cheap--like a voyeur.

The sex scenes in this film were so tender and beautiful that they made me rejoice in the ability of two people to share something so deep and personal. It portrays the act of ultimate giving of oneself to another.

I am so glad I came upon this video. My thanks to all of the reviewers who gave it a great rating so that I felt viewing it would be worth the risk of it being just another sex-saturated film.",1365811200,,1380,4.192452830188679

5413290,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"One of the top ten movies of the year.  Not a bunch of CGI like most today, it is like everything is a cartoon  no real acting.  This one is far superior.  This is acting between two poeple, simple yet complex. Helen Hunt was amazing  again,  Somewhat like the movie  Water Dance  she did in her early year where her boyfriend was a Quad.  This time her leading man was amazing  keeping up with her the whole movie.  Helen Hunt is sort of a classic actress to me,  very  beautiful  but with the beauty we knew growing up.  Not all the make up , the tatoos, by the way  wasn't long ago you only saw a tatooed woman in a freak side show, to me that is where they should have stayed.  But back to the movie.  I admit alot will watching it just to see Helen Hunt nude as much as she is ,but please try get past that and see the true meaning behind the movie.  I am some what disablied not anywhere close to what he was in this movie.  Helen showed caring and understanding,  wish I could give it more then 5 stars .  A special message to all our veterns, Welcome Home and to those serving in harm's way  come home safe, god bless  and thank you ...",1365724800,,1144,4.026905829596412

5413300,3,B00AEK9BKQ,"It's OK but I thought Helen Hunt was not right for the part. It would have been better with a young Julia Roberts. She would have given this important theme (after all the dimension of sex is not to be neglected because an individual is paralyzed) a lighter touch: serious but not solemn. Just didn't quite work for me. When they finally went at it, there was post coital melancholy instead of elation. I would recommend this to psychologists.",1365465600,,443,4.620253164556962

5413312,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Depicting ""real life"" stories on the screen is always diffiicult, and this one clearly presented special challenges -- an intensely personal human journey, a controversial therapeutic discipline that isn't well understood by the public, and sexual issues that could have been badly mishandled. Thanks to poised, intelligent performances by John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, the potential pitfalls were not only overcome but transcended. Excellent supporting cast -- especially the always-remarkable William Macy, as a Catholic priest who makes a leap of faith and counsels Mark O'Brien before and during his ""sessions"" with sexual surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Green.",1365292800,,654,5.822916666666667

I didn't hear much while it played in theaters, but Helen Hunt's Oscar nomination poked my curiosity. I recognized John Hawkes as the tortured suicide in the opening of the 'Miami Vice' movie and the uncle in Winter's Bone. His poignant performance here inspired me to look up Ben Lewin (writer-director) and the real-life character. I'll look for more of their films at Amazon Instant Video. The Sessions makes me appreciate my blessings and opportunities to live life in joy.",1365033600,,616,5.049019607843137

This movie, of course, is not about corporal nudity, but about emotional nudity. The protagonist of the movie is emotionally raw (no, not like the Hulk, think more like Mother Teresa) and has some sort of Midas touch with women. I won't say more not to spoil the movie, but suffice it to say: I was surprised with and impressed and even touched by the movie.",1365033600,,552,4.216981132075472

5413338,1,B00AEK9BKQ,"Absolutely awful.  Senseless nudity, though Helen is in great shape for her age. Helen Hunt is a wonderful actress and this movie did not do her justice.

5413342,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Amazing story and acting by the lead character, and who he is/was.  Very inspiring.
I thought it should've been NC-17 if that still exists.  (Very graphic and explicit sexual
scenes, so keep that in mind if you choose to watch this with someone who might not
be ok with that or might be too young for that or who struggles with staying away from
porn.)",1364860800,,352,4.4

There were a few places where I squirmed a bit because I thought the sex was more graphic than was comfortable for me, we each have our own limits,  but the director cuts to another scene usually humorous breaking the tension. Mark is a young man who had polio as a child and lives most of the time in an iron lung. He's a writer and has a life but not a love life. The movie revolves around how he acquires one. I loved the main characters. It was a wonderful movie but NOT FOR CHILDREN!",1364860800,,588,4.157894736842105

Too many people that do not suffer from disabilities, whether physical or developmental, feel that the disabled are without ""normal"" human emotions and desires. Nothing can be further from the truth. In the movie, based on an article written by a disabled man, we see caretakers both compassionate and mean-spirited. The main focus, however, is on the interaction between this man and a sex surrogate who helps him achieve the goal of engaging in sexual activity despite his physical limitations. Threaded through this tapestry of a story are the frank and open discussions between this disabled yet religious man and the local parish priest which provide some of the movie's lighter moments.
If not for the nudity, which is integral to the telling of the story, this movie should be required viewing for everyone past elementary school age.",1364601600,,903,5.149659863945578

I wish to commend Mr. Hawkes' and Ms. Hunt for possessing and displaying the courage to bring Mr. O'Brien's life story to the general public via the ""Big Screen"".

5413381,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Better than I expected. Well done, low keyed drama about a paralyzed man seeking a sexual experience. The most salient experience however is that of the man and the people he touches with his personality. John Hawkes, Helen Hunt are excellent. Thoughtful movie, worthwhile experience.",1364083200,,284,5.333333333333333
5413382,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Oh, here is a remarkable presentation of sexuality without ""being sexy"" about it.  Mark O'Brien (from a true story played by John Hawkes) leaks that lovely honesty that allows self-awareness to flower.  I don't know how I dare admit it, but I shared this movie with a friend the other night, and then watched it again the very next night--having already seen it at least 4 times!  I guess I'm one of the ""beautiful women"" who succumbed to the outright beauty of the man himself (women who show up at his funeral at movie's end).  The Mark John Hawkes gave us is simultaneously chld-like, masterfully self-aware right from the get-go--(no doubt from the journaling and poetry he'd mastered, even from an iron lung)--easily self-mocking, easily able to seek the friendship of a priest who will sanction his pursuit of a very, very difficult goal.  Mark, ""a Polio,"" has the opportunity to seek the services of a ""Sexual Surrogate.""  So, though he ""appears"" a simple man, John Hawkes' appropriation of him shows a complexity that continues to draw me back and back. And adding to that, the excellent presence in this story of three caretakers brings us especially Rod and Vera, who were also shown with stellar ability to be in the present and simply accepting of Mark's dependencies, while wholly aware of his ""personhood,""  These all just puff this movie bigger and bigger.  Vera--who's initial appearance is shown as being reservedly assessing---just grows and grows into an inveterate side-kick--a beautifully sound compadre to ""have one's back.""

As much as I've watched this movie now, the more critical I become of the sex therapist, Cheryl, whom Helen Hunt actually quite superbly renders. It is not at all clear why she became so wrapped up in him (but she does).  I wish they'd had time to show her in therapeutic relation with anybody else--to put in perspective the fact that she was a pro in this business.  That is to say, she exposed herself to the risks of sexual bonding in a clinical fashion over and over again.  I know this is a separate issue beyond what the movie could take on, but even one scene with her with one other client, coming or going, or going to bed with hubby following some other day with a client--or for that matter, having to shift hats and enter into real sexuality with her husband--whom I read as a really nice guy--and appropriately adult and real!), would have helped us see what in Mark undid her so.

But this is a movie not only to see, but to own.  You are, after all, going to want to drink it in multiple times.",1364083200,,2558,4.680803571428571
5413383,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"Acting was outstanding. Funny and Very touching and human. Not sure the priest role was believable but William Macy is great anyway. Helen Hunt's relationship with her husband was a bit of a mystery and why she choose this profession.  Seemed that she had issues of her own that were unresolved. Another movie I suppose. It would be nice to think the ""happy"" ending that results in a lovely companion meets most of our hopes and dreams. Not usually the case so maybe a more realistic ending would have been more honest and powerful. Still worth seeing.",1364083200,,552,4.690721649484536

5413415,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"And I can't believe I'm saying that.  Because ten minutes into this film -- once I realized what it was going to be about -- I was ready to pick up a book.
Tear-jerkers... or touching... or moving... or heart-rending films (or books), aren't, as a rule, my thing.  But -- to the extent that ""The Sessions"" was any of those... well, in the end, I didn't even care.  Or, really, notice.  What I did notice, though, was a thoughtful, brilliantly well-done (and acted) film about... being alive.  And how well some of us do that.
So...  I'm happy in the extreme that I hung in there with it.  Because film-making simply doesn't get better than this.
Sadly, though -- judging from the slim box office receipts -- relatively few people saw it.  Which is a genuine shame.
And another shame is how ignored this film was by The Oscars.  Yes, Helen Hunt (deservedly so) was nominated for her work in ""The Sessions,"" but as far as I noticed, that was it.  No nomination for John Hawkes; no Best Picture nomination; nothing else.  Which, I'd say, just underscores how irrelevant and meaningless The Oscars have become in recent decades.  But that's another subject.
To anyone who hasn't seen ""The Sessions"" yet, trust me on this:  You won't be sorry if you do.  At least you won't be if you're a fan of great film-making.  Or ever spent more than a few seconds reflecting upon the vagaries of life.  So, if you fall into either of those categories,  SEE THIS FILM!  You won't be disappointed.

My graduate degree is in the area of psychology and this movie should be ""required"" viewing for everyone wanting to gain optimal insight into human relationship response mechanisms,human sexuality,our feelings of insecurity and joy that we all share and so much more. Yes...so much attention is given in this movie's trailers to seeing Helen Hunt naked in bed with an extremely physically disabled man,but if you make the effort to see & think ""outside of the box"" while carefully viewing this 1-1/2 hour movie,you will walk away with so much. You will feel/experience the heaviness that the priest,the disabled man's caregivers,his sex surrugate,and so many others experience dealing with their ""own"" exposure to sexual issues and just being human as they witness what the polio stricken man (Mark/a.k.a. John Hawkes) is going through as he tackles his own human obstacles. Hawkes (in his character) demonstrates unbelievable strength,emotion,insight, & humor while living what for most people would be a wretched,scary,& depressing existence. Other reviewers of this movie have been critical of so many different minor character roles being introduced;but all of these supportive roles really do ""ADD(!)"" to the entire movie. Men are not supposed to cry & nor are we supposed to witness another person's joy and happiness (like what Hawkes experiences) & then weep for that character even more,but this movie will keep your ""mind"" glued to the screen--I can assure you. This movie also gives hope to us middle aged people in terms of our sexuality--you see Helen Hunt with some unretouched facial wrinkles and some non-airbrushed body moles,but you also see just how beautiful an older woman can be and you also witness how even this man who has extreme difficulty moving at all can bring out the best in her & make her glow--even when there seems to be a somewhat stale quality between Helen Hunt (the sex surrogate) and her own husband in the movie. Most heterosexual men would buy this movie just to see the beautiful Helen Hunt naked and talking sexy and seductive,but everyone of both sexes will get so much more than that. Yes...it DID win a big award at the Sundance Festival,but let's (you educators,too!) make further ""use"" of this movie.

I loved that they focused on a man whose disability could be very tragic but examined his sexual journey in a very matter of fact, almost cheerful way. There was a lot of humor in the film which never became gimmicky. There were many moving moments, thoughtful moments, profound moments that never became preachy or cheesy or melodramatic. I loved that the protagonist's sexual journey brought him in contact with many women but they never seemed like plot devices. Somehow (the writing again) they were all fully realized, beautiful people in their own right, even when the story didn't focus on them. I laughed, I cried and I absorbed and was humbled by the realities of a life so different from my own. I also found myself relating to his story on so many levels. The cast is fantastic. Helen Hunt had quite a balancing act to do in her role and I thought she accomplished it beautifully (while naked no less). William H. Macy is particularly fun as the supportive and very honest priest. I was also thrilled to so Moon Bloodgood in a quirky role very different from her usual action goddess roles. A bonus if you are a fan of Deadwood: It is fun to see so many cast members playing modern characters so different from the ones they play on the TV show.

The cast did a fantastic job of bringing this true story to life. I applaud the casting director for using actual handicapped actors and actresses to play the roles that they did. You just want to cheer for John Hawkes charactor. Don't miss this one and make sure the tissues are nearby.",1363046400,,429,4.584415584415584

5413447,4,B00AEK9BKQ,An unusual story of a guy crippled by polio and his life struggles.  After you get over seeing Helen Hunt naked you can move on to the story and characters which are great.

The expressions, the moments, the feelings and awareness imparted by the scenes...its just well done.  The characters played their parts well.

I wish the Amanda story had been given more development but I can see that, if it had, the flow of the movie might have changed.

Its a five star adult movie...a movie for adults.",1362873600,,588,4.509433962264151

5413454,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"The Sessions is based on the true story of a sex therapist/surrogate who assists a 40-something year old man paralyzed by polio to claim his own sexuality.  I know, I know, it  sounds creepy and pornographic,  But I was intrigued by the trailer, which actually seemed to be tasteful.  Well into the movie, I was surprised to notice that the sexual content and nudity [of which there is plenty] really became very secondary to the emotionally moving heart of the film. John Hawkes does an Oscar-worthy job as the paralyzed therapy-seeker who  has the courage to look for love. I don't know how many actors could engage the audience with the limitations imposed upon him, but he pulls it off using only his facial expression and dialog.  By the end of the movie, he has become someone all of us would like to know.  Helen Hunt is terrific [and gutsy, at her age] as the therapist.  Ordinarily she portrays characters with a bit of a tough exterior, but she also dug deep for this role, and is convincing as a compassionate therapist, willing to be vulnerable to help a fellow human being realize his greatest wish and full expression of his humanity.  William Macy is his usual quirky and spot-on self as a priest/friend who sees Hawkes through his journey.  In summary, this film earns its R rating and is not for anyone underage.  But for those who are not offended by a bit of nudity and frank language, the reward is a moving and tender love story--love in the sense of human connection and helping one another through the journey of life, what others might call ""agape"".",1362787200,,1573,4.622302158273381

5413459,4,B00AEK9BKQ,The movie made me laugh and cry.  It brought the realization of how someone's world can be changed by human touch and compassion.  Life is what YOU make of it to be either positive or negative.  The movie demonstrated that it is simply mind over matter and what really counts is how YOU contribute to it.,1362787200,,304,4.392857142857143

Live life to its fullest!",1362787200,,334,4.354838709677419

I've worked with many disabled people, and they often don't reach acceptance or sexual or intimacy.  Helen Hunt, did a wonderful job in depicting the sensitivity needed for the role.  Disabled people in general, do have number of choices.  The storyline was excellent.",1362787200,,404,5.153846153846154

5413467,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"This is an interesting concept . I was surprised that is a true story. I was prepared for a comedy or some kind of erotic fantacy.

I sincerely recomend this movie.",1362700800,,342,4.196969696969697

5413475,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I love this movie! As usual, I wanted to make sure I saw all the movies up for Academy Awards. At the last minute (Saturday before the big day) I watched Argo (not so much) and The Sessions. OMG! I watched it once and then watched it again a couple of hours later. Then I watched it again on Sunday. Then again on Monday. I will probably watch it again today now that I am thinking about it while writing this review.

This is a sweet, lovely, funny, poignant, endearing story. It is a real story and is local and current for me. I lived in the Bay Area in the 1980's when Mark O'Brian (played convincingly by John Hawkes) was living in Berkeley and having this wonderful adventure. At the age of 38, this brave poet who lived motionless in an iron lung 20 hours per day with no ability to move any part of his body other than his head ... and, oh yeah, his penis ... decides that he wants to have sex. With the help of a sex therapist / surrogate played exquisitely by Helen Hunt, and his priest played hysterically by William Macy, Mark turns mission impossible into one of the most tender human connection ... and, yes ... even love stories. I laughed and I wept. Every time I watch this precious movie I see something new that cracks me up -- either in laughter or tears -- or both at the same time.
This movie is all about sex, but it is not titillating or kinky or an any way offensive. It is beautiful. Helen Hunt is the perfect Cheryl - lovely in every way. William Macy is the wild card -- what a perfect man to play the sincere yet sort of odd ball priest. I can't imagine what John Hawlkes had to do to be able to play Mark in such a believable way. Moon Bloodgood is magnificent as Vera, Mark's attendant during his poignant journey to ""full-blooded male homo sapianhood"".",1362614400,,1784,4.247058823529412
5413476,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"Seriously, read the above headline. What more is required from an independent film!? Unlike roughly 70-per-cent of the indie films which I venture to watch, this movie is absolutely NOT pretentious. It seems like it has an utterly depressing premise (a man paralyzed from polio since childhood is the protagonist), but the actors, the screenplay, and the direction of the movie come at the story from a better place. There's always stuff to live for, things to laugh about, and moments that are so wonderful that they wash out all of the other bad things in your life. Good stuff.",1362614400,,580,4.81

5413478,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"This was such a touching yet humorous (and true) story about a young man stricken with polio who wanted to have sex before he died. Helen Hunt did a wonderful job as the sex therapist and John Hawks was so funny and candid even in his crippled state. Even tho a person is handicapped or developmentally challenged, they to, have needs and wants and can be capable of having a sexual relationship with another person. This movie should have won more awards than what it did. This is a must see for all adults.",1362614400,,508,4.414893617021277
5413479,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"The Sessions was really overlooked this past year by the awards such as The Oscars and The Golden Globes.  Helen Hunt deservedly received a best supporting actress nomination (although she really was a lead).  John Hawkes gave another academy award performance (although not nominated), and when you start looking at his body of work it is apparent this guy is the real deal.  And then there is the movie/story based on a real person.  Everyone who loves the movies should see this film....it is beautifully filmed, directed and acted.",1362614400,,535,4.977528089887641

5413485,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"I thought that the movie portrayed the sensual side of sex very well. The actors were amazing in their roles.

5413488,5,B00AEK9BKQ,It is hard to be more human than what is portrayed in this movie. It makes you feel optimistic about being alive. Some of the early sex scenes are a bit awkward but the emotion so overwhelms the physical aspects that any uncomfortable feelings quickly evaporate. This movie may not be everyone but if you have a heart you will love it. More depth and way better than Argo - and I felt closer to the characters than in Lincoln - both good movies but this one is special - the only movie that I liked as much in the past year was Monsieur Lazhar,1362441600,,543,4.180952380952381

The story could end there but O'Brien's brilliant mind and joy of living overcame all obstacles. O'Brien is not exactly paralyzed, he explains. It's his muscles that don't work. He can't move his body below his nexk yet he becomes a writer. He has feeling throughout his body but can't touch a person or object. He has a wonderful mind trapped in a body that has abandoned him.

THE SESSIONS delves into one aspect of O'Brien's incredible life and the movie takes us on an incredible journey of life, love and hope. At age 38, O'Brien, with much guilty and anxiety, decides to hire a sex surrogate just to finally experience sex and physical closeness. He later wrote an article about this experience which became the basis of this book.

We can look at Mark O'Brien with pity or revulsion, as many people did, or we can see him as an inspiration and a joyous creation from God. O'Brien lived an exceptionally long life, despite his condition, and touched the hearts of many. His was a true story of overcoming or at least accepting the worst obstacles life could give anyone.

John Hawkes gives tremendous heart and depth to his portrayal of O'Brien. Hawkes went beyond the norm and refused doubles or special effects and turned his own body into the twisted posture of a polio-stricken O'Brien. Helen Hunt was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Cheryl Cohen-Greene, the real-life sex surrogate that changed O'Brien's life for ever. Hunt shows her remarkable acting talents as the surrogate baring not only her heart and soul for the role but her body in very tasteful but somewhat explicit nude and sex scenes. Both Hawkes and Hunt became their roles and the connection between the actors and the real-life characters is clear.

Hawkes endearing speech pattern and smile and humor endears us the O'Brien he portrays. We just want to give Hawkes and O'Brien a loving hug and to relish his delightful humorous take on life and his tragic situation. O'Brien's moral dilema is strengthed by scenes with his parrish priest placed by William H. Macy. Macy's role is important as the Catholic priest helping O'Brien wrestle with his shame and embarassment along with his strong desire to experience sex for the first time. Macy's role could have been much more and somehow the priest seems one-dimensional as he listens to O'Brien's stories about the surrogate. Obviously, there is the connection between the two as far as not having sex, except the priest has made a decision to be celibate. O'Brien is trapped in a body that is not fully functional and any chance of a normal loving relationship with a woman seems impossible.

THE SESSIONS will break your heart and inspire you at the same time. There is a sweet sadness to the story that is peppered with hopelessness yet the story is full of hope and joy. It is a remarkable story that the actors and writers brought to the big screen. This fine independent film will keep you thinking and wondering. The priest says God will give O'Brien a ""pass"" on breaking the rules against pre-martital sex because of O'Brien's predicament. The moral dilemma is heartbreaking since there is no one to blame or judge here.

The writers treat the story with gentle humor. Hawkes's take on O'Brien is so lively and full of joy. There is an inspirational tone to the entire film that leaves the viewer curious about O'Brien's lifem along with a bittersweet sense of hope. It is a truly wonderful film.

The extras on the film are rather limited and involve Helen Hunt and John Hawkes getting into their roles. There is an interview with the real Cheryl Cohen-Greene who talks very briefly about her career as a sexy surrogate. She never mentiones O'Brien and what relationship that had and how their sessions affected her emotionally. The movie leads us to believe they had a spiritual and emotional connection in their few sessions. Cohen-Greene certainly had an immense effect on O'Brien. A brief feature on the real Mark O'Brien would have been an added plus. We're led to believe he found love the last few years of his life, but did he? THE SESSIONS touches the viewer so deeply that we only want more information on Mark O'Brien and his life. The movie opens with scenes of O'Brien ""driving"" his bed around Berkeley but there is no mention if this is actual footage or not. Truly a remarkable film that leaves so many questions unanswered and has the viewer wanting more.",1362009600,2,4601,4.729426433915212

5413511,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"I have to preface this by saying I saw the documentary about Mark before watching this. It was done with him telling his own life's story and it compelled me to watch this film.

This movie is very touching and also disturbing. It's hard to watch how one person has to bear their soul to people who just don't get what it's like to have to depend on others for everything, whether they want to or not.

However, the film gets quite detailed in showing how Mark goes forward trying to overcome the barriers put in place by able-bodied society. He is also portrayed as a man who knows he has been infantalized and has to some extent internalized this, making himself doubt whether he is ready for carnal knowledge.

Although Helen Hunt does well as the sex surrogate, this whole line is a fabrication...it never happened this way, as those who know Mark will attest. She supposedly is very professional in what she does until she works with a man who has disability, so now she magically has inappropriate feelings!?

The most troubling thought I have about this film deals with a problem I find with many films that portray persons living with disability: WHERE are the actors who are living with disability??? Why must we watch a whole parade of actors receive awards for the ""courageous"" way they played the part of a person living with disability????????

Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I am glad the topic of this movie is put out there. There are many people living with disability through no choice of their own are kept from experiencing the act of having sex or making love because the puritans in charge of them would say they have no need for that. (Working with people who have disability for many years, I can vouch for this one.) Time will tell if anything beyond this Hollywood romanticism of disability film will actually happen. For Mark's memory, I hope it does.",1362009600,2,1891,4.599406528189911

His Australian short ""Plead guilty and get a bond"" is a hoot for every second of its short 30 minites and it is a real shame it has yet to be officially released on video. His ""Dunera Boys"" is a masterpiece and one of the greatest treasures in my collection.

5413600,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"*This review contains spoilers, but nothing significant that wasn't shown in the trailer*

Here's a movie that would never have been made 30 or 40 years ago, because of the subject matter. It's based on the true story of how 38-year-old Mark O'Brien (Hawkes) tried to lose his virginity. What complicates matters is that he spends most of his life inside an iron lung, and he can only leave it for two or three hours at a time. He's a polio victim, and while he's able to feel sensation in every part of his body, his muscles aren't strong enough to enable him to stand. In fact, his emaciated body has trouble remaining straight, even with him lying down.

Are you depressed yet? It doesn't sound like a very uplifting story, does it? Actually, it may surprise you.

Although Mark's situation is serious, and is treated as such for the most part, the movie is full of humor. Don't misunderstand me; it's not a comedy, but the story of a man who uses humor to enable him to tolerate his limited existence. If you have ever seen The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, you'll know exactly what I mean. As I enjoyed the humor, I wondered whether that's a common defense mechanism for people with physical handicaps, or a device used by the director to make a grim situation more palatable for the audience.

We see Mark try a series of caregivers, before eventually settling on Vera (Moon Bloodgood). She's friendly and clearly gets on well with Mark, supporting him whenever she can. Mark decides that he wants to experience sex before he dies, but he's a religious man and doesn't feel comfortable pursuing the idea without the blessing of his priest, Father Brendan (Macy). Macy is great in his role, and gives us a way to hear Mark's thoughts, doubts, and ideas. The exchanges between the two provide many of the movie's highlights.

After getting permission to see a sex surrogate, Mark sets up the appointment. This is where things really start to get interesting. He meets Cheryl (Hunt), who is assigned to teach him about sex. There is a lot of nudity from this point on, and the R-rating is justified. If you are squeamish about nudity, or planning on watching it with a young child, it won't be a good choice. The discussions between Cheryl and Mark are frank and to the point, with constant references to sexual practices and terminology. Cheryl says at the outset that she can only meet Mark for a maximum of six sessions, presumably to make it clear that the two aren't entering into a permanent relationship. She's married with a son, and this is her occupation; she's not a prostitute.

Put yourself in Mark's position for a moment. It's a natural human need, so why should he miss out? The movie handles the subject well, keeping things serious when they need to be. If the humor had been misplaced, or too frequent, it would have cheapened the story. But the balance is just about perfect, and I found myself empathizing with Mark and rooting for him.

It's an adult movie that will make you laugh out loud frequently, and perhaps shed a tear. Hawkes is superb in the role and was unlucky not to be nominated. Hunt gained the movie's only nomination, and her performance was faultless. I liked the characters and appreciated everything about the movie. It's one that I'll probably pick up on Blu-ray in the near future.",1360540800,3,3329,4.64176570458404
5413601,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"For kids this film is not (definitely an R-rated story). Still, honestly 3 seconds into the film most adults will probably understand why the story deserved to be told.

Mark O'Brien was a quadraplegic due to polio, needing an iron lung to breathe, since the age of six.  Despite his disability the opening scene shows news-footage of him, smiling, BEING WHEELED-OUT ON A GURNEY, receiving his master's degree in journalism from the University of California-Berkeley.

The rest of the film is about an assignment he gave himself after being asked to write an article about ""the sex habits of the disabled.""  (Again, this film is not for kids).

However, Marc O'Brien's own article ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate"" (Google him and the article) about this adventure is  _definitely_ worth the read and his closing thoughts in that article would honestly impress more than a few Confessors.",1360540800,2,882,5.006849315068493

5413627,5,B00AEK9BKQ,"THE SESSIONS is clearly one of the finest films of the year, if not the young decade. It is a true story based on the life of Mark O'Brien (July 31, 1949 - July 4, 1999), a journalist, poet and advocate for the disabled. Before this film he was the subject of `Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien', which won an Academy Award in 1997. The SESSIONS is based on his essay, ""On Seeing a Sex Surrogate"", which appeared in the Sun magazine in 1990.

Without ever dipping into self pity Mark O'Brien is played by John Hawkes (in one of the finest performers by an actor is a long time) as a bright, high spirited young man confined to an iron lung at night and completely paralyzed, meaning that his writing and his telephone dialing must be accomplished with the use of a mouth-held wand. Despite his rather hopeless condition Mark concentrates on positive things: he is a 38 year old frustrated virgin who seeks advice from his priest (William H. Macy is a multifaceted, sensitive role) as well as a therapist (Blake Lindsley) who recommend Mark engage a professional sex surrogate/typical soccer mom with a house, a mortgage and a philosopher husband (Adam Arkin) named Cheryl Cohen-Greene (Helen Hunt in an underplayed, beautifully acted role). With the assistance of his changing caregivers - Amanda (Annika Marks), and Vera (Moon Bloodgood) - and his new friend, the disabled Arthrogryposis victim Carmen (Jennifer Kumiyama) and his priest's encouragement and sanction, he begins therapy with Cheryl. Though the therapy is restricted to six sessions, during these delicately and often warmly humorous sessions Mark discovers his body and is able to achieve penetration.  The therapy is a success but in the process Cheryl discovers a soft spot in her heart for Mark and knows when to call the boundaries. But Cheryl has introduced Mark to the pleasures of love and the ever-open Mark learns that there are three women who truly love him - Cheryl, Amanda, and a new acquaintance Susan (Robin Weigert). Mark has succeeded on an extraordinary personal journey to discover the wondrous pleasures that make life worth living.

The ensemble cast is flawless, with excellent cameos by Rhea Perlman, Rusty Schwimmer, Ming Lo among others.  The delicately beautiful musical score is by Marco Beltrami.  Much of the success of this extraordinary film is due to the sensitive writing and directing by Ben Lewin. It is a must-own film. Grady Harp, February 13",1360195200,4,2464,4.913461538461538

5413632,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"""There was no escaping it a door had opened that I could not close, and in invisible writing it said do not enter."" Mark O'Brien (Hawkes) is a writer living in an iron lung. After an idea for the sexual habits of the disabled approaches him his life is changed. He now wants to experience it for himself, before time runs out. Judging by the description I think I know what your thinking, but this is not over the top sexual. While it is the main idea of the movie the acting job by Hawkes is the driving force. The way he portrays a man full of fear and uncertainty about what is going really gives depth and heart to a character who otherwise would come off as creepy. There is some humor in this and it really helps move the film along. This is not a movie for everyone but it is an interesting experience and I liked it. There is a lot of nudity and sex in this movie but it is more technical and doesn't border on soft-core so if that is what is holding you back don't worry. This is a movie worth seeing for the acting and the way you really start to feel for Mark, Cheryl (Hunt) and their experience. It's hard to explain how this makes you feel, it's something you need to see for yourself. Overall, different and better then I was expecting. Not for everyone but I think its worth watching.

5413649,4,B00AEK9BKQ,"The remarkably nuanced performance of John Hawkes provides the beating heart of this small 2012 independent film based on the life of poet and journalist Mark O'Brien who contracted polio at age six and spent the rest of his life in an iron lung unable to control his muscles. A chameleonic actor whose familiarity to me comes from memorably villainous turns in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter-s-Bone/dp/B003EYVXTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter's Bone</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martha-Marcy-May-Marlene/dp/B006Z7XNVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martha Marcy May Marlene</a>, Hawkes brings unexpected pathos and humor as well as a painfully realistic physicality to a role that could have easily fallen prey to the more stereotypical, life-affirming treatment you would likely find in a disease-of-the-week TV-movie. It doesn't completely escape the predictable dimensions of the genre, but the film's overriding honest sensibility and lack of cheap sentiment probably have a lot to do with the director and screenwriter Ben Lewin whose own childhood bout with polio has left him to a lifetime on crutches.

Based on the subject's own writing, the story picks up Mark's life in Berkeley as he is taken care of by a series of caretakers, one a comely student named Amanda with whom he falls in love. Despite an obvious fondness for him, she cannot reciprocate his feelings for her, which leads him to seek counsel with his minister, Father Brendan. Their comic interactions eventually lead Mark at age 38 to search for the services of a sex surrogate. Enter Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a content wife and mother who matter-of-factly tells Mark that she will be his sexual guide for six sessions in which she plans to heighten his body awareness, lead him toward intercourse, and prepare him for a sexually fulfilling life. Perhaps not coincidentally, one of Helen Hunt's best early roles was as the married woman learning to cope with her lover's paraplegic state in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Waterdance/dp/B008SGVSMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Waterdance</a>. Here the actress returns twenty years later to a similar role as Cheryl, and she turns in a terrifically brave and assured performance. Her nudity is presented in such a nonchalant manner that there isn't a hint of exploitation about it.

It should come as no surprise that the physical and emotional intertwining of their relationship gets complicated but not in a way that is entirely predictable. It's clear that Cheryl is dealing with conflicts of her own, including a conversion to Judaism, that have put her in a more vulnerable state than she may have realized. In fact, none of the characters' feelings are telegraphed in a standard by-the-numbers way, and it is a testament to Lewin's filmmaking skill that he trusts his actors so fully to inhabit the roles. While Father Brendan may come across as an overgrown Berkeley hippie stereotype at times, William H. Macy is funny and endearing in his few scenes. Other smaller turns are solid - Moon Bloodgood as poker-faced attendant Vera, Annika Marks as open-hearted Amanda, and in near-cameos, Adam Arkin as Cheryl's sullen stay-at-home husband and Rhea Perlman as the cheery (pardon the pun) Mikvah lady. While there are formulaic moments that don't quite transcend the story's more inspirational aspects, the film is well worth seeking out.",1359936000,4,3523,5.760076775431862

Often times you'll view a movie that you know is made well but doesn't move you, leaves you curbside, and are well aware that you've just witnessed an expertly crafted piece of work but aren't vested in its characters. Not so with this film which from start to finish entetertains, educates, and illuminates and does so artfully.  Oh yes,I haven't told you what the film is about but all you have to do is look at the pictoral and read the first paragraph of any review to get that - iron lung, sex surrogate, therapy.

  How do you make a dramatic movie about a guy who's in an iron lung most of the day? Well, they manage to pull it off in the true life story, 'The Sessions'. John Hawkes, known for a couple of psycho roles in 'Winter Bones' and 'Martha Macy May Marlene', magnificently transforms himself into the severely handicapped Mark O'Brien, disabled since childhood with polio and forced to live in an iron lung, except for about four hours per day. O'Brien is not technically paralyzed but his muscles are useless, and he can only move his lips and neck. He gets out of the house on a gurney, pushed by attendants working on day and night shifts.

  'The Sessions' manages not to be maudlin or heavy handed due to the remarkable personality of O'Brien. In spite of the crushing limitations of his life, O'Brien manages to be relatively optimistic. He writes poetry and communicates with others, not expressing self-pity, but with a wry sense of humor. His confidante is Father Brendan, a liberal priest, winningly played by William H. Macy. When O'Brien informs Father Brendan that he seeks to lose his virginity by employing a sex surrogate, the good Father notes that having sex outside of marriage is a sin. But given O'Brien's situation, Father Brendan wisely adds that in this case, he believes that God can make an ""exception"".

  The bulk of 'The Sessions' revolves around O'Brien's session with sex surrogate, Cheryl Cohen-Greene (professionally played by Helen Hunt). At first, O'Brien is deathly afraid of the encounters with Cohen-Greene, but she soon gets him to relax and he's able to have intercourse with her. Initially, they agree on eight sessions but cut things off after six, as Cohen-Greene finds that O'Brien is falling in love with her and her emotions are getting in the way too.

  There are other characters that drift in and out of O'Brien's life, including Amanda, a volunteer with the disabled, who befriends O'Brien, but eventually has to move away, due to guilt feelings about not wanting to have an intimate relationship with him. One of O'Brien's attendants, Vera, also adds a great deal of texture to O'Brien's moving journey. Eventually, a woman, Susan, becomes O'Brien's partner for the rest of the five years of his life and provides him with meaningful companionship.

  One scene that doesn't completely ring true is Cohen-Greene's husband, Josh, becoming jealous over a letter O'Brien sends her. On the plus side, the film is also not without a moment of high drama when there's a power failure and O'Brien is trapped in a non-functioning iron lung without anyone there to help him.

  The Session's director, Ben Lewin, a polio survivor himself, lends his expertise on the subject to the production. One critic felt that the film needed to be truer to the real-life O'Brien's writings.

  Nonetheless, due to its fine performances, 'The Sessions' appears to rise above standard TV movie fare. It's a touching story about a man whose spirit soared, despite crippling physical limitations.",1359158400,6,3062,4.953033268101761
