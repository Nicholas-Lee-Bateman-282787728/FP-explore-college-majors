7990090,2,B000098ZRQ,Dumb plot. Dumb acting.  Reminded me of an amateur high school production.  I bought it because  I wanted to see  more  of Wallace  Ford`s  early work  His acting was okay given what he had to work with.,1520035200,,203,4.297297297297297
7990091,4,B000098ZRQ,"Another fun B&W mystery from the 1930's (1936 in this case) with an Inn full of suspicious characters and victims mounting up, apparently from a dog attack.  The audio and visual are just fine although the age of the film does show in parts.  I think other fans of this genre of film will be pleased to add this to their collection.",1487116800,,332,4.338709677419355
7990092,3,B000098ZRQ,"Alpha Videos produce PUBLIC DOMAIN films for about $5.
Often, these videos are a little rough because they're usually
from 16mm film stock.
An occasional jump-splice or substandard audio is the price
you pay for the PRICE you pay.
This IS available for two and three times the price of THIS one.
It served its purpose on a rainy day... certainly no worse than
a modern-day movie of the week on The SyFy Channel... It's
not that much, and it MIGHT just surprise you.",1439683200,,465,4.5476190476190474
7990093,4,B000098ZRQ,"A couple desperate to get married, decide to go somewhere where it can be done quickly.  They end up at The Rogues Tavern and send for the justice of the peace to perform a speedy service.  The owners of said establishment aren't happy to include them amongst their few guests.  (Methinks something's afoot!)  It doesn't help that he's a detective (Wallace Ford as Jimmy Kelly) and his fiance (Barbara Pepper as Marjorie Burns) used to work as a department store ""detective.""  One of the guests is attacked by an ""animal"" and hastily dies on the floor.  With no vehicle on hand, no one is leaving this hell hole out in the middle of nowhere.  A poor dog is blamed for the crime.  A second victim is killed in the same manner.  Everyone starts to get worried, especially considering the two dead and the three surviving guests were all invited there under false pretenses.  ""We're doomed!""  The phone line is cut.  The lights go out!!!  Will they survive the night?

Not bad, for its type.  The transfer is lousy but with a movie of this age, not unexpected.  Barbara Pepper has the best of the bad dialog.  Wallace Ford is a bit insufferable; his character constantly dismisses his fiance, who appears much better at sleuthing than he is.  Why she puts up with him is a bigger mystery.",1431216000,,1285,4.58590308370044
7990094,4,B000098ZRQ,"Alpha's edition of ""Rogues Tavern"" is very acceptable viewing, although the print used shows its wear.  There is one bad dialogue splice at the beginning, but the rest is basically splice-free.  I've seen that same scene without the splice in a re-issue copy.  It seems that you have to make your own copy to get it right.  Otherwise, the original titles are present and there is no Alpha logo.",1373328000,2,394,4.666666666666667
7990095,3,B000098ZRQ,"ROGUE'S TAVERN is an Old Dark House-type murder mystery set in an inn. Wallace Ford (One Frightened Night) plays a department store detective who just happens to be at the Red Rock Inn w/ his fiancee (Barbara Pepper) when the murders begin. At first, we're led to believe that a mad dog is the culprit, but we soon find out that all of the guests have been summoned to this place in order to be done in! Ford isn't bad as a fairly reserved, level-headed guy, unlike his usual goofball roles. Pepper is pretty good in her sleuthing role as well. RT would make a nice addition to your next ""who-done-it?"" marathon...",1152576000,9,614,4.491071428571429
