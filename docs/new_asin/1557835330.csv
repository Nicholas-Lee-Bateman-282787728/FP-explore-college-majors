7795925,1,1557835330,"When you hear ""Royal Shakespeare Company"", you think ""high quality"" and ""great playwriting""; ""the best actors a director could hope to audition"". You don't think ""a poor amalgam of international artists"", ""ill-fitting costumes/masks"" and a bad outcome all around.

I bought this DVD because I'm a newly minted fan of Greg Hicks. I haven't had a chance to see any RSC productions, just clips and teasers posted to YouTube. But the difference is scathingly clear. It isn't so much that I'm ""comparing apples to oranges"" (who can compare a ""mere mortal"" to Shakespeare?), it's that the regular RSC productions are clean and run smoothly, with excellent costumes and scenery. In ""Tantalus"", the masks are creepy, the makeup beneath poor and the clips shown throughout the 2:22 slog aren't so much as a seven-month masterpiece as twenty years of ""What the heck were you thinking?!""* (Oh, and did I mention that the ""war dance"" looked like a little boy jumping on a trampoline with some Power-Ranger-villain-concepts cavorting behind him? No?)

I can't believe that, after paying ridiculous ticket prices and sitting in a theatre for 12.5 hours, the critics give this rave reviews. Makes me wonder what they put into the food during their meal breaks.

7795926,5,1557835330,"The subject of this documentary is the evolution of an amazing 10-hour play, premiered in Denver in 2000. A Google search on the internet will provide contemporary review: audiences raved despite the incredible ticket price, the 10 am to 10:30 pm running time, with two meal breaks. The story is based on an amalgam of Greek myth, centered around yet another human tortured by the Gods, this time, with thirst. The play uses every imaginable resource available to modern theater: masks, giant puppets, contemporary characters, gods and goddesses, a stage covered in sand with a pool in it and assembles an international array of theater technicians, each to provide their unique take on costumes, lighting, puppetry, music, set design etc. Knowing that it was spectacularly successful doesn't prevent the viewer of this documentary from sharing the tension, raw panic, primal fear etc. shared by all the professionals that this might just not work--or it will work in an unimaginable way. I saw it when it appeared on PBS in Dec 2001 and rewatched my tape many times before I wore it out. it's great to have it available on DVD.",1248480000,2,1128,4.942105263157894
