4754106,4,B005LAII0I,"""Mirror Mirror"" got lackluster reviews, but it's a charming, funny film with a witty script and jaw-dropping visuals. Above all, it is sweet, something that is lacking in most modern revisionist fairy tales. I laughed a lot. This may be Julia Robert's best film in years. She certainly seems to be having fun! The entire cast is likable. The dialogue is contemporary, but not obnoxiously so. Wisely, the filmmakers didn't adhere to a faithful retelling -- that's been done -- but did a lovely riff on the legend. It even has a beautiful background score by Alan Menken. It amazes me that anyone can dump on a well-crafted, unpretentious film such as this while praising far less worthy efforts. I'm looking forward to ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" because it's going to be a darker, ""Lord of the Rings"" type of fantasy, but I seriously doubt that Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth will match Lily Collins and Armie Hammer's appeal. Watch this. You won't be disappointed!",1334448000,3,972,4.86144578313253
4754107,3,B005LAII0I,"A re-telling of the classic Disney tale of Snow White receives a modern-day make over. The cast of characters is still largely the same, but this time Snow White is a little more independent and able to fend for herself against the evil god-mother. A valiant attempt at updating this tale works well at times, not so well at others. The film certainly looks terrific, with costumes and colorful sets that really bring a magical feel to the film. The humor in it sometimes falls flat as the attempt to be hip does not always work. The best movie's best asset is Lily Collins, who is absolutely delightful as Snow White. I would say that this is a movie that the kids will certainly enjoy and the adults who take them will find it entertaining enough.",1334016000,33,749,4.514705882352941
4754108,4,B005LAII0I,"""Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away...."" How many times will they remake ""Snow White"" and when will we tire of seeing it? At least this time it's billed as ""The untold adventures..."" and is from the queen's point of view.

In this version, our evil queen is played by a wry, dry Julia Roberts, who is clearly having the time of her life, so let's get ready for a new wrinkle on an old story. Her acerbic digressions are a hoot as this is a far more adult (and more comic) take.

This cast promises more than a light touch of comedy:
  * Julia Roberts (""Larry Crowne"") is a four-times-married widow who instantly sees potential in the handsome prince who comes adventuring into her poverty-stricken realm. In order to throw a party for him, she raises taxes.
  * Lily Collins (""Priest"") is our orphaned Snow White, slated for an early death in the forest as soon as the queen realizes the threat from her burgeoning beauty. Collins has the eyebrows of a young Elizabeth Taylor.
  * Armie Hammer (""J. Edgar"") is very funny as the dauntless prince. He is earnest, sincere and quite handsome. He keeps losing all but his skivvies to the dwarfs and has to beg for pants. Wait until you see his tooth sparkle just before he is given the love potion.
  * Nathan Lane (""Modern Family"") is the queen's minion. He is the unwilling bearer of all the bad tidings, e.g., when taxes are raised, and when Snow White is found to be alive after all.
  * Sean Bean (""Game of Thrones"") as the king, long thought dead.
  * Mare Winningham (LOTS of TV) as the scullery maid who is loyal to Snow White and her long-absent father.

Snow White doesn't have good or bad things just happen to her. She has to toil, study, practice and fight, for what she values. I liked seeing her apply herself with a goal in mind; so even though small children were a bit bored, the lessons for their older siblings were good ones. The adult one-liners that made all of us laugh went over the tots' heads, but the lengthy CGI-loaded fight scenes (with G-rated monsters) were tedious for ALL of us. I can fast-forward through those when I get my DVD from Amazon.com.",1333843200,59,2135,4.438461538461539
4754109,5,B005LAII0I,"It's a fun ride.

With over 35 films to her credit, Julia Roberts gives one of her best performances. This might come as a surprise. America's Sweetheart as the Evil Queen. But the actress goes for broke and has a great time doing it. She doesn't play the Queen we grew up with from the fairytale. She goes further and because of that, it's a lot more fun and interesting. Armie Hammer and Nathan Lane are terrific and Lilly Collins manages to look pretty, but lacks a screen charisma that is needed. Luckily, this is Roberts' show and she is everything the movie needs to be.

The visuals are terrific and the costumes are some of the best designs that I've seen in a film in years.",1333670400,15,683,4.3700787401574805
4754110,4,B005LAII0I,"I wasn't sure whether to see this movie or not, but I finally gave in just for curiousity's sake and I was actually suprised that I liked it.",1333411200,2,141,4.071428571428571
4754111,3,B005LAII0I,"""Mirror Mirror"" is ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" in an alternate universe. The creators have taken many liberties with the story that we all grew up with and are familiar with. Snow White (Lily Collins) lives in the castle with the Queen (Julia Roberts) because her father, the King, has disappeared in the woods and has been gone for years. There is a mirror and there is an apple and there are seven dwarfs, but the story isn't the same and most notably, the Dwarfs aren't named Dopey, Doc, Sleepy etc. etc. They are given new names like Napoleon, Half Pint, Grub, Butcher, Chuckles, Grimm and Wolf.

""Mirror Mirror"" is a light-hearted movie that can be enjoyed by all members of the family and that is the best part about it. While Julia Roberts' Evil Queen is certainly evil, vain, self-centered and short sighted, she does so with wit and charm that is more like a pampered New York Socialite than the devilish queen we're familiar with. Snow White is the subject of that thing that happens once or twice a year where dueling movie studios both had the same idea and see who's film does better. For a more twisted and devilish taste of Snow White, you'll have to wait for ""Snow White and the Huntsmen"" slated for June with Twilight's Kristen Stewart.

This version is creative and refreshing but unfortunately hampered with comedy that doesn't really make you laugh all that much, although the dwarves did make me laugh a few times. The story is creative but really doesn't have a whole lot of meat to it or make you feel like there is anything vital at stake. The Queen's stranglehold on the community around her isn't felt enough. Snow White's relationship with the dwarves grows too quickly and we never get a chance to feel it.

Ultimately, despite all the big name stars in the film, the production seemed sort of cheap and the script lacked flair. The movie is mostly a combination of ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Ella Enchanted"" but doesn't capture either one of those films magic. It tries to and it definitely has its moments, but ""Mirror Mirror"" sort of falls flat. The only magic is that they managed to cast the perfect people, but still weren't able to gel the story into something that made you feel anything about what was happening on screen.",1333324800,,2264,4.626865671641791
4754112,5,B005LAII0I,"The film at times, satirizes the fairy tale. Julia Roberts as the wicked Queen step-mom narrates in the beginning. Lilly Collins as Snow White was made to look like Jennifer Connolly in ""Labyrinth."" The humor is simple and basic enough for everyone to enjoy. There are some minor hidden political commentary for us adults. Such as when Julia instructs Brighton (Nathan Lane) to use his imagination and tell the people ""bread is meat"" (ketchup is a vegetable).  But the film doesn't get bogged down trying to be political, it is just a fun film about aging women desperately attempting to hold on to their youth while competing with their daughter for suitors. (I didn't mention Kardashian.)

The background is CG which gives the film a fairy tale look. The dwarfs are quirky and more akin to the ones we knew in ""Time Bandits"" than the bumbling group Disney gave us. They made good use of the sound track, one that could have been used in any film from 1935 to 1970...until the end when they did some ridiculous lip-sync song, directed at the young princesses in the audience. You could tell Julia Roberts had fun making this production.

The film is basically kid safe, some violence and ""horror"". Enjoyable for an adult. This is the film you volunteer to take the kids to go see.",1333152000,10,1281,4.684444444444445
4754113,4,B005LAII0I,"On Wednesday night (3/28), my son and I attended an advance screening of Mirror Mirror, the movie that gives a new take on the story of Snow White.

I was really looking forward to seeing Mirror Mirror.  I had seen the ads for the movie and it looked like it was going to be very funny.  I had also run a giveaway on my blog for the Soundtrack to Mirror Mirror so I knew that the music was going to be great.  And I loved the over-the-top clothing in the movie so much that I even did a Mirror Mirror Pinterest board. So I was expecting to have great time and overall my son and I liked the movie.

Mirror Mirror is told from the perspective of the Evil Queen (played by Julia Roberts).  When the movie opens, the Evil Queen is fully in power and has drained the poor villagers dry of all their money to support her lavish lifestyle of over the top gowns and parties. Her parties are so crazy that she even plays a game of chess with human chess pieces.

Snow White (played by Lilly Collins) has pretty much been locked in her room for the past ten years after her father, the King, disappeared in the forest. The Evil Queen has been controlling poor Snow White by putting her down every chance she can get - and boy oh boy does the Evil Queen do a great job of bullying Snow White. Some of her comments to Snow White are brutal.

On Snow White's 18th birthday, she finally gets the courage to leave the castle and visit the village and she finds that all the once happy people are now dirt poor. But she lacks the confidence to do anything about it. By chance she rescues Prince Alcott, the handsome prince who is passing through the land and has been robbed by the Seven Dwarfs. Yes, you read that correctly. In this version of the Snow White story, the Seven Dwarfs are thieves who live in the forest. At one time, they worked respectable jobs in the village, but the Evil Queen had them banished because of their appearance.

The Queen wants to marry Prince Alcott for his money.  But, Prince Alcott is completely taken with Snow White. So taken in fact that the Queen wants her dead.  The story unfolds from there as Snow White finally ends up getting the courage to fight back.

Julie Roberts is the star of this movie and she is fabulous as the Evil Queen.  She has the best clothes and the best one liners that you will ever hear. There is a scene where she has a ""beauty treatment"" that is totally beyond words. And she is so evil that you will have to look twice to remember that this role is being played by the actress who is the sweetheart of Hollywood.  The way Julia played the Evil Queen reminded me a lot of how Meryl Streep played Miranda Priestly in the movie The Devil Wears Prada. Adults will love the Evil Queen and kids will be scared to death.  My son actually flinched in his seat a few times.

Another great role in Mirror Mirror is Nathan Lane as Brighton, the Evil Queen's butler.  He was just a riot and he had some of the funniest one liners in the whole movie.

Lilly Collins as Snow White was all goodness and sweetest and kids will love her. But she and Prince Alcott (played by Armie Hammer) were upstaged for most of the movie by Julia Roberts as the Evil Queen. I loved their characters at the beginning and the end, but I think they were overpowered by all the fancy clothing (or in Prince Alcott's case - lack of clothing) for most of the movie.  Arnie Hammer had to take off his shirt so many times that I was wondering if this was a kids movie.  And Lilly Collins looked great, but she really needed a few more sword fighting lessons.

The Seven Dwarfs were great and a few of them were so funny that everyone in the audience was laughing out aloud.

The end of Mirror Mirror is wonderful and exciting. Good vs Evil is always thrilling and this movie has some great fight scenes. My son was so into the physical comedy and sword fights that I could hardly keep him in his seat. But despite all the clothing, and sword fighting and evilness, the middle of this movie is a tad boring - hate to say it.

Overall Mirror Mirror is a visually appealing movie that both kids and parents will enjoy.  It was fun and outrageous. It was sweet and cute. And it was evil and exciting. It was also a little bit boring, But the end is definitely worth the entire movie. And mark my words, you will be singing the movie soundtrack song ""I Believe in Love"" on your way to your car.

Mirror Mirror opened in theaters Friday March 30th and is rated PG.",1333152000,4,4474,4.260047281323877
4754114,5,B005LAII0I,"I was lucky enough to see this movie on opening day, and I'm so glad I did! In brief, it's a modern ""twist"" on the classic Snow White story. (The main twist being that Snow White ends up saving the prince.) But there are plenty more... you will not get bored! :) One aspect I loved about this movie was that there is a ""price for using magic,"" which the Queen keeps ignoring. Most movies that involve magic don't bother with the subject. Everything has a consequence, and magic is no exception. The dwarves are not what you'd expect, either. This is a refreshing twist. While their names still tell about their individual characters, they're almost nothing like the cartoon dwarves. An emotional aspect is brought into play during the story as well, where we learn why they act the way they do. (I don't want to give too much away, so just go see the movie!)

Overall, the movie was super funny, yet it still had serious themes interwoven throughout (such as Snow White's and the dwarves' backstories). There is a definite darkness always lurking in the background, but the humor does a wonderful job of lightening it to the point where you just ""go along with it."" We all know how the story goes anyway, right? (Well, a few things are turned around, but the basic gist is the same.) I know any parents and grandparents out there are wondering whether it's kid friendly. I would say yes, but maybe not for the really small kids. There aren't any bad words, no violence, and anything bad that happens-- for the most part-- is accompanied by laugh-out-loud antics. The reason I say not really little kids is only because they might not be able to follow the story very well; the movie gave a feel of being directed toward a more mature audience, even though it was clean enough to be a family movie. There's enough humor that the entire family should come out of it having some favorite scene which made them laugh aloud. (Mine involves some life-size puppets...) :) I end my review with an enthusiastic recommendation: if you've been tossing the idea around in your head whether or not to see this movie, GO SEE IT!!! It will be well worth your time!",1333065600,8,2149,4.552971576227391

The jokes were flat for the most part, and the dialogue went back and forth from funny (almost) to serious. The only clever dialogue went to the Queen, but even then, she could only stretch the humor just so far before none was left. Two teens could have written this script.

Nathan Lane steals every scene he's in. Two issues: Lilly James wore adorable to gorgeous costumes through out, until the big finale where is appeared in some orange and blue hybrid get up that looked like the worst blend of everything from the 80s.

4755560,5,B005LAII0I,"So many people seem to think of this as a literal Snow White fairy tale interpretation.

It's not.

This film is a satire.  The film makes a satirical stab at the tried-and-true fairy tale tropes and has lot of fun doing it.  It's all there:  the beautiful princess, and evil queen, a prince in search of true love, magical allies and terrifying obstacles.

The valiant prince is turned into the damsel in distress, the evil queen has both wit and malice, the princess is clever and full of pluck, and the industrious dwarves are now bandits.

Lily Collins plays a plucky princess with a kind heart while Armie Hammer pokes fun at the roles of the stoic and brave prince one sees in fairy tales played straight. This is not a candified and sanitized fairy tale (many REAL fairy tales are actually quite gruesome) but a spoof of fairy tales in general.

The whole of this film is the eye candy of the costumes, the last creations of the late Eiko Ishioka, and the fun sight gags with the twists and turns fo the characters.  It's not high cinema, so relax and just have fun watching.",1451692800,6,1082,4.479591836734694

A 2012 film Directed by Tarsem Singh.
Staring: Julia Roberts, Lilly Collins, Armie Hammer, Nathan Lane, Martin Klebba, and Danny Woodburn.

A 7/10 rating for me. My 5 year old niece really likes it. Says its up at the top of her favorites. Like a Frozen Favorite.

(The Short Short Synopsis: a Snow White fairytale retelling. An evil Queen rules over a kingdom after the king disappears. With the help of 7 dwarves, a prince, and others, Princess Snow White takes back her birthright.)

My thoughts

I have lost count on how many times Ive seen this movie. I rented the movie when it first came out. I liked it and even watched it again. Then I returned it and hardly ever saw that movie.

When my niece was 4, princesses and fairytales was a big thing and still is. Frozen and Brave was a huge hit with her (I liked Brave more). All these new and old princess movies had my niece curious about the Snow White movie. My sisters and I have seen it, but Disney has taken a lot of their movies off the shelf for re-marketing. So if I want my nieces and nephew to see the movies, then I just hope itll be aired on tv so I can record it.

And then last year ABC Family channel aired Mirror Mirror a few times. Its not the same as Disneys Snow White, but I recorded it thinking my niece would like it. She loved it! Was even cheering along and telling Snow not to eat the apple. That recording stayed on our dvr for a month, and was constantly played. So I had finally given in and bought the dvd. I needed the space on the dvr after all.

That was all about a year ago. The dvd has been played a few times since but recently not a lot. My niece even forgot a little about the movie. And I think thats why she picked it out Tuesday night during that rain and thunder. It turned out to be perfect for snuggle up and watch a movie time.

I am a fan of fairytales that are retold. Especially when it shows that the princess is not helpless. Mirror Mirror changes a lot of the Snow White story. Like the 7 dwarves actually have names. Well, most of them did. People did call the princess Snow White, but a lot of the times she was just Snow. My niece got confused with that because she said her name is Snow White. Not Snow.

What I like about this movie, and has me willing to watching it again with my niece, is the comedy. There is a some adult humor in this, and a lot that humor my niece doesnt understand. My niece thinks the movie is funny sometimes too. And we both enjoy the entire movie. Well, that is, my niece is at that age where she doesnt like bad guys and villains so much. She wouldnt even rewatch the Cinderella movie with me because she says the Step-Mother is too scary. And she saw that in the theaters, so she knows what happens. So as for the Queen in Mirror Mirror, Julia Roberts played it just right. She was a villain but not a scary one.",1446595200,,2869,4.162454873646209

4756898,4,B005LAII0I,"Mirror, Mirror (2012) was an interesting outtake on the classic fairytale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Yet it was more alike to the original tale than I expected with a few interesting quirks of its own, *smiles*. We have the wicked queen. An ominous forest. The sweet, beautiful Snow White. Seven, funny dwarves. A bright red apple.

  *Sigh* I just love fairytales!! And this live-action retelling of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves did not disappoint. Lovely. Humorous. Romantic. Intriguing. I was surprised at how much I liked it!

  It was definitely a more lighthearted tale. We quickly realize the stepmother/queen is quite horrible, yet we don't get that sinister chill from her person. Humor is splashed into the most unlikely places. A dark story is told in a way pert near okay for children to watch. I mean, we still have the queens man bringing back evidence of Snow Whites death and such ghastly scenes; but they're done in a way thats like, Okay, yep, we know whats going on, but yet, you don't feel the full darkness of the situation. Im not sure exactly if thats a good thing or bad, but it sure makes it nicer to watch the fairytales that formerly had a very grim air.

  I love, LOVED the Snow White character. Lily Collins did a perfectly lovely job of bringing this princess to life. She was sweet, innocent, gentle, and kind. The beauty of her heart complimented her natural outward beauty and she was just altogether stunning! I love the way she dipped her chin, smiled shyly. But also she was strong-hearted and courageous. She had a firm desire to help the oppressed and poor. Great portrayal. Once again, I just adore when the fairytale princesses are such sweet, innocent persons, yet with that noticeable inner strength. Feminine yet determined. This is not about besting the men, its just about doing your part as a lady in the story of life.

  The queen was bad, yet not too chilling. The townspeople and servants of the castle were sweet. I liked the prince too, *grins*, except for his humiliating incident that I will expound on below. Aw, the dwarves. They were pretty fun. And some of them quite cute, *smiles*. They were like little men, so pleased when Snow White cooked for them. Training her to fight like shes their little sister. Protecting her. Loving her. Its kinda sweet, *sigh*. Hmm they perhaps might have been a little crude time and again. I cant remember everything.

  The twists on this fairytale were so much fun. Snow White training with the dwarves to become a warrior woman was entertaining and thrilling. She's going to fight back against the wicked queen! Take back the throne which is rightfully hers, and rule the kingdom with justice and kindness! The fighting scene with the prince was entertaining as well, *smiles*.

  The outfits were fun! Just that fairytale-ish feel! And I loved the added swords!

  As for romance, it was pretty classic and cute. Besides the puppy-love part (read more below). There were two or three kisses.

  Ooh, the beast of the forest was really a surprising and grand part of the story! I especially like the scene where all comes to light on that. The ending of the movie is great too! *smiles*

  I did adore Mirror, Mirror (2012) for the most part, but there certainly were some things that I didn't care for at all! (As always, it seems). For one, a certain few scenes of a man being reduced to a pathetic, puppy-like creature by a puppy-love potion. In one scene, he licks a womans face and the like. In the movie, its meant to be an innocent, though silly, scenebut to me it came across as rather disturbing as he is, after all, a grown man. Besides looking inappropriate, it was just plain not fun. Like, where has the strong, handsome prince gone? Hes turned into a ridiculous, weeping puppy, longing for its master, the queen. Though I admit, I couldn't help but laugh when he sat there bawling piteously as the dwarves and Snow White looked on with raised eyebrows. It was a relief when the spell was broken and he came back to his senses for sure though!

  There were a few scenes containing crude humor.

  Quite a few scenes were some people are stripped to their underthings(which are actually quite modest, considering).

  A scene where the queen gets a makeover. Its quite disgusting. I tried not to gag as it involved grubs and snakes and the like. Not sure what it had to do with beauty. Anyway, some of the queens midriff is exposed in that scene.

  The magic did get a little iffy at points. The queen walks into a mirror which brings her through water to these black huts. She goes in there and talks to her reflection(?). I don't know. It could feel a bit eerie. The worst creepy, magic-y part of Mirror, Mirror (2012) is when the reflection lady is playing with two puppets. The scene goes back and forth from that to the dwarves home where two giant puppets are destroying their house and chasing them. Something to do with magic. But that scene for sure had a creepy-ish feel, and I could have certainly done without it!! Not sure what was going on there.

  I would probably recommend teens and up as for audience. Since there is that eerie scene and the inappropriate-looking one, and plus just a few other little negative things. Perhaps some younger kids would be fine with it; but parents guidance at least!

  So overall, this story was so fun and sweet, and just thrilled my fairytale-loving heart! *Grin* It stayed pretty close to the classic fairytale and yet brought some new excitement and intrigue. I would have loved it, if not for the negatives mentioned above. So caution on that part. But otherwise, spectacular!

4757117,3,B005LAII0I,"Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, there was a director named Tarsem Singh. Tarsem had magical abilities to create spellbindingly lovely sets and costumes, in a way that few other directors could. But Tarsem was constantly plagued by an evil force: mediocre scripts that didn't do justice to his spellbinding visuals and direction.

Yes, ""Mirror Mirror"" is yet another movie in the series that I like to call ""Movies That Let Tarsem Singh Down Because He Didn't Write Them."" This comedic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" is not actually a bad movie, mostly due to Tarsem's focus on the dwarves and the prince -- but the excessive wackiness and the wooden acting of Lily Collins don't do the story justice.

I won't bother summing up the origins of Snow White, because everyone probably already knows it. In this version, the evil queen (Julia Roberts) has been ruling the kingdom for ten years, ever since the king (Sean Bean) was presumed dead because of a monstrous beast in the woods. His daughter Snow White (Collins) has practically been a prisoner for that decade, not realizing that the queen's expensive tastes are grinding the commonfolk into poverty.

Now that the queen has bankrupted her whole country, she's on the prowl for a rich guy to refill the coffers -- and when the wealthy young prince Andrew (Armie Hammer) turns up, having been robbed and stripped by bandits, she decides he's her next husband.

When Snow White finally figures out how cruel the queen is, she ends up fleeing into the snowy woods, where she is taken in by a group of dwarf bandits with... accordion legs. She soon becomes one of them after a training montage, gets a costume change, and manages to rescue a bespelled, puppy-like Prince Andrew from a wedding. But unfortunately her stepmother has figured out that Snow White isn't dead, and is determined to fix that problem.

I am not sure whose brilliant idea it was to make the story of Snow White a wacky comedy. Seriously, it's not something that comes to mind when I think of Grimm's fairy tales. But the resulting movie is... not terrible. It's not that good either, especially since it seems acutely aware of its own arch humour.  But it does have an airy, artificially-flavoured charm, especially when it veers away from the traditional fairy tale and tries to do its own thing.

The story itself moves along at a brisk pace, with lots of wacky jokes (the dwarves keep getting locked in their own house), modern dialogue (""There's 'I'm in the same room as a prince' crazy, and then there's good old fashioned plain traditional psycho crazy"") and the queen constantly saying not-witty ""funny"" things that seem to be winking at the audience. It's pretty pedestrian until Prince Andrew and the dwarves enter the story, when it suddenly gets an injection of life, and the story feels less pristinely Disneyesque and more like a well-rounded comedy.

And as usual, the story kind of pales beside Tarsem's direction. There are some missteps (the forest seems to be about an acre square and filled with fake trees), but he brings a genuinely spellbinding aesthetic to the magic and costuming -- for instance, the ""mirror mirror"" actually involves the queen walking through a portal, and emerging from the sea in a mirror dimension where she can speak to her suppressed ""good side.""

In fact, the entire aesthetic feels very fairy-tale -- the snow-draped castle that seems to be made of marble and spun sugar, with glittering balls and sweeping gowns. But since this is Tarsem, he brings a slightly eccentric, hallucinatory element to his design. Consider the accordion-legs that the dwarves use when robbing people, or the Bollywood musical number that closes out the movie.

One problem is that Lily Collins is.... bad. She is worthy of many cringes throughout the movie's first half, playing another oh-so-pure-hearted, ineffectual princess who talks in a floaty voice and is so wooden you could drill holes in her. She does thankfully improve when the dwarves give Snow White an action-chick makeover, and suddenly she becomes a stronger, more independent heroine who decides SHE wants to save the day. She doesn't become GOOD, but she becomes tolerable.

And while Julia Roberts is quite well-cast as a vain, evil queen, she's miscast in the sense that... it's hard to be upset about someone else being ""the fairest"" when you weren't that pretty to start with.

The real scene-stealers here are Hammer and the dwarves, played by Danny Woodburn, Martin Klebba, Sebastian Saraceno, Jordan Prentice, Mark Povinelli, Joe Gnoffo, Ronald Lee Clark. Hammer's prince is a rather clueless but nice guy who spends a lot of time having bad, wacky things happen to him, and he's a fairly likable person. And the dwarf actors -- despite each having a single defining character trait a la Disney -- are absolutely delightful, with perfect comic timing and plenty of personality.

""Mirror Mirror"" is a movie that teeters back and forth between the sublime and the ridiculous -- and if they had toned down on Roberts' one-liners (""They're just... crinkles!"") and gotten a lead actress who can act, it would have been quite good. As it is, watch it for the seven dwarves.",1425081600,,5246,4.867713004484305

Nothing too scary, lots of action, drama, adventure and romance.

The actors did a good job and were well chosen -- I didn't think I'd like Lilly Collins as Snow White, but she actually did a really good job. I liked the twist in the end (I won't spoil it though).

The sets and costumes were pretty well done, my one complaint was Snow's wedding dress -- I think it could have been designed much better than it was, she kiiiind of looked like a poofy Bronco's fan in my opinion. Orange and Blue just don't work for that situation, I think -- but that's just one small thing.

turdsicle, go for the turdsicle. Hands down best decision you'll ever make.
I have been more entertained by a basket of laundry than I was during the six, long hours (felt like six) of this fairytale dump. And I love fairytales! I once saw a puppet show of Cinderella performed by the mentally handicapped and was ENTHRALLED, so this clearly isn't a ""me"" problem. When my sister declared 20 minutes in, ""I could have farted a better movie"", I genuinely agreed with her. There's no doubt.

2. Julia Roberts has either been kidnapped or is in some sort of blackmail situation, because there is no way she signed up for that willingly. I half expected a hastily written sign to appear in her hand with the words ""help me!"" in blood. The only other plausible explanation is she's dead, and somebody is Weekend at Bernie's-ing her.

Armie Hammer as Prince Charming may be charming but he is certainly not the sharpest pencil in the case.  Nathan Lane, as the underling of the Queen,  gives an extra boost of fun in his usual way.  This is a different take on a classic fairy tale with the drama and wickedness, but with loads of comedy and fun.  Not too scary for kids.",1395187200,,497,4.23404255319149
4758514,4,B005LAII0I,"Please, Hollywood. Stop hiring Julia Roberts. I have never seen her act, yet. All she does is recite her lines.

A wry, high energy retelling of Snow White, recasting her as the heir apparent and a hero and the Queen as self-serving gold digger. The characters work fine--the dwarves have individual personalities, nice relationship between the prince and his valet. Lily Collins is radiant as Snow, and has a pretty good story arc, grows fairly believably in her fairy tale world.

Julia Roberts does her usual posturing, uneven accents and what-does-this-line-that-I-am-saying-mean?  As I watched I was recasting in my head: Meryl Streep (who also postures but somehow makes it work), Julie Walters, Vanessa Williams, Celia Imrie, anybody, please! save me from this Acting I student. It was made the worse for Mare Winningham's stellar supporting role.

Funny thing with the costumes and sets. All the royal were done so we got the idea the queen had spent too much money--what says EXCESS?? So we flitted from Versailles to Victorian England to some Renaissance or Medieval costumes and sets with aplomb. The village of the peasants was pretty much medieval, which was OK.

The movie is quite funny. The costumes are so ridiculous, they entertain the crap out of me, and I'm colorblind and have no sense of style. I just feel like I'm watching something that could only exist in a cartoon where the laws of physics don't apply. The dialogue is quite witty as well, and just edgy enough to be entertaining for adults, but not so over-the-top obscene or dark (like The Huntsman) that you wouldn't want your kids to see it.

My only comment (which isn't a knock on the movie) is that someone needs to introduce this broad to a set of tweezers. Those eyebrows make her look like a werewolf. Seriously, how is she supposed to be the fairest of them all?",1389744000,,710,4.412213740458015

Lots of great humor, poignancy & fun keep this movie fresh & enjoyable. I've seen it 3 times now & not in the least does it loose it's magic.

4758965,1,B005LAII0I,"Admittedly, I am not the target audience for movies like this, but I went along and saw it for free.  That was still more than it was worth--except perhaps as a keyhole view of some of the incoherence of our pop culture for kids of which we should be more aware.  (I live a blessedly sheltered existence most of the time--I don't own a TV anymore.)

From an adult's point of view, the self-contradictory mish-mash of anti-male feminism (name a non-dwarf male character who wasn't made a gross laughing stock in the movie) and ""romance"" is hardly healthy.  Snow White goes from being an attractive, if classically artificial, peroxide blond with bushy black eyebrows to a raven-tressed would-be superwoman midway through the movie--but keeps her original eyebrows, which I suppose symbolically represented her incipient defiance of conventional gender roles around the castle.

Later, after having her consciousness raised by the rather unappealing, politically-oppressed dwarves, symbolized by a makeover of her wardrobe and hair color, she locks up the prince who wants to rescue her when the dragon shows up--newly liberated woman that she is, she doesn't feel she needs a man to defend her.  But then she relies on a magic dagger instead.  Somehow this is a less than convincing display of her newfound self-reliance and skill in the martial arts. ""I don't need a man, because somebody gave me magic"" seems a bit lame to me--even in a fairy tale.

She is, however, truly self-reliant verbally--she is slyly diplomatic in public about the dwarves (obscuring their real, far less appealing character), in contrast to her cynical view of the utility of a full-grown male prince as anything but arm-candy at weddings.  In that she is perhaps not so different than her wicked stepmother.

Meanwhile for the intended audience, children, all the flamboyantly exaggerated special effects really aren't needed.  Small kids are over-stimulated or simply bored by them.  My 6-year old son was soon running around and playing catch with a girl his age at the back of the lawn where most of the crowd sat watching the movie.  Spell-bound, no doubt.

I guess I'm clearly a grumpy old man out of step with the times, but I prefer some tasteful subtlety in children's stories, not this visual and political bombast.  And if we must have a political message, perhaps the solidly plausible feminism of, say, Wellesley's Stone Center would be more persuasive than Hollywood/Bollywood's garbled propaganda.

Personally, I'd far prefer a Rocky and Bullwinkle feature-film version of Snow White to this.  They, at least, had a sense of humor and wry self-awareness when they irreverently delivered cliches with a novel twist.",1376265600,2,2706,5.085972850678733

the movies share many common elements that i don't think were part of the original story- (both queens take a milk bath, scenes with straw huts on water, etc) but mirror, mirror is a live action cartoon, which i might have enjoyed, if i didn't know snow white could handle jumping into the sea to escape the castle walls!!",1366156800,,572,4.153153153153153

First, I loved that fact that the princess had not plucked her eyebrows. This may seem a bit shallow, but my girls have the same trait, and I've always worried that they would be ashamed of this. Having a very pretty girl who didn't slip into the Hollywood stereotype was gratifying.
Roberts was very fun and played the heavy very well. Hmmm... I wonder if she really is that way in real life :))
The only thing I regret is the fact that the monster (an unusual twist) was more handsome than the king.",1364860800,,631,4.3559322033898304

4759349,3,B005LAII0I,"If you are expecting this Movie to stick to the storyline you're going to be surprised.  It is a comedy take on the storyline, and I don't feel that the expression ""twist"" is quite strong enough to convey the unique take on this fairytale, it's a little too far out in left center field for that not to be a real stretch on the reality of it.  The Characters, even the evil ones, (Julia Roberts) are very likeable and ultimately that is what holds this movie together.  Bottom line... it's a cute move, enjoyable even, but it is absolutely ridiculous, and an absolute mockery of the original storyline. If the characters weren't so likeable I would have been so irritated I would have shut it off.  So it works, the cast, the script, the execution.  If You allow it to stand on it's own you will be able to sit back and enjoy it.  If you can't let go of the origninal storyline you are going to be disgruntled, but, hopefully at that point the merrits of the characters will be able to draw you in the way that they did me.",1363046400,,1023,4.302083333333333

4759597,3,B005LAII0I,"Tarsem Singh knows how to give us a gorgeous film. And the set design, costume design (the last film work of visionary Eiko Ishioka), cinematography, all make this a visual feast for the eyes. The script, though very witty and smart, ends up with a rather predictable plot. What made me continue to watch was the production values and the cocktail party way in which the film plays with our expectations of the classic ""Snow White and Seven Dwarves"" tale, making fun of the original, with other retellings, and a film version. Fortunately, the film doesn't very often parody itself, so it remains true unto its own world. There are tons of puns and jokes and reverse twists that remind me of THE PRINCESS BRIDE, and I'm sure the filmmakers were well versed in the Rob Reiner classic.

Entertaining to the very end, the credits begin with a Bollywood-style music video that would make me buy the BD ... if only they'd included the production number as a full-screen extra as many other films do. But no, the disc gives us other things we probably don't need.

The BD is gorgeous, and the film lively and diverting (probably not for younger kids; Julia Roberts had her kids escorted from the set during shots so they weren't exposed to the dialog), I just wish we had that marvelous music video.",1361577600,,1293,4.641921397379913

4759747,5,B005LAII0I,I loved this movie. I thought that it was very well acted. It had to be soooo fun for Roberts to play the wicked step mom. Its not the normal snow white movie but we all still loved it immensely!,1360022400,,195,3.9

4759853,5,B005LAII0I,"I loved Mirror Mirror, I thought it was a very well done movie. Especially with the casting of Julia Roberts as the queen....The fact that it was a little bit of a different take on Snow White was also interesting. Lily Collins played Snow White very well. Very well made. One thing that bothered me-Prince Valentia & Snow White seemed to have no interest in each other after she kisses him. Aren't they supposed to be in love?",1359504000,,427,4.487179487179487

4759856,1,B005LAII0I,"Why would she do this movie?  What a terrible script, terrible twist on this classic story!  I expected at least some modicum of entertainment here but it was awful!  The attempts at humor were pathetic, the prince was irritating, especially when a ""puppy love"" spell was cast on him!  Really?  There was absolutely no reason for this movie to be made.  Also, the end of with the singing was ridiculous... sounded a little like Bollywood?  Utter waste of time.",1359158400,,460,4.746835443037975
4759857,5,B005LAII0I,This is a great movie.  Julia Roberts (as usual) does an awesome job.  Shows a different view on Snow White and it does turn out as we expect it to.,1359158400,,148,3.9
4759858,3,B005LAII0I,I felt that this movie was not worthy of Ann Hathaway and Julia Roberts.  I did not finish watching the movie.,1359158400,,110,4.238095238095238

4759912,4,B005LAII0I,It's a girl movie.  Boys don't like it as much.  Still it is worth the watch.  I liked it and so did my 7-year-old granddaughter.,1358726400,,129,4.08

4759917,2,B005LAII0I,It was not the type I thought it would  be. Mirror Mirror I did not lie Julia Roberts in that type of movie. Title is Mirror Mirror,1357948800,,131,3.8518518518518516

4759970,5,B005LAII0I,"After seeing a few versions of the Snow White story, I really didn't know what to expect of this.  I was impressed!  How do you update a story that has been around forever.  You change the viewpoint.  I actually liked Julia Roberts as the wicked Queen!  And having Snow rescue the prince was just a touch of genius. The dwarves were fantastic. And Nathan Lane.  I love Nathan Lane, and he is fantastic in anything. This movie is one I can and will enjoy watching many times over. It takes everything you thought you knew about the story, and changes it up! And the twist with the king is something you never see coming. Watch it, you won't be sorry!",1357603200,,649,4.366666666666666
4759971,4,B005LAII0I,I think I liked this better than the other Snow White movie that came out recently. Julia did a great job (as usual) and it was interesting seeing her in a villain role. I would recommend this to my friends and family.,1357603200,,218,4.214285714285714
4759972,4,B005LAII0I,"Julia Roberts was outstanding, she looked like she enjoyed her role.  Nathan Lane was superb as usual, and Armie Hammer was an excellent choice as the Prince.  Lily Collins is very pretty but a little stiff.",1357516800,,207,4.722222222222222
4759973,5,B005LAII0I,The Grimm Brothers would have been proud of this version due to the comedy and quirky banter the movie gives.,1357516800,,109,4.5
4759974,4,B005LAII0I,There are few movies that are as entertaining that hold a high enough standard for wholesome family viewing.  Often times the ratings will still contain inappropriate language and situations for a PG rating.  This movie is PG and appropriate for viewers of all ages.,1357516800,,266,5.0227272727272725
4759975,3,B005LAII0I,"The movie had some enjoyable moments and some just plain silly ones.  The hardest part for me was the first 30 minutes, because I couldn't stop staring at Snow Whites humongous eyebrows!",1357430400,,186,4.8125
4759976,5,B005LAII0I,"I loved the movie, so I bought it for my daughter who is 50th.  She has watched it several times.  Guess I will have to borrow it from her to watch it again.",1357430400,,157,3.727272727272727
4759977,5,B005LAII0I,Watched this movie with my 6 year old granddaughter and she really enjoyed it.  Great for adults but not so much action that it scares younger children.  Great improvement over original Disney version of Snow White which scared my grandchildren so badly we had to turn it off after just a few minutes.,1357430400,,301,4.660377358490566
4759978,4,B005LAII0I,"This is a very good take on the classic Snow White tale. It is very visually pleasing and the acting was great. It was also nice to see Sebastian and Ron from the tv series Pit Boss in their acting debuts as part of the seven dwarfs. Julia Roberts was great as usual, and the young lady who plays Snow White really pulled it off, she was vulnerable at times and then really stepped up and showed her tuff side when the time was right, and she did a wonderful job of balancing the two, so that you don't fell killer she was just totally helpless.

This isn't a adult take like Snow White and the Huntsman, so if you are expecting something along those lines you are going to be disappointed. This movie is more of a family version, but it is wonderful for what it is and I absolutely recommend it.",1357430400,,796,4.2026143790849675

4760040,3,B005LAII0I,"As I watched this movie with my girlfriend on a date night I realized that she would likely enjoy it more than I. However, I was delighted when I found it equally enjoyable. It was slightly comedic. There were moments where I had a good laugh. The story line was a unique twist in comparison to other renditions of the story. Seeing as I rented this for $3.99 it was definitely worth the money.",1357344000,,394,4.337837837837838
4760041,4,B005LAII0I,Fun for the family.  Visually stunning.  Six year old girl and her eight year old brother both enjoyed the film.  So did mom and dad.,1357344000,,133,4.24
4760042,4,B005LAII0I,The  movie  is  a  new  twist to an  old  classic its  story  brings a  new  and refreshing  twist  to  an  already  legendary story the  cinematography and  choreography  is  well  done. furthermore  the  character development  is  quite  interesting in its  own  right this  is  something I  recommend seeing it  is adventure  from the first few minutes check it  out,1357257600,,369,4.793103448275862
4760043,3,B005LAII0I,"A contemporary spin on a familiar tale and a glib sense of humor make MIRROR MIRROR an entertaining film.  Julia Roberts plays the Wicked Queen with a devilish cynicism and narcissistic flourish.  Lily Collins is both demure and flirtatious as Snow White and Armie Hammer is a fine Prince.  Nathan Lane is delightful as the Queen's bumbling aide and Mare Winningham is fun as the baker lady.  All of the seven dwarves/bandits are perfectly cast, each having distinctive persomalities.  The movie is visually impressive, capturing a mystical fairy tale landscape.  My main complaint is the movie's over use of lengthy sword fights, which seemed to serve as padding.
Overall, MIRROR MIRROR is a fun diversion with a wide appeal.",1357257600,,726,5.0588235294117645
4760044,5,B005LAII0I,"Loved this movie- I watched it on Netflix and ordered it the next week. Well done and a sweet story.  It is your typical Disney story, cheesy and all about finding true love!  Julia did an awesome job as the wicked queen, with her humor it moves the story along quickly.
Directed well, and the film was just very well done!  I enjoyed watching it.  It is also kid friendly! If you are a Snow White fan, go ahead and give this one a watch.  I loved it!

4760047,2,B005LAII0I,The Magic of the story is not found in this version. Full of old punch lines.  It departs from the original story in an unoriginal fashion and takes a leave for a seemingly political twist to turn a focus on taxes. Not Julia Roberts best performance.  Disappointing.,1357084800,,266,4.638297872340425
4760048,4,B005LAII0I,It was a cute movie but somewhat slow. I thought it was going to have a little more action in it.,1356998400,,97,3.6666666666666665

It is a re-telling of the classic Snow White fairytale, but updated.  Sometimes and in some ways this is not a bad thing, and at times it works in this movie.  Overall I hate to say it, but the movie tries to hard and in the end is just kind of forgettable.  Although if you have children between 6 and say 14 it may not be.",1356393600,,382,3.935064935064935

The cast seems to be having fun.  There are actual little people playing the dwarves.  You're never clutching your heart in fear watching this, but more often than not you are smiling.

4760255,3,B005LAII0I,"Mirror Mirror is like the opposite of Snow White and the Huntsman. Where the latter movie tried to depict a serious, grim fairy tale, Mirror Mirror tries to be hip and lighthearted. For kids, this might work, but for adults the humor often falls flat and feels out of place. The movie is very light on plot or character and seems to try to fill the time with these silly moments. Another problem is that Julia Roberts tries to make this her movie, but she can't pull off a threatening evil queen. Overall, this movie will probably go over fine with kids or young teens, but I have to wonder why it was made at all.",1355270400,,614,4.301724137931035

Rarely have I seen costumes and sets play such pivotal parts.

This fun filled romance has a first rate beast at the end.

The thrilling plot developments and wonderful acting keeps the show engaging.

I greatly appreciate the clever way the background of the tale is introduced.

The end has all those boring credits along with a beautiful music video kind of clip.

Yes Julia Roberts does a great job here but she is not alone in making this magical show.

I would recommend this movie for the following.
Family night
Romantics
Children
Girlie girls
Insomniacs
Baby sitters",1354838400,,654,4.734513274336283

Just a few innuendos (that a child would not catch) and the rest fine for an 8 year old.  These kind of movies, that young and adult can watch and enjoy, are hard to find.  No the plot did not follow Disney's animated classic, but who would want it to?  Just as the fairy tales themselves, there are dozens of re-tellings and each one has a different take on a story.

There were some funny moments in the movie but they didn't completely compensate for the greater abundance of ordinary moments. There were also some new and clever plot twists that caught me by surprise but not enough to make me want to watch this particular rendition of Snow White again.

The real focus of the movie is the evil stepmother who is played by Julia Roberts; Snow White, played by Lilly Collins attempts to regain her throne and restore the kingdom which had suffered under the evil queen. Some of the most creative moments involved the seven dwarfs and their income producing activities. The special effects were all satisfactory and made their contribution to the progress of the story.

An interesting aspect is the twist on the portrayal of the Seven Dwarves. ""Prince Charming"" is a rather flimsy character. When Snow White manages to dance with him at the castle and tell him of her dilemma, he pledges to help her; however, he almost immediately decides she is insane and ought to be stopped. He is disdainful, arrogant, offensive, and ridiculous. This film could have been very strong; instead, it is glaringly lacking on so many levels.

Along with a great cast of Lily Collins and Armie Hammer, they continued to add life to the film.  Then you add the seven dwarves to the mix and the classic tale gets a nice addition.

There were some good special effects (when she goes through the mirror), the seven -- I'm gonna say it! -- DWARVES were great (on stilts while being bandits and each with a different wonderful personality), but all that can't make up for lameness this epic.  I am so glad I only rented this movie and didn't waste my money to see it in the theater.  I'd give it a rotten tomato if I could!

4761000,3,B005LAII0I,"""Mirror Mirror"" is a family picture based on a tale of Snow White. Directed by Tarsem Singh (""The Cell,"" ""The Fall,"" and ""Immortals""), the film is great to look at (Oscar-winning designer Eiko Ishoika's final work), and some characters are fun to watch, but the retold version of a well-known fairy tale does not offer much else.

""Mirror Mirror"" retains most of the elements found in a Brothers Grimm book - a dark forest, a magical mirror, a poisoned apple, a kiss, etc. - but they are used in a totally different way. In the modern-day take of the fairy tale, the heroine Snow White (Lily Collins) learns swordsmanship, fights for her own destiny, and changes the others' for the better. Well, except one.

Julia Roberts plays a wicked queen. Actually she plays two roles, the queen and her (much darker) reflection. Perhaps I am not the only one who thought the cynical version of her on the magical mirror is more interesting than the ""original,"" which somehow lacks the complexity the other is given. Things liven up when the queen attempts to entice the rich and handsome prince (Armie Hammer) into marriage. We need more of it.

This is not to say ""Mirror Mirror"" is bad. It is just most of the film's episodes are tame. The film needs a narrative that is faster and brisker. The rousing musical number at the end (a Bollywood-style rendition of an old Nina Hart song) has the razzle-dazzle and fun that is much needed in the narrative that precedes it.",1349568000,,1461,4.655038759689923

4761003,4,B005LAII0I,"I'll confess that I liked this version better than the ""Snow White & The Huntsman"" movie that I saw just a week before because it was a tad brighter and lighter than the ""Huntsman."" I guess I was expecting both movies to be a more real-life enactment of the childhood Disney stories. I did like the bantering of the dwarves and their place within the story line, making it more fun to watch; however, was surprised that they took on the presence as self-centered and outcasts. All in all the movie left me a little SLEEPY but I'm HAPPY to give it a 4-star review.",1349568000,,563,4.371428571428571

4761005,4,B005LAII0I,"My wife and I found the film to be quite a bit of fun to watch. As usual, Nathan Lane is a stitch and has some great lines. Julia Roberts looks quite hot in her dresses (it's okay to say that since my wife already knows that was the main reason I found the costuming to be entertaining as well as the film). The dwarves are a lot of fun as well. If you want an experience in opposites, watch this film and then watch Snow White and the Huntsman. The passage from light to darkness will astound you even though the story is essentially the same.",1349481600,,544,4.093457943925234
4761006,4,B005LAII0I,"Julia Roberts was, as always, the best.  The movie was not as good. It was not what a young child would understand.  More for adults and young adults.",1349481600,,150,4.321428571428571
4761007,3,B005LAII0I,I expected this movie to be a little faster paced than it was based on the story it's based off of. Overall it was good just don't expect to be on the edge of your seat at anytime throughout the movie.,1349481600,,201,3.926829268292683

4761098,3,B005LAII0I,"It was a little weird for my taste on a classic fairytale. If it weren't for Nathan Lane I don't think I could watched the entire movie. The dwarves were OK. The prince was a little too wimpy for my tastes. Now I know why ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" was more successful. Costumes were defintely overkill.",1349136000,,306,4.385964912280702

4761103,3,B005LAII0I,"This was an interesting take on the tale of Snow White. Seeing Julia Roberts as a ""bad guy"" was fun. Entertaining, but the character development could have been better. Kids will like it. The CGI was very good.",1348531200,,210,4.552631578947368

4761106,5,B005LAII0I,"This was a very enjoyable, entertaining movie. Julie Roberts dropped some good one-liners as the evil step-mother, Lilli Collins did an excellent job as a Snow White who was considerably more proactive than Disney version. The seven dwarves were a hoot and quite heroic. All in all, the film gave us a very nice evening, one we will repeat.",1348531200,,340,4.779661016949152

The Grimm version, not the Disney version.
And......
I liked it, but I didn't love it.
Some of the comedic aspects seemed forced.
The acting was top notch however.
The FX were wonderful.
The score and pacing were done well.
All in all I recommend a rental.
It's a wonderful movie filled with many things to like but it was just shy of being great.",1348444800,,447,4.209302325581396

4761160,2,B005LAII0I,Julia Roberts who I enjoy as an actor killed her character for me with the in and out faulty accent from no where. Though the story is pretty good I felt it was inconsistant and often tedious rythmically. The humor was also often more painful than funny. I enjoyed the minor characters the most!,1348272000,,295,4.481481481481482
4761161,5,B005LAII0I,"I just adore this movie.  If you like silly, funny, lighthearted entertainment, this is a good choice.  The costumes and sets are gorgeous and the characters are varied and funny.  Julia Roberts is adorable and perfect for the part and the dwarves are far removed from the Disney model and good campy fun.",1348185600,,305,4.716981132075472

Having Snow White to be such a strong character and leader was great!

4761248,2,B005LAII0I,"I was looking for something smart with good character acting...I mean, we all know the story. Instead, the script was unimaginative and cute (not my taste).

4761249,3,B005LAII0I,"This movie takes a new spin on the tale of Snow White and is a sweet little flick. It boasts a pleasant fairy tale feel from start to finish, and is garnished with wonderful scenery and costume design that add well to maintaing the atmosphere. Lily Collins is impressively perfect in the main role, shining as a sweet and endearing title character and looking just plain adorable. Julia Roberts as the evil queen does an okay job, but isn't really given much to do other than look irritated for most of the film. The dwarfs were fun and provided little quips that gave them a little more edge than what we've seen in previous adaptations. While I enjoyed it enough (mostly because I was enchanted by Lily Collins), it is also a little forgettable because the story just doesn't quite get where it needs to go and everything feels a bit vague and distant. Still, I would watch it again if it popped up on TV, and I especially think younger age groups will be drawn to this movie. It's worth a watch; just don't expect it to blow your mind.",1347408000,,1038,4.439790575916231

4761252,5,B005LAII0I,"If you've read other reviews, you got the idea about the movie. This is a wonderful movie and I love the blue ray DVD and dig copy deal, it's a good deal. Some people don't like it, but I love the characters, villain, dwarves, prince and lily Collins. Thought it was an interesting twist and a fun ride. The chemistry and style is fun, witty and can appeal to male and female; young and old. It's one I'd those films you should check out for yourself, by watching before you buy. It's a fun, charming, fantasy movie. Enjoy. I know I did!",1347148800,,537,4.2745098039215685

4761254,5,B005LAII0I,"As the title says.  If you expected this to be anything but a breezy flick with some overdone but entertaining acting and a witty if not completely original script then you had some very unrealistic expectations.  Just sit down get something good to eat, some people you love, and enjoy the silliness, the sweetness, that is a modern Snow white.

I also appreciated the message inherent.  In a culture that obsesses over beauty this a breath of fresh air.",1347148800,,455,4.7215189873417724

4761256,4,B005LAII0I,"This movie was enjoyable, but could have been done better. I was disappointed in Julia Roberts role. She is such a great actress and I have loved everything she has done except this one role. She was not convincing enough to pull off the evil stepmother/witch role. Everything else about the movie was pretty good. This is not a movie for very young children.",1347062400,,359,4.625

4761328,4,B005LAII0I,This was a good movie. It wasn't the tradtional story of snow white but I don't think it needed to be. It was funny and still had some of the tradtional elements of snow white. A great family movie.,1347062400,,198,4.102564102564102
4761329,4,B005LAII0I,"It was different and not very ""traditional"" but still without ruining the idea behind the original story.  If you are a purist when it comes to old fairy tales, you won't like it.  But it was clever, inventive, and humorous.",1347062400,,224,4.575

Shes a mega-star and stars like that wouldnt lower themselves to this cheese. RIGHT?!?! It was the worse movie she ever made. What was she thinking? I mean really what? I really really really wanted to like it. I'm a huge Julia Roberts fan, but this movie may have changed my mind about her.

This movie was neither humorous nor dramatic, they try to mix both genders at the same time and the result are 100 minutes of nonsense and torture!!! It is a pathetic attempt to innovate.

4761457,4,B005LAII0I,"This movie is visually spectacular and has an interesting plot.

It pleased both a 50yo dad and a 9yo daughter.

And the film is a bit profound. It is a story about female aging and the agony of losing beauty and being surpassed by the younger woman.

Based on the previews, I really didn't think I'd like it, but it's actually pretty good.  It's a little bit of a twist on Snow White, but you'll still know the basic story.  Julia Roberts gets top billing, but Snow White is still the star.  She just has a little more girl power this time.",1346889600,,394,4.064935064935065

4761580,1,B005LAII0I,This movie was a waste of my time and money. There were so many failed attempts at humor that it was just painful to watch. This surely isn't one of Julia Robert's best roles. Snow White was not believable as a heroine at all. I suffered through the remainder of the movie only because I paid to watch it.,1346889600,,305,4.186440677966102

4761680,5,B005LAII0I,This is a quirky retelling of Snow White with some really funny scenes and has Julia Roberts actually playing the bad guy ! It is definitely worth watching-no horror in this one-at least not the graphic blood and guts that seems to be so pathetically popular with movie makers these days. There is a lot of sarcastic humor which enhances the role of the 'evil queen'.,1346889600,,367,4.575757575757576

4761798,4,B005LAII0I,"This tale is partially narrated by the evil queen (played by Julia Roberts) but a great deal of it eventually focuses on Snow White. The tale in itself would be predictable and dull if they didn't take certain liberties with the fairy tale. The biggest change is that Snow White is more of a heroine than a peaceful damsel in distress and she turns to banditry with her dwarf friends. There's a lot of light humor (sometimes using modern context) within which helps propel the tale forward.

Lily Collins plays Snow White and Armie Hammer plays the charming prince, who ends up coming across as lovable oaf at times. At first he's to marry the wicked queen but his heart, of course, remains for Snow White. He does a good job when under the wicked queen's love potion (called ""Puppy Love"") but the real male stars are the dwarves. The epilogue shows what happens to the dwarf bandits who helped Snow White secure her kingdom. A dance score follows with the end credits.

There are obvious themes of true love and believing in yourself. Nothing too deep, mind you, but all in light fun.

Snow White is a tale from the Brothers Grimm. This particular version of it had a budget of $85M and so far has made over $162M at the Box Office.

I was truly happiest in the noted characters (more about that later) with Julia Robert's part in the telling of the Evil Queen - but that was about it. Nathan Lane? You must have been paid well. Prince Charming - Arnie Hammmer's best scene was when under a spell from said evil queen, behaving as a dog...a puppy, to be exact. Let's face it, it isn't as though he needs the money, is it? Lily whoever the heck she is as Snow White really needed her eyebrows plucked - I mean REALLY - and even hairier, her character took nearly identical ideas and scenes from Once Upon a Time on ABC. The Seven Dwarfs were by far the best actors and entertainers of all however, keeping closest to the original tale characters, and kept me watching the darn movie...yet these incredible actors received so very little accolades it was sad and downright wrong. Grimm's Fairy Tales are all melded with horror, intended to be so, and this? Well, I'm sorry I bought it. Actually bought this nonsense, yes, I admit it. According to Bollywood-style, there was, of course, a dancing/singing piece at the end after Snow White did NOT eat the poison apple! Who thought of THAT anyway? I literally forced my endurance of a piece of the ending which was, of course, the singing dancing happy happy joy joy Bollywood junk. Arnie? You have two or three left feet, but you're nice to look at in the scenes that took advantage of your chest hair. The storyline is not at all like the original, though it could have been enjoyable, had it had any merit of course - which it doesn't. Sadly looking at my wallet having been plucked by this awful film, I look forward to Snow White and the Huntsman to purchase - hmmm, perhaps rent, as well as continuing to watch Once Upon a Time and Grimm - both (almost) free on HULU.

Julia Roberts and Nathan Land stole the show. Julia, the Queen, was the perfect protagonist, hateful and likable at the same time.
Nathan Lane was there for the adults, his humorous riffs had me laughing, and kept me entertained. The Prince, Snow White, and the Queen, never seemed to jell. No charisma from SnowWhite or the Prince. However, the scene with the Prince acting like a puppy was his best. The seven dwarves seemed to genuinely like each other, and they were the hit of the film for my granddaughter. They had the charisma the rest of the film lacked.

The music was well done, the art effects terrific! Essentially, this Grimm Fairy Tale was that, grim.

4761931,2,B005LAII0I,"Fairy tales are the new vampires. The stampede into fairyland has become rather crowded lately: dueling features have covered the legend of Snow White on television like ""Grimm"" and ""Once Upon a Time,"" and on the big screen ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" vs. ""Mirror, Mirror.""  And if you're feeling really generous, Asylum's direct-to-video ""Grimm's Snow White.""

""Mirror, Mirror"" is a Cliff Notes version of the original fairy tale.  You know the drill: evil but beautiful stepmother turned queen, Snow White, a dashing prince, and a mirror.  That's about all director Tarsem Singh really remembers about Snow White and it's all you need to know to enjoy this vehicle that stars Julia Roberts.

Julia Roberts is in this movie a lot. She's the evil queen.  The evil mirror reflection that lives in the mirror in a hut on a lake looks just like her (played by Lisa Roberts Gillan).  Roberts preens, she sneers, she glares, she makes mutters possibly ad-libbed barbs, and despite taking up fifty percent of the movie's screen time has remarkably little to do.

Oh right, the other characters.  There's Snow White (Lily Collins), so lovely and angelically lit that she seems more like a mannequin than a real person. Prince Andrew Alcott (Armie Hammer, is distinguished primarily by his ability to take off his shirt and act like a dog (literally and figuratively as he displays charming misogyny with several whacks to White's rear during a sword fight).

The only characters of substance are manservant Brighton (Nathan Lane) and the racially diverse seven dwarves: Butcher (Martin Klebba), Chuck (Ronald Lee Clark), Grimm (Danny Woodburn), Grub (Joe Gnoffo), Half Pint (Mark Povinelli), Napoleon (Jordan Prentice), and Wolf (Sebastian Saraceno). At least the dwarves get to walk around on stilts.

The plot lurches along with the usual beats.  Boy meets dwarves, shirtless boy meets girl, girl meets dwarves, REVOLUTION! And then a Bollywood song.

Singh clearly had too much budget to work with - for reasons that are never explained, the evil queen has to walk through a mirror on one side and rise out of water on the other.  Someone gets turned into a cockroach.  But the bulk of the budget is reserved for the breathtaking sets, the gorgeous costumes, and Julia Roberts.

As a kid's vehicle to pass a few hours, ""Mirror, Mirror"" is a pleasant confection.  But as a movie of substance it's pretty dull.",1344643200,3,2406,4.975
4761932,2,B005LAII0I,"I was expecting to have fun watching this, but instead... I found myself actually a bit irritated and put off. Definitely not my cup of tea as far as fanciful comedy, or however you want to catagorize this. Very disappointed.",1344643200,,225,4.65
4761933,4,B005LAII0I,"I've been wanting to rent this one but every time I went to the movie store they were all rented out or decided to get something else. I thought maybe I lucked out in not wasting my money becuase of the rather negative reviews here and other places. But I have learned my lesson on that (both good and bad) so I tend to really not listen to reviews and judge for myself. Well one night I was watching two of my nieces (which I do on a semi regular basis) and when we went to the movie store, this was in. With the PG rating it was very appropriate for our evening so we wouldn't have to rent something they've already seen or watch something at my house over and over again. I find it rather hard to find family friendly movies without the adults having to always watching kiddie movies, especially when you are dealing with age ranges where one can only watch G/PG and the other can watch a little bit more. When it comes to the age range that's too old to watch cartoons all the time and not old enough to watch the content in a lot of the PG 13 movies that come out -- even if they are technically old enough to. The older one of my many nieces/nephews is very mature for her age but it's not like she's allowed to watch anything she wants to. So she's in an awkward position at times. I do enjoy kid's animation movies but even during family night you just want to watch something a little more on your level without having to wait when the kids aren't around. Just seems like there's been slim pickings without watching a ""cartoon"". Well needless to say it was a great decision because my nieces loved the movie and I enjoyed it as well. We actually had it playing on a loop the next day while we were doing things around the house. It would've been something I would have enjoyed just watching on my own...and I'm 26 and not the type to sit around at home and watch movies on a regular basis because of my busy schedule and social life.
I think people are thinking way too deeply about this movie because I definitely don't get where they are coming from, even having an open mind to try to see why others are thinking that way. If you aren't into movies that are ""re-done"" in any way, then don't rent it, duh! Someone thought it was going to be the same story but with real people playing the characters. Um, did you see the previews or read the summary?? It's not like it had the same name and by the name Mirror Mirror you would think it would revolve more around the queen or something, obviously. This is only common sense. I personally think Julia Roberts did a great job playing the queen, not sure why people had a problem with that at all...and I'm pretty picky about my movies because I don't have time to waste on bad ones. Someone mentioned she wore the same dress too many times. Who the heck cares?! I don't watch every Julia Roberts movie by any means but she has the skill to play any role successfully. She's been in every type of movie. Others said the characters had no depth. Really? Well considering it's more of a family movie, I don't think that's necessary and I think there was more than an appropriate amount of depth.
Seems like there are people that are making a big deal out of Snow White and the Huntsman saying it's going to be so great, so what is the difference in this? They are from 2 different perspectives...hence 2 different movies. Snow White and the Huntsman is supposed to be for older viewers, if I understand correctly, so maybe folks should take that into consideration. I even saw a review that someone didn't like the dwarfs on stilts. Well, it's a fight scene and they plainly explain/show why, so I have no idea why you wouldn't get that. It's not in anyway offensive, too silly or out of context.
I wish this would have got as much hoopla at Snow White and the Huntsman actually considering there are 2 Snow White-type of movies coming out in a short amount of time.
All around, this isn't a bad movie at all. It's not a serious drama and it's not extremely juvenile. I would definitely have no problem buying it for my nieces not only because I like it but they LOVED it, and are different age ranges.",1344643200,,4157,4.303571428571429

4761999,2,B005LAII0I,"I have to say after watching so many modern day versions of fairy tales I've decided I've joined to ranks of old fogies. I just don't like new fangled updates of classic tales. Perhaps that's not fair. Reworking a classic fairy tale while not saying so directly has turned out okay for some films. But to say this is the real thing when it's not makes for some bad movies. Like MIRROR MIRROR.

From all the advertising and promotions you would think that this movie isn't about Snow White at all and in a sense you'd be correct. It even begins with the evil queen narrating the tale. As played by Julia Roberts all I could think of while watching this was that she's gone from a talented actress to one that wants to be the center of attention. The evil queen is a part of the story but not the focus.

The fairy tale gets twisted to suit the needs of the actors involved with the King marrying the Queen (Julia Roberts) while Snow (Lilly Collins) is young, disappearing and leaving the Queen in charge. Snow lives more along the lines of Cinderella without the work involved, forced to stay out of the public eye while the queen throws parties and more.

Traveling through a local forest is Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) seeking fame and fortune. Unfortunately he is set upon by bandits in the form of seven dwarves on bouncing stilts. Robbed of clothing and money, the Prince is saved by Snow and taken to the castle where the Queen takes a fancy to him, not just because of his looks but because her constant spending has left the castle treasury empty. When Snow catches the eye of the Prince the Queen becomes jealous and has her taken to the forest to be killed, but we know how that ends.

Instead Snow finds the home of the thieving dwarves and asks to be taken in just for the night. Finally relenting, they allow her to stay and find themselves enjoying her company and help. She stays and they teach her how to survive which comes in handy when the Prince shows up later and is accosted by the dwarves once again.

The story goes back and forth with the love interests played out nicely and the Queen fulfilling the role of being evil and nasty. The whole poisoned apple that so many remember from the story (and of course the Disney version) is tossed out only to be dropped in at the last minute but played out differently. The kiss from the Prince to save Snow in the traditional sense is gone as well. And just so you know this isn't your grandparents telling of Snow White, a Bollywood song is tossed in at the very end.

The acting seems plain to me and in parts somewhat amateurish or perhaps it was just the script and the things the actors were doing on screen. The concept of the dwarves becoming steam punk looking robbers didn't set right with me. It shows children that stealing is okay if you have a reason. And the concept of taxing the poor seemed more out of Robin Hood than the story of Snow White. Is this something children understand yet? Then again with the way things are going perhaps the sooner they learn about taxes the better.

I'm sure this is me just not feeling that the story needed retelling or rebooting but while it looked gorgeous it just felt empty to me. I know my great great niece loved it, then again she's 6 and my guess is hasn't seen the Disney version. Knowing that, perhaps the kids in your house will enjoy it as well. But for me it was just a movie to pass time, like a fast food meal that fills you up but leaves you unsatisfied.",1344470400,,3488,4.36517719568567

Anyway, I was looking forward to seeing this film, as well as ""...the Huntsman"".  I knew this would be a much lighter offering, but the makers of the flim, IMO, never really nailed down whether this film was for kids or grownups, and as a result had a confusing mixture of both that was not at all satisfying.

Roberts plays a frustrated but not quite wicked enough queen who seems to get her thrills seeing this film's version of Prince Charming standing there shirtless...multiple times.  Snow White, though innocent, comes across mainly as bland, and I'm sorry, but the dwarves on stilts thing just doesn't work for me.

All in all this movie was a disappointment, and I'm glad I waited to see this movie on DVD.

4762192,4,B005LAII0I,"""Mirror Mirror"" is a movie that is a cute rendition of the classic fairytale. But what is admirable is that the movie isn't trying to be anything else other than a nice and sweet story. The tone and pace are set perfectly for this kind of rendition. The actors also fit very well into their roles.
Julia Roberts is obviously having fun being the conceited queen and has some fun scenes. One could even argue she has the better female role. Lily Collins does very well holding her own but at times seems a bit nervous and uncomfortable but this being her first starring role she clearly shows she has room to grow. Armie Hammer plays his fumbling prince charming without missing a step and sweeps Snow White off her feet.
But the best part in my opinion are the dwarves. They each have a whimsical personality that sets them apart and are the most entertaining characters in the film. Nathan Lane, Sean Bean and Mare Winningham do well with what they've got but it would have been nice to see more of them. What stands out most are the lush visuals that are not shy of using vibrant colors and the costumes are quite alluring visually.
In short, if cute and campy isn't your kind of humor than maybe wait for ""Snow White and The Hunstman"" for a different take on the story. But if you don't mind a silly good time and some very nicely designed eye candy then enjoy this movie with an open mind.",1343952000,,1393,4.403100775193798

4762196,3,B005LAII0I,"This is a campy and humorous twist on the Snow White story.  Julia Roberts is the middle-aged wicked queen who has a fiscal problem in her palace and wants to marry into some money to solve it.  Lily Collins is the 18 YO ""Snow"" who gets out from under the Queen's thumb and is becoming independent, liberated and more assertive.  The seven dwarfs are played by .... seven dwarf actors, who are disgruntled bandits (they get on stilts and do acrobatic manuevers when they rob a victim).  Roberts the Queen has her Cougar eye on a younger boy-toy prince (played by Arnie Hammer) who keeps getting his clothes robbed by the bandits and shows up in front of her without a shirt.  But of course, Snow and the Prince are really in love.  The Queen's assistant is played by the very funny Nathan Lane.  Lots of fun little scenes and a nice, competant, entertaining fairly forgettable plot.  The dwarfs are a funny, edgy bunch, with good interplay and banter. The strong, independent Snow (taught by the dwarf bandits) duels creepy puppet zombies, the Prince himself, and the ""beast"" at the end.  I guess she's supposed to be the new role-model for strong, successful women, while the men (the Prince, the Assistant) are silly twits.  Roberts plays a good wicked queen character in another strong female role.  Like a pushy middle-age Cougar boss at work.

I thought that it was a PG-13 but it seems the MPAA rates it a PG.  One non-family-friendly part is when the Queen's assistant is turned into a cockroach by magic.  When he ""gets better"" he's bemoaning his nightmare, saying that ""the worst part was, a grasshopper had his way with me!""  Ha-ha.  Try explaining that to your 10 YO child, that he was buggered by another insect.  Except for that purposefull (and these days it's obligatory for decadent Hollywood, even for ""family movies"") use of sexual innuendo, Mirror Mirror is overall entertaining comedy/fantasy with a women's lib theme.",1343779200,,1938,4.771771771771772

4762318,4,B005LAII0I,"There are only so many ways one can expect to have the tale of ""Snow White"" retold without it just becoming a retread.

""Sydney White"" was one remarkable example of outside-the-box thinking, but here, ""Mirror Mirror"" chooses to stick with the period instead of modernizing the setting, and veers off the familiar path through the woods to explore some other aspects of the characters involved.

Without any spoilers, the Queen's vanity-driven blood lust becomes more understandable (if no less unforgivable); Snow White's cruel domestic treatment leads not to her devolving into a mindless nymph who is happy to set up house with seven strange little forest-dwellers, but rather a young woman of remarkable strength and tenacity; and the Prince... well, while he still remains a pretty face with a great body for stylish clothes, he does for once become an actual human with passions and foibles, making him more than just eye candy but another hero to root on in this comic saga.

The cinematography is top-notch, as is the acting and writing. The Dwarfs -- each one proving to be a skilled comic actor -- easily run off with huge chunks of their scenes.

This is not inappropriate for family viewing by any stretch, but this caters to a higher sense of humor. It's Grimm Grows Up, and I'd rank this as palatable and a very pleasant choice for a popcorn-and-comedy night at home.

The film loses one star in my rating for overuse of the mountain of gold fabric that was obviously bought in bulk, a swatch or several yards of which were shoe-horned (""Blue Ball Gown? White portrait collar? STICK A FIVE-FOOT GOLD BOW ON THE BACK, WE STILL HAVE HUNDREDS OF BOLTS OF THAT GODDAMNED SHINY GOLD CRAP TO USE UP!"") into every single costume...",1343692800,2,1737,4.7959866220735785
4762319,4,B005LAII0I,"Mirror Mirror is a modern re-telling of the old Snow White fairy tale.  Based upon live action (rather than animation), the film is loaded with special effects, gorgeous imagery, and action.

One of the main strengths of the film is the active role Snow White takes.  She is not a passive character who exists only as a victim of her evil stepmother that must be rescued by Prince Charming.  Snow fights her way through the film, teaches the dwarves more than one lesson, and even rescues the Prince on more than one occasion.

The other main strength I found in the movie is the fantastic scenery, costumes, and makeup.  I would not be surprised if the wardrobe and makeup were up for award nomination -- Julia Roberts wears what appear to be dozens of gowns and dresses.  The sets are broad and beautiful also.

On the other hand, the acting is over the top, and the slapstick and other humor, particularly involving the dwarves, can get quite silly at times.  The movie is also predictable in spots, though the twists on the old story keep the tale fresher rather than stale.

These complaints aside, most families and groups will enjoy the visual aspects of the movie and the modern take on such a well-known story.",1343692800,,1219,4.627906976744186

The handsome prince is still basically one-dimensional. Nevertheless, this is a fun and funny movie, from the queen's opening monolouge to the Bollywood dance at the end.

Naturally the daughter Snow White (Lily Collins) outshines the Queen and must be dispatched. The tale contains a prince that cannot stay clothed, giant dwarfs, and an evil beast of the forest.

In one scene Nathan Lane is turned into a cockroach. I thought it was a jab at Franz Kafka.

They tried too hard to be cutesy. I must say the absence of animation or songs was refreshing. As usual Julia Roberts made a nice witchy woman. Unfortunately it's also one of those productions that contain ancient close and contemporary snotty language not potty mouth just snotty.

4762408,2,B005LAII0I,"At the beginning of the year we were teased with the prospect of two vastly different live action interpretations of the `Snow White' fairytale.  First released with the family oriented `Mirror Mirror', which looked to take a campy comedic approach and starred the rather washed up (yes, she's a 90's actress who has failed to deliver since her Oscar twelve years ago) Julia Roberts.  The second, which was to be released more in line with awards season, was the dark and fantastical looking `Snow White and the Huntsman' starring the world's favorite celebrity, Charlize Theron.

I was holding out for the `Huntsman'.

Sadly, the stars did not align for me and I had a pretty terrible month with stress filled work environment and sick children and so I never got around to seeing Theron scream her way to victory.  The reviews weren't kind anyways, so waiting for it to be released on DVD isn't that big of a deal, I guess.  My daughter happened to see a commercial for the DVD release of `Mirror Mirror' though, and she was spellbound.  She had to see it and so I buckled and rented it.  I really wasn't expecting much at all, and sadly, I didn't get much either.

Good lord this movie is stupid.

I understand that alterations need to be made to bring this classic story into the modern era.  No, this is a `modern interpretation' but what I mean is that to appeal to modern audiences they felt it necessary to alter aspects of the film.  Sadly, many of the alterations just don't work, and it wound up feeling silly for silly's sake.  The dialog is stilted and unfunny and no one can really deliver them with authority outside of Julia Roberts who is actually really funny here, especially towards the end of the film.  The rest of the acting is a sore spot, with the dead-eyed dull spirit known as Lily Collins completely ruining this film, and the adorable Armie Hammer embarrassing himself in more ways than one.  The dwarfs, all of them, are terrible actors and the alterations made to their characters were ridiculous, from the names (I wanted to punch the television) to their stilts.

Visually, the film is appealing.  The sets and those costumes are delicious, but overall this is just a massive failure.  Tarsem has a track record of creating visually appealing films that don't quite fill in the other areas, but `Mirror Mirror' is his biggest misstep.  At the end of the day, the film is just dull.",1343260800,,2414,4.650943396226415

the Prince are winning personalities. Julia Roberts' role, however, is written in
one key throughout the film, leaving her with little to do other than affect a jaded
cruelty that gets a bit tired. The dwarfs are the film's weakness, because their material

We have a weekly family movie night and I would thoroughly recommend this movie to all.  The only thing I found really hard to get past were the big eyebrows of SNOW WHITE.",1342915200,,468,4.775
4762415,2,B005LAII0I,"OK, in terms of direction and photography this movie is no doubt a visual feast and that it on its own deserves 2 stars *I'm sure it took a lot of effort from the producers of this film and I wouldn't want to undermine their efforts*. However, you don't always judge a book by its cover much like you don't judge a movie by it's customs and special effects. The Storyline will always be more important no matter how flamboyant the cast's clothes looked.

So, unfortunately this film's writers weren't as expensive as Julia Robert's wardrobe for this film. The idea behind Mirror Mirror is that it's meant to be a parody or a comical retelling of the Classic Snow White tale that I'm sure everyone knows from their childhood, but as the openings suggests it's supposedly from the Queen's POV not Snow White. There are 2 sides to every story right? Didn't Happen! It won't be long before anyone recognizes that the story is in favor of Snow White even though she's not supposed to be the main character. The Evil stepmother is still evil, Snow White is still beautiful and the Prince still falls in love with her. The Only twist is that Snow White doesn't end up eating the apple which makes me question the directors choice? What was the point of that apple scene anyways? To ensure that the Oh so evil Marie Antoinette version of this fairytale the step mother dies? Come On! She could've met her ultimate and tragic fate in a different way or to keep things lighter she could've just vanished once and for all.

There isn't much dialogue going on and frankly it's all flat and boring. The Characters are all two dimensional at best except for the Evil step mother but even that didn't save the movie from being lame. The Bollywood ending is also very stupid? To sum it all up, this is movie is for stupid people I don't mean that the people who liked this movie are stupid just that the characters are stupid! I know it's meant to be funny but when was funny equivalent for stupid? And the Macho, Noble Prince wasn't even Macho he was more like a toy actually. They even got the characterization wrong in a bad way.

I know, this is meant to be a kid's movie and I shouldn't take it seriously but even for a PG film this was lame. I can think of Way better films out of the top of my head. With the Economy drifting and expenses rising wouldn't you want to watch something worthwhile? Something entertaining and unique at the same time? To compensate for your money?
Instead of a unoriginal, unfunny retelling of a classic fairy tale that you'll forget about after 2 minutes from the rolling credits?

I think this film would've been more interesting if they made Snow White the evil one and the Step Mother the good one just to shake things up. I mean it is meant to be from her perspective anyways and a wittier dialogue would've been awesome too.",1342828800,,2850,4.464491362763916

Unfortunately, you can only stare at a bauble for just so long before boredom overtakes and attention begins to lag.

While the Queen wasn't particularly funny to me, I thought Julia Roberts played her the way the movie needed. I was glad there wasn't an over-dwelling on the concept of Snow White being the most beautiful at all- in fact, the Prince simply states she is in HIS eyes. Not that she necessarily is to everyone who sees her. This idea of subjective beauty appealed to me quite a bit as between the actresses of Snow White and the Queen, there is a large difference in 'type' of beauty. Over all, the dwarves had a habit of making me grin and the beast was done in wonderful CG. If you expect a ton of character depth...well, that's kind of hard in a story that should feature a minimum of 10 characters (7 dwarves, Snow White, Queen, and Prince). In the end, it's a fairy tale. It's not deep but it's a fun watch. The Bollywood homage at the end was fantastic!",1342224000,5,1022,4.300518134715026

I loved that Snow was still independent and a fighter but yet still remains girly and not turn her into a tomboy. The scenery and costumes were magnificent! The costumes reminded me of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Marie Antionette type costumes but still having originality. You could tell that all the actors enjoyed their roles! Julia Roberts and Lily Collins shined as The Evil Queen and Snow White! I can't wait to see Lily Collins as Clary Fray in the Mortal Instruments movie based on the book series. I think the best actors are the ones who enjoy acting and being the characters they were given rather than just doing it for the money. I also loved that this film was a comedy and it didn't take itself too seriously. I also loved the magic mirror now that was different where you go inside the mirror and go into this alternate world. The ending was a twist that you didn't see coming! I loved the Bollywood number even if it didn't match the movie. I know it didn't do that great in the movies, but I heard more good things about this film than I did with Snow White and the Huntsman and I saw Snow White and the Huntsman and that one was a horrible film.",1341878400,3,1317,4.272
4762642,3,B005LAII0I,"I was expecting this to be a comedy, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite so campy.  It was fun, pleasant, but there were quite a few wrong notes.  I can't decide if it was the editing or the writing, I think it might have been a little of both.  Some of the dialogue were real groaners and some parts seem overworked.

Overall, it could have been better but it wasn't bad.  If the Princess Bride is the gold standard of fantasy comedy at a 5 and Stardust being a 4, this would be a 3 with Drew Barrymore's Ever After being a 3.5.

I thought Julia Roberts was good in the movie.  I liked that the Snow White wasn't a victim in the movie.

I'll watch it again, but it won't end up being a favorite.  I do appreciate that it was something that I could let my kids watch without cringing.",1341792000,5,786,4.0519480519480515
4762643,1,B005LAII0I,"I bought this movie because I was having a friend over, and we have a mutual interest in fantasies and fairy tales. Generally we can find *something* we like about it, but we couldn't even sit through this. I finished it later so I could review it, or else I would have just forgotten about it.

Whatever you do, DON'T FORGET that Julia Roberts is in this movie. Remember that Julia Roberts plays the ""evil"" queen. She is on the posters, the blu ray cover, and on every other post on the movie's Facebook page. From the time they first started marketing this to the end of the flick, they could not stop harping on her being the star. She got way too much screen time considering the plot (what there was of it), and I think they were counting on her star power to sell more tickets.

From the promotion, I thought I was going to at least get some good eye candy, and I did in the animated opening. Then they kept showing the queen in the same yellow dress.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-ve-seen-that-tiara-somewhere-before/dp/B00795C5X4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I've seen that tiara somewhere before.</a>&nbsp;You keep thinking it will get better, but it doesn't. The wardrobe at the queen's wedding was a bitter disappointment, and by the end I think they were digging things out of a recycle bin.

They must have blown the budget by the time they got to animating the lake and the beaver dam in Narnia. Every time Julia Roberts went there, they used the same sequence with her rising up from the water, and the exterior looked like something I could have rendered in Bryce about ten years ago.

The movie is just bad. Remember when it was cool to see a girl swordfight? Now it's just cheesy. They do this in a montage, too. I'm all for strong female protagonists, but they need to stop doing it at the expense of making the men into nothing but comedy fodder and complete fools.

The comedy isn't funny. I get that Julia Roberts' beauty treatments are gross, but I bet they didn't sell a lot of popcorn during that segment. Armie Hammer does his level best to play the bumbling prince, but they don't give him a lot to work with. He is capable of much more. It's hard to play a buffoon when they forgot the funny in the script.

It's a criminal misuse of Nathan Lane. Even Lane can't make this movie funny. I was SO looking forward to seeing him, and it was AGONIZING to watch that much talent wasted. THEN Sean Bean actually manages to chew the scenery when he finally shows up onscreen with the horrible dialogue he's given. It's like watching Ned Stark poof in out of nowhere, deliver a few super serious lines and then just stand around. (That's literally what he does, too.)

Lily Collins' song just doesn't fit with the movie. It looks like they made Sean Bean, Nathan Lane and Armie Hammer watch while they filmed it, too. It was bad enough watching it on screen; I can't imagine having to see and hear it live. You don't see Julia Roberts standing around, though, because she's the STAR, you know, in case you forgot.

I can't believe I almost gave it two stars-- for what?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alan-Menken-s-score/dp/B007HHSFBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alan Menken's score</a>&nbsp;is the only good thing about it, but you can get that separately.

4762644,4,B005LAII0I,"This is kind of an odd film. A number of reviewers have covered the ways in which a well-known fairy tale has been retold. To me, the draw of the film isn't so much that it's a version of Snow White, but rather that it's a quirky re-telling of a fairy tale. There is just enough humor and just enough odd scenes that it keeps your attention. Even the settings are kind of strange. They are a mix of medieval and fantasy. Nathan Lane and Julia Roberts make for a very engaging and comical pairing. The seven dwarfs are played by well-known short actors and are very quirky but funny. This movie seems like it will delve into some cruel or violent scenes, but somehow it manages to always pull back enough not to spoil things. When I started watching the movie it seemed like something from out in left field. By the time I was done, I had been entertained by something just different enough to keep my attention.",1341792000,14,911,4.364705882352941

Some reviewers bashed it for not bringing much new to the story of Snow White, but it's a kid's movie, and kids aren't comparing it to all the other versions. On its own it is entertaining, well-acted, beautifully filmed, briskly paced, and lets the princess fight and make her own decisions. I enjoyed Julia Roberts in this more than I have in any film she's done in awhile, because she seemed to be having fun playing the evil queen, even relishing it. I didn't think she overdid it for a film like this at all. So overall, a very worthy family film for kids 6-10 or so.",1341705600,,673,4.435483870967742
4762748,1,B005LAII0I,"Mirror Mirror is not a good rendition of Snow White. I say this not because it reverses or alters portions of the characters or plot, which it assuredly and poorly does, but because it does not tell a story, really, nor is it really a film. It is a collection of barely acceptable motion picture moments edited together with the hopes that what it adds up to is a smart, cute bit of entertainment. It is, sadly, neither smart, nor cute, nor loveable on the whole, though it has moments of likeability. As a matter of fact, the best part of the film is the end. I say this not because the film is over (though that is a bonus, excepting that dreadful feeling that you want a portion of your life back) but because the totally out of nowhere Bollywood-esque dance number is the icing on the weirdly constructed cake. It is the only charming thing about this boredom inducing heap of edited scenes.

As for characters, I will start with the ok and work my way into the basement. The heroine (Snow White) is somewhat likeable, but there really isn't a reason or motivation for why she does what she does. She is two dimensional: by turns innocent, pretty and idealistic or roguish, courageous and crafty. These two dimensions are sandwiched together without any development of how they fit within the same person. I felt a bit like I was getting into an argument with a person, in this case the director, who thinks that merely asserting the same thing over and over again will win the day. This tactic may be effective on many, but in the end no one feels good about the result.

The Prince character has no redeeming qualities. He is supposed to be the comic relief in a girl-power film. His bumbling and shirtlessness could have been cute or funny. Instead, it's just sort of, well, there.

The Witch is just simply dreadful. Julia Roberts simply cannot save this trite, vapid, monochromatic character. I didn't care if she was gotten rid of or what she was doing to her kingdom because she was simply too much of a caricature. There was nothing familiar about her evil that anyone, even a child, could hang their hat on. Nothing shocking, frightening or even identifiably evil on a human scale. The mirror scenes were inexplicable and became the cornerstone moments for my fascination at the lack of artistic vision in this film. (More on this later)

The dumbest characters were the dwarves, played by real, live dwarves and midgets. They are supposedly converted from being outsiders and thieves to goodness loving cads by the end. They simply annoy throughout, and, given the fact that Snow White is supposed to be the leader who enacts their conversion, the change is totally unwarranted. The short jokes are not funny. Their ""good-heartedness deep down"" isn't really convincing. They made me wish I had taken my wife to see the Avengers in the same theater instead, even though she hates comic book films.

Finally, there are all the artistic licenses throughout the film to create its atmosphere. The locations throughout, from the palace to the forest to the hut in the middle of a mysterious lake where the mirror is, are surreal. They are supposed to be surreal, I get it. But one is left asking why the choices were made for each. The only conclusion I could come to is that some wonkish art major thought a particular concept would look cool and didn't bother to have a vision of how the entire fictional world fit together. Dali paintings are amazing and surreal. This film is not a Dali painting though. It is components of 4 to 6 Dali paintings in a collage held together by dried nacho cheese.  It looks grotesque in the ""no-talent-hack"" sort of way and, more importantly, leaves a horrid taste in one's mouth.

It was once argued that 100 monkeys on typewriters would eventually turn out at least one play of Shakespeare's, merely by accident. Chance and mere operative intelligence is all that is really needed to get a good outcome. Sadly, this theory was tested with real monkeys once. After a week they hadn't even typed a word in any language. Not even a one letter word. The conclusion of course is that you need real intelligence and real creativity in order to even string sentences together on a page; a human mind can perform such things but an untrained monkey cannot. A very highly trained human mind produces Shakespeare's plays. Given the choice between this film or one edited by those same monkeys, I'll take the monkey film. While it would have less order, it would be more entertaining and thought provoking. It would invite a vision onto a blank canvas. Mirror, Mirror is a filled-in canvas painted with the hands of too many painters, all its ideas crashing into each other causing pain and misery for the viewer. Therefore, give me the monkeys.",1341619200,5,4781,4.671021377672209

From the other reviews I read I was afraid I wouldn't care about what happened, but almost immediately  the underdog status of Snow White is made visceral.
The costumes! Eiko Ishioka (who you'll notice in the final credits has the film dedicated to her memory) has taken the very best and most amusing from the 18th century, adds some fantastical flare from our favorite fairy tales and creates yummy eye candy with fabric and color.
The actress who plays Snow White isn't serious enough for my taste.  I was always afraid she was going to break character, but I'm highly critical when it comes to performance.  This is where we credit the casting director, because what the camera picks up from her look alone lends enough vulnerability to her character to make us want to champion her.
The dwarves are all leading men handsome and individually quirky and hand in their own fine performances. The familial/bachelor buddy feel of their clan makes you feel included on some inside joke.

There was some clever contemporary hyperbole, burlesque, asides, wit, allusions and bombastic dialogue/scenes in the script. The costumes, sets and a few green screen effects were industry standard OK except ""see Problems"". But relying on great costuming and set design is like putting make-up on a pig - still a pig.

Problems;
First, miscast. I would have had Katy Perry and Russell Brand (assuming they were talking at that time) for their naturally offbeat improvisational behaviors. Julia Roberts just didn't sell the Queen's role with just her smile (not her fault - bad fit) and any number of others would have been more interesting.
Second, the sets, props and costumes seemed too overbearing Hollywood showoffy-plastic like. It's like the director wanted to have the talked-about walk down the red carpet to showcase his talents.
Third, the green screen graphics had that borrowed, been done before, fantasy look - not very imaginative. Castle with lengthy elevated roadway on craggy cliff with lake, peasant village and dragon.

Julia was entertaining, I actually like how she was bring out the evil queen. I got the impression there were more scenes, or should have been, that developed this character.  Through out the movie, I wanted to know more about the charaters.

Nathan ""Mouse Hunt"" was great in his role.  I actually would like to have seen more of his antics with the villagers and staff, rather than the princess' story.

The dwarfs were interesting, funny at times.  Their hovel, the forest, and the Robin Hood hook are what I wanted to be fleshed out.

Sean Bean, seriously, winter and the beast is a dragon - did he or his agent write this? At least he didn't die from Orc arrows in this fantasy tale.  I the only one that has the impression he was shanghi'd into this. I also suspect the ""Captain"" was line coach for his brief appearance.

  The graphics are really cool on this movie, and the ""mirror mirror"" parts are really awesome to watch. Plus, some of the fighting sequences are entertaining.

Now for the bad things.
  The writers of this film completely turned the story around, and the lessons about true TRUE love in the original are wiped out in this movie. Instead of being masculine, and courageous, the prince is feminine, and Snow White ends up fighting for herself. The dwarves are made out to be thieves, and Snow White joins them, and the spells and enchantments, which I normally like, are too wichcrafty for my taste. Overall, I would recommend to NOT buy this.",1341014400,,705,4.699186991869919
4762865,5,B005LAII0I,"I loved it, from the opening lines to the end.  It was unexpected fun for a Saturday morning rental.  The Queen's lines are just funny... some subtle, some not, just silly fun.  I love that Julia is not made to look perfect and the Prince.. well, puppy love is appropriate.

It's understandable why it failed at the box office, people seem to have lost their sense of humor and perhaps simply did not get the lines being handed out.  Who knows, for me, perfection from the Queen, to the dwarfs straight through Snow White and of course.. Nathan Lane.. love that he got it, like Julia... a fun script is hard to pass up!",1341014400,,619,4.394736842105263
4762866,4,B005LAII0I,"The 411 by Maria:

Yesterday I was feeling a little sick from my intestinal nightmare the night before so out of character for me, I took to the couch and watched a few movies with the kids. One of them was Mirror Mirror.

I was hopeful that this would be good but wasn't holding out hope. I am usually let down by movies lately. Tainted I guess. It is mostly a time thing and if it turns out not to be good, I get upset by the time I wasted.

We start the movie hearing Julia Roberts tell us that this movie is about her, ""the most beautiful Queen"". She tells us that this is her story. Julia is perfect as the Queen. She is evil but not in a scary way for children.

Watching the cartoon version of this Grimms Fairy Tale by Disney still makes kids nervous. My daughter leaves the room when the witch is on screen and I remember closing my eyes too. This is much more enjoyable and no nightmares is always a plus. The world is scary enough when you are a kid.

This movie was enjoyable because:

I wasn't embarrassed to watch it with my kids. Completely child friendly.

The all star cast including some surprises like Mare Winningham (I was wondering where she has been) the King played by Sean Bean from my newest favorite show Game of Thrones and well, Julia. I love her!

It is funny, fast paced, and filled with adventure.

While I have read some reviews I believe this movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously. It is a modern take with a twist on a fairy tale. How can you take that seriously. It is merely a movie created for enjoyment and hopefully you have a laugh.

Great colors and great effects!

I asked the kids what they liked about it:

Handsome loved the 7 dwarfs and found them hysterically funny. "" Those little guys were tough and funny. I liked the crabby guy. He could kick butt!""  (Can't say I blame him. I loved them too! So happy to see Marty on screen).

Goddess ""loved all of it"" When I pressed her, she said, ""it was good because the Queen was mean and in the end Snow White won the battle for the castle. Good always wins over evil! A[...] my girl!

What I loved was that this princess is more modern and not a scared little girl. She is strong and doesn't wait for a prince to ride up and save her on his mighty stead! She's a go getter. A much better role model for my daughter than the ones I grew up wishing I could be like.",1341014400,,2365,4.167032967032967
4762867,4,B005LAII0I,"This movie started somewhat slow and that didn't help with the fact that I had to sit through a chick flick at my girlfriend's request (her choice that night). This chick flick came through quite well.
This movie was saved by two things: The first was the acting of Nathan Laine; and, the second was by the return of Audrey Hepburn to the big screen.
My girlfriend and I soon found ourselves laughing out loud with the antics of Laine and the seven dwarfs.
This is a good date night movie that will give you time to work on your popcorn at the beginning.
Watch it, and tell me that the beauty of Audrey Hepburn doesn't return to the big screen.  I dare you!",1341014400,3,657,4.298387096774194

Instead of having scenes done outside in the forest, they ended cutting trees

The adaptation is silly and poorly written. The annoying weird dog-acting of the prince is not funny, well, maybe for kids it is... The Snow White is uninspiring and dull. The queen is bored and boring. The Prince, even though very hot I have to admit, seemed stupid and lost. The only character that was actually fun to watch was Nathan Lane's Brighton. The ending song seemed like creators' desperate, but failed, attempt to add spark to a dull image.  This movie is nothing but a waste of Julia Robert's talent.

4762964,2,B005LAII0I,We saw this at the movies. There were only 3 or 4 sets through this whole movie. They kept showing the same shot of the castle or the same shot of her coming out of the water. The ending singing and dance scene was so out of place and odd. It felt like you skipped into Slumdog Millonaire. For adults it was bad but my kids enjoyed it. There were some funny dwarf scenes. As an adult I am rating it 2 stars. My kids would probably give it 3 stars.,1340668800,2,447,3.923076923076923
4762965,3,B005LAII0I,"I like the Snow White fairytale.  The combination of dwarves, poisoned apples, and a beautiful princess is a definite classic and one that many have been in love with for ages.  And so there are a lot of remakes of the tale, almost more than any other fairytale out there except perhaps Cinderella.  This one was sweet and innocent and good fun, but ultimately very hokey.

Snow White has grown up in the castle a shut-in after her father's disappearance.  Once a spoiled daughter she's now subject to the whims of her step-mother the Queen, who is only concerned with her beauty.  The story is actually told through the Queen's eyes, sort of, and so we get a glimpse behind why she thinks she does and wants to oppress Snow White.  Using tax money to fund grand parties, the Queen is quickly bringing the kingdom to ruin, and when Snow White finally finds out how the people are surviving, she vows to do something about it.  Which of course brings the attention of the Queen on her and she must run for her life, only to be found by seven dwarves, who have an interesting work all their own.

Characters:
Snow White:  Lily Collins
The Queen:  Julia Roberts
Prince Alcott:  Armie Hammer
Brighton:  Nathan Lane
The King:  Sean Bean

I can't say that any of the actors were well suited to their roles.  Julia Roberts was simply too nice to be an evil Queen, in fact she was more vain and self centered and hardly seemed capable of doing any real harm.  Prince Alcott I just couldn't figure out.  Sure Armie Hammer was nice to look at, but I require a little more from an actor than that.  Not much, but a little more.  Lily Collins as Snow White was ok.  She had a soft spoken way about her and definitely was able to put off that naive vibe.  I do think that Nathan Lane as Brighton was good.  He was the perfect toady for the Queen and always licking her boots.  The Seven Dwarves were definitely individuals and pretty funny, but I just couldn't figure out why one of them was a cowboy.  It seemed a little strange especially with some of the other pairings.

So I did say the movie was hokey.  And it was.  Even the special effects contributed to that.  Although they weren't used often, just seeing little animated stars and such around a characters head causes me to groan a bit.  A little over the top and it was almost like the director was making fun of his own movie and couldn't take it seriously.  You kind of have to have one or the other, because mixing a serious with comedic elements like that confuses the watcher.  At least id did me.  I did enjoy that Snow White could take care of herself in this one.  Much better than having to constantly be rescued by the prince.  She could do anything that he could do, albeit with more dramatic flair.

A cute movie, but not the best remake of the Snow White story.  I think it's definitely appropriate for younger audiences and probably a good family movie to watch.

4762966,1,B005LAII0I,"Not funny. Not a good plot. Julia Roberts is an amazing actress but does not make a good witch. Prince Charming or whoever he is in the movie gets on a person's nerves acting like a dog and stuff. Just overall, a bad twist on Snow White.",1339459200,3,237,4.0638297872340425
4763057,5,B005LAII0I,"I saw this movie twice in theatres and it was awesome! Great script, great actors, really funny, great directing. The song at the end was good but it seemed more bollywood and didn't really fit the movie. Great movie overall, and that's coming from someone who is not a big fan of the snow white tale. I really loved this movie and so did my entire family. I would definately recommend.",1338681600,4,386,4.450704225352113
4763058,5,B005LAII0I,"Though it has all the elements of previous versions (such as the poisoned apple and magic mirror) this retelling of Snow White took the story in a different direction. Basically, the queen wants the prince, who starts out as a bit of a jerk, but he is in love with Snow White who is left in the woods where she is taught how to fight and steal by the seven little men who do not work in a mine.

The new twist is refreshing after seeing the same story told over and over again. Some of the humor is more adult then previous versions, but there is still enough comedy to keep kids entertained. (Though some of the black magic parts might scare very small children.)

Overall, I greatly enjoyed this film. It is not mean to be overly serious or even overly silly. It is just a good family film that I can't wait to get on DVD.",1338681600,4,824,4.176100628930818
4763059,2,B005LAII0I,"This film has some really great moments, but they are sadly overshadowed by bad directing, bad casting, and bad writing.

The script involves the use of many modern idioms (i.e.,""Let's crash the party"").  There are also numerous tired Hollywood cliches.  The characters do the most unaccountably and uncharacteristically dumb things time after time.  It becomes difficult to suspend one's disbelief.

Many of the characters don't even have names.  They are simply ""The Prince,"" or ""The King.""

Half of the characters are played by English actors, and have English accents.  The other half are played by American actors, and have American accents.  I'm not sure where this story is set, but maybe Canada?  That's halfway between the US and England, isn't it?  At least culturally?

Julia Roberts was a particularly poor choice to play The Queen.  She does not do villainy well.

The film also makes some rather bold political statements, considering it is a fairy tale and a family film.  There are numerous references to the poor economic state of the kingdom and to the tendency for greater taxation to deepen the recession.  One character even makes a reference to ""tax dollars,"" which is a term that feels completely out of place in a medieval fantasy story.  While the film makes some good points regarding politics and economics, that really isn't what I was looking for in a fairy tale.

The film is full of beautiful costumes, sets, hair, makeup, and special effects, but they don't make up for the film's other shortcomings.  Children will probably still enjoy the film, but most adults will likely find it painful to endure.",1338422400,,1633,4.981481481481482
4763060,1,B005LAII0I,"This movie is supposed to be a new take on the Snow White story, which really was not that great of a story to begin with. It is told from the perspective of the queen in such a poor manner that you will be questioning why you went to see this movie to begin with. The humor in this movie is horrible. I kept expecting over zealous studio laughter to chime in to fill the awkward silence after something ""funny"" occurred.

Overall this movie is not worth the time of your life to watch. It is not even worth the time to read this review so do yourselves a favor and just stay away from another Hollywood re-hash of an old beaten down idea.",1338336000,5,639,4.153225806451613

Julia was pleasantly wicked, Lily sweet and determined, and Armie playing the prince and managing to be sweet, goofy, and manly, something that only a few actors over the years seem able to pull off. Brendan Fraser comes to mind. Stunning sets and costumes made it visually stunning. Put your feet up and enjoy. Not deep, but definitely pleasant.",1337126400,10,488,4.752941176470588
4763063,4,B005LAII0I,"Although not exactly a masterpiece, this film is a very pleasant, very amusing and very nice moment of cinema. It doesn't pretend to have other ambitions than to give us a merry good laugh - but in this mission it succeeds very nicely.

This is a very unorthodox retelling of the Snow White fairy tale, but the principal characters are all there.

The Evil Queen (Julia Roberts) is probably the main attraction in this show. She was ""modernized"" (she is in fact a gold digger exhausting financial resources of successive husbands) and ""upgraded"" (she can do REALLY BAD magic - it is not just disguise and poison). Her Magic Mirror is also much more powerful than earlier versions. Julia Roberts clearly had lots of fun playing this character and she is simply excellent! She is also very atractive in this film - frankly, I think even more attractive than Snow White... And the scene in which she takes care her of her body, face, skin, lips, hair etc. to better ensnare the Prince Charming is worth an Oscar!

Snow White (Lilly Collins) is of course also more ""modern"" than the one in Disney classical movie, but she is definitely not a modern teenager. She is brave, clever, funny and has much more ambition than just being rescued by the Prince Charming, but she is also a true lady: she is always impeccably dressed, never raises her voice, never curses, is always polite (even to the enemies) and although she can swordfight if necessary, she has also all the charm (and timidity) of a very young girl who was never allowed much out of her house... Last but not least, she is clearly a real future queen material - because with all her charm, manners and timidity she can also be ruthless, when necessary...

The Prince Charming (Armie Hammer) is a handsome young man, a little bit arrogant and conceited in the beginning, but also courageous, clever, resourceful and ultimately rather likeable. He can also quite well spank young ladies with his sword...)))

The Seven Dwarves are a very special bunch and I will not say much more about them, to avoid spoilers. But they certainly give a great show! After the end, just before the credits we learn what happened to them later - do NOT miss that part!

This film has a lot of easy and pleasant humour, with the results of magic used by the Evil Queen (magic is always a little unpredictable) and her comments on the developing story being the best moments. A good advice - never get changed into a cockroach. And if it happens, beware of grasshoppers...))) Also, before serving somebody a magic elixir, check well the notice...

Towards the end of the film Sean Bean drops by just in time to conclude the film and give away Snow White in marriage and he is a very impressive presence. And no, just for once, his character doesn't get killed in this one...)))

All in all, this is a very amusing, nice little film, watchable by all family, with two very beautiful women, one very handsome young man and seven very amusing unusually short freedom fighters! Enjoy!",1335744000,82,3016,4.656015037593985
4763064,5,B005LAII0I,I went and saw this movie with my brother and wasn't sure what to expect but I loved it! It is my favorite Snow White movie by far and I loved the soundtrack. I liked how the colors were vivid and the scenery was beautiful. Also how the story was funny and lighthearted. I would say what I enjoyed the most was that Snow White was just the right amount of heroine and damsel mixed together. She kicked butt while still maintaining her princess sweetness. I am looking forward to buying it as soon as it comes out.,1334707200,18,513,4.244897959183674
4763065,3,B005LAII0I,"There were a lot of interesting scenes and plot additions to the Snow White story and even the dialogue was entertaining, but when looking at the movie as a whole, it didn't feel like it belonged in the theater and rather felt like a Disney TV Special.

4763066,2,B005LAII0I,"Imagine the oldest fairy tale there is. Have you got it? No, not that one. Have you got it now? Yeah, that's it. Now ask yourself if it can be made into a movie, again? The brain trust at Relativity Media asked themselves that question and came back with a resounding yes.

  Snow White (played by Lily Collins) is the only child of a benevolent king, referred to only as The King (played by Sean Bean) and his late wife who, except for the detail that she died while giving birth to Snow (Collins), is not referred to at all. The King was raising Snow so that she might one day rule over the kingdom, but he was consumed by a beast known to inhabit the woods long before that could happen. With The King gone and Snow not yet ready to take the throne, the duty passed to his wife Clementianna (played by Julia Roberts). With her husband gone, Snow is the only threat to The Queen's rule, so she keeps her confined to the castle. When speaking to Snow, she claims it's for safety reasons, but when her subjects inquire about the matter, she makes it appear as though the princess they've never seen is in a fragile state as a result of either physical or mental illness. All the while, her excesses have seen a once happy, wealthy kingdom turned into a fiefdom in dire financial straits populated by overtaxed miserable subjects. Her closest advisor, Brighton (played as an obsequious toady by the talented Nathan Lane) informs her that her best hope is to marry a Baron who has made numerous overtures in the past. But while the Baron possesses the wealth she desires, he is older and not particularly attractive. Then, as luck and uncreative storytelling would have it, a prince from a wealthy, faraway kingdom (played by Armie Hammer) is robbed, bound, and gagged by bandits inhabiting the woods, freed by Snow White, who has left the castle without the Queen's permission, and then brought to the castle by the royal guard so that she might offer an apology and, of course, the King's vacant seat in the throne.

  Now, of course, there have been numerous successful films based on fairy tales. Tangled (based on Rapunzel), Beauty and the Beast, and the original Disney version of Cinderella in a film simply titled Cinderella. While the two older films may not have the same appeal with the youth audience that Tangled does, they have greater appeal with older audiences, not just because of nostalgia, but because they are quality films. So, if you're a parent and your children have been begging you to take them to this film, make whatever effort you can to convince them to watch the older classic film or the more recent Disney features based on other fairy tales. This one just doesn't hold up.",1334534400,,2705,4.590062111801243
