Creepy, hastily drawn people with freakishly small and twitchy eyes, ""King Herod""'s head changes proportions in each shot, sometimes big and bulbous, other times small and pointy. Characters mouths stop moving while they speak from time to time. And what about that scene with the wolf sneaking up on the sheep! The music sounds like Bernard Hermann's score for ""Psycho"", and when you see the Wolf's face, it's absolutely way too scary for young children. What a disturbing video!",1217808000,,642,4.845454545454546
