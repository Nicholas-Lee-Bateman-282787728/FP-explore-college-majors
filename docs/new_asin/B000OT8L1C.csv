8186588,5,B000OT8L1C,"The first thing to say is

1. Get this for the staging, sound and general direction which are superb. Plus Alan Held does a very good job in the lead role. A superb production from the Opera de Paris Bastille - a first class modern opera house.

2. Absolutely essential for singing par excellence and a near perfect realisation of the musical score the 1968 Cologne Radio broadcast conducted by Josef Keilberth issued originally on a handsome 2LP gatefold album and remastered for CD by DG. Fischer Dieskau (who sung the role in Munich in 1965) is at his full power here and the rest of the cast and involving nature of the recording will banish all memories of the DVD. Unfortunately, this CD in the ""20th Century Classics"" series lacks the libretto or translations. Aaaargh!

3. The Wergo CD boxset is to be avoided at all cost being a deadly dull working of the opera with lacklustre singing, poor direction and (for modern digital) strangely unsatisfactory sound. It doesn't get much worse than this.

4. Avoid the Opera d' Oro Cardillac CD with the dark cover - very poor sound and again no libretto.",1516233600,,1105,4.651282051282052
8186589,4,B000OT8L1C,"Seldom performed opera which I saw for the first time in this beatiful DVD. High marks for the principals especially Allan Held and the staging and sound from the Paris Opera crew!  Happy to see that the story derives from ETA Hoffman, one of my favorites.  Superb Hindemith!!",1386547200,4,276,4.729166666666667
8186590,5,B000OT8L1C,"There are two DVD's of this opera, which I did not previously know, but none of Hindemith's most performed work, ""Mathis der Mahler"".  On the basis of one review I decided on the Paris recording under Nagano, even though the other was staged by Ponelle. And my hunch proved right.  First class singing, acting and directing.  And to crown it all, a superb documentary that allows the listener/viewer insight into this absorbing tale of an artist who does not want ever to part with his creations--in his case, jewels-- and kills to get them back.  The very concept utterly perverts the logic of production and capitalism.  Utterly fascinating.",1351123200,7,643,4.916666666666667
8186591,5,B000OT8L1C,"This opera by Hindemith, based on an E.T.A. Hoffman story, has failed to capture much public interest since its Dresden premiere in 1926.  Perhaps this fine new Bel Air dvd can help remedy that.  The Paris Opera production is intelligently directed, well-sung and acted, nicely conducted by Kurt Nagano, and has a drop-dead gorgeous physical production that looks wonderful, glittering and detailed, in this beautiful transfer.  Anyone comfortable with Strauss or Korngold won't find this music difficult going -- much of it is ravishing -- and the psychology of the libretto's still intriguing.  The Bel Air release. while pricey, is preferable, both dramatically and musically, to the DG Ponnelle version.  Will repay investigation in spades.",1239840000,14,744,5.434782608695652
