2825754,3,B000PMLJMG,"by this movie being rated r, it was very corny! a complete waste of money at the movies! please people, wait for the dvd realease!",1174608000,2,130,4.24
2825755,2,B000PMLJMG,"""Dead Silence"" is a mostly jumpless, dreary little turdfiesta of a horror flick by James Whan & Leigh Whannell (the folks who brought us ""Saw""), and spends its time tediously tracking Puppets who Kill & the People who Love Them (which would be a great support group).

There are worse ways to kill 90 minutes than seeing ""Dead Silence"". It's not a bad flick. It shows some creepy, ghoulish promise here and there, some flashes---just flashes---of scary brilliance, and the opening 10 minutes pack more full-throated terror into them than a score of 2006's assault of PG-13 ""kiddie-friendly"" fear flicks ever could.

Indeed---from about the second the doomed Lisa Ashen (scream-queen newbie/vet Laura Regan, who looks like her dance card has just been punched one too many times)tosses a sheet over Billy the Dummy to the first few moments our hero Jamie (Ryan Kwanten, literally the man who wasn't there: as an actor, odorless, colorless, tasteless) goes spelunking into the Plot---well, for about 5 minutes I thought this thing was gonna creep & crawl.

Alas, no luck: there's some groping about in a root cellar that conjures up giddy memories of The Haunting of Julia (far finer ghostly fare), but after that it's pretty much the standard a) big floaty skull-headed dead woman shows up, flaps & vamps around; b) victim cringes and wheedles c) victim gets tongue torn out and dies; d) Donnie Wahlberg shows up in a dubious moustache & Columbo's raincoat.

Rinse, repeat, stretch into a feature film. There's a lot of talky talky talky, which just goes to show that movie producers still don't get it when horror fans say IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SLAUGHTER, STUPID! We don't need backstory. This isn't ""Wuthering Heights"". Bring on the buckets of blood, already.

Anyway, despite a few spooky bits, this is about as good as last year's movie about killer videogames, I forget the name. Indeed, the vibe and the effects are pretty much the same, along with the acting. But from Whannel & Wan, I expected better---and you should too. Why even have 101 Killer Puppets if you're going to do nothing with 'em?

Things I observed while watching ""Dead Silence"":

1) Puppets who Kill can get away with murder for a while, but only up to a point. After all, how hard is it to spot a 2-foot-tall assassin with a wooden jaw and a stick up his bungus?

2) The Killer Puppets are great at slaughtering entire families with impunity & unleashing jihad on trained police detectives, but not so hot at doing basic Survival 101 moves---like hopping out of burning display cases.

3) Donnie Wahlberg is contractually obligated to look seedier & at least 10 years older with every passing film he does.

4) Blythe Danner has great horror chops! Blythe is in this flick as the crazy woman who spends time petting a stuffed raven (a great prop!). No kidding. Or maybe it's her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, I can't tell 'em apart nowadays. They both look like skeletons with a little layer of puffy white dough kneaded across their skullheads.

5) If I were to bio-genetically vat-grow a woman of my own, it would turn out looking like Amber Valleta. She can work my puppet-handle any day (lucky, lucky, lucky Bob Gunton).

6) Horror movie Scream Queens really have a short shelf life. You disagree? Consider young Laura Regan, who coulda been a contendah, but has instead bounced from one B-movie to another (""They"", ""Hollowman 2"", and now this). She's toast. I couldn't figure out which was the scarier sight, the killer puppet Billy or Regan's slabs of pancake makeup. Yechhh.

7) You know what I *do* think ""Dead Silence"" proves? It proves ""Saw"" was a fluke. A happy accident.

Oh, and the last line of the movie is great: ""So who's the Dummy now?""

A truer, and more cruelly ironic, movie kiss-off line was never uttered, and the answer is clear to anyone who sits through this stinker:

We are.

2825757,4,B000PMLJMG,"One day, Jamie (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife find a box with no return address on their doorstep: It contains a ventriloquist dummy. When Jamie goes to buy takeout that night, he comes back to find his wife's been murdered and her tongue's been cut out. He becomes the number one suspect in Detective Lipton's (Donnie Wahlberg) investigation. Upon returning to his hometown of Raven's Fair to bury her, he begins to think that there might be more behind his wife's murder than he first thought. The old poem about Mary Shaw and her 101 dolls to scare the kids might have been true after all. He starts digging and soon finds out a lot of nasty things about Raven's Fair.

From James Wan and Leigh Whannell, co writers of the Saw films comes a creepy killer doll movie. James Wan, who's directing his second film (he only directed the first Saw film), masterfully directs this very atmospheric film; the fog, eerie lighting, zoom outs, and gloomy score by Charlie Clouser (also a Saw veteran) all contribute in making this film an above average horror film. You can tell that this project was done by true horror fans that are passionate about their craft. Don't expect a Saw-type film; this isn't a torture, gore and guts kind of movie, more of a sinister ghost story and it works on most levels.

The film had the touch of classic fifties and eighties horror films which I think it paid great homage to. If you've been missing good old-fashioned horror flicks without all that ultra violence, this movie's for you. Kwanten is very believable as the protagonist. Wahlberg, whose screen time is minimal, steals the scene every shot he gets. The supporting cast is filled with familiar faces and does a good job as well. The special effects were nicely done and the doll designs oozed creepiness to boot. There were a few reactions from the characters that made me wince; Lisa goes back to the bedroom after everything stops and goes dead quiet (Dead Silence, get it?) when she should have been running out of there, also, after Jamie's done burying the doll and he sees shadows moving around his car, no one in their right mind would've opened their door to check what it was (but that's what characters did in eighties horror movies). The finale had a good build-up and in true Whannell-Wan fashion, yes, there's a cool twist-ending. Make sure to pay attention to the pan of the camera during the confrontation near the end, you'll be able to spot a cameo from a character from the Saw films (kind of like Where's Waldo).

If you're part of the new kids who dig their horror movies with buckets of blood, lots of gruesome torture scenes and plenty of violence, then this might not be the film for you. Although, if you're a fan of those old killer doll movies a la Dolls (1987), Puppet Master (1989) and Child's Play (1988), then you'll really dig Dead Silence.",1174089600,49,2859,4.624015748031496
2825758,3,B000PMLJMG,"This movie, from the guys who brought us the SAW trilogy, is going to disappoint anyone who is expecting that sort of gore, torture and griminess.  Okay, it is grimy, but it is not gory.  Despite an R rating, it's a fairly tame CREEPY supernatural story.  It feels very old school, almost like an episode of NIGHT GALLERY.

The creepy ventriloquist's doll Billy, who actually does almost nothing in the movie...is the STAR.  Just sitting there, lovingly photographed in shadow...he'll make the hairs on your neck stand up.  We respond to him in an illogical way, but it can't be helped.  Those dummies are just a little weird.

The story of DEAD SILENCE is not terribly original, but it does stay true to the expectations of the form.  It also has a decent surprise ending that you'll probably see coming...but only a few minutes before our ""hero"" does.  My wife, 14 year old daughter and I were all quite satisfied.  This is a genre film that for a change of pace, actually delivers some solid chills...unlike THE MESSENGERS, DARK WATER, etc. etc.

It does have some problems, though.  Namely Ryan Kwantan, the lead actor in the film who is such a dreadful actor I felt actually angry at him for ruining the film.  Totally incapable of any display of convincing emotion.  Just the pits.  And Donnie Wahlberg mostly looks bored by his character...a cop who is the worst law-enforcement officer ever and apparently works for a police force that consists of just him.  The film is low-budget, but some decent CGI work saves it.  But the poor casting really shows the low-budget seams.

It's an okay film that could have been more.",1174089600,17,1628,4.709219858156028
2825759,3,B000PMLJMG,"If your expecting another SAW type film that these guys have made in the past, you will be bored to tears. It is fairly slow moving and very little gore. The visuals are nice, but the acting is decent at best. I actually think the twist ending made Dead Silence a better film, even though it wasn't that mind blowing. If I could go back in time I would wait for this one to come out on DVD.

2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1174089600,,416,3.8941176470588235
2825760,4,B000PMLJMG,"Halfway through ""Dead Silence,"" I came to the conclusion that it was enjoyable because it can't be taken seriously. This is a wonderfully atmospheric horror film with a laughably preposterous story, so much so that it's actually a lot of fun to watch. Anyone who says that this film is bad is absolutely right. And no wonder; it was written by Leigh Whannell and directed by James Wan, the same men responsible for 2004's highly effective but equally preposterous ""Saw."" For this new film, they utilize all the best horror movie methods imaginable, from minimal lighting to unnerving close-ups to foggy, overgrown cemeteries. They've also crafted a plot without any degree of plausibility, especially when it comes to the obligatory twist ending; to say that the final revelation is overwhelmingly unrealistic would be an understatement. To say that it still succeeds in being shocking wouldn't be surprising.

Can such a film be given any credit? Yes, but not in the way you might think; I have a strong feeling that the story was supposed to be ridiculous, if not for the sake of simplicity, then for the sake of making the disturbing visuals and pop out scares more effective. At the very least, this film actually has a story, which is more than I can say for hopeless fright fests like ""The Abandoned."" Made in the tradition of films like ""Child's Play"" and ""Puppet Master,"" ""Dead Silence"" is a ghost story that takes a beloved child-friendly activity--ventriloquism--and turns it into a horrific spectacle. Dummies have never been as frightening as they are in this film, with their smooth, pale skins and their large, unhinged jaws and their big, glassy eyes that seem to stare directly into the audience.

It begins when Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan), receive a mysterious package. They open it to find a ventriloquist dummy crafted into a boy. The thing is damn creepy, to say the least, but it seems to have no effect on Lisa, who plays with it, talks to it, and even props it upright on her bed. Only when Jamie goes to pick up dinner does she discover the dummy's true nature, and by then, it's too late for her. First, a majority of the ambient noises go silent: a record player spins slower and slower until it stops; a whistling teakettle is muted, even as steam spews from the spout; a ticking clock goes quiet. All she can hear is her own breathing. That, and bizarre laughter coming from the bedroom.

When Jamie returns, he finds his beloved wife propped up in bed, her mouth opened unnaturally wide and her tongue forcefully ripped out. Thus begins Jamie's nightmare, made worse by the fact that he's the prime suspect in his wife's murder. Assigned to his case is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), a man who, for whatever reason, compulsively uses an electric shaver. He was so condescending that I just wanted to smack him upside the head; he speaks down to Jamie, showing him the same respect a bratty child would be shown. I suppose I shouldn't complain; every horror movie of this sort requires the annoying, intrusive side character, mostly because the audience takes pleasure in seeing him or her die at some point (whether or not Lipton dies, I'll leave for you to discover).

Against Lipton's orders, Jamie returns to his ailing hometown of Raven's Fair for Lisa's funeral. He takes the mysterious dummy with him, apparently in order to ""get some answers"" (which translates as, ""only for the sake of plot advancement""). This is because he remembers a nursery rhyme he used to be told as a child: ""Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. / She had no children, only dolls. / And if you see her in your dream, / Be sure to never, ever scream."" The legend of Mary Shaw--an early twentieth century ventriloquist (Judith Roberts)--is no longer spoken of in Raven's Fair, according to Henry Walker (Michael Fairman) the town's aging mortician.

Let's examine this legend. In the early 1940s, a local boy had gone missing. Because this boy had publicly humiliated Shaw during one of her shows (""I can see your lips moving!"" he shouts), the town immediately suspected that she had something to do with his disappearance. This prompts a group of vigilantes to take justice into their own hands, first by cutting out Shaw's tongue, second by murdering her. But nothing stays buried forever (literally); over the years, many people have been savagely murdered, each victim having his or her tongue ripped out. It would seem that, through her dummies, the ghost of Mary Shaw is ""silencing"" the families of those who murdered her.

But how does this all connect with Jamie? He first turns to his father, Edward (Bob Gunton), for information, but he quickly sees that it's useless. For one thing, they haven't gotten along in years. For another thing, he's now wheelchair bound from a stroke, completely dependent on the care of his third wife, the sickeningly sweet Ella (Amber Valletta). It seems that Jamie's only resource is Henry; not only did he attend one of Shaw's shows as a boy, he also had an interesting encounter with her body as she was being prepped for burial. One would expect nothing less from this kind of film, especially since her final wish was to be transformed into a dummy. Can you imagine a human head with slits on both sides of the mouth and bulgy glass eyes?

It was also her wish that each of her hundred or so dummies be buried. But they didn't stay buried for long, as Jamie and Lipton discover during the climactic sequence in Shaw's dilapidated theater. They also discover a book of sketches, specifically instructions on constructing handmade dummies. Attached is a flap of paper with the words ""How to Build the Perfect Dummy"" written on it. I won't say what it's in reference to, but I will say that it paves the way for the aforementioned twist ending, a moment that was both frightening and silly. Pretty much all of ""Dead Silence"" can be described the same way, which I believe was intentional on the filmmaker's part. It's horrifying to see a dummy turning to gaze at someone, especially when no one is operating it. Likewise, it's funny to hear lines like, ""There are things you remember, and then there are things you never forget."" Now that's truly the work of a gifted screenwriter.

Yes, ""Dead Silence"" is a bad movie, but like many classic horror films, it's so bad that it's good. It's everything a story about possessed dummies should be, and no more. Whether or not this makes it worth recommending is open for debate; I'm giving it four stars because I had fun watching it, and because it succeeds in creating the right horror movie atmosphere. For some of you, this will not be enough, and that's certainly understandable; you have my permission to dismiss this movie and go in search of something more meaningful.",1174003200,,6808,4.758679085520745

There are clear flaws everywhere, but there's just some redeeming qualities that make you overlook all those crummy bits.

Jaime and Lisa Ashen, receive a mysterious box. Inside, they find a ventriloquist doll. Jaime goes out to get supper and when he returns, he finds Lisa dead - with her tongue cut out. Jaime finds the doll suspicious. He tears open the padding inside the mysterious box and he sees the name ""Mary Shaw"", a ventriloquist from his home town.

He goes to Raven's Fair to investigate Mary Shaw but no one speaks of her. He goes to his father's (Edwards) house and his father is now in a wheelchair and he has a new bride, Ella.

2825833,1,B000PMLJMG,"jump scars, but so predictable.  I wish to state something here, which I doubt anyone really reads, but I feel like stating it nonetheless, new horror movies suck.  Young people, wow, I really said that, young people brag about not being scared by movies, and they are right.  They judge movies by how many jump scares it has in it instead of the quality of the mysterious.  And that is what horror movies are missing, the mysterious.  You can find gore, grossness, lots of evil, and spiritual/religious fears and philosophies, but there is no human-ness to it.  The new movies feel like they are built on recipe's from a new cookbook made by a celebrity who hires a private chef to do her or his cooking.  They suck.  I think the last few good ones I saw were Ninth Gate/Sleepy Hallow, and When a Stranger Calls (2006).  I'm not counting Urban Legends and the Scream movies.  They are awesome but cheeky, you know its staged in a way in those movies.  Contradictorally,  I'm kind of glad horror movies nowadays suck so much.  I really don't want to be scared much currently, not in real life, I have too much of that right now.  Maybe one day I can take it again, but right now, I won't even have to worry about seeing it in any movies anytime soon.  Lastly, my nephew and I worked on why young people like him are not scared of movies anymore.  He and I finally came to the conclusion that they are desensitized to it, and easily understand and tell themselves that its all fake.  They don't put themselves into the charactor who is running away or suffering, and though some times the bad guy dies, they do often like to subconsciously see themselves in the more powerful person there, often the bad guy.  And even if not, they lack empathy for the charactors all around.  Is it natural selective Autistic-like geneticly driven changes in our young people who have to quickly adapt to a more technological world of math and science focusing more on the less empathic left brain?  Probably.  Couple that with a society focused on overly sexuallizing children which promotes using each other as pleasure tools instead of forming emotional attachments with deep rooted bonds, and you have a more robotic, less empathic populous.  Besides, the newer movies rarely have any charactors that you can feel good about having empathy for.  When a movie recipe calls for a jump scare every ten minutes, we have to realize that artistic quality is not their number one concern.  Thanks for taking the time to read over this.  Good luck finding something good out there.",1468108800,,2560,4.635555555555555

2825883,4,B000PMLJMG,"Maybe I was just in a good mood, but I liked this movie for its feel of being a throwback to the classic 1980's horror movies I grew up with. It's not flat-out funny like a Motel Hell, and it's not a masterpiece like The Shining. Think of movies like the original Child's Play, Christine, and Pet Sematary. It has that kind of blend of cheesy and creepy and winds up being fun. It avoids a lot of conceits that have become so dreadfully common that they bog down contemporary horror films, such as being overly self-aware and meta, too spoofy, too trapped in realism, too reliant on gore, or worst of all, found-footage. The film does have a bit of gore, but it doesn't revel in it and it's used effectively. There is a twist at the end, but the whole film does not pin its success to a single twist.

There is no gore but apparently you don't need gore to make a really good and genuinly frightening film.

2825955,5,B000PMLJMG,"Genuinely terrifying and suspenseful.

This movie is what you call a slow burn horror movie as in it takes its time and builds up the tension before it scares the crap out of you.

The story behind the character of Mary Shaw is disturbing and creepy too say the least.

I found the tiny traces of humor refreshing as well.

Donnie Wahlberg was hilarious .

The rest of the actors I felt did a great job especially the actress who played the creepy ventriloquist Mary .

I also liked how back then the trailers on tv were much more inviting and actually drew you in.

I remember the first time I saw a tv spot for this film I was instantly drawn in and thought omg this actually looks good.

I have this movie on dvd and have seen it about 4 times now including on a movie channel I taped it on last year.

One of the main draws for me was the main character gorgeous guy and great actor he was also on the tv show True Blood.

I give it 5 stars the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife the incredibly creepy ventriloquist and an unbelievably sick ending you won't see coming makes this the perfect horror film.

Watch one specific part involving a child a morgue and a dead body that ...gets up and see what I mean by true terror.

This movie really preyed upon the fears that children have when they are young including the alone at night in the darkness terror so many of us had as children.",1420675200,,1403,4.174721189591078

2826011,4,B000PMLJMG,"Dead Silence is good old fashioned horror entertainment, done right. Helped by a sense of style and great imagery, it's slim story works well enough and the movie does provide some good scares

So, to the plot - a creepy ventriloquists dummy is delivered anonymously to the door of a young couple. Naturally this precipitates something supernatural, ending in violence. The hero of the tale is the husband, who recognises the dummy and takes it with him on a trip to his childhood home which is now a ruined ghost town only inhabited by a few crazy folk. The rest of the story is spent unravelling the history of the town and why the dummy brings death to the people who come into contact with it.

The story is not complex but it's a good one, and it holds your interest. What supports it is the great look of the movie, with some spectacular sets and locations including several elaborate buildings. There's atmosphere in abundance, and the film is littered with lots of clever touches, like scenes changing from maps into real roads, or dissolves from drawings into flashbacks, plenty of fluid camerawork  and unusual angles. Too much of this could have got gimmicky, but it's kept in check just enough. If anything it's the shots of the creepy dummy that start to get boring, as there are only so many times that slowly swivelling eyeballs are going to give you goosebumps

The acting is so-so, the film certainly does not live or die by the performances, but they are all fairly good. There are some gory scenes, and there is a pretty good twist at the end too. Because of the great camera work and sense of style the movie looks pretty classy. I can forgive a few plot-holes when I am being entertained, and ""Dead Silence' is certainly a lot of fun",1407456000,,1754,4.576433121019108

2826014,5,B000PMLJMG,"When the trailer proudly announced ""From the creators of SAW"" I thought for sure we were in for torture and gore. But they've done something completely unique with DEAD SILENCE and instead let our imaginations do the scaring. The movie relies on that instinctual fear and discomfort ventriloquist dolls bring out in most. It takes you back to camp fire stories and small town tales. DEAD SILENCE uses zoomed out shots, intense silence, and a very creepy doll to make your hair stand on end. Reminiscent of old school horror movies, the movie is fairly simple and effective. I was impressed. If you like your horror simple, creepy, and full of killer dolls, DEAD SILENCE is worth the watch.",1407110400,,689,4.798319327731092

Why are there always metal handled kettles in films with rocket hot handles? We know Billy's a creepy doll, why not burn him in the beginning? Didn't Dad smell given all the roaring fireplaces he's parked in front of? Who can drive and read a map that sits on the passenger seat? How can all these people die and there are no cops working on ongoing serial murders? Why is only one detective on the case and why is the prime suspect allowed to leave town? Why is there a nutty old bat, who talks to a stuffed crow at the funeral home? She's obviously a few planks shy, but her husband doesn't secure the basement doors so she can't get down there?

Instead of hating the women and her dolls i felt sorry for her and her doll children. the spin off isn't as big of a surprise at the end. The actors suck including the cop character. There was no effort from any one except Judith Roberts. It was a sort of cheap horror movie that was created in an hour.

By the ending, which was a bit of a surprise, I just didn't care anymore. It didn't even strike me as a very atmospheric or creepy thriller...just one that lacked a quality script.

She's quite popular with her renegade friends and even has quite the weird doll collection herself with chucky Tiffany and the Toulan Puppets As the crown jewels....all the originals...and the latest Dr. Death...a new monster high doll who's a vampire we call Jesters wife and my Dracula daughter doll(again sorry the computer won't let me say her name but we like to call her Leech Woman) and a lot of vampire dolls. And I was looking up Puppet Master fun to celebrate our latest (that would be Dr. Death and Leech Woman) add ins to my collection when a trailer for Dead Silence comes up. Now I'll admit the movie could've been a lot better....but the doll collection was just SO COOL! And The Ghost Story loved it...and I thought this when I was 20 and 1st saw the movie on DVD and still think so now; even though I don't have the movie but I do have the doll collection...Mary Shaw could be like Freddys wife(you're talking to a real Wes Craven fan here; but if you've been reading my reviews you'd know why (but I still got to make my cool comparison. Freddy was burned in his house by the parents of the teens later in Springwood ( now also for fans who don't know this Buffys address in Sunnydale of 1630 Revello Drive is exact to Nancy's in Springwood Sunnydale isn't just The HELLMOUTH I linked this up last year when watching Nightmare on Elm Street movies on tv (but hey I'm also The Scream Queen!) And Mary Shaw has a similar ghost story (and I'll tell you that part in a minute) of being The town's best ventriloquist (but the dolls were her children. A boy was killed, she was the only suspect and was burned in her own house. Now she went thru dreams taking out the tongues of the families in every generation who did this 2 her. SEE her and Freddy were made for each other. I think they could've combined that somehow. I also loved the fact that her spirit was living in the dolls in the end and they had to destroy them to stop it. The only problem I have with this (and its not the whole cast just a few cause again I'm going to say this but it's true Corey Feldman would've been So much better as the lead guy...this other one who I don't even know his name (or care thank you very much) was just dull, and I was glad his girlfriend was killed at the beginning cause she was just as dull. I liked the cop though (surprising cause usually in movies these are the 1st I hate!) I liked the old man who's telling the story, I thought Mary Shaw was quite a good actress and I liked the ghosts. Oh and here's a funny thing I didn't like...but it starts out with something I did like. I liked how the dolls were buried in those little puppet master puppet sized coffins...but they say there's 100 of them, and you see them later in those glass cabinets and you're like; oh there are So many more then just 10O!

2826176,4,B000PMLJMG,"Something evil has been haunting the town of Ravens Fair. For over the last sixty years, townspeople have been found brutally murdered with a straight razor and their tongues torn out. Now, the widowed husband of the latest victim has come home determined to unravel the town's deadly secret and put an end to the terror once and for all.

  While it won't win any Academy Awards, Dead Silence is much better then what critics and some of the negative reviewers give it credit for. At its heart, its a ghost story albeit a very gory one. Ryan Kwantan, before he went on to HBO's mega successful True Blood, gives a really good performance as the grief stricken widower Jamie Asher.  Both Amber Valleta and Donnie Whalberg also do well in their roles though Donnie's Dt. Lipton's constant use of his electric razor grated my nerves.

  It is obvious that Dead Silence borrows elements from Magic, I also see a lot of Darkness Falls in it as well. Both movies' antagonists are the ghosts of elderly women who become scapegoats to their towns' rage and mob mentality. But where Matilda Dixon was entirely innocent and unjustifiedly murdered thus giving her revenge a just cause, here Mary Shaw was anything but innocent.  She murdered a small boy for not believing in her talent so she got what she deserved.

  The movie opened and was a box office bomb but it seems that it has finally found it's audience on DVD. My guess is that this movie will, in about ten years, become a horror classic. All the elements are there and it's popularity is on the rise.  The body count is low but there is more tension and suspense here than in all the Saws and Hostel movies combined which is ironic since this movie was made by the same two guys that made the first Saw.  I rarely watch movies more than once but this movie I have already seen three times since my first initial viewing and can find many elements that I missed with each showing.  Definatly worth a watch preferably on a dark and stormy night.",1341187200,4,1997,4.5264623955431755
2826177,2,B000PMLJMG,"This is solely a technical problem with the DVD of the unrated widescreen edition--I loved the film.

One of the things that struck me initially on viewing this movie was the attention paid to the saturated hues--mostly blue but I remember some green in there as well as a very rich red for Jamie's car, Billy's bowtie and the curtains at the theatre, along with some sepia and finally DE-saturation for Henry's tale about Mary Shaw's performance and her unusual final request in the past.

If you purchase the unrated version of the movie, they've stupidly tried to re-color correct and as a result it looks super washed out and *beep*, with no true blacks in the darker parts of the frame either. The special effects look horrible because of this. It's one of the brightest, least contrasty horror films I've ever seen on DVD. You shouldn't have to adjust the contrast and brightness levels on your television for the film to be watchable, sorry.

Even more frustrating is that during the 'making of' featurette, James Wan and the cinematographer talk about how important the color and rich blacks were for their vision of the film as being an homage to older horror movies.

I think I was one of the smaller group of people who actually enjoyed this movie, flaws and all. So I was pretty annoyed to see what they'd done with the DVD transfer. Maybe the blu-ray is better but somehow I doubt it.

2826182,3,B000PMLJMG,"Let's just get this out there now: I'm a big fan of James Wan and Leigh Whannell. I jumped on the bandwagon (late) with Saw and I've followed them ever since. I've even enjoyed the sequels to Saw. I watched Dead Silence in theaters when it first came out, which I rarely do for films I don't really care about. So I'm a little biased to their movies in the fact that I always like the stylized violence, the frenzied recap, and the wicked twists that Wan throws upon the viewer before he ends the film.

But I must be factual here and say that for all of the interesting plot that Dead Silence has, its script is rather poor. A ghost story is one thing, but to literally have an old woman roaming around with seven tongues in her mouth is just a tad bit overkill, don't you think? This can easily be compared to the recent Insidious, which had a very strong premise and a good classic ghost story at its heart; then, it ceased its originality in a display of a monster which was much cornier than it was scary. The same is true of Dead Silence, with an old woman who lost her tongue and her life to a band of murderers. She now comes back to collect the lineage's tongues, as though that is somehow revenge for past sins.

In essence, Dead Silence is very similar to A Nightmare on Elm Street. A vengeful spirit seeks out uninvolved parties to murder, and she takes their life if they scream. Jamie (Ryan Kwanten) is sucked into the whole thing by receiving a ventriloquist dummy in the mail, who proceeds to kill his wife in a grisly stabbing before ripping out her tongue and opening her mouth up wide (insert a number of inappropriate jokes about large mouths and/or the benefits of no tongue). The woman was a ventriloquist obsessed with her dolls, which appeared to have life or at least the souls of victims. She worked on creating the perfect doll, which would be a human that can be controlled, and then she set about doing so with a child from town. Now her spirit haunts all of the family members.

The darkness of the movie is foreboding, and Dead Silence works better without sound than with the stings of violin chords when the sound fades from the room. The tension of walking up to a shrouded figure is more effective when there's nothing to signal the scare, and Wan uses that to his advantage in a number of situations where dummies or the ventriloquist woman pop out of thin air. Unfortunately, however, there's nothing deeper than that in the scares - just a mounting amount of tension until a quick jolt makes the viewer jump and then settle back into the groove.

Donnie Wahlberg's character Detective Lipton is seriously underused here, which is a shame because Whannell and Wan put a lot of effort into fleshing him out with subtle character traits like his constant shaving. It's a bit disappointing, because Wahlberg's aloof persona is much more entertaining than Kwanten's dour seriousness; despite the loss of his wife, I just didn't really believe it, especially considering the fact that he makes a lot of strange choices when trying to uncover the truth of Mary Shaw.

There's also the problem of the twist ending, which, I'll admit, caught me off-guard when I first saw the film. It's an ingenious device at first, and the film does make good on it throughout the entire film, albeit a bit sneakily. But when one stops to really think about why the twist is important, it all falls apart. Why did Mary Shaw need a human doll to do her dirty work? She's killed many men before Jamie, and it appears that she's quite unstoppable even without her dolls to help her. What makes Jamie scream at the end - the fact that he no longer has a stepmilf, but a doll? The conclusion is surprising and also unnecessary, although I'm not sure I can think of a better ending for the film.

Slash to the Point: Just like a ventriloquist show, Dead Silence is fun but also a bit old hat. Its supernatural storyline has been done to death, and its scares are little more than ""boo"" scares that become predictable as the film progresses. But there are a few surprises in the film, and more than a couple creepy opening scenes to pull your strings. Unfortunately, though, the film often falls into ruts; to complete the pun, we can see the lips moving.",1318464000,3,4262,4.492903225806452
2826183,5,B000PMLJMG,"In many ways this movie resembled a horror first person video game. The surrealistic visuals  especially the exteriors), blue-lit, soft focus foggy shots, overly-dramatic score - it all adds to the atmosphere. There are plenty of hints as to the ending and big reveal. The ending was kind of a letdown. It really seems as if the writers ran out of steam and went for the obvious.  Apart from that, this is a great movie for horror films.  It relies more on atmosphere and suspense than gory effects (apart from the occasional mutilated corpse, and even those are PG.)

Any horror fan should see it once. You really will like it.  I usually hate ""doll"" or ""ventriloquist dummy"" flicks.  But this one really stands out.",1316908800,8,717,4.696
2826204,4,B000PMLJMG,"""Dead Silence"" is the kind of horror film you have to watch a few times before you can understand the plot and before you can say you liked it. Upon first viewing I couldn't distinguish what the heck was going on, why certain characters were doing what they were doing, and what the villin's main purpose was. After my second viewing I started to understand the plot a lot more and I became interested. I can't say ""Dead Silence"" is my favorite thriller or even on my Top 10 list of scary films, but it's an OK movie.

 The plot basically deals with dolls, one in particular named Billy, who kills a guy's wife when he finds the doll outside their apartment. He eventually goes to bury his wife in a small town and brings the doll with him to understand its origins. The doll was part of a 1940's act called ""Mary Shaw and Billy"". Mary was a ventriloquist who collected 101 dolls and upon her death she basically became some sort of ghost that led Billy to killing people.

 The actress playing Mary Shaw, Judith Roberts, gave me the absolute chills. A woman of at least 75 her voice is creepy and her body movements unsettling so she is a nice asset to an otherwise medicore movie.

 ""Dead Silence"" was written and produced by the same team who made the ""Saw"" franchise, but this film was by no means a hit. Most critics and fans hated it and the movie only grossed $22,000,000 on a $20,000,000 budget.",1316131200,3,1403,4.397683397683398

2826206,4,B000PMLJMG,"I am not a big fan of the malevolent doll subgenre in horror, but respecting talents of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, I gave Dead Silence (2007) a try.  While this film didn't change my feelings about dolls, puppets, or dummies, this was an entertaining and atmospheric tale, with a wicked twist at the conclusion.  Wan and Whannell, creators of the Saw series, turned that project over to others, so they could work on Dead Silence.  Characterized by some as a throwback to a gothic style of storytelling, perhaps this was not the time for resurgence in puppet horror, as the film tanked at the box office.  Despite there being no Sawesque gore, I still recommend the film to those who appreciate their PG-13 horror with a little ghostly element.

Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife Lisa (Laura Regan) receive a strange looking ventriloquist puppet as a gift.  While Jamie is out of the house, Lisa is mysteriously killed, her tongue removed, and her body left looking like a grotesque doll.  Police Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg) suspects Jamie of being involved, but has no proof.  Jamie returns to his home town of Ravens Fair, to bury his wife.  He also visits his estranged father Edward (Bob Gunton), and discovers that he has remarried, and suffered a stroke.  Now confined to a wheelchair, his needs are attended to by his wife Ella (Amber Valletta).

Jamie eventually learns about Mary Shaw, a famous ventriloquist, who during a performance, was heckled by a small boy named Michael Ashen.  Shortly thereafter, Michael mysteriously disappeared.  The Ashen family, and others in the town, cut out Mary Shaw's tongue before killing her.  As time passed, Mary began to exact her revenge, as the people responsible began to die, their bodies found with their tongues cut out.  Now Ravens Fair has practically become a ghost town.  With Lisa's death the last in a long line of similar killings, Jamie may be the next on the list.

The family curse is a device with a long tradition in horror, and the setup here is rather traditional, with the innocent hero poking around and then discovering its existence.  The ghostly Mary Shaw is creepy, but with her major weapon being her huge grotesque tongue, what she can do is rather limited.  Dead Silence heavily relies on darkness and a heavy atmosphere, to setup the scares, as it's a little short on action and gore.  The acting performances are generally solid.  Ryan Kwanten is understated and effective, as his character uncovers the truth in a calm and rational way.  Detective Lipton is guy who just has a lot of time on his hands, leaving his jurisdiction to pursue what is a nebulous case.  Bob Gunton, Amber Valetta, and Michael Fairman as the mortician, don't have much screen time, but are all quite effective in crucial roles.

For their most personal projects, Leigh Whannell and James Wan and have steered away from the gory extremes that the Saw films have inspired.  Dead Silence is a creepy atmospheric ghost story that provides some thrills, while building up to a climactic finish.  The film's big twist plays out pretty well, as Mary Shaw accomplishes her goal of creating the perfect dummy.  The plot has some holes, but is generally well crafted, and effectively creates a creepy atmosphere, however a little more action might have helped perk it up a bit.  Rating 3.5 stars, this one is a bit of a tweener.",1313539200,,3394,4.805172413793104
2826207,3,B000PMLJMG,"Although the story and characters aren't impressive, the look and style worked very nicely here. Wonderful atmosphere, as far as I'm concerned. (But that doesn't make a great horror film, as ""Silent Hill"" proves.)

""Dead Silence"" is virtually packed with the trappings that I really enjoy in horror movies. There's a fog-swirled cemetery, creepy dolls, a vengeful ghostie, and more. This movie had more spooky settings than ten other horror films; you've not only got the dilapidated remnants of a grand old vaudeville theater on a misty lake near an abandoned quarry ... but you've also got a cavernous Victorian estate straight out of ""The Haunting of Hill House"" or ""Dark Shadows"", as well as a dark and sinister crawlspace beneath a funeral home. Visually, this was all very pleasing to the eyes.

I read that movie bombed at the box office, and critics were fairly merciless in pointing out its bland characters and blatant twist. The story was fair (we've seen this before), but definitely predictable in some ways-- in fact, the film ends with a cool twist that you can see coming from the first act, but it is very effective nonetheless.

""Dead Silence"" has the feel of an old fashioned horror film in the vein of Vincent Price's Poe movies, Hammer Films, or even William Castle. It wasn't terrific but it was definitely entertaining. It is not gory although it features what I'd call some gruesome imagery (which I thoroughly enjoyed).

The movie is filmed in some sort of soft blue wash, either via filter or done in post production. This actually makes the color red, which is used carefully and prominently, all the more vivid and noticeable. Also, the ominous phantom of silver-haired ventriloquist Mary Shaw was a delightful creation to me. I've seen witchy ghosts before in movies (haven't we all, from ""Darkness Falls"" to a dozen other flicks), and this one was impressive and memorable. Great makeup effects, costume, and a gleeful performance by the striking actress Judith Roberts (who was cast during auditions in Manhattan after the studio just couldn't find the right type in Los Angeles).

This is one of those movies that often gets mixed reviews from viewers. I liked it. I wasn't blown away by it. And it's such an interesting departure from ""Saw"", as if that movie's creators decided to go a very different road entirely, and switch gears to a more retro flavor and look and tale. I prefer supernatural horror, so this appealed to me.

2826211,2,B000PMLJMG,"DEAD SILENCE is an entertaining but frustrating film. It offers an initially interesting variation on the 1945 English film DEAD OF NIGHTs story about a crazed ventriloquist, brilliantly played by Michael Redgrave. Making a ventriloquist dummy scary isn't hard. Those blasted dolls are frightening by themselves. So the filmmakers job is partially done from the get go. However, keeping an audience guessing and intrigued is where director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell drop the ball.

The first scene when a young husband and wife mysteriously receive a dummy at their doorstep is interesting. The young couple seem like a real couple. The lighting and color are subtle and muted, almost nostalgic looking. The movie is beautifully shot by lensman John R. Leonetti. So far so good. However, once tragidy strikes out and the husband returns to his dying home town, one stupid plot device after another one hamper the fun.

Ryan Kwanten is a very appealing actor. His natural screen charisma goes a long way to keeping what interest the film has. He generates empathy even when the plot devices almost make you stop caring. His character is made to do one stupid thing after another, like letting an out of line police detective bully him without seeing a lawyer, keeping the obviously dangerous doll within striking distance to him, and going to haunted,unsafe buildings alone in the dark, knowing a supernatural force is out to get him. Yeah, it's only a movie, but when characters behave so irrationally you see the scriptwriter typing, rather than get carried away by the scene.

Another plus is Judith Roberts as the witchy, seductive ventriloquist. She has a screen presence that haunts, and her husky voice is unforgetable. You want more of her on screen, and less of the digital special effects using her her beautiful, mature face.

Although you can salute the filmmakers for trying to do a good, old fashioned atmospheric ghost story without excess gore, more thought should have been put in to how the characters would interact with each other. DEAD SILENCE is worth seeing for the premise and production, but don't expect a classic, or even for it to make much sense. 1978s MAGIC with Anthony Hopkins is a much better treatment of the subject. Ann-Margret is great in that film too.",1294272000,,2299,4.963636363636364

2826214,1,B000PMLJMG,"As a horror movie featuring a menacing ventriloquist dummy, I thought this one might be interesting in a campy, 80s kind of way. There was, as I recall, an early Tales from the Crypt episode that used a similar theme successfully. Not so here. As it turned out, it was ninety minutes of relatively bland, predictable horror fare. Very few--if any--scenes were actually frightening at all. It was more of a funhouse with pale, ghostly, mutilated specters popping up and going boo and wooden ventriloquist dolls turning their eyes and heads of their own volition. Unfortunately, more than once they crossed the line where attempted horror becomes silly, even comedic. Not good, and yet that's the risk inherent to employing dolls or puppets as creatures of supposed evil incarnate. More effective were the usages of other means of unsettling the viewer, such as the images of humans carved into puppets. Anyway, there were a few interesting audio and visual effects here and there, albeit nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. The atmospherics and background story of Ravens Fair was kind of cool, although the story of Mary Shaw and the revelation about what is truly happening there is kind of lackluster and shallow. This movie got so tedious after about an hour that I had trouble sitting through the last thirty minutes or so. Alas, it was worth the effort as this entirely ordinary, forgettable film is saddled with a killer twist at the end. It almost doesn't seem deserving of it.",1253577600,2,1497,4.897637795275591
2826215,4,B000PMLJMG,"I'm just going to come out and say it... I like Dead Silence. Do yourself a favor and forget the fact that it was directed by James Wan of the Saw franchise. This movie is NOTHING like Saw. So when they marketed it towards the gore-hound, torture violence crowd they set themselves up for a backlash. Dead Silence is a good ol' fashion ghost story. It hardly has any gore, but it has plenty of creepy atmosphere to amp up the scare factor.

Dead Silence has a simple storyline and I really dug it. Jamie Ashen's (Ryan Kwanten) wife is murdered a few minutes into the film. The distraught Jamie heads home to find out more about the creepy ventriloquist dummy that showed up at his doorstep...minutes before his wife died. What follows is a tense journey into a small hick town with a bumbling detective (a scene stealing Donnie Wahlberg) hot on Ashen's trail. This ghost tale focuses on dead Ventriloquist Mary Shaw. Shaw had no children so she treated her dolls like her family. Oh, and apparently after she croaked she decided to haunt the lives/dreams of people from her hometown. According to a children's poem if you ever see her in your dreams, you shouldn't ever scream...or she'll kill you. There is a great sound effect of everything going eerily silent just before she shows up (hence the title). Dead Silence is a throw-back to the 70s where what you didn't see, was sometimes scarier than what you did. It's an effective tactic for scaring the bejeezus out of people and I wish more film-makers would employ it today.

Dead Silence isn't the greatest horror movie and at times it tries very hard to be clever (the ending in particular). However, it's different enough that I found it very enjoyable to watch. Its moody atmosphere was much more terrifying than your run of the mill gore-fests that hit theatres these days. The movie does an excellent job of making you feel tense and uneasy until the final credits roll. Turn off the lights, crank up the volume and watch this one alone or with your significant other.

(A simple horror movie that unexpectedly caused a split among Our Rotten Staff, something you'd expect in a presidential election, but not at The Rotten Review.

In any event, our Liberal Progressive Wing gets the first shot.)

FROM THE LEFT:  Remember ""The Ring"", ""Skeleton Key"" or the first Phantasm?  How about ""Blair Witch"", ""Darkness Falls"" or ""Silent Hill""?  Apparently, the makers of ""Dead Silence"" were hoping you'd forget - as their movie is a pastiche that borrows against those other movies, essentially using thrills available in the public domain.

It starts out with Jamie Ashen, a young married dude with a family history.  Living away from home, life is good, until he comes home to find his expecting wife brutally murdered, her body (especially her face) mutilated.  His only clue is a menacing ventriloquist dummy mysteriously sent to him before the murder.  Linking the doll to his hometown, Jamie returns home and finds the town in the last stages of decrepitude - stores closing, people disappeared.  The only safe business is the funeral home.  Jamie finds his rich father has remarried a comely young woman named Ella, a useful device for us to learn that Jamie's father is a man who uses people and then replaces and erases them.  He will soon learn that the town, and especially his family, share a dark secret relating to Mary Shaw, a malevolent crone killed when she was suspected of having something to do with the year's past death of a boy who would have been Jamie's uncle, and that Jamie's wife shared a grisly fate suffered by many other citizens of the town.  Donnie Wahlberg plays a big-city detective who will drive the plot forward by suspecting and then assisting Jamie - it's a device that was old when used in ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Sentinel"", and those movies came out in the `70's!!

Is it the vengeful ghost of Mary Shaw come to wreak vengeance?  Will others suffer that same fate?  Will you be forced to sit through numerous fake-scares followed immediately by the real one?  You betcha!!

What really kills the movie is the way that it offers nothing new.  The script prepares you for Weapons of Mass Terror, and it isn't until you're knee deep in corpses that you realize how you've been bamboozled with nothing more than bits of other movies.  Good movies can scare you, but bad movies like this scare you in a way that embarrasses you - getting you to lower your expectations with no real payoff in the end.  I suppose that our staff's resident Neo-Cons will love this movie, given how cravenly they fear anything new or imaginative.

*****

FROM THE RIGHT: my so-called ""progressive"" colleagues have gotten this movie wrong.  Like any liberals, they go for instant-gratification: where's the WMT? Why did we choose this movie when we could have enjoyed that other movie?  Osama doesn't even appear in this movie?  We may be Neocons"", but we know that a horror movie is more than the sum of some scary moments.

""Dead Silence"" is an interesting study in horror because it contains many scary ideas - most of them admittedly dated, deliberately so.  This is the movie's most inventive idea - tricking you with some obvious plot devices and amateurishly expository dialog and, once you're defenses are down, jabbing you with genuinely effective chills.  Mary Shaw is an uncommonly seductive villainess because, unlike the ghostly evils at the heart of movies like ""Darkness Falls"", she's not a woman who is hiding anything - she performed her evil magic and let everybody think it was just ventriloquism.  The secret of the movie is just how much of its evil is actually in plain sight.  Best of all, ""Dead Silence"" does this repeatedly - making you think you're watching a parody of a horror movie, then going for your jugular with a sincere scare.  If anything, the movie is weakest when emulating more recent contemporary movies like ""The Ring"" and best when it channels great old TV movies like ""Burnt Offerings"", ""Dark Night of the Scarecrow"" and ""Don't be afraid of the Dark"".  The direction keeps things chilled with a great eye towards scene transitions and settings (besides Mary Shaw's ruined theater, we have the dying town and especially the Ashen family manor - the last of these possessed of an interior dotted with the most consistently ominous examples of portraiture.  You keep expecting the pictures to grab you).  And lest you think otherwise, the movie closes with a genuine surprise ending.

TO SUM IT UP - we offer this assessment from our resident Whig:

""Dead Silence"" is definitely a guilty pleasure - like a candybar, your enjoyment has nothing to do with surprises.  At a shade over an hour and a half, it's a brisk story, but one that keeps you watching.",1230681600,,4746,4.806411837237977
2826222,4,B000PMLJMG,"I wasn't expecting much out of this movie to be totally honest.  I mean, come on, another ""dolls come to life and kill innocent people"" movie?  How many of those have their been?  How can this movie do what hasn't been done a thousand times already?

Well, maybe Dead Silence doesn't break any new ground in the horror genre, and truthfully the movie certainly isn't miles above other similar kinds of horror storylines due to falling victim to ordinary Hollywood cinematography and cliches, but what it succeeds in doing is scaring the living heck out of me, and the best thing of all is that the dolls (or rather, one doll- a ventriloquist dummy) is unpredictable in how he choses to torture and kill people.

In other words, the doll doesn't always come to life at the moment the characters turn their backs unlike other scary movies I've seen before that do.  Oh sure, *sometimes* the dummy doll turns murderous the moment someone turns around, but most of the time not.  This is a surprising highlight for me and adds a bit of creativity to the horror genre.  You're never sure when he's going to strike.

 The story involving the old crabby attitude doll-obsessed lady who's the ventriloquist and becomes one with the dummies so to speak, and the creepy old man in a wheelchair who's the father of the main character (played by Ryan Kwanten) are both fantastic actors, as is Ryan himself.  I wish the police detective wasn't so stereotypical though- a real downer there.  Of *course* he's going to accuse Ryan of killing his wife when Ryan desperately explains that the real killer is the dummy, but the writing is sort of terrible whenever the cop appears.  Oh well, minor complaint.

Of course we probably ALL get the creeps when thinking about dolls moving their eyeballs around, and that happens here on a few occasions.  The scene where Ryan is driving the dummy to a cemetery to bury him forever only for the doll to suddenly turn his head/eyes towards Ryan is unbelievably creepy!

The storyline is really good too, because it's half mystery/half horror.  The story works most of the time, because there's tons of suspense, and you get the feeling something frightening is going to happen at any moment.  That's where the movie succeeds- not knowing what's about to happen while building suspense.

Another thing that scares the pants straight off my legs is what happens just BEFORE the dummy goes into ""killing mode"".  The surroundings gradually become quiet, and the atmosphere would greatly intensify before finally reaching a temporary standstill.  Anything making a sound gives off this frightening dying sound (similar to playing a cassette tape in a tape player with low batteries and hearing the sound of the voices become deeper and slower).  REALLY awesome experience!  Then the characters hear nothing but silence (hence the name of the movie) prompting the dummy to do his cold-hearted killing spree on whoever's around.

Very good movie but doesn't have any replay value I'm afraid- after the first viewing it's not NEARLY as chillingly effective after that.",1230681600,,3085,4.877159309021113
2826223,3,B000PMLJMG,"Looked forward to seeing this movie ever since we made the acquaintance of star Ryan Kwanten on TRUEBLOOD, the HBO scripted series in which he plays the heroine's dumb brother.  He's great in that, but now that I've seen him in DEAD SILENCE, I can only surmise that on TRUEBLOOD, it's his buttocks that do all his acting for him, and they should be awarded the Emmy for the superlative work he puts them through on that show.  Here they are continually hidden underneath an unsavory pair of jeans, and thus poor Ryan has literally nothing to work with.  In a way this acting theory matches the premise of DEAD SILENCE, a film that asks us to believe that an entire town, Raven's Fair, has only a few residents in it, and all of them are controlled by the vengeful spirit of Mary Shaw, an amateur ventriloquist of the early 1950s who loved both children and dolls until one snippy little rich boy spoiled her show by exclaiming loudly that he could see her lips moving.

In consequence everything starts going wrong for both Mary Shaw and everyone she knows.

The film suffers from an extremely low budget.  They could only afford to hire about four actors, to represent not only the populace of the godforsaken town, but also the entire population of NYC.  They could only afford three colors also, so everything is drenched in deep blue, except when Jamie gets into a red car or a horrible ghost tears out red tongues from people's mouths.  And there's black as the third color, but how cheap can you get?  But they really could have saved money, as well as improving the film about 1,000 per cent, by leaving the pants off Ryan Kwanten and his unforgettable assets.  Oh what a waste.",1230508800,3,1685,4.549668874172186

Soon after, entire families are found murdered with their tongues ripped out.  Legend has it that if you see her ghost and scream, you will have your tongue ripped out.

2826242,1,B000PMLJMG,"Dead Silence. Boy was I so eager to see this when it was out in the movies, and when it came to DVD, I almost jumped out the week it came out to buy it. Thankfully, I never did, and then I forgot about it, until last week, when I found it on the discount rack at my local used DVD store. I thought this was one of the worst horror/thriller flicks that I have seen in the past few years (Valentine and Ghost Ship get honrable mention). The characters are so dumb, and I mean dumb, that it is laughable. I understand that some movies are based on Fantasy, so we are supposed to look past the things that are un-belivable and use our imaginations, but when you see how dim-witted the characters are (Donnie Walberg, that means you)you just cant even imagine human beings being so stupid nor can you even believe that this could ever happen. When we watch some movies that are Fantasy and we get so sucked in, we actually believe the events could have happened (Lord of the Rings is a prime example, unrealistic, but the story gets you so sucked in) The are no scares in this film at all, and why in gods name is this Unrated? or even rated R. It has no nudity, hardly any language, and just some disturbibing images, no worse then The Grudge. Check it out, and see what I mean. The acting is horrid, the story-line is a rip off of Dolls and Child's Play, and it is slow, and I mean slow. There is nothing here that shows good signs of a decent Thriller/Horror movie. I just don't understand some of the reviews being so postive. . Where are the thrills? Where are the parts that have my hair standing on end? Why in Gods name did I almost fall asleep a few times? OK, I will agree as I stated above that there is some nice eerie effects that gives the film a Silent Hill type atmosphere (the video game, not the stinkball movie) The score is decent, and the twist at the end, kind of makes you go..hmmm, that is pretty interesting, but that is about it. Just not enough to save the movie from the bottom of the barrel. If you are looking for a Thriller that is mostly story line, that will have you on edge the entire film, try the 1980 version of The Shining.",1212537600,,2157,4.2

2826254,5,B000PMLJMG,"Originally titled ""The Doll and Mary Shaw"", Dead Silence is a 2007 horror film about a ventriloquist named Mary Shaw who was murdered after a young boy heckles her & comes up missing. She takes her vengeance on the town through her dolls. Directed by James Wan & Written by Leigh Whannell(Creators of Saw); it stars Donnie Wahlberg(yes, of 'New Kids on the Block' fame), Ryan Kwantan, Amber Valletta & Judith Roberts.

Unfortunately, Dead Silence didn't do too well at the box-office making around $16.5 Million domestically at the time of its' release in theaters. DVD sales has upped that amount to over $20,861,015 Worldwide. It took an estimated $20 Million to make the film. There are rumors of a sequel being made in the near future but the chances of it seem unlikely. We'll have to wait and see... ;)

In my opinion, Dead Silence is a great Horror movie. Definitely one of my favorites. One that I hope will see a sequel. It's a good choice for a 'Friday Night Fright'.",1208476800,,977,4.641618497109826

Although maybe not quite in the same league as Mario Bravo's best works, this movie does remind me quite a bit of his films. While the subject matter - a haunted ventriloquist dummy - isn't exactly original, director James Wan manages to pull this off and infuse it with a creepiness I haven't seen in the movies in a long time...well maybe since Mario Bava.  So, don't let any negative reviews dissuade you from at least renting this. I definitely recommend ""Dead Silence"" for scares & creepiness that harken back to late 50's, early 60's horror films. And make sure you watch this on a surround sound system for the best effect.",1208217600,,802,4.728571428571429

2826257,3,B000PMLJMG,"James Wan, who made his name by directing the smash hit ""Saw"" back in 2004, comes back with another horror film. But ""Dead Silence"" (written by Leigh Whannell, script writer of the original ""Saw"" and co-writer of two sequels) looks more like homage to old horror movies. The film begins with an old black-and-white Universal logo; it doesn't rely on gores to scare, using atmospheric photography; and it certainly has no torture scenes. It looks as if James Wan really wants to distance himself from the hit franchise that gets more and more gory and violent.

In fact ""Dead Silence"" has many elements that could be found in old-fashioned ghost stories: a weird ""legend"" in a small town, an old lady warning about the impending danger, a creepy ventriloquist's dummy delivered on the doorstep of a married couple and so on. The story is about one Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten), who must go back to his hometown and discover the truths about the dummy and its creator.

Though ""Dead Silence"" offers some decent scares, its story is weak and characters boring, lacking something that really interests us. Moreover, characters including Jamie, the protagonist, go where they shouldn't go and do what they shouldn't do, missing every chance to understand what is going on. Donnie Wahlberg, as in the ""Saw"" sequels, again appears as a police detective who believes our hero is No. 1 murder suspect. The story mostly consists of a collection of clichd ideas except perhaps the one at the concluding section, which may not be really necessary.

""Dead Silence"" shows the filmmakers wanted to do something different after the success of ""Saw."" The film is a reasonably entertaining take of traditional horror genre with several spooky sequences, but it also needs a better script with logics and rules.",1206144000,,1790,4.96

Hollywood is allowed to make ANYTHING into a movie, even if everyone reading this review know that It Aint gonna happen. The movie was not boring, took a little long to get to the point, and I will admit, there were quite a few parts that made me yelp.

Event #3: On the floor in front of your apartment door, there is a big brown box on the floor, with your name and NO return address......>STOP!! With the wake of terrorist attacks, I am not TRUSTING the package because I don't know who dropped it off, I wasn't expecting a package, it's 11:00pm AND there's no return address? In what world does it constitute bringing that into your home? Hell, it wasn't even wrapped in pretty paper! I was PLAIN BROWN with black marker for goodness sake!! But let's say you are still curious ( I am pretty sure most of us were moaning at the main character at this point) and you bring that box into your home IGNORING ALL THE SIGNS.....

Event #4: Inside the box you find a creepy looking doll with the most evil look on his face.

Event #5: The box looks too much like a red satin lined coffin.

Event #6: Your psycho girlfriend starts singing a song about how this chick who loved ventriloquist dolls will kill you if you scream when she visits you in your dream......>STOP!!

The dolls alone are enough to give any sane person nightmares.  So why all the negative reviews?  What am I  missing here?

If you're a blood and guts fan this one isn't for you.  This film is heavy on suggestion and suspense, with special effects used more as the spice than the main treat.  Call it a thinking person's horror movie if you like.

Anyways, Jamie Ashen returns to his childhood hometown, Raven's Fair, after his wife was mysteriously murdered.  She was murdered almost immediately after the couple has received an anonymous mail at their doorstep, which contained a dummy.

Jamie soon learns that the dummy, Billy, is a product of a dead ventriloquist, Mary Shaw.  Mary Shaw was murdered some years ago after the townspeople suspected her of murdering a young boy who doubted her ventriloquist talent.  Her tongue was ripped out and she was buried with her ""children"", all 101 of her dummies.

However, these days, her dummies are coming back from the grave.  The question is why?  Who is behind these mysterious murders?  Mary Shaw?  Jamie and a local police detective (Wahlberg) must locate the mastermind or at least try to locate the curse and break it to stop the killings.

It sounds like a great movie after reading the jacket of the DVD cover.  However, the story plot is forgettable.  The acting...no comment.

With their piercing yet vacant stares, unnervingly diminutive features, and slack-jawed mouths, ventriloquist dummies have been a staple of horror stories ever since Rod Serling memorably brought a number of them to life in ""The Twilight Zone"" back in the 1950's and `60`s.  Probably the most famous theatrical movie on that subject has been 1975`s ""Magic,"" with Anthony Hopkins as the puppeteer haunted by his anthropomorphized wooden sidekick.  As with clowns, these creepy ersatz-humans have become a source of dread for many people - and moviemakers have been quick to exploit that fear.

The latest such endeavor is a movie entitled ""Dead Silence,"" which features Ryan Kwanten as a young man who, one fateful night, finds an anonymous package, containing a ventriloquist's dummy, sitting on his doorstep.  Before one can say ""Charlie McCarthy,"" the doll has done away with Kwanten's unsuspecting wife, with the young man himself the prime suspect in her killing.  In an attempt to prove his innocence, Kwanten heads to his hometown to investigate the legend of Mary Shaw, an old crone of a ventriloquist who met with a mysterious and untimely end a few decades earlier.

Despite its derivative nature, ""Dead Silence"" has enough creepy moments to make it a passable outing for the less discriminating horror movie aficionado.  Director James Wan and his screenwriting partner, Leigh Whannell, don't do anything with the dummy we haven't seen a million times before, but, let's face it, the murdering-ventriloquist-dummy sub genre is a fairly restrictive one by its very nature, with not much room for innovation contained within its rather strict parameters.

Kwanten makes for a bland central hero, though Donnie Wahlberg nicely fleshes out the role of the cynical and completely wrongheaded gumshoe assigned to the case.

Considering that Wan and Whannell are the filmmaking team behind the vile ""Saw"" films, ""Dead Silence"" is surprisingly tame in the gore-and-dismemberment department, with little graphic violence to spoil the mood.",1188604800,,2047,5.329192546583851

2826313,4,B000PMLJMG,"Although this title got some mixed reviews, it is actually pretty good for the horror fan. Unlike most recent movies (scream, etc.) this is not a teen-horror-comedy in any way. This is classic horror, ala Nightmare on Elm Street. I swear to god I'm afraid of seeing that old woman every time I walk past the bathroom at night. Its that scary. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously though, there are still some ""No!! Don't go into the dark basement"" parts, but its ok. It wouldn't be a real horror film without that type of stuff.

Overall the picture quality on the HD DVD is very good. Some of the scenes are simply breath taking. The cinematography is very good, especially the camera angles on establishing shots. A lot of the camera work and atmosphere reminded me of the Silent Hill movie. The sound is also very good. Although not perfect, there is really nothing to complain about in the picture and sound department.

Overall Id say this is the scariest movie I've seen in a while. Other recent horror movies such as Saw, Hostel, etc. were pure gore-fests and not really much horror. There are definitely a few parts in the movie I jumped and after the movie I had to turn all the lights on because I was still spooked. Just to be clear, this is still somewhat of a cheesy movie, but it is a fresh breather from all the horror-comedies and definitely one of the better horror flicks available in HD.",1187913600,3,1413,4.515625

2826325,4,B000PMLJMG,"""Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. She had no children, only dolls. And if you see her in your dreams, make sure you never, ever scream.""

Becoming a suspect in the mysterious death of his wife soon after a ventriloquist doll arrives on their doorstep unmarked, Jamie Ashen returns to the nearly desolate, ramshackled hometown of their childhood, RavensFair. There he buries his wife and begins to unravel a dark family secret that involves a once popular ventriloquist who refuses to stay dead as she enacts her revenge from beyond the grave.

Going into this movie I wasn't really expecting much. However, I didn't let all the negative reviews stop me from watching DEAD SILENCE because I tend to like films others generally don't, and so thankfully I enjoyed this more than I was anticipating.

I think many people were disappointed in this because it's by the same guy who brought us the very bloody and gruesome SAW, putting certain expectations in people's heads. DEAD SILENCE, on the other hand, is more of a ghostly atmospheric horror story filled with chilling suspense that often leads to nothing, and yet it keeps you spooked and constantly on alert.

I guess if your wanting lots of vivid, gutrenching gore than this isn't for you. But if you, like me, enjoy stories that rely more on atmospherics and haunting imagery (I also thought the soundtrack was pretty creepy and cool), you just might find yourself enjoying DEAD SILENCE. Just remember not to scream.",1187136000,2,1468,4.86
2826326,3,B000PMLJMG,"I stopped watching these kinds of films mainly because there are so many of them, it is tiring.  Unless one has a really good twist to it or dives more into a thriller or mystery kind of a plot, I tend to lose interest quickly.  Let me first say that this film does have some key actors in it like Don Wahlberg, and the production and filming are overall, exceptional.  I think the mystique behind anything in the old realm of magic or carnivals, whether it be magicians, clowns, or ventriloquist dolls is always fascinating and easily plugged into the horror or slasher genre at one point or another.

Problem is, this has been done over and over again, and even though I did enjoy the film and loved the twist at the end, I cannot help but feel a bit disappointed.  Almost everything is taking place at night and I am sorry but Wahlberg's detective role was lame, he himself is a great actor but his character was almost too lenient when it came to dealing with the possible murder suspect.

The only other complaint is more of a question:  Why is it that in so many movies like this, the main character happens to own a prestige, fully restored car from the 60's or 70's?  This is one of those forgotten clichs' in film but it is getting a little old.  I guess it would be not very cool for the main character to be driving a 1999 Dodge Neon or something.

The film deals in an old mystery and a family curse of sorts that deals with a doll maker from the past.  The story was somewhat interesting but again, I think I've heard it before.  Overall, this is not a bad film to see as far as horror thrillers go; it just definitely is not stellar.",1186704000,,1647,4.27741935483871

the HD DVD itself is a combo, which, depending on your situation, might be good or bad, if you are like me and have a lot of friends and family that don't have HD DVD then its a good thing, if you don't care about the Standard side then its not a good thing....overall the picture quality is pretty good, probably a 4 out of 5 rating on that, not the best certainly, but still a very nice transfer, sound is definitely good, a lot of the movie is very quiet (hence the name Dead Silence) and the surround works really well when it needs to....

2826329,1,B000PMLJMG,"""Dead Silence"" is director James Wan's private joke.  The punchline is the movie and the disheartening enthusiasm many horror fans have for it.

Comparing this comical and bluntly Grade B movie with that great episode of the ""Twilight Zone"" (""The Old Switcharoo""), ""Saw"" (which was good but overrated), or even ""Magic"" with Anthony Hopkins (which wasn't really that good at all), is to do a gross disservice to all three.

Donnie Wahlberg can't catch a break.  Ryan Kwanten turns in such a plastic performance here that not for one moment do we believe in Jamie Ashen or Det. Jim Lipton.

The premise of the movie is so ridiculous (a woman who owned dolls, preferring them to children, wreaked terror on a small town with the really creepy dolls that come alive and bark at people until their faces look just like the victims in ""The Ring"") that whatever expectations the viewer had of another ""Saw"" goes right out the window.

In my humble opinion, the only one who deserves any accolades or praise is the dummy.  At least he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut and stay under blankets half the time.  Starring in this movie, he made a smart move.",1186444800,6,1154,4.622549019607843
2826330,2,B000PMLJMG,"There are some well done shots and sequences in this film, which, given that the director/writer team did Saw, is not a surprise: whether you like that film or not, Saw knew exactly what it wanted to do and did it pretty darn well.  What is a surprise, given that Saw was very tight and smartly executed, is that there are so many questionable calls and ineffectual parts in Dead Silence.  Here, they seem to have been going for an old-fashioned feel, sort of a tribute back to the older days of horror to the kind of movie that once might have starred Karen Black (after all, who really has a thing about ventriloquist dummies anymore in the 21st century anyway?).  But, and I admit that this might be a personal reaction, I think the style of this movie runs completely counter to the effectiveness of that kind of a 70s retro-throwback idea.  Everything in Dead Silence is hyperactive and agressively stylized, and in the suspense scenes, goes fast cut and very flashy.  Honestly, I just don't think this approach works well with an evil old lady story and a bunch of dummies.  A movie with this sort of story and characters ought to be slower, creepier, and get under your skin.  This is just too slickly filmed and production designed for its own good but not that well done or thought out at the same time.  A case in point is the rather lame repeated children's warning about Mary Shaw: it's just not as catchy or well written as the filmmakers seem to think it is, so hearing it over and over, you get completely sick of it, rather than finding it chilling or haunting.

The lead actor is not that charismatic or convincing, and the lesser Wahlberg does just fine but his character is way too familiar and generic.  The woman who plays Mary Shaw is nicely cast but she should have been given much more to do.  The dialogue is pretty lame, plot twists passable; the ending isn't bad, to be fair.  I can't say this was disappointing because from the commercials, this looked to be a misfire and that's what it turned out indeed to be.  Well, better luck next time.",1186444800,,2070,4.488

I also figured prices of Hd-dvds would come down by now after the first year like dvds did but surprisingly they have not.  As for dead silence the sound and picture are always good on Hd dvd, also horror films in general have good sound, however this one does not stand out.
Great horror films can get us to forget what makes sense and get us to accept it.  They can also be realistic and terrifying and hone in on some hardwired fear we have.  Horror films can also purposely be so bad there good.  This really isn't any of the above.  The scares are the equivalent of me hiding and jumping out at you.  I think i guessed nearly everything that happened in the movie prior to it happening.  Other random things i found annoying, why does Donnie Wahlberg's character use a electric shaver everywhere? , why do we have to have ominous fog around a cemetery, bit cliche.  There are a lot of holes yet I don't lose myself in the movie and accept it.  As for the plot amazon provides a good enough description, no need to add to it.
Yes, I have seen worse horror movies, and yes this is a break from the torture porn genre however there are other picks for 2007 out there.  If you want to stay on the Hd dvd kick try The Host, again getting away from the torture porn, and one of the best reviewed films of the year getting a 92% positive rating on rottentomtoes out of 129 film critics whereas Dead silence got 17% positive out of 63 critics.  Better yet The Shining is now available to pre order on Hd dvd being released on October 23rd.  If you have a need to watch killer dolls, watch or re watch Child's Play.
My advice is if you like horror and you want to check out some new on dvd for 2007 just buy a cheaper version than the hd.

This is a classic ghost story.  With that said, and with that understood, let me first state something that is also important, this film does everything right.  The people who bring you this movie knows how to scare you, knows how to create illusions, knows how to play with your mind.  The lighting, the lack of colour, the actors, everything works together to create one of the best movies I've seen this year...at least coming from the United States (I tend to care more toward the Japanese horror movies because, unlike the majority of the American horror movies, they can tell one heck of a story).  Now I don't like the Saw movies.  And while I can say that, in some ways, I appreciate the Hostel movie (note, just the first one, not the second), the torture-horror films don't really impress me very much.  I want story.  I want mystery.  I want horror.  And this film delivers in every way, every shape, and every form.  Dead Silence is going to be in what I would call my top five horror movies (this includes Juan, Nightmare, Evil Dead II, Dead Silence <now>, and Alien).  The story takes you along a town that is cursed, a town whose evil curse calls forth a wayward son right off the bat, by way of killing (brutally) his girlfriend.  There are twists and turns.  All leading to Mary Shaw.  Who had no children, only dolls.  And she's not just dead, she's undead and very perturbed.  Needless to say, don't open your mouth.  The story keeps you guessing.  I won't give spoilers.  I hate it when people give me spoilers.  But I digress.

Possibly.

If that was the case, I understand their disappointment, but it also explains their narrow-mindedness and not judging a movie based on its merits. I will tell you, this is coming from a serious horror fan - I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!! This movie has all the atmosphere and suspense of the classic horror movies and I was so glad to see something come out in the horror field that wasn't all gore. To me, DEAD SILENCE delivers on what it set out to do, tell a classic ghost story that is both scary and suspenseful. If you are looking for something different in your horror, maybe you want to watch something that reminds you of those classic horror movies you used to watch late at night on the weekends as a little kid. If this is you, DEAD SILENCE is for you! I cannot recommend this movie highly enough, especially if you have 5.1 surround!!!!!!

If you're looking for another SAW, HOSTEL, or HILLS HAVE EYES, you will hate this movie and come in here and write a 1 star review. Look, save yourself the time and energy, you will not like DEAD SILENCE if that's what you want.

2826349,5,B000PMLJMG,"You've just gotten in and a package arrives - opening it you find it has a lovely in-lay that stands about two feet tall and is normally accustomed to sitting on the knees of ""performers"" while doing the ""Mary and Billy"" act. When you see it your wife decides to start a little jingle about a woman who ""had no children, only dolls"" and rhymes down a little more to a climax of ""pulling your tongue out if you scream."" So, what to do, what to do? Well, keep it, of course, and allow it to ruin your life. Apparently that is the way of things when you come from a town where death seems second nature, and more so when you come from a town that suffers from the plague of a death woman's curse that deals with little people made of wood, 101 to be exact, and a mystery within a mystery that evolves as you go home. Adding to that is the death of your wife, apparently she didn't heed her won jingle, and is had a facelift of the Jokeresque caliber.

While Dead Silence has had some starkly bad press, I thought it was entertaining and had some really creepy parts in it. There's something about a little doll with eyes that match up with a taxidermist's little plaything that I find bothersome, not to mention the background on the ""why"" in this cursed lil town. Apparently the tongue jingle - everyone seems to know it and some really seem to know it, to the point that it says a lot about the kind of force that's being dealt with. Its kind of like Cheers, where everyone knows your name, only you don't scream out ""Norm"" because you get your tongue removed from your mouth.
Personally it also sounds like a chance to pack up my bags and take a one-way trip back to ""anywhere but here""ville, but in solving the death of one's beloved many things become irrational - despite the nasty pictures.
And the pictures; they are nasty.

Personally, I liked the elements, the story, the acting, and even the way that this wasn't a newer edition of bad elements but more of an edition selected out of older nightmares I used to have when I was a kid. It reminded me of the Twilight Zone meets Stuart Gordon meets a field full of blood and Gene Simmon's like tongue-appeal, with nice elements of CGI to piece in some of the puzzles and nice pieces of a rather creepy woman and some rather creepy little friends edging the terror along. It didn't have a lot of what people seem to want from the horror genre these days - it was a little different and different seems to equate to boring some how. Still, I judge my movies on a old scale I developed back when Italian movies walked upright like the T-Rex's of the land and when forces like Evil Dead and Night of the Living Dead were panned by critics because they didn't deliver on the canned goods. I watch the movie and my wife watches it close by, and the more she jumps and the more I become ensnared in the plot the more I like it. Critics be burned as witches - they don't give out awards to horror in the mainstream so why should horror kowtow to them?
And I liked it because people were always screaming - apparently Mary doesn't care if you scream because you fall down a flight of stairs or because you had some results on Jenny as long as you show those pearly white and that little apparatus hinged inside your mouth.

I know the ""makers of Saw"" got many people up in arms when they watched the movie, too, and I know that people didn't expect what they saw. Still, it was what I expected from the beginning and the jingle - it was funny and it played well. Here we had a horror movie with a vengeful attitude that started with the beginning and then played out its pieces as the movie went along.
So, judging from the different sides of the same reviewing coin, it might be something to decide what you want to see and then weigh your options. This movie was a throw-back, a screamer flick with flinncher qualities, and it was also something that didn't involve the depraved games like ""Saw"" would have offered.
No - having your tongue removed because you scream, that's not enough.

Dropping your expectations when you wathc horror helps, and this is a good chance to try that because it is a movie where a dead woman puppeteers dolls JUST to get a chance at the one prize she's been after - the fish that sawm upstream. So, you have a classic revenge case, a horrible butcher that has reworked the whole town, a facelift gone wrong, terribly police work, the Perfect Doll, and a range of other dolls that make me feel uncomfortable when I think about them.
I really enjoyed the film, not expecting much and getting a lot more in the process.",1185062400,9,4595,4.333333333333333
2826350,3,B000PMLJMG,"Dead Silence (James Wan, 2007)

The team who brought you Saw return for Wan's first trip to the director's chair since his surprise smash hit. This one came and went with very little notice. Given the performance of a number of recent, and far inferior, films of its type, that's a crime. Dead Silence is a slick little horror flick that touches all the bases, and runs over all the familiar territory, without ever seeming terribly cliched.

Jamie Ashen (Summerland's Ryan Kwanten) receives a mysterious package on his doorstep one evening-- a ventriloquist's dummy. When he comes back from picking up dinner that night, his wife is dead. A bit too much of a coincidence for him, so, shadowed by police detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), Ashen goes back to the town where he grew up to find out what happened to his wife, and what it has to do with the doll.

You can probably see a good bit of this coming (though I freely admit the ending totally blindsided me), but that doesn't necessarily matter. After all, ventriloquist's dummies are just plain creepy. If you're looking for a movie that will unnerve you, and you don't like ventriloquist's dummies, this one's definitely worth checking out. *** ",1184716800,6,1209,4.798076923076923

This is one creepy old woman.
If she were my grandmother she would never be getting a kiss.

With a dark atmosphere that draws your attention,
And 2 creepy characters,
(the vengeful ventriloquist & her pasty faced dummy)
Dead Silence manages to paint us a unique, dark, vision on an otherwise blood-spattered canvas. (Not that I'm complaining about the blood.)
The writer and director of the original ""Saw"" continue to churn out top notch horror flicks.
This one's about vengeance and forgiveness.
A son unable to forgive his father, and the spirit of a ventriloquist (Mary Shaw) seeking vengeance against all who murdered her.
And of course, her vengeance wouldn't be complete unless she tore out  her victims tongues, (those who screamed anyway), and added them to her own.
Sounds weird, right?
Wait 'til you see her tongue.
The atmosphere & scenery are what ultimately give this movie it's gothic feel.  The ventriloquist living in an abandoned theatere outside of town.  Though it's conveinent and unbelievable, it's an effective image symbolizing how ventriloquism is a dying, all-but abandoned art-form shunned to the fringes of the art-world, much how 'Mary Shaw' lived on the edge of town.
The contrast of white on black also adds to the overall mood of the picture.  Most of the scenes are very dark, but not in a blinding way.  The atmosphere is a tool to draw your attention to the horror on-screen which is usually very bright in comparison, often times altogether white.
Which in some cases, is a real shocker, especially in the mortuary scene.

If you're frightened of old women or puppets, this one's for you.
Both are extremely creepy, and worth a peek.
And it's really nice to see some unique monsters again.

Overall:
The atmosphere was dark.
The deaths were horrific.
The characters were unsettling.
The story was interesting.
& The twist ending was blind-siding.
Worth not only a rental, but also a purchase.
My wife, who used to live in a house full of dolls couldn't sleep for days after catching this flick.
You will have nightmares if you watch it in the dark.

Every town has it's own ghost story, and a local folktale around Ravens Fair is about a ventriloquist named Mary Shaw. After she went mad in the 1940s, she was accused of kidnapping a young boy who yelled out in one of her performances that she was a [...]. Because of this she was hunted down by townspeople who in the ultimate act of revenge, cut out her tongue and then killed her. They buried her along with her ""children,"" a handmade collection of vaudeville dolls, and assumed they had silenced her forever. However, Ravens Fair has been plagued by mysterious deaths around them after Mary Shaws collection has returned from their graves and have come to seek revenge on people that killed her and their families. Far from the pall of their cursed hometown, newlyweds Jamie and Lisa Ashen thought they had established a fresh start, until Jamie's wife is grotesquely killed in their apartment. Jamie returns to Ravens Fair for the funeral, intent on unraveling the mystery of Lisa's death. Once reunited with his ill father, Edward, and his father's new young bride, Ella, Jamie must dig into the town's bloody past to find out who killed his wife and why. All the while, he is doggedly pursued by a detective who doesn't believe a word he says. As he uncovers the legend of Mary Shaw, he will unlock the story of her curse and the truth behind the threat from a rhyme in his childhood: if you see Mary Shaw and scream, she'll take your tongue. And the last thing you will hear before you die...is your own voice speaking back to you. Written by Christopher Hernandez

Now onto the HD quality. The sound is as always amazing. The video quality like most HD/BluRay releases to date is good in some places and not so good in others. I can't wait for the technology to get caught up to the potential.

The movie. I loved it! Most people are afraid of dolls and the ones in this film are flat out freaky. If you like atmospheric horror and think dolls are down right creepy check this film out. Acting was excellent, plot was well.....horror movie plot. The special effects were well done and not IN YOUR FACE like most horror these days. Pick it up, if your a horror fan you'll enjoy it. Most of the people who didn't enjoy it went in expecting Saw and it isn't anything like Saw.

2826369,3,B000PMLJMG,"There are some genuinely creepy moments in ""Dead Silence."" A wide-eyed, wooden dummy in the room is always a source of suspense. The movie gets especially interesting when its protagonist first returns to his hometown of Raven's Fair to bury his wife. Several suggestive scenes there might lead viewers to suspect a truly inventive horror. However these themes aren't developed in any coherent way. They are only explained in slapdash flashback at the end of the film. If they had been made into the concentrated heart of this film, this would have been a superior thriller.

As it is though, this movie loses its way in a hodgepodge of ghostly special effects. Avenging spirits are superimposed on all sorts of reanimated entities. It's like ""The Shining,"" which actually was a series of unrelated eerie plot lines paraded across the screen. But this film doesn't have any of The Shining's style or conviction. In fact, James Wan, the Director of ""Dead Silence,"" says in one of the DVD extras that he purposely threw every sinister visual he could think of - except the kitchen sink - into the story. Then when the film was almost complete - he threw in the kitchen sink as well. He boasts about this as if it were a good thing. However in fact, he spoiled his film with a superfluity of the supernatural.

In addition, he let too many amateurish performances crowd his scenes. The detective, for example, is very unconvincing.

There are perhaps some elements of this film that may haunt you. It features a good warning line that the townspeople repeat - ""Beware the stare of Mary Shaw..."" This incantation almost rivals the old rhyme that Madam Ouspenskaya recited to Lon Chaney, Jr. to warn him of his werewolf fate. ""Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night...""

On the whole though, there are many better film opportunities to be scared by potentially homicidal ventriloquist's dummies. There is of course Anthony Hopkins' turn in ""Magic."" However, the most truly frightening take and twist on the theme that I've seen was the Alfred Hitchcock TV episode entitled ""The Glass Eye."" That episode stars Tom Conway. It first aired in October of 1957 and is available in the complete ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" series.

Then if you want to catch a brief spoof of the genre, check out Seinfeld's ""The Chicken Roaster"" episode from that sitcom's 1996 season. Jerry and Kramer switch apartments and Jerry is left alone with Mr. Marbles, the dummy that Kramer acquired. He pulls the covers up to avoid facing whatever thing goes - not bump - but more ominously yet - pitta-pat, pitta-pat, pitta-pat in the night.",1183939200,6,2632,4.814159292035399
2826370,3,B000PMLJMG,"What do you do when you make a horror movie so popular that it not only starts a new horror fad (psychological gore might be a good categorization), but it also spawns three sequels? After the box-office success of Saw, James Wan passed the directorial baton on to Darren Lynn Bousman for the three Saw sequels, while still maintaining a presence in the series as writer and executive producer. Now Wan has teamed up again with writer Leigh Whannell (also from Saw) for the duo's first non-Saw film. Although more of a typical horror movie, Dead Silence isn't that far removed from the eerie tones and frightfully gory movies that their followers have come to expect.

Following the standard plot of a horror movie, Dead Silence is based around a creepy mysterious supernatural villain who is haunting and threatening the main character of the film. About halfway in, it is unsurprisingly revealed that our lead has familial history with the killer. A history that needs to be set right before the ghost's revenge destroys him.

The killer herself happens to be Mary Shaw, of whom much lore has been passed on over the years throughout the small town of Ravens Fair. Once an infamous ventriloquist, who lived in a gigantic theatre on a lake, she was killed in a shocking way and then buried (at her own request) with her 101 dummies. Her trademark is that she waits until you scream, and then kills you by ripping out your tongue, leaving your face a gaping terrifying mess. Now, with the arrival of an unmarked package bearing a dummy named Billy, it appears that Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife are being haunted by Mary Shaw's ghost. When his wife is brutally murdered, Jamie is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg)'s number one suspect. For an unexplained reason, Jamie feels the need to then return to his small, almost abandoned town of Ravens Fair to find some answers. In a series of schlocky meetings he finds out what he must do in order to rid himself and his town of the curse of Mary Shaw. As Jamie gets closer to the truth, Detective Lipton begins to realize that maybe there's more to his case than he originally suspected.

What separates this film from its horror peers currently flooding the cinema, and in fact manages to make the film interesting and downright spooky is Wan's tight, focused shots,  and unexpected methods of cutting between scenes: unfolding elaborate scenes only to have them fold in on themselves. John R. Leonetti's cinematography uses a color palette that's basically limited to blue, black, grey, green, and the occasional yellow and red keeps the tone of the film decidedly dark, and never lets the audience take in a reassuring breath of relaxation til the film's final moments. What could have been a remastered Chucky tale, with 21st century visual effects and a ventriloquist dummy in place of a red-headed kid's toy, in the hands of James Wan, turns into an enjoyable and lastingly frightening horror romp.",1183852800,2,2965,4.807843137254902

In the last several years, there have been so many horror films, and very few have been able to distinguish themselves.  ""Dead Silence"" is no different.  We have the photography that makes everything in a blue wash, the barely coherent plot (in this case, a grudge that begins because a boy can see a ventriloquist's lips moving.  Yes, really.), the chorus of celestial voices, the fast motion action.  It's as though the director went down a checklist of cliches.  Yes, the movie looks good but it doesn't look original; it's just more of the same horror shtick we've been getting.

Fault also lies with the plot: there is a big reveal at the end, as there almost always is, but it would have been much more interesting had it been developed.  As it is, the reveal left me wanting more, to finally have the movie make sense, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.

Dead Silence also marks a departure in terms of changing the pace from the torture horror sub-genre to a more typical slasher fare which we get here.  The change isn't necessarily for the better either, even though Dead Silence has more going for it than you may think it does.  For starters, it's pretty safe to say that many people think of ventriloquist dolls as being creepy by themselves, and here the film doesn't disappoint.  Besides the overly creepy atmosphere though, Dead Silence doesn't do much else right in the horror department, and isn't scary or remotely suspenseful one bit.  The gore effects aren't much to write home about either, and the film as a whole just feels lazily put together.

She had no children only dolls
And if you see her in your dreams
Be sure to never ever scream.

One day Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) gets this package with a ventriloquist's dummy named Billy and by the time he gets back from having gone out he finds his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan), is dead.  Not only is she dead, but she is missing her tongue.  If you can connect the dots between Lisa's death and the above rhyme then you can tell where ""Dead Silence"" is going.  Jamie brings Laura back to their hometown of Ravens Fair, even though that means seeing his father, Edward Ashen (Bob Gunton) and his latest trophy wife, Ella (Amber Valletta).  Tagging along is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), who thinks Jamie is the primary suspect in his wife's death and wants to keep an eye on him.  Meanwhile, Jamie is trying to find out more about this whole Mary Shaw think from Henry Walker (Michael Fairman), the local undertaker.

""Dead Silence"" is made by director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell, the same team that came up with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-Trilogy/dp/B000GA5NYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw Trilogy</a>.  It came out in March of this year, although I do not remember hearing about it and doubt that it made it to this neck of the woods.  I happened to see ""Dead Silence"" the same day I saw a wretched rip-off of ""Saw,"" so to see a horror film that actually looked good was quite refreshing and I was rather encouraged.  However, this is probably not the first horror story you have seen involving a ventriloquist's dummy and style can only take you so far in this genre.

The problem is connecting to the story and I think this film starts to get off track when they try to rhyme ""Shaw"" with ""dolls.""  I mean, I have no problem with scant rhyme, but this is not even close to being in the ballpark.  After the death of his wife, Jamie is the prime suspect in the mind of Detective Lipton (a nod to Wahlberg's role in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Band-of-Brothers/dp/B00006CXSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Band of Brothers</a>""?), but in the day and age of what is called ""The C.S.I. Effect,"" it should be obvious that Jamie did not do it.  He might have hired somebody to do it, but clearly the blood on him would have come from finding his wife dead, as he claims, and not from being there when she was being murdered.  So I was starting to disconnect from the story at that point, especially since Lipton is required to given Jamie enough rope to hang himself, which, of course, he uses instead to discover the horrible truth.

Beyond the nice production values here, the best part of this movie is Judith Roberts as Mary Shaw when we finally get to go back to the past and see her do her act.  I am not sure if her big line is really that much better than the rhyme they come up with for Mary Shaw, but damn, Roberts knows how to deliver it for what might be the best chill in the whole movie. But by the time you get to the film's end game you just are not invested in the outcome.  This is one of those films where they do a nice job of setting up the reveal at the end, which is certainly not surprising with Wan and Whannell involved, but I find it difficult to muster much enthusiasm for it.  All things considered, ""Dead Silence"" does this type of horror film by the numbers, but it just does not add up to a ""must see"" film for fans.  I do not think that you will be bitterly disappointed if you check it out. I just think you not end up being as impressed as you think you should be.",1183075200,,3648,4.6003086419753085

2826396,3,B000PMLJMG,"To me, Dead Silence is another good horror movie idea presented poorly.  In the genre of horror, one is expected, to some degree, to suspend his/her disbelief for the entertainment of the otherwise improbable.  In some films, this works great.  In others, you start saying to yourself, ""Oh, come on.""  I found myself saying that more than once with this movie.  The atomosphere works well, and the musical score is not bad.  The acting is by no means top-notch, but it does not suffer much either.  It's the presentation of the movies concept that seems to drag down a possibly memorable and scary flick.  The legend of Mary Shaw and her dolls is an excellent start and no-one can deny the creepiness of ventroliquist dolls in general, but the way the story moves and the gaps that never seemed to get filled just make the movie a little less than enjoyable.  It has it's decent scares and of course, the expected surprise ending, but I can't see myself ever giving this movie a second watch.
I suppose there are some who will be enetertained by this film and will be entralled with it's few frights, but overall, this viewer was not all that impressed.  Theres an older, more disrbing ventriloquist film, starring Anthony Hopkins, entitled 'Magic'.  If scary ventriloquists are your thing, I'd recommend that one, now that's it's been released on DVD.",1182902400,4,1352,4.759656652360515
2826397,1,B000PMLJMG,"On first-look it seems to have everything old school Horror fans love: a murderous old woman's ghost, an army of evil dolls, dark family secrets, tragic lost love, and a sleepy town drenched in fog. With a look rivaling some Hammer films it's undeniable that it has style to burn... And that's it. It's critical and commercial failure upon release hardly comes as a shock; you'd expect this wooden abortion to premiere on the Sci-Fi channel before being dumped straight-to-dvd. Beyond the veneer of this dummy is a superficial excercise in futility that shows you shouldn't bank on success.

After the opening credits all brain function is immediately shut off. A newlywed couple are trying to have a baby, Slappy from Goosebumps shows up, death and idiocy ensue. Our protagonist returns to his hometown to play gumshow among a population of four with a shaving detective in pursuit. He discovers a vengeful ventriloquist's phantom with a party favor string of tongues. If you can formulate a plot from the listless scenes that let writer Leigh Whannel air his familial damage give yourself a pat on the back. ""Whose the dummy now?""

Critics have called this film slow but it's more accurate to site the utter lack of narrative drive. More to the point, it's like getting knocked on the head and led through a kiddie ride haunted house for 90 minutes. After a half-hour of the emotionless WB lead wandering aimlessly through decrepit locales the question is begged, ""Where the hell are we going?"" The only nonsensical excuse from the filmmakers for this Grand Guignol circle jerk is, ""The Saw films did well."" But ghosts were never meant to kill people in grisly ways, and it's this lack of subtlety that turns what could be something spooky into a lame neo-slasher. People could see the antagonist as a shameless lift of Freddy Krueger (and they'd be right) but to draw comparisons to better films makes it seem as if the filmmakers were motivated by anything other than fame. Under James Wan's direction Donnie Wahlberg (whose turn in The Sixth Sense is unforgettable) becomes the caricature of a poorman's Vince D'Onofrio to be senselessly killed (an electric shaver buzzing along the floor as a campy death note) along with the rest of the cast. Unmotivated homicide runs rampant and everyone's head is on the chopping block, including the genre's. Dead Silence proves there's been a great generational disconnect no ammount of aesthetic could ever fix and that the old school is very and truly dead.",1182902400,7,2504,4.903301886792453
2826398,5,B000PMLJMG,"I have always liked monster movies and ghost stories.  Dead Silence is a gem in the genre.  It does not rely on buckets of blood, or gore infested effects.  Instead it offers atmosphere, solid acting and (most precious of all) a plot that holds together.  The twist at the end is a great treat.
  Mary Shaw, a famous ventriloquist in her day, makes for an eerie and scary character both before (probably a monster) and after (definitely a monster) her death.  The story offers questions with the coin of madness and genious as its' two sides.
  I highly recommend this film.",1182902400,3,574,4.603960396039604

2826400,4,B000PMLJMG,"Jamie Ashen's wife is murdered, shortly after the couple receives the anonymous gift of an antique ventriloquist dummy called Billy. Uncovering a clue on the case the doll arrived in, Jamie heads for his hometown of Raven's Fair, where a puppet-mistress called Mary Shaw is said to have laid a deadly curse.

There've been rumblings here and there that Universal Studios whittled Dead Silence into something a little less than intended. If that is true, I'm holding out hope for the unrated cut on disc. I understand there's an alternate ending, and I'm curious to find out more. I saw the film in its theatrical release, and overall, I liked it: It's very atmospheric, and it's refreshing to see a director (James Wan, of Saw fame) keep trying new things.

The dolls in this movie are truly creepy, and if that's what you're after, plan yourself a marathon of certain episodes of The Twilight Zone, X-Files, the 70s classic Magic, and of course, Dead Silence as the cherry on top.

2826401,4,B000PMLJMG,"I'm going to go against the grain with this one. I found DEAD SILENCE to be an enjoyable movie. Sure it's done by the same guys that brought us the 'SAW' trilogy, but here they're showing us that they have versitility. I really liked the gray wash on this movie, and I had read that it was a tribute to the Hammer films.

2826403,2,B000PMLJMG,"This movie is irritating as soon as it begins. The tacky post-production looks like something a highschool student who just learned how to use filters would do to make their movie look ""cool."" The stop-motion and excessive use of very unrealistic ""old-movie"" grain overlays in the introductory credits and in transition scenes throughout the movie draws attention to itself in a way that completely distracts from anything they're actually showing on screen, and makes the images themselves more abstract and much less scary. The fifteen-year-old who edited this REALLY needs to learn some restraint.

Aside from that, the plot really isn't worth commenting on. It's filled with holes, and the ending defies the little logic that was there.

A few of the scenes of the dummies, particularly the ones set in the past, are genuinely creepy. That's pretty much the extent to which this movie is any good.",1176249600,,901,5.081081081081081
