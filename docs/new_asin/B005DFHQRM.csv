4659620,5,B005DFHQRM,"As a child I seen only a few episodes of this outstanding series and fondly remembering that it made me laugh back then. Recently my spouse mentioned seeing it as well and tweeted ""I want this"". Leaving no opportunity to let a surprise go away, I bought it and both are enjoying the episodes once again. Which still stand up to this day and age.",1385596800,3,345,4.323076923076923
4659621,5,B005DFHQRM,Great TV series for the whole family. There should be more shows like this one. It really presents the struggles immigrant families face when they need to adjust to their new lives in the US.,1378684800,3,191,4.485714285714286

4659623,5,B005DFHQRM,"As as born and raised Miamian of Cuban descent, there is nothing that hits closer to home than this show. It was years ahead of it's time as it was the first recorded bilingual show in television history. When I was a kid, my favorite Spanish Literature teacher used to have ""Que Pasa USA Fridays"" and we'd skip our curriculum and watch recorded episodes from PBS on VHS. This show is the comfort food for my soul (as well as many of my friends) and will always hold a very special place in my heart. Pay no mind to the guy who wrote the comment about the sound...pfffft...turn the volume up Debbie Downer.",1374796800,43,606,4.371681415929204

Strong pressure was put from the outside and plastic clips on the inside broke and now the dvd case is not holding the dvds in place. Extremely disappointed. This is the second set I buy this week.

4659629,5,B005DFHQRM,"Que Pasa USA? La Completa Collecion.

A Must for any fan of the show I grew up watching this TV show and it's a trip down memory Lane for this American Born Cubiche although they could have re-mastered the episodes it gives it an authentic vintage feel as if watching it back then, the show came a few years(not many) before I was born so I have seen every episode but I wasn't going to shell out money to Public Tv where it aired for a pledge of $100 I got my set brand new Sealed on ebay for Under $20 shipped. Like I said it's not remastered but it is hilarious and if you're Cuban specifically of the Old School(The Best) you will know what it's about and see how authentic the actors and series was.

4659736,5,B005DFHQRM,"So excited to have these DVD sets!  I am Cuban and we grew up in a very traditional and old school style on how our parents raised us.  We only spoke Spanish at home.  Once I had my own family, we tried to raise our children speaking Spanish at home.  Of course, the kids learned English a lot faster than I did when I was growing up.  They would come home from school and started answering us in English when we spoke to them in Spanish.  Que Pasa, USA?  is about this Cuban Family that depicts how Cuban live as if they were still in Cuba(plastic cover on their furnitures to keep it new).  The grandparents live with their children to put in their opinions about child rearing.  The husband and wife always sounds like they're always fighting or arguing.  The kids think their parents are too behind times in their hipness.  We laughed as a family when we would watched the show weekly!  Very creative writing of the scripts!
I thought it would be great to show our children how we live like them on a daily basis! It is great to reminisce about the way my parents were with us and my children.  Very happy with this purchase!  I've looked for these old series for awhile now and Amazon was able to fulfill my wish once again!  I can't wait to see the kids reaction when they watch these for the holidays!",1418256000,7,1308,4.30327868852459

4659739,5,B005DFHQRM,I bought this gift for my American boyfriend and he loves it.  His Spanish has improved a lot.  This might be a good replacement for roseta stone if you are someone who lives in the Miami area.  Cuban Spanish is the way to go in South Florida. He really enjoyed watching every episode.,1417305600,,285,4.339622641509434

Very good show!",1405296000,,150,3.4411764705882355
4659756,4,B005DFHQRM,"A terrific series. The writing is superb, and the casting could not have been better. I grew up in the same Cuban generation as the teens in this show, and it's like looking into my life of cultural confusion, and the push-pull of trying to develop an identity with one foot firmly planted in one country and one in another. Watching this show I am amazed anyone in my generation turned out as balanced, functional adults, with a sense of who they actually are! But it answered many questions for me, even while being thoroughly entertained and laughing myself silly. I only wish the sound quality on some of the episodes were a bit better.",1404432000,3,640,4.573913043478261

8466769,5,B005DFHQRM,"For any Cuban brings back wonderful memories of Cuban culture in the US after immigrating. A wonderful gift for my mother we have spent
hours watching and laughing about our own family which is depicted in all the stereotypes in this show. This was a brilliant show if you are Cuban and understand what it was like to immigrate to the US. The quality of the videos was acceptable but not great but that has more to do with the filming in the 70's then the product. I would recommend this as assigned viewing in any Cuban family that has children who now have no idea of what it was like to be an immigrant Cuban American family.",1525132800,2,628,4.330508474576271
