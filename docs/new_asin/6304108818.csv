7865171,3,6304108818,"I was disappointed in the character played by Rick Springfield.  He doesn't strike me as a ""bad guy"" type of individual.  He seemed more like a lunatic, though.  The movie did, however, have a good  storyline.
Probably won't watch again for a long while.",944524800,2,254,4.704545454545454
