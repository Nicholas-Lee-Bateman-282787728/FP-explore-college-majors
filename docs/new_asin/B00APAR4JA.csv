Luke Askew better known in the Green Berets does not really go over as a gun slinger. Tails you Loose is a little better but not a classic western by any means. It took me 4 times to watch both movies because I kept falling asleep.",1462492800,,402,4.302631578947368
8555657,5,B00APAR4JA,"2 excellent obscure Spaghetti Westerns that are quite entertaining. NEST OF VIPERS aka NIGHT OF THE SERPENT (ITALY 1969) was Luke Askews only foray into the Spaghetti Western arena and does an excellent job as an alcoholic gunslinger. TAILS YOU LOSE (ITALY 1970) starring John Ericson also was quite good. Both films are a hybrid of Film Noir and Spaghetti Western and both very dark. Both prints are quite good, NEST OF VIPERS 2:35 to 1 anamorphic and TAILS YOU LOSE 1:85 anamorphic and a must for any Spaghetti Western afficiano!!!",1402012800,3,533,4.868131868131868
8555658,4,B00APAR4JA,"The latest release from Wild East Productions boasts a double feature which blends the Spaghetti Western with the suspense thriller in two rare films starring two underrated American actors.  Up first is the best of the lot, Director Piero Pierotti's (here billed as Peter E. Stanley) 'TAILS YOU LOSE' aka 'HEADS OR TAILS' aka 'TESTA O CROCE'- 1969 starring John Ericson as an outlaw trying to solve a murder plot involving an innocent prostitute whom he is in love with.  Here the actresses shine as we have incredible performances by Sheyla Rosin and Danila Surima as well as an early appearance by Euro cult babe Edwige Fenech years before her Giallo thrillers with Director Sergio Martino and who graduated to sex comedies and here is involved in a brutally strong whipping sequence. Ericson is awesome as he disposes of the suspects leading to a tragic ending. It boasts a beautiful music score by Carlo Savina and intense camerawork by Fausto Zuccoli. Next we have character actor Luke Askew in his only Euro oater blasting his way through Director Giulio Petroni's 'NEST OF VIPERS' aka 'NIGHT OF THE SERPENT' aka 'NOTTE DEL SERPENTE' -1969. The scene stealer is Euro actor Luigi Pistilli in one of his best roles as a sleazy Mexican cop trying to steal an inheritance from a young boy by hiring Askew to assassinate him.  When Askew becomes aware of his target, he switches sides and the film erupts into a paranoid blood bath.  This film also boast two beautiful Euro actresses, the gorgeous Magda Konopka and the sultry Chelo Alonso along for the ride. It has a great Riz Ortolani music score and nice landscape photography by Mario Vulpiani and Silvio Fraschetti. It's only flaw is its periods of dullness peppered throughout its running time.  Although not as good as his masterpiece 'DEATH RIDES A HORSE' aka 'DA UOMO A UOMO'- 1967, its worth a look just for Pistilli's performance alone. Both films are presented in excellent Wild East style: 'TAILS' is in a brand new 1.85
widescreen transfer and 'VIPERS' in a 2.35 aspect ratio, both are in gorgeous shape.  Each has their own picture galleries, 'TAILS"" has its Italian trailer included along with another John Ericson Western Director Jose M. Elorrrieta's 'THE TREASURE OF PANCHO VILLA' aka 'SEVEN FOR PANCHO VILLA'-1966 and 'VIPERS"" with its own trailer.  Again, another great Spaghetti Western package from Wild East as two rarities in the genre get their deserved releases.",1358553600,7,2442,4.927007299270073
