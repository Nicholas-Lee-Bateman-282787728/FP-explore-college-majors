7900541,5,7885881512,"Another reviewer here asked: ""why even watch this movie?""  I hope to answer his question.  I also rated this film five stars for reasons I hope to describe here.  Firstly, let me explain that I am an Italian American with one set of grandparents coming to America from Sicily.  I believe that if one has Italian ancestry, it may be easier to appreciate many merits of this film other than merely the personage of Ingrid Bergman.  Her beauty is clearly on display in the film although her character is more troubled and has little time of displaying joy.  The ""hysterical"" perspective I refer to is due to the emotional nature of Bergman's character.  She marries a Sicilian fisherman for a wrong motive, in order to escape an Italian internment camp after World War II when actually she desires to live in Argentina.  Today, there are large Italian Communities in Australia, Argentina, America, England etc. and the story line of this film makes reference to this diaspora.  Thus, some historical perspective as to how Italians became dispersed in various parts of the world is described. Also, in this context, the family of the Sicilian fisherman describe the phenomenon of Sicilians going to America yet returning to Sicily because ""it is their home"". Many Italians could not tolerate the asphalt concrete culture of New York City and did return to Italy.  Living in the shadow and profile of an active volcano plays large in this film as the Island of Stromboli is actually an active volcano.  Historicity comes in again masterfully as Rossellini depicts the ""Mattanza"".  This is a fishing event for 400 pound blue fin tuna that dates backs to Phoenician or Carthage historical periods.  I have never seen footage of the mattanza as Rossellini has captured it here and for this scene alone, I rate the movie FIVE STARS.  There is much history and tradition associated with the mattanza but I will not go into that here.  Spiritual surrender by Bergman at the end is magnificent as well and contributes to my high rating.",1440806400,,2024,4.843023255813954

 There's quite a bit of interesting history to 'Stromboli' that goes beyond the film itself. First of course was the scandal of star Ingrid Bergman shacking up with director Roberto Rossellini and having a child out of wedlock with him. Her reputation in the U.S. suffered until she made a comeback in 'Anastasia', winning the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1956. Then there was also the controversy over the international film rights to the English language version of the film which resulted in a court fight between Rossellini and RKO Pictures.

The Criterion Collection features two versions, one dubbed in Italian and the English version which also contains some Italian dialogue. Ingrid Bergman plays Karin, a Lithuanian woman, who finds herself in an Italian camp for displaced persons after World War II. She marries an Italian POW, Antonio, who she meets on the other side of the barbed wire, separating the men from the women in the camp.

The couple ends back up in Antonio's fishing village on Stromboli, a volcanic island, near Sicily. Karin, a high maintenance woman used to material pleasures, resents being on the island for several reasons. First off is the threat of death or injury from the volcano itself, which periodically spews boulders and volcanic ash on the hapless village below. Then there's the hostility of the villagers (particularly the remaining female residents) who chastise Karin for her lack of ""modesty."" Karin also has trouble with her husband Antonio, who she regards as a simpleton and unpolished. In one telling scene, he pits a ferret against a defenseless pet rabbit, which upsets Karin greatly. Antonio, on the other hand, finds this quite amusing.

Karin doesn't help things for herself when she refuses to listen to the counsel of the village priest, who urges patience, until Antonio can make enough money so they can leave the island. Even worse is when Karin attempts to seduce the priest, which alienates him greatly. Later, Karin flirts with a lighthouse keeper in front of the villagers, which damages her reputation further.

Rossellini used the village locals in most of the scenes. Some of them apparently had spent some time in the U.S. and came back to Stromboli in their later years. As a result, a few are able to speak some English. The scenes where the men are helping Karin and Antonio to fix up their home, felt believable, but I wondered if the scenes of outright hostility by the local populace (particularly the women), wasn't simply an example on Rossellini's part, of forced drama (after all, if the real-life villagers were so hostile to the idea of a narrative that features an interloper that they can't stomach, would they have actually agreed to participate in the film itself?).

Perhaps the best aspect of the film is the on-location cinematography, particularly the excellent scene of the fishermen hauling in the tuna. Karin is juxtaposed with the big fish catch, as she is depicted as a person alienated from nature. Only when she gets into a direct confrontation with nature (after attempting to escape the island and threatened by the volcano) does she finally have an epiphany, accepts her situation and realizes that her arrogant stance, is untenable.

The role of Karin is an unusual one for Ingrid Bergman, as the protagonist here is not exactly very likable. In one respect, the part reflects Bergman's situation in her own life during that time. In marrying Rossellini and now living in his world, she had to fit into a completely different culture then where she came from.

I'm on the fence as to whether there's enough there in Bergman's role of the dissatisfied and stuck-up interloper who eventually finds redemption, to keep one's interest. Yes we 'get' the idea that she's alienated but her complaints go on for a little too long. Nonetheless, 'Stromboli' has all that local 'color' featuring the real-life inhabitants of the island as well a few dramatic scenes which will definitely keep your attention (the volcano eruption, the big tuna catch, etc.). The Criterion Collection also has a number of extras worth watching, including an interview with a prominent Italian film critic.",1412812800,2,4223,4.995732574679943

7900544,4,7885881512,This film is a child of it's time but I like it because it reminds me of a wonderful trip to Stromboli last summer.,1360368000,,115,3.8333333333333335
7900545,5,7885881512,"I love films in the tradition of Italian Neo-Realism: taking the camera out of the studio, into the streets and ordinary rooms, with minimal contrivances of narrative or at least the  illusion; attempting to show life as it is ""really"" lived, people as they are; films which give me convincing glimpses into other lives, other realities.

""Stromboli"" certainly does so. Bergman is completely convincing as a woman without a country, with no attachments, not even to a set morality, for whom (to borrow a phrase) all that was solid has melted into air, who is simply trying to survive and find a place for herself. All the other roles are convincing as well, and I could not tell who was a professional actor and who was a local being simply her or himself. Completely convincing are the scenes of life in the refugee camp and on the island. As another reviewer has mentioned, there's footage of tuna fishing as it was. For a glimpse of Stromboli today, see the 2003 miniseries ""The Best of Youth"".

Remarkable also is the film's frank, realistic attitude toward sex. Several scenes show husband and wife arguing, there's a cut, then the next scene implies they've had sex, which calms the tension for a while, until life brings more stress . . .  While this may not seem exceptional today, even ho-hum, Italian Neo-Realism brought to cinema this, well, reality. And further, it is implied that the wife's general unhappiness, discontent, is perhaps at least in part due to the husband's frequent absence. Sex as at least temporary relief from life's traps and boredoms has long been a part of Western literature, and cinema finally caught up.

That Bergman's character should attempt to wander off and over the volcano seems spontaneous and yet fitting, in line with all the preceding, and her final status seems an unforced, apt metaphor for Europe's predicament which gives the film a very broad relevance even today.",1358553600,2,1919,4.856269113149847

7900547,3,7885881512,"One of the best parts of the movie is an actual clip of Mattanza, the ancient blue fin tuna fishing.
Ingrid Bergman does a good job in the movie.  It is not a happy movie. From a historical perspective, it was interesting to see Sicilian villages and customs (not particularly endearing).  One of the other reviews gives a great overview of the movie.  I got what I wanted by buying this film and that was getting to see the Mattanza.",1309737600,3,434,4.4
