2257621,5,B0008ENHUS,"Decent re-mastering of Mr. McQueen's penultimate film. Enjoyable to see Billy Green Bush, Slim Pickens and Richard Farnsworth.  A timely view of corrupt capitalists exploiting evil for their own advancement, then resorting to more evil to resolve the conflicts created by their initial misdeeds.

2257630,5,B0008ENHUS,"I'm a fan of McQueen & Westerns.  This is a haunting elegy for both the 19th century cowboy & America's greatest star of the '60s & '70s.  While filming, he found out he had cancer, so he played Tom Horn with a sad resignation that will haunt you.",1503705600,,247,4.125

2257640,5,B0008ENHUS,"Strange how much I see characteristics of one in the other. Horn & McQueen. People have been making some mistakes
I think on Mcqueens last film (I think that was ""The Hunter,"" though I may be mistaken.)
 Where this took place out in that part of the country has been run by the railroad men and cattle-barons since the US began.
There is a Mormon influence behind many of these cattlemen, that is unsavory.
Tom Horn was framed by these no good SOB's,  and here is the quote in ref to his retrial & found innocent. This from Real Retrial;
""The word rang out like a gunshot in the crowded Cheyenne courtroom in September 1993, almost a hundred years after Tom Horns
hanging for first-degree murder.""",1495324800,,697,4.523809523809524

One can get in many spirited debates about the character of Horn, in the end I say don't depend on this movie for the truth. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a hell of a good western with one of the best actors to play this type of protagonist, look no further. It is very well done in almost all areas. McQueen's acting is at the top of his form, and actually, I can't say enough good things about it.

2257739,3,B0008ENHUS,"Tom Horn, 1980 film

This is the Hollywood history of Tom Horn. He was in Teddy Roosevelts Rough Riders that fought in the Spanish-American War, then went to Wyoming to work as a Range Detective (a man who stopped cattle thieves no questions asked). His horse is put in a stall by itself, Tom goes to a tavern. There is a discussion about boxing; Tom loses. He is hired by John Coble, a rancher. They stop to water their horses; some men play music until a gunshot ends this. Tom Horn is hired to eliminate cattle thieves. There is a feast with Maine lobsters. A big red bug? The cattlemen have a problem with missing cattle: thieves, the weather, overstocking, etc. The Association doesnt care if thieves are brought in or shot. The US Marshal explains things. Tom was a tracker who made a reputation for excellence.

Stock Detectives get a $200 bounty per rustler. This conversation never happened. Tom questions the validity of a bill of sale. Later he finds four men with a small herd of cattle. Three are stopped, the other will be a warning. Tom finds a barn where cattle are slaughtered. Two more men are stopped. Later Tom and others break in a horse. [Long shots for a stunt double.] Tom brings a horse for that schoolteacher; she rides well. Tom visits a small ranch, there is another shooting. In town a man shoots at him and misses; Tom doesnt. But this killing is witnessed. Is Horn too protective? Will his actions embarrass the big cattlemen? A young man watches his sheep until a shot knocks him over. A .45-60 bullet was used (Tom uses this cartridge). Tom is watched. The US Marshal plans to get Tom Horn in a terrible tangle. Tom talks to the lawman about a long shot. [Did he admit to anything?]

Armed men approach a tavern. Tom Horn is arrested for the murder of that 16-year old boy and put in jail. Did Tom Horn work for the Cattlemens Association? No comment. One rancher hires a lawyer for him, the trial will be soon. We see an earlier event where a man tried to kill him. Tom is warned about the trial, the prosecutor wants a conviction to advance his political career. The trial is a big event in town. National Guard soldiers are there for protection. Tom Horn does not do well on the stand. Back in jail Tom asks for his Indian charms. His attempt to escape fails when he cant get a horse! The jury says guilty, the judge awards a death sentence. Toms weight and height are measured. No one wants to pull the trapdoor so a mechanical device is used. A crowd of men gathers to watch the hanging. [The big social events of yesteryear.]

Was Tom Horn truly guilty or framed by the Cattlemens Association to get rid of an embarrassment? The use of ballistics could settle the question if the original bullet and rifle were available. [Unless the bullet was planted.] Range Detectives had a reputation for meanness; they got paid for every suspect caught or shot. For the background to this story read about the Johnson County War in 1890s Wyoming. This history inspired countless Western movies in the 1930s and 1940s; a cattle baron tried to get rid of small ranchers or homesteaders so he could steal their lands or water. The Open Range for ranching required a round-up to separate cattle. An un-branded calf became the property of the man who caught and branded it first. [The origin of that rodeo event of lassoing and tying calves.] Conflicts resulted in gunfire (as in those Frederic Remington paintings). In Montana un-branded calves became state property to pay taxes.",1428364800,,3504,4.583732057416268

Great cinematography and of course Steve McQueen is excellent in the title role. Sadly, his last.",1406505600,,262,4.717391304347826
2257901,4,B0008ENHUS,"When Steve McQueen was filming ""Tom Horn,"" his next-to-last movie, which was released in 1980, he was already suffering from the cancer that would kill him soon afterwards but had not yet been diagnosed. On some level, McQueen may have sensed his impending mortality, because he delivers a masterful, eerily insightful performance in a movie that never quite rises to the level of the lead performance.

The real Tom Horn was one of the Old West's most colorful characters, at one time an army scout, Spanish-American War volunteer, and Pinkerton detective. However, Horn, a crack shot with a rifle, was best known as a hired gun, working as a semi-official range detective for various business interests and protecting those interests in an often deadly fashion. The movie itself concentrates on the last few months of Horn's life in 2003, when he is hired by some Wyoming cattle companies to put an end to the widespread rustling that has decimated their herds. He does so primarily by gunning down any rustlers he finds. He makes one male friend, John Coble, a kindly cattleman played by Richard Farnsworth, who specialized in playing kindly characters, and one lady friend, the local school teacher played by Linda Evans.

Eventually, public sentiment turns against Horn as a result of the various killings, including a shootout on the city streets in which he defends himself against several hired killers. Horn's employers, with the exception of Coble, decide to cut their losses, and soon thereafter, a young boy tending a flock of sheep is gunned down from long range. Horn is a prime suspect, and he becomes the victim of a frontier wiretap, when the local marshal talks with him about the shooting while a reporter in the next room transcribes what Horn said, accidentally or deliberately garbling his written notes of Horn's statement to make it sound far more incriminating than it was. Based on this evidence, Horn is convicted and, eventually, hanged.

McQueen gives one of his best performances in ""Tom Horn,"" portraying him as a principled innocent, unable to adjust to the changing ways as the frontier lifestyle comes to an end. Early in the movie, he unknowingly insults Heavyweight boxing champion Jim Corbett, and willingly endures a beating he could have easily avoided. Later on, Horn always seems a bit bumbling, except when he's shooting his rifle. He's a man out of touch with reality, who's half aware of it but unable or unwilling to do anything about it. There's a lot of both sweetness and pain in the performance, which probably mirrored McQueen's real life emotions at the time.

""Tom Horn"" was a troubled production, going through numerous script rewrites from the original by noted author Thomas McGuane, and changes of director as well. TV director William Wiard is credited, but it's widely believed McQueen himself handled a good bit of the work. As a result, the movie never quite comes together. The first hour, up until Horn's arrest, is largely a disjointed set of scenes, some individually effective, but none of them really coalescing into a consistent story line. The movie also fails to use some great character actors like Billy Green Bush and Slim Pickens to best advantage.

After Horn's arrest, the movie picks up, highlighted by a bizarre trial in which Horn refuses to contradict or explain the incriminating statement he is alleged to have made despite the judge practically pleading with him to do so. Instead, he essentially stands on his character, asking the jury to judge him based on what they think of him. It's a spectacularly bad decision, and Horn's testimony sounds at times like the mumblings of a demented person, but it's an incredibly poignant and moving scene. And, of course, it seals his doom.

As a movie, ""Tom Horn"" has its moments but it's never the powerful story it should be. As an acting showcase for Steve McQueen, it's brilliant. McQueen elevates his material to a tragic heroic portrayal that succeeds far more because of his acting than of the way his role was written. As a result of his perceived cool image, Steve McQueen rarely got the acting credit he deserved. The coolness is gone in ""Tom Horn,"" but the brilliance remains. This performance is a fitting exclamation point to an exceptional acting career.",1406419200,,4292,4.945908460471567

2258049,3,B0008ENHUS,"I have become a fan of Steve McQueen and have been watching a different film nightly. TOM HORN was McQueen's second to last film. I've heard this was a pet project of his and it's sad that it is not a typical McQueen film. McQueen still shines on screen but he is looking older than his years and is moving a but more slower. Don't get me wrong. He's still Steve McQueen, but it is sad seeing this great actor as he was literally dying - whether or not he yet knew he was seriously ill.
The film begins as if it were a made for TV movie. The quality is lacking and then suddenly the beautiful Old West scenery comes to life in all of its splendor. Tom Horn is a historic figure and it's hard to tell if Horn is a man fighting cattle rustlers or is just out for blood. There is a lot of violence in this film and lots of scenes of horses being harmed. It's hard to watch for an animal-lover.
Pre-DYNASTY Linda Evans co-stars as Steve McQueen's love interest. Here she is looking natural and radiant without make-up. Her role seems to have been thrown in there and there is not interaction with McQueen's character.
McQueen was in his late 40's when this film was made yet he looks more aged than ever. Always ruggedly handsome, McQueen looks weaker and more tired in this film, yet, I believe he gave this film all of his energy.

2258056,5,B0008ENHUS,"I decided that today would be a fitting day to write the review for 'Tom Horn' and 'The Hunter' seeing as how today marks the 30th anniversary of Steve McQueen's untimely demise in Juarez, Mexico on November 7, 1980. Even more fitting in the fact these two cinematic gems were McQueen's final two finished movies both released just a few mere months before his passing. The premise of Tom Horn is one I can't help but to like: A phenomenal leading star in McQueen, a Wild Western setting replete with sweeping landscape visuals, impressive score, and a fascinating story of real Wild West hero that is part-biopic, part-love story, and part-legal drama. The result is an extremely well-produced and poignant, if elegaic, motion picture that I've been compelled to watch again and again. And, its drama is all the more potent due to the fact that its strange and nearly incomprehensible events are essentially true.

Legendary Hollywood screen icon Steve McQueen (who was also excutive producer here) gives a truly remarkable performance as the equally legendary Tom Horn, one of the Old West's lesser-known but most storied figures. For those unfamiliar with Tom Horn (as I was), he began as a Missouri farmboy with a love for the outdoors who became a master hunter and champion competitor of early rodeos. In the army cavalry he was a was a mule packer who ultimately fought in combat as a tracker and played a major role in the final surrender of Geronimo in the bloody Apache Wars. The film basically traces his final days from 1901-1903 when he made his indelible reputation as feared hired killer of cattle thieves. When we're first introduced to Tom in the film, it's apparent that his glory days are behind him, as he has been reduced to an aimless drifter and is evidently down on his luck. The Wild West he knew from two decades prior has become progressively more civilized, and fearless, pioneering gunmen like Tom are in demand (or aren't wanted) much any more. After arriving in the town of Cheyenne, Wyoming, he is recognized by wealthy cattle rancher John C.Coble (Richard Farnsworth)who meets Tom just after he's been roughed up off screen by a pompous pugilist and his gang of cronies who've picked a fight with him in a local bar. Out of admiration and also possibly pity, Coble offers Horn employment as a stock-detective (basically a legally-sanctioned killer) to scare off and drive away the growing problem of cattle rustlers which have plagued Coble and his fellow cattle associates. This allows for some truly spectacular chases across the plains and fierce gun battles as Horn methodically eliminates various rustlers one-by-one, juxtaposed in a genteel counterpoint with his gentle romance with a local schoolteacher (Linda Evans). The story takes an odd twist, however, when in the following year of 1902 Tom is bafflingly accused of the murder of a 14 year-old boy tending to his goats. This leads to a new passageway in the story that sets the stage for an early American legal drama in which Tom Horn is arrested, put up on trial and ultimately hanged on dubious charges one day before his 43rd birthday. We get the sense that Tom is innocent, but oddly enough we never actually hear him say so directly.

The screenplay abounds with questions, most of which director William Wiard wisely leaves open to the interpretation of the viewer. What possible reason could Tom have had for killing an innocent young goatherder? Why doesn't Tom ever directly deny the charges against him and vehemently proclaim his innocence? Was he suffering from some sort of mental fatigue from so many years of the West's early lawlessness? Why wouldn't the cattle ranchers simply inform Tom that his services as a stock detective were no longer required, rather than try to frame him for murder? (if they did) Why WOULD they try to frame him? And more importantly, why didn't Coble and others who knew Horn speak up for him more vociferously in his defense, even when Tom himself doesn't?

There's even a late scene in the film where Horn makes a short-lived escape from his jail cell in Cheyenne, making a mad dash for the hills. As Tom himself is advised in the movie, escaping from jail is not likely something that a truly innocent person would do. Was he really guilty and looking to escape the hangman's noose, or was he just merely so deliriously in love with the freedom of the wild, open plains that he sought to get back to them at any cost??? Whatever the case, we know at this point in the film that he isn't thinking clearly.

Most of the answers are likely lost forever to history and the true story of what really happened will probably never be known. We can also infer that the now-antiquated legal system of the early 20th century was also prone to many mistakes and flaws that left very wide margins for error and doubt.

But the dubious nature of the real-life historical account of Tom Horn in no way overshadows Steve McQueen's phenomenal performance, made even more amazing by the fact that he still managed to not only sell but BECOME the character, even at the point when his own health was declining. A remarkable western featuring an outstanding lead actor which effectively pays tribute to one of the West's unsung heroes. Still worth seeing today.

It almost leaves you depressed. Yet, I was glad to have finally seen this movie, and thought it was well worth the time.

This movie is SO Steve McQueen: a tough guy with few words, a likeble man (""Tom Horn,""the title character) who gets the job done no matter how tough the assignment; a guy the prettiest woman in town goes for and a man who gets respect of the good men in town. However, unlike many of his roles, the last 20-30 minutes reveals a totally unique character, and one that is puzzling.

Anyway, much of the film is a good western, nicely photographed and uniquely low-key. A pity this movie isn't better known, especially since it was McQueen's second-to-last film before dying of cancer. He looks different, too.

He grew up in the violence of the Old West. He became a cowboy, rode shotgun for the stage line, was an agent with the Pinkertons and fought with Rough Riders under Teddy Roosevelt. He made his reputation as a cavalry scout by bringing in Geronimo in the bloody Apache wars. In 1901, he made his to Wyoming Territory and this man name was Tom Horn. Tom is open country of Wyoming drinking coffee, and watching animals move on Wyoming Territory. Later in the day, Tom drifts into and drops his horse of at the stables. He tells the keeper to take care of his horse and if things go wrong, he'll sleep in the same stall as his horse. After getting into a fight, Tom wakes up in the same stall with his horse just like he said he would. Along comes John C Coble who's interested in hiring Tom for a special job. John Coble owns one of the biggest ranch in the Wyoming territory. Therefore, John offers Tom a good job and a place to put his head every night along with good meals to feel his stomach. Therefore, John and Tom start riding out of town when the stop at a local watering hole to give there horses a chance to drink some water. John lets Tom know that some of the cattle that are in the corral pen are his. After John gets of his horse some outlaws sitting on the porch start to play music and they want John to dance. However, John isn't interested in dancing so the outlaws start shooting at his feet. Tom starts shooting back and they booth ride off towards Cobles Ranch. The next day Tom starts his new job and later in the day, John introduces Tom to the Cattlemen Association. It turns out that John is a member of the Association and they want to hire John. After dinner Tom is introduce to Glendolene Kimmel who's the local school teacher. Tom is told that he's to do anything he has to get rid of the cattle rustlers that are plaguing the cattlemen's association. That brings me to some questions that need to be answered. Is Tom able to get the job done that the cattlemen's association wants him to do? Is the schoolteacher interested in Tom as Much as Tom is interested in the schoolteacher? Here are some personal thoughts of my own on the movie. I thought Steve McQueen was great in his role as Tom Horn. Some actors when they play a hero like Tom Horn let it go to their head and Steve McQueen was nowhere close to that. I do think that the movie could've used some more action in it but it wasn't bad they way it was. The reason I bought the movie was for Linda Evans. I was disappointed for time she received and I thought she deserved better.

2258084,5,B0008ENHUS,"Soldier, Indian tracker, lawman, outlaw, hired killer - there are about a half dozen movies that could be made about Tom Horn, so it's surprising that it wasn't until the Western was on its last legs that, aside from the odd fleeting appearance in B-movies, he finally made it to the big screen. In some ways it's amazing he made it at all. 1980's Tom Horn was a troubled picture, and that's putting it mildly. Sam Peckinpah was at one time tapped to direct, but he fell out with star and producer Steve McQueen before shooting started - possibly literally, since McQueen's alleged response to a furious argument they had in the car one evening led to McQueen insisting he get out without bothering to stop first. Neither Don Siegel nor Elliot Silverstein made it past pre-production. Electra Glide in Blue director James Guercio only lasted for the first three days of the shoot, and cinematographer John Alonzo and McQueen himself also had a hand in the finished film at one point or another, with credited director William Wiard apparently hired only to placate the Directors Guild when they wouldn't allow the star to direct himself. The screenplay went through many changes along the route as well, with Thomas McGuane's 450-page epic being constantly chipped away, Abraham Polonsky's rewrite being rejected and Bud Shrake's final script eventually alternating with McGuane's depending on which version the star felt like filming that day. And just to add to the good news, the picture suffered from major budget cuts due to studio politics and the threat of a William Goldman-scripted Robert Redford rival project (eventually made for TV with David Carradine as Mr Horn), shrinking from a three-hour $10m epic about the Indian tracker and interpreter's life to a $3m small-scale Western about its ignominious end.

Under such circumstances it would be wildly optimistic to expect the film to be even watchable, let alone great, but somehow it bucked the odds to come out as a bona fide forgotten classic. While there's no shortage of action in the first half of the movie - certainly enough for the studio to somewhat misleadingly sell it as an action movie - this is really a much more elegiac Western about the end of an era seen through the fate of a man out of his time and trapped by a reputation he cannot really live up to anymore. ""If you really knew how dirty and raggedy-***ed the Old West was, you wouldn't want any part of it,"" he tells Linda Evans schoolteacher, and the ailing McQueen makes no attempt to disguise just how raggedy he looks himself. When we first meet Horn it's not long before he's on the losing end of a fight with champion boxer"" Gentleman Jim"" Corbett, and after a brief and all-too successful career disposing of rustlers for the local Cattlemen's Association, soon finds himself set up for an even bigger fall when his ruthless efficiency becomes something of a public relations disaster for them.

Taking its lead from Horn's own autobiography, dictated while on trial for murder, there is an element of print the legend to it: whereas the real Horn was undone by his own egotism (his claim to have captured Geronimo seems largely fantasy, though he was one of the trackers involved in the campaign), McQueen's Horn is a simple man, modest, inarticulate, awkward in social situations and only really good at killing, which he regards simply as his job. But there's a striking lack of vanity to the performance, with McQueen not afraid to look a shrunken figure long past his prime - even his futile escape attempt feels almost half-hearted, something he feels he's expected to do, and there's a sense of acceptance of his impending death as he makes his inevitable way to the water-triggered gallows that he springs himself because nobody else wants to pull the lever on him.

(Curiously lawman Joe LeFors, whose dubious testimony sealed Horn's fate, is renamed LaSalle in the film, possibly because McQueen didn't want the audience to make any connections with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which was a one-time McQueen project that helped his rival Robert Redford become a superstar: McQueen certainly knew how to hold a grudge.)

The scars of the troubled production do sometimes show, not least in a flashback so abrupt everyone in the theatres thought they'd got the reels in the wrong order, but the strengths more than compensate, not least among them an effortlessly superb supporting performance from Richard Farnsworth, who manages to create a convincing onscreen bond with McQueen despite their off screen history (the young McQueen had got Farnsworth fired from Wanted: Dead or Alive when the veteran was still a stuntman). The cold, stark look of the film, it's town either muddy or snowbound, its ranges barren and desolate, and Ernest Gold's brooding score also catch the mood of impending death all too well. The Hunter may have been McQueen's last film, but in many ways this is the more fitting epitaph.

The only extras on Warners 2.35:1 widescreen transfer are the original theatrical trailer and a promo for Wanted: Dead or Alive.",1178409600,,5100,4.891329479768786

Farnsworth is excellent as Coble, Evans is true to the character of Glendolene Myrtle Kimmel, who was Horn's great champion, and Pickens is Pickens.

A frail McQueen plays the ""legendary"" Tom Horn, as a near-mythical heroic figure who lands in a small Western town. He is asked to clear up some trouble, honorably does so, and in the process is set up to take the fall for the townsfolk.

McQueen's performance is fine...he's clearly ill so you instinctively give him a bit of leeway.

The direction, however, is sloppy. It's unimaginative and pokey. Beautiful vistas yes, but the flashbacks are clumsy, many of the minor supporting actors are flat-out awful and the two-act structure makes for an awkward ending.

Farnsworth, however, is perfect. Linda Evans has some absolutely horrible lines, but is supposed to look dreamy, and does.

2258100,4,B0008ENHUS,"Steve McQueen is his pentultimate role before succumbing to cancer stars in the somber biographical film ""Tom Horn"". Horn, a legendary cowboy, Indian scout and wizard with a rifle rides his way into Wyoming territory near the turn of the 20th century.

Cattle rancher John Coble played in an effective measured fashion by western veteran Richard Farnsworth recognizes his talent and hires Horn to work on his ranch.  He introduces him to the local cattleman's association which was been plagued by rustling.  They give him free reign and backing by the local marshall Joe Belle to rid the territory of the cattle thieves by whatever means deemed appropriate including death.

The association soon tire of Horn's violent techniques and plan to get rid of him.  They railroad him without the backing of Farnsworth by accusing him of the murder of an innocent local youth who had been herding sheep.  A sham trial is convened to convict him of murder.

The story of ""Tom Horn"" is representative of the transformation in our country from the days of the old west.  Horn is symbolic of an era that no longer fits within the shrinking frontier.  Horn love interest, a school teacher played by Linda Evans also forsakes him unwilling to be seduced into his now obsolete violent lifestyle.  The movie serves as a sad commentary on society's unwillingness to allow freedom and equality for those that don't fit a prescribed mold in a changing world.

2258101,4,B0008ENHUS,"This review is for the Warner Brothers DVD released in 2005.

The movie is based on a true story.  Western cowboy Tom Horn (Steve McQueen) has a well-known reputation as fearless fighter for just causes.  The setting is circa 1901 in Wyoming and Horn rides into a small town.  After displaying his toughness in several confrontations, a local rancher named John Coble (Richard Farnsworth) hires Horn to stop a cattle-rustling problem that has been plaguing his ranch for sometime.  Horn agrees to work for him and carries out justice in his own way.  He does a great job for Coble - almost too good and then Horn is faced with a different set of problems.

The first hour of the movie is terrific with plenty of action and excitement.  It's a stunning visual presentation of Steve McQueen in a beautiful Western setting, playing a character who enforces the law his way with excitement and skill.  But then the last 35 minutes of the film is sedated and ambiguous when the story goes in a completely different direction.  Furthermore in this last segment, the character Tom Horn appears punchless and apathetic.  Since it is based on a true story, he may have really behaved this way, and that's fine, but that part of the story should have been condensed down to 3 or 5 minutes and stayed with the prior theme for a longer duration.  The film has plenty of merits, but the screen writing for the last part was poorly done and cripples the mood of the entire movie.

As for the DVD, it's a sharp and pristine widescreen color presentation. The audio is excellent.  Only two bonuses: the trailer and a `Wanted Dead or Alive' promotion.

2258102,4,B0008ENHUS,"""Tom Horn"" is a difficult film to watch at times knowing what we now know of the painful debilitating illness that star Steve McQueen suffered in his last years of life.  I recall at the time of the film's release it didn't get very good reviews but time has been kind to this film.  For starters, it's obvious that McQueen was in poor health when this film was made,particularly in the sequences that are more physically demanding.  He appears gaunt and fatigued.  They film him in shadowy lighting and in many cases it appears that doubles are employed.  It's in the latter half of the film, though, that McQueen's physical state adds dimension to his role.  The second half is devoted to Horn's circus trial for the murder of a boy.  The way Horn comported himself in the past made him a hero in the ""old"" west.  In the ""new"" west his methods are out-of-step and barbaric.  Horn seems resigned in the face of this acrimony to accept that he is a man out of time.  Though not quite of the same calibre this film brings to my mind John Wayne's final film, ""The Shootist"".  To appreciate this film I think one has to familiarize yourself with McQueen's essential work.  That said, this film stands as a fine elegy for a most outstanding career.",1122076800,,1244,4.504464285714286

2258104,4,B0008ENHUS,"This is a fine movie that was unfairly panned by critics.  There IS some clumsiness to it--the use of flashbacks towards the end doesn't work.  They seem as thought they were originally written and filmed to be an earlier part of the narrative and then placed at the end to keep the earlier part of the narrative going at the snappy, exciting pace it is in the final movie, and to add a little of that during the final part, which after Horn is arrested moves at a slower pace.

But the movie is still well-made, well-acted, and plenty entertaining. This is a revisionist western that doesn't downplay--well, doesn't downplay excessively--Horn's stature as a killer of men.  In the movie, Horn isn't reluctant to fire the first shot, or to keep shooting after a man is down.  When one of the cattle rustlers tries to ambush him in town, for example, Horn shoots him and as the man is lying in the mud, probably mortally wounded, Horn unnecessarily shoots him again. In the film, it is this incident that moves the cattlemen who employ him to sell him out.

Horn comes off as something of a hapless, easily-manipulated rube in the movie--which it seems very unlikely he could have been and still be as cagey as he was. He's an idiot savant, of sorts, a man remarkably gifted when it comes to killing people, but inept at living in the civilized world. When he learns that he is being accused of killing the Nickell boy, not only does he diligently avoid proclaiming his own innocence, he goes out of his way at his own trial to annoy everyone and cast even more suspicion on himself.

We remain sympathetic to Horn, though.  When we see him kill, he's always killing men much, much worse than himself.  The world is not a worse place for their departure.  And he's a helluva shot.  We Americans love a great shot!",1117843200,,1812,4.52760736196319
2258105,5,B0008ENHUS,"It goes without saying, really, that TOM HORN is one of Steve McQueen's greatest roles.  More importantly, others in the movie industry and especially with the Western genre agree.  In the June 2001 issue of COWBOYS & INDIANS magazine, when asked what he thought were the best ten Western movies of all time, Tommy Lee Jones named TOM HORN as one of the ten.  And, given his experience with such Western classics as LONESOME DOVE and THE GOOD OLD BOYS, I think that most aficionados of Western films would agree with Mr. Jones' assessment.  I certainly do.

A classic western, TOM HORN is a must for any serious western movie library. The movie tracks Horn from the Southwest into Wyoming and a career as a ""stock detective."" The career begins promisingly enough but soon takes a downward turn as Horn, the simple cowboy and tracker, runs head on into big business politics and scandals that jeopardize not only his freedom but also his life.

In addition to McQueen, a superstar cast includes Slim Pickens (The Cowboys), Linda Evans (Dynasty), Billy Green Bush (Lee Marvin's Monty Walsh) and Richard Farnsworth (The Grey Fox).

It's likely that the debate about Tom Horn, the way he lived and, especially, the way he died-points very masterfully put forth in the film-will continue for years to come.  There should be, however, no debate about this wonderful film.

The character is real. A hero of the war against the Apaches, he more or less survived in the west till he found a job with some cattle ranchers in Wyoming. He did what he was hired to do : he got rid of cattle-thieves. But finally his radical method in a world where the press started looking west were no longer acceptable by those who hired him. So they trapped him into a murder case : a child mind you. And he goes through it without the slightest sign of emotion. The film is a sad commentary on what the west became when it was completely open and conquered. The law arrived and crime along with it and no way to fight against it, or against them, both the law and crime. The survivors from  the time of the wild west had to go away, recycle themselves or be put to sleep nicely or more violently. There was no reform school for ex-western vigilantes. It is pathetic to see the end of a period and the death of its heroes. This has always happened and the wild west is nothing but a dream today though some of its methods have been transposed into normal life and we do have some wild west adventurers among us. Mankind needs a frontier to develop and there is always a place where the law will not apply, a place beyond the very limits of lawfulness, even in the very heart and midst of our daily life.

2258107,5,B0008ENHUS,"This is my favorite McQueen film of all time. Not only a western, but is also a true story of a man who has come to a point in his life where he has done it all. He then comes to Wyoming and is hired to help with cattle rustling and is soon engulfed in an all out war with rustlers. Using his trusty rifle Tom uses violence as a way of dealing with them and soon then is framed for a murder and pays the ultimate price. His life. McQueen is perfect in this film. This movie is long overdue for DVD and I am extremely happy that they have finally set a date for it. End of May cannot get here fast enough.",1111881600,,604,3.84
2258108,4,B0008ENHUS,"Tom Horn is a very good western along the lines of The Wild Bunch about the changing times in the west and how certain people are adjusting to it.  Based on a true story, the movie is about fronteirsman and marksman Tom Horn.  Famous for several reasons that are introduced early in the movie, Horn begins the movie drifting along in 1903 Wyoming.  Known for his ability with a rifle, Horn is hired by an association of ranchers to drive out rustlers in whatever way necessary.  Soon, he begins to call too much attention to himself causing the ranchers to take action.  This movie is very good for several reasons.  It seems very realistic with beautiful scenery, good characters(good and bad), and a well-told story.
  Steve McQueen gives a very believable performance as frontier hero, Tom Horn.  His role as a man caught in a changing world who is not willing to change along with it is very well done.  Richard Farnsworth plays rancher John Coble, one of the only men to remain loyal to Horn even when he is in trouble.  Linda Evans gives a good, if somewhat short, performance as Gwendolene, a schoolteacher who Tom falls in love with.  Slim Pickens is excellent as the sheriff who knows Tom from the past, but we never learn in what way.  There are several other recongizable faces here, but their names escape, most notably the deputy who was a regular in John Wayne movies.  I really hope they put this movie on DVD since it is vastly underrated as a western.  Fans of McQueen will absolutely love Tom Horn even if it is not the most uplifting of movies.",1061769600,,1563,4.551971326164875
2258109,3,B0008ENHUS,"I SAW THIS MOVIE IN WIDE SCREEN LETTER BOX FORMAT WHEN IT PREMIERED IN MARCH OF 1980. I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND LOVED IT.
IT IS STILL KIND OF A CULT CLASSIC. IT IS A STRETCH THOUGH FROM THE WAY THINGS ACTUALLY OCCURRED. ENTHUSED BY THE FILM I BEGAN RESEARCHING ""TOM HORN.""
I THINK MCQUEEN WAS MISCAST AS HORN. HE WAS THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND IT WAS HIS FILM, BUT SOMEONE LIKE ROBERT DUVALL, DENNIS WEAVER OR SAM ELLIOTT WOULD HAVE PHYSICALLY BEEN A MORE IDEAL CHOICE.
FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT IN THE FILM HORN USES A WINCHESTER 1876 .45-60 RIFLE. IN REALITY HORN USED A WINCHESTER 94 IN .30-30 WHICH WAS A NEWLY INTRODUCED SMOKELESS CARTRIDGE AND THE HIGH PERFORMER OF THE DAY. I GUESS .30-30 DIDNT RING WITH MAGNUM FLARE IN 1980.
SOME OF THE BIT PARTS IN THE FILM WERE PLAYED BY STUNTMEN WHICH IS A COMMON PRACTICE. BUT THE ACTING SUFFERED AS A RESULT.
A LOT OF NAMES WERE CHANGED. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A ""RIGHTS"" THING AND ISNT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.
HORN WAS A LOT MORE TALKATIVE AND BOISTROUS IN REAL LIFE THAN THE MCQUEEN TACITURN STYLE.
IN THE MOVIE HORN GIVES EVERYONE A FAIR CHANCE AND KILLS THE BAD GUYS IN STAND UP FIGHTS. IN REALITY HORN WAS BASICLY A SNIPER WHO KILLED FROM AMBUSH. A TRUE ""DRY GULCHER.""
DONT GET ME WRONG I LIKE THE MOVIE AND IT DOES VERY WELL FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF OF GOOD SHOOT EM UP ACTION WESTERN. I JUST THINK IT SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A CREATIVE QUASI-FACT PARTLY FICTION FILM.
IT ENTERTAINS NICELY ITS JUST MORE STEVE MCQUEEN THAN TOM HORN.",1043107200,,1471,4.294964028776978
2258110,5,B0008ENHUS,"Tom Horn is one of the best westerns ever made and probably Steve McQueen's best film. McQueen gives a performance that deserves a best actor award in my view. The movie is based on Tom Horn's later years that take place from 1901 to his death in 1903. In that time period Horn is hired as a stock detective to rid Wyoming of cattle rustlers. But when Horn gets rid of alot of the rustlers, the people that hired him want to get rid of him so they frame him for a murder of a teenage boy and Horn is arested and put on trial. This was Steve McQueen's next to last movie before dying of cancer. His next film was The Hunter and it's a very good film also. Rated R for some graphic violence and language.",1007078400,,702,4.094202898550725
2258111,4,B0008ENHUS,"Knowing that Steve McQueen's health was deteriorating rapidly as this film was being made gives Tom Horn an added sadness. The story itself, of a slightly over-the-hill former frontiersman turned hired gun, framed for a murder he is innocent of, is engrossing. The viewer emapthises with the character of Tom Horn thanks to McQueen's superb understated performance. McQueen could achieve so much with a glance; as an actor he was most effective when he was quiet - he could deliver a great performance in a restrained manner, without hitting the audience over the head with unnecessary speeches or physical stunts. That's the sign of a quality actor. McQueen's failing health is largely hidden. He looks tired at times, which could be excused by his age (50), and avoids pity through the strength of his performance. Tom Horn was his penultimate film (the routine action movie The Hunter being his last) and was his last chance to take part in a high quality production. He didn't disappoint.",997488000,,992,4.981927710843373
2258112,5,B0008ENHUS,"One of the final few movies Steve McQueen (along with the little watched  film version of Ibsen's ""An Enemy Of The People"") made before  succumbing to cancer was this fine and under appreciated movie based on the  historical facts surrounding the exploits, exploitation, trial and hanging  of a man who wound up being the comparatively innocent ""fall guy"" caught in  the middle of a number of clashing and rapidly changing social institutions  of the American West.  Horn is a gunman, drifter and marksman with a  considerable reputation, and when he moseys into town the cattle ranchers  see him as the key to their otherwise insoluble problems in settling their  long-standing dispute with the sheepherders. Tom rids them of their  problems, and in doing so is neatly set up to take the fall for a murder he  didn't commit. Yet for the sake of everyone but Horn, convicting him makes  considerable sense. Thus, he is railroaded, and he never stands a chance of  exoneration.
This is a wonderful if disturbing true story well told, and  the cast is absolutely superb and on-key with tone-perfect minimalist  acting that avoids being coy or too traditional, and McQueen, for all his  health problems, delivers a bravura performance as a man caught by time and  circumstance in a world he neither understands nor appreciates, and he does  a wonderful job in conveying the stoical resignation with which this simple  man accepts his unfair fate with dignity and maturity. The cinematography  is absolutely breath-taking, and the size and grandeur of the surrounding  scenery helps the viewer to understand just how significantly the small  people like Tom Horn were in wresting the West from the wilderness it was  to become part of so-called civilized and ""citified"" America. This is one  you don't want to miss.  Enjoy!",965433600,,1819,5.0
2258113,5,B0008ENHUS,"A dramatization based on the true story of a legendary frontiersman, ""Tom Horn"" depicts the final years in the life of this tracker, interpreter and hero of the Apache Wars.  Steve McQueen portrays Horn, who drifts into  Wyoming Territory in 1901.  There he makes the acquaintance of cattle  rancher John Coble (Richard Farnsworth), who brings Horn's presence to the  attention of the ""Cattlemen's Association.""  There's been an ongoing  problem with rustlers, not to mention the encroachment of sheep ranchers,  and the association has been endeavoring to find a solution.  In Horn,  whose reputation precedes him, they see the answer to their problems, much  to the consternation of Marshall Joe Belle (Billy Green Bush), who feels  slighted in the matter; his ego, it seems, is even more pronounced than his  own reputation.  They hire Horn as a ""Stock Detective,"" and give him free  rein as to how he must deal with cattle rustlers; whether to shoot, or  bring them in, is entirely up to him.  In little more than a year's time,  the rustling has stopped; Horn has done his job well.  Too well, in fact.  It seems that he's become a bit too ""high profile,"" and after an incident  in town, during which Horn kills a man in self defense, the members of the  association, as well as Joe Belle, conclude that Horn is now their biggest  problem.  The last thing they want is to have their names appearing in  newspapers, connecting them in any way with Horn or any of the recent  killings.  They want to be rid of him, and for good, but they don't know  how to go about it.  Soon thereafter, on one of the nearby sheep ranches, a  fifteen-year-old boy is shot and killed in cold blood, by a rifle shot from  a distance of two hundred and thirteen yards.  Though an obvious set-up,  Horn is subsequently arrested, and put on trial, for the murder of the boy.  McQueen gives a performance here that is nothing less than  remarkable.  He deftly captures the essence of the rugged, loner cowboy,  with a subtle, somewhat subdued approach that gives total credibility to  his character.  Horn is a cowboy, a product of the old west who has spent a  lifetime killing and avoiding being killed, and like so many others of his  time, is merely trying to adapt to a new century, a new era.  Just another  guy looking for work; and this is the Tom Horn that McQueen delivers to the  screen, perceptively avoiding any feigned heroics or superfluous  contrivances that would have given him that sense of being  larger-than-life.  His Tom Horn is a proud man, without being steeped in  ego; and it's that down-to-earth attitude that makes him real, and gives  distinction to this film.  Director William Wiard does an exceptional  job of formulating an appropriate atmosphere, and maintaining it throughout  the film, which underscores the stoic nature of the story.  He's made a  pensive, penetrating western, realistically integrating the necessary  violence into the natural fabric of the story.  There's nothing gratuitous  here; another aspect for which Wiard should be commended, because it adds  even more to the impact of the climax.  With an excellent supporting cast  which includes Linda Evans (Glendolene), Slim Pickens (Sam), Roy Jenson  (Mendenhour) and Geoffrey Lewis (Walter Stoll), ""Tom Horn"" is an honest  study of life during an era of change; of the politics and prevailing  attitudes that contributed to the shaping of a new century.  And of the  individuals, who in the final analysis, made a difference.",960854400,,3512,4.863945578231292
2258114,5,B0008ENHUS,"Steve McQueen's second to last film, ""Tom Horn,"" is an unjustly overlooked masterpiece with one of the actor's best and most moving performances.

As the famed scout whose skills seem threatening and out of place in an Old West that is gradually moving  into a more modern era, McQueen is poignant and quietly dignified. His  performance here shows that he could convey more with his eyes than most actors could with a long-winded speech out of Shakespeare. Knowing that the star was fatally ill during production adds to the film's melancholy mood.

This is also a beautiful film visually with stunning cinematography. Ernest Gold's powerful music score should also be noted.

Highly recommended, and an absolute must for McQueen admirers.

McQueen spent over a year preparing for this portrayal, and it shows.  He is able to capture the  essence of the cowboy of the old west, warts and all.  The reality that the  old life is gone as the ranges are closed, hits Tom with brutal force  toward the end of the movie.  This is a story that is bigger than one man.  We see America, first young and adventurous, now growing older and more  cautious.  There is no place for a man like Horn.

8055711,3,B0008ENHUS,"Steve McQueen was my favorite actor.  I was 20 years old when this came out.  I was excited because he hadn't had a movie in the theater's since The Towering Inferno.  After I watched it I thought it was o.k.  It wasn't one of his best movies.  Then later when he revealed he had cancer qaqnd died not too long afterwards.  There are things you notice in the movie that I didn't notice before.  Like when he kneels over his horse afer it had been shot.  How bad his face looks.
The first half of the movie is pretty good as he starts killing cattle rustlers which he was hired to do.  And looking back if the real Tom Horn would have know how that was going to turn out.  When they offered him the job.  He should have just rode out then.  The second half of the movie after he is framed and goes to jail and then on trial is slow and not as good.  I have one question.  When he was hanged noone wanted to be the one to spring the trap door.  So why was anyone willing to pour the water that would spring the trap door.",1522886400,,1019,4.0
