8511810,5,B0077PBPPA,"What does hunting and killing have to do with anatomy, evolutionary biology, physiology, and comparisons between aspects of these subjects and the animal's behavior ?  Nothing very much was left out by omitting the ' hunt ' ( if it could correctly be called a hunt ).  What is being done in this case (Burmese Pythons) is more like a "" culling "" than hunting.

Also, there (regrettably) are virtually None, if any 10th grade classes where anatomy and the other subjects are discussed, let alone actually done.  These videos are at an educational level much, much higher than the sophomore high school level, but there is no more 'Latin' than required, and it's accessible to those with only basic education in the subject.  The genius of these videos is primarily because of the scope of the videos and the variations of the types of animals.

If there is any criticism, then it should be the low resolution (especially of the broadcast) of the videos themselves.  The discs should have been produced at 1920 x 1080 progressive (no more interlaced video please ! ), both in 'blu ray' and at a lower cost for those who don't wish to spend as much, DVD's.

C'mon PBS -  it's practically 2015 !  We have ""Ultra HDTV"" now...  wake up and fill the bandwidth !!",1413331200,,1255,4.608108108108108
8511811,1,B0077PBPPA,"I LOVE documentaries , and this one was HORRIBLE .
All it was , was a few people that went into the jungle and captured 2 large Burmese Pythons ( and they showed NONE of the hunt for the snakes - which would have been cool ) . NONE .  They just suddenly had 2 pythons (already killed) , and started to dissect them - ""this is the spleen"" .........""these are all the vertebrae"" ....................it SUCKED .  I felt like i was in my 10th grade biology class again .................",1394668800,,482,4.344444444444444
8511812,5,B0077PBPPA,"The DVD was in perfect condition. Excellent documentary. Very educational, we can watch it many times.
I will definitely buy another video again.",1375574400,,145,5.3478260869565215
8511813,5,B0077PBPPA,"I bought this for my HS EnSci class.  It was wonderful!  Covers the problems of invasive species, reviews some AnPhys, all in an evolutionary framework.  Really illustrated the Systems approach to Biology.  Highly recommend!",1371513600,,224,5.5
8511814,5,B0077PBPPA,"Fantastic! The team catches a Burmese Python in Florida (an escaped invasive species) and allows us to watch the dissection. Very interesting material!!! As the dissection unfolds we get to see close-ups of an array of structures and get functional and evolutionary explanations for their existence. The film also includes other segments about snakes and pythons in intervals during the dissection: a treasure chest with interesting information. Definitely a learning experience and a ""must"" if you are at all interested in the natural history of snakes.  The whole series ""Inside Giants"" is alluring in its approach.",1340668800,2,617,5.427083333333333
