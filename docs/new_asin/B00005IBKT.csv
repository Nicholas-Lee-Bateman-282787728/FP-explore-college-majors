There are some scenes that stand out but at the moment I can't remember them except for the scene where Elsie (La Wanda Page -AKA- Aunt Esther) gets spooked & leaves. In my opinion (Also I'm a BIG fan of Sanford & Son) was the funniest & best scene of the movie. Mausoleum has some scenes that will probably make you laugh out loud, some that will make you go oh my God & some scenes that will make you go are you serious but most of all, Mausoleum is a movie that you will probably enjoy if you truly enjoy bad movies or bad horror movies",1432080000,,606,4.058333333333334
7938417,3,B00005IBKT,"Well hmm this movie was okay and that's really the only positive thing I can say about it.

I did like the housekeeper the only smart person in the movie and the deaths were pretty graphic for the 80's.

The story however was ridiculous stupid and confusing.

The way the movie looked was also really bad for the most part it looked more like it was filmed in the 70s instead of the 80's.

There were some genuinely creepy parts and some of the special effects were not half bad the rest were hilariously bad.

I also added another star because of this gorgeous blond guy in the film at a bar he played Grizzly Adams years ago and suffice it too say he was a hunk back then in the prime of his life.

Seeing him was a bonus but the movie itself was a real letdown too say the least.

Oh and the husband in the film has got too be one of the dumbest people in the entire film. So clueless .",1415836800,,889,4.045714285714285

7938420,3,B00005IBKT,I could not see this since I purchased a region two DVD that I was not informed of beforehand.however I saw it on VHS years back and I like its erotic humor and horror. Rarewaves has lost my business because of not specifying about their DVD region codes. Unlike Oxford sales who do. Corey Davis,1364256000,2,295,4.381818181818182

7938424,5,B00005IBKT,"we'll this movie is worth seeing just for the housekeeper. she's so funny in her character and what she say's in one scene is worth the whole experience of watching it.

 it's a little known ""B"" movie from the 80's and recently released on dvd. there was a whole string of horror movies made around the same time, each has it's own little appeal.

 i can't say it's the best horror movie ever but it's worth a viewing. i've seen better and i've definitely seen worse. give it a watch and see for yourself. enjoy.
