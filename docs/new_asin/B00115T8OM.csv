8240642,3,B00115T8OM,"This appears to be a cut down version of the longer series, but it's hard to tell.  Low budget, silly, somewhat incoherent and filled with strange (that's not bad, mind you) subtitles.  Interesting for it's incoherence.  Put it on when you just want to feel adrift.  Wire-fu not so good;  like I say very low budget.  When all is said and done, can't really recommend this.",1237593600,,373,4.575757575757576
