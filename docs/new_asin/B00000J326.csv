7911905,5,B00000J326,"This program gets into the core of Arthur's work, demonstrating many of the techniques necessary to become consciously aware at all times. It is not only practically relevant, but quite spiritual as well. The beauty of Arthur's work is that he combines both of these elements into a 7-minute a day warm up that definitely works. I warm up my Voice every day using these techniques and the benefits are immeasurable! Vocal Awareness has helped me increase sales in my job by being a more focused and confident communicator! It takes work to get there, however, the benefits are astounding! I wish more people would realize the power they have hidden inside them. Arthur's program is the key to harnessing this power. I have also attended many of Arthur's live seminars and his Work is ""Life-Changing!""",1380067200,2,800,4.889705882352941
7911906,1,B00000J326,"I have never been so disappointed in a training video. My job involves consulting and teaching and by the end of the day my voice can end up raspy. I had hoped to find techniques or excercises that would help. Instead I found that before speaking I should say, ""thank you to my source"" and surrender to the infinite, then ""surrender to the power within"". I was left to ponder unqualified statements such as, ""voice is the only artistic experience which is finite and infinite at the same time"".
I don't mean to put down the spirituality that is presented here. In my college days I took yoga and meditation classes that covered very similar ground and I enjoyed them. I just want people to be aware that this is the focus of the video. If that part were removed, there would be little left. The actual voice excercises could be demonstrated in five minutes.
Finally, I recommend researching these techniques before buying to see if any scientific research shows that they are effective. I have a great deal of difficulty believing that hanging onto your tongue with a washcloth while singing will improve your voice. It's easy to get people to write testimonials to almost anything (see Joseph's web page for examples) but getting results in a scientifically controlled study is another matter.",977875200,33,1294,4.78125
7911907,5,B00000J326,"I have had the pleasure of attending Arthur's one-day and five-day workshops. This video captures the essence of his phenomenal, spiritual approach. During the workshops, other attendees often gasp in amazement  when they hear the ""after"" voice of someone following a simple,  short exercise. You may find yourself emotionally moved after following the  techniques in this video, and realizing that you really DO have wonderful  speaking AND singing voices. I bought this video in the year between the  two workshops to remind me of his 12 rituals and 7-minute exercises. You  will find all of that and more on this video! Arthur says that everyone  will notice a significant improvement in their voices after only 1 week of  his program. The 7-minutes are easily incorporated into the rest of each  morning's rituals.",958608000,11,818,5.136363636363637
