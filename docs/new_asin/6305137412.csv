7883661,5,6305137412,I don't own this VHS. I saw this animation story 1950s in Japan. The memory remained in me and look for the revival. I'm afraid this video is not that. I wish I can have a glimpse of it.,1204156800,,186,3.7948717948717947
7883662,2,6305137412,"I was so excited to finally get a copy of Ivan and His Magic Pony on DVD, but ended up disappointed.  I own the original on VHS and the DVD does not do it justice.  Yes, the animation is the same but the dialog has changed.  The songs alone are very different.  I wish someone would just make a DVD version that is not different from the original.  A childhood dream ruined.",1102377600,6,374,4.138888888888889
7883663,5,6305137412,"Yes, all the videos in this series are fantastic, but Ivan and his Magic Pony really stands out. I first owned this work of art on the now extinct CED video collection in the very early 80's. I was thrilled to finally find it on VHS.
The movie itself is just beautiful. The animation has a unique style that is very pleasing and calming. You can call Disney movies ""classic"" all you want, but these films from Russia truly deserve that title.
Ivan and his Magic Pony is about just that. Ivan and his two older brothers set out to the hay fields to catch whoever has been stealing their hay. The thief turns out to be a magic horse who grants 3 gifts to Ivan since the horse cannot shake him off. Ivan is granted 2 grand horses and 1 pony who can talk. Ivan sells the 2 horses to the Czar and is given the job of heading up the stables. Ivan then goes on a few fantastic adventures appointed by the Czar. I don't want to spoil the rest because you just have to see the film to truly appreciate it.
All the CGI and multi-million dollar animation in the world could never stand up to this movie or some other rare ones that have been lost through the passage of time, i.e. The Mouse and His Child.",1024531200,5,1194,4.1731601731601735
7883664,5,6305137412,"Wow, this brings back memories.  This movie is really remarkable, and has the feel of old folklore that Disney has yet to figure out.  It is really different, and will thoroughly entertain anyone under the age of seven (maybe older).  It's been a while since I've seen it, so I can't remember if the acting and script are cheesy, but I do remember that it was visually beautiful and fun to watch.",987811200,3,396,4.472222222222222
7883665,5,6305137412,"I am the mother of a 4yr. old and i am collecting the ""Stories from my childhood"" series, and each and every one is a work of art with wonderful, meaningful stories. A great option for parents who are tired of  the average Disney fare and want truly wonderful classics for their  children.",943574400,5,289,4.433962264150943
