8014967,5,B0001N6QCW,I loved it  because being a senior it was a slow exercise and I could do as many as I want. I do believe it exercises every part of the body. I had an older version of this dvd on a video tape and used it a lot. I hope to get back into a routine.,1459036800,,246,3.392857142857143
8014968,3,B0001N6QCW,"The title of this tape is deceptive.  It is more than just a stretching tape, it is definitely an exercise tape, including situps, pushups, bicycles, and other things that might be difficult for a senior to do.  I just turned 60 and I found it difficult to do all the reps on most of the exercises, and there were a few that I could not do at all.  I would not recommend this tape for an out of shape senior.",1118102400,14,408,4.075
