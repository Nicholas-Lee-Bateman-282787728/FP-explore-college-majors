8085276,3,B000BD2HNY,"This is a only a fair overview of the events of World Youth Day 1993, held in Denver Colorado.  At 60 minutes it's just too short to be more than that - an overview.  There is not nearly enough footage of Pope John Paul II and even less of his words except in very brief clips.  Rather a disappointment as I was looking for something more in depth.",1200096000,2,348,4.088235294117647
