1247471,3,B00001YXCD,"Make no mistake this is not Johnny Mnemonic or the Matrix in any way.  While the story may come from Cyberpunk Guru William Gibson, there is almost no tech to be had in this film.
That being said, the film is very  true to the source, and it's languid and impressionistic style makes it  perhaps the most literary of the works inspired by WG.
The movie is slow  and a lot of it is tedious, but that may be because the real story here  only occurs in the final act, the whole rest of the film being the  back-story.
Its an interesting approach though not completely satisfying,  but in a story about loss, self-doubt and paranoia, nothing really should  be.",945302400,8,656,4.408333333333333

They seem to be MUCH more accurate and honest. From now on, that will be my game plan. I thought a movie with Christopher Walken and Willem Dafoe couldn't miss, at the VERY LEAST it would be tolerable. There is NO OTHER explanation than, THIS MOVIE STUNK TO HIGH HEAVEN!!!!!  Most scenes looked like they were filmed with the light of a 50w light bulb. The sound quality was terrible and the acting ( or should I say lack of ) was poor. Save your money and time and pass on this mess, you'll be happy you did. Those reviewer's that give 5 star ratings and write 6 or 7 profound paragraph's on how artistic this movie is, must be writing reviews in a rubber room.",1363564800,,826,4.227848101265823

1247475,5,B00001YXCD,"There are many clues in the visuals and dialogue, they suggest that New rose hotel is about a computer ""Fox"" working for ""maas/mass"" trying to take information from another ""super"" computer named Hiroshi, to do so Rom=Fox+X=Ram concoct and send a virus Sandy to collect it, or take it over.
Fox, perhaps a salvaged repaired hard drive with some interesting information on it, while its other part, its Ram/X has an exceptional connection to the internet. When fox and x meet they always touch briefly, making a connection.
Removing ""F""(F=Face) from Fox leaves ""ox"" or  o's and x's

Through its connections X touches everything around him, while Rom can only look but not touch. Even the japanese sex programs X enjoys in their shared hotel room, fox can only watch and repeat the phrase ""Get over here"". Even the ones sent by maas to shut him down never touch him, while X is involved in some low level upgrade to his appearance, Fox flies off the balcony on his own power.

1247476,3,B00001YXCD,Love the cast. Love the author. Def love the genre. Was painful to watch at times. pacing bad. dialog bleh. camera angles annoyed me at times. Happens and glad I didn't pay full price to have experienced this.,1321315200,,209,4.526315789473684
1247477,1,B00001YXCD,"This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  In fact, it's literally used up my crappy movie quota for the entire next year and maybe the year beyond that.  There's a number of issues on why this movie is so unfathomably bad.
- For one, the entire budget apparently was spent getting actors Christopher Walkin and William Dafoe.  So, everything else was done on a shoestring.  This is not of itself bad.  But the money was clearly not used wisely.  Which means they have a number of scenes that break the cardinal rule of movies which is show it, don't say it.
- Main characters, whose acting is also equally bad to the production values, spend time in scenes talking about what they're doing, have done, and will do, rather than using any sense of cinematography to *show* the viewer.
- The guy the main characters are ""attacking"" never appears in the movie outside them watching a few quick scenes of him in surveillance videos.  Again, this would be fine if the videos gave any sense of the character at all.  Such brilliant lines are uttered like ""Look at him.  He's a genius"" in response to a 3 second video of an asian man flipping over a circuit board the same as a chimp in a cage would flip over a rock.  Your pet dog could come up with better dialog than this.
- There's virtually no direction at all.  This movie attempts to appear both gritty and noire at the same time and manages to fail at both.  There's a bunch of scenes of the wet street after rain and blacked out characters running in front of a light source.  This should, in theory, look cool and art-deco, but it just ends up looking like a 12-year old produced this with his mom's VHS video recorder for a Jr High School class.
- William Gibson is an interesting writer, but his movies have never translated well to film.  Johny Neumonic was a pretty lackluster film, but looks amazing in comparison to this.  The story here is likely to go over a lot of normal people's heads, but given the crowd that would be attracted to this movie to begin with (scifi fans), it is likely to end up insulting the target audience quite a bit through wasting their time and mental prowess through poor quality, horribly wooden acting, and transparent and shallow plot.

If you're considering this movie I suggest going for a walk and thinking a bit or going fishing instead.  There's far more intellectual grit to be had via these activities over wasting your valuable time with movies like this that should seriously be banished off the face of the earth and hidden from alien species in case they ever land here for fear of what they may think of the human species for nonsense such as this.",1306540800,8,2658,4.469979296066253
1247478,4,B00001YXCD,"I have real mixed feelings about this one.  It's very strong in some aspects and very weak in others.  I still enjoyed the movie (would really give it 3.5 stars though), but at the same, I'm not sure I could recommend it to anyone who's not a fan of William Gibson.

First of all, I think the film did a pretty good job of realizing the story.  The characterization, dialogue, plot, themes and tone were pretty well represented for me.  The tricky thing here is that the story is about 15 pages long and takes place entirely in a Tokyo Capsule Hotel, with the protagonist in a state of utter despair and ennui as he starts piecing together what went wrong through a series of flashbacks, all the while knowing that his time left is slipping away.  Granted, that's not really going to flesh out a 90 minute feature, so I was willing to accept the way it's presented.  Sometimes you have to make concessions when a book is filmed, and overall I don't think any of this compromised the integrity.

The acting was great, and they had some great dialogue to work with.  Walken and Dafoe are as superb as you'd expect.  One of the film's best strengths is the noiry con-man banter between the two.  Honestly I didn't know much about Asia Argento (I kind of assumed she was Dario's daughter, and cynically thought, ""great, nepotism from a B-movie zombie guy"") but she really held her own with these two heavy-weights, really well for a young lady whose first language is not English.  I didn't need any convincing that she could seduce anyone certainly, and it doesn't hurt that she's half naked a lot of the time.  Not a fan of that tattoo though, too tacky for me.

The plot might be a bit inaccessible for some.  In some ways it's very slow, there's not a lot of action, or when there is, we don't necessarily see it.  A Gibson fan would feel right at home with a premise involving the corporate espionage between MAAS and Hosaka.  But for someone walking in cold, it might be a bit hard to grasp the different forces at play.  Even having read the story, some of the indirect action took place on one character's PDA - which was monochrome and small, making me question - who is this, where are they and what's going on?

The budget on the movie was obviously not great, but again, I was OK with this aspect in some respects, but turned off by others.  This movie is very low-tech by Gibson's standards, but his appeal for me is not in sci-fi gimmicks, but the social effects of these mechanisms.  That didn't bother me, if anything it helps, because visual tekkie effects usually don't age well.  What did kind of turn me off, the movie takes place in Tokyo, Marakesh and Europe, but each time they changed locales, they'd show just some stock footage video of the city and then dump you in some generic hotel or restaurant.  Sorry but it was not only unconvincing, but detracting since it kept screaming to me ""I am a low budget movie!""

Love the story, love the acting, love Asia Argento and her friends, love the tone and dialogue.  But overall it didn't satisfy due to an equal number of detractions.

Mixed bag.  I enjoyed it, but when viewed as a total package, I don't know if I could recommend this to many people outside of WG fans.  I enjoyed it, but it certainly has it's flaws, there are a lot worse movies you could watch though.",1296864000,6,3340,4.449013157894737
1247479,2,B00001YXCD,I fell asleep watching this movie. Nothing ever seems to happen. Not much of a plot. A waste of good actors.,1295049600,,108,4.190476190476191
1247480,1,B00001YXCD,"Im a huge Ferrera fan, i love his dark, no light at the end of the tunnell aproach to filmaking... howver this movie is just terrible! I mean really freaking bad. Like, the worst I have ever seen. Walken couldn't help it, and neither could Dafoe.

Whether its Neo-punk or not shouldnt even matter, this movie is HORRIBLE!",1269475200,,321,4.5344827586206895
1247481,3,B00001YXCD,"Obviously this movie was hampered by budget.  The director and actors are all top notch.  The story is good, but a little short.  If they had a bigger budget it could have been superb.  Too bad it wasn't picked by hollywood and was done foreign.  It's worth watching.",1266278400,,267,4.479166666666667
1247482,3,B00001YXCD,"As the Cyberpunk genre of Science Fiction writing grew in both authorship and readership, it only made sense that Hollywood would try it's hand at re-creating it in film. The results have been mostly dismal. Johnny Mnemonic and Paycheck might have had the plot elements but were way short of the ""feel"" so prevalent in the writing. Maybe they suffered from the star power or excessive budgeting or whatever but they were way short of the mark.

Enter Abel Ferrara. I'll say up front I like much of his work, with The King of New York being my favorite. The first time I saw it I was a bit confused as to all the things going on in the plot line, but the feeling of the film stayed with me to the point where I had to see it again. Now it's in my library and I watch it a couple of times a year. This is what makes this film mostly (but not entirely) successful. Of the several movies I've seen delving into Cyberpunk this is the one that comes closest to approaching the feeling of the Gibsian not too distant future, over technologized, over incorporated society. Things are moving at a breakneck pace and the stakes are high. The genius stroke in technology can put one company on top and another in the grave and that's pretty much what is happening here. Chris Walken and Willem Defoe are the primaries in a scheme to get a top engineer from one company to another and things go really bad.

The plot is great to a point but the problem is that it doesn't really end. It stops. The climax comes way too early and there's no reason to keep the movie going but it does for what seems like forever. I won't spoil things but Defoe ends up in a cubby hole at ""The New Rose Hotel"" replaying the events in his mind and the viewer must now re-watch many of the scenes he's already watched. Was the script that bad or did they simply run out of money. Maybe they thought they had a 90 minute movie and only had 75 minutes after the final cut. Whatever....this is why the film ultimately fails.

This should be seen though because it is one of the only films of its kind to capture the essence of the literature. A great effort if nothing else.",1256860800,2,2138,4.287128712871287
1247483,5,B00001YXCD,"I started watching the movie, finally having had it on hold, i'd heard about it and how hated it was apparently. As a film it's great, obviously not the greatest thing, but it was pretty intimate. It wasn't a big ending or it wasn't much an action thriller, it wasn't that kind of picture at all. But, it was definitely a picture about the characters. The look of the film was very interesting and very dark, the score was pretty great, the acting too, great. I think Ferrara made a great film, that seems to really be something that's been misunderstood. I haven't read the William Gibson short story so i don't know how much it differs from the original story, but adaptations are hardly ever perfect, maybe a few times, but what counts is the film on it's own. How the film performs and if it does anything for you.",1251763200,2,818,4.423841059602649
1247484,3,B00001YXCD,"New Rose Hotel, based on the short story by William Gibson , is a very confusing yet entertaining film from director Abel Ferrara. You might not be clear on what is actually happening, not at first anyway, but you will be certain of how Abel fell for his leading lady Asia Argento. The two dated for a while after the making of this film. Argento is not only incredibly sexy but she can also act. She's the best thing going for this film which stars Christopher Walken as Fox and Willem Defoe as X. The film takes place sometime in the future and major corporations are stealing top scientists from rival companies. Fox and X are trying to lure a Japanese scientist to their company. They hire a struggling prostitute and dancer named Sandi (Argento) to seduce him. She agrees to do it after they tell her how much they are going to pay her. X starts tutoring her in how to be seductive and the two fall for each other. Several steamy sex scenes follow and Fox gets wind of his partner's new fling. He worries that this will jeopardize their mission but also their friendship. Walken does a good job of showing the fear that Fox has as the older of the two who worries that his young protege is going to leave him. The basic plot is very similar to that of a classic film noir where two guys use a beautiful young woman to get information about a mystery man. One of the guys falls for the girl, the other guy gets suspicious, and someone dies. For the film's first hour it seems like scenes are being cut short and we aren't getting the full story. Abel plays the full scenes during the film's last half hour cluing us in on what he was hiding. This makes that portion of the film the most exciting since we're finally getting the full story and by this time we're invested in what  happens to X and Sandi. The acting from the three leads is excellent and there is a lot of humor in the film. Early on there is a scene between Walken and Defoe that starts off scripted and ends on a hilarious rant improvised by both men. It's a nice Abel touch. Many of the people who worked on this film worked on Abel's previous film ""The Funeral"" including Walken, Gretchen Mol, Annabella Sciorra, and Victor Argo. This film also has a great score by Ferrara regular Schooly D. Definitely worth checking out for Abel fans or for any of the three stars.",1201305600,,2340,4.354691075514874
1247485,3,B00001YXCD,"Sometimes making a feature length film from a short story can work, as the director can elaborate and add texture to the story. Most of the time, short stories make bad movies, and New Rose Hotel exemplifies why. About half-way through this interesting (but ultimately empty) film, the story noticeably looses steam and goes into ""filler"" mode, where we get a bunch of flash-backs on things we've already seen. But I've jumped ahead. Here's the story.

Christopher Walken and Willem DeFoe are free-lancers in a sort of dystopia of corporate rule, emotional distance, and meaningless sex. They basically ""turn"" high-level corporate employees, getting paid for facilitating the ""defection"" of these ""stars"" from one company to another - the right people can mean billions to a company's bottom line. Like many movies, we join our ""heroes"" at a critical point, where they are this/close to either the motherload score or a body bag.

Enter the off-beat, talented and unconventionally gorgeous Asia Argento as the hooker with the heart of gold (or maybe stone), who they task to ""turn"" a big-time scientist-type genius dud. Needless to say, things start off one way, then twists happen that spin the story in a different direction, all complicated by DeFoe falling for the sexy Argento.

Walken is excellent here, as he's allowed to really go with it, spouting lines only he can deliver, making those faces and even doing a little song and dance. DeFoe is...DeFoe - always solid, but given a character that is not completely realized, and a story that is a little transparent. But Argento is the show - sexy, tattooed and hard-to-take-your-eyes-off in a fairly explicit role (the Euros are so comfortable with their bodies...). Also ""stars"" Gretchen Mol in what is nothing more than a glorified cameo (I'm guessing some scenes wound up on the cutting room floor). See ""much more"" of her in the Bettie Page flick inwhich she stars.

Unfortunately, as mentioned, the story runs out of steam, gets very ""noire""-ishly conventional, and wraps itself up quickly and unfulfillingly, as if its double-parked. It seems as if its making a statement early on (greed, nations ruled by corporations, etc...), then loses its way.

Would have given this 2 stars if not for the luscious Argento, who brings a raw sexuality to her performance. She makes the first half of this as interesting as the second half (w/o much of her) is as uninspired.",1191801600,,2425,4.977777777777778
1247486,2,B00001YXCD,"An unbelievable mess, this incredibly confusing movie makes Ferrara previous ""The Blackout"" a model of narrative clarity. This shoddy movie is one of the reasons that Ferrara has become more and more a marginal figure (his films are now barely released in the US). The reason why actors of the caliber of Dafoe and Walken starred and produced this movie is beyond me. The only thing that makes this movie worth a look are a few nude scenes from the beautiful Asia Argento.",1180396800,,472,4.698795180722891
1247487,4,B00001YXCD,"This is a very good, intelligent B-movie in the science fiction realm- especially if you have ever enjoyed some of William Gibson's stories. Having Wil Dafoe and Asia Argento in this is a very nice bonus, but not the only things that make this film so good. It is this director's raw talent in directing, as seen in all his gritty thrillers, combined with a great SF author and good job by the screen writer. I do not write reviews about romances or comedies, and I wish some others who do not care for a genre would offer the same courtesy. This is an excellent film. I had no trouble following the story, but had read the short story 10 years prior- so was vaguely familiar. Have also read nearly all William Gibson's novels, so very familiar with the concepts which some might find hard to follow.",1165708800,3,800,4.448979591836735

Dafoe ends up flashing back, remembering, thinking, maybe, was it him that Walken and Argento were messing with or whatever...the flashback segment goes on and on and we are rendered bored watching this poor sap try to puzzle the pieces together and when it comes to the end you don't care about any of the characters. The part where I laughed the most was when Walken was through off to his death...I think he yelled ""Wow!"" really loud and all I saw was him fall and go splat...even when he gets killed, Walken is still the funny man. Also starring Annabella Sciorra (Jungle Fever, Underworld (1997) and Gretchen Mol (The Thirteenth Floor, Forever Mine), both are barely in this movie and are wasted.

1247489,2,B00001YXCD,"Look, it's like this.
  The story New Rose Hotel, by William Gibson is one which hilights the decay of society through peoples own self destructive impulses and that never ending bain of humanity greed.
As a story, New Rose Hotel is to be honest way to short to even contemplate making a movie out of it.  There's just not enough there and when I watch the movie, it shows immensely.  Dafoe and Walken are 2 of my favourite actors and there performance together I found to be of good status.  What this movie needed to do was give the viewer a good explanation as to the status of the society , this different world, basically an atmosphere.  Instead it gives you a blurred corporate scene and then your thrown into a bar with women that can't sing and the 2 main characters forcing themselves to make out there enjoying the poor entertainment.  The exchanging of information should have been more secretive and when people wispered in others ears you should have been given a zoom on that audio. Then there was the main guts of the story, with the nano technologist.  This was what could have been the movies saviour, alas it was brushed over and the conversations where the main focus of the movie.  This brings me to my last annoyance. The person in charge of camera directing should have been .... Instead of seeing people interacting together at important sections of the story, you got terrible close ups of single faces that were below amateur quality and destracted you from the dialogue.  All in all Gibson should have written extra material for the movie and a lot more should have been spent on atmosphere to enhance the intrigue of the story, even if it meant getting more cost effective actors. ...I like to end with a positive note, and the only one I can make as far as capturing the story goes, is that the end scene that Dafoe acted out at the end was effective enough.
If your like me and a fan of William Gibson and these two great actors, you may want this movie as part of your collection, but I tell you now, after your first viewing it's one that will sit and gather dust very quickly.",1050624000,4,2108,4.48041775456919
1247490,4,B00001YXCD,"Notice that almost no one gives this film its average score (around 2.3 stars)?  It's a classic bimodal distribution: hate it or love it.  Well, maybe ""love it"" is a bit strong, but for those who 1) don't know the plot ahead of time, and 2) carefully follow the plot as it develops in the film, particularly in the last quarter, the story is quite gripping.  If you've read the story ahead of time, or lose the plot while watching, it will just seem like a very low-budget muddle.
Like many of Gibson's stories, this is hardly science fiction-- in fact, it's more purely noir than many other more noir-y looking films that come to mind.  As such, it's about money, love, betrayal, women, memory, machismo--that sort of stuff.  Having read the story after seeing the film, I'd almost say the movie was better, while still being true to Gibson's spirit: less of the narrator's whiny voice, more Fox; more mystery, less pseudo-futuristic-cosmopolitanism.  And a much better finish.
The best part is really the much-maligned last quarter, which in its memory flashbacks leads you to discover for yourself who betrayed whom and why.  The conclusion, if you care about these sorts of issues at all, is really quite sad and moving.  Not knowing when it would end, I jumped up close to the TV to hear Argento's reply to Dafoe's last line.  To end there shows that these guys knew what they were doing.",1049414400,14,1393,4.676229508196721

The ""eroticism"" is cheesy, the story meanders... it's as if noone was really interested in making this.  If so, it shows.
If this had been a low budget b-movie, it might have had ""so-bad-it's-good"" potential.  Nope.

The sex scenes, which are numerous and ordinarily include several women at once, were actually well done though peculiarly uninteresting.  Walkin and Defoe are on their game, and nearly make it a worthwhile viewing, but the script writer and the director were both asleep at the wheel.  As a science fiction film, it contains nothing interesting either. The story is boring, and plods through irrelevant scenes. I had high hopes for this film; thinking it was similar to 'Blade Runner' and possibly half as good. After watching the first few minutes, I was minded of 'Liquid Sky'.  However, it wasn't even half as good as 'Liquid Sky', and that is not a great film either, but at least it held the viewers interest.

Great story, right?  Well, if you watched the movie, you wouldn't have been able to made sense of the plot above.  It was only after reading Mr. Gibson's story that I understood the plot.

The movie was pleasant to watch for the most part.  No technical glitches or cheap effects.  However, what good is a movie if you can't understand what's going on?

1247494,5,B00001YXCD,"Abel Ferrara is one of those directors that people either love, or don't know exists, and New Rose Hotel is one of his films to treasure. This adaption of William Gibson's short story ""New Rose Hotel""is one of Ferrara's finer films.
Fortunately Ferrara is committed to film. he will ignore whatever and keep making films regardless.
Ferrara is obviously not a person imprisoned by the notion of 'good taste', but more to the point, recognises that life is an emotional mental and physical experience - sex looks weird, decisions are 'non logical' and the world is bigger than any individual. These are virtues.
Forget everything you have heard about William Gibson - 'cyberpunk' blah blah blah. Ferrera pulls out the beating heart and mind (they are the same thing) at the centre of the short story and avoids speculation about 'the future. This is a love story, and it reeks of semen, strange urges and a distinctively human scent. This is not a sci-fi story, and If anyone tells you this is a sci-fi story, never take a word they say seriously again.
The smartest move Ferrara makes is recognising that the future looks remarkably like the present. Freedom! left the geeks behind, so lets get on with it!
Once again Walken pulls out the stops for Ferrara and delivers the kind of desparte, funny, tender, sad, tragic, half mad characterisations only these two seem to know how to cook up. It is also a thrill to see Willem de Foe deliver a good performance in a watchable film.
Like a lot of Ferrara's films its riches are yielded through multiple viewings - engaging, confusing, evocative - the relationship between the three protaganists and their place in a world they don't quite understand, and which will surprise them.
It would be tempting to call this an arthouse movie - but that is an insult. When arthouse stands for some halfwitted pose (it is not good enough to mock mainstream film values - you actually need to deliver something superior), Ferrara is a rare talent. he doesn't need our encouragement, but do see this movie before he explodes.",1029110400,4,2059,4.7703081232493
1247495,2,B00001YXCD,"""New Rose Hotel"" is the second attempt to turn a William Gibson story into a feature-length film (after the fairly disastrous ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" starring King of Inexpression Keanu Reeves), and its pedigree is what drew me toward it: stars Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, Asia Argento(!), and director Abel Ferrara (""Ms. 45"") all have steady reputations in the film world.  This gave me a slight reassurance: ""no matter how bad the script is, the cast and direction could make up for it.""
Well, ""New Rose Hotel"" is the type of film that exists in the twilight zone between films that are so bad they're painful to watch, and films that are so bad they're a laugh riot.  The story has something to do with two cyber-pirates (Walken & Dafoe) who hire Asia Argento to fall in love with a prestigious Japanese scientist, and collect a large sum of money in the process. The events unfold with a maximum of confusion and even when things actually seem to be making sense, they just get confusing again.
That's not to say ""New Rose Hotel"" is ALL bad.  Sterling Video, which released this specimen, is a company pretty notorious for pushing out low-budget, bill-paying dreck featuring brand-name stars under the radar of the mainstream so as to pass unnoticed to the library shelves at your local video store.  And this is no exception.  While Walken and Dafoe bring trademark professionalism to their nothing roles, you know this wasn't a movie made for Academy Award consideration.  Ferrara, however, seems to have given up hope after filming, allowing the editor to piece together what little story there was using the gimmick of close-circuit cameras for stylistic value.  And Asia Argento, it must be said, is an AMAZINGLY bad actress who would have no career if she wasn't the daughter of Italain director Dario Argento; she mumbles her lines to the point where you won't be able to make out what she's saying (not a bad thing, considering this film makes good use of her physical assets).
""New Rose Hotel"" is a low-budget, confusing mess that would be completely forgettable without the presence of Walken and Dafoe.  Some scenes retain a sense of style, but other than that this is a lost cause.  If you're compelled to rent this, go in with your expectations low and it'll pass easier.",995760000,4,2289,4.8188775510204085
1247496,3,B00001YXCD,"For William Gibson fans, this movie was not so bad. It was (relatively) faithful to the short story.  It was, for the budget and what it was, not too bad an adaption to film.  Certainly better than Johnny Mnemonic, from that standpoint.  I believe the director also directed Bad Lieutenant (another character study) which, when I realized it, made the format of how the film is more sensical.  He went along a similar vein here in terms of studying the people rather than following the events around them.
The characters were well-cast in my opinion, based on the short story of the same name.  As other reviewers pointed out, it DOES add a lot to the genre.  All the cyberpunk stories are _not_ just the Matrix or Blade Runner, or a mishmash of either.  (Not that they're bad.  In fact, I enjoy both.)  This succeeds in presenting a dramatic tale in the shady future Gibson created.
There are problems among the good stuff, make no mistake.  [VERY MINOR SPOILER BELOW}
The montage at the end was, well....utterly boring and pointless.  It gives the impression (whether or not it was actually true) that one ran out of time before the film was supposed to be over, so a slide show of various images from the hours previous that you've already seen are presented in a confusing cloud of images...which serve no real purpose.  Up until that point however, the movie as both a character study and a suspensful tale are not bad at all.  It's sort of like A.I.  You KNOW when the movie ends, yet a little snippet drags it on well past it should.
Anyway, give it a try, especially if you are a Gibson fan, and if Johnny Mnemonic thoroughly disappointed you.  This will give you more faith in future renditions, at least a little (and pray like hell for Sci-Fi to pick up one of his books for a mini series, heh)  Another thing to keep in mind with books, especially Gibson, is that the true caliber of his work in many ways can't be put on film.  I don't know if there is a way to portray the terror, disappointment and cruelness of the future of his world in a movie....but I'd have to say that this movie made at least a valliant attempt, and a better one than JM.",995587200,2,2160,4.441624365482234
1247497,4,B00001YXCD,"Apparently most viewers hate this movie.  It is not an easy movie to follow, I grant you.  However, I've seen most of Abel Ferrara's films and liked them plus I generally go for anything with Willem Dafoe in it.  Walken is a favorite too.  Hubby absolutely adored it and would probably go the whole 5 stars if he were writing this, which puts him at variance with almost everyone.  I can't go that far but I will go 4 stars.  The plot is not that tricky.  What is tricky is knowing what moment of time you are in with the characters.  At any given moment you can be at the start, middle or end of the story. In this it rather resembles ""Memento,"" which is in the theaters now.  Ferrara should have considered changes in lighting or some other visual key to cue the viewers into this time shifts.  I've seen this done by shooting part of a film in black and white and the rest in color.  I've also seen one time sequence shot in all cool or blue tones while the rest of the movie is shot in reddish hot tones.  In short, there are ways to make this easier on the viewer.

The plot is that Walken and Dafoe are going to make an Asian scientist fall in love with a call girl they've just met, Sandy.  Sandy will bewitch the scientist and he will go wherever she wants him to go. Industrialists will pay Walken and Dafoe big money for the con.  They in turn will pay Sandy a million dollars as her share.  The question becomes though who is conning whom. While Dafoe is busy falling in love with Sandy, he doesn't follow through on tracing the various leads about her which come into his hands. One irony I couldn't get over was Dafoe being stunned by someone else's beauty, when, in his prime, he had to have been one of the most beautiful people on the planet. Move this back to the 1980s and probably no one would be looking at the call girls in this film! My absolute favorite movie by Ferrara is ""Bad Lieutenant"" with Harvey Keitel in the starring role.  Keitel gives the performance of his life in that film and it is much easier to follow than this one. Before you totally write off this film maker, you might give that one a a try if all the negative reviews on this one are too much for you.

The rest of the movie  is dreary and slow. I really hate to condemn honest attempts at artistic  expression, and I believe that this is an honest attempt. Ferrera makes  demands on his audience--which is fine; there's no excuse for laziness--but  when those demands are met, they ought to be rewarded.  This movie does not  reward what can only be called the stoic endurance of anyone who manages to  sit through it.
Other reviews have outlined the plot, so I don't need to  repeat it here.  I will say, though, that Walken and Defoe are horribly  misused in this movie.  Art doesn't need to be boring.  Tolstoy doesn't  bore us.  Hemingway doesn't bore us.  Orson Welles doesn't bore us.  Hitchcock doesn't bore us.  Why does Ferrera sacrifice content at the altar  of style?  This movie isn't only tedious, it is *needlessly* tedious.  The  movie takes a good idea, a good story, and ruins it.  You'll pull your hair  out watching Willem Defoe agonize alone in a tiny hotel room for 20  minutes.  Guess what he's agonizing over: Love.  Yawn.  His agony is  nothing compared to ours, watching this movie.
Abel Ferrera is best when  he's delivering straight entertainment (King of New York, and Body  Snatchers, for instance), and using his stylistic flourishes to satisfying  the narrative, not his own pretenses.",964483200,5,1502,4.856573705179283
1247501,1,B00001YXCD,"But preternaturally awful in film.
Since Gibson's accomplishments as a writer of science fiction include the  coining of the term ""cyberspace"" and several field-advancing novels that  shaped the  entire course of the cyberpunk sub-genre, it seems an amazing  thing that a  half-decent film based on one of his books either:
A) Cannot be made.  B) Cannot be made even with him writing the screenplay.  C) Cannot be made  with a trillion dollars and an executive order compelling  every last  American citizen to watch and enjoy it.
Some of us have had the  misfortune of watching _Johnny Mnemonic_, an  extrapolation by Gibson on  one of his short stories from the _Burning  Chrome_ collection.  Even in a  career as uneven as Keanu Reeves has had,  it's one of the weaker efforts  in a portfolio that includes _Point Break_.
_Point Break_.  For the love  of God.
This latest effort, also taken from the aforementioned  collection of short  stories, is called _New Rose Hotel_, which stars  Christopher Walken, Willem  Dafoe and Asia Argento, an actress of whom I  had not previously heard.  The  plot, insofar as it goes, is that a  maverick researcher from one genetic  engineering concern in Germany is  wanted by another in Japan.  Walken and  Dafoe engage in a sort of  intellectual larceny by convincing the unhappy and  talented to disappear  from their current employers and relocate to one who  pays Walken and  Dafoe.  Asia Argento, whose name and soft Italo-Hispanic  contralto suggest  a career that will unfold between the hours of 2 and 6  a.m. on Cinemax,  plays a postmodern lounge singer whose act includes two  other women  kissing and caressing her through each song.  Walken has the  brilliant  idea to recruit Argento to seduce his quarry for corporate  relocation, and  it falls to Dafoe to train her properly through no fewer  than three nude  sequences.
I love the work of William Gibson and want to see it onscreen  in as many well-conceived adaptations as Hollywood's small collective mind  will permit.  This film is not under that category, and in fact is so far  away from  being in it that particles of light currently at that category  may not reach  this film for several decades.  I guess that I can forgive  Dafoe and Walken  - we all have balloon mortgage payments or bone-marrow  transplants or  something that might justify appearing in this for some  undisclosed fortune  - and Asia Argento will probably never have a chance  to work in more  dignified settings.
Apparently the director's idea of  conveying a dark, near-future setting is  to film his researcher in grainy  segments that look like an extremely weak  television signal for a show  that no one wants to view.  The omnipresence  and power of the corporation,  Japanese culture and all of Gibson's other  touches that define the  contiguous world of his books are not here.  Anywhere.  The coffin hotel of  the New Rose outside of Narita International  is as close as it gets, and  by the time you see that you have tired  completely of the film's last  third, which is Dafoe and Walken having  flashbacks of the film's  uninteresting first two-thirds.
Even though I felt suspicious of a DVD  title priced less than one night at  the base theater with Junior Mints, I  felt that a smaller-scale film  released without any pretense of competing  at the box office might be worth  it.  Possibly.  But don't buy, rent or  allow yourself to waste precious  hours of consciousness on this.",962841600,9,3484,4.873483535528596

1247505,1,B00001YXCD,"Gibson, whose first adaptation was slaughtered in Johnny Mnemonic, has been shafted royally again with this awful, bad, stinky mess of a film.  I'm truly sorry I sat through it.  The lighting is awful, the sound nearly  nonexistent, the production values forgotten (gee, Mr. Dafoe, what was it  like to crawl around in a box in a warehouse with a toy gun?)--and the  stars, perfect for the parts, are wasted.  Even the relatively unknown Asia  Argento, obviously a serious talent, is limited to singing (very, very  quietly) and being topless a lot.
In an immediate conflict with the  original short, the movie starts out by telling its story in normal  narrative fashion and THEN going to the flashback.  This last, employed  well by Gibson, turns into a retread of literally the entire film (albeit  with a bit of different sequencing and a good deal more porn).
You'll end  up watching out of sheer morbid curiosity, hoping desperately that the  already mutilating screenwriter will at least supply a different ending.  You'll be disappointed.

Interesting to follow her career up to this point, a mix of strange arthouse films (New Rose Hotel, B. Monkey)  and European productions (Phantom of the Opera, La Reine Margot).
But New  Rose Hotel was an eyesore.
Abel Ferrara's continued pretenses towards  some kind of metaphysical statement are beginning to annoy greatly.  New  Rose Hotel is just as heavy-handed, drug-clouded, boring, and pretentiously  acted as any '90s Ferrara film (aside from the more accessible commercial  fare The Body Snatchers and the acclaimed Bad Lieutenant).  Ferrara manages  to take two great actors, Willem Dafoe and Asia Argento, and direct them in  such a way as to eliminate both of them of any charm whatsoever.  His idea  of internal complexity seems to be letting Dafoe sit in the dark with a  pensive expression on his face.  And Christopher Walken?  He's been  sleepwalking all the way through the '90s, saddled with role after role  where he tries to be cool and impenetrable, succeeding only in being a  nuisance.

Like a helpless  observer of some horrible accident, I felt a morbid fascination to continue  viewing, so as to see just how bad this thing ultimately could become.  The  lighting and sound seem to have been handled by members of the wrong union,  for the scenes were often far too dark and the tv's volume had to be  increased to the point of distortion to compensate for the terrible sound.  This was not a matter of actors mumbling, although they did indeed do that.  No, this was a matter of someone apparently using a ""Mr. Mike""  to record the film.  The plot itself was terribly shallow and quite absurd.

I like the cool multilingual title sequence, the very-easy-on-the-eyes Asia Argento, and Dafoe and Walken's performances. I can understand some viewers struggling with the film's editing and pacing, but I'd keep an open mind if you haven't seen it before. It may not be as powerful as Bad Lieutenant, but I think Ferrara tried hard to capture the spirit of the short story. It doesn't exactly do world-building like a lot of sci fi does (or tries to), but it definitely creates a world of its own with a kind of cool, cosmopolitan aesthetic.
