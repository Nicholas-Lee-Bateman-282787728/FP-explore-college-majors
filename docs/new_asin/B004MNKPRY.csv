8436128,5,B004MNKPRY,A must have for beginners!,1478390400,,26,4.4
8436129,5,B004MNKPRY,The author is a great teacher. I love his techniques and it is very easy to understand his instructions.,1462752000,,104,4.526315789473684
8436130,5,B004MNKPRY,"In this video David discusses the basics to get you started then proceeds to detailed demonstration/instruction.  His presentation is very crisp and focused.  Maybe if you're a professional who has nothing more to learn this would be boring. However, I think Davids techniques are not typical and most painters can learn from it....even if you adapt some of what he does into your own style.  Now it's all about practice.",1397433600,,421,4.985714285714286
8436131,4,B004MNKPRY,I thought it was very informative.  I am an oil painter.  I was curious about acrylic painting.  T'was very interesting.,1392336000,,120,4.9
8436132,5,B004MNKPRY,"One of the reviewers says this video separates the men from the boys. He's absolutely right. David starts with the very basics, talking about materials, brushes, etc (no fancy signature brushes) and I was surprised he only has 5 colors in his pallet, typically. He says it's easier to travel with and it makes you learn color mixing better.

For the absolute beginner, this will be too much to take in at once. I've been painting only a couple of months, but I've read several books and watched many videos, and a lot of this was still eye-opening to me. He talks about how to set up your painting from the very beginning, with the idea it will be sold at some point, so some of the points he discusses wouldn't be immediately relevant to someone just starting out. For example, talking about preparing your board or canvas so that the underlying color of the material doesn't affect the painting, and using four or five layers of gesso. Overkill for a practicing beginner, but great to know long-term. Also, you will never look at white paint(s) the same after watching this video. Wow.

And I need to mention his presentation. It is tight, focused, and articulate. No tangents or babbling. He goes from one subject to another seamlessly, without missing a beat.

Anyway, buy this video and buy it now. You won't regret it unless you are a seasoned professional painter.",1388448000,4,1371,4.680497925311204
8436133,5,B004MNKPRY,This man is as good as it gets when it comes to painting and is great explaining his techniques .Videos are cheaper than 100's of dollars worth of art lessons !Great deal worth the money!,1386979200,,187,4.371428571428571
8436134,5,B004MNKPRY,"This video separates the men from the boys, so to speak.
David Kitler knows his subject intimately and shares his knowledge clearly and articulately. I've had to watch it a few times so far to let it all sink in. Thank you David!",1371600000,,229,4.348837209302325
8436135,5,B004MNKPRY,"Full of good techniques, though a lot of the dvd is for beginning artists or artist just beginning to paint with acrylics. Over all very good, taught by a good teacher.",1371081600,,168,4.451612903225806
8436136,5,B004MNKPRY,"Loved this DVD.  I felt that it was alittle expencive but purchased it anyway.  I am glad that I did.  I learned a lot from this DVD and am in the process of painting a picture using his technique now.  I am loving the results.  If you like realism in painting you will like this DVD.  I also have his second DVD and like it also, But this is the one I liked the most.  I was looking for a different technique and I found his to be just what I was looking for.  I have seen several different DVDs with acrylics but after watching them just felt like I watched a demo, Mr. Kitler is a teacher,  I felt I learned something from him.  If you are looking for a gift for a inspiring artist this would be a good begining.",1365724800,2,715,3.971830985915493
