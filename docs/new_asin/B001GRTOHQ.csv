3619071,4,B001GRTOHQ,"Some how I always stumble across Zombie movies as a Zombie is drawn to fresh meat.  I caught Zombie Wars (DVD release Feb 2008) listed in my On Demand Movies in Atlantic Broadband.  I was sure that I was going to see another independent, beyond the valley of the low budget movies with actors who all at one time took part in their elementary school plays and little else.  Boy was I gratefully wrong!

Zombie Wars is a grade B indie with new twists turns and excellent makeup with solid use of CG and good acting.  It does take an open mind for this movie and those who consider themselves Romero and Fulci purists need not apply.  These Zombies are the next evolution of Zombies or Zombies with the power of reason who some how learn how to harvest people.  The story line can best be compared to the original Beneath the Planet of the Apes although these Zombies still can not speak; just grunt and bark.  It seem in the movie that the Zombies now outnumber us and what is left of ""us"" are little more than commando units or so it seems.  Without spoiling anything I will add that as typical there is a group of ""Us"" who aren't exactly with the program.

My only issue with Zombie Wars is why a DVD that was released in February of 2008 is already gone?  There is barely a mention of it in any of the movie review web sites.  One day some one will wake up and give this movie a little marketing push and I am sure that there will be a market for it.  All in all Zombie Wars was a highly enjoyable campy splatter fest with enough gore, dismembered people, head shot zombies and decapitation to hold the typical viewers interest.  If you can it is well worth the watch!  I give it 4 stars when compared to the indie crowd.  3 stars if you are again a little narrow minded and only accept Romero et al.",1232236800,4,1802,4.2404692082111435

3619074,4,B001GRTOHQ,"It's obviously low-budget, but I liked the actors, characters and plot. I was expecting worse dialogue and narration, but was pleasantly surprised. The very beginning and end are my only major critiques of an otherwise enjoyable film. The start didn't hold my attention and almost made me stop watching. The conclusion was wasted on shock value and should have turned out differently. A minor critique is not further exploring the zombies' culture or, with such levels of intelligence, why they wouldn't kill their food before eating rather than let it suffer, if you understand my meaning - especially since we see limbs hung out to be (presumably) devoured later. Otherwise, I found myself actually caring about what happened to the characters. It reminded me of Planet of the Apes.",1507680000,,784,5.0852713178294575
3619075,3,B001GRTOHQ,"If you are looking for a Hollywood blockbuster this is not for you. If ,however, you are willing to give a lower budget independent film a chance you may enjoy this movie as much as I did.
Granted the zombie makeup was not good but the story line was and the actors were a step above most low budget horror.
Actually glad I gave it a chance.",1507161600,,341,4.104477611940299
3619076,4,B001GRTOHQ,"Probably more like a 3 star, but I think some of the ultra low ratings for this one are unfair, so I'm awarding an extra point...

Yes, it's low budget...  clearly...  that said, the camera work was decent, sound quality was well above par for low budget, special effects were nothing great, but again they were decent...  and the story line was pretty unique.  not totally out of the box ( like say ""Scent"" ), but interesting and different enough to keep me entertained...

This would probably have been a legit 4 star movie if they took a little more time with their effects, and brought in something like a stunt / fight  coordinator to help with some of the fight scenes...  ( the fight scenes / hand to hand struggles with the zombies were pretty silly looking )

I won't argue that there aren't some ""dumb"" aspects to this film...  but if you enjoy zombie flicks, and have nothing to do for a rainy day afternoon...  It's OK...",1506988800,,933,4.461538461538462

3619078,2,B001GRTOHQ,"ZOMBIE WARS is not the worst bottom feeder of a zombie film but it is close.  The acting, scripting, FX, and pacing are what one might expect from a high schooler with a hand cam and no budget.  Sometimes even woefully incompetent films may have a certain charm.  Think of ROBOT MONSTER or PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  No such luck here.  Humanity has been afflicted with a zombie virus for fifty years and the only surviving living humans have organized themselves into ragtag paramilitary bands.  Facing them are zombies in the billions.  A minor note of interest is that these zombies can think--sort of--and can co-operate in the breeding of humans for consumption.  This co-operation among zombies brings in a context that most zombie directors avoid.  How do zombies reason?  Or communicate? Or show any cerebral activity beyond their mad dash to eat human beings?  ZOMBIE WARS suggests that when the very last edible humans are consumed, the zombie billions will have to evolve to propagate their species.  Can they breed? A most disquieting thought.  Somewhere in the dreck that is ZOMBIE WARS is the suggestion that on some primitive level zombies and humans are essentially alike.",1316822400,,1187,4.934343434343434

Ever imagined a world where the zombies have gained some intelligence beyond aimlessly seeking some brains?  Possibly where the last remnants of mankind is subdivided into small bands of mercenaries, or even possibly the zombies have started capturing humans for purposes of propagation of the human species so that they have a continued food source?  Well if you have then you have the premise of this movie.  This movie sort of cuts the line between normal zombie flick and adds its own flare and take on zombies, and while the movie itself is a B grade movie, it does have the gore of a full fledged Romero flick.  So if your someone that likes zombie movies just because they are ZOMBIE movies, then this might even get you a rating of 4, a purist of Romero might give it a 2.  I however rate it a 3.  I love zombie movies, but i thought that this one could have had more OOmmph to it it.  Still a good movie all in all.",1292371200,,952,4.4
3619080,2,B001GRTOHQ,"Can't imagine why anyone would give this gobbler more than two stars, unless they've never really seen an actual 3, 4,or 5 star movie. Anyway. Production values are okay, sound is good and it's in focus, worth an extra star because most of this low budget stuff is even worse.",1276732800,,276,4.54
3619081,3,B001GRTOHQ,"I am a sucker for Zombie films even though most of them tend to wallow near the bottom of the cinema cesspool, (a ripple above the slasher genre). To my surprise this proved to be a reasonably well made Zombie film-all things considered. Sure the acting is a little suspect and the score often reveals it's B-movie origins, BUT this is still a fair to good Zombie film. I won't write a plot synopsis as that has already been provided, however, be prepared to witness a novel entry in Zombie cinema. ZOMBIE WARS, (or WAR OF THE LIVING DEAD, its alternative title), portrays a future where humans are held captive by Zombies, and harvested for food. The film uses both Snyder runners as well as shambling Romero type Zombies which are dispatched by rebel human fighters with a gunshot to the head. ""Purists"" may not take to this change in Zombie ""culture"", though I personally found it a welcome addition in a sea of mediocrity. Yep, you got it, Zombies that can think and plot, at least in a rudimentary manner. Fortunately they don't talk but appear to communicate on some primitive level by way of grunts and growls. The camera work, sound and lighting was professionally executed and belies it's B movie origins. The picture transfer in WAR OF THE LIVING DEAD, which is the version I saw, is quite good and sharp, and it is presented in wide screen. In fact, I often forgot that I was watching a low budget film and found myself wanting more of ZOMBIE WARS! I even found myself appreciating some of the characterizations which made it easy to overlook the acting when it was spotty. I was also extremely pleased to see that the FX crew churned out Stage 3 Zombies! You heard it, Stage 3 Zombies... I am tired of seeing white faced make up and raccoon eyed Zombies (with that obligatory drool of blood seeping from the mouth). Cripes, I could whip that up in my kitchen. This is no longer the age of NOTLD, surely we have progressed beyond that vintage Zombie look? To all current and future Zombie film makers, think Stage 3 Zombie and repeat 3 times daily. Do not save money by cutting your special FX. Go big or go home. ZW's undead feature some of the best Stage 3 Zombies seen since Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD, (whose undead epitomize the classic Zombie appearance). This only makes sense as some of these corpses have been shuffling around for 50 years, (or so the film indicates). Gore-hounds take note, that there are plenty of head shots and some serious ripping that takes place here. There was an evisceration within the first 15 minutes and the credits rolled with distorted shots of Stage 3s doing their thing. ZOMBIE WARS is a gore-fest not to be missed and should please most Zombie fans who are not adverse to something different from the usual fare. Finally, the film makers largely strayed from the disastrous and annoying Horror comedy field, by keeping it dark (though fun filled). A solid three stars or more. A welcome entry and recommended, (if you can locate a copy)!",1235692800,2,2990,4.601123595505618
8306817,1,B001GRTOHQ,"Spoiler alert. Not one zombie in this movie looked like the one on the cover. The zombie makeup was not ""excellent"", maybe decent for Halloween dress up, but they all had clean hair and clothing was cut up ""pirate style"" and also, way too clean. Everyone's acting is terrible, even the zombies. Music and sound effects felt right out of the early 90's. ""Shwooshing"" sounds with screen swipes for scene changes?! I appreciate the attempt at an original story line, but it never truly makes sense. Action scenes are mildly comical (I'm sure it's not intentional) and while I usually enjoy beheadings, these are unrealistic: one swipe from a K-bar... yeah right. And the ending is trite and unresolved. I should have never resumed after the first time I bailed on it 10 minutes in. Curiosity can be debilitating. I hate myself for watching this garbage to completion. So annoyed I felt the need to warn others, do not believe the overall 3 star rating. I usually enjoy low-budget movies, but I need talent and logic included.",1520208000,,1022,4.779661016949152

IFor A David Prior movie, this is decidely NOT his most entertaining work.  This film is amateur hour from start to finish. Grade school special effects, combines with hideously stunted dialog, terrible acting & shoddy camera work. So far it's typical Prior, but it's missing the factor that made some of his other films so damn watchable.",1516579200,,701,4.737704918032787
