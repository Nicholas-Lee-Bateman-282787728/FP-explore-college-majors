6475829,4,B00L8QOY0C,"I bought the coffin Blu-ray set of the original monsters that Universal released a while back and I loved it! I wanted to get some of the sequels to my favorite monsters like this one, Creature From the Black Lagoon and Wolf Man. The set is nicely packaged and the quality of the films themselves are pretty standard for regular DVD. I recommend getting these individual sets if you don't care about the sequels for all of the monsters.",1410739200,10,436,4.531645569620253
6475830,4,B00L8QOY0C,"Disc 1:
The Invisible Man (1933)
Also included: An original documentary by, & feature commentary with, film historian Rudy Behlmer

Disc 2:
* The Invisible Man Returns (1940, 82 min.)
* The Invisible Woman (1940, 73 min.)
* Invisible Agent (1942, 82 min.)

Disc 3:
* The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944, 78 min.)
* Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951, 82 min.)

Frankenstein, directed by James Whale, was a big hit in 1931 & then in 1933 the same director brings us The Invisible Man; like the former, sharing the situation of a passionate young scientist who has disappeared in order to experiment alone. Of the other included films, the best are the amusing romp of `Abbott & Costello meet the Invisible Man' and `The Invisible Man Returns' isn't half bad either; but rather slow going at first: man on death row for murder he didn't commit gets disappearing drug slipped to him in jail so as to escape. On the outside he seeks to finds the real culprit in order to try to save his neck. Unfortunately for Vincent Price fans, however, that actor's distinctly captivating voice is hardly apparent in this film, as the Invisible Man. Apparently, the voice by which we have come to identify Mr. Price wasn't that developed when he made this film in his relative youth.

But let's end on a positive note. You can't go wrong with having a look at least at the original Invisible Man film (and do consider the original book by H.G. Wells; and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, while you're at it as well). Cheers!",1407628800,33,1515,4.662921348314606

6475850,5,B00L8QOY0C,"The Invisible Man  Complete Legacy Collection

This product has three DVDs with five invisible men movies from 1933 and the early 1940s, and an Abbott & Costello parody. The first DVD has The Invisible Man from 1933 which is based on a novel by H. G. Wells. The second DVD has the next three movies; the third DVD has the last two movies. These movies are digitally enhanced for clarity and contrast and are much better than what you saw on videotapes. The background to these stories tells about life as seen by Hollywood. Kurt Siodmark was the prolific screenwriter for many of the Universal Horror movies, a form of science fiction or a morality play, where a monster threatens people until the threat is ended.

Economic hard times lead to horror movies, like the science fiction of the early 1950s or todays stories about vampires and zombies. The 1974-75 Recession was followed by Jaws, a monster movie done in pseudo-documentary style. The current Great Recession should see other horror movies, or the re-release of the movies that frightened your grandparents in the 1930s. There are books that tell about Hollywood movies of the 1930s and 1940s. Movie theaters began a slow decline in the 1950s after the rise of television and then recorded videos. Was the idea of an invisible man taken from the writings of Adam Smith who told of an invisible hand that regulated the economy? An invisible hand requires an invisible man. Only a government or group of people can regulate the economy, and has tried to do so since recorded time.

The Invisible Man (1933) tells how a research scientist found a way to make a corporeal body invisible in daylight. This gave power to the man who ingested a drug, but had bad side effects that neutralized this power. It is a morality play that shows how power corrupts.

The Invisible Man Returns (1940) is about a man awaiting execution for murder. What if he disappears? Radcliffe searches for the real murderer and discovers the truth. A dying declaration should solve this case. Radcliffe gets a blood transfusion and regains his visibility!

The Invisible Woman (1940) involves a professor who wants a human test subject. We see Kittys life and conditions. Three bad guys try to steal this invention and fail due to Kittys actions. Kitty and Richard marry; will an invisible baby need visible diapers?

Invisible Agent (1942) tells how Frank Griffins grandson enlisted as a Government agent, went to Berlin, and after much trouble captured a book that listed the names of enemy spies operating in America then returned to England with a friend. This is not the best movie in this collection, it is an adventure movie with comic situations.

The Invisible Mans Revenge (1944) tells how Robert Griffin returned to England by ship to learn he was cheated out of his share of money from a partnership. He plots to get even, and finds a Doctor who will inject a serum to turn him invisible. Griffin has to find a way to make himself visible again, and uses illegal means. The dog of the Doctor follows Griffin and insures poetic justice. This movie is worth watching once for fans of this series.

Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951) is a parody of the invisible character (based in a boxing situation). The boys are recent graduates from a Detective School. Somehow it all comes all right, as the expanding prosperity in 1950s America.",1485302400,,3393,4.796232876712328

The Lagoon thing was a bore in the theatres. I liked and have the SHRINKING MAN too. I have a vast collection of over 1,700 DVDs. American titles from Korea, Germany, Spain and even China, that aren't on DVDs here. Korean writing on the back of the DVD cover but they are in English and picture perfect. I have BUSTER AND BILLIE and THE BOY ON A DOLPHIN but they need a DVD from the Studios. And Matt Dillon's' first feature film. From Germany but a Paramount release. I have that cover without the DVD. And Christopher Jones' four films should be put out too. THE REBEL (Nick Adams) has been released too. It said Walmart had a exclusive on them, but they aren't even selling them. I have the set.
