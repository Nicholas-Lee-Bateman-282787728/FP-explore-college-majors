5447043,4,B00AKIPBBK,"This film is very good drama, I liked it.  Not a lot of action but good enough.....  If you like good drama then you should watch this film.",1362528000,,140,3.9642857142857144
5447044,2,B00AKIPBBK,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but this film is not honest up front about what it is, which is a slow drama with very low production values.  I can forgive the poor acting, but with very little action and humor, it's a drama and should have been advertised as such.",1362528000,,267,4.235294117647059
5447045,4,B00AKIPBBK,"It is not a pure action flick. Yes there is some but that is not what the film is about. It is a very good drama.

Without giving much away, I enjoyed the film greatly. There are many subtle nuisances to Chinese culture. For a western audience the ending may be somewhat of a surprise. For a Chinese audience, the ending is already known. This would be like a version of Shakespeare play, adapted to a modern film. Or a version of something very familiar. Though it is nothing like this story wise, pretend a Shakespearean type movie came out, set in modern times. If you are familiar with the Shakespeare play you will have a good sense of how the movie goes.

So for a western audience it is a great drama. For a Chinese audience it is a very well done rendition of a known story.",1362268800,,782,4.277027027027027
5447046,3,B00AKIPBBK,"The Shaolin history lesson is interesting, and the story is cute... but the implementation is lacking.

There are a few transitions that didn't make sense, and while the main actor was fine, there were a lot of poorly acted support roles.",1362268800,,238,4.804878048780488
5447047,4,B00AKIPBBK,"This was a good story, wonderfully acted, photographed and scored. I cried genuine tears.  But it was poorly told. A better screenplay would have gained it 5 stars. It was disjointed, skipped over key parts and included unnecessary ones. It is definitely worth a watch (genuine tears, remember?) But with a bit of polish the gem would have shone so much brighter.",1362096000,,363,4.854838709677419
5447048,5,B00AKIPBBK,Not your typical martial arts flick.  It has action that satisfies but is thoughtful.  I found the characters fascinating.  This is a great flick!,1362009600,,146,5.0
8553103,5,B00AKIPBBK,"Peng Zhang Li movies are great,

The Kung Fu in it is most likely the best on film (.). Not only is he is a real monk, but these movies are wholesome, the movie ""Man from Shaolin"" has no cursing and is an awesome movie for family viewing with young children. The movie ""Last Kung Fu Monk"" has the best fighting scenes Ive ever viewed. Having studied Kung Fu for 20 years and been a personal student under him I can say this martial artist is second to none above the best in the world. Thus these are a must see!

Peng Zhang Li father started his studies before he entered the Shaolin Temple around 5 years old he was already one of the top students at entry. He has been an inspiration to me and has pushed my self-defense to a level I would never have achieved without his training.",1412467200,,784,4.185430463576159

8553106,2,B00AKIPBBK,"I found the movie to be slow moving, and the history of shaolin has been done a hundred times. character was a little engageing there needed to be a lot more action. wait for movie to be shown on Saturday t. v. , and save your money.",1400198400,,233,3.978723404255319
8553107,2,B00AKIPBBK,Would have liked alittle more action but the story was intresting. A little more work on the story line this could have been very good.,1367107200,,135,4.44
8553108,5,B00AKIPBBK,It is a great movie and every one family should watch it.  You will enjoy it and so will the family,1366761600,,99,3.7142857142857144
8553109,2,B00AKIPBBK,It was ok but could of been way better and the fighting scenes aren't that great. i wouldn't recommend it for anyone wanting a martial art movie. it made me thick of the discovery channel.,1364428800,,188,4.4

8553111,1,B00AKIPBBK,"Bad acting,awful writing... there was kung fu in this? Terrible choreography with mediocre kung fu skills. Wish I could unwatch it.",1363737600,,131,5.285714285714286
