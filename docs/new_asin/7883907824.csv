1122002,5,7883907824,"Purple Butterfly is a spectacular movie.  It stars Zhang Zhyi, one of the most popular asian film stars in America.  The movie reminds me of a great gangster film.  It has all the great action that we expect of Zhang but without her taking on her traditional martial arts role.  Its a nice change and a great film!",1108512000,,314,4.362068965517241
1122152,2,7883907824,"Francis Ford Coppola once said that if he'd had a budget of one dollar for his film BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA, he wanted to spend 95 cents on set design and costumes, with the remaining nickel spent on the screenplay.

Lou Ye's PURPLE BUTTERFLY follows that approach, although I would argue which film spent more conservatively on its writing.

The premise begins in Shanghai in 1928, a few years before the Japanese invasion. Zhang Ziyi plays Cynthia, whose Japanese boyfriend is called back to Tokyo. Coincidentally, Cynthia's brother is murdered immediately afterward for his anti-Japanese activism. She then joins a militant movement named Purple Butterfly, presumably motivated by her brother's death. Three years later, when her former boyfriend is found back in Shanghai, she is given the task of targeting him.

The film is often beautifully shot, with a lot of handheld camera movement suggesting a cinema verite style. Period design is outstandingly rendered, with lots of detail deep into the shots. The street scenes, interiors, and costumes provide a Chinese version of a film noir.

This is a real slow-burner of a movie, surprisingly devoid of substantial plot development. The film bogs down in lots of wordless interplay, suggestion, and furtive glances. The actors must carry numerous, protracted scenes in this manner, often in oddly framed, off-focus shots and extreme closeups. Scenes seem to go on and on without ever meaning very much. Even with a repertoire of expressions as varied as Zhang Ziyi possesses, the brooding never seems to end.

What perplexed me the most about this film was that its climax occurs only a quarter of the way through, turning the entire rest of the movie into a confusing muddle of flashbacks and foreshadowing. The film then ends, incongruously, with an epilogue of stock documentary footage of the Japanese invasion in 1937-38. It is some very strange cinematic decision making, adding up to one of the most disjointed movies I've ever seen.

Lou Ye is undoubtedly a skilled director, and he has a fine group to work with. But I would suggest that for his future films, he should leave the screenwriting and storyboarding to others, so he can better showcase his talent.",1129334400,16,2221,5.071232876712329
1122153,2,7883907824,"OK, so I'm a Zhang Ziyi fan.  Not a huge fan, but enough that, one day, out of sheer boredom, I decided to get this movie while surfing through Amazon.com.

The best part about this movie is that Zhang Ziyi is in it.  And that's it.  This is not one of her better movies, definitely.

The plot is not that difficult to figure out.  What is hard to figure out is how and why things happen the way they do in the movie, since nothing much makes sense.  What the filmmakers have tried to do here is disguise an incoherent and unrealistic plot as film noir, by using dense layers of atmosphere.

The story starts in 1928 in Manchuria, with Zhang's character, Cynthia, at the end of a love affair with a Japanese man, Itami, who is heading back to Japan.  Zhang appears in classic schoolgirl dress with pigtails.  In the next scene, her brother, who is involved in some sort of newspaper or anti-Japanese organization, gets murdered by a pro-Japanese terrorist. Tears from Zhang Ziyi in both scenes.

Cut to 1931, in Shanghai.  We meet Szeto, and his girlfriend Yiling.  Like an old war movie clich, this brief scene of their happiness together is meant only to set up Yiling's tragic death in the next scene.

Szeto leaves on a brief trip, and then on his return, as he hurriedly leaves the train, he accidentally grabs the jacket of a Purple Butterfly operative (presumably a professional brought in to perform the assassination of the Japanese agent Yamamoto).  Mistaken for the real assassin by the other Purple Butterfly members waiting at the train station, they hand Szeto a briefcase containing info on Yamamoto and his organization, and then chaos and shooting breaks out.  The original assassin, realizing that Szeto has taken his jacket, chases after him, and is mistaken for an enemy by the other Purple Butterfly operatives, who kill him.  Szeto is packed into a car by the Purple Butterfly operatives as they make their escape.  Yiling, who has gone to the train station to meet her boyfriend, chases after Szeto, and is shot by Cynthia, who has been watching the scene unfold.  Cynthia shoots some other people also, all to help cover the escape of the Purple Butterfly operatives who have Szeto in the car.  Just three years later, Cynthia has become a seasoned Purple Butterfly operative, with the look of a mature young woman.

Confused?  Baffled? That's only the first quarter of the movie!  Like I said, it's not hard to figure out what is happening in the movie.  What's harder to figure out is how and why things happen the way they do.  How does a schoolgirl get from Manchuria to Shanghai and in just three years is involved in killing people in public places?  Just what the heck is the Purple Butterfly organization?  Their goals and methods seem to be more along the lines of a quasi-governmental death squad rather than a resistance/liberation/terrorist organization.  But the movie states later on explicitly that they are not affiliated with the government or any other organization.  Why arrange to have this meeting and hand-off of a crucial mission assignment in a crowded, chaotic train station?  Why have the only form of identification be this non-descript suit with a Purple Butterfly over the left chest?  It seems almost to be a parody of spy movie clichs to have this sort of Mission Impossible style mission assignment go wrong like this.

The rest of the movie goes along similar lines.  The pacing of the movie is excruciatingly slow.  There is very little dialogue in this movie.  Much of the movie is filled up by long tracking shots of people walking from point A to point B to point C, as well as long close-up shots of their facial expressions.  I'm guessing that these boring interludes are meant to convey some sort of a Deep Meaning.  I got more deep meaning out of this movie, in a much shorter time, by watching it in Fast Forward mode.  8x speed was about right - I could still read the subtitles at that speed.

A few other comments:

A particularly odd feature of this movie that I noticed was that the three main male characters have this ectomorph body type that just isn't seen much anymore in either Western movies or in the Chinese martial arts movies, where the male actors are built more sturdily.  These are REALLY skinny guys, with some seriously narrow shoulders.  In a number of shots, their heads look to be much larger than their torsos, making them look like bobble-head dolls.

The final scenes are from classic film clips of war atrocities and other carnage inflicted on the Chinese civilian population by the Japanese invaders.  This is heavy duty stuff, and remains an unsettled issue in Asia to this day, a source of deep anger among the Chinese people, and continuous denial by the Japanese.  It's too important of a subject to be casually tossed in at the end of such a lightweight and confused movie as this one.",1121126400,6,4885,4.688601645123384
1122154,4,7883907824,"Purple Butterfly is Lou Ye's follow-up to his dreamy Suzhou River, a Wong Kar-Wai-esque tragic love affair. This movie is also a tale of doomed romance set in 1930s Shanghai. In some respects, this is Ye's In the Mood for Love as Purple Butterfly is also a richly textured period piece about a love affair between two people that can never be together because of the dictates of their society. It's a classic story of a couple who should be together but meet in the wrong place and time in history.

Zhang Ziyi has such a wonderful, expressive face that Ye uses so well in the movie. For example, in one scene he captures the child-like glee on her face as she spots a cute knick-knack in a store window. In another scene, he shows the soul-crushing anguish on her face as she watches her brother and his friends blown apart on the street by a terrorist.

Lou Ye's film shows how revenge is a powerful motivator that transcends politics. It is the reason why Cynthia and Szeto do what they do in the movie. Tragedy has touched them so deeply and so profoundly that revenge is the only option that they have for some kind of closure. In their eyes, those responsible must also suffer. And yet, the Purple Butterfly's conclusion suggests that world events and politics ultimately eclipses what happens to these characters and what they do. They are at the mercy of fate and the machinations of history.",1121040000,14,1400,4.573705179282869
1122155,5,7883907824,"This is just a really cool movie!  The cinematography is great and Zhang Ziyi is her usual breathtaking self.  The 122 min runtime never left me bored for a second, mainly because I was always trying to figure out what was going on - not feeling befuddled or frustrated, but enjoying trying to untangle the story.",1118102400,4,313,4.571428571428571
1122156,3,7883907824,"I bought this movie because Zhang Ziyi is in it, probably also because it came up in some Amazon customers who buy - also buy Purple Butterfly recommendation. You don't get many extra's, just subtitling for the movie (not my favorite type style but readable),a very scratchy trailer for it and some trailers for other DVD's by the same DVD company producer.

Despite Zhang Ziyi's promotion on the jacket cover for House of Flying Daggers, Hero, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, even Rush Hour 2 she is not in every part of the movie, you'll be disappointed if you expect that. I liked most of her work here, she's good at portraying emotion, but I just could not get myself into the movie.

The plotline of 1930's China and the Japanese Occupation is interesting but needed some sort of help here. It looks as if almost everything is shot through a blue lens filter on a hand held camera (someone wasn't very steady with that thing)and there were too many subplots going on. There really wasn't much dialog, it was subtitled well enough, but I had trouble keeping up with and track of what was going on. I did get the main storyline but there was also a subplot about some poor guy who accidentally gets pulled into events by being mistaken for a resistance member, I was never really clear about what was up with him. Judging by names in the film credits the Japanese characters were probably all really Japanese, not Chinese actors.

House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, even Hero are all better movies in my view- I know they were easier for me to follow along with.",1117584000,4,1586,4.617021276595745

7900091,3,7883907824,"This Zhang Ziyi film is a good movie in general. It is much more commercial than some of her previous works such as House of Flying Daggers an Touching Starlight.

7900092,4,7883907824,I'm not stupid and this movie was a lot of work to watch. The effort involved in keeping track of the characters and action in this movie prevented me from immersing myself in the story. This is a near-great movie that would be easier to understand if the plot points and characters were drawn with more care.  Hitchcock would have done the mistaken identity sub-plot with more clarity and Tarantino would have made the characters more disinctive.  This director's lack of delineation makes it hard work for an audience suddenly thrust into a period of history that most people know little or nothing about. Check out Visconti's SENSO or THE LEOPARD to see how history that is foreign to the audience is made to be more easily understood.,1342742400,2,738,4.7578125

I believe that this movie was shot before Li BingBing westernized her lovely face with plastic surgery. If you love owls, this is reason enough to enjoy Purple Butterfly.",1290384000,,354,4.446153846153846

7900096,4,7883907824,"Brilliant story of how love stuggles to grow in harsh and blistering conditions. The tale is not one told in a straightforward manner. This is what alleviates any boredom that may seemingly occur due to the somewhat slow pace. Yet Zhang Ziyi shines in all the chaos....quite a different character from the one she played in ""Road Home"". If the viewer is not accustomed to asian cinema then they may not get this movie.",1208131200,2,418,4.662162162162162
7900097,5,7883907824,"This film is deeply intense. There is often silence that is thick with meaning. The camera often tells much of the story, honing in on the actors and actresses faces ... the spartan rooms ... the city scapes/ scenes ... the commotion of workers going to and from work ... the riots, protests and rebellions ... the crowds of people at the railroad station in Shanghai. The film begins in Manchuria, the year is 1928 when Cynthia (Zhang Ziyi) a Chinese young lady has a love affair with Itami (Toru Nakamura) a Japanese young man whose father is part of a Japanese delegation who  are seeking political opportunity to destabilize the region. Times are tense,  the atmosphere is ripe for political change and explosive events. Itami is called back to Japan to serve in the military and their brief but very passionate love affair is cut short.

The film is impressionistic and surreal in how it portrays events and relationships. There are clandestine organizations at work, and it is not often clear who is involved in what until some complicated twist and turn in the plot occurs to reveal the truth. Early in the film, Cynthia's brother is ambushed by a Japanese underground group. He is murdered before her eyes. This causes her to join the ""Purple Butterfly"" a clandestine Chinese resistance group who try to bring about justice for China and eliminate the Japanese threat.

Zhang Ziyi does an outstanding performance in this serious role. After witnessing her brother's murder, she takes on a false identity, Hui Deng, a nurse who works at Marion Hospital. Hers is a stellar performance along with Itami played by Toru Nakamura. Hui Deng participates in an assassination at the railroad station. There Szeto loses his lady love, accidentally killed in the crossfire. He is also given a briefcase by mistake which puts him  in the middle of some very serious problems. Szeto becomes heavily embroiled in the activities against the Japanese but he falls into a trap which puts his life at risk. He is in a very precarious position. He makes a deal, it saves his life but ulitimately because of the direction he went ... he ends up losing it.

Itami returns to Shanghai to take over as the leader of the Japanese movement. He is replacing Mr. Yoshikawa who is being recalled to Japan. Itami is managing the upheaval and creating more dissension and rioting, through his spy network and underground operations. The Japanese want to control Shanghai. Cynthia again enters Itami's life and becomes personally involved renewing their love affair but with ulterior motives. However, Itami is not who he used to be and neither is Cynthia the same person she was. Unknown to Itami, she is now an assassin and revolutionary. Itami asks Cynthia to return to Tokyo with him, he even arranges for legal authorization with his boss. Itami and Cynthia attend  a party at the Japanese Club, where they dance to a very haunting and beautiful Chinese tune, called ""A Garden Bridge"". The events which transpire at the party are jaw-dropping. The twists and turns of the plot are unpredictable and very satisfying. The ending will astonish the viewer ... At the very end of the film, there is actual black and white film footage of the Japanese invasion of Nanking around 1937 which brings *full* closure on the film. This is a most astonishing complex story with exceptionally artistic cinematography and great acting. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1175385600,19,3431,4.884879725085911
7900098,3,7883907824,"To enjoy the Chinese-French film `Purple Butterfly,' some patience is required. To follow the story was hard for me (and I am a Japanese who knows the historical background of the film), but once you understand what is going on, you see the merits of this period romance. First, remember the following four characters.

Zhang Ziyi is Ding Hui/Cynthia, a Chinese girl whose brother is a member of one underground organization protesting against the Japanese invasion. The time is set in 1928, and the place is northern China, then called Manchuria. But one tragic thing happens to her brother, and she is also drawn into the activity of the organization.

Toru Nakamura, Japanese actor, plays Itami a Japanese whose father works as an interpreter in China. But young Itami must leave this country and his love Cynthia because he was drafted into the military service by the Japanese army. Three years later, Itami comes back to Shanghai as Japanese military officer, who had been trained for espionage in China. Now Itami meets Cynthia again in this city, but this time Cynthia's love seems to have a hidden agenda for she is meetig her new lover Xie Ming (Yuanzheng Feng).

In addition to the main story above, there is a sub-plot. Lie Ye (`Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress') plays Situ, a young, ordinary Chinese man. He and Yiling (Bingbing Li) are innocent sweethearts, but when Situ is mistaken for someone else at the crowded station, a tragic thing happens.

[Noir in China] The fates of the characters are closely intertwined with the film's complicated plot. This film can be called a romance, but it would be more correct to call it a noir film. The images themselves are beautiful, and the production designs are realistic, but the murky photography and the shaky camera may not be your taste. Though there are shooting scenes, and you can see Zhang Ziyi shooting a gun - far cry from the image we associate with her (oh, and let's forget `Rush Hour 2,' shall we?) - the sequences are sometimes confusing, and probably that is one of the reasons for the general complaint about the film.

Whatever your reaction may be, the film proves that Zhang Ziyi is an immensely gifted actress, but I am not sure if her acting here is her best. But to me, though the time allotted to her character was not long enough, Bingbing Li as young telephone operator is more impressive. There is one brief but memorable scene, in which Bingbing Li quietly sits in a streetcar as if unaware of the riotous street outside. The contrast between the two worlds is represented in this short sequence, and in the middle of the battles and the deaths there is a woman who is clearly in love. Bingning Li literally becomes the image of love, which is too fragile in the time of war.

Writer/Director Lou Ye succeeds in creating such remarkable sequences resonant with the film's serious themes, but the jumbling of the time order and the confusing relations between the characters often do harm to them. `Purple Butterfly' is for the viewers who can be patient with the slow-moving and complicated story. It will be rewarding experience only after you put the pieces in the right places.",1138579200,7,3178,4.7690909090909095
