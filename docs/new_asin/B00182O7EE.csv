3411389,5,B00182O7EE,"I was unsure of what to expect from this anime. It was mostly a whim purchase based on a desire for some good, character-driven storylines. I couldn't be more pleased.

The story takes place at Lillian Girls' Academy, a realm where decorum and grace are stressed, and the rules are relaxed somewhat in favour of a mentoring (senpai/kouhai) system. In this system, an older student chooses a girl to become her petite soeur, or little sister. The bond between sisters is meant to be strong, as the younger learns from the older and the older nurtures the younger.

The story is mostly told from the perspective of Fukuzawa Yumi, a young first-year student who's thrust headfirst into the emotional politics of the soeur system from almost the moment she arrives at the school.

The storyline is beautiful and romantic, and the characters are given a depth of feeling that's typical of good shoujo anime. Those looking for yuri will be disappointed. This is not an erotic tale of the secret love of women at an all-girls' school. This is simply pure romance.

And best of all, there's not a ninja, gun, robot, sword, spaceship, or monster in sight.",1219190400,9,1146,4.7727272727272725
3411390,5,B00182O7EE,"I loved this season of Maria Watches Over Us. It was excellent the characters are deep and you begin to really care for them after just a few episodes. I will definitely buy the next season when it comes out.

Alright now that I got out the initial part, I wanted to say that this is NOT a yuri anime in anyway and if that is what you are looking for you came to the wrong place. This is a very sweet story about Yumi and her Onee-sama (Sachiko). Although this can be defined as such an anime because of the lack of men accept in certain episodes.

When watching this you start to make a connection to Yumi in the fact that she is basically a regular person that had something unique happen to her basically by coincidence. After which she rejects it at first, but after sometime she begins to accept it and live life with this unique circumstance. Anyway, I would recommend this series to anyone that wants to see a good drama, and/or romance.",1218326400,,944,4.297752808988764
3411391,5,B00182O7EE,"Based on a series of light novels by Konno Oyuki, ""Maria-sama ga Miteru"" is the story of an average girl, Fukuzawa Yumi, who is drawn into the rarified world of her school's Student Council. Led by the elegant and refined three Rosas, the Council seems to live in a world of its own that most students can never touch.

Until one morning, one of the most unapproachable of the Council members, Ogasawara Sachiko, unexpectedly fixes Yumi's uniform tie, plunging Yumi into a complex test of her affections and allegiance.

The season box set has two subtitle tracks - one with Japanese style honorifics, and one without. It comes with video extras - shorts that spoof the ""making of"" the series, and a cel phone charm as a physical extra. The translation is very decent, and the menu is very simple and straightforward. It's an excellent bargain at the price, as well.

With a romantic setting, a little Yuri flavoring, a lot of humor and a dose of pure shoujo fantasy, Maria Watches Over Us is one of the best series to ever be adapted into an anime.",1217721600,15,1049,4.598930481283422
3411392,5,B00182O7EE,"I became a fan of ""Maria-Sama ga Miteru"" (aka ""Marimite"" - I am gonna have a hard time calling it by its new US name) several years ago via fansubs over the internet. As soon as it was licensed and put up for pre-order, I put in for my copy.

Marimite is easily my favorite anime of all time (and I watch a wide variety of anime). It's an elegant shoujo drama; nothing huge really happens but every event is a catalyst for character development, something which this series has in spades. I honestly have not seen many series - even live action - that have the level of character development that this anime has over the course of its (so far) three seasons. I chalk that up  to Marimite being based on well-written light novels of the same name by Konno Oyuki.

The stories themselves are simple and are slow-paced, much like the setting at a Catholic girls-school where moving calmly is preferred. The drama is more realistic than most anime, though kicked up a notch for effect:  Yumi is torn between watching her idol from afar or coming so close to her as to feel diminished herself; Yoshino struggles with a heart condition that prevents her from actively being the spitfire she is in personality; Rei, Yoshino's cousin, must get over her need to protect Yoshino and let her be the firey person she is; elegant Sachiko must learn its okay to rely on others... and more. ;)

The characters themselves are not cookie-cutter replicas you have seen before, each becoming more three-dimensional as the episodes unfold stories highlighting each character (well, if you include season 2). Once season 2 is released and you watch it with its flash-back episodes and go back to review the entire series, you suddenly gain insight into why different characters (like Sei) act the way they do. It just shows how well-written the entire thing is, that it was largely planned ahead of time. No episode is a stand-alone; they all mesh together to paint a portrait of this group of girls who we watch bloom and grow into their own strengths over the course of the series.

The animation itself is very good and pleasing to look at. On a few occasions you get an odd, slight shift in style or weird character proportions but they aren't so bad as to take away from the story. Flowing hair and uniforms and details in the changes of season are all well used.

The music is classical, no ill-fitting pop tunes. This minimal approach adds to the air of elegance and propriety of the school, as well as to highlight that despite such expectations, our characters are colorful people, breaking molds as they go.

Humor is realistic and smart; there is no use of chibi or stylised faces (except for one occasion I can think of).

Right Stuf has stated that this release will include two subtitle tracks - one with everything translated and another with honorifics intact (yay!).

Lastly, for those of us so inclined, there is yuri content, largely in the form of Sei, who once fell for another student at Lillian (their school). Two episodes are devoted to this. Overall, the series is quite gay-friendly and though it doesn't dwell on the topic, it is respectful and more realistic than most series out there that use such elements as service.",1214611200,27,3228,4.647368421052631
8268341,5,B00182O7EE,Love this anime series. Engaging slice of life drama with unique artwork and well developed characters. Season one sets up the story perfectly.,1522368000,,143,5.260869565217392
8268342,5,B00182O7EE,I bought this because I loved watching it online. I could've just kept doing that but why should I have to wait forever to load it expeashaly for such a great anime. It's nice and slow perfect for night when your trying to go to sleep.,1426550400,,235,4.130434782608695
8268343,5,B00182O7EE,"The series is all about friendship and the strong bonds between students who take up a role in being someone's ""sister"". Good show to watch, family-friendly.",1379548800,2,157,5.076923076923077
8268344,4,B00182O7EE,"This is a quality show if you are into this type of anime.  It is subtitled first of all so if you like only english dubbed versions this is not for you.  This is a yuri anime in the true sense of the word.  Not perverted, just romantic friendships.  It is simply a show based off the characters and their personalities, how they interact and the relationships they form.  The entire show takes place in an all girls school and it is very dry.  There is goind to be no real action to speak of.  It is all character driven.  The animation is very nice and the characters are very defined.
  The main character is a very sweet innocent girl as defined in many anime.  She will really not be able to cheat or decieve others and has their best interests at heart.  She then becomes the little sister of an upperclassman who has a more stern yet caring nature almost by accident.  The story develops on the friendship they form and the friendships of their fellow student council members.  It's a very innocent show by many standards and may not be for all.",1332201600,,1052,4.355670103092783
8268345,4,B00182O7EE,"A cute little series about girls who attend an all-girls church school that uses a three step soeur* system. The story revolves around two girls in particular who become soeurs and how they change and grow with each other as well as those around them.

8268347,5,B00182O7EE,"I have watched this series from mid point of Printmeps (Spring ,Season Two) through season Three  Summer on Anime Network on demand through my Cable system, my only beef with Anime Network is that they don't show the English Credits after the next episode preview on on Demand on TV,I have also been renting this from Netflix,and I am up to season 2 Disc 3. I own Season one, and plan to purchase the rest of the series  from Right Stuf/Nozomi Entertainment who have the US rights for this series.

The Collection for this series consists of 13 30 Min. episodes for Seasons 1,2,& 4 on a 4 DVD box set each, and 3 DVDs for Season 3(Summer) which contains 5 52 Min. OAV episodes

This is a very enjoyable wonderful series and I am looking forward to Season Four when it comes out, this series has very beautiful Artwork,Animation,Story Line, Music and Characters that you want to care about, Yumi and her friends and All the Lady Roses. The Bonus Material included in this set include Specials on each disc entitled ""Don't Tell Mother Maria"", which are a more Cartoon type of short that is an Out take/Blooper reel in which a part of a scene is done starting with the Clapper/Marker Board then the scene starts with rather funny results(a blown line, a bad take or mispronunciation of a term in the 1st. one Yumi mispronounces en bouton ( French for Rose Bud )
after Sachiko is walking away after having retied Yumi's Scarf on her Uniforms Sailor Collar and is supposed to saying to herself that Sachiko is the Rosa Chinesis'(Red Rose) en bouton and instead says Bondon and the take has to be done over after Yoriko explains the correct pronunciation to her and she repeats over and over loudly then stops exhausted and the scene ends(you have to see it to understand it).
Other Bonus materials on the DVD are Character Biographies and Liner Notes ( translators notes) and explanation of certain things in parts of the episodes.

These DVD's come with Two Subtitle Tracks on them, one is the English Dialog Subtitle track and the other one is the English Dialog With the Japanese honorifics included(Prefix, Suffixes for names and etc.)such as Onee-Sama( Std. dialog translates this as ""Dear Sister""),another example is when referring to an Upper Classmen the Suffix ""Sama"" is used, example: Sachiko-Sama, Rei-Sama,in the std. dialog this is Lady Sachiko, Lady Rei,these two characters are the en boutons and Little Sisters of the Red Rose and the Yellow Rose of the Yamayuri Council which is the Student Council of the High School Division of Lillian Girl's Academy of which the three Lady Roses(Red, White and Yellow Roses) are the Officers of the Council.

This an Excellent Series well worth watching and owning, it has its funny moments such as when Sai Sato the current Rosa Gigantea(White Rose) sneaks up behind Yumi and Hugs her, causing Yumi to let out a loud shriek as she tries to get away from Rosa Gigantea in the process, another example is in the Third Season (Summer) during the Lunch Break of the School's Sports Fest, Yumi takes Sachiko over to meet her Parents for the first time, just as they have each taken a bite of food and start choking on it just as Yumi introduces Sachiko to them and they're trying to swallow their food and respond to the introduction.

To quote an old TV commercial ""Try it you'll like it."" and believe me you will like it!

I give this Entire series 5 Stars, for more information on this series go to :[...], you will find lots of information along with Trailers for each season of the series along with Wall Papers and Avatars and etc.",1274486400,,3582,4.647709320695102
8268348,5,B00182O7EE,"When I first started watching Maria watch over us season 1, I thought OMG another teen Japanese anime; but this show was different it had a definite twist to it, it reminded me the classic ""Tom Browns school days"" but for girls and it was subtitled and no English dub, I almost didn't finish watching the first episode but when it was over I couldn't wait to see the next, by the end of that first season I was hooked. If you watch or collect anime this series is a must watch and have on your list.",1264809600,2,499,4.154639175257732
8268349,5,B00182O7EE,Love this show even though it may be a bit confusing if you don't understand it.,1252972800,,80,4.0625
8268350,5,B00182O7EE,"While people have no doubt seen the whole ""girls in love triangles"" plot before (maybe not with girls), this anime brings so much excellent romantic drama.

So far, ""Maria Watches Over Us"" is a winner for yuri fans, with gentle romance stories involving Catholic girls in high school.

Catholic girls in America would probably not consider lesbian romance as acceptable, but ""Maria Watches Over Us"" manages to squeeze in emotional romance without any dispositions at all.

Yumi Fukuzawa is a shy first-year student at the Lilian Girl's Academy. After praying at the statue of the virgin Mary, a third-year student named Sachiko Ogasawara ties Yumi's neckerchief. However, a photographer named Tsutako took a picture of Yumi and Sachiko together. She will only give the picture back to Yumi if Tsutako gets permission from the Sachiko to display the photo at the school's upcoming festival.

Of course, Yumi has no idea that Sachiko is a member of the Yamayuri council, the student council of Lilian Girl's Academy. Sachiko also proposes to give a rosary to Yumi, so that she can be Sachiko's petite soeur, or little sister. Yumi is too shy to accept at first, but as she bonds with her friends in the Yamayuri council, she can't help but love her new family of big sisters in the Yamayuri.

This is a wonderful series with a surprising amount of drama and emotional romance. One would never think that the Yamayuri council would feature so many thoughtful stories of romance. Sachiko's conflict with her family forces her to find a new relationship with Yumi. Yoshino Shimazu wants to get a heart transplant, but worries about her grande soeur (older sister), Rei Hasukura. And Sei Sato has a dark past, a young, forbidden romance.

This box covers episodes 1-13. This series also features an awesome special feature named ""Don't Tell Maria,"" which includes hilarious bloopers of each of the episodes. Although the series is a little pricey at $45, it's still one heck of a bargain, considering that anime fans receive this excellent anime with great special feature for almost every episode.",1235174400,,2092,4.962857142857143
