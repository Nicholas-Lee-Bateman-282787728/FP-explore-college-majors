8430683,5,B004IG28TS,"While i only reviewed part of the first DVD, what i saw was excellent quality instruction by RKCs eager to dissect the fundamentals of the kettlebell movements and convey safe and effective technique.  I found myself rewinding and listening to the subtleties of the swing, clean, press, snatch, get up and more, in coherent, physiology-based terms.  While watching, I had a light bell in hand and went through the movements, having many ""aha"" moments.  While i am a neophyte, having started with KBs about 3 months ago, i think the level of detail and instruction would benefit anyone swinging these hunks of iron around.  It is all in the form and technique, after all.  While not a ""glamorous"" setting, this DVD is a gem.  And in the world of kettlebell fluff ( see the polished fare for consumption on Collage Video-), this DVD is a must have.  For those of you who have Pavel's ""Enter the Kettlebell"", this DVD will fill in the gaps of the finer, nuanced  points of the movements.  You get to the ""granular"" level.  Example- the swing- i thought i was doing it properly until it was explained to pull the bell downward between the legs forcefully to load the hamstrings.  I thought i was doing a good job snapping my glutes to fly the bell forward......

Again. this is a vid of a small workshop, so if you are looking for a glam setting follow- along, go to Lauren Brooks' other excellent DVDs.  But the detail covered here is for those looking to break the movements down, into bone and muscle and nerve.",1308441600,14,1510,4.58955223880597
