8167593,5,B000MAZVWK,"Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of Hong Kong. All the elements click: a terrific script (by French writers Julien Carbon and Laurent Courtiaud) that even manages to subvert the odd clich?, reliably imaginative direction by Johnnie To, and excellent central performances by Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan, the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody (especially in his exasperated reactions to his superior's abysmal negotiating skills). The supporting cast is fine too, with Yo Yo Mung making a strong impression in a tiny role, and even the often histrionic Waise Lee (looking remarkably, and very aptly, like a bald Andy Lau) reining it in to good effect. It's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set-up - with only a few weeks to live, Lau engages in a criminal game with Wan's cop with no easily apparent motive - and just sit back and enjoy the ride: it's certainly worth the fare. It also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies, and played in a mere three scenes (the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of filmmaking I've seen in ages). There's also a fine score by Raymond Wong as well. The most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years.

It was inevitable that after setting the benchmark so high with the first film that Running Out of Time 2 would be a disappointment, and it is, though it's still an above average Hong Kong thriller. Once again it's a game of cat and mouse rather than a collection of action scenes, but this time round new writers Kin Yee Au and Nai-Hoi Yau give Ching Wan Lau much less to work with and the film seriously suffers from the lack of genuine emotional involvement of the original. It's almost a film of incidental pleasures - a couple of playful nods to the original in rooftop and taxi scenes, a nice part for Johnnie To regular Lam Suet as a phenomenally unlucky compulsive gambler, a chase that drags on so long both pursuer and pursued stop for a drink of water and an ice cream and one terrific twist over the location of a ransom drop that the film is never able to top. It also has the best CGI effects I've ever seen in a Hong Kong film, with some remarkably well-integrated shots of an eagle flying through the streets of Hong Kong. But Ekin Cheung's mastermind just isn't interesting enough and the ending is too far fetched to work.",1232236800,,2480,4.474613686534217
