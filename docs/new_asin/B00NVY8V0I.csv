6681242,4,B00NVY8V0I,"Love in Venice, lots of Love, no Venice.
The DVD pacakge shows Andre Riey and Venice buildings.
For me, I was buying a concert in Venice, like the other ones in some many places
but this one is another more of the dozens of concerts given in Mastrich, his native town, and with
music from different latin countries including by the way,  Italy. Even the same zamba at the end.
Great show, good music but no Venice.",1416787200,,414,4.376623376623376

6681246,5,B00NVY8V0I,"This DVD is really terrific! This concert will definitely be included in my collection! I'm sorry to pour a little salt on some open wounds, if you will, wherein some people may be dissatisfied with this DVD but.......I would like to see larger formatted subtitles as I'm 70+ years old and reading such is like focusing eyesight through a keyhole in door.

Mention has been made regarding too many shots of audience in filming. Personally, I like it. I'm not going to question their reason for such. It's like a lawyer telling a Chef how to do their job.

I definitely will recommend this DVD to my friends and to anyone who enjoys finer music..",1416096000,21,645,4.6

6681275,5,B00NVY8V0I,"Great visual transfer - mediocre sound recording. It sounds remote and lacks definition among the instruments. Also, the ""say everything in German and then in English"" made me feel I was a captive at the United Nations opening assembly. It's call 'EDITING'; discover it, use it.",1438819200,,278,5.065217391304348
