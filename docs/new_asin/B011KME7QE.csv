7333938,5,B011KME7QE,In my humble opinion.,1449964800,2,21,4.5
7333939,4,B011KME7QE,"Eveleigh (Isla Fisher) Was in a car accident and got a nasty bump on the head and killed an infant. It wasn't her fault, or so everyone claims. Her husband David (Anson Mount) manages to get own vineyard and her pregnant. The neighbors feel like something out of ROSEMARY'S BABY. She thinks the neighbor is producing meth, but he claims it is medicinal olive oil, something my aromatherapist swears by. The old house also has a history. Eveleigh has visions and hears things too which they didn't work into the title. This starts off as your typical boring poltergeist haunting and then at 54 minutes into the film, when you have your first death, things get interesting. 4 stars for the ending and being able to bring the story home.

Cast includes Eva Longoria, Jim Parsons and Gillian Jacobs.

7333940,4,B011KME7QE,"Eveleigh (Isla Fisher), moves to a vineyard with her husband David (Anson Mount, Hell on Wheels), she's pregnant and they're hoping for new start after a car accident that killed another child. She however has stopped taking her meds which had previously helped with dealing with the aftermath of the accident, and is starting to experience visions, objects flying around the room, noises such as the door banging, wine bottles exploding, and sees a guy in a hoodie. All these things disappear as soon as she summons David. She is also convinced the guy next door is a meth cook. David is getting increasingly frustrated by her paranoia and embarrassing escalating behaviour. He wants her doctor (Jim Parsons, Big Bang Theory), to put her back on her meds for her own safety. Her friend from pregnant yoga (Gillian Jacobs, Community), tells her not to give in to her husband's wants, it's her body etc. As the terror gets worse for Eveleigh she wants David to abandon the new place, of course he doesn't want to. Will they survive?

This is your standard plot for the most part for this type of set up. Isla Fisher is the main actor in this one, the film revolves around her and she does a pretty good job. The other actors, including Anson Mount, don't have that many scenes. If you're buying this because you're a fan of one of them, you may be disappointed that they simply don't have that much screen time. If however you just want a good movie, this isn't a bad one, and the ending is a nice surprise that makes the film even more enjoyable so I won't give that away for you. With so many actors who are the main character from TV shows in the minor roles the movie became more of a he's from this show, she's from that show game. It was also obvious that those actors made this when actively shooting their TV shows, or close enough to it as they all still had the same haircuts and looked the way they do on those shows. So you're kind of waiting for David to mention he's got to go build the railroad, Sadie to mention she's got to do something at Greendale and the doctor to mention to Eveleigh that she is sitting in his spot. Even Eva Longoria seems like she is just visiting and has to get back to her house on Desperate Housewives, although obviously that show has been over for a while.",1447372800,12,2300,4.4373522458628845
7333941,3,B011KME7QE,"Good story and well acted, but delivered essentially no scares at all. It wasn't a complete waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it for scary movie night.",1465516800,,157,4.642857142857143

7333943,3,B011KME7QE,"I think this movie had a solid plot, though it was rather predictable for me...not so much the supernatural twist, but the climax was an easily predicted formula. I think the sets and atmosphere (vineyard, quaint, upscale town) were different and lovely. The only issue I really had was the direction of the acting...The actors all felt a bit awkward and false with each other and they made a lot of stupid survival decisions. I feel if that were different it could have been a much greater film. The upside to the supernatural aspect only really served the heroine...it seemed like others should have benefitted. That said, I love weekend horror/supernatural films and this was decent.",1460160000,,686,4.922413793103448

7333955,3,B011KME7QE,"VISIONS  is a psychological thriller that does not quite fulfill its potential. The story for the most part meanders and only picks up pace towards the latter part of the film when someone dies. Isla Fisher portrays Eveleigh, a young woman who was recently in a car accident that caused the death of a woman and an infant. Although its not her fault, Eveleigh feels responsible, and to get her mind off things, her husband David (Anson Mount) purchases a vineyard in a remote location. Eveleigh is now pregnant and feels a presence in her new home, but everyone around her assures her things are all in her mind, and her husband even convinces her to take medication to prevent her hallucinations.

The people in the community are strange and Eveleigh begins to wonder if something sinister is afoot. Her only friend is a fellow mom-to-be that she meets at prenatal yoga class. Things escalate and there is a final twist towards the end. It is this twist that brings the story together, but for me, it was a case of too little, too late. VISIONS has shades of ROSEMARYS BABY, and for a while, I even thought it echoed THE SKELETON KEY, but what it really proved to be was a low budget Lifetime type thriller.",1455408000,4,1208,4.56221198156682

8724505,1,B011KME7QE,"Is it me or do Isla Fisher and Amy Adams look alike? I promise you that not only do they they look alike, you might even convince me that they are the same person. Except I'm sure that Amy Adams wouldn't be caught dead in this drivel called ""Visions.""
in ""Visions,"" Fisher stars as a woman who was in a car accident that caused the death of another woman's baby. Even though the accident was not Fisher's fault, she spiraled into depression and so a year later, she and her hubby buy a vineyard to gain a fresh perspective and start life anew. The other life that's new is the baby growing inside Fisher's womb. Yes, she is preggo and justifiably intent on ensuring that the bambino is healthy, so she quits her anti-depressants. But as soon as she does, she is assaulted by visions and apparitions. Is Fisher going crazy? Is the house haunted? Or is there more going on?
Was not everything about the movie so predictable and wooden we might care. But this is a thriller without much in the way of thrills and scares. Red herrings abound but the ending will be clear long before the movie ends. And there were a few too many gaps in logic for this viewer. Nevertheless, Isla Fisher is easy to watch and she graces almost every scene (even if she isn't given much to do in them). For me, a better vision would be a vision of loveliness ... like Isla Fisher or Amy Adams for that matter. Both shine brighter than this dreck.",1475625600,,1422,4.369811320754717

Except maybe that there's no excessive nudity/sex, overdone CGI, needless explosions, vulgarity, or gore. It's a sci-fi thriller. And a damned good one. Better than 95% of the crap in theaters or on TV.",1467158400,,365,4.382352941176471
8724510,4,B011KME7QE,"A decent horror film. I watched this at random on Netflix while browsing their selection of thrillers and was pleasantly surprised.

Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, I realized, 'Oh, this is a remake of Rosemary's Baby.' And I maintained that viewpoint until the last fifteen minutes of the movie when everything took a very unexpected turn.

I'm not a big fan of remakes, especially when the originals are classics as-is, and I'm honestly not even a big fan of Rosemary's Baby. But I kept watching because of the setting. This newly-expecting couple just bought a vineyard, so the scenery was a nice surprise.

Then there were some familiar elements from Rosemary's Baby: demonic-seeming chants, neighbors overly concerned with the expectant mother's unborn child, everyone telling the pregnant woman to take special medicine...

But the ending really did have a surprise twist, and you didn't know which way it was going to go up until the end.

I don't think an R rating is warranted. I can't remember any particularly bad language. There's some mild gore with violence at the end but there's no nudity or even scenes of cult worship like you might expect.

It held my interest and I can say I genuinely enjoyed the film. I would watch it again and recommend it to people like me, who have a hard time finding actually enjoyable scary movies on Netflix.",1466985600,,1369,4.829059829059829
