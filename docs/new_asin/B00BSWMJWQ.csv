5670801,4,B00BSWMJWQ,"""Survive and Advance"" is another stunning documentary in the ESPN Films: 30 for 30 series and tells the story of North Carolina State University's 1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball championship title.  Told through the eyes of the players and staff, it's a recollection of wild, improbable success and a homage to one of the finest coaches to ever set foot on the hardwood, Jim Valvano.

As a documentary, and this holds true with most of the 30 for 30 projects I've seen, it's masterfully done.  This is important because as any fan of documentaries will tell you, an outstanding director can make any subject matter interesting.  My point here is that sports fan will obviously find value in this film, but it shouldn't be passed over by non sports fans, either.  There's a message here that transcends athletics and it's presented beautifully.

For those unaware, Jim Valvano died of cancer in 1993.  ""Survive and Advance"", while certainly based on a basketball championship, shows its real beauty in the requiem given to his passing.  Coach Valvano was a sensational, vivacious man who pulled his team to victory through humor and love.  And it's still written on the faces of these players.  They miss him and their recollections were strong enough to bring me to tears with them on a few occasions.  It was moving.

The only problem I had with the film, and it's why I'm sitting at four stars, is that there wasn't much to be said for Lorenzo Charles.  The players had gathered in the first place, I believe, to mourn his 2011 passing.  They toast in his memory and speak briefly of his game-winning dunk, but aside from that and a quick mention of the bus accident that took his life, there wasn't much said.  I could be missing something, but it felt like a void had opened up at the start of the program that was never adequately filled concerning Lorenzo Charles.  For me, it detracted from the doc's value, but it's only my opinion.

That being said, I recommend buying this title.  During Valvano's powerful ESPY award speech, he said that every day we should all do three things: laugh, think, and cry.  I can tell you that during these 90-some minutes, I did all three.

Thank you for your time.

Aside from being a tear jerker, it does a wonderful job of bringing back a reunion, 30 year, of the players, their commentary[from both teams], snippets of that 1983 season, Valvano, and of course the Wolfpack's monumental Final Four victory over that great Houston team anchored by Olajuwon and Drexler.

5670845,5,B00BSWMJWQ,"I've watched many, if not most of the 30 for 30 series, and no episode has left me as moved as this one did.

The main description is the story of the 1983 National Champion Basketball team from North Carolina State. And this could have focused on that, with a lot of game highlights, explanations of how some guy set a great pick, etc. But this film goes far beyond that. It's as if the games take a back seat to the incredible story of Jim Valvano, how he brought the team together through great adversity, and how many times they Survived and Advanced when they really had no business being on the court with the other team.

Dereck Whittenburg was a Senior on that team, and the producer of the film. Rarely does a director have such first hand knowledge of a story he is telling. DW did a superb job.

This is a film about life, the bad breaks it gives us and why we should never ever give up.

My wife hates sports, but sat there spellbound for all 1 hour and 40 minutes of this film , and later thanked me for sharing it with her. .

Just like in the book by Napoleon Hill, ""Think and Grow Rich"", the key power phrase is ""WHATEVER THE MIND CAN CONCEIVE AND BELIEVE, IT CAN ACHIEVE"".  This documentary is the living proof that this concept is what works. This entire team was driven to success because they BELIEVED!!  This is a biblical concept!  Awesome documentary and this is a must see for anyone aspiring to achieve goals that most say are unattainable.  UNBELIEVEABLE that this team went through and winning all those final games by 1 point to keep advancing.  I love Jim Valvano for what he did to do drive this team to reach the unreachable goal.

It's about claiming what is yours.

Lots of reminiscences and insights from the players are combined with fascinating explorations of the inimitable Jim Valvano - his unique personality, his close relations with players, his inspiring battle with cancer. Yeah, the Valvano scenes during that battle are interspersed with basketball from about 10 years earlier, which is a little confusing; hence, I would have given the movie 4.5 stars if possible, but I'm happy to ""round up"".

I knew the names of the main NC State players, but little about them as people. (A couple of standouts: Dereck Whittenburg, who also produced the film, is a font of information, and Thurl Bailey is strikingly articulate.) I knew their championship game with Houston went down to the wire, but I'd forgotten the series of comebacks and cliffhangers that NC State had to survive to reach that game!

You'll enjoy the story regarding the March Madness, but even more moving was the story about N.C. State's head coach, Jim Valvano. Valvano had a storied career as a basketball coach, and became an announcer for ESPN/ABC; he suffered from cancer shortly after leaving coaching and this story is about his struggle as well.

Called ""The Cardiac Kids"" because they kept winning games by one point with like 7 seconds left in overtime against teams considered by all to far outmatch them.  Produced some seventeen years afterward by the player considered the heart and soul of the team, much of it told by the players at a warm-hearted, hilarious reunion, their final achievement is depicted in a major television retrospective as one of the most striking moments of the 20th Century.  I value it, too, for showing the kind of genuine affection and mutual respect between black and white made possible by sports.  I watched it with a close black friend, who said at the end that she valued it ""for showing black men in such a positive light.""  Recommended highly.

5670877,4,B00BSWMJWQ,This film by ESPN did Coach V justice. He is a testiment to how all coaches should approach teaching young people.

5670888,5,B00BSWMJWQ,"A truly remarkable story, even for those who are not sports fans.
The bittersweet recollections of the surviving members of North Carolina State's 1983 NCAA Championship basketball team, gathered in reunion for only the second time since improbably attaining their title, offers a movingly inspiring story of those players' grit and determination to win that accolade. But more so, the film presents a marvelous portrait of NC State's memorable coach, Jim Valvano, who died of cancer 10 years after that team's victory. As middle aged men, the players now look back with pride and incredulity at their singular accomplishment - their love and respect for one another clearly shows through. But they all reflect on the extraordinarily special person their late coach had been, how effective he was in lifting them to achieve their amazing victory and what a vividly inspiring presence he remains.
The life lessons these players took from their coach - and which continue to resonate through memory of Jim Valvano's courage, love of life and great good humor - are inspiring to anyone. The insightful nuggets of wisdom Valvano imparted (and which resonate in this excellent documentary) have applicability far beyond the arena. A story like this helps explain the powerful and enduring attraction sport offers and why, at its finest, a game can transcended the mechanics of on-court competition and become a wonderful metaphor for meaningfully living one's life, battling adversity and long odds, remaining steadfast in having faith in oneself and persevering to ultimately triumph.
In Coach Valvano's stirring words (as cancer was taking his life), ""Don't give up, don't ever give up!""",1369958400,5,1684,5.263940520446097

When you're watching this film, you are actually watching a miracle unfold. Jimmy V. taught his players to dream big and believe in themselves. The 83 N.C. State team was destined to win an NCAA championship. You will understand why when you watch this uplifting DVD. There are a lot of great life lessons in the well made documentary. I would recommend this to all my friends.",1367452800,,537,4.663157894736842
5670893,4,B00BSWMJWQ,I totally agree with T. Hunt.  Where is Lorenzo Charles? There should've been more about the young man considering this film probably would not have been made without his play at the end of the game? Was this guy paying attention or what? One of the best 30 for 30 films I have seen but unfortunately it is lacking something. I GENEROUSLY gave it 4 stars.,1365638400,,355,4.378787878787879
