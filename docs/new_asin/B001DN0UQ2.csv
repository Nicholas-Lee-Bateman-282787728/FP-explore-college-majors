8294307,3,B001DN0UQ2,"Claymore: Chapter 1 - The Burden of the Blade is a DVD that contains the first five episodes of the series.  The episodes of Claymore included on the disc are: ""Great Sword,"" ""The Black Card,"" ""The Darkness in Paradise,"" ""Clare's Awakening,"" and ""Teresa of the Faint Smile.""

There are four special features included on the disc.  The first extra is audio commentary for ""Great Sword,"" the first episode of the series.  The second bonus feature is trailers for other DVD releases from FUNimation Entertainment.  The trailers that are included in the ""Trailers"" menu of the ""Extras"" section are promotional pieces for Black Blood Brothers, Basilisk, Jyu-Oh-Sei, Vexile, Kitaro, xxxHolic, Claymore, and Darker Than Black.

The next feature is labeled as ""Cast Auditions.""  These are the auditions for the English dub voices for the following characters: Clare, Teresa, Rubel, Sid, and Yomi.  When you choose which audition you want to hear, a still image of the character is shown on the screen, with the name of the character and the voice actor superimposed on the bottom of the screen.  The audio is run over the still image.  In this feature, the audio runs anywhere from thirty seconds to one minute in length.  The final feature on the disc is ""Textless Songs.""  This feature includes textless versions of the opening and closing credits.

Overall, Claymore: Chapter 1 - The Burden of the Blade is a decent release for a single disc DVD release.  Personally, I thought the ""Cast Auditions"" bonus feature was a rather unique and interesting extra to include on the disc.  If you're a fan of Claymore, this would be a good item to purchase if you're willing to buy an anime series as single volumes of DVDs, rather than buying a DVD box set.  However, it should be noted that the individual discs run anywhere between $20 and $30 each.",1257811200,,1837,4.858520900321543
8294308,5,B001DN0UQ2,"Claymore is one of my favorite anime. Up until the end of the first season (the only season out right now) the story parralels the manga, and still holds it's meaning from one end to the other as far as I remember.

I especially love as a woman, that the Claymore are warriors instead of sex symbols. It is sometimes hard to find anime not focused on fan service *sigh* so I really charished this story.

All of the characters are very compelling, and it has great japanese voice actors, not sure about the subs on this copy, or the dubs, if they have them.",1244592000,,557,4.295238095238095
8294309,5,B001DN0UQ2,This first installment follows the manga quite well.  So far it has not strayed from the original storyline.  It's wonderful to see some of these fight scenes in such top quality animation.,1240617600,2,189,4.875
8294310,4,B001DN0UQ2,"I don't really like to beat around the bush so I'll just get straight to the point I have had the privilage of watching the entire series already it has a solid stroy plot the action and dialog are well balanced so you don't find yourself drifting if your not too big into conversations on the other hand it takes time to develop the characters and provide a well layed out history of the past events. As others have stated there is a manga which the animae holds mostly accurate although they did change the ending probly for finacial reasons or mass custumer appeal for whatever reason It still does not dissapoint. I give it a 5/5 for story 5/5 for fight sequences 4/5 for soundtrack. I gave the product a 4/5 overall only because considering the entire series has already been made its a shame its not available as a box set. Note: The series is 26 Episodes long. Side Note: If you are a fan of the following animaes they are some of my favorites so use this as a factor to determine if this is for you: Berserk, Cowboy Bebop, and Elfen Lied. (expecially if you enjoyed Berserk)",1233792000,,1082,4.388059701492537
8294311,5,B001DN0UQ2,"""Claymore"" is one of the best anime series of 2008, if not the best.

The plot starts off simple--humans coexist with dangerous, deadly beasts known as Yoma. They are the most powerful beings on the planet, and can turn other people into Yoma. The only way in which humans have been able to defeat the Yoma is through hired help from Claymores, female exterminators who are half-human, half-Yoma.

Raki's family was killed by Yoma, but Raki is lucky to meet the Claymore who helps him, named Clare. Although she is somewhat nonchalant about Raki, she helps kill the Yoma responsible for murdering his parents. Clare leaves, but the villagers kick Raki out, in fear of being attacked by Raki. After all, Raki did make contact with the Yoma, so he could kill the other villagers.

Although Raki passes out in a sandstorm, Clare comes to rescue him. After a difficult battle with a Yoma, Raki befriends Clare. Raki then learns everything about Claymores.

Only the Claymore warrior's human side keeps them from turning into a Yoma. And Clare is very fortunate to have Raki to help her. Even though I've never seen a guy cry as much as Raki, he becomes her emotional support.

Thus, ""Claymore"" becomes a fascinating series, in which females are actually the more powerful and independent beings. Raki actually becomes the caretaker for Clare, cooking for her and making sure that she is okay. I feel weird stating this, but ""Claymore"" is really an incredible series for the new millenium, in which the male characters must actually help the powerful, dominating females. The gender roles are switched in this anime, making for a more engaging look at how the gender roles have changed in recent years.

Even though Raki cries just as much as Shinji Ikari in ""Neon Genesis Evangelion,"" he makes for an intriguing character. He cares greatly for Clare, who has to stay unemotional in her duty as a Claymore.

Clare is even more fascinating. She is the unemotional warrior who chose to take the path of a warrior, killing Yoma. Whenever her Yoma side becomes too dominating, she goes out of control, and even asks Raki to kill her when her adrenaline level reaches an uncontrollable level. Thankfully, Raki is able to embrace and give her the love she needs.

It's an incredibly earth-shattering fantasy, and a drama that reaches such an incredibly high level. It's definitely my current favorite of 2008, and it deserves a lot more attention than it's gotten so far.",1225411200,5,2460,4.826603325415677
8294312,5,B001DN0UQ2,"Claymore Is by far one of the best anime out there.  If you have read the manga you will know what to expect.  But if you haven't here is a little information about Claymore.  Claymore is a story about an organization made up of entirely female half human/half deamon claymore weilding yoma (demaon) slaying band of mercenaries.  Why there are no males will be explained later, but the jist of the story is that the claymores go and save towns and villages from ranpaging deamon onsloughts in exhange for money, but the story goes much deeper than that as the series progresses

This first DVD will introduce the main character, Clare and her first few missions with the ""organization"" and her continual conflict between doing what the organization orders her to do and her own personel goals and basicly introduces what the claymores are.  It is a great action anime and the animation is just beautiful along with the deep story line.  I highly recommend this DVD and this series",1221264000,12,980,4.729411764705882
