8175347,5,B000GTLR1Q,"This movie tells the story of Andres De Los Santos' arrest, trial and eventual escape from jail for accidentally crossing into Mexico with some hunting rifles.  It showed how flawed the Mexican judicial system is, as well as how corruption can work both for and against you when dealing with Mexican authorities.

  In many instances I thought that I was watching a documentary instead of a movie because the dialogue was so realistic.  The acting was rather amateurish, however it was so well written that that this movie easily overcame this obstacle.  Overall an excellent movie and I highly recommend it.",1279411200,,608,4.97029702970297
