I'm fluent in Spanish, but not French (at ALL) - so I thought I'd try this in Spanish first to see if it holds the kids' attention. They are all five and under (four children) and it was pretty well done, I thought - goofy graphics, and a little annoying for adults (what kids video isn't?) but the Spanish was spoken well, and had a good theme, and the kids laughed inthe right spots.

Do they actually understand what's going on, and are they grasping any language? I don't know. But I do like that they're experiencing Spanish - I think it's just a bit fast, even though they have a foundation. -

I'm holding off on getting the French one, and I'll wait another six months probably and try again, since I didn't really see any progress from any of the kids from this one.

I do, however, agree that students should experience language in many different facets - visually with flashcards, listening with CDs, short movies and such, reading, and of course speaking. This does provide a new way to learn. I think ages 6 and up will benefit most from it... we'll try again soon.

I did find that the level of dialogue was suited to my older child, the little ones were bored by the wordiness of it, but as an exposure to conversational Spanish, I highly recommend it!",1177459200,4,280,4.6

The videos are pretty good, but the rest of this package is a waste of money.  The videos are interesting, amusing, a good pace, fluent (with no english) which are all pluses.  My kids, all of them, like the videos but cannot stand the music and the booklets are useless.  I would just get the videos and use the money towards other materials that will have a better chance sticking with your kids.",1134000000,22,576,4.153153153153153
