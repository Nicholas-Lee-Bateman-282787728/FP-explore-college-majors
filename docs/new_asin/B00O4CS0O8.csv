6708712,4,B00O4CS0O8,"Joseph: Beloved Son, Rejected Slave, and Exalted Ruler begins oddly enough with Abraham, not Joseph. In it Abraham is having a prophetic dream, which speaks of the centuries of slavery that the Israelites will suffer in Egypt and their eventual exodus. It then flashes forward 170 years, and we see Joseph as a teenager being gifted his coat of many colors. Joseph goes off to find his brothers and show off his new coat. Even early on, we can see Isaac's favoritism to Joseph; Joseph's arrogance/obliviousness at being the favorite; and Reuben's instincts on trying to protect Joseph. Joseph also has his first prophetic dream about the sheaves of wheat and how his brothers' sheaves bowed before his sheaf. About thirty minutes in Joseph is sold into slavery, and his life is changed forever. In addition to showing elements of the story that we all know, i.e., Potiphar's wife and the great famine. We also see Joseph making reference to his father Isaac and the stairway to Heaven. The story ends by comparing Joseph with Moses and then to Jesus. This ending shows a covenantal history that is found throughout the Bible.

The story of Joseph are some of my favorite chapters in the Bible, so I have mixed feelings on this movie. On the one hand, the film itself is Biblically accurate. It does an amazing job, not only telling the story of Joseph, but putting it in its rightful place in the story of the Bible as a whole. On the other hand, I remember and often watch Joseph: King of Dreams from Dreamworks, so it is tough to live up to one of my favorite movies. Tastes in movies vary greatly though, so you will have to judge for yourself, but I personally recommend it for your family and religious education classes as well.",1434067200,8,1734,4.648208469055374
6708713,5,B00O4CS0O8,"I was given this to review for free.

I really enjoyed this story. I think children from 5 up will enjoy it as it tells the story of Joseph. We see how he goes from a favourite son to a slave to an important official to Pharaoh. We see how God works through Joseph. I like the way the film has been made and the animation is well done. A would recommend this for families who want to share Joseph's story.",1431734400,3,405,4.0

6708747,5,B00O4CS0O8,"This movie is fantastic. We actually like this movie BETTER than King of Dreams. The animation is not quite as flashy as what Dreamworks does, but that is just fine! The animation is quite good and focuses more on augmenting the story. This movie grippingly held the attention of 4 kids from 1.5 to 7 the entire way through, which is quite impressive. All of them said ""AGAIN!"" as the credits began rolling. We will indeed watch it again soon!

We also like that the movie is quite Biblical. Of course a lot of assumptions are made about the characters based on ""reading between the lines"" of what is actually in the scripture, but the characters are well crafted and seem to accurately convey the Biblical narrative. Our kids felt the weighty parts of the story: the evil of the brothers and Joseph's angst about whether he can trust his brothers again. It led do a great family discussion on God's sovereignty and how God uses means - even the evil actions of the brothers - to work for the good of those who love God.",1446595200,,1020,4.483870967741935

6708749,5,B00O4CS0O8,"Wonderful production! We watched this for the first time with our three year old daughter and it was well done! From the introduction, beginning with God's promises to Abraham to the end likening Joseph's story to Christ Jesus. Nothing is better than actually reading God's word yourself, but this production blessed us with a great visual interpretation.",1445558400,,355,5.245614035087719

6708751,5,B00O4CS0O8,"This was pretty good. We are studying ancient Egypt in our homeschool, as well as the patriarchs. The children are familiar with the people and the story, so this was a nice little visual to help tie things together.  We watched it on a rainy afternoon, and the kids enjoyed it. The animation was very simple, but this movie stuck to the facts and a good bit of the dialogue was directly from Scripture.",1443744000,4,403,4.445945945945946

8681962,5,B00O4CS0O8,"It's impossible to make a video representation of stories from scripture (or any other representation) without adding elements that aren't in scripture, but without having compared every verse I think this version does a very good job, and there's something it adds that I find very valuable.  The writing style used in the Biblical passage allows for some understanding of the emotional difficulty Joseph faced, but only a little.  I really liked the depiction of the end of the story, when Joseph has already gone through his great trials and succeeded through faith and dedication to God but then comes face to face with the brothers who betrayed him.  The emotional aspect feels like a worth depiction and adds meaning to Joseph's faith for me.

I like the animation.  It's different from what some people might expect, but I think it was done with care and works well.

I also like the DreamWorks version and I've owned if for quite a while, but when I saw part of this version on TV at a hotel once, I knew I wanted to buy it also.",1519862400,,1037,4.608695652173913

8681964,1,B00O4CS0O8,"I was caught off guard by pharaoh's wife trying to seduce Joseph.  I found the way it was presented as very troubling. I was glad that the meaning was lost on my children and they didn't realize what was happening.  I realize that the Bible is not full of G rated content, but for a movie recommended for five years old and up I was not expecting this!  The storyline simply could have said that pharoah's wife accused Joseph of a terrible sin and left it at that. We definitely would have skipped this movie for our young children had we known.  This review is the warning that I wish someone had given to me!",1503705600,,610,4.278260869565218
8681965,4,B00O4CS0O8,"This is the closest-to-the-Bible-narrative movie of Joseph I've ever seen. It's very nice. The animations are not that great, but still, it is a very worth-it-to-watch movie.",1469318400,,174,5.481481481481482
