6263901,5,B00II4DYHG,bought all the new blu- rays and no disappointments at all. it has been an incredible experience re watching the series in its highest quality to date. excited for this  release and every other one each month!!!!!!!,1398038400,4,215,4.8108108108108105
6263902,5,B00II4DYHG,"I have NOT been disappointed at all. I have not been this excited about rematching this series since I was a kid watching DBZ for the first time.

Just received my copy and it still amazes me at how good it looks. I don't mind the cropping as long as the main focus of the scene is there. The only way you will please everyone is to release a set with both versions and honestly unless you're Disney or some rich corporation, you probably won't do this because it is very expensive, so the best you can do is release the version that gets more sales. For you 4:3 people I'm sorry, but you did get your Dragon Boxes and if 16:9 really bothers you and you like the 4:3 then Blu Ray releases shouldn't really bother you. Now let us 16:9 people enjoy our widescreen and hi-def picture.",1397952000,4,781,4.241610738255034
6263903,5,B00II4DYHG,"These releases are awesome and highly recommended. Lots of blood and cussing ha, plus blu ray makes it look great. These versions are full episodes instead of Kai cutting down over 300 minutes of time. If your looking for DBZ on blu ray this is the set for you!",1396915200,12,261,4.346938775510204
6263904,5,B00II4DYHG,"I don't see what the hype is all about. I like these releases. They are amazingly clear without as much grain. Sure I would PREFER to have the non-zoomed in version.. but as a DBZ  fan , I will take what I can get. that or get the previously released DVD versions.",1395878400,8,264,4.076923076923077
6263905,5,B00II4DYHG,"True fans will enjoy the Bruce OST 2.0 audio track on this set.
Remember it's blu ray DBZ! can't get any better, better order two or three cause they are gonna be RARE!",1395273600,13,168,4.121212121212121
6263906,5,B00II4DYHG,This is by far the best dbz release of all time season 2 was amazing and I do plan on buying allot this. If your confused on either getting it or not then here a review of season 2 Blu ray I found on YouTube. This guy does a geat job explain the review and he even compare it with the orange bricks [...],1393113600,14,304,3.765625
6263907,5,B00II4DYHG,I have bought all of the Blu Rays and can't wait for this one. The new season sets Blu Rays are a must have for any DBZ fan trust me they are really good.,1392940800,19,154,3.5588235294117645
6263908,4,B00II4DYHG,"4 Stars specifically for the Amazon Instant Video Version. Needs the option between Japanese and American music. E-mailed Amazon about it a few months ago and still nothing. Disappointed, want to buy/watch the rest but not a fan of the Japanese music.",1512691200,,251,5.0
6263909,5,B00II4DYHG,This has to be the best set of Dragon Ball Z they have made to date. I'd place these over the Orange Bricks and Kai any day. Add in the option between the original Japanese music or the American versions and this is a top pick.,1512604800,,227,3.9565217391304346
6263910,5,B00II4DYHG,"A true Blu-Ray restoration. If you love DBZ and respect the original material, this offers the full package at a modest price. THIS is what you want.

DBZ KAI is the inferior recut/restoration with an offensive price tag. You want the full DBZ experience? Look no further.",1503619200,,272,4.787234042553192
6263911,5,B00II4DYHG,"This is a good buy, but not the best. I ended up returning it because the DBZ version does a MUCH better job on the last half of the episodes in this product. Those later episodes in this one are some of the best, but when you get there, know that the original DBZ version will always be unrivaled in their execution of them.",1502150400,,325,4.09375

6263934,1,B00II4DYHG,"Why?!! Its cropped!! It looks like garbage this show is not meant to be widescreen! Let me explain it to you so you can understand now imagine star trek being released on blu ray and fans complaining and  whining ""why is this fullscreen why isn't this widescreen ?"" Huh that's because when star trek was made for tv they weren't no widescreen TV's but we can make it widescreen if you want but we have to cut everyone's heads off ! is that ok with you ? And the true fans and purist would have said heck no  ! but a lot of dbz fans are ignorant unlike star trek fans and buy this garbage and that's why funimation cancelled the dbz levels blurays release cuz they were fullscreen
and the  ignorant dbz fans don't like seeing there widescreen TV's not fill the whole screen!! That's because it's not suppose !!",1469664000,,809,4.344370860927152

6263938,5,B00II4DYHG,"Everything about this release of season four on Bluray rules.  But, the copy that we received did not include the outer sleeve.  That may not be a huge deal to some, but it bummed me out a little bit.  If your a picky collector then consider the possibility of this happening to you.  Everything else is perfect, and the picture quality is unmatched! A must buy for old and new fans alike.",1467331200,2,389,4.361111111111111

Amazon Video could be the leader in streaming services, IF they embrace the underground cultures and give fans what they want.

6264013,3,B00II4DYHG,"So I just finished watching Season 4 of Dragon Ball Z and I must say, I hated how stressful it was to watch this. Very little could happen in the heroes' favor but when it did, they barely made it out safely. Things seemed so uncertain and even though I continued watching, I just wanted things to be alright and all the evil in the world could just go away for once. The peaceful planet of Earth endured many tragedies and suffering, but the heroes who remained on Earth had to fight alone without the help of their friend Goku, who was the strongest of them all. And then there was the arrival of even more evil villains and that just killed it for me. Those androids seemed to be too invincible and they were kicking everyone's arse without having to try. Even though Goku was around, he was so sick by some virus that he couldn't wake up otherwise he may have been able to save the day",1422144000,,889,4.266272189349112

6264023,5,B00II4DYHG,I love having DBZ on blu-ray. I don't regret spending the extra money to get the seasons on blu-ray. The colors are just beautiful and the picture is super clean. If you love DBZ and want it HD then the blu-ray seasons are for you. I will say that I did buy the DBZ movie collection packs on regular DVD bc I'd rather pay 50 ish on the movies that 120 ish.,1414195200,3,356,3.9583333333333335

6264048,5,B00II4DYHG,"From 6 to Midnight over this. Video and sound tracking improvements with the Blu Ray version are awesome. The Blu Ray also affords you several cool pros that you can do. First, you can select ""play all"" for episodes, which is just like your standard play all but, you can also select ""Marathon Play"", which cuts out all of the intros and end credits out and essentially makes it one large seamless movie. Second, is the audio options from the main menu. You can choose original Japanese with subtitles, English audio with Japanese music in 5.1 (careful, it only plays in 5.1, so if you don't have surround the volume fluctuates) and original US broadcast 2.0. Options are nice.",1406419200,,677,4.697478991596639

6264080,5,B00II4DYHG,"Probably one of the best anime of all time is the legendary Dragonball Z!  I grew up watching it on tv and thought just how well done the story, and animation was.  But what makes such a fantastic anime even better?  Well watching it in crystal clear HD!  I didn't think the show could get any better, but to re watch it in HD is amazing!  And Season 4 continues to impress.  From a  battle worn Freiza battling against the new Super Saiyan Trunks, to the arrival of the Androids, its like watching the tv series anew.  I highly recommend Dragonball Z Season 4 for any die hard fan, or even those who want to watching something with a lot of action, suspense, and well... more action!",1403136000,,684,4.330708661417323

I don't have any complaints about the discs. They work, they are HD, sound great and it's DBZ! If you're a fan and have been waiting for the blu-Ray, then buy these now!! I purchased the level sets thinking they were going to finish them but they didn't. They started making these, and now I purchased these seasons. I hope they don't stop making the seasons. I want them all in HD for once! Hurry up and buy!",1401321600,,561,4.352380952380952

6264085,5,B00II4DYHG,"This is the best series in DBZ the beginning of Cell.  The fact that Goku stays out the picture for so long after he is accidentally killed on Namec is really amazing to me.  He's the main character yet he is doesn't want to leave for another year to come back to the living.  That's weird! Now, I get to learn about many of the characters who have had minimal roles throughout the prior years.  Love it!",1400284800,2,404,4.207792207792208
6264086,1,B00II4DYHG,"I own the Level sets for Dragon Ball Z season 1. The visual quality is stellar, on a par with Toei's Dragon Boxes. I thought to myself, ""Boy, this is the best I think Dragonball Z could look. I can't wait to own the rest.' Imagine my chagrin when these sets were abruptly cancelled. Then months later FUNimation put out a survey, and when they asked about cropping the series, removing the film grain, altering the brightness. I thought to myself 'Surely now that people have had a taste of Dragonball Z looking the best it's ever looked they won't choose to go back to the Orange Brick days.' I was wrong.

Now, I will say FUNimation has put out far worse looking Blu-Rays. Their seemingly magical ability to alter the brightness of their source materials to just the point where all of the inherent flaws become clear as crystal is well recognized. Thankfully it's free of the banding and compression artifacts many other shows FUNi has put out suffer from (Psycho-Pass and Lain being the principal offenders, considering the prices charged for both). It also sounds great. But the audio quality isn't the issue here. It's the cropping, the complete noise reduction and the brightness. For a company that prides itself in putting out an uncut and unedited product, they sure have found a creative way to tamper with their most beloved franchise.

My advice: Don't buy these sets. Insist on better. You deserve it.",1400025600,11,1415,4.747967479674797

6264088,1,B00II4DYHG,"I've seen it on my plasma TV. These releases are horrible. The picture display of these releases looks like water colors. Too bright and vivid.
The aspect ratio changed to 16:9 is not an original cut display either. *IMPORTANT the series has not only had the aspect ratio changed, but also ""the picture has been zoomed in on""  I strongly believe the poll had very little emphasis on the modification of aspect ratio. Now that the entire series will be released in 16:9, anybody who wants a definitive edition in 4:3 will have to wait and pay out the wazoo.

* Funimation is to blame for this. They ""were"" using top-of-line technology to remaster and restore the series on the Level sets. I own them and they are absolutely superior in every way to this trash.  However, Level sets were half sagas. Understand that. So, Funimation gets the rights to release the Dragon Boxes and lo and behold a few months later they release Level 1.1, then 1.2. Bad timing on Funimation's part. What they should have done was postponed the release of the Level sets not putting them out alongside the boxes.

Then of course that official letter from Funimation canceling the Level sets because people aren't buying them for reasons stated above.

A year and a half later, Funimation has found another technological remastering and restoration company that will do the part for Dragon Ball Z. *** Only now Funimation will pay them a fraction of what they were paying the other company and in return this company will produce a degraded lower level product. And that is what is being sold to everyone in stores and online right now with these season sets.",1398038400,17,1636,4.706293706293707
