Disc 1 Martha Argerich in Verbier

This is a compilation of complete items from the 2007-2008 Verbier Festival seasons. All the items feature Martha Argerich either on her own or playing with colleagues.

The disc starts with Bach's Partita No. 2 played by Argerich in typical crisp and tightly controlled manner. Although played on a piano and not an earlier keyboard instrument, her playing style suits this music very well and is completely satisfying.

She is then joined by Steven Kovacevich for a performance of Mozart's short Andante and 5 Variations for piano duet which once again, is despatched with a crisp, rhythmical style and exuding plenty of energy.

The Grieg Cello Sonata comes next and this receives a particularly passionate performance by Mischa Maisky who is one of Argerich's very regular chamber music colleagues. The benefits of their long musical partnership is evident throughout this major, but rarely performed work, as the romantically fluctuating pulses and phrasing shared by the two is as if by one single mind. This is a very fine and involving performance indeed.

A fine performance of Bartok's Violin Sonata follows with Renaud Capucon totally on top of the considerable technical and musical demands of the piece.

The following Variations on a theme of Paganini by Lutoslawski is a staple favourite of Argerich and this the 3rd recording of her playing it. Both Argerich and Gabriela Montero throw off its pianistic challenges with apparent ease. This is a really fun piece to listen to while exploring all the possibilities of two pianos and is wonderfully inventive.

The last item on the disc is a major chamber work by Shostakovich - his Piano Quintet. For this Argerich is joined by Joshua Bell, Henning Kraggerud, Yuri Bashmet and Mischa Maiski. This starry cast produces a committed and finely involving performance of the work.

The musical credentials of this disc are high therefore. The 16:9 imaging is good with clear and detailed camera work. The sound, only available in stereo, is therefore below modern standards. The lack of surround sound options is a regular failing in recordings from the Verbier Festival and it is a matter that should be addressed and corrected.

Disc 2 Highlights in piano and chant

This disc includes Adam Laloum's debut performance at the Verbier Festival, the recital being recorded in 2010 just one year after his winning of the 2009 Clara Haskil competition.

Laloum's playing can reasonably be described as expressively lyrical and that description would fit all the music that he plays in this recital. His technique is impressively faultless and his familiarity with the keyboard enables him to concentrate on the performance with scarcely a single glance downwards at the keys or his fingers.

The main piece in his recital is Schubert's 18th Sonata, which again, is given a gently expressive reading. Between these two items are a couple of Debussy's Preludes where `General Lavine-eccentric' is given with a nice sense of quiet humour.

It is possible to imagine a more incisive or dramatically driven approach to the Schubert and, sticking with his own generation, names such as Yundi Li and Yuja Wang spring readily to mind. However, in its own gentle way, this is very fine playing indeed.

The other featured pianist is Martin Helmchen whose 2011 recital included Beethoven's 29th sonata, the Hammerklavier, as heard here. The first movement is given a fleet and fluid interpretation that avoids any suggestion of percussive emphasis. This establishes the pattern for the rest of the performance with fast and lightweight speeds contrasting with an almost muted response to the quieter passages. This is an imaginative approach which is less architectural than most and where fleetness of purpose is exchanged for structure emphasis.

The `chant' elements of this disc are represented by three songs from Schumann's Dichterliebe sung by Thomas Quasthoff in 2007, a singer who has an impressively rich and powerful voice. From 2009 are extracts from Susan Graham's recital of French songs by Bizet, Ravel and Faure. This finds the singer on good form and much appreciated by the packed audience.

The recordings offer clear and crisp imaging. The sound is presented in good quality stereo only.

Disc 3 The Verbier Festival Orchestras

Lars Vogt brings a distinctive approach to this thought provoking disc recorded in 2011 from which his performance of Mozart's 16th piano concerto with the youthful Verbier Festival Chamber Orchestra under Gabor Takacs-Nagy is taken.

Lars Vogt brings a very distinctive style to his playing on this recital which is probably indicative of his general approach to making music. In general terms he favours a slightly forward moving tempo but without any sense of hurry. His touch is lyrically gentle but firm and the whole is underpinned by a clear control of rhythmic pulse. The combined result provides an undemonstrative but intriguing and very rewarding musical experience for the listener.

Argerich is the soloist in Shostakovich's first piano concerto which, unusually, also features a solo trumpet role. Shostakovich wrote his two piano concertos with less technical demands for the pianist to make them easier to perform. This in no way diminishes their respective enjoyment for the audience and in the first concerto as performed here there is the added interest of the solo trumpet part to savour.

The two instruments maintain a dialogue throughout, the trumpet being muted in the central slow movement and then, in the last movement, introducing a melody strongly reminiscent of `When Jenny lies a-sleeping'. The whole piece finishes with a series of fanfare-like flourishes in a typical trumpet idiom. For this highly melodic and witty concerto Argerich is joined by the French trumpeter David Guerrier.

The disc is completed with a performance of Salonen's LA variations conducted by the composer. This is a modern piece clearly designed to be a stretching experience for the Los Angeles orchestra. Many listeners will also find this an equally stretching experience.

The lack of program notes is a regrettable omission, particularly in this case where the listener inevitably is left at a loss as to the exact purpose or background of the piece. It is certainly a good example of the technical prowess of the young players who are impressively efficient throughout these variations.

The whole of this disc captures the sound of the orchestra in good quality stereo and the imaging is crisp, truthful and detailed.

Disc 4 Mendelssohn in Verbier

This disc is entitled `Mendelssohn in Verbier' as it marks to bi-century of Mendelssohn's birth in 1809. However it might just as easily been entitled `Yuja Wang in Verbier' as she figures so strongly in two of the three main items and is the star of the bonus item - Stravinsky's arrangement of Petrushka movements for solo piano.

The first piece to be played is Mendelssohn's early Piano Sextet . Although carrying the late opus number of 110 it actually dates from as early as 1824 - the year before the famous and fine Octet. The Piano Sextet is certainly of the same calibre, or so it seems when played with such scintillating skill and sensitivity as by this ad hoc group of talented musicians. That Yuja Wang with her extraordinary abilities is able to fit in so seamlessly says a lot for the talents of the rest of the group.

The first Piano Concerto follows and here Yuja is the soloist bringing to the performance her customary extraordinary dexterity coupled with meltingly beautiful and sensitive phrasing plus a feather-light touch as required. The second movement amply demonstrates all these gentler elements while the outer movements sparkle in a totally winning way. Marvellous!

The 3rd Symphony concludes the concert and this is given a strongly rhythmic and muscular performance led by veteran Mendelssohnian Kurt Masur. Some listeners have found this a touch disappointing and lacking in sparkle but Mendelssohn can be more than fast and light-weight and here there is an alternative, even Teutonic, view put forward by Masur which is worth considering even though many would prefer a little more light and shade.

Light and shade is what we get in abundance with the bonus Stravinsky and which is played with jaw-dropping brilliance by Yuja Wang. She has such formidable technique at her fingertips that she is obviously enjoying it all hugely judging from the fleeting looks of pleasure flitting across her lips from time to time. This evidence of her sheer pleasure in music making is a regular feature of her performances and in this she reminds one of the violinist, Sarah Chang.
Light and shade also refers to the obvious lighting problems experienced in making this bonus recording as the main lights keep failing and we regularly fluctuate from brightly lit imaging to remarkable gloom. This has to be why this is issued as a bonus item and not as a main feature. The sound, thankfully, is not affected and such is the playing on offer that such technical matters can be put aside especially in a bonus.

This is a very fine disc indeed with the non-bonus pieces offering good visuals and DTS surround sound throughout the main program which contains at least two stand-out performances.

Disc 5 `The Magic Mountain' (2003) and `Mountain Airs.' (1995) Documentary introductions to the Verbier Festivals.

These are two informative and interesting documentaries made in 2003 and 1995 and covering the time of the creation of the Verbier Youth Orchestra. Previously the orchestral element of these concerts had been performed by the Israel Youth Orchestra.
This new orchestra was the brainchild of Martin Engstroem, Vice president of DGG, who was an essential force behind these festivals. The intention of the festivals was to create the opportunity for first class international artists to share their expertise and to be able to perform themselves without any restrictions as to content.

The orchestra was drawn from a considerable number of players who were in the transition period between music colleges and becoming musically employed. This in-between period is a very difficult time for young musicians as opportunities are decreasing as levels of expertise are rising. This orchestra was an attempt to bridge the gap and the `Magic Mountain' is a 55 minute documentary covering that story and the concluding tour.

The following 26 minute documentary, Mountain Airs,' offers a window into the village of Verbier to illustrate the range of musical and dramatic activities which form the basis of the experience. Non-musical pastime activities and social groupings are also covered.

These two films are really complementary and offer a comprehensive, enlightening and interesting glimpse into what makes Verbier special as a Festival. They deal exclusively with the events of 1995 and it would probably be interesting to find out what the situation is now with a follow-up documentary.
