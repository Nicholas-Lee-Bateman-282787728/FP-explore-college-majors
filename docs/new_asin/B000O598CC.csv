However, the tabs do not always follow the video, leaving the learner to suffer the difficult task of watching the fingering over and over to get the music right. I still highly recommend this video which appears to be originally a VHS production. Just remember, you will need to do some interpreting to play the tabs of like the teacher, John Low.

8183072,5,B000O598CC,"I had some great times with this DVD (I had it on VHS), I love all the songs John Low and his friends play and learned how to play them and sing them (without understanding anything of course).

I agree the level is not too difficult, but it may take some time to really feel the ""vibes"" of the different songs, especially blending with the melody sung. This video made a friend of mine want to learn the guitar, in a few weeks he was able to play some of those at his pace, not singing at the same time first and them playing and singing them. John Low even became an ""idol"" amongst us !

There are a few mistakes (2 or 3 max) on the tabs but he shows the right way to play the songs, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Beautiful songs (all originals from great African guitarists from the past), nice syncopated rhythms, and clear explainations, I really advice this video to anybody. Have fun !",1305849600,,893,4.2105263157894735
8183073,3,B000O598CC,"Level is not high and i was expecting much more interesting right hand ideas. It's like basic patterns with pretty easy chords .. The setting itself is ok, nice filming but nothing special.. Capo btw used a lot, and i cannot say that overall i could take many ideas from this dvd. If you expect challenging guitar music like Dgary's, not sure this is the place :-)",1213056000,5,364,4.447761194029851
