My large extended family were mostly farmers when I was born, but most had to leave their farms because they simply couldn't earn enough in today's world.  So, I had a lot of sympathy for the farmers in the movie.  I work in oil and gas and can attest to the huge amount of effort to get a well permitted these days.  The guy in the movie said it took him 2 to 3 years to permit a well, we've had wells that took 5 years to permit!

If the only way a farmer can turn a profit is by being paid off by a gas company then they should be in a different business! OR should go after all the big corporations holding these small farms down. Getting paid off is only a band-aid to their financial problems.

6338288,5,B00J8JQ7T2,"I was quite amazed by this documentary.  Fracknation is in the tradition of fearless reporting in the face of governmental and private attempts to stop producers of this movie from getting out the facts from their investigation -- about the benign and life-giving benefits of such oil/gas exploration.  Definitely speaks truth to power.
The maliciousness of the creator of Gasland (the anti-fracking film that Fracknation exposes as a fraud) has caused such harm to people and farmers across the land.  Such farmers right to have their property used for such exploration and production, and to supplement their farm income (for example), has been totally destroyed by the false claims made about fracking.  Aside from the lack of any environmental danger to fracking (itself an important fact), the documentary shows various areas where fracking is in progress and it clearly had had virtually no visual impact on the environment, contrary to claims that it would rape the land.
The makers of this documentary drew upon various respected sources of information (government labs, university scientists, etc.) who clearly show why fracking is beneficial to property owners, neighbors and consumers and better for the environment in some respects compared to traditional oil production methods.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants facts about this subject.",1424390400,2,1360,5.366197183098592
6338289,1,B00J8JQ7T2,"I live in an area where Fracking has been going on for a few years now.  I'm in the middle of the country and since Fracking has started, we have had several earthquakes.  They're becoming almost a regular occurrence.  Some people say fracking is to blame, others (probably gas companies) say fracking has nothing to do with the earthquakes.

So when I saw this, I expected it to be an examination of the practice, pros and cons.  Instead, I found a one-sided propaganda film probably funded by gas companies.

The main focus seems to be on an area in Pittsburgh where Fracking was suspended due to pollution concerns.  He interviews a lot of farmers about the problems this has caused them.  They talk about how long they've had their farms and how they might not survive without the fracking revenue.  So much time is spent on this, but it's proof of nothing.  People would probably store nuclear waste in their homes if they were given fat checks to do so.  Why is the avarice of farmers and/or their inability to run their farms without supplemental income relevant to the discussion of the safety of fracking?  The focus is shifted away from whether it is safe to an attack on those who got it suspended.

The filmmaker also shows how another anti-fracking filmmaker seems to have produced a non-factual movie on fracking.  The other filmmaker shows polluted water and tap water that lights on fire.  But shows that this was probably going on a long time before fracking came to town.  The other filmmaker does seem dodgy. And probably wrong about a lot of things too.

On the subject of fracking and earthquakes, he doesn't deny that they cause earthquakes or seismic activity.  He just finds somebody to downplay it.  It's like saying it's OK to have mice in your house because they're not rats.  The message he seems to be trying to obscure is that it does cause earthquakes.  But argues they are minor ones.  So it's all OK.

As for other forms of clean energy, all are attacked.  Solar - the very un-green manufacturing methods for solar panels.  Wind farms?  They kill birds.  Very similar to the way the Tom Hunt Energy Hall treats everything but fracking at the Perot Museum in Dallas.  And of course, Hunt Petroleum is an oil and gas company.  So this comes off as gas industry propaganda.

And who is behind trying to stop fracking?  His conclusions: the liberals and commies.  Well, OK, not commies anymore, but the Russians.

This was a totally right-wing, pro-business propaganda piece.  The government should stay out of this, Hollywood elites should stay out.  If you don't please the company, people will suffer financial losses.  All up-sides, no downsides.  This was not a balanced look at the subject.

Maybe there's a reason this guy is freelance.  Maybe the real investigative journals won't have him.  And he plies his living doing propaganda films for big business.

I'm so sorry I bought this.  I'm so sorry this stooge got any money from me for this thing.  This movie shed no light on the issues.",1422576000,11,3027,4.707456978967495
6338290,1,B00J8JQ7T2,"A sham of a ""documentary"".

Freelance ""journalist"" Phelim McAleer claims to have written for such publications as The FT and The Economist, but for the past 9 years seems to have made his living making anti-environmentalist ""documentaries"" beginning with his defense of Gabriel Resources who, in 2006, were proposing open-pit gold mining in Romania which was strongly opposed by the local population. McAleer came to the rescue of the mining company with a documentary claiming to take a balanced look at the issue. One problem - guess who paid for McAleer's film? That's right, the mining company.

That alone should give you some sense of this self-proclaimed documentarian's journalistic integrity......he has none.

Positive reviews for this title make it sound like it's a balanced reevaluation  of a misunderstood and vilified process. It's not. These reviewers giving it 5 stars and praising it's refreshing honestly clearly wouldn't know a well-balanced piece of journalism from a campaign ad for the Republican Party.

The film's problem is that it presents absolutely no positive scientific evidence to support it's constant implication that fracking is somehow an earth-friendly, non-toxic activity - quite possibly because none exists. Also, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that everyone interviewed has some sort of vested financial interest in talking-up the gas companies - yes, even the Penn State ""expert"" who makes the whole process sound so benign (three guesses as to who are some of Penn State's major financial donors). In fact, if it's facts you want (and Fracknation will leave any vaguely analytical individual craving them) then consider the FACT that in 2009, Penn State put out research that indicated taxing gas drillers in the state would drive them away, yet failed to note that the study was funded by the very industry it's report was defending (it resulted in the industry not having to pay a penny of tax in PA - how convenient). The ""study"" was also the work of an economist with a track record of manufacturing data biased in favor of whichever industry was paying him to do the research.

Long story short, if you have little or no regard for either scientific or journalistic integrity (or the planet for that matter) and just want something to make you feel good about polluting the land, the air and the water, this is the film for you. If, on the other hand, you have even an ounce of common sense, this film will leave you alarmed at it's bare-faced hypocrisy and annoyed that you wasted over an hour of your life watching it.

The gas drilling sites that I could see from the road appeared to be well organized commercial operations, which could do nothing but help the local economy and our nations energy supply.

In talking with him and knowing he is one of the most honest men I have ever met, he immediately explained and debunked so much of what Josh Fox so cunningly and falsey spewed in his documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed fracknation and just how effectively it destroyed gasland. The Josh Fox zombies who posted their unfounded negative reviews here are part of the problem of why we still get our energy from the middle east who in turn funds those groups over there who hate us so much. You can tell many of the reviewers didn't even watch fracknation. One claimed there was no science in fracknation which means that the scientific documents provided, the EPA findings, the Penn State findings in fracknation all contained no science. I feel so sorry for the environmentalist movement so blinded to reason that they will follow a phony like Josh Fox into the utter black hole of ignorance and dishonesty. I have no qualms saying fracking or any drilling for that matter is not perfect. However it is not the water polluting, humanity destroying leviathan gasland claims it to be. All the so called environmentalists want windfarms just as long as they are not in their backyard. Just look to the liberal elites who want wind farms just as long as they are not miles off of Martha's Vineyard in the ocean.

Instead its just the opposite of gas nation, its very poppy not a whole lot of facts, and relies heavily on the opinions of people who are pro fracking. Its almost comes off as a smear campaign against gas nation and its director.

Honestly I could give a care about either all I wanted an unbiased movie and this is not it. One aspect of the documentary that irritated me is that he barely addressed the chance/frequency of chemicals leaking into the ground due to fracking. Sure we're exposed to thousands of harmful chemicals in small doses every day, but if a chemical leak took place at a fracking site that would likely cause environmental issues.

A good aspect of the documentary is that he exposed the most prominent family in gas nation (the ones who light their water on fire) as slightly dubious characters. The movies worth a watch just to know that their water was tested by the EPA and found to be acceptable.

Overall its worth a watch, but its just a ying to the yang that is gas nation.",1407628800,,1179,4.578199052132701

I'm sure people who do not care about the planet will love this film. Face it, it says what you want to hear. But  I prefer scientific facts not just talking to a bunch of people who have a money motive to lie.  Think about it, there is no way you  can pump chemicals in the ground without something bad happening.  It's just not logical.  I can tell some of the people he interviews have problems with their water by the pauses in their answers.  They are making money and don't want to bite the hand that feeds them. Most of them are farmers who are not making money farming. Small farms are all being put out of business by huge industrial farms. These small farmers need money.  You really can't trust what they say. Always follow the money and take what the people who are profiting from fracking say with a grain of salt.  One note, on Showtime's Years of Living Dangerously, a scientist tracking natural gas, said it caused more greenhouse gas than other pollution sources.  They had the charts and graphs to prove it. I think we are asking the wrong questions.  Instead of asking to frack or not to frack, we should be asking why? Why aren't we using more alternative energies by now?

6338320,3,B00J8JQ7T2,"Having seen Gasland I was attracted to this film to get the complete story.  The gist of this film is that it is supposed to be completely independent and funded by private donors giving around $263K online.  The filmmaker, Phelim McAleer, uses a strategy of using credible sources and first hand interviews with people to get to the truth about fracking.  He interviews famers in Pennsylvania that want gas producers to sign leases to use their land for gas extraction.  These people claim to suffer no adverse effects from the extraction and say they depend on the income from leasing to survive.  He then talks about methane gas as well as other naturally occurring carbon based flammable gases are found underground and how the ability for water to catch on fire has been around long before fracking was started by man around 1947.  There are several attempts made by him to interview the producer of Gasland but that person does not cooperate.

So McAleer has had a slam dunk and destroyed the claims made in Gasland?  Yes and no.

I liked this film and how he did so much leg work to do the interviews and gather the reports made by governmental agencies.  However, he was weak in four vital areas.

1.  He interviews farmers who have had the farm in their family 150+ years who claim income from the land leases are required to have the farm survive.  What did these people do and how did they survive prior to when fracking really took off in the 21st century in the US?  When gas producers were not writing 6 figure checks up front the farms sustained a solvent operation for 100+ years.  Why is this not possible now?

2.  He interviews a leading PhD researcher, chemist, and professor on the subject of the chemicals in fracking fluid but they get off on a tangent about how if you use the scientific names of chemicals found in anything like broccoli you can fear monger.  The PhD cites a case where if mice are fed an excessive diet of broccoli it has ill effects on their health and can lead to death.  They never really touch on the content of the fracking fluid waste water.  If it is really not a threat to human health McAleer should have proved it and ended the debate.  Gasland claims the fluid is so toxic it is illegal to dispose of it in any municipal waste water system so giant reservoirs of waste fluid is pumped into machines that spray it as a mist into direct sunlight to evaporate the stuff into the air for disposal which is 100% legal.

3.  He makes repeated claims that Russia and Putin are behind the environmental movement in the Western world to reap profits from the sales of carbon energy.  He does not present any evidence to back this claim up but decided to interview an 85 year old woman in Europe who lives on less than $250 a month with 70% of this going to her energy bills.  There is a complete disconnect there.  Should Russia be blamed for everyone not retiring with a sound nest egg and not having to worry about money when they are old?

4.  The final minutes of the film kind of go off into a scope beyond the realm of the movie which was to prove Gasland was inaccurate.  McAleer basically says children who grow up in industrialized nations with cheap energy will live long lives and have their dreams come true while kids in developing nations will die sooner and basically fail at life.  They show footage of kids holding tablet PCs then contrast it with people in the most blighted slum of Asia bathing in a river with a corpse floating in the water.  He should have just shown a typical American grocery store and made a point about the availability of products and affordability of them when energy is cheap instead of going into a philosophical thing.  BTW, there is not a word spoken about the price levels of gas to the end user in price per cubic foot or average utility bill comparing things before fracking took off and now.  If the market is flooded with gas the prices should have dropped by a significant percentage but they have failed to do so.  Intended or not this segment looked like it was produced by the oil and gas industry.

Overall, it is a film worth watching.  Gasland 2 is already in the works and I will be watching it to see if they make any mention of this film which they probably will not do; shame on them.  McAleer should do a Fracknation 2 as well and fix the aforementioned issues with it.  If he can answer why farmers have to depend on gas leases to survive when farming sustained the farms in the old days and if he can prove processed waste water from the wells is safe then more power to him.",1406246400,26,4588,4.437275985663082
6338321,2,B00J8JQ7T2,"I just finished watching Fracknation, the documentary film by Irish director Phelim McAleer that purports to be a journalists search for the fracking truth. What a blatant piece of propaganda! Very slickly produced, the film was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which was a very clever ploy to avoid disclosing the filmmakers obvious love affair with climate change deniers and the oil and gas industry. Far from searching out the truth, this film is a one-sided (and, on the surface, convincing) attempt to debunk the anti-fracking documentary GASLAND and its sequel, Gasland 2.

It does not take long to see where this film is going, as it demonizes Josh Fox (the director of Gasland) and discredits anybody who appeared in that documentary. The film is filled with clever editing, tear-jerking scenes of farmers who claim that gas leases are the key to their survival, interviews with academic scientists who remind you of the types of so-called scientists who would deny that smoking cigarettes causes cancer, and the type of imagery that is a cross between Ronald Reagans Morning in America and the public relations films that came out of the chemical industry back in the 1950s and 1960s.

If you were to believe this film, there is not a single documented case of water contamination or seismic activity associated with fracking. Among other things, the film suggests that:
1) broccoli contains more carcinogens than fracking fluid
2) geothermal wells are the greatest cause of earthquakes
3) the manufacture of solar panels is one of the most toxic processes on the planet.

There is no mention of discharge wells and no mention of the massive volumes of water that are used (and subsequently contaminated) in the fracking process. To the contrary, the film suggests that there are only 3 days when a fracking well represents even the slightest risks, followed by 20, 30 or 40 years of clean energy production, satisfying the worlds insatiable love of energy. It even goes as far as to suggest that Vladimir Putin is orchestrating opposition to fracking in Europe and the United States because he does not want to see inexpensive natural gas production interfering with the export profits of Gazprom, the Russian gas giant.

This film is anything but a search for the truth. It is nothing more than slickly packaged bunk disguised as journalism.",1406160000,12,2359,5.025575447570333

6338325,5,B00J8JQ7T2,"I grew up in a time when true journalism was prevalent though not always the case. People held a certain amount of skepticism when listening to or reading the news. But for the most part journalist were intent of finding the truth of the matter, getting to it by any and all means. The same was true of documentary film makers. Then Watergate happened. It wasn't that Woodward and Bernstein didn't find the truth, but in becoming the center of attention in that scandal journalism went from intrepid reporters seeking the truth to journalists trying to take center stage and become celebrities instead of reporters.

The same thing happened to documentary film makers. Gone were the days of movies that ranged from interesting to completely boring and in their place were films made by people with agendas instead of those seeking the truth. Sure, the Disney nature films we grew up with had set pieces in them but there was no harm or attack being made with those films. Today's documentary's instead follow the example led by Michael Moore where no matter what the reality is you simply cut things to fit your agenda and leave the rest on the cutting room floor. If it doesn't suit your needs, then it is filed away where no one can find it. In essence, the truth is out there but hidden by the very people who claim to want to show you the truth.

That being said I didn't know what to expect when I watched FRACKNATION. I went in wondering if I was going to get yet another movie that claimed to be a documentary while doing nothing more than pushing its agenda. There is still the possibility that this is exactly what we find but with the way the story it tells unfolds, with the facts that can be found these days on the internet, I was left feeling that I was actually getting reality her, getting the truth.

Journalist Philem McAleer sets out after seeing the film GASLAND, a documentary about the dangers of fracking, to discover if what they've shown is true or not. With this country's dependency on oil it would seem that finding other ways to discover fuel sources would be a good thing. The movie GASLAND shows the damage and danger involved with fracking, highlighted by a scene in the film where a family suing over fracking shows the film makers how their tap water catches in fire when a flame is placed near it, a truly astounding sight to see. The movie takes the side of environmentalists who claim that fracking is the most evil of all things in existence.

As McAleer delves deeper into the items presented in that movie, he soon discovers that there are blatant misrepresentations and some out and out lies being told. The biggest one focuses around that ready for viewing video bite which was picked up by so many news outlets, the flaming tap water. It turns out that the tap water of numerous people in the location it was filmed with actually does, on occasion, light up when ignited. The thing is it has been doing it for years, many prior to when fracking was going on. This would mean that fracking had nothing to do with what we were witnessing even though it was being called the villain responsible for it.

McAleer goes to a Q & A session with the director and star of that documentary, Josh Fox. When he gets the chance to ask Fox questions about the validity of the facts he cites in the film, Fox attempts to turn the tables and portray McAleer as being uninformed while at the same time never answering any of the questions put to him. It displays him as being disingenuous at best and a fraud at worst. But this is merely the beginning of the film. There is much more about Mr. Fox that the film brings out as it progresses.

Taking the various items posed in the GASLAND film, McAleer goes through them one at a time and disproves them. In so doing he doesn't necessarily promote fracking, though one could see where it is not near the demon it is portrayed as by environmentalists, but he does show that with some money, a camera and a will to deceive a new generation of journalists and documentary film makers will lie and twist things to the point that what the end product becomes is not a dose of reality but pure propaganda.

The main thing that you should walk away from this film wondering isn't about fracking but about the film makers out there today. The question I was left with was why would someone who was trying to inform me, to present an actual problem to me, feel the need to manipulate the facts, to blatantly lie, to misinform, who would use any and all means necessary to alter those facts to suit their needs to convince me of their cause? If they are willing to lie and change facts then why would I believe anything they had to say? In an overzealous need to push their agenda they instead push me away and cause me to doubt what they have to say.

It goes further than just this movie and the one it focuses on. When you look online for reviews of this film you find that the ones giving it the lowest marks never discuss the facts presented by McAleer. Instead they attempt character assassination by calling him names, try to portray him as a paid employee of big oil companies and ignore the fact that their hero out and out lied about so many things. They display an attitude of the ends justify the means.

This movie, rather than portraying fracking as a cure all (even though in the end it does support it), shows the state of documentary film making and news reporting in this country. Network news programs willing to grab up any video clips that support a story they are doing without delving any deeper than the descriptions given by those who shot the story display shoddy journalism. Documentary film makers who feel it fine to lie and alter facts show that they've stepped away from making documentaries and are more concerned with self promotion and seeking adulation than in making a purely objective film.

FRACKNATION is good in so many ways. It makes its points in compelling fashion while entertaining at the same time. It does take a side of the issue but not to the point of ignoring most facts or using it as an attack piece on groups, even though it does take Mr. Fox to task for the way he does things. At the heart of it what it does is make you hunger for more information. It makes you want to find the absolute truth about the subject of fracking.

As the producer of the first climate change denial film, ""Not Evil Just Wrong"" McAleer is known to arrange his career around selling doubt.",1505174400,,607,4.527272727272727
8648731,2,B00J8JQ7T2,"The crux of the argument is that farmers who signed leases for fracking on their land have been blocked from receiving the money from the fracking due to big government. The film can't answer the question of whether or not fracking is safe because the people he spends the most time with do not have fracking on their property at the time of filming. The film also can't answer the question of whether the money from fracking should save struggling farms in the first place, it just assumes that the farmers featured should have their farms saved by money from leasing their mineral rights. In other words, the film is set up to dismiss the claims of Gasland by using evidence that is not able to refute the claims of Gasland, but tries to do so by playing on sentimentality about the American Farmer vs. the Big Scary Government Bureaucrat. The film can't answer the question of whether fracking affects larger water supplies than private property wells or larger ecosystems because it doesn't even ask the question. I'm not saying Gasland is right or better, but the two films should be watched together and it should be realized they are not addressing the same questions.

This film also allows a number of questionable statements to go unchallenged, such as one gentleman who claims that the environmental movement is being funded by Russia, while simultaneously at times relying on footage supplied by RT with their watermark clearly visible. Not challenging the dubious claim undermines the credibility of the journalist host, particularly after he challenged a regulator repeatedly about her past actions; he's clearly capable of it and so by not challenging this claim he betrays his bias. It's clear he will challenge those he wants to and allow others to make ridiculous claims that fit the point of his film. The host of the film also claims that there is no loophole in the Clean Water Act for fracking due to the 2005 energy bill, but there is because the 2005 bill exempted runoff from fracking from regulation by the Clean Water Act. That is easily verifiable. These two things are major issues from me that seriously undermine the film's attempt to explore the claims of Gasland. There are more credible sources that could refute the claims of Gasland that he could have relied on, but he wanted to make his film sensational, too.

Gasland is about water safety from fracking, this film is about whether or not the money from fracking leases can and should save farms while disregarding concerns about water safety. Both films are one-sided but aren't having the same conversation but watch them both, and then do your own research from reputable sources. And maybe rely less on sources that use Russia's influence on the Polish energy market to make their claims like this one.",1503446400,,2795,4.845188284518828

8648733,2,B00J8JQ7T2,"I watched this doc with an open mind waiting for it to get to the part where it talks about Texas and Earthquakes and what information would be presented.  I can understand the date of this doc is borderline around the time a VERY comprehensive study was completed by UT and I believe the USGS and maybe one of the Oklahoma Universities.  It was done because of the sheer number of earthquakes that have happened since fracking started in northern Texas and OK. Before the study was done there already seemed to be enough statistical data to show fracking was causing at least part of these, because the trend was, when drilling would kick in, earthquakes would become more numerous.  After the oil price collapse in 2009-2010 when drilling slowed way down, so did the earthquakes.  Also, different scientists involved in Texas and Oklahoma did NOT agree as to cause and effect, although in 2011 - 2012 there seemed to be more people who wanted to blame deep well storage of contaminated water, and not the actual drilling, or fracking.

So, the study.  The different companies involved, mainly the drillers and entities involved in deep well storage (a theory of what is causing part of the earthquakes) agreed to share data for an extended time period about all activities with the team leading the study. It was a long enough time period so that a reasonable scientist could make statistical correlations

The findings were that FRACKING in this region was statistically causing earthquakes, because the earthquakes were very aligned with when drilling was taking place (the fracking operation).  I don't remember if the study attributed anything to deep well storage.

So, back to this doc.  This doc is a big bash on Gasland, which I didn't watch, and it did so because it mislead and cherry picked data.  I don't care.  However, THIS doc cherry picked WHO it chose to talk to about the issue of earthquakes in Texas and OK because there were plenty of Geologists that openly said it was likely but they couldn't say it without a comprehensive study (different companies such as NRG have DEEP pockets to sue you out of existence, and actively pursue THAT particular tactic)

I would have to agree with another person who commented, which is, who paid for this doc?  Yes, I listened to the beginning when there was a discussion about crowd-sourcing, but because this doc seems to be very one sided, I'm thinking that was only one driplet of the funding, because this doc paints fracking as if it's the savior of the world, and that has to disregard REAL documented destructive events that have been caused by fracking.

Lastly, this doc doesn't talk about water in the way that fracking has ruined various communities, once again here in Texas.  Fracking uses HUGE amounts of water.  It's not recaptured and cleaned and returned to the environment.  It's treated as hazardous material, so all that fresh water ends up wasted to the world for basically hundreds of thousands of years as it gets buried deep in the earth.  In small town Texas, what that's caused is people's wells to run DRY, not polluted, and the communities, since they signed their water rights away, are powerless to do anything about it.  TO me, this is a case where the tax payer community member of old helped to build a town, and then a major chunk of that initial investment (creating a water resource, which happened to be critical for living), gets hijacked.  So now, the people who are left get stuck with making decisions such as ""Can we still live here having to pay for trucks to bring water in on a regular basis?""

I don't have anything against fracking, but this doc is another half-truth doc, and it's clear there are various rock formations which aren't the best for fracking because it's likely earthquakes will be generated from it, AND, until that industry wants to PAY to reclaim water, or, instead ship water from the oceans so there isn't a loss of fresh water, and they can STILL make money doing that, then I'm all for it.  Oh, the last thing that happens that hurts your tax base.  They don't fix the roads that get destroyed by all the trucking activity.  The local tax base does.  Remember that when signing one of those shiny new contracts with some company, or better yet, make a new template for local contracts, and throw away the one THEY hand you.",1500249600,,4353,4.717305151915456
