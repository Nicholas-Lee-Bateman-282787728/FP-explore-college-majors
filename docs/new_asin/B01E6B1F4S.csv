7731296,5,B01E6B1F4S,"While I do not subscribe to her Left-Leaning, Question Authority Political Views, one cannot deny her talent to sing a lyric.  Saw this program on PBS, and bought it on Amazon for far less than the PBS asking/donation price.  Politics aside, Baez can still entertain.",1468022400,4,267,4.911111111111111

7731299,5,B01E6B1F4S,"Great PBS event with Joan performing with many music legends. Great to see and hear the high quality of voices from all those folks with gray hair! The energy and synergy on stage was amazing and gratifying. In my opinion, not one weak song. And no one tried to upstage anyone else. So great to have all these folks singing at one moment in time.",1467158400,8,346,4.338461538461538

7731302,5,B01E6B1F4S,"Just watched the concert on PBS and it was wonderful so I ordered the DVD and CD. Thanks so much Joan and PBS. I was lucky enough to see Joan Baez twice in concert and both times she was excellent. Her voice remains one of the favorites to my ears and in my heart. These songs are so appropriate today with all the struggles going on in the world. A lot of who I am today was shaped by Joan Baez. She was a teacher and exemplar for this ""little hick"" from Alabama and I am so very thankful. Blessings",1465689600,13,500,4.01
7731303,5,B01E6B1F4S,"Only raves!  I've loved this lady and her art for as long as I can remember.  After all these years she's still the best.  The audio/video is excellent, better than on the PBS-TV broadcast.  I've read comments that the video is disappointing and all I can say is that mine is just fine.",1465603200,24,286,4.339622641509434

7731317,5,B01E6B1F4S,"Joan Baez is a legend.  It was her version of the song called ""All My Trials"" which played a key role in making my decision not to join the military and avoid the draft in the sixties. Thank you Joan. That song is not in this collection. But this album features some of my favorite artists such as Mavis Staples, Emmylou Harris, Judy Collins and Paul Simon. The CD is excellent, but the DVD is beautiful.  I played it again a number of times and enjoyed it thoroughly.",1476662400,3,468,4.306818181818182

7731325,5,B01E6B1F4S,"If it's Baez, I probably have it....college in the 60's I got hooked on her music....smile.  Sadly....few videos out there  as they didn't have much video then.  It's GREAT to see she still has the same style and grace she did then.  Do voices change...of course....but not souls.  I thought it was noteworthy that she recognized there are some notes she can't hit anymore (Who could?!) at 75....grin......and didn't try them.  Trust me....she still has ""what it takes"".  Well worth buying!",1473120000,4,490,4.9753086419753085

However, I have been a fan of Joan Baez since college so when I saw this concert had been released, I knew I had to have it. It's terrific.
