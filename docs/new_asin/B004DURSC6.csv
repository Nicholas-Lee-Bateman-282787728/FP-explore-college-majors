8426192,5,B004DURSC6,Each of these three documentaries was well made and the three shows together illustrate the full scope of our planet's history and our place in that history as a species. The above descriptions can tell you the rest. I'm glad to see this material put together in an economic package. I already own each of them separately already. These shows are also excellent classroom materials.,1318982400,,382,4.892307692307693
8426193,3,B004DURSC6,"The Past, Present, and Future of Earth, a History Channel collection
3 DVD Discs, being released on March 29, 2011

""Our Planet"" is a three disc set consisting of three different collections of the History channel's most Earth-centric specials: ""How the Earth was Made"", ""A Global Warning?"" and ""Life After People"" (my personal favorite) to journey through the past, present, and future of Earth.

""How the Earth Was Made"" is a 90 minute special that explores how our understanding of the Earth's age went from being based on scripture to reading rocks. These rocks told a tumultuous story of creation beginning in a land of fire with collisions of meteors to its transformation into a water world, the volcanos that formed land, the movement of the tectonic plates, the ice age, and now this warm period that has allowed civilization to bloom in the last ten thousand years. Scientists predict whether or not global warming has a hand in it, our planet will go into another ice age in fifteen thousand years, the tectonic plates will move all the continents together once more and then stop all movement making planet Earth much like Mars.

""A Global Warning?"" takes us through the events of the last Ice Age and what potentially would happen in the next Ice Age and if and how we would potentially survive. This documentary investigates extinction events of the past and use them to give clues to the future in times of ice and volcanoes preserving evidence for scientists to research in terms of water levels and carbon dioxide releases.

""Life After People"" appears to be THE original special on the subject. I've watched two seasons of the series ""Life After People"" from the History Channel. They obviously decided there were way too many factors that could be weighed in on of different aspects of civilization being brought to an abrupt halt. The special and series are equally dramatically narrated as if inanimate objects could be personified with emotions like a bridge being upset or defeated by falling over. The premise is what would happen to the Earth and things built by man if people disappeared one day. It makes no attempt to explain how people disappeared so let's just assume they were all beamed up by a spaceship one day because that's as likely as any other scenario where everyone leaves at the same time.
Being the initial special on the subject, they cover the basics of the loss of power, Hoover dam being operational for a while until circumstances cause it to fail, dogs needing to escape from homes to survive but falling into a big dog, little dog hierarchy, etc. Then to prove they aren't just making things up for kicks, they jump into the ""How do we know? Because it ALREADY HAPPENED in THIS location"" and then you get to learn the history of an abandoned city somewhere. Interesting, addictive, way overly dramatic, the best part of this set for me. How long will it take your house to fall down and what would it look like? How about a bridge? The Eiffel Tower is NOT invincible and goes crashing down! BAM! etc. etc. etc. If you like movies where destruction takes place, this is for you. One old guy they interview thinks hawks flying around abandoned building would be ""just lovely."" It ends with, ""There was life BEFORE people, there will be life AFTER people."" Just wow.
Bonus Features:
All three discs have additional scenes or footage for their respective programs. On the first disc, there is an additional documentary, ""Inside the Volcano"" that details all the elements of a volcano, how they work, the names of all the parts, different types of volcanoes, and tons of footage of different famous volcanoes (Thera, Mount Vesuvius, Tambora, Krakatoa, Mount St. Helen, and more).",1301443200,6,3724,4.8140625
