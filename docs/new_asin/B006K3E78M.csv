5000440,5,B006K3E78M,"'Let he with wisdom calculate the number.....'
This film only confirms what I've felt for decades.  A must see.  I truly believe that the Governments of the world know about this, yet will do everything to divert imminent panic.",1341100800,,228,4.82051282051282
5000441,5,B006K3E78M,"I'd always heard of people that claimed to have implants from some supposed abduction, but the operation and evidence (from a doctor who also thought these claims were foolish) freaked me out... no worries, I'm OK now. The singularity viewpoint regarding the shroud of Turin makes absolute sense. Every bit of this video was captivating. I would like to view the previous videos, but am concerned that Watchers 3 builds off Watchers 1 and 2. It would be appreciated if anyone can confirm, or refute my assumption. Don't be afraid, and don't be ignorant of the signs, but make certain you're ready. (Matthew 25:1-13) No one is going to have time to expain it to you at the last minute",1338249600,4,683,4.7
5000442,5,B006K3E78M,"In the Bible in the Gospel of Matthew chapter 24 the apostles ask Jesus what will be the signs of his return and Jesus tells them they cannot know the day or the hour of his return, but they can know the season (meaning the general time) and he lays out a set of specific signs (Signs n the Sun and Moon, and Space, Earthquakes in diverse places, Wars and Rumors of War, frightening things coming down from Heaven, Israel being reestablished as a nation, etc.,). What L.A. Marzulli does in this series is examine these songs and sees of they are happening now. The Watchers 3 is the 3rd DVD in the Watchers Series, and it is excellent. Author and television personality L. A. Marzulli looks into the the Shroud of Turin; alien implants and their surgical removal; The Torah Codes (Bible codes ELS); the strange sounds emanating in the heavens and the earth that seem to be taking place all over the earth; The Two suns Phenomena (also close objects crossing close to the sun; And update on changes in the Moon (an update from a mind blowing segment on The Watchers 2); UFO activity and the Hopi prophecies. L.A. does on site interviews with some of the world's leading experts in their respective fields of study are very convincing and It would behoove everyone to get these DVD (really get all three in the series) and make up your own mind about the evidences. After you view the evidence in this series I believe you will come to the conclusion that we are getting very close to the return of Christ.",1324425600,24,1504,4.492700729927007
5000443,5,B006K3E78M,great product,1404691200,,13,6.0
5000444,4,B006K3E78M,Very good documentary. Shocking information but very educational.,1404518400,,65,7.25
5000445,5,B006K3E78M,I enjoy each Watchers film. They're all different but connected. I don't know why people complain that they felt they were left hanging or they felt it was incomplete. It's a known fact that the Watchers series is a continuing project! L.A. has said there will be more films. I think there has been at least four more Watchers films since Watchers 3. Be patient people.,1394150400,,369,4.606060606060606
5000446,5,B006K3E78M,I've got the whole watchers series. Just needed this one. These videos are fast paced. They keep your attention and make you think. Very well done. LA Marzulli is a great researcher.,1390003200,,182,4.71875
5000447,5,B006K3E78M,Great Video.  Enjoyed it.  Getting better as series progresses.  Well worth renting.  I'm enjoying Amazon's rent feature.  Very informative series.,1389657600,,147,6.15
5000448,5,B006K3E78M,Mr. Marzulli and his partner Richard Shaw presented this information in a very compelling way and backed up his views with ancient prophetic texts. All this was packaged in a video with obvious high production values. I would recommend this video to anyone out there looking for answers to some of this world's enduring mysteries.,1386547200,,330,5.0181818181818185
5000449,5,B006K3E78M,L.A. Marzulli is what you see is what you get. We enjoy him each time we see him. He has added on to the information in number three.,1386115200,,133,3.7857142857142856
5000450,4,B006K3E78M,It has some interesting information but some of the cinema-photography is a bit gimmicky which takes away from the credibility of the film.,1385424000,,139,5.086956521739131
5000451,4,B006K3E78M,This is a better watcher movie than the books I read about them... there is more information and detail about them.  Ezekeil is the Bible book that reveals their existence and from there is the video making sense.,1385251200,,213,4.605263157894737
5000452,3,B006K3E78M,"I enjoy watching these types of movie, only for entertaining purposes though.  Some of the stuff they be talking about in these types of films is hard for me to believe. I'm not into all of conspiracy theory, ghost, gobbling and UFO's. I just watch them kill time.",1380067200,,264,4.5
5000453,3,B006K3E78M,.I hate these long reviewes  just get to the point did it get there and was it as shown works great and ad shown,1379980800,,112,3.6666666666666665
5000454,4,B006K3E78M,"Good video, if you are not familiar with L.A.M. He presents information clearly and directly, with little embellishments. This is an excellent quality, much prefered to the history channels method of theatrical entertainment with little to zero content. This movie is clearly meant to be informative, not entertainment. Well done, L.A. and team.",1379116800,,345,5.528301886792453
5000455,2,B006K3E78M,"Although my wife liked it and purchased all of the Watchers movies, I didn't appreciate the style in which it was produced and would not recommend it.  I watched the first movie but not the rest of them because I felt they were a waste of time.  I didn't learn anything from these videos and it seems like the research was not done and incorrect conclusions were drawn at time.",1378944000,,377,4.371428571428571
5000456,3,B006K3E78M,"Had several problems with this episode.  For instance, the ""implants"" could not be cut except by using a laser. But in previous episodes, the Dr said some of them broke during removal.  So is he saying they could break during delicate surgery but that the broken pieces couldn't be cut? Doesn't make sense. Also, since this was filmed, a fellow who had no stake in the game showed how he could easily duplicate the shroud of Turin, making a lifesize figurine, heating it, applying blood,etc, in the right places, then quickly wrapping in linen.",1375574400,,544,4.776595744680851
5000457,4,B006K3E78M,"If all of the information in this video is correct, it is amazing that so much stuff is being kept from the people. Why?",1375315200,,120,4.041666666666667
5000458,4,B006K3E78M,"The Watchers series researches things happening from a biblical, spiritual perspective...and continues to reveal very interesting facts that have strong biblical implications.",1375228800,,175,7.0
5000459,5,B006K3E78M,"I really like L.A. Marzulli's DVDs.  They are very, very informative.  I watched this video under the streaming videos section.",1373241600,,127,5.3
5000460,2,B006K3E78M,Fairly descent documentory to watch. Would recommend watching the previous ones first. Always interesting to watch this type of program.,1372550400,,136,5.85
5000461,5,B006K3E78M,"The entire set of DVD's should be seen by anyone who wants to educate themselves on what is happening that is being suppressed or covered up.  The Bible is full of facts, proven facts.  We, as people, are extremely ignorant of the universe and what is all in it.  I'm so glad I discovered Mr. Marzulli; I've read his book on Politics and Prophecy and I highly recommend it.",1372464000,,373,4.3768115942028984
5000462,5,B006K3E78M,Enjoyed the movies very much. I will recommend it to every one. The acting and direction was great... Very informative.,1370390400,,119,5.0
5000463,3,B006K3E78M,This video has a strong religious slant that reduces its credibility. It is worth watching once for some interesting ideas and insights but it's objectivity has been compromised by its speakers and their motives for offering their insights.,1369785600,,240,5.342105263157895
5000464,5,B006K3E78M,"We have had several dreams that have led us to research what LA calls the Nephilim. These movies answer many questions. We all have to know for ourselves, having the information available to make decisions regarding both the present and future choices we make in our lives is so important.",1369699200,6,289,4.8
5000465,5,B006K3E78M,A very revealing insight into the nature of ufos and alien abductions among other things.  It was interesting and intriguing.,1368835200,5,125,5.25
5000466,5,B006K3E78M,L A Marzulli is doing a great job with these videos & I appreciate that Amazon offers them to be viewed on line,1368489600,6,111,3.869565217391304
5000467,5,B006K3E78M,"A different perspective about end time prophesy, very educational and easy to follow, the presenter appeared to be very knowledgeable about the various themes and concept taught. I would certainly recommend it to others.",1367020800,3,220,5.5

5000469,3,B006K3E78M,"It has some good information, and some wasted time building up the idea. But most of all there is some overwhelming junk music and noise that makes some parts very hard to hear. I cannot rate it any higher I wish it was better.",1365379200,,227,4.181818181818182
5000470,5,B006K3E78M,"Had always wanted to see the Watchers series and was very pleased to learn I could watch all four in the series here on Amazon!
I was very impressed with the quality of the production and the tremendous amount of research done to produce this series. L.A. Marzulli and his team has presented some very interesting information concerning many different issues that seem to be plaguing humanity on a global scale.",1363478400,4,411,4.802816901408451
5000471,2,B006K3E78M,I didn't view this video. I thought this was a video revealing biblical prophesy. Don't believe in aliens visiting the earth..,1362355200,,126,5.0476190476190474
5000472,4,B006K3E78M,"Entertaining and worth a watch at 1.99 a download, wouldn't buy it though. Quality filming and editing, no complaints, good.",1356998400,,124,5.25
5000473,5,B006K3E78M,This documentary was very good and enlightening.  Watched in twice and especially love the part about the Shroud of Turin.,1356652800,3,122,5.1
5000474,4,B006K3E78M,Excellent video.  I enjoyed this video and would recommend it.  You need to watch all of the sets to understand what's going on and what the government is doing and/or trying to do.,1353024000,,181,4.454545454545454
5000475,5,B006K3E78M,"Well researched and presented. It takes faith to accept some of the material that may or may not be factual, but worth watching. It will open your mind to other possibilities not even hinted at by mass media.",1349136000,,208,4.5
5000476,5,B006K3E78M,"watchers 4 gives up to date information of what is going on, why it's going on.
earth changes that are happening all over the world. Howard  Storm gives an account of his near death expierence,
what happens when we die if we don't believe in God, and how loving and caring our Almight GOD is.",1348272000,,292,4.3090909090909095
5000477,5,B006K3E78M,"More detailed and continuing developments of material presented in Watchers 1 & 2.  Well researched, documented, and executed presentation.  I appreciate the delivery of such content.  May God Bless these men for their work in bringing explanations of the phenomenon we experience in our world today and the likely scientific, spiritual, biblical, and physical causes behind the phenomenon.  Thank You!",1348185600,3,402,5.65
5000478,4,B006K3E78M,"I tried to download this from Amazon and could not do it.  I was told I needed to upgrade my connection speed with my provider, which I did and still could not download it.  Amazon did refund my purchase price.  I did view the product from a different source and really liked it.",1345852800,,279,4.226415094339623
5000479,5,B006K3E78M,"Hooray for LA Marzulli! He's asking the questions that people don't even know to ask, providing answers and information not to be found on normal network media; all while linking it to biblical prophecy. An excellent and informative documentary, especially for those interested in prophecy. From earth changes to lunar and cosmic anomalies, to those weird noises, to present world violence, to Hopi prophecy and alien implants, to even the shroud of Turin; yep, it's a fascinating romp and look at the signs of the times in which we live. Can't wait to see the next one!",1342828800,,570,4.88659793814433
5000480,3,B006K3E78M,"While I found Watchers 3 to be intriguing, it also seemed sort of incomplete in that it raised more questions than it answered and it did not appear to identify the scriptures it claimed were being fulfilled to the events that it shows are happening today. I wanted to know exactly which scriptures Dr. Marzulli believes are being fulfilled the sightings of UFOs, UFO like objects and Alien activities taking place. What does it all mean? Where is it going? You're left hanging! Bottom line, it is worth renting and I enjoyed it. But I would have been sorely disappointed had I bought it!",1342828800,4,588,4.663461538461538
5000481,1,B006K3E78M,So I thought I would give it a shot and three minutes into the documentary they show an obviously doctored picture of two suns and then they head off to visit a solar expert who says they have only seen this twice in human history the first being Noah's flood and the second being the Exodus.  And she's a scientist?  Riiight!  So much for this.  You have to already be pretty caught up in the bible myth to accept any of the 'findings' in this pseudo-docuemtnary.,1341619200,10,464,4.3604651162790695
5000482,5,B006K3E78M,"Very compelling work of LA Marzulli and Richard Shaw. Not only do these phenomena appear to be undeniably real, they're independently confirmed by Biblical and prophetic sources. Many accolades to them for their courage ""To boldly go where no man has ever gone!""",1341532800,,262,5.116279069767442

As well as digging into,(no pun) fallen angels and nephilim, ancient men of renown. And all the connections. Would give higher ratings but production values not that good and I think on the first few volumes they were learning what comes across a little trial and error.",1407888000,,365,5.203389830508475
