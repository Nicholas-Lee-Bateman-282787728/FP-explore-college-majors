7374377,4,B013WQZVTS,"I think Steel Wheels is probably The Stones strongest post Some Girls album to date, & an interesting choice for the next instalment of the excellent From the Vault series (although even the most loyal stones fan must admit that they were pretty much a greatest hits band by this point in their career, even though you do get six songs from Steel Wheel.
A live album from this tour (Flashpoint) was released at the start of the 90's with half a dozen less songs, but did include Factory Girl, but there are overdubs on that album.

Cons:
For the first half of the album, there are some noticeable cuts between the songs, which could have been smoothed out.
By the start of the 90s the recording technology had advanced considerable since the last time the band toured, but I always feel that you lose a bit of that rawness, especially the acoustic guitars that some awfully tinny.

Pros:
The energy levels are incredible, with the band performing a 20+ song set.
Highlights include a incendiary performance of Midnight Rambler, & a well crafted version of 2000 light years (Satanic Majesties.. is such an underrated album).

So, not as strong as previous concerts in this series but still a real mater class in how to put on a flawless show.",1446249600,11,1241,4.631818181818182
7374378,5,B013WQZVTS,"Holy Crap! Fantastic show of ""The Greatest Rock 'n Roll Band in the World"". Not always a big fan of the late 80's Stones, but after watching this Blu-ray I was very impressed. The Blu-ray picture is great (I know it is standard def blu, but still better than DVD any day). I for one hope the Rolling Stones continue to release shows from the vault (especially the 1972 tour of America), I own all of them so far. Keep up the good work Bob Clearmountain!",1446163200,5,453,4.27906976744186
7374379,4,B013WQZVTS,"I have the audio that was released on Google Play in 2012 (plus I've had it on bootleg for years) and this is a very good show and performance from the Stones. The Steel Wheels tour was the last one with Bill Wyman in the band. What I love about the Steel Wheels shows is the portion beginning with Paint It Black followed by 2000 Light Years From Home (only tour this song was ever performed regularly) segueing into Sympathy For The Devil then followed with Gimme Shelter. In my book that is the most powerful sequence of songs in a set list ever in the history of Stones' performances, and the centerpiece for the concert that I saw in Indianapolis in 1989. Some may complain that we already have Flashpoint (which is a poor representation of this tour IMHO), but this is much better.",1445385600,11,787,4.43448275862069
7374380,1,B013WQZVTS,Most stones fanatics have a soundboard recording of the show.not sure if I will buy. Mick always said they wouldn't release stuff in the archive until they were ending it. Does this mean the end?,1444262400,,195,4.6
7374381,3,B013WQZVTS,want to hear it now???  it on FLASHPOINT....just blah,1443225600,2,53,4.888888888888889
7374382,5,B013WQZVTS,"After a long feud that lasted 7 years The Rolling Stones finally returned to touring in 1989 (last tour was 1981-82). Mick & Keith resolved their feud over who said what and the Stones came back renewed, expanded and orchestrated...ladies and gentlemen...the Steel Wheels Tour!! This show is from 02/26/1990 in Japan's Tokyo Dome. I have had VHS copies of this show almost since the day it aired. The picture was outstanding even on VHS so I am sure it will be outstanding on this release. The set list (like all shows from many of their 80's and 90's tours) was pretty much the same each night..which, for some, is another story entirely. The tour featured a goodly number of songs from their new release ""Steel Wheels"". Some songs from the lp that were not initially played in rotation showed up late in the American Tour are featured here. Among them are ""Almost Hear You Sigh"" which is beautifully done and Keith plays he new song ""Can't Be Seen With You"". I can't say this was the best show of the SW tour but it certainly is far from poor as the Stones manage to deliver some great music every time they hit the stage. I plan to pre-order this and I will fully expect to love the upgrade to Blu-Ray...especially for the improved sound track that (I hope) is as dynamic as I remember it being on the VHS tapes. If you are a fan of the later day RS tours or just want to see what the Steel Wheels tour looked and sounded like then this upcoming release should be a pleaser.",1442793600,28,1477,4.394160583941606

7374384,1,B013WQZVTS,"Another idiotic production of the RS on video! Who is the moron who produces these videos? Their music is OK, and when doing their best songs pretty good, but Wood is hardly shown, the horns are shown less, they turn away when Richards is doing his best solo work, and always show Jagger too much. Next time they do a video they should hire Monkey Man and it will do a better job.",1468454400,,380,4.219178082191781

7374390,3,B013WQZVTS,"This Steel-Wheels tour is not as good as the London show ""I-Max"" release on blue-ray, but there are many more songs. The boys were starting to show the hardness of 25 yrs of touring. The sound mixing was a great issue for this ""major"" stone's fan. Everyone was in great stage performance mode, Mick and Charlie were tight, Ron was....Ron (still a master of slide and steel guitar), Bill was his usual complacent spot on the stage....but Keith?....Keith was spot on but couldn't ""hear"" his lead guitar at all!.  You could tell he was hitting everything, but so far under mixed it was really bothersome...on all of his guitars as he changed them out they were all overwhelmed by keyboards horns and vocals on most tracks. The music set list was really-really good. All the inflatables worked, pyro-techniques worked great, back ups were flawless, but Keith???what a missed opportunity.",1458518400,5,883,4.926174496644295

7374392,3,B013WQZVTS,"I'm glade I kept my bootleg version of this show. This new re-mastered version has a very clean picture and color and  great sound, my boot has awesome sound with detailed bass, and the reason I prefer my old copy is because it includes Bill Wyman wear as the new release he is completely taken out except for a couple of flash-byes. This was his last tour with the band and he should have been just as much a part of the new version not to mention his bass playing is great in this show, (not that you could tell by watching this) They seemed to have even toned down the bass on this new version. It's still a good show, just could have been a lot better. I guess the Glimmer Twins don't want to share any royalties.",1455926400,2,717,4.158273381294964

7374396,5,B013WQZVTS,"Great sound in Japan. You can crank this baby with no distortion. Classic performance from a great band. Not a critic but a fan well pleased with this purchase. So tired of people who want to nitpick camera angles, lighting and the like. Or those who want to show their vast knowledge as Stones historians and compare each release to every other concert DVD they ever made.  For me its about the sound if you have a decent system the Rolling Stones are right there doing what they do best ....  It's only Rock and Roll and I like it!!!",1453161600,7,535,4.34
7374397,5,B013WQZVTS,"I hadn't ever been too excited about getting anything from the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle tour based on how lackluster Flashpoint was.  I was completely wrong.  Of the From the Vault releases, only the Marquee Club is better than this album.  It's a phenomenal live album, and features a decent amount of songs never featured on other live albums (or very rarely).  I own about 18 live Stones albums, and this is definitely in the top tier.

The sequence of Paint it Black into 2,000 Light Years from home into Sympathy for the Devil is one of the best of not just the Stones' live discography, but of any live album I've heard.  The intro to Continental Drift leading into Start Me Up is awesome, and the songs off Steel Wheels are universally better than the studio versions.  It made me appreciate the Steel Wheels songs more than I previously did.  The version of Midnight Rambler on here is great as well, and it's one of the better live versions of Satisfaction I've heard.  This is definitely an album worth checking out.",1452988800,20,1027,4.629834254143646

7374400,4,B013WQZVTS,"Yet another release in the ""Vault"" series from the Stones and this one does not disappoint. This very show has been talked about and reviewed with passion over the years in the bootleg realm so I was very interested to finally see the video of the show. IMO the 1989/90 tour was the last great one for the Stones and all others since then have slowly lost some intensity.

The video is not shot in widescreen and obviously not HD. But that's ok as the quality is certainly perfect for its day. However, it does suffer from the more modern but annoying rapid-fire camera edit. I think this 3-5 second camera angle edit ruins most concert videos nowadays. Also, the stage lighting is too red at times and a little hard on the eyes. And I wish these ""Vault"" series would include a few DVD extras.

The sound is great on both the DVD and CD and the song selection that night was perfect. Even most of the ""war horses"" are performed with renewed energy. Some highlights include ""Miss You,"" ""Honky Tonk Women"" (even Charlie's smiling at the end), and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" (nice extended solo by Keith). Some other things to watch/listen for are the shots of Keith during ""Ruby Tuesday"" (he's very cool looking) and also the way he introduces ""Happy"" just before he launches into it - ""Here's one. You must know it by now - let's hope I do."" This is funny because he routinely screws up the lyrics on this song and, alas, does so here as well despite the tele-prompter. His version of ""Can't be Seen"" is played/sung with passion and should be noted too. And check out the ""Glamourtwins"" Cindy and Lisa on backup vocals - Ooh La La! Mick (great vocals all night), Ronnie ""B Goode"", and Bill are all perfect and together make the show one of their best.

The packaging is nice on the set but could be better. Make sure to read the memorabilia photo of the band/crew warning. It goes on about certain ""substances"" that are not tolerated in Japan. Funny! A 4lp version of this packaged is rumored to follow soon and that should be nice.

So...my review of this release gets 4 stars. I highly recommended it to all those interested in the ""Vault"" series as it's just as good as the others put out so far. And more on the way!!!???",1449187200,3,2222,4.452088452088452

7374402,3,B013WQZVTS,"The packaging for these ""From the Vault"" releases continues to perplex me.  Why are the blu ray releases not made available in blu ray packaging? Despite the fact that the picture shows a blu ray box, this release comes in crappy cardboard CD packaging.  I can't imagine that I'll ever listen to the CDs when I have the blu ray to watch, so I'd much rather just buy the video.

As to the content, the show is a good example of the Steel Wheels shows.  The Japanese audience is somewhat subdued by Western standards, and that does affect the performances a bit, but the Stones are in good form here.  The SD BR has mediocre video but that's expected given the source material.

All in all, I'm happy to have this set.  I just feel a little ripped off by the forced inclusion of the CDs and the crappy CD packaging that's different than what's pictured.",1448928000,,851,4.416666666666667
7374403,5,B013WQZVTS,"If you are a Stones fan (I've been one since '68), buy this Blu-ray. The biggest surprise is how well the video is shot. No stupid continuous jump cuts, no plethora of tight shots, nice intuition on showing band members. Ranks with ""Live in Texas"" and ""Four Flicks - Arena Show"" as the best Stones videos (of course, the best Stones movie will always be ""Shine A Light""). VERY enjoyable.",1447977600,3,387,4.542857142857143
7374404,5,B013WQZVTS,"1990 Live from the Tokyo Dome is an amazing DVD concert video from the greatest rock and roll band of all time!
Back in the day....circa 1989 when I saw the Stones on FOX tv for their special I thought then ""wow these guys can really PLAY!"". After seeing their very loose 1981 tour, I was very surprised to see the boys with a full band and sound!
The 1990 Movie Live at the max was a very good DVD but so edited down, so was the CD ""Flashpoint"" but this DVD....this DVD fully delivers!
The show is excellent, the band is very tight, the sound mix is stunning! The filming of the show is excellent too, not this ADD style crap we find in today's videos where they cut away every 3 secs, this film lets your eyes ""breath"" and take in the show! Its just over 2 hours in length and near the end Mick starts to sing sloppy but he had to be exhausted! Great show, great DVD, great band! I have many Stones DVD's and live albums and this show for me anyways, ranks up as one of the finest moments!",1447200000,11,991,4.087179487179487
