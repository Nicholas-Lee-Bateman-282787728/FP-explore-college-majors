The songs was magnificent especially Do you remember love? & Angel's Paint. Beautiful! The problem is the dvd released by FX Media could be bootleg. The picture quality seem a little bit blemished and grainy. No digital clean up has been done here. The subtitle was bad but readable. No chapter selections! No extra feature! Sad! No region 1 dvd will be released for this one. I have been waiting for so long to see this to be release in region 1. Animeigo has annouced before to release this in region 1 but until now there is no further news. Hopefully there will be a proper release by any company who obtained the licence whether in region 1 dvd or blu-ray, I believe millions of fan would be glad to hear it!",1197590400,2,852,4.467948717948718
