8660268,5,B00KNAX8HE,This is a great at home workout with heavy weights. I love lifting heavy weights and I highly recommend any of Kelly Coffey-Meyer's dvds. I love that you can choose your workout on the menu. I usually do a combination workout to save time.,1413936000,,239,4.454545454545454
8660269,4,B00KNAX8HE,"This is a great video to help you build muscle. It focuses on heavier weight with fewer reps. Because of this any one thinking of using this video should use at least weight 3 lbs. heavier than what you normally use in other videos. This is not meant for beginners or those recovering from injury. This video assumes that you already have some experience with strength training. If you are an absolute beginner and normally use only 2-3 lbs. weights you should probably build up a little more strength before trying this video. This video is about challenging yourself physically and pushing your limits. Those with weak knees, a bad back, or any other type of physical problem should proceed with caution. I have weak knees and a weak back, because of this workout 2 in this dvd is nearly impossible for me. It focuses a lot on the legs and requires a certain level of knee durability that I do not have. Workout 2 also features dead lifts, which again I can not do because of the strain it puts on my back. It's a great DVD, but really should be approached with caution and with some experience of strength training under your belt.",1409356800,4,1134,4.536585365853658
