8253039,4,B0013UQUVY,"Good movies in the Harlequin style. All three movies are mystery romances with good endings. A Change of Place, The Waiting Game, and Diamond Girl have all been played on the Hallmark Channel and are good for family entertainment. Great watch on a cold rainy or snowy day. Buying them in the set is a really good buy. Buy all four volumes and you will have them all.",1217289600,5,366,4.397058823529412
