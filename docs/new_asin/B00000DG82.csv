7905921,4,B00000DG82,"This is a great video for anyone who is interested in learning more about or driving the Alaska highway.  The video starts with the history of the Alaska Highway it shows some nice WWII era footage of highway construction.  All the large towns that you'll cross between Dawson Creek, BC and  Fairbanks, Alaska are reviewed.  The video also contains some other footage  of ""side trips"" that can be taken off the main highway which I  found very imformative. The video of the scenery cannot be beat.  I am even  more excited about taking my own trip on the Alaska Highway after viewing  the video!",949881600,17,595,4.644230769230769
