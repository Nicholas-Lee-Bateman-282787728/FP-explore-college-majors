There are many positives about this movie which far outweighs negatives if any. The movie has got strong characters. The hero is a hero in true sense: He has character (going to the girl's college and bringing her home as his life partner without wasting any time), fearlessness (choosing revenge as his personal duty), belief (declaring and deciding to kill enemies one by one instead of all at once) to name a few.

For those who opine that the movie is too violent: After watching the movie, I've done my research on the central characters in real life. The reality it seems was no less violent than what is shown in the movie. The movie is a masterpiece. But I won't be too pleased if other movie makes imitate to make such movies lest it can have a negative influence on the immature. A must watch if you are a strong man at heart.",1300579200,2,987,4.570621468926554
