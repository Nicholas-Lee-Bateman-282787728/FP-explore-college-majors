7901906,3,1575236265,"Editorial Review - ""Ride the Desperado and feel the white-knuckled terror generated by its terrifying 280-foot drop."" It's hard for me to think much of a DVD that adds 60 extra feet to the drop of a ride. The better roller coaster documentaries give the real facts and not sloppy assumptions.",1124064000,,292,4.745098039215686
7901907,3,1575236265,"It was a good documentary and the DVD does have seperate tracks with just the rides from each roller coaster that would have been better if it was all done from one spot or allowed the angle button to see the different  angles instead of switching from the car to the ground at random. The menus  stink and can only be accessed from the number pad.  It is in DD albeit  poorly.  It is a good documentary done in true Discover Channel fashion so  for that alone if you *realy* like roller coasters it is a good DVD. Dont  buy it expecting to ""experience"" riding a roller coaster - save  that for super speedway!",946944000,7,610,4.2894736842105265
7901908,5,1575236265,"This is a must see for a roller coaster lover. Awesome in board camera shots make this a great video. Gives recognition to some quiet coasters that are definantly thrilling. Also shows some of the best in the buisness,  including:Raptor,Texas Giant,Magnum, Desperado and many more. For more  thrills the box set is incredible.",925171200,3,326,5.132075471698113
