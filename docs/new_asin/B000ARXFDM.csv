2390481,5,B000ARXFDM,"This is my absolute favorite anime series I have ever seen. This is the series that got me interested in anime and started my slight ""obsession"". I own all the singles of the dvds and still plan to buy this set. The sereies it's self is so well done. It's very well planned with the main story and then two or three side stories that are still wonderful to see. This is not a light hearted story, it has a dark shadow over it most of the time, but it just hightens the intensity.

The story circles around four wolves, Hige, Toboe, Tsume, and the kinda ""leader"" of them, the one that starts the hunt for paradise, Kiba. They are all looking for a way to the fabled paradise and to open it for the wolves, while a noble named Darcia wants to open it for the nobles. They are all frantically trying to get their hands on the flower maiden named Cheza who is the key to opening paradise. The story follows them as they cross the dying earth to open the doors to a better tomorrow. They have very strong unique personalities that make you fall in love with each of them by the end. There are several other characters that pop up often, and they have their own troubles and stories, and help break some of the tension of the story along the way as well.

The voices for all the characters are wonderful (including the voice of Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop as Darcia) and only bring the stories more to life. The graphics are very like Cowboy Bebop and the slight fade to the colors really works for the story. And who can ever complain about music done by the great Yoko Kanno. I wanted to cry when I heard the end song the first time because they're just so moving. I have both the soundtracks and I love every one of the tracks.

This has definetely become one of the classics and I would HIGHLY recommend this series to everyone.",1142121600,2,1830,4.283236994219653
2390482,5,B000ARXFDM,"I'll start this by saying that Wolf's Rain is one of those anime that people are going to talk about for a long time, kind of like Trigun and Cowboy Bebop. The story is as magical as any I've seen, the characters, though stereotypical at first, turn into some truly lovable specimens, and the setting and the atmosphere is convincing, if a bit over-done (post-apocalyptic). After that, the music accompanies this series excellently, the animation quality is so startlingly good that it's hard to believe that this is a thirty episode series (the budget must have been huge), and the voice-acting, both English and Japanese, is superb.

Since this is the review for the box set, I won't say much on the story, other than that it is filled with some imagination and very few stereotypes. It follows a group of wolves, all unique in character, as well as some of their human compatriots and enemies, as they search for Paradise, which can only be found by wolves. Along the way, they battle nobles, a revenge-hungry hunter, and face some tragic losses (and they even face four episodes of repetition in ""flash-back"" episodes, but this had something to do with the SARS scare in Asia, which made it impossible for the animators of Wolf's Rain to do any real work other than recap episodes).

Now, I'd like to talk about the box. It seems American anime studios are beginning to understand that the fans love their soundtracks. Box sets and art boxes are coming with soundtracks more and more often, and Wolf's Rain is no different, other than the fact that the music is Wolf's Rain was excellent. This set also includes all seven of the DVDs, with all the original artwork and features, packed into this awkwardly shaped, though still beautiful, set. A little pricey, maybe, and certainly not cutting edge since Irresponsible Captain Tylor has a mega-set out much like this, Wolf's Rain is one of those anime that is worth the high price, especially when you consider the content and the actual worth. So, if you were a fan of Wolf's Rain when it ran on TV, then now is a the best time to get this set, before it is gone.",1141776000,,2117,4.642666666666667
2390483,4,B000ARXFDM,"Being a long time lover of Wolves, Bandai's ""WOLF'S RAIN"" seemed like an ideal way to go to watch wolves since you could never really get close to them in real life. However, I had been weary of the series ever since its debut on Adult Swim - having serious doubts about the integrity of that television block on Cartoon Network (despite the fact that THE BIG-O and BIG-O II were featured in its block). I even kept my sister from watching due to most of the content in the series and ADULT SWIM itself. Somewhere in the summer of 2005, I decided to take a chance and watch this series little by little with rental DVDs. As of December 24th 2005 - I've completed watching the series: It is now one of the few favorite Japanese cartoons I watch and enjoy.

STORY: The storyline for Wolf's Rain is not so much as complex as it is unexplained throughout the overall series: The story takes place in an almost always used post-apocalyptic time when much of the world has been ecologically devastated and most people live in poverty. A legend is told in the Book of the Moon that wolves are mystical beings who came to the world from a place called Paradise, at the dawn of time. It is also said that, in the future, wolves will, with the help of a mysterious woman called the ""Flower Maiden"" (a being created from the essence of lunar flowers), find a way to return to paradise and in doing so, bring about the end of the world. This legend is difficult for most to believe though, because wolves were thought to have been hunted to extinction nearly 200 years ago. However, the truth is that the wolves have just become very adept at hiding themselves in human society, with the ability to appear human, including the abilities of speech and manual dexterity, while still retaining their lupine senses, agility, and natural weapons. This seems to put the show in the realm of werewolf fantasy, but the wolves' human form is portrayed as more of a mental effect than shape-shifting.

A young White Wolf named Kiba searches for the now ""mythically regarded"" world that is Paradise: He finds his way into a run down city, badly wounded. It is there he meets another wolf in disguise - Tsume, a ringleader of a human gang. Elsewhere a Hunter and his Dog Blue travels into a town one day, searching for wolves due to a tragedy that happened earlier in his life concerning wolves. Since no one believes in wolves, many take Quent Yaiden for a binge drinking crazy wielding a shotgun, never to be taken seriously. Upon traveling through the city he encounters a large White Wolf (Kiba) limping through the city. From there the storyline takes off with several other characters: Hige and Toboe who accompany Kiba, along with Tsume. All four wolves escape the city to find Paradise, and perhaps the Flower Maiden that will lead them there. Many things in Wolf's Rain is left unexplained or never properly explained. A prime problem that seems to plague the fictional history of what happened to the world and the background history on the Wolf characters and Human's alike. Most say the series ended quite abruptly leaving most things undone and out in the open. While I agree with most of the things mentioned in the comment, I actually liked the way the series ended. It gave no feeling that there was going to be a a SEQUEL whatsoever. It was a nice ending in my opinion. 4/5

ANIMATION: The animation for the show is top notch for a series created in 2003: The running animations for the wolves is simply amazing and realistic given the technology used nowadays. Wolf's behavior was strongly studied in development. The four legged canines act and sound more like their real life counterparts as opposed to how they've usually been portrayed in cartoons in any country. Regular human movement was also studied a lot more in this cartoon but still retain the cartoonish movements as expected. The sparsely used Computer Generated images were thankfully, bearable, in this cartoon unike most Anime series which have adopted the CGI ways and animated in everything from machines, buildings to Environments. 4/5

CHARACTERS: The Five main characters, Kiba, Hige, Tsume, Toboe, and Blue all have uniquely developed personalities while retaining the stereotyped ""Follows his instincts and never gives up"" - ""Happy-go-lucky"" - ""innocent and optimistic"" - ""Tough guy, soft heart"" - and ""Outcast/half-breed"" - which is never indulged. The wolf guises were basically an another drawer to the show for me. While the human forms were for ease of watching the show so it didn't end up feeling like a ""talking animal"" show, I found myself wondering why the human guises got more screen time than the Wolf's guises did. Other characters like The Hunter, Cher, Hubb, and Cheza, are nice fillers for diversity in different points of the storyline, which does slightly focus on Cheza later on. The villains are the usual philosophized, prophesied searching for Paradise as well. 5/5

ENVIRONMENTS: The wilderness backgrounds are probably the best part of the environments in this series. From the forests, Iceland's, and deserts, the landscape is excellently painted and look very natural as opposed to their futuristic cities that look the part of almost every futuristic city in Anime cartoons. In other words the earthly backgrounds are the better. 3/5

MUSIC: I never really listen to reviews or read anything on overrated COMPOSERS of any kind, the two most overrated composers being John Williams and Yoko Kanno who did the score for Wolf's Rain (among others). The music is not half bad, the almost foreign sound to the instruments and the way most of the music is utilized plays nicely within the series itself. The score overall could've been done far better. Most of the music sounds out of place in most episodes, mostly the vocal songs. Speaking of which, the themes used (Opening, insert, and ending alike), are nicely written and performed. This is probably most catchy the songs performed by Steve Conte - via ""Stray"" and ""Heaven's not enough."" The songs performed by Maaya Sakamoto, being ""Gravity"" - ""Tell Me What the Rain Knows,"" retain the melancholy emotion carried in a dramatic song. Most of the time ""Gravity"" gets a bit tired at the end of all 30 minus episodes. 3/5

VOICE ACTING: Bandai has once again supplied another one of their animes with excellent US voice acting. Ranging from talents from the children's anime ""Digimon"" - Joshua Seth (Hige) and Mona Marshall (Toboe), ""Outlaw Star""'s Robert Bucholz (Hubb), and Toonami's T.O.M. Steven Blum (Lord Darcia). Kiba is thankfully voiced by a talented actor Johnny Young Bosch (Vash the Stampeed, in Trigun) who's demeanor reminds me of David Boreanaz of Joss Whendon's Angel, only with less brood and more life to it. Kari Wahlgren provides an edge and character to Cher Degri who would normally be the boring ex-wife to Hubb, with a soft voice. Crispin Freeman, like Bosch, is a relatively new voice actor to me, therefore I cannot comment on past works he's done. He played Tsume with convincing charisma that would usually fall on deaf ears with too gruff of a voice if another actor was chosen. Thankfully Freeman manages to sound not so tough and human for at the same time. Lastly Tom Wyner has an excellent 'old man' voice for Yaiden. The other English va's Sherry Lynn (Cheza) and Jessica Straus (Blue) are convincing female voice actors for the limited character's their given, especially Lynn who speaks Cheza's airy-like voice with little or no annoyance (US voice acting 4/5). As for the Japanese actors, their not horrible, if anything their on par with the main US character voice actors. However, listening to Japanese gets really tiresome along with reading subtitles after a good while. Japanese audio is only good to listen to every once and a while (Japanese voice acting 3/5).

DVD: The 1st DVD contains Japanese advertisements and TV spots as well as interviews with the Japanese cast (which was rather boring in all honesty). Almost all seven DVDs contain five episodes if I remember correctly and contain all the expected anime trailers and DVD credits section that Badnai has on all their DVDs. The 5.1 Dolby digital sound for English and the 2.0 Japanese audio is excellent, never sounding dull or unbalanced for a moment. Subtitles as usual are available for the Japanese or any other language you happen to purchase this COMPLETE COLLECTION in. The animated menu featuring the Book Of The Moon was a nice touch one a last note. It all in all has a good presentation and a scores a point higher than Gundam Wing's DVD features do simply because of the content on the first DVD. 4/5

OVERALL: Wolf's Rain is an excellent anime series that was thought out pretty good considering its source in all honesty. Its something I would wanna own personally, and for someone who paid $200 dollars for a Gundam Wing BOX SET, $134.95(?) dollars is chump change when I happen to have that much in my pocket. ------- [a 4 out of 5]",1135382400,12,8995,4.798064516129032
2390484,5,B000ARXFDM,"I love Wolf's Rain, and I wished I could of seen this set before. I ended up buying each of the 60 DVDS for $20 - $30 each. The anime is BEAUTIFUL, after you see the last episode it doesnt make much sense, but if you watch the opening scenes you can somewhat understand it. The ending made me sad, really touching... I had waited for 2 years buying each DVD when it came out, and it was like reading the end of ""Where the Red Fern Grows.""",1134691200,3,438,3.9886363636363638
2390485,5,B000ARXFDM,"I loved this anime, the story arc is excellent and I became invested in the wolves succeeding, even though I didn't know what they were actually trying to do.

The animation in this is perfect, the action is well captured, in both wolf and human form.

The music is well done, even if the theme is a little dated now.

The story begins slow, to help set up the characters, but after 3 or 4 episodes it starts to get interesting.

The characters don't seem overly deep to begin with, but as the show progresses their actions begin to make more sense.",1134086400,,549,4.352941176470588
2390486,5,B000ARXFDM,"This anime series is probably one of my all time favorites. An amazing storyline, creative ideas and unbelievably memorable characters will leave you buying this box set shortly after renting or somehow watching the series.

The only thing I can say I absolutely didn't like was I believe DVD 7, which was a useless fill-in episode (there has been much debate on in fill in episodes so I'll spare you the reader all of that silliness). Anyhow, I'd have to say that's where all flaws get thrown at the door.

With an intriguing opening, you'll probably be hooked after the very first episode (and if you aren't this series probably isn't for you). Unfortunately coming in the middle of the series might be too confusing which is why I suggest watching it from the beginning if at all - once the series unfolds though, you'll see why each and every episode was important.

With beautiful artwork and creativity on the part of the movie's back-story (literally the history behind the post apocalyptic world in which the series takes place), an anime enthusiast will immediately soak this series up for all it's worth.

I'm going to have to warn you though that this series is extremely addicting and not exactly fast paced - though into action animes should stay away from Wolf's Rain, as it is more of an artistic expression via visuals, music, character design, and story design rather than a ""fun"" anime to sit around a watch with your friends (this is also a warning against younger audiences watching Wolf's Rain, as it is an action/drama and unless you like those sort of things, this might not be for you).

Again: amazing series, a must for any fan of anime!!!",1131926400,11,1665,4.707903780068729
2390487,5,B000ARXFDM,"It's often that you see an interesting plot that grabs you right from the get-go. I of course watched it and fell in love. The animation is amazing and fluid thanx to the people who also animated Cowboy Bebop. The characters are deep and interesting.

The music is really good it doesn't sound like Japanese music at all and it plays a good melody.",1130976000,6,348,4.4375
2390488,5,B000ARXFDM,"The moment I watched the first episode of Wolf's Rain, I was knew I had to watch the rest. I was deeply drawn into the characters and the little details that made everything come together... Everything about this anime is great; the music, the texture, the beautiful storyline. This is a must have series!",1130112000,3,305,4.666666666666667
2390489,5,B000ARXFDM,"If you are one of the types that only likes streightforward, continuous action anime, this series is probably not for you.  This is probably one of the most beautifully told stories ever to hit Anime, though rather drawn out.  Well worth watching (after you get hooked, you need to watch the entire series a few times to get all the subtle happenings), this series has some of the best animation (as far as television series go), best storytelling, some of the best charactors and an absolutely outstanding sound track by Yoko Kano.

The story centers around four wolves and their search for a fabled paradise.  As told in ""The Book of the Moon"", when the world comes to an end, paradise will appear on the earth, but only wolves will be able to find it. At the center is Kiba, a white wolf with a mysterious past, who, for unknown reasons, is pushed to find paradise.  Along the way, he finds a pack of wolves drawn to follow him in his quest...Tsume, a punk who uses Humans to revolt against the nobels (the disalusioned warrior), Hige, the careless one who's in it for the adventure, and Tolboy,the once domesticated pup searching for companionship.

But wait...this is not a Di$neyesque story about animals...you see, wolves were supposed to have gone extinct 200 years ago.  But wolves have survived...they have learned to cast a spell making them appear as humans (one of the only regrets is that they never explain how they do this in the series).  Entangled in this adventure is the relentless wolf hunter, Quent.  Wolves, as he thinks he saw, were responsable for killing his family and burning his village.  Now Quent is out to erradicate every last wolf from the face of the earth.  The wolves have found some human (and supernaturl) allies as well.  While sniffing out the scent of lunar flowers, Kiba is captured, during which we meet Cher, the scientist, and her ex-husband, detective Hubb Labowski.  Hubb has become intangled in the mystery of the wolves, as his ex-wife, Cher, is trying to untangle the mystery of Cheza, the maiden created by Nobles from lunar flowers...the maiden that is said will lead the wolves to paradise.  All this, and a dark nobel named Darcia who intends to find paradise on his own.

Complicated?  Indeed.  That's why it takes 26 episodes to unwind this tale.  It's not highly action oriented, but so well done, it's hard not to get compleatly drawn into.  The last two disks (final 8 episodes) are the absolute best, but I must warn you, wind up like a Greek tragity.  If you don't shed a tear (or several), you have no feelings at all.

POSITIVES:  Excellent story telling, great charactors and charactor developement, and a phenominal sound track.

NEGITIVES:  The ending of the story seems a bit pushed, some aspects of the story are not adiquately explained (how the wolves use magic to dusguise themselves, why sometimes they leave human tracks and others paw prints, and how sometimes, disguised as humans, they seem to be able to use hands in ways impossible if the human form is just an illusion).  Also, the quality of animation seems to wane near the middle of the series, but regains the high quality toward the end.

Finally: IF you followed my disk-to-disk reviews, I mixed up disk issues 4,5&6.  I was writing the reviews based on both the Adult Swim initial screenings and a friend's downloads direct from Japan.  I did not realize disk #4 was a 4 episode rehash of the first 3 disks The reviews of disks 4 & 5 should have been for 5 and 6 respetively.  Also, after multiple viewings, the ending does seem more compleat, though I'm still yearning for a continuation, directly from where it ended.

OVERALL: This series is well worth the money...you won't regret it.  Still, if you want to collect disk by disk, skip disk #4.  Disk #5 continues directly where disk #3 ended.  IF you can afford it, collect both original sound tracks as well!",1127692800,68,3900,4.696612665684831

2390498,4,B000ARXFDM,"Wolf's Rain is definitely one of the best anime series I have ever seen. However, I am a fan of drama and fans of ""light"" anime, which do not have a very strong topic such as Dragon Ball or Inu Yasha, should definitely consider twice before they buy this product. The reason for this is that Wolf's Rain story centers around a decadent and dying world in which five wolves, who have experienced many human feelings, suddenly decide to go look for Paradise with the arrival of one of them. With each passing chapter, the story develops the depth of concepts like friendship, love and hate, eventually making us decide what exactly is Paradise towards the final chapter. Because I wouldn't want to spoil the plot, I can only add that the music is fantastic (Yoko Kanno herself, which is the composer of many other great anime series like Cowboy Bebop of the series of Ghost in the Shell), the characters' personality is astonishingly well accomplished (because the story takes place in a very little time) and the drawing is great. Whomever liked the series of Arjuna or even Miyazaki's Nausicaa should not pass the oportunity to at least see the first chapters of Wolf's Rain. Perhaps the only drawback is that one of the DVD's in the collection is only a remake of the first chapters of the series, so if you watch the entire series in a short time, you will most likely want to skip this disc altogether. Anyway, have fun finding Paradise.",1168300800,4,1440,4.62890625
2390499,5,B000ARXFDM,"wolf's rain is quite possibly my favorite anime, but a lot of times when you buy anime series on amazon, the seller isn't honest...what's more, if you care about your feedback rating, you cannot leave them negative comments or even neutral comments, lest they give you negative feedback...also, if there is a place to report these people on amazon, i have yet to find it.

however, wolf's rain is an excellent series. it shares the themes of many anime series, which is that about the end of the world and some loose associations with buddhism...but, it tells it incredibly well, despite the formula. let's put it this way, i think evangelion is a better series with more layers, but this tells a story better. it's a good beginner's series.",1166832000,4,741,4.744186046511628

2390501,3,B000ARXFDM,"After purchasing this because of all of the amazing reviews it got here like ""best anime ever"" I have to wonder if I watched the same anime as these other folks.

I rank this below the likes of Bleach, Full Metal Alchemist, Escaflowne, Berserk, Fate Stay Night, 12 Kingdoms, heck even the first Naruto story arc was better.

While the characters are very likable, the first half of the anime is extremely slow paced and not much happens. The middle disc is also just a full disc of recap episodes of the first 3 discs (filler). Things pick up and the last 3 discs are enjoyable to watch (until you see the ending, which was a poorly done gimmick ending).

I'd say rent this (netflix or something) if you are interested. If you haven't seen a lot of anime you may very well enjoy it. If you are a heavy anime fan though and have seen a lot of different anime you will not be left saying ""the best anime ever"" at the end. There are just so many that are better than wolf's rain out there.

That said it can be a very original anime at times and it does have it's moments, they just never really come together in any kind of rewarding way.",1159142400,8,1136,4.24537037037037
2390502,5,B000ARXFDM,"Awesome Anime...you would be hard pressed to find one that's better. This one was actually suggested to me by a friend and after I watched the first 3 episodes I was hooked. I have watched the entire series now. The story is very well developed and mainly follows 4 wolves on their journey to find paradise which is supposed to be opened by the wolves with the help of the flower maiden. Kiba, Tsume, Hige, and Toboe are the four travelers and for the most part take a human form to fool the humans because wolves are supposed to be extinct. Each character has his or her own distinct personality. Toboe is the youngest of the group and tends to be more scared and child like but he is also driven to prove himself, he grows so much over the course of the show, Tsume is dangerous and wild and even though he pretends to be cold he really likes being part of his new pack, Hige is pretty go with the flow for most of the series, and Kiba is very determined verging on one track minded and seems to sense things the others can't.

If you're not into crying I wouldn't suggest this anime because trust me you will be crying by the end, I think I spent the last 4 or 5 episodes sobbing. But it's a great story and these are great characters. If you buy this anime you won't be disappointed. I loved it from beginning to end!",1158710400,3,1321,4.221343873517786
2390503,4,B000ARXFDM,"There is a subgenre of anime, very possibly inspired by the horrors of Japan's nuclear bombing, that deals with the end and rebirth of the world.  Wolf's Rain joins Neon Genesis Evangelion and Rahxephon in the trilogy of the subgenre's best known works, and is by far the most accessible of the three.

In the vague future, or perhaps an alternate universe, wolves have mastered the ability to create illusions allowing them to survive among humankind, and a legend tells that when wolves join a flower maiden, paradise will be opened and the apocalypse will begin.  As scientists create a flower maiden named Cheza, four solitary wolves join to form a pack.  Kiba, the soul of the pack, has a sixth sense driving him towards Cheza and attuning him to her.  Tsume, the mind of the pack, is calm and rational, offering a needed counterbalance to Kiba's dreaming.  Hige, the body of the pack, is canny and streetsmart, the best at navigating the practicalities necessary to survive.  Toboe, the heart of the pack, is kindness, compassion and innocence personified - and the pack's link to humanity, as he had until recently been domesticated.  Also entangled in their story are Quent, a wolf hunter driven by grief who wrongly blames them for the murder of his wife and son and won't rest until they're dead; Cher, a scientist and Cheza expert; and Cher's ex Hubb, a good man and wonderful husband whose marriage to her was unfortunately a casualty of her obsession with Cheza.

As the wolves join with Cheza and seek paradise, they must deal with the human population terrified of them, the military tracking Cheza down, Quent's single-minded determination, the forces of nature, even darker enemies they are not yet aware of - and perhaps most of all their own hopes and fears about Paradise and what it will mean if and when they reach it.

This is a beautiful, epic story with some of anime's most gorgeous artwork and characters you will very quickly come to love.  The whole series and soundtrack are included, and I'll note here that the fourth dvd can safely be skipped, as it consists of a series of flashback episodes necessitated by a halt in production during the SARS epidemic.  I'll also note that this one is not for kids, as it becomes quite violent and very dark.

2390505,5,B000ARXFDM,"To begin with, the story evolves in a future time or something like a ""parallel"" dimension which has a lot in common with earth. It evolves around four friends - Kiba, Hige, Tsume and Tolboy - who are actually wolfs but are able to transform into humans and a young girl, Cheza, which is basically the so called lunar flower.

As for the story, for an anime, it is honestly complicated and therefore, I will try to describe it as simple as possible without giving so much away. The world is in a very bad shape, war brakes out and in the middle are these five friends who try to find their way to paradise and with the help of Cheza to unlock it. To all this comes a guy named Quent who tries to kill every wolf alive, and the reason is that wolfs are supposed to have killed his family (something that proofs later on to be a crime that has been ""accomplished"" by someone else). Quent has also, for his hunt, a half female wolf. To make things more complicated there is a female scientist Cher, who is so fascinated with the entire wolf/paradise situation that would do everything to follow their steps. What basically turned her into a ""fanatic"" about all this is that she holds a book named ""The Book of the Moon"" which basically explains, more or less, what is going on. Her ex-husband detective Hubb Labowski, will risk everything in order to make her love him again and win her back. To all this comes a noble man Darcia, who is actually a wolf as well, but his wife got a disease and the only way to help her is through Cheza. Well, if I am not mistaken, these are the main protagonists.

As for the story, the protagonists have to go through various difficulties during a period of war. Furthermore, ""earth"" is falling apart and they are running out of time. Moreover, as another reviewer has already stated it, is that the series are very emotional, especially towards the end where, lets say, people who you started to like will die. The character development is very good and romantic-love relations will evolve (but have nothing to do with nudity). In the end all pieces come together with the exception of the last minute which gives you a finish in the idea of Evangelion. The animation, with a few exceptions, is very good and the music superb.

To sum up, the shows are seriously very good. Therefore, if you can afford the money, you should definitely buy it and surely will not be disappointed.",1143590400,7,2412,4.464852607709751

8079141,5,B000ARXFDM,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday at her request, and she was overjoyed.  Video and audio quality are excellent and she's really into the story line.  Anime is right up there with Harry Potter with her.  Since she is writing her TOK (Theory of Knowledge) term paper for her senior high school IB Diploma addressing cultural aspects of anime, I can't complain.  By the way, Amazon is selling the Wolf's Rain CD sound track separately, but be aware, that CD is included in this DVD package, though no mention of that is made in Amazon's description.  I ordered the CD when I ordered the DVD set and had to return the CD (We didn't need 2 copies).",1216684800,,651,4.483050847457627
8079142,5,B000ARXFDM,"Having first watched this series at a relatively young age, I must say that to fully understand this series you should watch it at 16+. Yes, it's a cartoon, but if you're not familiar with anime and want to buy this for your kids, look elsewhere. However if you're a mature anime fan, you've come to the right place.

This series blew me away. Everything from the smooth animation, realistic character development, and flawless score by Yoko Kanno just fit perfectly. The pacing is perfect; never too slow or too fast. You learn as the characters learn and you're never beaten over the head with plot points.

The character development is where this show really shines. The four wolves and Cheza; Detective Hubb and Cher; Quent and Blue; Darcia and Jagura; all the characters get ample screen time to tell their stories as you learn why they are the way they are. In other shows, you don't want to learn about the side characters because they're irrelevant/boring. Not here. All the characters are interesting in their own way and serve a purpose to the end. Their problems feel real, as does their pain.

Another aspect I love about this series is that it never delves into the typical comedy that's in so many other anime shows. I always hate watching something dramatic broken up by a pointless comic moment for no apparent reason, making it feel like an emotional rollercoaster *cough*Chrono Crusade*cough*. The drama is realistic, not over-the-top. Wolf's Rain never gets too wrapped up in itself which is the main reason the drama works so well.

At the end of this series I was heart-broken and emotionally drained. The entire series builds on itself, coming to a spectacular climax in the last 3 episodes. If you don't shed a single tear by the end, you must have no heart.

One tip for anyone watching: skip the four recap episodes in the middle of the series, right after the Fallen Keep episodes. The characters just talk through four episodes of already viewed scenes with no new info, so unless you just want to watch for the sake of watching, skip it. It breaks up the drama for too long and it's harder to get back into the meat of the story.

If you like epic stories that don't get bogged down in their own drama, you should check out Last Exile or Samurai 7.",1191715200,,2276,4.621287128712871
