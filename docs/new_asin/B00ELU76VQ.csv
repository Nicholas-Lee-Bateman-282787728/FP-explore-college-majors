8606756,5,B00ELU76VQ,"Introduction:
This is a major undertaking by Euroarts and is also a major investment for potential purchasers. It is the first of a planned sequence centred on the well-known and respected musical film director, Bruno Monsaingeon.

This publication consists of a substantial book plus 6 discs available in both Blu-ray and DVD formats. It could be viewed as a tribute to the singer who died in 2012. This review will deal with the book and the 6 discs as separate sections separated by dividing dots as follows:

.....................................................................
The book:
The book contains copious illustrations taken from throughout Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's long career and these are reproduced to a high standard. The text itself is printed in German, French and English and laid out in three vertical columns per page on all pages not devoted to photographs. The text contents are essentially biographical and deal with the singers life in sections related to dates (1925-43; 1943-49; 1949-63; 1963-77; 1977-93 and 1993-2012).

After this biographical coverage, which is thorough and easy to follow, there follows photocopied extracts from the singer's diary covering significant events 1948-2005. The book continues with the German texts of song cycles - Dichterliebe; Liederkreis; Die Schone Mullerin. The lack of translations for non-German speaking readers will be a probable source of irritation for some collectors and seems to be a lost opportunity to cross linguistic barriers.

The final part of the book deals with the two films, Autumn Journey and Last Words, and contains a printed rsum of the contents of those films. This allows the reader an opportunity to consider all the points and details of the two films at a steadier pace and to allow for reflection. This section is also amply illustrated with photographic material.

Disc 1: The film - Autumn Journey

This film is the one with which the accompanying book concludes and is a thorough and absorbing autobiographical portrait of the singer. There are no contributions from the film maker and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has a particularly easy manner of delivery as if speaking to the viewer personally. The frequent musical examples taken from archive material cover all aspects of his activities be they those of singing, teaching or conducting.

The soundtrack is in German with the option for English or French translation heard over the top of the singer's voice. This proves to be easy to follow and is arguably better than the use of subtitles as it is more personal - a feature of the films `feel.' However, the absence of subtitles for all the sung extracts is a definite minus point for non-German speaking viewers and a lost opportunity of communication - an essential ingredient from the singer's viewpoint.

The film, at 101minutes, is too detailed to deal with in any depth here but suffice it to say that it covers the 35 years of the singer's operatic career during which he sang over 60 roles, the many hundreds of cantatas and oratorio roles and more than 3000 lieder and songs. This is achieved with a disarming ease of delivery and readily conveys Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's sense of joy which he describes as fundamental to the performance of Lieder.

.....................................................................
Disc 2: A Schumann recital recorded at the Nuremberg Opera house in 1991 with good stereo sound engineered by Erato. Playing time is 71 minutes. Subtitles are provided in English and French.

This disc is entirely devoted to Schumann's settings of poems by Heinrich Heine with the main works, Liederkreis and Dichterliebe being framed by 8 other lieder settings of Heine's poems. The public recital is marked by a complete absence of applause or any other suggestion of an audience until the ends of the sets. Nevertheless there is a strong sense of involvement due to the skill of the director and the use of camera angles which are detailed without being invasive. The recital is one of a series under the overall title of `Masterclass' and it is at that level that the performances are delivered. Many will consider this a definitive recital. The pianist was Harmit Holl who provides exemplary accompaniments.

.....................................................................
Disc 3: A Schubert recital recorded at the Nuremberg Opera house in 1992 with good stereo sound engineered by Erato. Playing time is 85 minutes. Subtitles are provided in English and French.

This disc features Schubert's the first set of 23 songs known as Die Schone Mullerin. Once more the audience are particularly silent and the two musicians deliver interpretations and performances worthy of the description of `Masterclass' and which many will consider as definitive. There is a feeling of rapt audience attention throughout the recital.

.....................................................................
Disc 4: A Schubert recital recorded at La Salle Pleyel, Paris in 1992 with stereo sound engineered by Radio France. Playing time is 85 minutes. Subtitles are provided in English and French.

On this disc Fischer-Dieskau is partnered by Christoph Eschenbach and the subject of the recital is Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin set 2. Once more the musicianship and performances are exemplary and such is the standard of delivery that any dissenting thoughts are silenced. As with the other discs in the series the recital is delivered with unwavering authority, skill and understanding of the various texts.

.....................................................................
Disc 5: Film - Last Words. No date of recording but published just after the singer's death in 2013. The period covered is from early childhood to 2012 and is in the form of leading questions and fulsome replies.

The film is constructed as a sequence of topics which are then enlarged upon and amplified by Fischer-Dieskau. There is a fair degree of revisiting topics and ideas touched on in the much earlier `Autumn Journey' film but in this case these topics and reminiscences are very fully developed. The `chapter' headings are: father; beginnings; repertoire; teachers; soldier in Italy; post-war years; 1948 operatic debut; core vocal techniques; languages; curiosity; conductors; stage direction; wife - Julia Vardy; predecessors and opera roles; random considerations about opera and lied; the interpreter.

This amounts to a detailed and absorbing revisiting of numerous relevant topics caught at the very end of Fischer-Dieskau's very eventful life. The format is more directed in terms of structure than the earlier film but that seems appropriate at this stage in the singer's life.

.....................................................................
Disc 6: Schubert-Additional masterclasses. Recorded at the Hochschule der Kunste in Berlin with various `students' being advised and directed by Fischer-Dieskau. Recorded in 1992 in stereo.

This is the least involving film for non-German viewers as neither voice-overs nor subtitles are provided. Both of those omissions reduce the impact of the subject material to guesswork. It will, no doubt, make instructive viewing for all those who are conversant with the German language, and especially, the sung repertoire.

Conclusion

This is a major project and the combination of material within the very informative book and at least five of the six discs will make this a very tempting proposition. The quality of the presentation is generally of a very good standard as one would expect and demand of such a premium priced purchase. The lack of subtitles in disc 6 especially and for the sung extracts in disc 1 seems a regrettable oversight.

With that one proviso this can be summarised as an absorbing package. This is a premium product at a premium price and one which deserves a place for potential purchasers with an interest in the singer and his extensive repertoire. They should not be disappointed.

In short this is a premium product delivering a unique presentational concept with further titles in the pipeline.",1413158400,9,8244,5.530579825258141
