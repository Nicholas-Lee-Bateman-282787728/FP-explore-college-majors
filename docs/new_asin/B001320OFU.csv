8248728,5,B001320OFU,"and BUY THIS DVD. I just watched it with my five-year-old daughter and laughed harder than I have in weeks; I'm pretty sure I broke my squigglyspooge. Not only is it bust-a-gut hilarious; it's educational too, both for kiddos and for grown-ups who never had a chance to indulge their curiosity about all things creepy and crawly. There's also a mighty fine sermon regarding leaving things as you found them and not getting your butt kicked by bugs. (Okay, insects! I was listening!)

Tony is my hero.",1374364800,,500,4.747126436781609
8248729,4,B001320OFU,"Cute video - has some adult jokes (not dirty, just ones that will make adults laugh but kids might not get it), but it's really for kids. It's kinda silly - perfect for my 8 and 4 1/2 yr olds. They have watched it several times.
Not the most refined cinematography, it is a bit fuzzy for some parts and it's not the most recent technology for special effects, but it's cute. It's definitely educational in nature.",1271203200,,413,4.376623376623376
8248730,5,B001320OFU,"This has to be one of the best videos I've ever watched with my kids!  Tony Thank you!  My kids have watched again and again over the summer and we even purchased one of the Bug Nappers.  My kids keep going back to it like a bible to their backyard adventures and my only complaint is now my house is full of jars!
To anyone who knows a youngster interested in bugs this video is for them.
I don't understand the other viciating review.  I guess their house had a flat tire that day!
5 stars all the way.",1255392000,,504,4.0606060606060606
8248731,1,B001320OFU,"The quality of this DVD is horrendous.  The kids looked at me like, ""you're kidding, right?""  Many times you could hardly hear what was being said, as if they were talking into a can very far away.  The humor in it is very corny and pathetic.  I wouldn't waste your time or money. Wish I hadn't.",1245888000,,295,4.214285714285714
