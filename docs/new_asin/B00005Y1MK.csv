There are some tricks to learn and some tricks helping to guide how to work smart in Lightwave.  However, the visual quality was originally designed for VCR quality.  Thus, it appears quite poor in DVD format.  Not bad to take a look, it just like someone guiding you trhou the project and more interactive than learning from books.",1026432000,2,437,4.786666666666667
8295282,5,B00005Y1MK,"hi
this is an excellent way to ""get"" it in lightwave.
due to lightwave's odd interface and non windows way
of working this is a teriffic way to learn the basics of the program.
the quaility of the screen capture is excellent and much better than a typical vhs video, brad is a great teacher, entertaining,  informative and engaging the user.
this is a worthwhile purchase for any lightwaver new to the program.
the project based portion of the dvd really shows you the typical workflow of constuction a model and animating it.
if you had to choose a good way to get up to speed in lightwave
i'd say get this and the inside lightwave 7 book by dan alban.
go get it!",1019779200,3,664,4.354838709677419
