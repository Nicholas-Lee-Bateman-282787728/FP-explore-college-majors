8548303,5,B00A8MGJ1O,"First, I do not mind the ""shortcomings"" of this DVD, which, after all, was recorded in 1991.  The singers matter--and I again have to disagree with previous reviewers: ALL three principals--Graciano Pasquetto, Mauricio Frusone, and particluarly Keiko Fukushima-- were outstanding, Thanks to Hardy Classics for taking the trouble to preserve the only staged performance of this negleted opera. As for the background, no one has mentioned that the libretto was fashioned from a drama by Voltaire, just when Europe was ablaze with the theories of ""the noble savage""--which he cleverly and improbably turned into ""the noble European"" (he hated Rousseau).  I've completed my Verdi collection.  By the way, he wrote 26 operas--some of which reappear up to 4 times in several revised version (Don Carlo/Carlos, for example)",1436486400,2,816,5.409448818897638
8548304,3,B00A8MGJ1O,"First let me state I feel this opera has a bad rap.  I myself find it 'better than average' early Verdi.  It may not be a masterpiece on the order of Nabucco or Ernani, but so what?  I say it holds its own both musically and dramatically against a good half-dozen of Verdi's early operas of his self-described ""galley"" years.  (I could name a few that I think it easily surpasses, but in no mood to start a war at the moment :)

Do we need to give it a ranking anyway?  Would we not want to hear EVERYTHING that one of the greatest, if not THE greatest opera composer in history spent six months of his life working on?

Now, as to this performance.  It is a 100% traditional performance (NO Eurotrash costuming or set design).  It is very well played and sung, with no apologies necessary for musical content.  That is of course with the understanding that we are talking about local talent, no visiting superstars.

About the performance.  This was the type of show that should have been enjoyable.  It is about the Incas, and who doesn't enjoy an opera about the Incas????  It even features plumed headdresses and armor-coated warriors.  And as I say, well-played, well-sung, and well-acted.  So why can't I recommend this DVD to anyone?

Well, sorry to say, the recording quality, both video and audio, is simply terrible.  To use technical jargon, it sucks--just about as bad as it could possibly suck.  The picture is way too dark, and while the orchestral sound is fine, the voices are away in back.  I am inclined to think that in person, the experience of both sight and sound was as it should be.  And I am inclined to believe the production was going so well they decided at the last moment (probably on the last day) to have it taped.  So they brought in a crew and taped it with inadequate preparation and no chance for test shots or retakes.  And they probably had a dedicated mike feed to the orchestra but not to the singers.  I can't figure out any other reason why the production should appear so successful and yet be so dreadfully recorded.

So as it stands, this is the only video of Alzira, apart from a concert performance on Tutto Verdi, and who the heck wants a concert performance?

So I think we have to settle for audio-only CD's for now, and await a decent video from La Scala or Berlin or wherever ... but I sure hope they mount a traditional production like this!",1422576000,,2394,4.45852534562212
8548305,3,B00A8MGJ1O,"At the risk of being proclaimed a heretic by opera lovers in general and Verdi afficonados in particular, I have to declare that this work by the great Italian maestro has to be his worst; well, if we were to rank his 28 operas, one of them has to be at the bottom - this is it!  Surprising, because when it was originally produced in 1845, Verdi had already mounted 8 operas, including the far-superior ""Nabucco"", so, one would think that he was progressing steadily - and he was, because a few years later he produced a trilogy of great operas (""Rigoletto"", ""Il Trovatore"", and ""La Traviata""); there is no way, whether storywise or musically, to disguise the fact that with ""Alzira"", the reknowned composer hit the proverbial bump in the road to musical immortality - and he himself knew it when he called it ""ugly"". To the credit of the Teatro di Parma back in 1991, they courageously mounted a production of this rarely-performed work, but unfortunately, it compounded its weakness for technical reasons.  Whoever was in charge of lighting must have been using flashlights instead of spotlights; or is the problem with the dvd cameras? In any case, there are long stretches when everyone is in the dark: both on stage and in the orchestra floor. Perhaps, this is the Director's way of blurring the traditional space/lines which separate the audience from the musicians and the actors/singers: instead of just having the audience sitting in the dark, let's have the actors sing in it as well. The accompanying notes tell us that Luciano Damiani, the Director, had built his own theatre in which he removed barriers between audience and actors, and he brought this concept to this production.  To be fair, it is a very interesting concept; the soprano sang one of her arias standing in the middle of the orchestra, which was elevated to the extreme that the back row of musicians was frequently seen in front of the singers, and chorus members and actors at times came up to the stage from the sides of the theatre, but I honestly cannot say that the ""gimmicks"" added any enjoyment to the performance.  Two of the three principal roles were very well sung: the title role by Keiko Fukushima, the soprano, and that of the Governor of Peru, Gusmano, by Giancarlo Pasquetto, whose baritone voice is as good as any I've ever heard.  Mauricio Frusoni, the tenor lead, can best be described as a journeyman - good, adequate, but not exceptional. I have no complaints about Conductor Maurizio Benini and the Orchestra; indeed, if my rating depended solely on them, it would have been higher. The dvd has a 4:3 picture format, dolby digital 5:1 sound as well as PCM stereo, and close-captioning.  The English subtitles could not have been written by someone who is fluent in the langauge, but, they'll do. Finally, my advice is that you buy this dvd only if, like myself, you need to complete your collection of all of Verdi's operas.  If you are just curious about this little-known work, you might want to wait for the price to come down - let's say to less than ten dollars.",1358208000,14,3071,4.718283582089552
