How can I complain this situation?
And how can I get back my stuff?
This is very disappointing.",1333411200,,171,4.375
8199140,5,B000R7I49A,"I was never a fan of the gimmick of trying to market MMA as a ""team"" sport. I just want to see the best fighters and match-ups possible regardless of who the fighter is associated with.

That said, the IFL put on some awesome fights. Chris Horodecki, Ryan Schultz, Brad Blackburn, Rory Markham and others really brought it.

I wish there were more IFL DVDs available.",1276732800,2,367,4.545454545454546
8199141,4,B000R7I49A,This DVD has clips from 35 different fights from season 1.  It does a nice job of explaining the teams and rules.  I have never watched it on TV so I bought the dvd and it was easy to follow.  It does feature several well known UFC fighters.  I think its worth the $15.00 I paid for it.,1190505600,3,286,3.8793103448275863
