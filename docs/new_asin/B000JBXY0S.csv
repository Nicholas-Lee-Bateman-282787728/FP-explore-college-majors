2670116,4,B000JBXY0S,"THE ROMANTIC FAVORITES COLLECTION (from UNIVERSAL) is comprised of four quite popular British-based films that humorously explore several aspects of love. Transfer quality of these single-title DVDs is ""top shelf."" A must-have for Hugh Grant fans!

SYNOPSES--

ABOUT A BOY--  Best Screenplay Oscar-nominated story of a wealthy but selfishly irresponsible fellow (Will) who pretends to be a single parent so that he can hit on women at support group meetings. Through one of these relationships, Will meets a 12-year-old (Marcus) who is struggling in school. His efforts at helping Marcus teach Will how to be a better man.

BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON--  The sequel to ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" has her relationship with lawyer Mark Darcy fallen on hard times after only a month. Bridget travels to Thailand with her ex-boss (and love interest), and while there she lands in jail after an international incident. Will Mark come to her rescue?

LOVE ACTUALLY--  Explores the ups and downs in the love lives of 12 different people during the month or so prior to Christmas.  Some of the stories intersect. The engrossing script is deftly handled by a superior cast-- includes several great cameos.

NOTTING HILL--  An unassuming British bookshop owner has two chance meetings with a glamorous and famous American actress and for both of them it's love-at-first sight (or second).

2670119,4,B000JBXY0S,"I got this primarily to get ""Love Actually""  the rest was just bonus for the price.  But I did find it odd that it is the sequel to Bridget Jones.  Why put a sequel in a box set without its original?

Anyway quality was good and I don't regret the purchase but now I need to go get the original cause it just feels silly not to at this point.",1201478400,5,342,3.842857142857143

To say that I am bitterly dissappointed would be an understatement!!  Not only was it a complete waste of money but also a sad reflection on Amazon for not notifying the purchaser of the requirements needed to use the product.  Poor Poor Poor",1175904000,4,417,4.1875

2670185,4,B000JBXY0S,"Each of these films are wonderful in their own right.  If they'd have replaced Bridget Jones with something else, it would be perfect.  Obviously not the seller's fault on that one, just an observation.",1321488000,,202,4.911764705882353
2670186,4,B000JBXY0S,"This collection is worth the price, new, just for Love, Actually.  Notting Hill and About A Boy are both fun movies though I probably wouldn't buy them individually. The Bridget Jones movie is the second one, which (IMO) isn't as good as the first one, but it's nice to find four delightful movies in a collection that's so affordably priced, especially since the special features are included.

As individual movie reviews are available elsewhere, I'll just touch on the quality of the collection and the packaging.  I'd give this set five stars if it had included the first Bridget Jones instead of the second, or if the very clever packaging didn't have discs overlapping each other.  Since the code the DVD player reads is located on the printed side of the disc, you should probably flip the bottom two DVDs to make them last longer.

This would make a great Valentine's Day gift or Christmas stocking stuffer.",1292976000,6,915,4.802547770700637
2670187,2,B000JBXY0S,"The other 3 dvds were great, but ""About A Boy"" won't play on ANY of my DVD players, or my laptop, or on my pc, or on my friends' laptops, dvd players, or pcs.",1257292800,,158,3.676470588235294
2670188,5,B000JBXY0S,"This is an awesome pack if you like romantic comedies Hugh Grant style! ""About a Boy"" is the least attractive movie of the series but nevertheless a pretty good one. Widescreen.",1253059200,,177,4.741935483870968
2670189,4,B000JBXY0S,"Okay, I love Hugh Grant, regardless of his off-screen antics. I love this collection, except I wish it would have included ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" instead of ""The Edge of Reason,"" a really bad movie that made Renee's character look like a total moron. IMO, Beeban Kidron (director) should never be allowed to make another movie, because she destroyed this one. Anyhow, I adore the other three films and have watched all four of them many times. In TEOR, I basically fast forward to the Hugh scenes. He's the only thing worth watching in this one (and the deleted scene of Bridget interviewing Colin Firth as ""Mr. Darcy--hysterical), unlike in BJD, with the also irresistible Firth. Too bad Kidron made Firth look so weird in this one. I don't focus on technical aspects because I don't know anything about that stuff, but all 4 DVDs look and sound good to me! Enjoy!",1246406400,,866,4.741721854304636

2670192,5,B000JBXY0S,"After watching Two Weeks Notice I felt that I would like to see Notting Hill and so my search began, I happen to love Amazon and so I typed in Notting Hill and my selection came back and as I browsed thru them this four movie boxed set showed itself, it had Bridget Jones-The Edge of Reason, About a Boy, Love Actually & Notting Hill and the price was right for all of these in one package.
I had known about three of these films Notting Hill, About A Boy & Love Actually but I was unsure about Bridget Jones and I figured that getting three out of four pretty good films was worth the price, now after watching Bridget Jones this turned out to be a very good deal.
The Seller I dealt with was Spot On and I paid with PayPal and recieved the mailing in less then a week.
If you like English Humour then you will not be sorry that you purchased this collection, it's well worth the price.
Enjoy, Scott",1229040000,,900,4.148571428571429
