8124757,1,B000FN32U2,"It's weird not hearing any of the Space Thunder Kids voices in this even though it was released by Joseph Lai, heck its weird to see that its not in his faux-anime style.
This would be a great lesson on how NOT to make a terrible animated movie.
Look at it! The animation is TERRIBLE! This looks like a Philips CDi game!

This movie is horrendous beyond everything I have ever seen. The animation, the CGI, the lips sync, the voice acting, the story, the pace of the movie, and everything else that I'm missing is absolutely horrible.

I am ashamed that this movie actually was made by grown-ups and was actually in stores (wherever they are) to sell. Please do not buy the disc, or you will regret what you're looking at.

This is so mind-blowingly bad that I can't even begin to comprehend how bad it is. All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 looks like a MASTERPIECE compared to this. I can't even believe I just said that. Sorry, but this has no meaning here. And I have no more to say.",1377734400,,976,4.293478260869565
