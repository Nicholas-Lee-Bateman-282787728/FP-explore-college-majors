778325,5,6304096739,"""B-29: Frozen in Time"" is a great, great story. But why? Being an aviation buff, I would obviously be partial. However, this story can appeal to many more people. It is more than just your average, ""boring"" feature. It's a story of adventure, of risks and shows that even the best of plans can go awry. It is also very bold and involves people who may be perfectly sane or who may be half-nuts (Some spoilers).
The story revolves around a B-29 bomber named ""The Kee Bird"". In 1947, this plane crash-landed in the Arctic Circle. The crew survived and were rescued days later. But the plane was abandoned, lost but not forgotten. Though it was known where it was, no body attempted any recovery. It would be too risky and expensive and would require an eccentric and bold risk taker. However, one person could do it. Meet Darryl Greenamyer.
A former test pilot, Greenamyer flew the U-2 and SR-71 aircraft for Lockheed. In the 1970's, he built an F-104 Starfighter jet from scrap and set a low altitude speed record. The plane that will be used for shuttle flights on this mission will be another of his wonders: A Caribou transport. After the Caribou and the team arrives, the documentary goes into a brief flashback about the Kee Bird's last flight. The jubilance the modern day crew feels far contrasts to what the original people there felt. Two crewmembers are interviewed, providing details about how it felt afterwards as they waited for help. During their interviews, we see footage of the plane's interior and archive footage taken after the crash.
Greenamyer and his team were trying to beat the clock and thus took many risks. The first one, when the tires lose air from falling off, is to use propane to refuel them. The second is to fly in a bulldozer, even though it is dangerously overweight. Also, as the weather worsens around the site, the decision to try to keep shuttle flights going to Thule Air Force Base.
As the video goes, the team members go through many different feelings and emotions and ours also change with them. We feel the frustration Darryl is facing as work proceeds slowly. We marvel at how backbreaking the work is in this inhospitable region. We cheer for them when they succeed in getting the engines roaring and are saddened at the death of a team member. But even he is daring and fool hardy, Darryl knows when he is beat and wisely decides to leave the location and the B-29 before conditions worsen.
Nine months later, however, he returns to get the bomber out of there. The bulk of the work was done last year, but the team is still kept busy. They battle constant oil leaks and have to keep the engines warmed in order to get the lane out of there. Success seems to be in there reach. But the fates have other plans, it seems.
The ending always brings me to tears. What is so tragic about it was that, essentially, it was finished. It would have flown. However, the attitude of the team members reflects differently. They have been through this stuff before and are willing to do it again. Even though all the money, planning and manpower has been wasted and there is nothing but debts to show, Darryl states at the end ""This is my game and I'd do it again"".
If you are still one of those who thinks documentaries are boring, you need to watch this inspiring, entertaining and educational program.",1017878400,10,3340,4.586956521739131
778402,5,6304096739,"I won't spoil the punchline to this NOVA special.  The Kee Bird emergency landed in the early 1950s north of Thule Greenland on a frozen lake bed.  Several times since then she has surfaced only to be buried under snow and ice.  Warbird Classic (I think) did a multi-page page article on this ghost of Greenland during the mid 1980s.  This video is at times tense, at times jovial and most of all, very enlightening from a historical standpoint.

The B-29 bomber, is a part of WW2 history, and as such, deserves preservation.  These men gave it their best efforts, but they came up short.  They are to be saluted for their efforts, by all who study and enjoy WW2 history.  There may well be many more wrecks out there, and this viewer hopes there are intrepid people willing to locate them, not for their personal sakes, but for the cause of history.  I definitely recommend this dvd.  JRV",1436227200,,599,4.440366972477064

778561,3,6304096739,"OK.  How could you go wrong? If you're into adventures, near impossible 'field fix it up' challenges and conditions, WWII vintage aircraft and the B29 in particular, this is a good movie ""documentary"" for you.  I use ""documentary"" loosely, though, because it really wasn't a thorough, well sequenced and covered factual story.  It was more like a 'docu drama' or some half baked reality TV show with a bunch of sound bytes, snippets and tight photo/clip short shots --  mostly of their supply plane burrowing into the snow upon landing, etc. or 'so and so' grimacing in pain or frustration or worry.  Many details were left out (back story, actual repairs made, etc.).  They focused more on logistical problems (what did they expect with that old DeHaviland Caribou?) and primarily the engines, props, gear and recovering of the rudder.  I think this version must have been truncated/edited down somewhat from the original TV airing...cause it simply seemed to jump around alot with no real cohency or focus.  For example, when they first landed on the frozen artic lake to ressurect the Kee Bird, it looked like a lot of work had already been done to it.  Certainly, it was sitting properly on it's gear, pointed in a good direction or a nice level cleared area (of snow), with a ladder next to one of the engines, etc.  This DVD starts when they first land and only have a month or so to get her in flying condition....under the most demanding, crude, austere conditions! So there must have been previous prep work, no?  I would have liked more 'back story' or previous activity details covered.  In the end, this is a good story about the men themselves (though not much character development or focus) and how one man with a vision (and alot of $$$ backing) tried to save an intact and flyable virtually extinct (and very valuable) B29.  Of course it was very SAD that their amicable lead master A&P mechanic died.  Poor guy.  You get the impression he was willingly pushed to the limit and the big guy in charge didn't really care or notice how sick he was till it was too late.  But not enough time was spent on how the men lived in between work shifts, so it was hard to get the total 'hardship' context in better focus (hence my no doubt unfair sentiment).  The ending was SAD too. More than.  Haste makes waste...and so did that B29 get wasted...all due to a race against time and a seemingly impatient project leader/pilot who wanted ""just to get it in the air"" back to Thule before the WX turned bad and the money ran out.  Too bad he didn't spend more time working on a proper runway surface....just watching it do a high speed taxi over 'off road terrain' was disburbing enough.  It was a wonder that poor B29 didn't fail structurally from that alone.  And the tragic resulting 'incident' probably saved the crew from being a smoking wreck at the end of that 'ice lake runway' that appeared to be too short anyway....even for that B29 in its former prime condition with strong new engines.  In the end, the 'end' wasn't very uplifting at all.  Kind of depressing actually.  Nice try though guys.  :-)  Maybe you got some of your LLC investment back with this show.  And maybe there was more to this story and 'plot' than we know...or were told.  What did I learn from this DVD?  Careful who's dream, challenge and business plan adventure you sign on board with ... especially if you're going to some remote hostile place like in the Arctic. BTW...I'm a long time USAF pilot/aviator...who obviously loves planes.",1388361600,2,3524,4.647819063004847
