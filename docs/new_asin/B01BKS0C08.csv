7659192,5,B01BKS0C08,"I can't speak to the users experience in the other review, but my copy of DM2, while also missing the sleeve, does appear to be new and came with the digital code. Great value for the trilogy!",1457568000,2,192,4.216216216216216
7659193,3,B01BKS0C08,"When I first opened the package everything looked good. All 3 movies in shrink wrap as described with each movie also in shrink wrap. I thought it was odd Despicable Me 2 didn't have a sleeve like the other two movies. Turns out it's a used copy. There is no code included and there is sticky paper stuck on the inside cover (see pictures).

7659203,5,B01BKS0C08,"My children love these movies, and we were thrilled to find the trilogy at such an incredible price! We had previously owned the first two (Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2), which became scratched in a very short time after my children watched them repeatedly nearly every day last summer.

The Despicable Me trilogy is a fun, light-hearted kids movie, but it does contain themes that more sensitive parents may find offensive, but should be taken in stride (after all, these are made for children, and not meant to be taken seriously). For example, in the first movie there are references to ""burping"", ""farting"", and a caricature of the main character sitting on a toilet, followed by ""I go to the moon, I sit on a toilet"". An Iron maiden is shown with juice coming out the bottom as a child gets stuck inside, which could cause nightmares in younger children (however, neither of my sons found this frightening). The children sleep in hollowed bombs, and the entire house is filled with dangerous medieval weaponry and torture devices.

The second movie shows the main character being tazed, another character being shot with a tranquilizer, unsafe driving, fart guns, sexual inferences (trust me, if a young child understands they are sexual, you have a completely different problem on your hands), two characters flying through the air on a rocket attached to a shark, and a dangerous purple bunny (potentially frightening to children).

The third movie has similar themes-multiple characters exposed to unrealistic dangerous situations and ridiculous science.

This is not all inclusive of the potential issues with the trilogy, but it is not meant to be. My family and I enjoyed all of these movies, my sons have not displayed any deviant behavior as a result of them (with the exception of a brief period of constantly saying ""I go to the moon, I sit on the toilet"" followed by hysterical giggling), and there is plenty of tongue-in-cheek (non-sexual) humor for the discerning adult.

I would take these movies any day over the much less interesting disney alternatives that are literally mind-numbing. At least the producers thought of everyone in the family when creating this movie. It is truly something for adults and children alike.",1466640000,,2248,5.0

7659229,5,B01BKS0C08,"I've reached a point in my adult life and as a Dad where I'd honestly rather watch animated family films over the majority of the rubbish Hollywood has produced in the last decade or so.  Dispacable Me has been one of my absolute favorites and the sequel does not disappoint. With the newest release my 3 year old son has now become a Minion fan and this 3 pack hit a Lightning Deal just at the right time! This is a great set especially if you don't own any of the trilogy yet.  We have The Bluray to watch together on Daddy's TV, the Dvd for his playroom and the Digital for travel. The set comes nicely packaged and shrink wrapped together. As other reviewers have pointed out DM2 was missing the sleeve but that's not an issue for me, especially considering that as titles become older and depending on sales volume the sleeved versions may no longer be available anyway. All my copies were brand new and included the codes. I have not had a chance to redeem them yet but when I do I will try my best to update. At the price I payed and with the free shipping it certainly could not be beat!  I may even be more excited to add these to our collection than my son is!",1458086400,,1170,4.214285714285714

7659231,5,B01BKS0C08,"Received all 3, can tell they're new. All had brand new discs and codes that worked. No slipcover on one, but there are a lot of movies that don't come with those anyways, so i don't understand why people are making a big deal out of it, not worth a star removal. I'm very happy with what i received!",1457827200,,300,4.101694915254237
7659232,4,B01BKS0C08,"Like other reviewers have pointed out, my copy of Despicable Me 2 also came without a slipcover. I even returned and exchanged the set of movies, thinking it may be a fluke, but the second set arrived the same way. Despite the missing slipcover, the codes were included in all 3 of the movies I received.

The reasons for the 1-star reduction are the missing slipcover (I'm a bit of a collector, so things like slipcovers matter to me when I purchase a Blu-ray) and the fact that there was a square of paper glued to the inside of the second movie's case, partially underneath the DVD copy. If you look at the photo the first reviewer posted, mine was in the same location as theirs. This to me is a scratch hazard.

Having noted all that, my DVD copy is probably not going to be watched, and I can likely find a cheap slipcover on eBay, so those minor complaints don't outweigh the fact that this is a great way to purchase all 3 movie combo packs for a great price.",1457740800,4,967,4.3076923076923075
7659233,4,B01BKS0C08,I received mines yesterday and I am happy with the trilogy. Definitely cant beat that price for all 3 films and 9 extra mini movies on top of that. I also noticed that part 2 didn't come with a sleeve. I was a little upset about that but its still brand new and I also received the digital codes for all 3 films. Great collection to have especially if you have kids. I just wished part 2 came with a sleeve but other than that GREAT MOVIE and GREAT PRICE!!!!,1457568000,3,458,4.1
