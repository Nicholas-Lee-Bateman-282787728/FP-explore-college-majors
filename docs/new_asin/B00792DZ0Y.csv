5063801,5,B00792DZ0Y,"Wonderful, well-done documentary about the personal experience of German resistance.  Shows the seldom-seen German perspective.",1411344000,,127,7.466666666666667
5063802,5,B00792DZ0Y,"This was such a great insight on a young half German-half Jew in Berlin and her experiences trying to survive Hitler's regime. It includes home movie footage along with news clips as she narrates the world she finds herself in at age 14 and through her later teens during the war. While the Love Story influences the people and their actions, I appreciate that it is not the main focus of this documentary-style narrative. Like many others, the persons in this saga would never had survived without the help from a few courageous folks and some purely random luck. I do wonder though, if it was really so random or if there were strings pulled, favors bought, that Mrs. Cords is either unaware of, or kept to herself. Nonetheless, we are very fortunate to have this narrative preserved for us in Jutta Cords own words and voice. Poignant and Inspiring, to see and hear her emotional reactions to different parts of her story.",1403568000,7,925,4.680981595092025
5063803,5,B00792DZ0Y,"Excellent movie!.  Exciting, factual, romantic.  This is an incredible love story in Germany during the horrors of the war.  The home movies are superb!",1396915200,4,152,5.25
5063804,5,B00792DZ0Y,An unbelievably moving and poignant love story narrated by a still very beautiful Jutta. Her strength and determination during such a horrific period of time is an inspiration to anyone looking for/fighting for a better way of life.,1393891200,3,232,5.131578947368421
5063805,5,B00792DZ0Y,Very recommended. I enjoyed it even though it was documentary and I expects to be a fiction. Nevertheless it was very well delivered. It is great real story with great positive message.,1390262400,,185,4.8125
5063806,5,B00792DZ0Y,Very interested in WWII history.  A very interesting story and very well done.  We will watch it again for sure.,1385942400,,112,4.55
5063807,2,B00792DZ0Y,I really didn't get the point of this film. I think it may have made a better love story/romance novel. The footage makes it interesting but not that monumental of a story.,1371081600,,172,4.40625
5063808,5,B00792DZ0Y,The title isn't a perfect fit. Get two DVDs so you can loan one out and keep one for your history collection.,1360454400,,109,4.0
5063809,5,B00792DZ0Y,"It would be difficult to add anything to Edward Lee's thorough review, so I will comment on a particular angle of this documentary: I think it would be a good vehicle for introducing children and teenagers to the history of WWII and the Holocaust, or to teach about contemporary examples of totalitarianism rising up out of a democratic society (Hitler began consolidating power only after having been democratically elected.) Indeed, given the time at which I write this (January 2013) it could also be used as a cautionary tale as to why citizens of a democratic society should not allow their elected representatives to disarm them -- and, in the case of Americans, to destroy their 2nd Amendment rights. Hitler's rise to power and his abuse of his OWN people contains many lessons for us.

This is an unusual documentary because it deals with Hitler's abuse of non-Jewish Germans. What he did to Jews, Gypsies, Slavs, and all the nations he invaded or attempted to is so horrific one never hears of the price paid by many non-Jewish Germans who loathed Hitler and fought against him as they could. Many of the best Germans, as this documentary showed, paid with their lives for their resistance to the totalitarian tyrant they had democratically elected.

The deeply personal story which lies at the heart of this documentary allows us to learn more about the universal through the particulars. As a tool for educating children and teens, it can open their curiosity to question events and provide a springboard to many historical explanations as to what was going on as this love story unfolds in the midst of Nazi Germany's prosecution of WWII. Like a Shakespearean history play, the extreme violence takes place ""offstage"", making this especially suitable for introducing a grim subject to children.

In addition to teaching history, it is a powerful tool for discussing the many difficult moral choices that Jutta and her friends and family must make throughout the progression of the war. This is all the more compelling as they so often chose to risk themselves in pursuit of the right and the good, in the fight against evil. A film such as this can help a parent innoculate children immersed in the contemporary school system which teaches them there is no good or evil, right or wrong, and that all cultures are equal. Jutta, her friends and family are the antithesis of moral relativists/moral cowards. Many forfeited their lives to the courageous choices they knowingly pursued.

For those already deeply knowledgeable about the history of this era, you will find Surviving Hitler offers a unique perspective, and even a rare happy ending. It is a true story that reveals man's capacity for both moral depravity and enobling self-sacrifice. Notably, the entire film is imbued with gratitude -- another worthy lesson to be drawn from this gem of a documentary.",1359331200,5,2874,4.95643153526971
5063810,5,B00792DZ0Y,"Not only is this a beautiful and well-made story, but it contains a message that really needs a wider audience.  Most Americans have been taught, and are happy believing, that Hitler rose to power because Germans were somehow flawed as a people.  We hear about the French Resistance, but we never hear about the German resistance.  Here is the true, personal story of a German woman who participated in that Resistance, as did her parents and future husband.  Their story helps us all to realize that any nation, if it's not careful, can give in to the bad ideas of a ""strong leader,"" and how hard it is to fight them once they achieve power.

Buy this movie, watch this movie, pass it on to your friends and teachers.  It's entertaining, but it's also important.",1349740800,19,763,4.614814814814815
8512523,5,B00792DZ0Y,"A very moving tale told by a beautiful woman who survived WWII with the love of her life and both her parents, even though her mother was half Jewish, they hid an enemy of the state in their attic and her love was involved in the Valkyrie plot on Hitler's life. To try to imagine how they all came out alive is truly miraculous and the eloquence and grace with which Mrs. Cords shares her story is an honor to watch.",1485043200,,416,4.148148148148148

8512532,5,B00792DZ0Y,"What an amazing documentary this is, combining romance, deception, an attempt on Hitler (known as Operation Valkyrie), the threat of concentration camp and the participants never leave Berlin! It begins with an adolescent (Jutta Cord) who finds out she is Jewish, bringing home a questionnaire for her parents to fill out. Her voice draws you into the web of this multi-level story with the same beguiling charm that drew her as a girl to her SS officer as if forbidden love posed little danger. After a few visual returns to her childhood still photos and movies, the lines of her face fade and you become to see and feel what this captivating woman experienced so completely as the German forces lost ground. Inter-spliced with newsreel footage of the times, the desperation and tension of impending fear and doom play out. Her parents had more secrets. This afternoon tea of a discussion with Jutta proceeds deeper. However, this documentary/intimate Berlin-years memoir is spellbinding to its surprise finish. Seldom, if not at all, do we hear about the aristocratic resistance within Germany from a participant who was connected to an attempt on Hitler and other dangers. Her family did not stop with resistance alone, they harbored a wanted Jew in their attic. For her love of an SS officer alone Jutta risked death, but combined with the risks her parents took you will experience the depth of her (and her parents) convictions put to action. A most exceptional story, charmingly told, supported by home movies and letters of that dangerous time, one you do not forget.",1412899200,4,1576,4.973484848484849
