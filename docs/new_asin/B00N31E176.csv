6608186,5,B00N31E176,"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised! It was amazing, better than I had imagined it would be and it was definitely worth the wait. Thank you to all of the Santas... Santa Russell, Santa Jim, Santa Bob, Santa Claus (Santa Frank) and Santa Mick Foley for sharing a part of your lives with us. Many people think about Santa only during the Holidays and this gives us a look at what their lives are like behind the scenes. Life is not always perfect and happy and this movie shows that. I laughed at times and I cried at times... I must say - towards the end of the movie it tore me up inside, seeing some of the Santas alone at Christmas. NO Santa should ever be alone on Christmas! I love you all and appreciate everything you do! Christmas would not be Christmas without you! Thank you for giving us a glimpse at some of the real men behind the suit. I have heard some people say terrible things about the movie - they must not have seen it, or they made their mind up before they even saw it. Definitely a must see! Not for children, of course, but I knew that going in. Still there was nothing shown that you can't see on TV after dark and I found absolutely nothing offensive about ANY of it.",1415923200,5,1200,4.199134199134199

6608201,3,B00N31E176,"Normally I enjoy watching documentaries and biographies of various individuals day-to-day lives. But I couldn't bring myself to really appreciate I am Santa Claus. The film is about different Santas from all walks of life. Some are poor, some are gay, some are faithful, and one is even a former professional wrestler. What ties them all together is their love for Christmas and bringing joy to people during the Holidays.

This film is best watched with family and friends around Christmas time. It feels more appropriate because the content is not really interesting and I found myself wanting to fast-forward to the end, when all the Santas finally get to be Santa for the kids.",1420848000,,681,4.921739130434783
6608202,5,B00N31E176,"Great documentary, touching, a little sad and funny, too. The guys who dedicate themselves to playing Santa Claus for the enjoyment of millions of children are unsung heroes. Mick Foley is terrific on his journey into this world.",1420329600,,229,5.052631578947368

6608205,3,B00N31E176,"Wow! Talk about an earth shattering concept of Santa! Maybe it's better not knowing what's behind the suit. The one common element, the spirit of Santa Claus. Definitely not a movie for the kids!!!!!!!!!!!!",1419638400,2,206,5.088235294117647
6608206,5,B00N31E176,"Most of the documentaries Ive seen this year have been pretty bad. The first ones that come to mind are based on male fans of My Little Pony, and the rest after that haven't been much better. After one of my best friends said good things about I Am Santa Claus, I quickly got to watching it. Man, am I glad I did. I Am Santa Claus is probably one of the best movies Ive seen all year. Its not perfect by any means, but no other movie, has gotten me as emotional as this one. And its a happy movie for the most part too! Fans of Santa, Christmas, Mick Foley or people who just plain like seeing good things happen will get a lot out of it. This is the kind of film you can watch at any time of the year, despite the person and time of year its about.

We follow 4 men who dress up as Santa Claus each year, as well as Mick Foley, who has a very strong connection to ol Saint Nick, and wants to try being Santa this year. The 4 regulars include a man whos living with his daughter because hes unable to get work anywhere else and has financial troubles, a gay man who doesnt have a family and is in a long distance relationship, a Christian who takes part in a big holiday album, and a tattooed construction worker who has legally changed his name to Santa Claus. Needless to say, its a pretty diverse group who all play the same person. We get to see what their lives are like leading up to the Christmas season, troubles they have, and we also get a good look at how important being Santa is to each of them. And as you may or may not know, theres a convention for Santas where they talk about Santa-things, and this year, they have a new leader whos into the swinger lifestyle. A lot of people aren't happy about it, feeling like it ruins the image of Santa.

Fortunately, that section doesnt take up a lot of time.

Aside from the one or two times (like what I just mentioned) when the film gets a little off-track, I Am Santa Claus had me from beginning to end. There is nothing here that isn't sincere; when a child sees one of the men out at a store or in a parking lot and is happy to see him, you can see that it makes their day just as much as it makes the kids. I got happy every time I saw a Santa happy. The one I connected the most with was Jim Stevenson. Im straight and have two daughters of my own, but this poor guy, as happy as he was, broke my heart three times. Hes such a nice guy, and of the four featured here, I felt he played Santa the best, but he just kept hitting little bumps during filming, causing him to get choked up or start crying during interviews and phone calls. After the second time it happened, I got worried any time hed show up again, wondering if another bad thing was going to happen. The first instance is the only one Ill mention here, and its early on in the documentary. Jim talks about how one of the things he loves about being Santa is how it lets him into the lives of others. Even long after hes gone, hell still be in the photos of children, wholl be showing those photos to their children, and they can say to them that they got to meet Santa. This part was so unexpected that I had to pause it for a minute just to catch up myself. Watch this movie and tell me you don't want the best for him.

While everyone else is interesting in their own way, the only other Santa that I got a lot out of was the man who changed his name to Santa Claus. He hates his day job and wants to start up his own barbecue business. He has tattoos all over his arms and is confident without coming off as being full of himself. During the Santa convention segment, when people are talking about the new leaders lifestyle, Santa Claus goes up to the guy and talks about it. And guess what? It turns out hes the first one to sit down and talk to him. The other two Santas are good too, though the first one, Russell, is mostly shown trying to find a new home or another job after his former employer quietly cuts ties with him. And the Christian singer, Bob, actually doesnt get much time at all. Halfway through the movie, I forgot all about him and what his story was. He seemed cool though. As for Russell, I just wanted the guy to get a break because I felt so bad for him. All those financial and home problems made him seem bitter about things, but when it came to being Santa, the guy pulled through.

Mick Foley was still the biggest surprise. Finding out that he loves Christmas so much that he has a whole room in his house full of decorations was awesome, as well as seeing how seriously he took becoming Santa. From getting the right suit to taking advice from one of the best Santas out there. In the chance that the movie isn't that interesting to you, you need to watch it until the end for his final scene. Its one of the most heart-warming things Ive -ever- seen in a movie. When Jim wasn't getting me teary eyed with his bad luck, Mick and another special someone did with their great Christmas gift.

I cant say enough good things about I Am Santa Claus. Watch it as soon as you can.",1419638400,3,5035,4.111788617886178

6608209,5,B00N31E176,"I was originally drawn to this documentary because I'm a big fan of Mick Foley. I thought it would focus on his journey to becoming Santa a bit more, but I was pleasantly surprised when it focused more so on the lives of the other men who play Santa every year. There is humor, there is a touch of sadness, and there are moments when your heart will be warmed. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I did an HD rental, but I'm considering getting this one on Bluray just to add to my collection.",1418947200,,488,4.202127659574468
6608210,1,B00N31E176,"Terrible movie.  This movie is not intended for children.  One Santa belongs to a sex club one has trouble with drinking and using four letter words.  One even changed his name legally to Santa Claus.  Give me a break, just because you changed your name to Santa doesn't make you Santa.  Mass murderer Charles Manson also said he was Jesus.  The examples these guys live are not ones I would want children to follow.  I appreciate those Santas who lead by example!",1418601600,,464,4.585365853658536

6608215,5,B00N31E176,"Great documentary that delves into the lives of people being Santa.  I found the raw, real life look at these people extremely interesting.  Some of them are good-spitited and in it for the fun of it.  Some of the men are down trodden and dependent upon the role playing as a means of income.  Some are just down-right obsessed and border mentally ill.  The Mick Foley segements also show how people can get the ""bug"" of becoming Santa Claus and what that experience is like for the first time.  Great documentary, but have no mistake that this movie is not a children's film, that was obviously not the intention.  I had read a review about the movie not being for children and I could see how with the cover of the film having Mick Foley and the Christmas themed title and cover someone may think that it could be child-safe....but it is not.",1417651200,,844,4.477124183006536

I would not recommend watching this with young people because it has some very inappropriate material that we had to fast forward.  The Santa from Michigan dropped a few F-bombs and was in a drunken stupor.  It is unfortunate that Santa has been portrayed in such a foul manner.
