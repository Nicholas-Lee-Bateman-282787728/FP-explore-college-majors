8029755,5,B0002NY8BW,I bought this DVD for my grandkids and they absolutely love it.  The stories and lessons learned are wonderful. And the music is good too!!!!!,1425427200,,142,4.68
8029756,5,B0002NY8BW,"Beautiful tellings of timeless stories from Africa.

Our favorite is 'who's in Rabbitt's House'. Very clever and funny. ""I am the Long One. I eat trees and trample on elephants"". Poor rabbit has an intruder (the Long One) in her house that won't let her in. Others try to come and help but to no avail. But frog, who rabbit didn't trust, who has been watching and rolling with 'mirth' at all the attempts, may just know what to do.",1399939200,,431,4.3875
8029757,5,B0002NY8BW,"I am picky about the movies I let my kids watch.  That being said, I find that these stories are wholesome, cute, and spark lots of conversation and spontaneous reenactments on the part of my two kids (4 & 2).

They are not mushy-gushy or knight/ princess hyper-sexist fodder.  They are enchanting folk tales that arrive at the ""moral of the story""  in funny and surprising ways.  I also recommend the book, ""Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears""  by Verna Aardema.  If you love this you might also love Julia Donaldson's books (and DVDs) ""The Gruffalo"" and ""The Gruffalo's Child"".",1373414400,,581,4.75

8029762,5,B0002NY8BW,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter, because I remember these stories from my own childhood in the seventies! They were just as good as I remembered, and my daughter enjoyed watching them as much as I enjoyed revisiting them, and they opened a dialogue between us where she learned a bit about her mom being a kid once too, so I was VERY happy to have bought this!",1258329600,2,369,4.211267605633803
