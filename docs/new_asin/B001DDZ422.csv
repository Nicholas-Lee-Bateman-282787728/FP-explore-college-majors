Alice (Viviane Romance) gets out of jail after taking the rap for a crime committed by her lover, Alfred (Paul Bernard), only to find that he has recently broken the law in a more serious fashion: After a botched holdup, Alfred brutally murdered an elderly woman. Just when the couple think their days are numbered, town outcast Monsieur Hire (Michel Simon) begins to fall for Alice. Realizing that the locals despise the pariah, Alice uses her charms to trick him into taking the fall.

Panique is a French film directed by Duvivier, made in 1946 and released in 1947, starring Michel Simon and Viviane Romance. The screenplay is based on the novel Les Faincailles de M. Hire by Georges Simenon. The film was released in the United States as Panic. In 1989 Patrice Leconte remade the film as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsieur-Hire/dp/B000VAHQUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsieur Hire</a>, with the title role played by Michel Blanc.

 ""After the war [many] narratives were spent on some kind of revenge. Carne's Les portes de la nuit, Bresson's Les dames du Bois de Boulogne, Lacombes Martin Roumagnac , - the harrying of a Jew to his death in Duvivier's Panique, and a number of Simenon and Steeman thriller adaptations rife with violence and revenge - all of these films attest to a need to project the immediate past on to a different set of narratives that are removed from the immediate arena of guilt (although Panique comes uncomfortably close). Dark social realism is to be found in a considerable number of films during the five-year period after the end of the war. The films of Clouzot and Decoin are the most remarkable in this context in their fierce, almost cynical pessimism, but the works of  Allegret  and Julien Duvivier in that period come close on their heels.""

Many noir elements and the final scenes surely inspired Hitchcocks opening scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertigo/dp/B000I9YLXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertigo</a>. The movie itself carried me through three distinct phases: the first third the careful depiction of several of the minor characters, everyone from a butcher with a sick wife and several children to a thoughtful detective, a middle section dominated by a tender love story driven by the evil femme fatal, and the final harrying of the Jewish hero to his death -- but with a final ironic revenge all his own.
