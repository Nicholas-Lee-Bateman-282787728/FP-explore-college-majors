8331055,1,B001OOOK2U,"I was not real happy with this set.  They are so [...] about what they release and withholding all kinds of facts, that these are hardly worth watching.  These cases have been thoroughly sanatized and we are only seeing what they want us to see. All the shows in this series are starting to look alike.  Ditto Season 3.",1249084800,,319,4.372881355932203
