8741149,5,B0182NZ5P6,Awesome ride for those who spin indoors! I've always wanted to do this ride and now I can virtually. The photography is amazing and riding with real professional cyclist on one of the longest hill climbs on earth virtually is unbelievable. I really pushed myself and felt it all the way!,1459209600,,287,4.647058823529412
