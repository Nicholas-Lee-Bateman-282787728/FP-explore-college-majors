2679180,5,B000JU7KAE,"I made the mistake of taking the ""professional"" reviewers' opinions seriously, and thus I missed seeing this film on the big screen last summer. Instead I ended up seeing this as a freebie on a flight last week. I was completely blown away by this beautiful picture, and I am really upset at this point that I listened to the Hollywood Elite and ended up seeing this picture 8 feet away from an little 12 inch TV on an airplane instead of a movie theater. I have just put in a pre-order for this on Blu-ray, and will be watching it on my big-screen next month. This is a great fantasy film that is destined to be a classic!!!!!",1163894400,,627,4.277310924369748

2679185,5,B000JU7KAE,Underrated movie that is often overlooked. Captivating performances by Giamatti and of course the stunning Bryce Dallas Howard. Forget that it's a Shamalyan movie and just watch it for the good bit of storytelling that it is. A character study for the ages.,1456444800,,257,5.0

2679206,2,B000JU7KAE,"This movie started out well, but really dragged out through a good deal of the scenes. Not enough focus on the Lady in the water and too much about the apartment super and the tenants.",1392508800,,184,4.285714285714286
2679207,1,B000JU7KAE,"Along comes this putrid no-reason-for-it-to-exist junk. At least ""The happening"" was so bad it was hysterically funny. Don't even get me started on ""Signs"". A race that is deathly susceptible to water comes to a planet that is almost all water?  And then there is this. ""Lady in the Water"". This is just unwatchable. Anyone who ever wondered why Dick Cook at Disney tried to talk M. Night out of making this and sent him away to another studio, need only watch a few minutes and you will know. Sometimes studio executives DO KNOW what they are talking about. Not always. But sometimes. Please, somebody stop this man from getting behind a camera.",1361491200,5,646,4.716814159292035
2679208,2,B000JU7KAE,"I am a fan of the first four Shymalan directed movies (yes that includes The Village). Also read the book about the making of (and almost non making of) Lady in the Water which intrigued. Love Bryce Dallas Howard. She being the title ""Lady"" I was interested to see this.  LITW tries to create a new mythological story, and it is ultimately a messy failure on all levels except the acting (from all seasoned professionals at least). It is not moving, it is not scary, it is not thrilling, it is confusing and pointless. Scatterbrained would have been a better title.  Whatever has gone wrong with M Night apparently started well before the making of this film.  It is sad and inexplicable, but this movie does not continue his streak of hits, it is a turd sandwich from a formerly talented chef - do yourself a favor and skip it.",1354579200,,828,4.506666666666667
2679209,4,B000JU7KAE,"Not bad, great movie. Unfortunately, it does not have mouse interractive features; therefore, does not work that well on a computer. I would have given it 5 stars if it did.",1354320000,,173,4.612903225806452
2679210,4,B000JU7KAE,". . is how my teenage son described this movie.  It's high praise from him and I think it is exactly right.  Whatever you think of Shyamalan's mythical bedtime ""story,"" the movie includes one of the best performances by Paul Giamatti to date.  For those who follow Shyamalan, it is giving nothing away to reveal that the movie is not really about the Lady in the Water (anymore than Signs was about aliens, or The Sixth Sense was about ghosts).  The ""story"" is only a vehicle for exploring the redemption of a shattered soul (another common theme in Shyamalan).  Giamatti's character's soul is indeed shattered, and the revelation of the depths of that shattering is heartrending.  Put this on the shelf next to John Adams and Cinderella Man.",1323820800,3,742,4.7578125
2679211,5,B000JU7KAE,"Unfortunately, the trailers for M. Knight movies create unrealistic expectations. This poor marketing, which I suspect is done through the studio (not the director), has been the critical undoing of more than one M. Knight film.

I want to throw my two cents in, based on the film rather than some expectation create by the studio. This film is simply a work of art. The acting is superb and the casting makes for interesting dynamics. The story's setting (an apartment complex) is a bold choice on the part of Shyamalan, in that it is so ordinary and mundane. Yet it is exactly this ordinary and mundane setting, coupled with seemingly ordinary and mundane characters that make this film so compelling. It is the juxtaposition of the seemingly ordinary and the extraordinary that speaks to our own everyday experience of life. Too many of us live seemingly mundane and ordinary lives, yet hope and search for greater meaning. This movie is able to reach that part of me that wants to believe. The story unfolds in such away that is profoundly affirming, which is refreshing because we live in a world that is so often not.

I believed this film was a risky move on the part of Shymalan when it came out, and over the years it appears he has paid the price for the decision to create films such as these. He is simply not making crowd pleasers, and because of that and poor marketing, the crowd is often not pleased. However, I am. The only Shyamalan film I'm not sure about is The Last Airbender, but I haven't seen it yet so I will reserve judgement.",1322870400,,1552,4.579136690647482
2679212,1,B000JU7KAE,"Simple and clear: One of the worst movies in history. Period. The only reason the great cast didn't commit suicide yet is because they must be still spending the money they charge for appearing in this movie (?). M. Night Shyamalan writes, directs and, yeah, also act, not a simple cameo Hitchcock style as he used to do. I began to see this ""Lady"" three different times, and three times I quit in different parts of the movie. In my fourth I decided to finish seeing it and give it a fair opinion: yep, I lost my time, my money and my mood.",1280707200,2,541,4.262135922330097
2679213,2,B000JU7KAE,"M Knight Shamalayan made a name for himself with the movie The Sixth Sense, and for good reason.  It was a great movie with a great story and a not entirely predictable ""surprise"" ending.  I also enjoyed his follow-up film, Unbreakable (yet it wasn't too well received.)  Each of his later films, however, have left me disappointed.  Lady in the Water is no different.  He keep trying to  string insane story ideas together, only to cap them off with a ""surprise"" ending.  A surprise ending is only a surprise if you're not expecting it!  Another problem I have is how his characters always seem to just accept whatever's going on in the movie.

This film is about a water nymph that's trying to save the world from humanity.  Or maybe it's to save humanity from themselves...  Anyway.  She shows up in the swimming pool of an apartment complex filled with very eccentric tenants.  The landlord of the complex is the man who finds her, and immediately clings to this nymph.  He's not quite too sure what to do with her, but conveniently there's an Asian family (Japanese, I think) that just happens to know the legend.  So, to appease the elder lady of the household (who is the expert of the legend,) he goes through some rather silly exercises.  Once he knows this legend, he goes to all the other tenants for help.  They all immediately buy into his tale and pitch in right away.  As the movie progresses, things become more and more convoluted.  Eventually everyone figures out what to do, and the ""surprise"" happens.  Seriously...  I wasn't surprised in any fashion.  In fact, I predicted what'd happen.

Here are the stats:

Violence/Blood/Gore:  Almost none.
Boobs:  None.
Likable characters:  Maybe the landlord?
Plot devices that made sense:  None.
People in this film that look like Jeff Goldbloom:  M Knight Shamalayan.

Over all verdict:  Maybe watch it on cable if you're having a hard time sleeping.  Otherwise skip.",1272412800,3,1930,4.789634146341464

2679226,3,B000JU7KAE,"I watched this movie in Blu-Ray.
I am only going to comment on the
quality of the picture. Compared with dozens of other
Blu Ray discs I have seen this one was very poor. It looked more like standard DVD than
Blu-Ray.",1238025600,,217,4.190476190476191
2679227,1,B000JU7KAE,"M Night lost my respect with ""The Happening"", and I hope it's temporary, as I prefer films with weight. His films, conceptually, always seem to want to convey a deeper message, meaning or metaphor. This is welcomed for me, but this film, Lady in the Water was a mess. The characters seemed to be created like caricatures, and for me, could not be taken seriously. The film felt 10 hrs long, and the entire film was a garbled mess for me. PQ and AQ clear, but not the best. Technically-4/5. Film 1/5. Ugh.",1226448000,2,504,4.43010752688172
2679228,4,B000JU7KAE,"I've enjoyed most of Night Shyamalan's movies and this is no exception.  The movie has feeling and hope which you don't get in many movies these days.

Paul Giamatti does an above average job, as he often does.  Playing the role of someone just trying to get by and do the right thing, even under extreme diversity, seems to be his cup of tea.",1223078400,,343,4.328125
2679229,1,B000JU7KAE,"In my opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's movies have been on a steady decline since Sixth Sense.  I didn't think it could get any worse after The Village, but he proved me wrong.  This movie is PAINFUL.  I don't know who this film was made for.  It's a fairy tale to stupid and unbelievable for adults and too boring for kids.  Bryce Dallas Howard's ""prince"" in this movie is the bald, fat, stuttering Paul Giamotti.  Giamotti is a great actor, but he cannot carry a film as a lead.  M. Night Shyamalan is known for having great twists at the end of his movies, but this one has no surprise ending which leaves the viewer wondering, ""What was the point of this movie?""

As for the blu-ray, this is the most underwhelming picture I have yet to see on a blu-ray.  The colors are drab and dirty.  There is no ""pop"".  The film is grainy, flat, and dull (it is a BD-25 encoded in MPEG-2.  The audio is all over the place too.  I had to constantly adjust the volume on my system so I could hear all of the whispering.",1209600000,3,1006,4.231578947368421
2679230,4,B000JU7KAE,Story pretty much well kept in hand. Not spreading into too many directions. a few thrills and funny moments. Sound stage and video as good as BD can be expected. Enjoyed a lot. Did not look extras. Quite typical M. Night Shyamalan's product might say...,1199145600,,254,4.666666666666667
2679231,4,B000JU7KAE,"I enjoyed it immensely, and think it is his best effort yet. It is a fantasy story set in a suburban apartment complex with humor, drama, suspense and, of course, the wild use of imagination. Shyamalan really let me lose myself in the fantasy and get enthralled in the imaginative characters. The acting was appropriate, the directing was great and the writing was very smart. The only place I thought it lacked was in plot coherence, but it is easy to overlook it when you're flirting with fantasy. I especially liked how the story entwined with different historical fairytales, making for great post-movie conversation, which carried on for days.",1181606400,,648,4.954128440366972
2679232,2,B000JU7KAE,"Its quite a nice story, but the picture is not worth the money for a blu-ray disc. - Also the sound on my DVD is not exact synchronized with the picture!",1170547200,,153,3.967741935483871
2679233,1,B000JU7KAE,"Not a good DVD to check out Blu-ray (often dark) and an amazingly poor movie.  Paul Giamatti is good, but some of the actors are terrible and the special effects are very uninteresting.  The movie just could not hold my interest.  I just didn't care what happened to the characters, so it was not frightening.",1169251200,2,309,4.581818181818182
2679234,4,B000JU7KAE,"Lady in the Water is a movie that feels like it is trying to be some other movie most of the time.  M Night Shallymollydingdong's flick is correctly advertised as a ""fairy tale,"" has a comprehendable story, and, a first, doesn't seem to have the ""OMG HUGE PLOT TWIST"" element that makes the other movies made by this director famous.

Paul Giamatti gives a terrific performance, although some of the ""supporting"" characters are quite dull.

The Blu-Ray version of this movie has nothing the standard dvd did not, and although the picture and sound are improved, it is not drastic.

I liked this movie more than any other movie M Night has made, save Sixth Sense.  For a good family film, almost in the same vein as Time Bandits (minus the brittish ""wit""), this movie hits the spot.",1168473600,2,781,4.630434782608695
