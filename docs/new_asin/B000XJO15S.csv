8416376,3,B000XJO15S,"With a travel video, I like more geography -- show me on a map approximately where we are and where we are going.  Felt this one adequately caught the spirit of travel in Cuba but the quality of the production was uneven.",1399507200,,221,4.261904761904762
8416377,4,B000XJO15S,This documentary shows the great tasks accomplished by Cuba under the revolutionary government although it intended otherwise. I would love to see more documentaries that focus on the positives of Cuba and how the country could further develop.,1377302400,,244,5.447368421052632
8416378,1,B000XJO15S,"This DVD is not worth it.  Not only is the narrator difficult to understand when attempting to say the locations in spanish, it's a travesty that so much of this beautiful island is not even mentioned.  Only La Habana and Pinar del Rio, while beautiful, are mentioned.  The rest of the island is ignored.  Not worth the money.  Such a shame when one had high hopes of seeing the whole island.",1208304000,,392,4.464788732394366
