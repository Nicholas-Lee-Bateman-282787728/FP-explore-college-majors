8114352,2,B000EU1HQC,"great for people who have tried some of his videos before, not so great for someone who has never tried anything like this. Didn't give a person to follow that is doing it a little slower!",1366588800,,188,4.25
8114353,4,B000EU1HQC,"Ok, so the cardio video is only about 30 minutes long.  It's shorter than most of his cardio workouts, which are normally about 45 minutes long.  You do about 12 - 13 minutes of cardio and warm up and then you put on the bands.  As with all of his videos, you don't have to use the bands if you don't want to or aren't comfortable... or you can substitute hand weights, which I like to do sometimes.  It's a pretty well-rounded workout that will get your heart rate up in a relatively short amount of time.  It moves quickly with little time in between moves.  My only complaint is that at the end, he decides to just throw about 3 or so of abs onto the end of the workout.  Your abs are your core muscle that all your other muscles depend on... I would have liked to have seen a little more work on them.

The Lower Body BootCamp is unbelievably intense.  He does give you a good 8-9 minutes of stretching and warm up, which is good because you need it.  You can utilize the bands again in this video if you want, but I would definetely start out not using them.  There is a lot of kicking, and a lot of squating.  By the end of the workout, Gilliann and Shelly (Shelly is his daughter, and Gillian is visibly in awesome shape) look like they wanna cry.  That's how tough it is.  Kudos to you if you can keep up.  Either way, it's an awesome challenge.

By the way, anyone who needs the bands can get them at billyblanks.com or they are available with some of the bootcamp series videos.  I got mine with the ""Elite BootCamp"" Series.",1236902400,4,1534,4.198630136986301
