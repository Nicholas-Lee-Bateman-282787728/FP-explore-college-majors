But what a trip, apparently clowns were a big thing back then as they keep popping up on this DVD; there's Clarabell from The Howdy Doody Show, The Magic Clown, and the spokes-clown from The Super Circus. Diver Dan was a show were a diver interacts with puppet fish, pretty ingenious for a time before Jim Henson. Also interesting is the Gilbert Toy promo.
