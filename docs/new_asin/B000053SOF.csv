1392606,5,B000053SOF,"This movie set out to look war in the face and tell the truth, and that's what it does.  It captures the human and psychological costs of war to the men who fight it, which is why, although the film was initially shelved because commanders thought it was too depressing for wartime audiences, Chief of Staff George Marshall believed it should be shown to all Americans.  Marshall wanted Americans to know the costs of victory, and the depth of the contributions made by fighting men.  He believed that a society which understands war will work harder to support its fighting men.  This film is still moving and powerful in a low-key but deeply affecting way.",1002844800,22,658,4.695652173913044
1392607,5,B000053SOF,"""The Battle of San Pietro"" is John Huston's landmark 1945 documentary covering a pivotal battle in Italy during World War II. This 40-minute film features some of the most riveting film footage of the war that you have ever seen. If you think this might make ""The Battle of San Pietro"" something like the ""Saving Private Ryan"" of its day, then you will not be surprised to learn the National Film Registry agrees; they added this film to their list in 1991. This videotape also includes a wartime recruitment film, ""The Marines Have Landed.""  Very appropriate for history classes covering the war interested in contemporary combat footage.",1000512000,11,639,4.97196261682243

1392630,4,B000053SOF,"This is a painful work.  It has two, simultaneous effects on me.  On one hand it puts me in awe of the dedication and sacrifices of our young men During World War II.  On the other hand it evokes a complete revulsion for the utter madness of war.

The battle took place in Italy.  As a student of World War II, I feel that there is an emphasis on the war in France after D Day.  The battles in Italy are well documented but seem to be regarded almost in some sort of secondary position.  These battles were savage And there was tremendous suffering.

One thing that really struck me was that the documentary shows the actual faces of American soldiers killed in battle.  I cannot help but wonder what effect that could have on the family of the soldier depicted.  Did anyone consider that?  The end of the documentary has a somewhat idealized, glorified, aspect to it, as though it was intended as a propaganda device.  I had mixed feelings about that.

I am glad I saw this, but it was not a fun experience and I cannot say I enjoyed it.  It is really quite sobering.  Thank You...",1478736000,,1082,4.34

1392642,5,B000053SOF,"My uncle served in the 5th Army in these exact campaigns. He was shot twice on the way up the boot. His name was Dennis Pershing Stanley. He came home from the war and got a job working at a small post office as the post master. He would go to work, come home ,and except for work...he never left the house. He didn't leave the house at all after he retired ,until he died. He didn't talk to me hardly at all until I left home for 5 years during the Vietnam War. He would write me  letters 2-3 times a month. When I came home after the war he was my best friend. He still stayed at home. I noticed except going to work and his house...I didn't go anywhere. I didn't really feel safe.
  He told me the worst thing about Italy was Monte Cassini. There was a huge Cathedral structure on top of a mountain and the Germans could see for miles around. They slaughtered the Army guys for weeks from the top of the mountain. The local people loved the place and it had been around for several hundred years. It was the first  place my uncle got seriously wounded from a German sniper. Many of our allies got wounded including, British, Polish, and Gherka soldiers. The monastery was eventually bombed and rebuilt after the war. There were hard feelings about the destruction of the place ,but the fact that Italy had joined the Germans during WW2 didn't help the situation.
  One thing I found remarkable was the respect the average troops had for their commanding officer,Gen. Mark Clark. Until the day he died my uncle was ready to fight if anyone said anything bad about Gen. Clark, most of the enlisted guys were the same way from the guys from the 5th I was able to talk to. This was a great film. I would have wished they had added other battles to it..",1461542400,2,1751,4.290909090909091

1392657,5,B000053SOF,"""The Battle of San Pietro"" (1945) is a compelling documentary that places viewers in the line of fire.  Directed and narrated by John Huston, the 32-minute film remains a groundbreaking study on the humanism of war.  Like the best documentaries, it is a deeply affecting work. An examination of the U.S. foot soldier in combat, ""The Battle of San Pietro"" was filmed in December 1943 during some of the worst fighting of World  War II. The matter-of-fact poignancy of Huston's narration adds a sobering, ironic undercurrent.

During his career as a screenwriter and director, Huston excelled in his understanding of the human condition. Nowhere is this quality more evident than in the harrowing chronicle of San Pietro. Even today, much can be learned from Huston's intelligent exploration of the human spirit under fire. The film survives as a landmark documentary and a work of cinematic art.",1430956800,2,894,5.102739726027397
1392658,3,B000053SOF,"I would say that this is a very dry look at this event. It's a film made by the US government perspective, very cautious and for lack of a better word, just not interesting. The narration has the potential to put one to sleep. There is little detail and or explanation of what is occurring or a larger picture view. This movie reminded me of the ""History"" movies they showed us in 3rd grade. No interviews with soldiers, or battle tactics - maybe I missed that??
This is about the movie-not about the veterans and the heroes that fought this battle- they are all deserving of our thanks and gratitude, they deserve to be called the greatest generation. Its just that this movie was disappointing and they deserve a better narration of events than what was shown.",1428969600,,762,4.569343065693431

1392663,1,B000053SOF,"This film is NOT the real thing - please see Mark Harris' book Five Came Back, about five of Hollywood's top directors who went to war. Despite the claims made at the time, the battles in this ""documentary"" were entirely staged months after the battle was over, to be used as propaganda footage by the US military.
Huston nevertheless came up with compelling film making, but this work should be understood for what it is - a re-creation.",1420329600,3,438,4.628205128205129
1392664,5,B000053SOF,"I was surprised and struck by the brutal reality portrayed by this film.  Of course there are lots of scenes of happy civilians after the battle is finished, along with a ringing liberty bell, as you would expect for theater viewers in 1945.  But, before that, to see so much actual combat footage, with real advancing troops and real explosions, and real dead Americans.  I am used to the dramatic device of defeat followed by success, I was not expecting defeat followed by defeat followed by defeat followed by defeat in other words, the reality of the experience on the ground.  This was not a case of one side blundering and the other side taking advantage of it, both sides fought hard and smart and did not give up, they simply slugged it out until a key piece of terrain was finally taken and the Germans withdrew in good order.  I doubt we could produce a documentary of equal truth today.",1420156800,,898,4.552795031055901

They were often stymied by the internal politics of the various bureaucracies that oversaw their work, but occasionally managed to actually film combat - but not here.

With the exception of a few seconds of film, the entire thing is a restating of the battle with the cooperation of the US army, months after the fact. It was done in the actual ruins of the town of San Pietro.

1392673,3,B000053SOF,"I would choose to disagree that this is 'boring!' This Department of War presentation is well narrated and intended for public viewing. It does offer an overview that includes area maps. Considering the odds, the causalities sustained in Italy were higher than originally anticipated. The terrain gave an advantage to the Germans and they used it with lethal consequences. The documentary takes time to give a simple description of the people of San Pietro and the village history. Some of the original footage shows only the smiles but the burial details tell a different story. The close ups of US soldiers (living and dead) add dimension. The intent was to capture the reality of war and it does just that . . . the rest of this horror is left to the imagination.
