8536969,4,B0096SJJT0,"The DVDs are good (13 of them).
But packaging is cheap.
They try to squeeze 13 DVDs in a package that is too small.
Some DVDs might fall out when you open the DVD collection box.
I am thinking of buying a special package to keep these DVDs.

Other that that: the production is great, the story is good and the music is better!
Joe Arroyo's music is really outstanding. This story will tell you how he made his music and the circumstances behind his songs.
Highly recommended. It is so good, that I think, the DVDs deserve a better package where to keep them,",1368316800,,558,4.314285714285714

8536972,5,B0096SJJT0,Heard this for the first time around New Years 2011. Been a fan of the music and the show since. Excellent production by RCN. These songs are great to listen to. Good acting on the show by the entire cast and fantastic remake of Colombian Latin Music Icons.,1342310400,,257,4.375
