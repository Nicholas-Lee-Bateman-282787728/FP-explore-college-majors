8174980,5,B0008GRFQS,I got this DVD package for my history class because we were looking at American presidents. It helped out a lot and I was able to do a great term paper based on the films that are caputered here. Teddy Roosevelt was first a famous soldier and then became president after serviing with the rough riders. My teacher loved teh disks too and asked to borrow them next year for her class again.,1154044800,,389,4.342465753424658
