8484130,5,B005R5DTUQ,"David does a great job in all the videos I've seen him do, and this is no exception.  Very clear and carefully planned out.  This tutorial will literally get you on the fast track to recording great music with the R24.  Additionally, David explains important recording techniques and why they are so crucial in the recording process.  He explains everything in a step by step process that always keeps you focused on your goal.  I am a 40+ year song writer.  I am primarily interested in the music, not the technical capturing process, so when I get good instructions on the equipment I use to capture my creative moments, it makes me even more productive.  I highly recommend this tutorial regardless of your expertise in recording & engineering.",1465257600,,747,4.7890625
8484131,3,B005R5DTUQ,"Very helpful on some features, and as an overview.  It glosses over others and refers to an additional DVD package.  It's understandable that one lesson can't cover everything.  I wish the Zoom manual and this DVD would explain send-return at a beginner level, for example.",1454112000,,273,5.022222222222222
8484132,5,B005R5DTUQ,Well worth the $.,1451088000,,17,3.5
8484133,5,B005R5DTUQ,This is a wonderful asset.  It is a great help.,1447113600,,47,3.7
8484134,5,B005R5DTUQ,"This is a very well done video.  I spent way too much time trying to read through the manual and figure things out before I threw in the towel and bought this.  This was a great investment.  Everything is well structured and well presented.  Someone mentioned poor video quality - not true.  I watched it on a large 42"" screen and it was very clear.  Not HD, but perfectly clear.  If you watch it on a PC you might get poor results due to restrictions that your PC is imposing which is probably what happened to one reviewer.

There are a few sections in the DVD where he starts going faster then you can follow. So I wind up backing up and replaying it. But that's about the only negative aspect.

I had been using the R16 recorder for about 6 months prior to getting this DVD.  I wish I bought it earlier.  My recordings would have sounded better and I would have been more confident in playing with the features.",1438214400,,915,4.292397660818714
8484135,4,B005R5DTUQ,"It's very well made, and easy to understand. It definitely took me from zero knowledge to recording in a couple of days. The only complaint I have is that most, if not all, of the videos on the disk are on YouTube for free.",1437091200,,223,4.090909090909091
8484136,5,B005R5DTUQ,Very nice job - this is a great way to get started with the R24 from Zoom. This video was very high quality and well made. Very good camera work.,1384992000,,145,3.8666666666666667
8484137,5,B005R5DTUQ,"When I purchased my new ZOOM R24 Recorder, I just couldn't figure out the paperback manual, but when I decided to use the DVD Tutorial it was best and easiest tutorial that I have found. It was just like having a technician sitting right there next to me to show me what to do, and how to get the best recording result's. This DVD is ""Awesome"".",1383868800,,344,4.2272727272727275
8484138,2,B005R5DTUQ,Certainly not worth the asking price...Most of whats gone over on the DVD is already free on U-Tube...No manual is supplied with the DVD other than what comes with your R24 in the box...Really disappointed with it...The video quality also leaves one disappointed as well....Save your money...,1355356800,,292,5.23404255319149
