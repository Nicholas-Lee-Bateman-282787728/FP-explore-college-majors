2768841,4,B000NHVJSM,"Like a lot of silent movies, it suffers from problems of pacing and story telling. However, the set design and costuming? Especially for the Mars pieces? Brilliance. Sharp, jagged, plastic-and-metal brilliance.
This is a restored/cleaned version of the film.",1397174400,,258,5.641025641025641

2768843,4,B000NHVJSM,"MAIN PLOT POINTS--
The story opens at a radio monitoring station which receives a mysterious message from outer space. In a cubist-like Martian palace, Queen Aelita watches with fascination the alien activities of Earth. She sees the struggling masses and becomes fixated upon a scientist named Los who dreams of building an interplanetary spacecraft.

The Russian portion of this movie has a few subplots that weave loosely around the main issue of Los's suspicions of his wife Natasha's infidelities with an unctuous boarder. His seething anger compels Los to shoot his spouse. He then dons a disguise and builds the rocket (the interior of which looks like a boiler room-- we never do see the outside). Los lifts off for Mars along with a bored ex-cavalryman volunteer (Gusev) and a stowaway wannabe detective (Kravtsov), the movie's bumbling comic relief.

The three Earthlings land safely, and for Los and Aelita, it's love at first sight. While they dally, the amateur sleuth petitions for the seizure of Los, who is now Aelita's consort. There's a coup against Los and Aelita, who in an effort to save herself, exhorts the many Martian slaves to revolt. With chaos rampant, the military swears fealty to the queen, and she betrays the rebels by ordering the army to run them off.

In a deus ex machina twist, the entire Martian scenario was an invention of Los's vivid imagination-- the indecipherable space message is only an ad for a brand of tire. Los returns home to accept his fate but discovers the shots fired at Natasha missed her; the couple have a tearful reunion. The scientist burns his spaceship blueprints and vows to daydream no longer.

(6.5) Aelita: Queen of Mars (USSR-1924) - Yuliya Solntseva/Igor Ilyinsky/Nikolai Tsereteli/Vera Orlova/Valentina Kuindzhi/Pavel Pol/Konstantin Eggert

.
TECHNICAL NOTES--

The orthochromatic film used reproduces Kuindzhi's (Natasha) eyes as having no iris.

Aelita's head gear looks like a beat up roof TV antenna, and the Martian soldier uniforms, with their squared-off pasteboard helmets, are laughably quaint.

Print transfer is sharp, but occasionally jittery.",1221609600,2,2511,5.619047619047619
2768844,5,B000NHVJSM,"From the time when the USSR was a burgeoning Utopian state and the place still teemed with true believers we find an experiment so outrageous, so strange and  so honest that it must never be forgotten.  The filming is excellent and the effort in making this film must have been 200%.
This is the ultimate, unbelievable and perfect Socialist Fantasy ... if only it had worked.  In watching this, so many years after, I can't help but suspect that there is also a personal message hidden within which is now lost  but which stabbed at the heart of the author, director and producer.  Worth far more than the cost, but not something you'll watch every night.  This is a model for all which follows in the West as well as in the East.",1212105600,7,730,4.451127819548872
8177720,5,B000NHVJSM,"It is not easy to see a movie made by people who genuinely believe in what they are making under a different gestault.  The reviewers may have their own perception of the ""Facts"" that are quite different from what they saw in this movie. But I am not sure these ""facts"" are necessarily more realistic.  I believe a critical review of the raw evidences can get us closer to reality, and this movie is part of the raw evidences made at that time.  And it is a very good one in its own right.  When we point to others and claim that they are looking through filtered glasses we often forget that we are, alas, looking through filtered glass too.",1503964800,,642,4.325
8177721,3,B000NHVJSM,"Early 1920's Soviet silent film.  Tells the story of an engineer trying to develop a spaceship to Mars.  Besides this main story line there are side stories about a couple hanging on to capitalism who cheat rationing program and steal from others, another couple, a nurse and her wounded soldier, fall in love and marry, but he is bored with life away from the front, and finally a klutz of a Private Investigator who thinks he can outdo the official police effort, and who is always ""finding"" suspicious behavior.  The eventual trip to Mars is manned by the engineer, the solder, and the cop.  Even though this is a drama, there are several comedic scenes.

Of the Martians they look just like humans, but dress in an art deco fashion.  The title character, Aelita, is queen, but has limited power, and is controlled by a council.  A Martian scientist developed a distance viewer that allows them to view Earth events.  The council tries to outlaw use of the device but Aelita finagles the engineer to let her view Earth.  She sees our Russian engineer and his wife kissing and wants to find out what it feel like.  She kisses her scientist to find out.  But she is found out by the council and banned from the viewing room.

Back on Earth, our engineer begins to be jealous of his wife as she is being courted by another.  His suspicions eventually lead him to kill her.  He dons a disguise, retrieves his plans for the spaceship, and is followed by the PI.  The solders wife tries to stop him from going on the trip by taking all his clothes, but he dresses in her clothes and goes anyway.  Anyway this is why all three wind up going to Mars.

On Mars they are captured, Aelita has her kiss from the engineer, and soldier leads a revolt of the workers, supported by Aelita, and establishes the Soviet State of Mars. But Aelita had other motives, and as soon as the revolt is successful she has here troops fire on the workers, ending the revolution.  Our Russians escape back to Earth.

In the end we find that the trip to Mars was just a dream.

Interesting movie from a historical perspective in that it shows the chaos during the Russian civil war, and how food was in short supply, surprising amount of negative images of the Soviet system, but in the end the protagonists realize that the most important thing is to build a new and better society.",1486598400,,2355,4.496470588235294
8177722,3,B000NHVJSM,"I wanted to see this just for the Martian sets which I did very much enjoy. It was also interesting to see the level of female activity in professional environments post Russian Revolution. Aside from that though, I had to fast forward through ho-hum parts.",1469318400,,257,4.733333333333333
8177723,5,B000NHVJSM,"It was a very romantic time in the USSR. The civil war in Russia and wars with ex-colonies of the Russian Empire were finished successfully for Bolsheviks (excepting Poland and Finland), their terror subsided and a lot of people were thinking that the life will be better. The dreams about the World Revolution were still bright, and this movie is about that. But the future proved that the USSR and communism were civilization mistakes...",1468627200,,439,4.945945945945946
8177724,4,B000NHVJSM,"Interesting and entertaining film made just a few years after the Russian Revolution, as the country tries to rebuild and get back on it's feet, when radio signals arrive from an unknown source, similar to the much later film ""Contact"". An engineer is jealous of the attention his pretty wife receives, and shoots her. He attends her funeral in a disguise, then flees to the presumed source of the radio signals in a spacecraft he has constructed. He lands on Mars to find a puppet queen and a corrupt council of elders (representing Capitalism). A romance quickly blossoms between the engineer and the queen, and he helps her lead her people in overthrowing the elders. Yes, it's propaganda, but it is still as good as many other films from the era, although not nearly as good as Fritz Lang's ""Woman in the Moon"". The special effects are just ok, but the director pulled out ALL the stops for the sets and costumes on Mars, and probably set a standard of sorts for ""alien culture with their own technology"". Certainly the Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials made nearly 20 years later were still under the influence of this standard. The film combines a bit of social commentary, a bit of drama, a bit of adventure, a bit of romance and even a bit of comedy into a pleasant way to spend 80 or 90 minutes. For science fiction fans, this early work is a MUST see.",1462665600,,1364,4.548780487804878
8177725,4,B000NHVJSM,"This is a Soviet film made just after the revolution. The dialog was rendered by some one fluent in Russian and English. The storyline was interesting and very innovative, for it's time. The acting is typical for movies of this era. The way the historical aspect of soviet policies is portrayed,
it is clear that this film was intended as entertaining propaganda.",1444867200,,363,4.870967741935484
8177726,3,B000NHVJSM,"Part drama, part science fiction/fantasy, part propaganda film. A look at Soviet life in the aftermath of the October Revolution and the fantasy dreams world of one citizen, who seems to disconnect from reality occasionally and dream about mars. Not a bad film, the story seems to get a bit disconnected at times. Most of it takes place in Moscow, with the occasional view of Mars. I don't want to give away too much but mars is not the main gist of the film, although the set designs and costumes of the Martians were probably ahead of their time for 1924. If you are expecting a space/alien film this is not it. This is a Soviet silent film that is more about life in the 1920s. It is interesting (to me) if you want early futuristic stuff watch Fritz Lang's Metropolis instead.",1424304000,3,780,4.5
8177727,4,B000NHVJSM,just finished this flic i liked this alot  give it a try the costumes must have been something back in the 20s funny at times well try it,1417046400,,137,3.892857142857143
8177728,4,B000NHVJSM,"I was intrigued by the first few minutes of the film expecting an early Soviet SF film. It was not, in the classic sense, and so, was not what I was looking for. Nevertheless, I became interested as it progressed. Worth a viewing. Actually more than one viewing to appreciate it fully.",1413158400,,285,4.5
8177729,5,B000NHVJSM,Complexity of this deep dark film is beyond my meager means. Excuse me while I return to the government study of Duck Genitals.,1409616000,,127,4.565217391304348
