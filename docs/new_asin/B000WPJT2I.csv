2989205,5,B000WPJT2I,I'm buying all the volumes so that I can have them for my collection. I loved this show and I will always watch them.,1408924800,,117,3.9166666666666665
2989206,5,B000WPJT2I,"Super fun and clean humor.  Again, nostalgia for our earlier years. Clever way they slip in advertisements at beginning and end of show.",1395273600,2,136,4.913043478260869
2989207,3,B000WPJT2I,"This was an OK collection because it was mixed with the boys old and young...meaning it was not in sequence. I didn't think it was put together well enough where I'd buy any more. I bought a few all at once thinking they were arranged by season, and was disappointed that they were not. I was not familiar with this series as a child, and looked forward to watching the first episode through the last....sorry to say, I am not sure that I even saw the first episode! Also there was too much of the older boy (David?) and his married life to his wife - forgot her name - and found it rather hum-drum. I was more interested in the first seasons, simply because I wanted to see why it had become popular to begin with....I never figured out why.",1362182400,17,742,4.2695035460992905

2989210,5,B000WPJT2I,"These episodes of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet are as much fun and as timely now as they were in the 1950s when I was a child. Human nature doesn't change and the humor that accompanies family situations is funny from generation to generation. Clever dialogue, humor, and good clean fun for the whole family.",1331856000,19,315,4.642857142857143

8225100,1,B000WPJT2I,The program content is outstanding and very entertaining.  The disc is the problem.  The rendition is not what it should be.  The programs were on black and white film that should be a good source.  There no excuse for issuing programs on a DVD-R.  Disc 1 did not play as is often the case with DVD-Rs.  I ordered another that did play.,1522368000,,336,4.338709677419355

8225103,1,B000WPJT2I,My sister gave me this set for Christmas.  I have no problem with the content but the set had 2 vol 4 disks and no vol 2 disk.  Since it was a gift I do not know how to correct the problem.,1515542400,,189,3.4761904761904763
8225104,1,B000WPJT2I,"Orded this for a family member for Christmas. First set arrived with no Volume 2 DVD. Instead, Volume 4 was in the Volume 2 case.
Checked the Volume 4 case, and it also contained Volume 4. Thus, returned the set for a replacement. New set arrives with the Volume 3 case broken. And now no option for a replacement - refund only. You'd like to think that if you order something it would arrive in tact and accurate.
This was a gift that was loved as soon as it was opened. I would still like to get a replacement, but one without damage.

Please note - Volumes 6-11 was also purchase at the same time. 1 case arrived broken. Still awaiting replacement set.",1514592000,,655,4.32520325203252
8225105,5,B000WPJT2I,"So many of the episodes were so true to life. Why can't they make them like they use to? So much now is just trash.
