High alitude bomb runs very much in the Air corps minds at that time, of course your not going to see the nortan bomp site.very hush , hush for that era. I really don't think B-17s are going to make long bomb runs to Japan. But someone made a story of it and it was not that bad, but Hollywood.",1393632000,5,384,4.133333333333334
510501,5,6302756510,This was in excellent condition and was a full tape.  It has some great acting by great actors--and it is great in a colorized mode!,1384387200,,132,4.28
510502,5,6302756510,The remastered version of Bombardier was excellant.  I would reccomend it greatly to any movie fan.  The quickness of receiving it from the time of order to accuatly receiving it.  The condition of the DVD and the wrapper were outstanding.  I will be ordering more movies from Amazon in the future.,1363392000,4,298,4.784313725490196
510503,5,6302756510,Another older movie that does not disappoint  as it shows the spirit of the men who fought in defense of our country.,1355097600,4,117,4.318181818181818
510504,4,6302756510,DVD was as described and in good condition.  It was an interesting and entertaining movie and fitted well into the wartime genre.,1326585600,7,129,4.863636363636363
510505,3,6302756510,The story is about the starting of the bombardier school to tran bombardier on the new bom sight in the start of WW2. That the army air corp said would drop a Bom down a smok stack from 33000 feet up and at that time NO WON in the world had eney thing that came close Like all storys of that time they HAD to put in A LOVE of 2 men going for the same woman to add some spice to the story.,1325980800,,388,3.630952380952381
510506,5,6302756510,"This movie ""Bombardier"" was a very good movie.  It goes through the training of the first bombardier showing the hardships and the tough training.  The mishaps, the security and even some love.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes old movies and war time movies.  I was sure glad it came out on DVD.",1323734400,15,319,4.543859649122807
510507,4,6302756510,"This underrated war film was made in 1943, in the middle of World War II, and thus it has a wartime hyperpatriotism lacking in many of the WWII films made in the 1950's.  It follows a group of bombardier hopefuls through training and their first big mission in a B-17 squadron. The film was intended as propaganda- and is not exactly subtle in its portrayal of the Japanese villains. The film attempts to justify to the viewer ( by means of an entertaining story) the US Army Air Corps' strategy of high-altitude precision bombing ( as opposed to the more traditional ""dive"" bombing technique used by the enemy). This is done by creating a colorful cast of characters, each of whom have their own adventures, some fun, others harrowing. The two leads are Pat O'Brien ( the base commander who champions the new style of bombing) and his friend played Randolph Scott (a pilot who likes the old way but eventually accepts the new method). This film would probably appeal to WWII aviation buffs the most- as it shows the changing relationship between pilot and bombardier during this important air war. The training montages are fun, the tone is light and often funny-and there are stirring patriotic speeches and a good dramatic death scene at the ending. Plus a Bombardier theme song that the cast sings along to! I think this film was possibly intended as a recruitment film for the Army Air Corps, but i'm not sure. In any event, it is extremely enjoyable to watch. If you like old patriotic war movies, then you could do a lot worse- This is definitely my favorite WWII movie.",1021420800,26,1577,4.672661870503597

510600,5,6302756510,"I got this to learn more about what my uncle went through.  He was a bombardier in WW II in a B-24.  This movie tells about the training bombardiers received, how rigorous and dangerous it was and also about the fight within the Army Air Corps to make bombardiers officers.  My uncle was killed on a bombing run to Yap Island after leaving from Nazdeb New Guinea.  The movie is a bit dated, made during the war, but very enlightening.  The movie was filmed on one of the two actual training bases, so I saw the base and aircraft type he trained in.  It also followed the students into war in actual bombing runs.  It has some funny bits and also some romance, as it seems all Hollywood movies are required to have.",1438732800,4,714,4.323308270676692

510652,5,6302756510,"My dad was a bombardier in WW2 and he enjoyed this movie.  He said the training that is shown in the movie was exactly like the actual training.. the story gets a bit hokey in the last 3rd, but the first 2/3 is great!!  I recommend this movie highly!",1422057600,,250,4.081632653061225
510653,4,6302756510,"The film depicts a fictionalized account of the first WW2 bombardier school.  The first part involves training and mishaps with B-18s and AT-11s.  The last half hour is a very fictionalized account of a B-17E attack on Nagoya from a secret base, probably not to reveal any secrets of the Doolittle raid.

The demonstration match at the beginning of the movie with a Navy Vindicator dive bombing an anchored wood target and missing, followed by an early B-17 dropping one bomb directly on target, is an unrealistic comparison as the parameters involved should have led to equal accuracy, or opposite results, depending on the wind over target variable.",1420070400,2,651,5.0092592592592595

510656,5,6302756510,"This is an excellent movie about a little-known phase of WWII preparation; the training of bombardiers for the growing US bomber fleet.  Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott are outstanding in their portrayal of the Commander and lead pilot instructor.  Granted, you have to realize that the overall flavor of this movie reflects the war-mindedness of the American people during early part of WWII.  Overall, this was one of my favorite movies.",1414195200,,438,5.140845070422535

510658,5,6302756510,"I had seen this movie a long time ago and it stuck in my mind. The acting is tepid, the story plot is tepid, but the insight into the thinking of the time during WWII is, to me, very interesting and of value. Taking oneself out of the present day and inserting yourself into the mindset of our parents facing enemies devouring both Europe and Asia, and at war with the democracies, was a very scary proposition. This movie (warning: by present day standards is VERY ""corny"") provides yet another glimpse into that era for those interested. Like ""Top Gun,"" it was also a recruiting tool for those interested in becoming a prized member of military flight crews at the time: the bombardier. Lastly, movies during that milieu featured stars singing/dancing. You might cringe when you hear ""our heroes"" singing the ""Bombardier"" song but, as (again) ""corny"" as would strike modern day observers, the darn thing stuck with me over the years (again: recruiting tool from days gone by). Bombardier is a welcomed addition to my WWII video library. Bombs away .....",1404950400,3,1055,4.802197802197802
510659,5,6302756510,"Although this is one of the so called ""propaganda"" movies of WWII, I did enjoy it as a view of the WWII type ""culture"" regarding the war effort, etc., for the American public.  From what I have learned about this era, I believe that movies such as one helped to increase American morale at a very dark time in history, helping Americans to know they were doing what was right in fighting the terrible forces against them at the time.  I did enjoy this movie, although it is not up to the special effects of today; for the time period, I thought it was very well done.",1395619200,7,567,4.289719626168225

7831088,2,6302756510,"Typical Hollywood tripe. It has to follow the formula of at least one woman being wooed, a strong, unbending commanding officer, and several young but very idealistic men. The first statement by the Army Air Corp officer that the bombardiers won WWII with no help is ludicrous and is a ""truth"" held by most bomber high commands. It discounts the efforts and sacrifice of of the men on the ground who did not have the advantage of a warm bed, hot food, clean and dry clothes every day, and the encouragement of females at night.",1462233600,,527,4.557894736842106
