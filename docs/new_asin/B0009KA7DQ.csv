2297462,4,B0009KA7DQ,"I love my Poirot collection.  I actually brought all 12 seperate DVD packs and do not in the least feel ill used.  All my DVD's worked fine.  The picture transfer on these looked like someone did them in a garage on a bad day explaing why I gave these just 4 stars.  That said I would have brought them anyway because anytime I can spend with Mr. Hurcule Poirot, Miss Lemon and The Chief Inspector Japp in a bygone era is highly prized.  I enjoy watching as Poirot unmasks another vile criminal by sheer force of his little gray cells.  Finding out who done it in the company of one Hurcule Poirot is the time spent in ways most awesome since the scant quality invested in the DVD's do render them barely passable.

In defense of AMAZON.COM yes they do claim to have a 30 day return policy but when buy mega sets of DVD's customer service people can waive that allowing you to return them for a replacement that will work.  I buy Mega Sets of many things, LAW  & Order, Law & Order Special Victims Unit, Twilight Zone and so many others I can not mention them all.

At times I found to my horror well after 30 day return window had elapsed that some DVD's in a huge set were indeed ripe stinkers that did not work at all.  I reported the rotten DVD's to AMAZON.COM well after the 30 return period and my replacement DVD's were sent to me by 2nd day UPS.  You just have to explain your situation and ask nicely.  I buy lots of goods from AMAZON.COM and I can honestly say they have never ever not once screwed me over when some aspect of the deal beyond my control went bad.  If anything AMAZON.com bends over backwards to see its customers are never cheated or ill used.

You can't justly hold AMAZON.com to task for the fact some of these studios producing DVD's have quality control systems of brain dead mice.  AMAZON.com should be judged only on what they do to make things right when you do get bad DVD's and it has ALWAYS been my experience that AMAZON.com does whatever it must to make the customer whole.  AMAZON.COM even pays for return postage of damaged DVD's.  I am not paid being by AMAZON.com to say all this.  What I say herein is just the unvarnish truth of my experience after buying what must be close to 1000 DVD's and many other items from AMAZON.COM over the years.

Don't let some lobotomized studio nertz who LACKS THE LITTLE GRAY CELLS TO PROPERLY create a quality working DVD taint the good AMAZON.COM does in trying to keep your AMAZON.com buying experience pleasant.

Trust me I am no mouthpeice for AMAZON.com.  I do not like many things heck read some of my product reviews. When I hate something I have no problem saying exactly how vile merchandise is when those negative comments are in my mind well deserved.  My personal experience with Amazon.com coustomer care has always been great hence not deserving of harsh words.

2297465,5,B0009KA7DQ,"I love British TV Mysteries - especially Sherlock Holmes starring the very best Holmes ever - Jeremy Brett.  Class all the way! I never really watched Poirot before, but after I read the great reviews stating how it was the same quality as Granada TV's Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett, I purchased this set.  I was not disappointed - this too, is a class act!  Fantastic acting and wonderful sets.  Poirot is quite humorous at times and I love his classy, gentleman demeanor.  Very enjoyable and I love every episode.  The quality of the DVD episodes are superb.  The box holder for the DVD is very nice as well.  If you are looking for high quality acting, fantastic mysteries all put together in a classy way as only the British can do - then this is for you.  Don't even hesitate, it is worth every penny.  I would also highly recommend Jeremy Brett's ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""The Return of Sherlock Holmes"" box sets.

This set is a collection of all the individual DVD's sold by Acorn media. This is more economical than buying all 12 DVD's. The great thing about this collection is that there are no advertisements or interruptions. Just pure unadulterated Poirot....I love it...,1121558400,30,390,5.109375
2297468,5,B0009KA7DQ,"This stunning DVD box set collects all 36 one-hour episodes of the brilliant ""Poirot"" series, which had initially been released on DVD in 12 individual volumes containing three episodes each.

These episodes originally aired during what I call the ""Golden Age"" of PBS Mystery!, during Poirot's classic five-season run from 1989-1993. Amazingly and happily, the ultra stylish Poirot is still being produced intermittently, but in movie-length productions instead of one-hour shows.

Dame Agatha Christie, the widest read author in the world, created the immortal Hercule Poirot to universal acclaim. But for me, her most popular detective failed to generate an appropriate film pressence until this series.

Prior to that, actors who tackled the role in numerous movie adaptations were, to me, incredibly annoying, inexplicably choosing to highlight Poirot's many eccentricities while ignoring his heart. The result was disasterous, and for me, an insult to Christie's magnificent creation.

Amazingly, all of those long years of previous failures were wiped away in a single illuminating instant when actor David Suchet was cast as Poirot and immediately brought the Belgian sleuth to life in three-dimensional glory. To say that his portrayal is rich and utterly believable is to gloss over the accomplishment. Simple put, David Suchet is THE Hercule Poirot that I envisioned when I read those wonderful stories, ""n'est-ce pas? Oui!"" Suchet, a small man, is padded to give the appropriate girth to the detective, but in a deft way that appears true-to-life rather than laughable. (An unfortunate example of the latter occurred when Albert Finney played Poirot in a movie version of Murder on the Orient Express.)

Funny, human, dignified, well-mannered and respectful, Suchet's Poirot is a constant revelation, much like the gifted portrayal of Sherlock Holmes by the late Jeremy Bret, in yet another Golden Age PBS Mystery! triumph.

In addition to Mr. Suchet, the supporting cast in this series is equally brilliant, from Hugh Fraser's Capt. Arthur Hastings (Poirot's Watson), and Philip Jackson as Chief Inspector James Japp of Scottland Yard, to Pauline Moran's Miss Felicity Lemon (Poirot's secretary), all lovingly contributing to the production that remains the most-watched detective series in the long history of PBS Mystery!

In the 36 one-hour episodes included here, not only are the stories well produced and acted, the atmosphere of 1930's England, art deco and all, is also recreated in absorbing and believable detail. Beautiful English sea shores (even the Queen Mary, the jewel of the English fleet at the time, gets her due as Poirot and Hastings cross to America on her maiden voyage) as well as other countries, including Christie's beloved Egypt, also come vividly to life.

In addition to place, social classism, xenophobia and outright racisim are dealt with directly and indirectly, as many of those Poirot encounters mistrust him as that little foreigner. From theft, drug abuse, international intrigue and murder, every immaginable crime (as well as emotions from lust to greed to utter despair and suicide) come within Poirot's perview and are addressed with his usual aplumb and unique style and wit.

This remarkable set, at a great price, include the following episodes: &#65279;The Adventure of the Clapham Cook; Murder in the Mews; The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly; Four and Twenty Blackbirds; The Third Floor Flat; Triangle at Rhodes; Problem at Sea; The Incredible Theft; The King of Clubs; The Dream; The Veiled Lady; The Lost Mine; The Cornish Mystery; The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim; Double Sin; The Adventure of the Cheap Flat; The Kidnaped Prime Minister; The Adventure of the Western Star; The Million Dollar Bond Robbery; The Affair at the Victory Ball; Wasp's Nest; The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor; The Double Clue; The Mystery of the Spanish Chest; The Theft of the Royal Ruby; The Plymouth Express; The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge; The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb; The Underdog; The Yellow Iris; The Case of the Missing Will; The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman; The Chocolate Box; Dead Man's Mirror; and the Jewel Robbery at the Grand Metropolitan.

If you have never seen these, buy them. If you didn't want to shell out the cash to get each individual volume, then grab this collection while you can!!!",1115769600,369,4355,5.271284271284271

Agatha Christie's Poirot, The Classic Collection Vol. 1, starring David Suchet consists of 36 shows, each about 51 minutes long, plus Special Features. They are on 12 discs packed in a nice folder with hinged out disc holders; they were filmed in a 4:3 screen ratio.

These episodes were made in the ""golden years"" when Poirot lived and had his office in an attractive Art Deco apartment building, Whitehaven Mansions (Florin Court) overlooking Charterhouse Square Gardens, in London. His secretary was the charming Miss Lemon, his sidekick was the affable Captain Hastings, and his contact at Scotland Yard was the steadfast Chief Inspector Japp. During these years Poirot was brilliant, eloquent and serious. He always relied on his systematic approach ""order and method"". He could not tolerate murder and did not like it when people lied to him. Suchet mirrored his characteristics and personality perfectly during this period.

The thirty six very enjoyable movies in this Collection include among them murders, thefts, and international espionage.

My favorite murders, accidental deaths and suicides are:
o The Dream,
o Murder in the Mews,
o Four and Twenty Blackbirds,
o The Third Floor Flat,
o Triangle at Rhodes,
o Problem at Sea,
o The Affair at the Victory Ball,
o The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge,
o How Does Your Garden Grow?
o The Plymouth Express,
o The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor,
o Yellow Iris,
o The Chocolate Box,
o The Mystery of the Spanish Chest,
o The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb,

The thefts and similar crimes that I love to watch include:
o The Veiled Lady,
o The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim,
o Double Sin,
o The Adventure of the Western Star,
o The Lost Mine,
o The Million Dollar Bond Robbery,
o Wasp's Nest,
o The Double Clue,
o The Case of the Missing Will,
o The Jewel Robbery at the Grand Metropolitan,

The crimes involving International Espionage that I enjoyed very much were:
o The Incredible Theft,
o The Adventure of the Cheap Flat,
o The Kidnapped Prime Minister,
o The Theft of the Royal Ruby,

You simply must own both Volumes 1 and 2 of this collection if you want to have a complete collection of the films featuring Agatha Christie's famous detective Hercule Poirot. They are all very enjoyable; you and your family and friends will enjoy watching them and trying to solve the case before Poirot does over and over again.",1391212800,,2377,4.8399014778325125

Agatha Christie's Poirot, The Classic Collection Vol. 2, starring David Suchet consists of Nine Movie-Length shows, each about 103 minutes long, plus a special feature. These were filmed in the ""golden years"" when Poirot had an attractive apartment in the Art Deco Whitehaven Mansions (Florin Court) overlooking Charterhouse Square Gardens, in London. Miss Lemon was his secretary, Hastings was his sidekick, and Chief Inspector Japp was his friend in Scotland Yard. During these years Poirot was younger, intelligent even brilliant, eloquent and obviously upper class, serious and at the same time pleasant. His famous system was order and method. He did not like it when people lied to him and he could not tolerate murder. The Nine very enjoyable movies in this Collection include:

1. ""Peril at End House"", which is the story of a beautiful young lady who has inherited a large charming house perched on a hillside overlooking the sea. The house is in need of repair and although it is a valuable property there is very little income to pay for the required work. The young lady has a group of friends who often stay with her, dance and enjoy themselves. She also has an identical twin sister. There is a Murder and Poirot of course solves the mystery; but the identity of guilty party is shocking.
2. ""One, Two, Buckle My Shoe"", is the story of a banker in high places, his lady friend, and the dentist they both go to. This also happens to be Poirot's dentist. The guilty party was engaged in marginal activities during a former governmental position he held in India. Need I mention that there were several murders? When Poirot revealed the guilty party no one was more surprised.
3. ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" which was Poirot's first case in England. He again meets Captain Hastings, whom he had known in Belgium and who had just returned from the War. There was a death. It was originally diagnosed as natural but later it was identified as a poisoning which was not self inflicted.
4. ""Murder on the Links"" was another of Christie's earliest works, and one of her early Poirot's, published in 1923. The unusual twist in this story is that it was the repeat of an almost identical previous crime. There is a young love interest and of course the criminal is finally brought to justice and Poirot wins his bet with a German detective who gets to keep his pipe.
5. ""Hickory Dickory Dock"" is the tail of the extra curriculum activities in a student's hostel, which Miss Lemon's sister manages. There is a murder and the unexpected twist is that it triggers a confession in the prior case and puts the previous suspicion and charge of murder back in force.
6. ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". Can all of this be blamed on a cold winter and the malfunctioning of the radiators in Poirot's apartment? Now Poirot is confronted with a locked room in which a violent murder has been committed and a house full of guests including both family members and involved outsiders are suspects.
7. ""Dumb Witness"". Hastings takes Poirot to the country to witness an attempt to break the world speed record for motor boats. There is a mechanical mal-function and the contending boat bursts into flame. This is followed by harsh words, disinheritance, and a suspected murder. Poirot investigates but is led to the correct solution by Bob, a Fox Terrier of distinction, who points out to Poirot the reversing effects of a reflected image.
8. ""Death in the Clouds"" Tennis is a wonderful game, and one meets the prettiest friends watching it. Still if you have to travel between London and Paris to attend the matches you may eventually experience a murder in the air. Poirot can't avoid investigating since he was a passenger on the plane. He eventually identifies the guilty party, but the solution astonishes and greatly saddens an unexpected person.
9. ""The ABC Murders"" Such simplicity. Poirot is kept continuously informed as to the location of the next murder by the murderer. What could go wrong? Poirot got one step ahead and the totally unexpected murderer was identified.

This is really a wonderful set of Christie's mysteries presented as movies. All of the nine titles are winners; the character of Poirot is played to perfection in all of them, and they were all filmed during the ""golden years"".  If you have any interest in Agatha Christie's work you simply must have this collection of films in your collection of Great Movies.",1391126400,3,4447,4.832020997375328

So, I purchased these for her as a Christmas gift, and we end up watching them every time I go to visit her.  David Suchet has perfectly captured all of the foibles of Poirot - from his physical appearance to his mannerisms to his voice, he is just as the reader imagines Poirot to be.  With the addition of a strong regular cast of supporting players and tight writing and nice cinematography, each hour-long episode is like a perfect little morsel to savor when you're looking to lose yourself for an hour.

These are so well done that ownership make sense - even given that they're mysteries and you know how they'll turn out.  In every viewing I see something new and compelling - it's like a visit with an old friend.

My second purchase was the Agatha Christie Poirot: The Classic Collection which looks exactly like this collection except it is blue and white. This collection was my last purchase. It is awesome in my opinion. All 9 of these episodes are feature length and I have never seen any of them on PBS. Granted I just became interested in Hercule since January. Maybe these shows were on A&E or PBS many years ago. I have watched them all 2x now. Like i said in my last review, whenever I need to lay down due to my illness and cannot find anything on tv, I watch one of my Poirot DVDs. I even enjoy them after many times. Hercule Poirot is quality television. I watch more of his DVDs than I watch anything else. The Collection is interesting, entertaining and relaxing. Buy this one, the classic collection like it in blue and white and the Definitive Collection and you wll have 57 episodes. The last 8 episodes are on Amazon's movie collection 4, 5, & 6. Maybe they will make those into another DVD collection. David Suchet is my favorite poirot. There have been many Poirots but no one compares to him. I hope he makes more shows.

To date David Suchet has made 65 shows-some regualar and some feature length. Without buying so many DVDs I read a great review in Amazon telling me to buy the Agatha Christie Classic Collection. It has 36 shows on it. All are 50 minutes each, roughly. I want to have all of Hercule Poirot's shows in my collection. The best way to do this I have seen is by buying this colection and the Agatha Christie Poirot: The Classic Collection Vol. 2 which has 9 feature length movies and also buying The Definitive Collection which has 12 feature length shows. I know own 57 shows. So, if you want to have as many poirots as possilbe wihout buying each DVD this is the best way out of what you can buy now. I did the reseach on this so this is how I know. I made sure when I bought each collection that none of them had any duplicate shows on them. The last 8 shows are on The Movie Collections 4, 5, & 6. Maybe they will put these on a collection. Poirot is what I watch when I cannot find anything on television and even then most of the time I would rather watch a  Hercule poirot show I have seen before than watch anything on television. All these channels on cable televsion and nothing of quality to watch. I hope David makes more shows. I just love them. Another great website is the agatha christie website itself. Love Poirot and cannot get enough. Each DVD in this colletion has 3 shows so you don't have to change the DVD so much. I know others are not crazy about the packaging; however I think its fine.

If you liked them on first viewing and have not seen them again for years afterward (as is true of me) than these will provide the full delight of the originals. They are in excellent viewing and hearing shape; not a smidgen of incomprehensible accents to mar ones joy. Aside from the incomparable Suchet, the supporting casts are excellent, the direction all that one can hope for, and the scriptwriting generally superior. For newcomers, for younger viewers who may never have seen Poirot, I cannot guess as to their response. There is no violence besides the obvious need to provide a corpse, there is much talk and not much action. The pleasure is in the characters, the period scenery and costumes, and in the puzzle. The hero, Poirot, never lays violent hands on anyone, his sidekick in some of these, Hastings, former soldier that he was, never slaps anyone down for provoking his friend, the Scotland Yard Chief Inspector, doesn't even carry a gun. You will have to judge for yourself.

 David Suchet IS Poirot, although I have also enjoyed Peter Ustinov and Albert Finney as the Belgian detective. The acting, writing, and over all production values in the Classic Poirot series are first rate.

We have all of Christie's characters here: Poirot, Inspector Japp, Miss Lemon, and Captain Hastings and all bring a humor and richness to the telling of the stories. The glamour of the art deco age is well captured in the sets and costumes and the scripts stay faithful to the Agatha Christie stories.

I have also enjoyed some of the earlier feature length movies in the Poirot series such as The ABC Murders, Hickory Dickory Dock, Death in The Clouds, and Poirot's Christmas. Many of the later feature length movies are completely lacking in decent acting (except for Mr. Suchet)and the writing is dark, depressing and not faithful to Agatha Christie.

2297567,5,B0009KA7DQ,"Watching Poirot Mysteries is an acquired taste, but it's easy to acquire and there's a lot of them available. One of the better ways of doing it is with ""Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Classic Collection."" It's a nicely done boxed set of 36 episodes (about an hour each) on 12 CDs and will play for 30 1/2 hours, if you're so inclined. It's an attractive package, and I've had no trouble with it.

All of the Poirot episodes have certain things in common. They all seem to take place in elegant settings, for example. The culprits might be criminals, but they're high-class criminals. So, one of the things to do is to look around at the elegant surroundings. Everything seems to be done in the highest of taste and you can enjoy the paintings and the antiques, for example. Also everyone is dressed in an elegant fashion. There's none of the low-life criminal nastiness.

Secondly, the series of stories takes place in the 30s so everything within sight is adjusted to this time period and it's very hard to find anything that is out of place. A great dal of care has gone into filming these episodes. And speaking of the time, pay attention to the automobiles. They're all of the 20s and 30s and are magnificently restored. It seems that there are new and different cars with each episode. If you're interested in vintage British cars, this show is just awesome!

A typical Poirot episode introduces the subject in one way or another, and then starts dropping clues. Keep track of them. And, of course, some of them are there only to lead you astray. As the episode progresses it will boil down the cast, excluding Poirot, his sidekicks and secretary, to perhaps no more that six characters and Poirot starts weighing the clues and the characters and playing one off against another. Can you keep it all straight? Sometimes. Sometimes not. Toward the end of each episode, there is usually a gathering of suspects, Poirot and his two police sidekicks. Poirot goes over the clues and his conclusions. At that point, the culprit may break down and confess and the mystery is over.

Poirot is masterfully portrayed by David Suchet. He's a short, prissy little twerp that might be quite irritating and annoying in real life. He's always uncomfortably overdressed for any occasion and walks with a cane in one hand and the other hand is held behind his back. Stuffy? Oh, yes! But after a while, you might get over the annoying aspect of his portrayed personality and begin to find him amusing. At that point, you are a locked-in Poirot fan. Enjoy the series.

Can't say I've ever read an Agatha Christie novel. Can't say I ever will. You see I'm fearful after indulging myself in the excellence of the British TV Marple and Poirot series that I'll be somehow.... disappointed in the books (apologies to the undoubted genius of Ms Christie).

The Brits of course have developed a marked proficiency transferring to TV the period murder mystery genre; Sherlock Holmes, Cribb, Hannay, Marple and of course Poirot to name a few. The States also deserve some bouquets for Nero Wolfe.

Of course I'm also a sucker for quirky. I'm also partial to Morse and Munk. But ahhhh... Suchet's Poirot. That waddle (did he borrow it from De Vito's Penguin in Batman Returns), that immodest genius, those finicky foibles. This is a multi-dimensional character portrayal demanding repeat viewings just to satiate yourself with the charming individuality of a persona expertly expressed. Few actors have this kind of talent and if you have ever seen David Suchet in other roles you will understand this assessment.

Ah yes you are probably interested in the other elements of the series. Well, the support actors are proficient in their portrayals. Hugh Fraser does the bumbling but affable Dr Watson type Captain Hastings well for light relief. Philip Jackson portrays the competent but unimaginative Chief Inspector Japp well and Pauline Moran is enjoyable as the under-rated, methodical and quite resourseful Miss Moran. The sets are appropriate to the period and the story and scripts are well crafted.

But the difference between this series and the other excellent period murder mysteries available, is Suchet's portrayal of Poirot (no disrespect the leads of the other series who are all excellent). Suchet, in my opinion, is the best and though some critics may be disappointed with the translation of Ms Christie's books to the small screen, I doubt that even Agatha would have been disappointed by Suchet's portrayal of her famed detective.

For the interested, I also should point out another suggestion. Though the hour long episodes are excellent, the movie length versions of the series (I think there are about 13) are superior, despite the absence in many of them of his three companions.

Warning. This series is not for you action junkies waiting for a quick fix. This is not the mental chewing gum entertainment of a soapie. No belly laughs every few moments. Like others of its genre it requires your constant attention and sometimes multiple viewings to work out what has happened and why Poirot comes to the conclusions he does. But that's the fun of the genre....it keeps you guessing, keeps you interested. And you also often end up watching the idiosyncracies of the character interpreted by Suchet.

For me I give this series a 5 plus rating. For Suchet? A 6, only because I believe nobody does it better.",1217548800,,3064,5.3312629399585925

2297597,5,B0009KA7DQ,"Anyone, who doesn't believe Suchet is the quintessential Hercule Poirot, must be part of a significantly small minority!

This reviewer feels unable to accept, any other portrayal of the Belgium sleuth. It has been thus, since Suchet's first appearance on my TV screen. It is rare to find, one's much loved imagined fictional character, so accurately personified in an actor. Suchet is completely- and utterly - believeable, as Hercule Poirot.

Additionally, and very importantly, Suchet's acting is simply superb - as is the work of the main supporting cast as Chief Inspector Japp, Captain Hastings and, even, Miss Lemon.

It will be a long, long time, before any other actor attempts to portray Poirot - on stage or screen. It will be a long, long time, before anyone feels it a 'good business venture', to fund any other portrayal of Poirot. Suchet has made the character his own, and this is exstremely rare. It is, however, extremely complimentary to David Suchet.

If Agatha Christie's works please - or even if they don't, Suchet's Poirot will delight and please virtually everyone. An excellent series, indeed!",1214697600,12,1119,5.065217391304348

In this series, David Suchet brings Hercule Poirot to life, in just the way that we had imagined.  The other characters (Hastings, Japp, even Miss Lemon) are also well done.

This DVD set is a bargain, and works perfectly well in our TV + DVD-player setup.  Our entire family has enjoyed many hours of Poirot exercising ""the little grey cells"".  We have had no problems with the package or discs and have played them many, many times.

The only quibble we have is that sub-titles could have been added, it is hard to make out the accents at times.",1212624000,5,660,4.5508474576271185

What is incredible about this entire series is the attention to detail on costumes, settings and ensuring that the art-deco feel of parts of England can be recreated. I have always been a great fan of Agatha Christie and, in particular, the character of Hercule Poirot (I have found Miss Marple to be rather annoying). But David Suchet has resulted in a fan following for this character that has little to do with the original character. Each and every little flaw, trait, quirk, is played to great effect. This added to the already-flawless plots of Agatha Christie make this entire series a jewel in the crown.",1194652800,,703,4.818181818181818

Most of the others have only Japp or Hastings with one or two having both of them. Poirot is always good, but it's the four-actor ensemble that makes the mysteries great. By all means buy this collection. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect a complete compliment of lead characters in most of the stories.",1188086400,6,485,4.5227272727272725
2297633,5,B0009KA7DQ,"As a die-hard Agatha Christie fan, I've watched the Poirot and Miss Marple series for years.  David Suchet is absolutely terrific as Hercule Poirot.  He is superb as the impeccably dressed detective with the outrageous moustache.  He's also extremely believable as the Belgian with more than his share of grey cells.  His sidekick, Captain Hastings, and secretary, the efficient Miss Lemon, are just as I imagined from the books.

It's usually a difficult feat to transfer a book to film, but this crew deserves kudos for doing a wonderful job.  The mysteries are loyal to Christie's fully dimensional characters, red herrings, and tight plots.  The sets are sumptuous and I especially love the art deco look.  These are period pieces that are beautifully filmed.

The way this set is put together makes it easy to grab your favorite episode.  With 12 DVD's, and each episode listed on the DVD, it's a snap.  There's also an index on the back cover.

One word of warning:  A new company took controlling of Agatha Christie LTD and is now in charge of the Poirot and Miss Marple series.  If you REALLY want a series that is loyal in any way to Agatha Christie's characters, get the earlier sets before 2000.  The new Poirot and especially Miss Marple, are noticably different.",1187395200,5,1275,4.811059907834101
2297634,3,B0009KA7DQ,"The stories are good, the filmimg is good, the acting is good; the problem is David Suchet often speaks his lines in almost a whisper and there is no captioning.  Captioning would solve the problem.  The actor is British, an accent I have trouble with to begin, and then he is imitating a French Belgian accent speaking softly.  I have to turn up the volume so loud that if we had neighbors I'm sure they would complain.",1185667200,10,420,4.428571428571429
2297635,5,B0009KA7DQ,"Well, how does one muster enough praise so deserving of the writers, designers, producers and of course actors who undertook this incredible Poirot Mystery Series? I am a great fan of mystery, investigating a wide variety of works by different authors and actors alike, and I tell you that not one of the many other categories of mystery can rival this series in either film, or book form alike.

I grew up watching the immaculate Belgian sleuth solve even the most baffling of cases to perfection, all the while showing both style and humor, two prized attributes that seem to be sadly lacking in most detective shows these days. Ah, those were the good old days of Masterpiece Theater, and PBS Mystery!. Much time has gone by since, with the hollow and conspicuous absence of Poirot and his little grey cells, Ms. Lemon and Captain Hastings in that little London flat working along side of the man, and Cheif Inspector Japp woefully attempting to get to the scene first. All the little things that make up Poirot. Then one day that catchy, sophisticated saxaphone theme kept playing around in my head, and I decided to bring the greatest detective home in DVD form, but where to begin? Afterall, since the classic days of the first installments, many of Agatha Christie's other unfilmed Poirot stories have come to life in most recent years. Not to mention the variety of different ways in which the public can purchase these DVD's. It was so confusing at first, the different releases from A&E and the British, Acorn Media. I was lucky enough to run across a few reviews here on Amazon informing me that if possible, Acorn Media was the way to go, owing to the fact that A&E's American versions were the television edits having minutes ripped out for the purpose of commercial breaks. They we're right, and so I ventured to buy all of the 'classic' episodes on Acorn Media in one fell swoop. I ordered this set, ""The Classic Collection"" from here on Amazon and have to say that I am fully and completely pleased. Over 30 hours of pure perfection situated on 12 discs. The transfer of these episodes is fantastic, with bonus features including filmographies of the major cast as well as those of the lesser known stars in each individual episode! And the most important thing is that the mysteries are in their entirety. I can't tell you how much joy I've had from this set, packaged neatly inside it's well designed box. I pop one in late at night, or sometimes when I'm having lunch-they're just the right length, each being a little less than an hour long. Among my favorites are:

""How Does You're Garden Grow""
""Wasp's Nest""
""The Theft of the Royal Ruby""
""Yellow Iris""
""The Third Floor Flat""
""The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman""
""The Dream""

I would list the names of all the episodes for your convenience, but that, conveniently, has been done by several of my predecessors already.

Speaking as one who has just bought his first Poirot set, I must say that this is absolutely the way to go for beginners. I'm hoping to add soon to my collection, some of the many other Poirot mysteries. After researching it, I think the next best purchase would be ""The Classic Collection Vol. 2"" from Acorn Media, which includes some of the feature length films such as the famous ""A.B.C. Murders"", and ""Hickory Dickory Dock"" as well as the very first Poirot mystery, ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" where Hastings and Japp are first introduced.

As much as I wish to stick to my rigid plan of not purchasing any of the A&E sets, I'm afraid that it is impossible from this point if I intend to buy any of the newly filmed episodes. Apparently A&E holds the rights to every new mystery henceforth, so until Acorn Media decides to release a new set containing these, A&E is the only way to go. The A&E ""Complete Collection"" contains four more movie length mysteries including a favorite of mine, ""The Murder Of Roger Ackroyd"". The ""Classic Crimes Collection"" and ""New Mysteries Collection"" are both from A&E and offer more regular and movie length mysteries as currently unavailable anywhere else.

So there you have it. A quick rundown of my research of all that is available for the best purchases of the Poirot series. I encourage you to buy the larger sets rather than individual DVDs of only three episodes at a time. The price works out much better in the long run.

And one more thing. Be careful when removing the DVDs from their slots if you purchase any of these sets. There is a little excrement of plastic that sticks out on the CD shelves, just a manufacturing defect that could damage your discs if you swirl them around too much.

This is the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon.

I strongly advise customers of both the Classic Collection Vols 1 & 2 to relocate their discs from the existing jewel sleeves to a safer album, tho. I've noticed on both of the jewel case sets there is a raw nub right on each sleeve that will SCRATCH and SCORE your DVDs if the dvds are ever rotated or moved upon this surface.

2297649,5,B0009KA7DQ,"When Acorn released the first ""classic collection"", people liked me rushed in.  This megaset contained all 12 discs representing the hour long episodes at a price well below the price of them individually.  The 2 hour episodes had been previously released separately and in 2 box sets called ""movie collections"" (the first of which also was reissued on a special limited promotion with 6 discs during Christmas just prior to release of the second), both of which I bought.  So it stands to reason that for people like me who bought the first megaset, that Acorn would eventually release another combining the 9 2 hour episodes in 1 set, so you can safely say you have all 21 discs in 2 sets to take up less shelf space.  I'll tell you the truth folks, I agree with that philosophy, whole heartedly.  But seeing at present that the only thing added that wasn't in the 2 original box sets (I don't count the fore mentioned special copy of movie collection 1 as a separate set) is the Agatha Christie's Garden, I see no need to rebuy this set for me, but if you haven't bought the 2 hour ones yet, then by all means do so, because the price IS better than what the 2 older sets sold for combined new.  Make sure you remember one thing.  These are the 2 hour episodes that aired on London Weekend Television and PBS' Mystery like the hour long ones in the other megaset of this color and shape, and are not the A&E ones made since 2001.  Those are still available on the A&E label.  I would not be surprised if Acorn eventually combines their 2 megasets into 1 of all their episodes and A&E does the same, particularly since in their last 2 sets of 4, you could only buy 1 of the 4 as a separate item.  Funny thing, I said roughly the same thing when A&E combined all of Danger Man/Secret Agent (half hour and hour alike) into 1 megaset. ;-).  Still and all a great deal for the mystery buff.  As another fan of this series who thanks to Amazon, I communicate with at least once a week would say, if you have a few of these already, complete your collection the least expensive way possible, if you have none of them, order this set.",1177718400,58,2129,4.348484848484849

The box itself, the package and everything looks really nice, and the DVD menus are nicely done too, but when the actual film episodes begin, you notice how bad the picture quality is. It came as a shock to me, because I'd just bought and watched another English TV series on DVD; Granada's Sherlock Holmes (The Complete Collection), which is probably the greatest purchase I've made. All the Sherlock Holmes episodes had been re-mastered (or re-transfered, or whatever the correct term is). The first season of Granada's Sherlock Holmes was filmed in the early 80s, and yet when I watch those episodes now, they look so bright and clean and crystal clear, like they were shot in 2005. They've done an amazing job with this release, and so I was expecting something similar here, with Agatha Christie's Hercule Porit, this also being an English TV production. But these Poirot episodes look real bad. Which is a shame, because the writing's good, and the acting is good. Directing and producing is good. Can't believe they failed so miserably in transfering the tapes to DVD. Also, this release lacks subtitles. That's a big minus. They didn't even include English subtitles. These things ruin the overall impression for me, I'm afraid. To end on a less negative note, I can say that one very pleasant surprise regarding this release was hearing the theme music again, after all these years.",1128816000,159,1442,4.913934426229508

In addition to the dramatic ups and downs, the creators of the show managed to make a humorous tone.
