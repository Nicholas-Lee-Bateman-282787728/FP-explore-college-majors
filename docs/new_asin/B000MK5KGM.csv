8278199,5,B000MK5KGM,"This is a little known (for me) movie of Rod Taylor's. I bought it not expecting too much as far as plot or music themes, etc...just wanted to see Rod. Well, it more than met my expectations. While I have heard others, including the woman who runs Rod's fan site, don't like the 80's soundtrack, I loved the music!! I thought it was really good and the words to the music were intricate in the plot. Its a caper film and it holds up in my opinion. Rod is his usual rugged and handsome leading man. The only mis-step in my opinion is having him fall in love with a 18 year old girl. However, I enjoyed the film and recommend that Rod's fans check it out if they have not before.",1322265600,,677,4.136363636363637
