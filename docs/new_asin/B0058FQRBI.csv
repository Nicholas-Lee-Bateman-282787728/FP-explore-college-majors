4598271,5,B0058FQRBI,"Very well made documentry, love watching it and learning from a pure master fabricator. Great to see Jesse James making these types of dvds, because it shows that people can learn a craft like this and still make a decent income from it and be happy making and design cars or motorcycles.

Would recomend this dvd and it will not disappoint.

Had this dvd sent to Australia and it arrived in excellent time and in very good order. Thanks Amazon.",1313798400,4,445,4.55

8461522,5,B0058FQRBI,Jesses frenzied approach to the psychedelic railbird loop de loop laid to the natural bone  chopfest inspires and fires up the cranial pistons leading to a supergroovy hour of hog heaven in freakin scootsville man. This hard cat damn near blew my wig back with his hellraisin tales of motorcycle debauchery and civilian scoot elitism. In a perfect world Sandra would still be hanging in an overbite liplock from Jesses well-hickeyed neck. The visuals were i kid you not a Fellini-esque surreal fondue somersalt freak off. Fabricate me a new soul Mr. James purdy pronto. if this is outlaw heaven sign me up daddy-o..,1424044800,,615,4.913461538461538
