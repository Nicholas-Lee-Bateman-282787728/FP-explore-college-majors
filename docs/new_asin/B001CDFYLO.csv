8287014,5,B001CDFYLO,Bought this for my step son for Christmas because he is needing help with building character and he loves anything cars since both his daddy and step dad are mechanics. So I'm excited that he's going to be learning while watching something he loves. The shipping was fast on our order I received them earlier then expected now I can't wait for him to open them so we can watch them.,1450310400,,382,4.394366197183099
8287015,1,B001CDFYLO,"I just watched this show on TBN. I had to explain all of the false teachings to my five year old so she woudn't be confused. The basic story is that the taxi believes in the tire fairy and others do not. She sings that she wants to believe but needs to know for sure. Then she concludes that her friends who believe are happier, so she will believe. Another character hears her and says, ""that makes sense."" At the end the ""lesson"" is that the fairy is real if you believe in the fairy and do good.

This is teaching kids two things:
1) We should believe in things because believing makes us happy, and
2) Believing makes it true for you.

THAT IS UTTER NONSENSE!!! Protect your kids from this foolishness, especially if you are a Christian. The Christian faith is based on historical fact, not wishful thinking.",1325462400,2,812,4.406666666666666
