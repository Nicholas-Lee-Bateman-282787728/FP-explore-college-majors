She starts with telling you how different foods have different properties like garlic, ginger, onions are warming while fruits, cucumbers, green foods are cooling. Most of us realize that subconsciously when our bodies feel cooler or warmer after eating those things. She goes more into that & into also bitter, sour, sweet, salty.
She also goes into the different teas & what they help with: white, green, red & black. She goes into herbs found in many Asian markets or health food stores. She points out the names of the teas, herbs & even certain powered/pill forms for complaints such as nervous headaches, digestion problems, heart & cholesterol. She recommends looking at your tongue to know what's going on with your organs which is a great tool for self diagnosis along with other symptoms.
Her ease of knowledge of herbs & how they help specific ailments, her accent when saying the herbs Asian names flawless, and her modestly to allow the store owners to talk & tell of herbs they recommend impressive.
Last is a single Qi Gong exercise that starts with an exhale as you swing the arms down & behind you w/bent knees & then inhale as pull up over your head, holding the breath, pull the energy down to the chest, exhale as you swing the arms down & up & down circularly like a volcano. She did this very well with great intention, I enjoyed it & wished there was more.

This lively video captures the colorful markets in Chinatown so  vividly that one can almost smell the fragrance of lemon grass and ginger.  Her simple explanations to a balanced health are a wonderful example of her  profound knowledge on this complex subject. It takes a truly gifted person  to demystify the Asian health secrets and translate them into an easily  understandable language.
 Another great thing that came to me from  this video was the Chi Gong breathing exercise for health and vitality. I  have tried it and it really works.
 Anyone interested in what the  Chinese wisdom has to offer to the Western world will find this to be a  required video in their library.
