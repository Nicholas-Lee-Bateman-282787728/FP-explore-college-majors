7168086,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"Great Documentary! I think millennials, such as myself, should really watch this film as there are a lot of alarming facts that I'm sad to say I had no idea about and it really shows how yellow journalism preformed by major news stations and random dubious articles or information on the internet can be misleading if you don't put in the proper research. I hope to see more recognition and public awareness of this film soon.",1436400000,3,426,4.618421052631579

7168089,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"This is the followup film to the documentary ""Food Inc"" and is another ""call to action"" film -in a similar vein to Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"". But, unlike AIT there is no one person giving a lecture.

Director Robert Kenner draws you in immediately with ""magic"". Yes, here is an illusionist doing card trick and showing how deception can make you think you are seeing one thing, when it's really something else. The clever photography starts to draw you in. Then he uses archival news footage and vintage commercials to discuss how the tobacco firms hired ""scientists"" to tell the world that tobacco was not dangerous to our health. He moves on briefly to the furniture makers who used similar tactic re: fire-retardant chemical that were dangerous. Now that Kenner has drawn you in, he moves to the main topic - Global Warming. He actually allows both sides of the argument to have their say. But, as you will see - as I did - the ""commentators"" - nearly all right wing republicans - embarrass themselves on camera. But this is not an anti-republican film. You'll even learn that there is a wing of the Tea Party that supports efforts to stop this ""killing of our planet for future generations"". And here is former Secretary of State George Schultz saying that the pollution is dangerous.

I'll let you read other reviews of the film to get other perspectives and concentrate on the BD and DVD releases (I was provided with a BD for an objective review).

The film itself runs 96 minutes. In addition, there is a full-length commentary by director Kenner. (I have not listened to that yet). There is a 17 minute ""Q&A"" with Kenner at the Toronto International Film Festival screening. He is a personable interviewee and talks about what he learned from making ""Food Inc."" that he used here. There is also a 5 minute compilation of interview clips (not in the film), titled ""Unlikely Voices"", that include the aforementioned Schultz and the Atlanta Tea Part rep,.

Honestly, I think this BD/DVD will be seen more by those who care about the environment - and make them even madder than they are now - but if even a handful of folks are driven to contact their representatives in their state or federal offices, the film will have served a purpose.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7168090,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"This is a must see film that joins the ranks of The Cove and Food Inc.  It organizes the facts and backs them up with great archival footage.  Seeing the actual ""Playbook"" used by Big Tobacco on how to deal with science, the public, congress and others who would impede upon their profitable killing scheme was an eyeopener.  And the piece about how Big Tobacco was responsible for the addition of all the harmful chemicals into our mattresses and furniture because cigarettes weren't responsible for fires - the furniture was - wow! Then onto global warming and how ""the Playbook"" is used to cast doubt on this subject so big oil can hold out as long as possible.  All very well documented with great interviews.

7168091,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"I have used the book on which the film is based several times in undergraduate and MBA courses in environmental law and ethics (undergrad) and my MBA course in Law & Ethics. It is well researched and reliable, and consistent with other books and the original peer reviewed articles that Naomi Oreskes wrote on the climate science consensus, which is even stronger today. I am preordering the film for future uses and think it will be well received. Obviously a film cannot by itself contain all the contents and footnotes one finds in the book, but check out their web site: http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/  and other sites such as http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/  This is too important a topic to permit the fossil fuel paid skeptics to continue to mislead the public and provide cover for failure to act in a timely manner. Ironic, too, since two denialist Presidential candidates are from Florida, which faces series challenges from inevitable sea level rise due to climate change.

7168092,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"I watched this last night, and it is very, very good. The movie departs from the book in that it presents interviews with the movers and shakers on both sides of the debate. The thing that struck me was the varying attitudes of the deniers. Some, like Fred Singer, appear completely sincere in their beliefs. To others, like Marc Moreno, it is all just a game, and Moreno gleefully describes sending anonymous death threats to climate scientists.

The movie was more restrained and balanced than I had expected. For the most part, it doesn't attack the deniers but lets them speak for themselves. The deniers convict themselves with their own words.",1433894400,40,649,4.846846846846847
7168093,2,B00XIXGQ6S,"The movie is very slick propaganda, that itself accuses Global Warming skeptics, of very slick Propaganda. Whom should we believe? Full disclosure: I am a fairly objective person in the science business myself; perhaps you'd call me a ""Lukewarmist"", who can see that the earth has been warming in modern times, just not nearly as catastrophically as the AGW True Believers think it is.

The movie makes these assertions: (1) The science behind Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) is SETTLED. No disputes. No interpretations. No doubt. As the fanatical James Hansen says, ""we understand the Earth's climate system as well as medicine understands the human body."" -- Is this really true or just a wild, exaggerated assertion?  I tend to believe the latter.  (2) The science being ""settled"", all skeptics of AGW are unscientific shysters, liars, and con-men who are funded by BIG ENERGY (ie fossil fuel companies). Of course, the movie doesn't interview any intrepid and principled scientists who are AGW skeptics and not in the ""Warmest True Believers"" tribe. (3) The public MUST recognize that the AGW skeptics, like tobacco supporters, being all shysters and con-men, must be shouted down by the mob, so that we (the US I guess, although we only put out 14% of the worlds CO2) can institute big government regulations and save the planet. In other words, shut off all scientific dissent or independent thought, and plunge the US into a Big Government Agenda to destroy our fossil-fuel-based economy.

The movie makes the octagenarian Dr. Fred Singer a ""bad guy"" because he's a dissenter. He obviously is unobjective, just like those pro-smoking scientists who sold their souls! As a matter of fact, the movie takes the ""Scientists who sell their souls"" idea from tobacco and the flame-retardant industry, and smears all scientists with it, who dare to dissent from the ""Liberal Scientific Consensus Good Guys"". They MUST be selling their souls because they disagree with the dominant liberal majority! Actually Dr. Singer tries to make a case for his ideas, but of course he gets tarnished in this movie (Villian! He's not in the Politically Correct TRIBE! All those in the wrong tribe are evil!) And while we're on consensus/dissent: about that mythical 97% consensus number: The American Meteorological Society did their survey and they asked, ""Is man the dominate controller of climate over the last 50 years?"" Only 52 percent said yes. SO, the 97% number is totally false. For this movie to repeat it or to say ""the science is settled"" demonstrates again that this movie is simply propaganda.

The move has some ""heroes"" (Guys who are in the GOOD TRIBE!). A Republican Congressman who learned about CO2 and the warming trends and who got canned from his conservative, flag-waving district. Poor guy, being kicked out of office by the rubes who don't want their economy to be destroyed! Another hero: Dr. James Hansen, a guy who ridiculously predicted in 1988 that Manhattan would be underwater by now, who published a warming model in 1988 that overstated the temperature rise nearly 3X over what it was -- he's the wonderful HERO, the intrepid, OBJECTIVE scientist. Actually I believe that Dr. Hansen, due to his self-righteousness and a personality flaw that leads him to grossly exaggerate the warming trends, long ago ceased to be an objective scientist. But he is nearly canonized in this movie as a saint and a prophet.

Overall, very slick propaganda that is designed to slander all AGW skeptics or level-headed contrarians, and make us all stop doubting and stop looking at the actual data, and stop using coal or oil, and go rushing out to destroy our economy and do other risky, panicked actions, because we want to be in the GOOD TRIBE. The antithesis of science.

I only give it a second star because, being propaganda, it's well-made propaganda.

I have one last question: why does the Left have to always overstate its case so ridiculously? We can see that the earth is slowly warming and can prepare for that, and maybe even do something about it, without destroying our economy for no reason. Why do people on the Left have to jump to hysteria (""Manhattan will be permanently underwater"") or character assassination (""AGW skeptics are just like the pro-tobacco shills"") in order to make their case? Why do they have narcissistic messianic complexes, like Dr. Hansen, which they use to justify disregarding or wildly exaggerating the facts in order to irresponsibly scare people?",1433808000,19,4497,5.010709504685408

7168102,4,B00XIXGQ6S,"Memorable quote of the film: ""Doubt is our product""
Really terrific documentary. Watched for a grad school class I'm taking on Green Politics and public policy. Was interesting that they started off with past examples of this type of organized deception campaign (essentially), smoking being the big one. It's remarkable that they were able to get interviews with the guys (noticed there were no women) who are hired by the companies to argue the ""climate denier"" side; one of them just had absolutely no compunction about what he's done and continues to do, whether it's giving completely misleading information or posting the email addresses of scientists who are then harassed. Both eye-opening and quite depressing, honestly.

I like that we're shown how this campaign has really been so well orchestrated and the planning and careful strategy that goes into it. For example, as people come to believe in climate change more and more, the denial side evolves from outright denial, to then saying it's not bad, then that it's not manmade, etc. So that they're always pushing the envelope enough that they need to, but not so far that people will be able to easily dismiss them. Because as the scientists (and the fake experts) say, the science behind all of this is complicated and hearing the details can be very dry; the one-liners that deniers give are much easier to hang on to and make for much better TV.

Don't think most people realize how little disagreement there is in the scientific community about climate changemeaning, basically none. But when there are segments on television, they always have one person from each ""side,"" even though one of them is representing 99% of the scientific community and the other is only representing the remaining 1% (or less, whatever it is). To a viewer though, it makes it seem like this is a controversial issue, hotly debated in the scientific community ... and it's not!

Look forward to reading the book as well. Books are always able to go more in depth and so while I enjoyed the documentary a great deal, I'm hoping we get more insight into the companies, maybe off-the-record interviews or something. I also still don't completely get the motivation for the used-to-be reputable scientists who argue the denier side; there is an explanation given about how in the end, to them it comes down to being against socialism, and giving into the environmental side means more regulation, less free market, and that's what they want to avoid above all. ... But if they are able to realize the situation, do they not realize that it doesn't really matter if the US is socialist or not if in 100 years most of humanity is dead? It's easy to understand the motivation of the companies ($) and of the fake experts ($), but that's not the driver for the handful of people who are actually grounded in reality yet on that side of things.",1487030400,3,2883,4.808467741935484

7168104,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"Nice film. Very watchable.  I randomly found this film at the library. It's mostly about that deception of the smoking industry and global warming. Lots of people getting paid to deny facts or just plain ignorant. The film shows that most of the people you see on TV claiming to be experts are just paid phonies with no knowledge and their only purpose is to spin facts. The film has a small amount about flame retardant toxins put into furniture and bedding by the pound. I would have liked to hear more about the toxins. The film says that many firefighters have gotten cancer because of the toxins from flame retardant in furniture and bedding from fighting fires. I've always found it very odd that men and politicians can't get along and continue to sell lies for their profit and future generations peril. Most of these politicians act like kids and just seems so idiotic. If young people can work together and get along perfectly fine then I don't see why people in their thirties, forties, fifties sixties, seventies could not get along. Very idiodic. The film reminds me of a recent story on our local NBC news station about the Fukushima disaster and nuclear radiation in the Pacific Ocean. The story said that some fish may have a small amount of radiation but it is still perfectly fine to eat it and it should not affect you because scientists said the level of radiation was so low that it would not harm you. I knew this to be a lie.  I later heard Thom Hartmann discuss this deception on his radio program. No level of radiation is good for you. I recommend Merchants of Doubt if you like documentaries. Ask your local library to order a copy if you want to see it. Another good documentary  film to see is The Best Democracy Money Can Buy: A Tale of Billionaires and Ballot Bandits by Greg Palast if you like interesting and offbeat stuff.",1484265600,,1856,4.550898203592815

7168108,1,B00XIXGQ6S,"That the climate debate has been sullied by the involvement of the fossil fuel industry is unfortunate. Naturally they don't want any restrictions. None of this should matter to the basic science.

Merchants of Doubt asserts that we've been tricked by the likes of conservative think tanks, who are opposed to government interventions, and the interests of the fossil fuel industry. I have no doubt that these groups are opposed to AGW on grounds other than the science. But there are scientists who disagree with the majority opinion. The film insinuates that there are fictitious names on the opposing ""Oregon Petition,"" such as Dr. Charles Darwin and Michael J. Fox, but it doesn't go on to track down those signatories and prove this: it could very well be that we do have a contemporary Dr. Charles Darwin, for example.

But more than this, the film isn't about the science: it's about the supposed conspiracy against the science. We're told that the Climategate emails have been looked into ---""nothing much."" Many would disagree with this and would argue that the Climategate emails reveal a close-knit group of scientists who are all-too-willing to attack the messenger rather than the arguments-- and this flaw is at the heart of the film as well. It consistently attacks the messengers of doubt, and not the reasons for that doubt.

What are the reasons for doubt? The film says nothing at all about the notorious hockey stick-- the graph produced by Michael Mann et al that showed 1998 as the warmest year in the last 1000 years. There's a good reason the film doesn't mention this: it's been thoroughly debunked. Here's the ""trick"" that Merchants of Doubt is playing on you: they are telling you that the science is settled, but they aren't telling you that in 2001 in the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC Mann's hockey stick played a central role, and that this graph was used to convince governments around the world that the planet was heating up faster now than in the past 1000 years, while in fact at that time there was contrary evidence showing a medieval period warmer than today, and this issue is still ""unsettled."" The 1990 IPCC Report also showed a medieval period warmer than today, and the Climategate emails tell us of the efforts to get rid of the medieval warm period-- notice they aren't looking for objective facts but they have an agenda, just as they did when Mann's hockey stick took central place despite contrary evidence and, more importantly,  despite that the graph was never checked for accuracy. It turns out that there's no statistical basis for this graph: it should never have been used, and the story can be found by searching for ""What is the hockey stick debate about?"" by McKitrick. This is shoddy science at work; this is cherry picking evidence to suit the theory.

We hear about climate change and sea level rise and storms, but none of this is proof that CO2 is the cause. A study, ""US Temperatures and Climate Factors since 1895"" by D'Aleo has shown that natural weather patterns are more significant than CO2 and better explain the current climate.

Look at James Hansen's predictions about climate catastrophe: he's been largely wrong all along.

I believe we need to use fewer fossil fuels, and we need alternative energy. I don't agree with much of what the conservatives say but they are right that we should beware of an over-reaching government. CO2 is a greenhouse gas but maybe most people don't understand that most of the projected increase in temperature has to do with knock-on effects of an even more potent greenhouse gas: water vapor. Clouds. There are many variables involved so we don't know for sure if increased water vapor will cool or heat. What we really need to do now is look closely at the science and at the methods and activities of the IPCC; since so much is at stake, we need to make sure that the IPCC is correct and the science is correct. We need a rigorous audit of the IPCC, something that has never been done despite common belief that it's all rigorously peer reviewed. Here is an appropriate comment (in light of the film's analogies to card tricks) on the IPCC's workings by Ross McKitrick in ""What is Wrong with the IPCC"": ""Simple card tricks often work by adding in steps that seem to make the  outcome impossible, but which in reality have no effect. For example, if the card that needs to be revealed is known to be at the top of the deck, it is a simple matter to shuffle the deck repeatedly without changing the position of the top card. While it looks like the entire deck has been randomized, in reality the shuffle was neutralized with respect to the one card that matters. Drawing attention to the number and speed of shuffles adds to the effect, but is irrelevant. The analogy applies to the IPCC review process. At some stages the review process is open, rigorous and transparent, taking in a wide range of views. But there is a subsequent re-write under the control of a small group of Lead Authors that is not open and not subject to review.""

The main argument against the greenhouse effect is that the IPCC science and projections have been biased, and there's good evidence for that. So are we getting the real story? The situation may be serious, but to me the more serious question is this: are we auditing the science as carefully as we should be? Let's do this first.

So see the movie, but with your eyes open.",1473379200,2,5428,4.698212407991588

7168111,2,B00XIXGQ6S,"For a historian of science studying climate, Naomi Oreskes has a very limited view of climate skeptics and so does this movie. It presents a few think tanks as creating doubt about the science of global warming. It claims this is equivalent to tactics that were used by tobacco companies. It does have some damning evidence against tobacco advocates, but the case against climate skeptics is not convincing. About the worst they can come up with is an executive of the George C Marshall Institute quitting because he finds out one of the top guys is a lobbyist. They bring up Climategate as if it was somehow orchestrated by these think tanks. Michael Shermer comments on it and does not seem to have a very good understanding of it.

If you're going to claim that analysts at think tanks are manufacturing doubt, you should at least look at the null hypothesis that there might be something to be doubtful of. In this day and age, people who are interested in a subject can participate in discussions and shared analysis on blogs. In the case of climate change, they have and found a lot to be doubtful of. The film shows Michael Mann getting nasty emails. Well his famous Hockey Stick graph was utterly debunked on the blog, ""Climate Audit"". There is a complete archive online that includes many classic posts such as ""Caspar Ammann, Texas Sharpshooter"" and ""The Team Defends Paleo Phrenology"". There is also a wide range of climate blogs with bloggers and commenters ranging from outright skeptics, through lukewarmers to climate activists. As a historian, Oreskes would do well to learn more about them.

But the truth is that Oreskes is on the extreme activist end of the scale. She recently caused a stir by calling people who think we need nuclear energy instead of just renewables ""deniers"". She is also the first person I know of to publicly suggest RICO investigations of skeptics. For someone who does a lot of public presentations, you rarely see anything that looks like a challenging question or a debate.",1470268800,,2019,4.7988505747126435
7168112,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a stylish documentary that keeps your interest and should raise everyone's critical thinking IQ by a few points.  The ""masters of spin"" have had their thumb on the scale for far too long, and it's time to debunk the debunkers.  MOD shows case after case, beginning with the tobacco industry, of lies, half-truths, and diversionary tactics used by private enterprise lobbying associations and other shills to confound and deny responsible independent scientific research.

It's been going on for so long that some of us have become accustomed to vetting these people whenever they come up.  Unfortunately, most of America does not.  The result is that we are often tools for the benefit of corporate moguls protecting interests that are far apart from our own.  Did you know that the tobacco companies were behind the adoption of fire retardant furniture?  One sofa can contain up to two pounds of those chemicals.  Smokers were falling asleep in bed and the industry didn't want the horrible PR so fire retardants were born.  When the chemicals were proved hazardous to health and ineffective, the tobacco industry even attacked fire fighters as behind the movement to eliminate them.  When it was found that Big Tobacco was covering up the chemical hazard and that so-called experts were lying about retardant's safety, Congress reversed itself and allowed a non-retardant choice for consumers.

Based on a previous book, the film is larger in scope and spends quite a bit of time on the issue of climate change denial -- who's doing it, and why they're doing it.  The director lets them convict themselves, while giving generous time to the experts who should have had it all along.

There will be those who turn off the movie when they realize that it's dealing partly with climate denial.  Too bad . . . if they watched long enough, they'd be looking in a mirror.  Eventually we are watching a speaker at a national Libertarian conference, a former climate-denier who changed his mind in face of overwhelming evidence.  He barely gets started and Libertarians begin leaving the room . . . they won't even listen to what he has to say.

So one of the most valuable takes for me from this film was the ""tribal"" nature of the groups inspired by these corporate shills.  Although by themselves, the shills can do a great deal of damage, they also rely on converting groups of citizens to their propaganda.  They require a passionate and energetic following to sustain their agenda.  Invoking the spirit of tribalism, that group loyalty has been used to rationalize personal agendas like smoking tobacco.  And now it's used to prop up more general beliefs about politics and individual freedoms.  When you're with a group and they're with you, you don't need to think too much or question.  The group already has a script all laid out for you.

We all wonder why certain groups go along with certain dogmas even after being presented with unflinching evidence to the contrary.  The marketing genius and enormous funding of those merchants of doubt is clever to the point of genius, provocative, and compelling enough to capture the unguarded imagination.  As Marc Morano, one self-admitted shill, admits:  he has a lot of fun pulling the wool over people's eyes and damaging the credibility of respected authorities.  It's a game to him, and a lucrative one.

This is an educational film.  A sequel might suggest strongly that the best way to finally get a handle on the paid shill industry is to lock up the liars.  As shown in MOD, some have even lied before Congress, protesting that they weren't actually ""under oath.""  The tobacco industry has only paid fines and done mea culpa.  There should be far more severe consequences to harmful lies that compromise the body politic as well as think nothing of destroying individual lives and reputations.",1469923200,,3888,4.903522205206738

The film is full of half truths and emotionally driven claims.  They completely disregard and fail to address many serious flaws in their data, the increasing sea ice and growing Antarctic ice fields, etc.  They totally dismiss the ""climategate"" scandal as a non-issue.  It's full of emotion and devoid of data and reasoning.  Having said that, the film had some merit regarding how the corporatists are manipulating the sheep, but they fail to recognize their own sins of doing the same.  They were honest about one thing; their insane and sycophantic belief that only government can offer solutions to the world's problems.

7168172,4,B00XIXGQ6S,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I love a good documentary. A documentary takes hold of a subject and takes you behind the scenes provided a depth of coverage on the topic you normally don't have access to. A well-made documentary combines everything possible to make it entertaining as well as informative. The problem with most documentaries these days it that theyve become so mired in the politics of the film maker that an objective movie is rarely the end result. This isn't just those whose politics lean left as some would have you believe but both sides are doing it.

Which brings us to MERCHANTS OF DOUBT. The movie does a great job of accomplishing the goal it sets out to from the start which is letting us know about just who is behind many of the major issues being discussed in todays world. Who are the talking heads that the news agencies go to when they need to confirm or deny a story? And are those talking heads being up front with us or do they have a motivation to say what they do beneath the surface?

The main focus of the movie concerns those who speak out on scientific data that we are fed via news networks. It begins by going back to where it all began, the controversy and investigation into the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes decades ago. When reports that smoking could be bad for your health began to surface a counter attack was launched by the tobacco industry to sway the public. They didn't come out and say that it was good for you which would have left a standard to hold them to. Instead, they had various spokespeople put for the possibility that it wasn't as bad as was being said. They were planting the seeds of doubt. Were these spokespeople scientists? No. They were paid spokespeople found among the advertising industry. After all, they had a stake in this as well.

But thats just the beginning and not the end of the story. Years pass and more scientific problems are found in numerous other topics, lately in the world of climate change. And when you look deeper into the topic, as the makers of this film have, you discover that some of the same people who were experts called upon to weigh in on news networks in the stories of the past are the same ones being interviewed today, or they come from the same agencies that have ties to those groups. Their goal is not to disclaim anything being said, but to plant that seed of doubt in your mind that makes you think things are not as bad as they seem.

Its a fascinating story that needs to be told. And from the presentation done here you would assume that it is far reaching into so many things being talked about these days, everything from politics to potentially harmful products to the climate. I have no doubt that everything presented here is true. But thats when you start to wonder. If the claim is that things can be manipulated to project a positive point of view is it possible that the makers of this film are using the same strategies to plant doubt in your mind in an effort to counter the things they find harmful?

I first began to wonder that while watching this when it became apparent that there were select groups, people or news networks that they highlighted over and over again. Some of which aren't even on the standard cable channels. While watching those same names pop up over and over again I kept thinking that the odds that only these people or that one new network were the only ones doing this seemed astronomical. By the end credits I found that I felt those behind this movie had done the same thing they were accusing others of doing. They were attempting to manipulate the message to make it seem like anyone opposed to the issues at hand were guilty of manipulating things while trying to present themselves as not doing the same.

But heres the thing. Even while that was happening I kept thinking that the true responsibility of looking deeper into the news we are presented isn't up to the makers of this film not does it fall on the news networks we watch. It is up to us, the viewer, to look deeper into any and all news stories that are reported to us when it comes to so called experts weighing in on the topics at hand. Its not a question of the left wing or right wing political proponents doing this or not, the odds are that they both do it. And thats one of the best things about this movie. In following the same methods that they seem to be against it makes you realize that no matter who tells us what we need to be vigilant.

As for the quality of the end product the makers of this film have presented a highly polished and well thought out film. Everything from the quality of the film footage shot to the editing to the animated sequences are so well done as to make you marvel at how well theyve put together this film. Its slick and well-made, entertaining and informative and will hold your interest from start to finish. By the end youll find yourself watching the nightly news completely different than you have in the past.

In my opinion, the discussions of Ben Santer are incorrect. Santer's work is reviewed and criticized in my books. Merchants of Doubt misses the main point. The issue is NOT whether humans affect climate; they most likely do. The issues are (1) whether climate models are good enough to predict future global climate change due to future increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, (2) whether the impacts of future climate change are well understood, and (3) whether we can (and must) immediately drastically reduce the world rate of carbon emissions by a combination of introducing green energy, sequestration, and energy conservation at a more rapid rate, without wrecking the world economy. The answers are no, no and no. As Mr. Miyogi said: ""answer only matter if ask right question"".

The main point is that climate science has been made to look confusing to some people because hired scientists promoted doubt and confusion -- they are ""merchants of doubt"".  Oreskes and Conway, in response, carefully document a scientific consensus that CO2 heats the Earth and causes global warming, or ""global heating"" as James Lovelock calls it.  However, the end of the film features only renewable energy sources as solutions, and omits nuclear energy.  This is misleading.  Nuclear energy is the largest source of ultra-low carbon energy in most industrialized countries.  France has very low CO2 emissions for an EU country.  Finally, a prominent speaker in ""Merchants of Doubt"" - Dr. James Hansen - recently made a public statement in support of nuclear energy.  He also appeared in the interviews section of the documentary film ""Pandora's Promise"".",1436918400,2,955,5.2781456953642385
7168278,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"I loved this documentary! Let me say that I'm a fan of Michael Moore's documentaries, as well, but I found Merchants of Doubt to be more appealing across the political spectrum, instead of polarizing.  The mechanism of contrasting these cases to magic, in which participants and observers are willingly duped, set the stage for some startling (and not-so-startling) revelations about tobacco, fire retardant, and climate change experts.",1436745600,17,436,5.507462686567164

7168280,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"Not simply an excellent look at how climate denial has been sold as an alternative to reality, but also a look into the techniques used by government and business to manipulate the thinking and voting of citizens all over the world.  Those who published one and two star reviews no doubt had their world rocked by the the clarity of the evidence presented in this documentary.  If you ""can't handle the truth"" you probably don't want to watch this.  Which of course means you really must find the courage to watch it and to think about what it means for any and all of us to do the right thing knowing the truth about the lies we've been told.  Whether those lies were about cigarettes, cancer causing chemicals or the dangers posed by ever greater CO2 emissions.  Excellent look at the manipulation of the public debate and the public mind.  If I could give it 6 stars I would.",1436659200,4,878,4.490566037735849
7168281,5,B00XIXGQ6S,"Everyone with any concern about the future needs to see this movie. The ""climate change deniers"" are the same people who shilled for the tobacco companies. When a statement of ""scientists"" denying the climate is warming is signed by Michael J Fox and Dr. Charles Darwin you know it is phony propaganda trying to confuse the public.",1436486400,3,331,4.824561403508772
