6600236,4,B00MQVSEUO,"I was really delighted with the recording because the picture was clear, the soundtrack was clear, and it seemed that the blaring music from the telenovela had been toned down a bit, so you could actually hear what the actors were saying - not that it was such profound dialogue, but it's always nice to know what's going on in a film.",1419206400,,335,4.419354838709677

6600240,5,B00MQVSEUO,"I am so excited to see that Que Bonito Amor is on Amazon :). This will be one of my Auntie Monica Christmas gifts. She has being asking me if Amazon had this novela  on sale. I was really hoping that Amazon would have it before Christmas. Thank you, Thank you, and Thank You. I rate this a 5 star!  I want you to know that you have made my 85 years old auntie very happy.  I am ordering 2 video's one for me of course. I love the actors Jorge Salinas and Arturo Peniche excellent  actors.",1417564800,,488,4.0
6600241,3,B00MQVSEUO,"Loved this when I watched it on Univision and have been waiting its release. I am really disappointed that despite the info on the listing there are NO subtitles, Spanish or English.

Also, this telenovela on TV was just loaded with great mariachi music but this dvd set has almost no music except the title song. I imagine it is because of music royalties or something but it is really too bad. The music was what made this telenovela so good.",1417046400,12,444,4.481481481481482
6600242,5,B00MQVSEUO,"NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES.....RATS!!!!!  I have given 5 * because I love all telenovelas and have purchased all with English subs.
Also since I wanted to let y'all know that there are no English subs, I had to rate and it would not be fair to rate less than 4*.  Anyone have an English transcript I could follow to watch this movie.  lol",1416873600,9,332,4.32258064516129
6600243,3,B00MQVSEUO,"The telenovels is an excellent one and the abridgement is ok considering that 17 hours is only about 16% of the total length of the novela.  What is really not ok is that, despite the Amazon dvd description, there are no subtitles.  All recent novelas have subtitles to expand the potential market for the dvd.  This edition does not and it must be and faulty issue.  The dvd is good but the lack of subtitles limit its usefulness.",1477094400,,431,4.487179487179487

6600246,1,B00MQVSEUO,"Not only is this novella about a beautiful love story it is also about mariachi. Mariachi and their music. So much has been cut out that the magic is no longer felt. Bring the mariachi and their music back. If I could order the complete uncut version someone please inform. Give a phone number, something.",1467158400,4,305,4.5636363636363635

6600252,1,B00MQVSEUO,"Had to give it away, there were no English subtitles.  It's very important to advertise that Spanish movies have English subtitles as many of us enjoy these movies but do not speak Spanish.",1445299200,,189,4.7272727272727275
6600253,3,B00MQVSEUO,"I liked it, but was very disappointed with all the edited/deleted scenes and especially the deleting of all that beautiful music. Had I known this, I would not have purchased the DVD.  Is it possible to obtain the original uncut version?",1442534400,,237,4.780487804878049

6600258,1,B00MQVSEUO,I SAW THE NOVELA ON TV AND I NOTICED THAT THE DVD WAS NOT COMPLETE AS WE SAW IT.  THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OF THE MUSICAL SCENES WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  WILL THERE BE A NEW DVD WITH THE REMOVED SCENES?,1435104000,,237,4.0
6600259,1,B00MQVSEUO,"One of the worst soaps I've ever watched! Can't believe what Televisa did with the wonderful ""La hija de del Mariachi"". Awful adaptation and --worst of all, edition. Music, which was an essential part of the story, was left out.",1433030400,,228,4.725

6600264,1,B00MQVSEUO,"I rated this a 1 for this particular video version.  The novel story line itself is a 5 as shown in the original form.  DO NOT BOTHER TO BUY THIS DVD if you are expecting what you saw in the TV version! It is a disservice to such beautiful story.  I bought it because I wanted to watch this again, but they chopped off so much of the beautiful songs and the scenes in the bar where it took place that the story did not flow properly.  I could only stand to watch a couple of hours of the first cd and then returned it.  What a horrible version was put together for this DVD.  IT would have been better not to even do it at all.  I wish they would do it right and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",1423267200,,699,3.8461538461538463
6600265,1,B00MQVSEUO,"Very very disappointed!!!  The Mariachi songs were all delete from the program, not to meation lots of the novel parts were cut out.
Scenes jump from one thing and back to another, trying to make out or figure out what going on here.
For what we pay not worth it.",1422662400,2,263,4.26

6600271,4,B00MQVSEUO,"Because I watched the original faithfully every night on Univision when it was on television, I had been watching and waiting for Amazon to make this available.  I actually pre-ordered this, and I'm glad I did.  This is one of the best telenovelas I have ever watched.  The leading lady is beautiful, and the leading man is a gentleman, and the audience can really understand why they fall for each other.  It really is a great romance.

My mother and I watched this together, and we loved to see the gorgeous outfits that Maria wore while performing.  The colors of the set were so bright and vivid, and the songs they perform are good.  There was even humor thrown in.  We had to laugh because there was pictures of Vincente Fernandez in frames on the wall, and we would look for pictures of him in the different scenes that they showed.

And with 4 discs, the price is not bad.  Just beware-- there are no English subtitles......I would still buy it though.",1419292800,6,960,4.52906976744186

8674135,2,B00MQVSEUO,Good but what only makes this soap opera bad is that they cut out the music scenes,1503360000,,82,3.8823529411764706

8674141,1,B00MQVSEUO,"This was a huge disappointment. The editing was so fierce in order to condense it, that the storyline hardly made any sense and scenes would jump in a flash from one scene to the next with no thought for storyline continuity.

I began to watch this Telenovela while I was in Chile for a period of 4 weeks and a great deal of what I saw was just a blur in the DVD version. I feel it's a rip-off to condense the storyline to such a degree that it becomes a joke and a disappointment to the buyer.

I will not be buying these telenovelas again.",1484265600,,541,4.09433962264151
