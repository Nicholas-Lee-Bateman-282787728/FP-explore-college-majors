4867386,3,B005S9EJ14,"The easiest way to describe this film is by saying it's about a group of British old people making a fool of themselves in India. That's essentially the film in one sentence, but also doesn't really seem fair in the long run.

Seven retirees from Britain all decide to travel to India for different reasons. Muriel (Maggie Smith) is having hip surgery, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton)'s daughter invested their life savings into a get rich quick scheme that still hasn't paid off, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is looking for a change in scenery after her husband has passed, Graham (Tom Wilkinson) grew up in India and is looking forward to returning there, Madge (Celia Imrie) is looking for a rich suitor who can make her feel like a desirable woman again, and Norman (Ronald Pickup) is just lonely and looking for that particular someone to make the last few years of his life worth living. With the low cost and exotic scenery of India enticing them, they all decide to stay at the newly restored Marigold Hotel. Unfortunately things aren't as advertised and the hotel is still undergoing massive renovations when they arrive. While the trip they wind up taking doesn't end up being the one they planned, it evolves into something they never could have counted on and are forever affected by their stay there.

The most unique thing about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that everyone has different personalities. Everybody seems to be so different from one another on the surface, but are much more alike underneath than they could have ever imagined. Muriel is the most surprising, especially if you've only seen Maggie Smith in the Harry Potter franchise. Her ignorant racist comments result in some of the most memorable scenes in the film. Douglas felt like the character I related to the most (I'm sure it'll probably be different for everyone). His tendency to stay quiet the majority of the time, but then blow everyone away with his sarcastic wit reminded me quite a bit of myself. Graham seemed very private at first, but the film immediately becomes more sentimental once he reveals why he actually came back to India. Evelyn's journey is the most emotional. You also spend the most time with her, but seeing her life transform from the beginning of the film to its conclusion is pretty spectacular.

The only character I couldn't stand was Jean. She was so hypocritical and close-minded. Then to top it off, she threw several hissy fits because she didn't get her way and because ""India is hot."" Those types of people get on my last nerve and I couldn't wait to see the last of her. Sonny's (Dev Patel) blind optimism is a little irritating especially since everything is going so terribly for him, but his enthusiasm causes him to be the comedic relief in nearly every scene he's in.

When asked what I thought after the movie ended, my big joke was, ""I think I was about 40 years too young for that."" In all honesty though, it isn't quite that bad. While I don't necessarily fall into the demographic it's aimed towards, there are still things to enjoy and appreciate along the way. The humor featured in the film did seem to fall flat more often than not, but I found things were at their strongest whenever somebody told a story about their past. That's when things would become the most emotional, genuine, and absorbing. The heartfelt moments were greater than the attempts at humor. The message the film gives is also easy to relate to as everyone wants to reach the top of that mountain and life is always taking turns we don't expect. At the end of the day, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is similar to Albert Nobbs in the sense that it's not necessarily a bad film but just isn't really the type of film that speaks to me the way that it should.",1336348800,12,3780,4.671171171171171
4867387,5,B005S9EJ14,"John Madden's ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" may not be a great film, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable one that will keep you entertained from beginning to end. It isn't challenging in the slightest, which has caused many critics to downgrade it, or damn it with faint praise. All I know is that the audience in the packed theater where I saw the film applauded at the end, and I applauded with them.

By now everyone knows the story of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" A group of English retirees decides for various reasons (mostly financial) to move to India. The retirement hotel they choose sounds glorious from the brochure, but turns out to be a rundown, if once-grand, hulk run by a young Indian with much more enthusiasm than skill. A lot of comedy ensues, and a little conflict and tragedy; attitudes are changed, old bonds broken, and new bonds forged.

The ensemble cast of British character actors ranges among the super-famous (Judi Dench, Maggie Smith), the moderately famous (Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) and the not-so-famous (Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie), with the addition of one young rising star (Dev Patel, of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame). All of them are as charming, funny and touching as they possibly could be. Meanwhile, Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker do an excellent job of blending and articulating the various plotlines, aided by the gorgeous photography by Ben Davis and the insinuating score by Thomas Newman. Considering the effort all these master professionals made to give an audience a good time, it seems churlish to give ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" any less than five stars.",1336262400,322,1637,4.970802919708029
4867388,3,B005S9EJ14,"This film is not the first to employ the plot device of a bunch of ill-matched strangers thrown together with their individual stories, who develop self-knowledge through interaction with each other in a new environment. The setting here is contemporary Jaipur and the characters are a bunch of fish-out-of-water Brits in their twilight years; a new twist on the old storyline. So what's `The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' like as a viewing experience?

The answer is generally good, with minor reservations. The Brit A-list cast of autumn-years players is made, either by skilled make-up or even more skilled close-up camerawork, to look - well, so old, especially when contrasted to the youthful dynamism of some of the Indian cast. Is this supposed to be a not-so-subtle metaphor about these two nations and their current global profiles?

The Rajasthan locations are brought to life by superb camerawork and editing and a great eye for detail. The film captures Jaipur to perfection, though of course you don't get the overpowering olfactory cocktail of cattle, incense and spices, perfumes, diesel fumes and industrial pollution of modern India on film, nor the searing >40C dry heat in the summer.

At times TBEMH has the feel of a Mike Lee film, with his technique of allowing the actors to determine story development by their own real-life interactions in front of the camera. At other times it's obviously scripted; funny, poignant and touching and occasionally a bit heavy-handed. The characters rather predictably develop, learn and change as they interact with India and with each other: some adapt to their new home like ducks to water and with a sense of adventure; others don't fare so well, and some take time to eventually feel at home. A sub-plot between the young, enthusiastic and eternally optimistic hotel manager (Dev Patel) and his pretty moped-riding, call-centre-employed girlfriend (Tena Desai) is used to explore the struggle between the new India with self-assertive young professionals living by western values and the traditional controlling influence of their Indian families. Unfortunately the confrontational resolution of this conflict will be seen by some viewers as melodramatic and trite - actually it's positively toe-curling, and that's all I'm going to say.

Overall, not a bad film but short of excellent. See it for the veteran cast turning in some fine performances, a good-but-not-great script containing a few surprises amongst the clich&eacute;s (cricket playing street kids, Indian university graduates working in call-centres, the iniquities of the Hindu caste system) and some great one-liners: an overall feel-good and life-affirming viewing experience set in stunning Jaipur locations.",1335484800,,2736,5.370629370629371

We started with a smile which rarely faded in this lovely PG-13 comedy. Here are gathered the best old war horses of British cinema. What a treat! And as a bonus, a trip through the color and chaos of modern-day India as seen through the eyes of seven senior citizens caught up in major culture shock. Each of our principal players is going to India for his or her own reason: to find a lost love; to look for a rich maharajah, to find a cheap place to live, to rejuvenate a marriage, to get a new hip; the reasons are as diverse as the people.

We have:
  * Judi Dench (""As Time Goes By"") Told to imagine her audience naked to overcome her stage fright: I think I'm a bit past all that...""
  * Bill Nighy (""Blow Dry"") After failing to fix a leaky water tap: ""Now that I've got the hang of it, do you have anything else I can NOT fix?""
  * Maggie Smith (""Downton Abbey"") In response to the National Health Care's six-month wait for a new hip: ""Six months! At my age, I don't plan anything that far ahead. I don't even buy green bananas!""
  * Tom Wilkinson (""The Debt"") Answering the question, ""What do you see out there?"" he beams, ""Smiles!""
  * Penelope Wilton (""Match Point"") Sitting in the stifling, self-imposed exile of her room, ""How can you STAND it out there?""
  * Ronald Pickup (lots of TV) When asked the advisability of sex for senior citizens, ""Well, if she dies, she dies!"" He is an aging wanna-be gigolo who can get an astonishing amount of ""action"" from two aspirin!
  * Celia Imrie (""Cranford"") thinks she's got enough ""it"" for at least one more go at landing a wealthy husband.
  * Dev Patel (""Slumdog Millionaire"") Trying to recapture his deceased father's dream: ""Everything will be all right in the end. If it's not all right, it's not the end.""
  * Tena Desae (""Yeh Faasley"") joins the pantheon of gorgeous stars formed in the Bollywood galaxy. We love her as she trains at a call center and copes with disapproval.

Each character is in one crisis or another but no ends are left dangling. This is a satisfying and entertaining look at a country most of us will never visit but which intrigues us, nonetheless. We see remnants of the old caste system, while we recognize remnants of a new one which flit by, unnoticed; AND we appreciate the skill with which each old pro commands his or her moment in the spotlight. I can hardly wait until this is available on DVD from Amazon.com!",1333843200,111,2470,4.420353982300885
4867391,4,B005S9EJ14,"""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a comedy-drama film with an all-star British cast.

The story follows seven retirees who are drawn to an Indian hotel that accommodates the elderly, and most of the group is single. They all have their own reasons as to why they are departing Britain, and as the narrative unfolds it becomes clear that they are seeking new beginnings and resolution from the past.

The characters have well defined personalities which are strongly conveyed by acclaimed actors. The cast includes: Judi Dench, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, and Dev Patel.

The movie allows the viewer to appreciate that the challenges of life can push people out of their comfort zones, yet it is still possible to find a place that is peaceful and enlightening by daring to search for it.

4867392,4,B005S9EJ14,"""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is great feel good film.  I found it to be quite captivating and am very glad that I made the effort to see it.  I recommend it to others.

In brief, the film revolves around the coming together of seven elderly and somewhat impecunious Britons who, of their own volition, and quite separately, decide to retire to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur.  They discovered the place on the internet and, as we all should know, the internet can sometimes be a bit misleading.  Indeed, this is the case here.  The hotel had been billed as a marvelous palace when, in fact, it was tired and chaotic.

The seven visitors form the key members of the cast and are led by Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Bill Nighy.  Some can adjust to the way of life in India while others fail completely.  Along the way, we are given a peek into daily life in India in all its colour and noise.

The movie is often funny but always enthralling.  I will say no more as to the plot.  I have no wish to spoil this film for others. However, I will say that it is money and time very well spent.",1332633600,566,1100,4.260869565217392

4867817,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie is very sweet and good natured.  A lovely tale of several Aging British residents who have come to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur, India to retire.  The hotel they arrive at is much less than ""exotic"" or fabulous as it's described in the literature, but the adventures are rich and exotic in themselves.  The character of Sonny, played by Dev Patel is a wonderful young man, filled with hopes and ideals to truly create a magnificent place for the Seniors to reside.  They all start out befuddled and uncertain as to their decision to move half way around the world to this place in hot, crowded India.  But, together and individually they find out more about themselves as they explore this exotic, foreign land.  Many famous British actors are on display here including Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson, and not least Dame Judy Dench.  I found it sweet, funny and poignant.  I highly recommend it.",1501632000,,930,4.732919254658385

It has a great cast of actors,an exotic Asian location,a superb story line,with  generous touches  of humour and some bittersweet reality stirred well in to the curry,and I found myself wondering why I hadn't thought of going to a magic place like this when I gave up the wonderful world of work many years ago!
If movies of this sort,no bad language either, appeal to you,don't hesitate,its thoughtful,intelligent,and above all,gentle,and you can buy it to enjoy with the whole family and,who knows,if you're a golden oldie too,you may find the""kids""looking at you in a slightly different way,at the end of it!

I had no idea there was a ""first"" until my sister asked if I had seen the ""first.""  The first time I watched this ""first"" version of Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, I thought it a bad first attempt and terribly depressing compared to the 2nd Best Exotic. Seriously, I did. The only good thing I could say about it was that it gave background to the Second Best Exotic. I bought this as a companion to The Second Best Exotic, so that I could watch them in order. I still feel that the first one is just providing background to the second, but I like it better now than the first time I watched it.

It has a great brochure, which portrays it in glowing terms, and attracts the attention of several different aging British people.  They don't look forward to their retirement years in England, in tiny apartments and with mechanized systems dealing with them.  There is also the expense factor, wanting to stay in a place where their funds will stretch farther.  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel seems to be a good bet and they all move there.  However, they find they are the first to arrive and the glowing promise is more the future dream of its young Manager.  They have to cope with its shortcomings, a culture and people they don't know, and the different people within their group.  The enthusiastic, but disorganized, young Manager and the new situations gradually grow on them and they begin to relax and like their surroundings.  The star British cast (including Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith and Bill Nighty) does a fantastic job.  The street scenes and views of Jaipur are great and give the viewer an impression of what it really would be like to live there.",1488672000,7,1135,4.809278350515464

The new cast members/characters seamlessly blended to give an intimate continuity made up for the fact that I couldn't recall the details of the first movie. The new stories are enchanting and the ending left me mostly satisfied, a little misty-eyed and hoping there might be another venture with them someday.

The highest praise I could give would be to say that it was almost as if these screenplays were written separately and some brilliant accident helped them find each other so that they could let us spend more time with these friends in this most exotic wonderful place.

The plot centers on old people leaving their jobs and families and looking for sex, status, and adventure in India.

With the talent available, the directors could have created a timeless masterpiece like Slumdog Millionaire or a charming diversion like 1000 Foot Journey.  Instead, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a crass interpretation of Indian tradition and the aging process uniformly out of touch with the values of the demographics portrayed.",1461801600,,616,5.329896907216495

I was also pleasantly surprised seeing so many faces that I know from Downton Abbey. Still, while watching this movie, you get so immersed in the lives of these people that you forget them from the other show. Dame Judi Dench was my favorite. She was also the narrator of the story.

4869984,5,B005S9EJ14,"Great movie about the retirement years and the importance of not only being able to adapt, but thrive as a senior citizen. I show this movie in a psychology course I teach about aging as it's an excellent teaching tool. This movie does an excellent job portraying the different types of struggles seniors go through post retirement, especially as spouses start dying and we're confronted with our own mortality in the form of health problems. The main characters do a wonderful job of questioning what kind of life they can have at their age and ability. They dare to not believe they are too old to have a good, and fulfilling life. Aging in today's society is a different dynamic than it was even 30 years ago because technology has become a new part in the need to survive and adapt. The main characters in this movie each tackle a different retirement and aging issue, and demonstrate the facets and complications that go along with it. They also demonstrate the options available: survive by adapting and thriving as opposed to just getting by, or refuse to adapt and don't survive.

Character development is so much deeper and well rounded than you find in most films these days. English actors really do know how to engage their audience so much better than American actors. The movie is seriously a great 2 hours, and something you'll enjoy watching over and over, and showing to your friends.",1460937600,,1401,4.741803278688525

It lightens and darkens throughout the movie and on my TV, it showed only on the center section of the screen (there's no doubt a technical term for this, but I don't know it.) The ""extras"" are very short and not that interesting, the interviews might be 10 seconds long, etc.  All in all, a poor quality DVD, but I guess one can't expect much for $5.00. .",1456963200,,493,4.290322580645161

4870938,5,B005S9EJ14,"I love this movie.  It is a sweet ode to the human spirit, and shows that you are never too old or dispirited to change your life.  The fact that the characters accomplished this by moving to India because they couldn't afford  to live in England any longer made you worry for them, and then be happy for them.  The owner of the hotel  does a great job in trying to make money, but also in displaying love for his customers.  Visually the movie is gorgeous with a riot of colors and sounds.

Separately, they find the information about Sonny's hotel and decide to move to India. They meet, for the first time, at the airport and travel to the same hotel in India, which is owned by Sonny.  The cast includes: Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith,  Tom Wilkinson, and Dev Patel. A good story about their experiences learning to live in a new culture.  Has laughter as well as some serious parts, but is a good upbeat movie.",1448841600,,598,4.613207547169812

4871607,5,B005S9EJ14,"This is a delightful movie with an all star ensemble cast.  An unlikely group of senior citizens who are still full of life discover a promise of something better than the ""old folks home"" in India, at the ""Marigold Hotel"".  The hotel is more of a dream of the young owner, hoping to transform a run down property into a lovely home for his guests.  The guests become friends of sorts, encouraging each other to explore their dreams.  Each has their own plot, and some intersect each other.  In the end you are left with with hope of heart, and who can;t use that?
There is a sequel to this movie, ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" and I am going to watch it next.  It may give some continuity to see them  close together.  Enjoy!",1448409600,,736,4.360294117647059

Hollywood typically ignores those stories, but this charming film addresses many hard issues and some more modern questions.

I think you have to be older to appreciate the story line - and then you can really relate to the situation these people are in; people under 60 might not understand.

Scenes and music of India enliven credible story lines, and it's a good story of making something good out of hard disappointments.

They all go the Exotic Marigold Hotel where they find themselves. Each character has a reason for going. The hotel is run by Sonny (Dev Patel from ""Slumdog Millionaire."")

The movie is exquisitely filmed on location in England and in Jaipur, India with a great cast, solid writing, and perfect direction. The film is solid entertainment. The DVD features only two extra features such as a three minutes behind the scenes and a three minutes casting.",1444608000,,671,4.938053097345133
4872017,4,B005S9EJ14,We liked the movie a lot but my wife didn't think it was as good as I did.  The actors and actresses are iconic British stars and I thought they were very good.

Superb actors Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, and Tom Wilkinson are cash-strapped seniors who've decided to ""outsource"" their retirement to a resort in far-off India. Dev Patel completes the ensemble as the Exotic Hotel manager. It's a wonderful group of fantastic actors with an entertaining storyline and great writing to match.

4872038,1,B005S9EJ14,Not my kind of film ... typical Hollywood immorality portrayed as acceptable and normal. It may be common but it's not acceptable or healthy. Would not recommend this except to show how the morality of our western culture is in a definite decline. No wonder the fabric of our country is unravelling and there is so much unhappiness and mess. Very twisted portrayal in an emotionally acceptable manner. no thanks!,1444348800,3,412,4.9

4872750,5,B005S9EJ14,"Though clearly made for Western audiences, and the stereotypes of Indian Bollywood movies are still present, what makes this movie truly stand out is the very sensitive handling of the issues of aging and death in Western culture. The acting is superb, of course, given the stellar cast, but the story line itself takes chances with forcing us to look at why we treat our aging population so poorly in Britain and the USA. India has many of its own problems to deal with, but there is deep honor and empathy pervasive in much of Indian society, perhaps rooted in the evolving acceptance of different beliefs and values that the new country of India has had to develop, and though this was just a bit of silver-screen fiction, it feels very much like it could be a real story. I hope so. I want the kind of compassion and values this movie shows to become the norm for all cultures as we grow up and move away from caste systems, ageism, and consumerism.",1440806400,,953,4.514450867052023

4872933,1,B005S9EJ14,"This movie was bad in so many ways.

Sadly, most of the British characters are archetypes, aka, stereotypes: the strained married couple with the materialistic and controlling wife, the lonely widow, the bitter old racist, and the person in search of a long-lost relationship.  Even sadder is that the Indian characters are caricatures: the cowardly buffoon with big dreams, his dominant mother, and his loose girlfriend.

Once our adventurous pensioners arrive in India, you can guess how the main story will play out.  Ultimately, as you might guess, despite all the personal issues that the British characters were working through, they are still able to rescue the poor, helpless Indian boy.  After all, we're told ""everything will be alright in the end. So if it's not alright, then it's not the end.""  At times, I found myself wanting everything to be alright just so the movie would end.

Oh, where would the world be without the benevolence and wisdom of the British--even the ones that despise you?

The plot and the characters were enough to make the movie disappointing.  I won't even comment on the message that the movie sends about sexuality and valuing relationships.",1439942400,6,1182,5.02051282051282

There are love stories of many different types with the Hotel owner Sonny pulling it all together while trying to deal with his own personal life both family and fiance. The most refreshing part is that there is little nudity leaving more to the imagination as of movies of a bygone era.

4873997,4,B005S9EJ14,"This is a beautiful movie. If you're into action flicks with stuff blowing up, car chases, and lots of shooting action, this isn't for you, but you probably already knew that... The characters are beautifully written, and while some may find it hard to identify with the plight of retired people, when you look deeper it's really about all of us, looking for happiness, love and meaning as we deal with the current situation life has dealt us. In that regard, it has a lot to say that is applicable to anyone who is willing to listen.

Besides enjoying the characters and watching them search to build new, fulfilling lives for themselves, the movie is beautifully shot. The cinematography and lighting are stunning, so if you're into that sort of thing, you'll want to watch it just for that. (I realize that's a really geeky thing to enjoy a movie for, but some of us are just like that.)",1436572800,,890,4.59748427672956

4874125,4,B005S9EJ14,"Good  movie, engaging, funny and  interesting. Takes the viewer on an adventure in India through the lens and point of view of each character in a way that really makes you think about how one reacts to new and/or very different cultures. Gave me a new awareness of how easily one can go into a new situation or place where we have already tacked up  pre-set expectations for how things will be or should go, and perhaps even have let cutlural stereotypes creep in regarding a culture or its people.

Watching this film made me think about these things. As I saw some of the characters begin their experience, entering into India and its cuture, but  these ladies in particular were coming in already weighed down by their own sets of expectations and others bulging with stereotypes about India itself, its people, its food, and even their accomodations. In one case the character was just plain racist to begin with! But observing them all from day 1 til the end of the film, during their experiences in India and at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, it was a great study in human adapability. Some were  bogged down at first and disappointed that what they had imagined the experience would be like was definitely not what they got....pre set expectations ripped away.  And while some of them adapted, let go of those expectations, stopped trying to make new ones, dropped the sterotypes, and in one character's  case, finally dropped those negative racist ideas about India and its people. It was only then, when those characters dropped all that baggage, left it behind and just embraced the adventure, that they began to truly see and experience India, it's culture, it's people, its customs. For those charcters in the film who let go and actually wanted to experience the real India, they found it a place of dazzling beauty, bursting with bright colors, many new and interesting places and things to be explored and experienced. They found a country full of amazing people and realized those sterotypes served no purpose other than to cause hurt and were happily discarded.
The one character who never made any efforts to embrace the adventure, see the culture, meet new people or try new things  and carried her baggage and negativity the whole time. ...she was the only one who was miserable.

I think it was smart to showcase that contrast in the film,  it really drove the message home, and also added extra layers to the plot. By watching her stay negative, complain constantly, refuse to try anything and miss out on the entire experience...caused her to be the only one who wasn't changed for the better. In sharp contrast however, her  husband did tbe opposite. He got out there and experienced everything he could,  tried to squeeze every drop out of his daily experiences....and you could see it change him, he come into the man he wanted to be. And in the end, his wife was the one that set him free, finally getting honest that neither had been happy in a long time and their marriage was a shell. She set him free, because by her leaving him there in India and telling him it's over,  he didn't have to do what I think he would have done otherwise out of loyalty...tried to stick it out with her.  So they both got what they wanted,  and perhaps needed, in the end.

The overall point is to just jump in, experience it all eyes open. Embrace the spontaneous, roll with it when things don't turn out exactly as planned, get out there,  see new places,  immerse yourself in new cultures, see what this world has to offer. We have such a small drop of a lifetime compared to eternity. Let's use what we have to explore, to find joy, to experience the new,  the unknown and the known.  To seek personal growth through learning new things,  meeting new people, helping others, seeking the beauty in the world, both in the big things and the small. And don't forget to laugh and not take everything too seriously!",1436400000,4,3927,4.652677279305355

It's like watching the dream of an old lady about all her old lady friends. Is it true that all these people can talk like a book author, non stop?

4874750,4,B005S9EJ14,"In the days of the Raj, in the days when the British ruled India with an iron fist, a massive naval fleet at the ready, and footloose soldiers of fortune (or rather of no fortune since the eldest son took all the dough and land and left younger brothers to the universities, the clergy, the civil service and the army) no one from the imperial center would have thought to retire to that benighted country. Rather they would spent their youth grabbing whatever they could grab and retire back in the old country in some at least modest splendor. Ah, but times have changed and John Bull has hit upon tough times as the denizens of this witty and thoughtful film demonstrate. Now the average Brit seeing his or her life circumstances at home reduced looked to the new emerging economic engine of the 21st century the old Raj to make ends meet, or to just get away from the stale life in the home country.

Of course the setting of this film in the old Raj, and in an old hotel that had seen better days with a cast of wayward elderly ex-patriates and a wacky entrepreneurial Indian allows the director and scriptwriter to investigate all kinds of subjects from multiculturalism to haughty vestiges of the old Empire refracted through new India, ageism, sexual impulses about the older set, adjusting (or not) to a new culture, old school closeted gayness, stale marriages, failed marriages and the aches and pains of growing old wherever you find yourself marooned. Somebody had to tell the story though and that is done through the thoughts of the narrator Mrs. Greensleeves (played by Dame Judith Dench) who had gone off to India to live cheaply since her late husband did not provide enough to keep her going, and to find herself of course. Along the way she does so although not without the usual problems of those who were sheltered from the world by old school marriage when hubby did, or didnt, take care of everything. She finds herself, her presence helps a husband caught in a horrible and stale marriage find himself (and indirectly that scorned wife as well), helps a lonely old man finds love, helps a lonely old women continuing to hope to find love, and helps the Indian innkeeper to stand up for himself against the old India represented by his old-fashioned mother. All wrapped up in the bow of a hotel that had seen better days, and all relationships filled with if not happy endings at least hope as they fade. A feel good movie with a great ensemble cast well worth a couple of hours of your time.",1433462400,,2516,4.591111111111111

If I found myself in a place with these characters, I would feel very blessed. You can tell that all but one sincerely likes everyone. Even though the one departs in the end, she, too, played a part in the dynamics. Maggie Smith saves the day and you never expected her to do so!

However, this movie, although well acted, was neither a comfort or exciting.  I felt sorry that all these active seniors could do is go and sit at a hotel and occasionally explore.  My idea of a ""retirement"" in an exotic area is to go out and ""smell the roses"" and be at a hotel only for sleeping and eating, not living the rest of my life this way.  Just like I cannot consider a retirement home at all appealing; I would rather go out and live in a tent in the wilderness.

Some of the characters were totally unappealing and I wished they had departed earlier.  Some of the characters were upbeat and tried to do more, but too many were either whiny, irritating or uninteresting",1431216000,,874,4.535031847133758

I took my husband (dragged him) and we saw it in the local theater the second day it was shown.  WE and the audience loved it and we all laughed, chartered and felt the sadness in the one situation, together.  THIS is a wonderful movie but best enjoyed by people over 60.

4875833,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie was very good.  An unintentionally group of retired, senior aged people, independently decide to change their lives and relocate to live in India (based on a brochure) and end up together at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for retired people.  The hotel itself is rundown and not really habitable (that's the parallel story); but some of the people decide to try to make it work: Judy Dench's character for one; Maggie Smith's character for another.  The men simply accept their circumstances and are willing to give it a try. One of the other lady's is a stick in the mud, refuses to try to accept the culture and makes it difficult for everyone, including her husband. For one gentleman, he is returning to the home of his youth and searches out his first love, but he has also come home to die.  Another, he's looking for a rich woman to become involved with.  If you are a senior citizen, this story will hit close to home and even encourages optional thoughts about retirement.  It is a moving story about how each individual copes with their decisions to live out their golden years.",1430265600,,1099,4.639175257731959

4875970,5,B005S9EJ14,Having visited India in 1987 I found the movie compared a lot to what I remember about it.  I found the idea facinating that elderly people could retire cheaply in India. I have shown this movie to other people in my family and they enjoyed it too.  I wanted to see this movie before seeing the Second best exotic Marigold Hotel.

I showed the film in the nursing home where I work and, at the end, you should have head the applause from the elderly residents.  I show quite a few films there and have never before heard such approval from the audience.  Although the story will appeal to many elderly viewers, the film has much to offer everybody and should not be described as an ""old folks movie"".  It will appeal to anyone who is interested in life and the situations in which people can find themselves.  The Indian setting adds color and spice to the film.

All elderly English seeking to cast their bread upon the waters to see if they can recapture some spark in their lives. All have intricate pasts and this film is worth your time.

4875998,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie is a treat given the penchant for movie producers to hire the odd actor to stand in place and wrap them in a nonexistent, computer generated world. The actors are actors and they will seem familiar to you from a history of movies of the near past. Others in it are far more famous in both name and talent.  Add an exotic location and a world of color and a world of culture that is different from our own and it is magic.

4876258,5,B005S9EJ14,"Being sufficently Anglophile, we enjoyed the cast as each were introduced in their roles. Then, it was nearly serendipitous to see our heroes traveling to the same country, the same city, and the same hotel together. We all seem to arrive together with increasing differences, then divide into individuality. From England to India, from relatively separate social castes and life styles to one hotel not exactly ""best exotic"" seemed to be an incredible deficit of cinematic plot. But, there was something joyous in learning more of each character and their relationships with others and most personal sense of the world. The cultural shock of moving or leaving an old civilized, European nation of the world (UK) to living in retirement amidst an ancient civilization based on different cultural values and belief systems that are seemingly incomprehensible to Western civilization folk seems most appropriate for viewing. Then, the fun begins. Most creative and innovative use of the talented ensemble to bring life to a hotel perched on the brink of generational family disaster. In the space of 48 hours, we watched this miraculous, life giving movie three times; and our enjoyment grew, and our fascination moved to complete understanding and appreciation.

4876299,4,B005S9EJ14,"Definitely a feel good movie - starts out in chaos and conflict but everyone discovers what they really want and gets it in the end - just like real life (:>).  Think of it as several Hallmark of Lifeline movies all going on at the same time.  The best part was that the unfolding of people's stories, needs, and how it all came together.  There were as well some touching moments as people faced aging, usefulness, change, adaptation, and regret.

Of course,the  movie had the obligatory reference to racism, being Gay, and standing up for the love in your heart woven into the story line in order to make it a proper Hollywood vehicle as well as taking on being widowed, loneliness and codependency.

The corniest part of the movie is when the hotel manager confronts his mother with his love for a girl his mother does not approve and the mother, resolved in her refusal, is suddenly wistfully taken back to a day when she stood for love over the dictates of her parents.  Pllllleeeeeessssseeee!  Would have been more honest if the mother just disowned the son and they struggled through life courageously.

If you are in a place of stress over the problems in your life and the horrendous things happening in the world's news, a little fantasy where everything works out in the end of a two hour movie might be the relief you need.",1429401600,7,1335,4.57563025210084

4877250,3,B005S9EJ14,"""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" tries to be a dramedy about a group of English retirees who move to a dilapidated resort in Jaipur, India in search of adventure or just cheap accommodations. Evelyn Greenslade (Dame Judi Dench) is a recently widowed housewife never before on her own. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) is a high court judge returning to India after a 40-year absence to find a long lost friend. Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) have a strained marriage and strained finances after losing money in their daughter's internet start-up. Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith) is a racist former housekeeper in India to get a cheap hip replacement. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is trying to recapture his youth with some romantic adventures. Flirtacious Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) is looking for a new, preferably rich, husband. They are all greeted by the indomitably optimistic manager of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel -""for the Elderly and Beautiful"", he says- Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), who struggles to renovate the hotel and convince his disapproving  mother to accept his modern girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae).

I say it tries, but the film does not succeed in being either dramatic or funny. The trailer gives the impression of a comedy, but the poor attempts at humor are sparse. This is an excruciatingly formulaic drama. It gets off to a slow start, as we are introduced to each character and his or her predicament in England. The film runs over 2 hours, way too long for this genre. The introductory material is tedious and could have been incorporated into the drama once the characters have reached India. The characters are two-dimensional, and we never know them well, with the exception of Evelyn, whose diary entries make sporadic voiceover narration -another unnecessary and lazy device. Mrs. Donnelly is convincingly abrasive, but it's not remotely plausible that an older person with such deep-seated prejudices could be relieved of them simply by contact with a competent doctor and a competent maid. Jean is a shrew whom the writers have created specially for us to dislike. We never understand her behavior; she's just supposed to be a villain. Within these confines, the cast does an admirable job. There is just not much for them to work with.

The DVD (Fox Searchlight 2012): The only bonus features on the disc are previews. Dubbing is available for the movie in Spanish and French. English Descriptive Audio is also available. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish.",1427932800,,2545,5.09832134292566

Having now seen The Second Most Exotic Marigold Hotel, I think the second is better, but you really should see thge first before the second. The acting is amazing, as you would expect from Judi Densch, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Dev Patel.

This is such a beautiful experience watching seniors struggle through lifes different set of circumstances to come out with resolve and courage to challenge themselves. Each individual had to overcome some type of difficulty and it was sad ,happy, but most of all so powerful to watch. Living in a country that values older people as usefull, wise and resourceful  is indeed a joy in itself. The crowded streets, the poverty of the surroundings is put into shadow by the beauty of the inner love of all humanity by the people toward the foreign visitors living in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. They all grew and learned in their senior years, just as the watcher of this wonderful heartfelt movie. Not one to miss. The cast is wonderful! Hurrah",1426636800,,867,4.65359477124183

4879939,3,B005S9EJ14,"Of course I am always lured by any movie or series that comes out starring Judi Dench or Maggie Smith,and their performances in this were good, albeit their roles are now stereotypical. I suspend harsher criticism because the purpose here is to entertain those of a certain age and humor us into seeing that life has possibilities if only you will open your mind. OK, never too late, I'm in. This is a long movie, over two hours! I found myself inventorying Judi Dench's wardrobe and jewelry and making mental notes about same, wondering if I could find them in some retail arena, dozed off at one point and restarted to make sure I didn't miss anything. Despite the stereotyping of roles, especially of Indians, I found it benign enough to still enjoy, but I am certain I should be more critical of it. What's the point, though? If I have to chose watching this to say an American gothic horror show, I'll put down my money on this and just shut up. That said, I am yearning for somebody somewhere to start turning out some good stuff, both in film and in literature. Inspire me!",1425945600,,1080,4.51530612244898

4880020,4,B005S9EJ14,"It starts a bit slow but picks up pace to become a entertaining feel-good type movie.  With a cast of mostly senior age film legends, it is a unique twist to the more common action/thriller and romantic comedies that studios pump out routinely.  As a late fan of Downton Abbey, we were pleasantly surprised to see the two great dames of the Downton series among the cast here of financially strapped seniors.  The premise is that these financially challenged seniors travel to India to meet their retirement (and, in one case, medical) needs.  Sure, there's some romance and comedy... but it's more of a story of the overall journey and relationships between these seniors as well as with their younger, ambitious hotel owner/operator.  Its a movie that all generations can enjoy.  Look forward to seeing the sequel that just came out in theaters.",1425945600,,847,4.888111888111888

4880191,5,B005S9EJ14,"This reminded me of a film genre popular during WWII - some of us are still around - where lots of stars were in the cast (of thousands, of course) of a story featuring a boarding house, hotel, or stage-door canteen. Their appearances were usually little more than cameos, but wotthehell, there was a war on. Here is a new crowd, but the roles are anything but cameo. Almost everyone is stretched, and India is really the star. I suppose this is the influence of Bollywood, but suddenly I would like to go there, noise, trash, crowds and all. Above all, the street color, exuberantly rendered, is stunning. And for a change the Indian actors are real people.
Download, buy, or even stand in line at the local Bijou, but go see it; you'll be glad you did.
And fear not, this is emphatically NOT another freak like the ""Grand Budapest"".",1425859200,,834,4.529801324503311

Don't get me wrong, I adore Maggie Smith and Judy Dench but I think I'll stick to their other movies. I couldn't even finish it. I think I got maybe 30-45 minutes into it and had to turn it off. There were so many instances that made me uncomfortable that the whole storyline was lost. I honestly couldn't stand any of the characters except those played by but Maggie Smith, Judy Dench, and Bill Nighy. Sorry to the actors/actresses but I will not be seeing the second.",1425859200,7,578,4.361111111111111

In the movie a few British and American senior citizens succumb to the siren song of an exciting getaway in an exotic land and take a vacation to the Exotic Marigold Hotel in India.  They are variously in search of love, purpose, sex, and adventure.  Unfortunately, the individual subplots are hackneyed and predictable, and the actors performances lackluster except for the hilarious high-energy performance by Dev Patel who is the proprietor of the hotel.  The scenes of crowded chaotic India are captivating and add some spice to an otherwise disappointing show.",1425859200,3,622,5.19

4880285,5,B005S9EJ14,"A lovely film about life and never giving up on dreams.

""It'll be all right in the end and if it isn't all right, it isn't the end"" is the catch-phrase for this story of a disparate group of British elders who decideto live in an Indian hotel...a widowed housewife, a mismatched husband and wife, a judge searching for the man he loved years before, an aging Lothario and his female counterpart, and a prejudiced nanny sent for surgery. They are met by a fast-talking, semi-hustling young man who owns the hotel and has dreams of his own, to bring the Marigold back to its former splendor and marry the girl of his dreams. How each achieves his goal is the basis of the srory.

It's short on plot and action but the Indian scenes, full of color and life, and the dialogue save the story from boredom. The backgrounds themselves almost warrant a second viewing so one can study their intricacy. Some of the speeches, especially the one-liners, are very British, and almost Shakespearean in their verbal beauty. There are highly recognizable faces and underplayed but excellent acting. It's a beautiful story, and though not my usual choice of film-fare, I was intrigued enough by the previews to watch it and I'm glad I did. There's a message there for all of us and not only those within the characters' age-brackets.

As it says at the end of the credits: ""At any age life can be an adventure, go for it."" That's the message of this delightful movie.",1425686400,,1452,4.598455598455598

4880294,5,B005S9EJ14,"I don't know about you, but I get so tired and bored with watching movies which feature nothing but young actors. Yes, they're just adorable but I'm not that interested. I found it so refreshing to watch a movie where almost all the characters are older adults. Each one is on a path to a new life, even at their advanced age. It may be a shock to the young'ens that older people still have romantic feelings but love and the quest for love are ageless. Colorful and exotic locale will make you feel that you've traveled along with them on the adventure. If you're looking for splashy special effects or super-heroes, this is not your movie. If you are looking for a good story with real people and real lives, you won't be disappointed.",1425600000,,737,4.466666666666667
4880295,1,B005S9EJ14,"The interesting premise was attractive to me, as British people of different backgrounds became a new community at a hotel in India.  It was difficult for me to follow the exposition/introductory sequences, and I didn't properly understand it until I read Wikipedias synopsis.  After the exposition, though, the pacing of the movie took me aback because it is a ponderous set of incidents in India which are all tied to the characters longings for happiness.  Theyre all at retirement age and wonder where theyll get pleasure in life.  Many of the incidents in the movie don't provide much orientation as to why so-and-so is going to the marketplace or a restaurant with so-and-so.  They just do things and go places, and don't explain why, but you later learn who has a romantic attraction to who, and its sometimes deliberately scandalous (if that word even means anything anymore).  Theres also a constant tongue-in-cheek (insincere) attitude in a lot of what they say, so that almost everything about their motivations is implicit.  Some people can understand implicit storytelling better than I can.  I don't know how much of my difficulty in engaging with these characters was because of the way the exposition was written, and how much of it was because many of the incidents in India seem so inconsequential within the plot that my memory lost track of their individual backgrounds.  Additionally, for being a comedy-drama, the comedy felt mostly forced to me.  I even got tired of the relentless eagerness of the young Indian man, played by Dev Patel, who's the proprietor of the hotel.  He became less funny to me over time.  Even Will Ferrell's overeager character in Elf remained funnier to me through the movie than this character.

Those are my stylistic responses to it, and I wouldnt call the movie a poor one on those grounds alone.  I would criticize it more because of its devil-may-care attitude toward relationships, though.  I know many people don't see this as I do, but I feel it sets many relationships up for defeat when the attitude going into one is Lets try this out and see if were compatibleespecially when the relationship is meant to be permanent, and that attitude is STILL there after the relationship is supposed to have developed.  The casual attitude which every character (except maybe the dowdy old woman, played by Maggie Smith) has toward sex makes the movie all about trying to find interesting relationships, and flaunting it with each other.  It seems like every 10 minutes theres something about sex, and its irreverent always, like the Kama Sutra or the Indian proprietors free-spirited girlfriend undressing and finding its one of the older people instead of Dev Patel in the bedroom.  I think this kind of humor is cheap and uncreative and that, like many movies, this movie goes with the fantasy that sexual and relational experimentation is good for everybody.  I couldn't disagree more.

Recommendation:  A better movie about Europeans and Indians meeting each other is The Hundred-Foot Journey.  OR Million Dollar Arm (Americans instead of Europeans).",1425600000,19,3104,5.009746588693957

4880387,5,B005S9EJ14,"One could spend pages writing the praises of the cast of THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. Here are some of Britain's most acclaimed older actors in one truly inspiring film. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, two great cinematic legends, together with Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are reasons enough to see this film.
Here is the tale of seven seniors who decide to use their funds wisely by going to a retirement resort in budget friendly India. Needless to say they are in for a big surprise. The BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL may be exotic but maybe not in the best meaning of the word.
This heartwarming film is a story about friendship, love and aging with joy not anger and bitterness. These seniors have a lot to learn about life but they also  have a lot to teach the younger generation. THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is a refreshing break.

4880448,5,B005S9EJ14,"I stumbled upon this movie when I first started seeing the trailers for the soon-to-be-released sequel. The first thing that caught my eye was that the cast is full of British Super Stars; Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy just to name a few, so I thought I'd give it a shot.

The movie was quiet interesting, with good moments of drama and comedy. It's always interesting to learn more about India, and the movie allows you to see it through the eyes of a group of senior citizens from Europe. The movie had lots of heart and characters that you really can connect with.

The only down side I saw to the movie was with such a big cast, if feels like you barely go to get into everyone's back story fully, but overall, it was very well done and entertaining.",1425254400,,761,4.352112676056338

I enjoy art films or any cinema that is thoughtful and well done regardless of genre, but I will watch anything that deals with the trials and tribulations of being sixty-ish. Of course I love it when the film is well done, and the casting alone in this movie was marvelous.

I will make an attempt to see the latest version showing in theaters.,1424563200,,355,4.159420289855072

I don't think my kids would watch it--there are no chases, car-crashes or explosions--but even they might enjoy it if they gave it a chance.

The actors are all my favorite Brits from movies and Public Television's Masterpiece Theatre, and they are clearly enjoying doing this romp together.

4880689,5,B005S9EJ14,"I really wasn't old enough to remember who Maggie Smith was from child hood motion pictures.  Only as an adult, when I saw her in the Hogwarts role of Professor Minerva McGonagall, it was like seeing an old friend again. It has therefore been a pleasure to explore her catalog of theater accomplishments on the internet.  (""At my age I don't even buy ripe bananas"") sounds maybe just a bit like Phyllis Diller.  But it summarizes a basic sentiment of this group of British seniors who (with a little help from the world wide web) make the intrepid journey to India as an investment of their golden years.

I've known some folks who ventured to foreign lands after age 60.  But mostly NOT.  The character played by Judi Dench was perhaps the most logical extension of a role I'd come to be familiar with from the Brit-com, As Time Goes By.  Of course this isn't really the same character.  The independence of the war nurse and business woman she formerly developed during the love story of Lionel & Jean becomes, I think, resurgent as Judy tackles the role of a bereaved widow, and discovers a place for at least one elderly role model in the emerging tech market of modern India.

As I've been seeing trailers for a reprise of this movie, I'm looking forward to it.  As India presents the world's largest democracy, fictional accounts like these are maybe a speculative venture at portraying the type of real world enterprises growing from east/west collaboration.  We can only hope reality will follow such an optimistic course.",1424476800,2,1530,4.714285714285714

4880814,5,B005S9EJ14,"With such an all-star lineup, how could it not be? There are loads of plot summaries already, so I'll just point out why I loved this movie and why I am immediately adding it to my collection.

This is a lovely movie that made me smile, laugh out loud, and tear up a little - but ultimately left me feeling warm & fuzzy and very uplifted. It also left me with a seriously intense craving for Indian food, lol! The cast is delightful, and not just the all-stars. Dev Patel, who plays the young hotel owner ""Sonny,"" is fantastic. By the end of the movie I realized I was smiling every time he was on screen, and I don't think I've ever rooted SO hard for a character in my life!

Marigold Hotel reminded me a lot of Under the Tuscan Sun. A charming, fish-out-of-water story about starting over in a new country after your life is derailed by a loss. In Tuscan's case it was a devastating divorce, but the idea is very similar in Marigold Hotel. Each of the retirees is dealing with their own personal struggles (death of a spouse, financial loss, medical problems, etc.) and find themselves heading to India as a solution to their problems. The ensuing culture shock provides a lot of light comedy, and life doesn't work out the way any of them imagined it would, but that's of course what makes it so fun.

The only advice I would give is to watch it with subtitles. There is a LOT of background noise throughout most of the movie (music, traffic, crowds, etc.), and it wasn't far into the movie that I realized I was missing a lot of the dialogue. Some of the funniest, snarkiest lines are said really quickly and are easy to miss.

Overall this is one of the most charming, heart-warming movies I've seen in a long time. Life may not have worked out the way they planned, but it DOES work out in end (and ""if it's not all right then it's not yet the end!""). I highly recommend this one for your collection!",1422921600,,1907,4.348314606741573

Anyone that loves Judi Dench's character in 'As Time Goes By' or any of the multitude movies and TV she has done, this is a must see.

4880835,5,B005S9EJ14,"Somehow, this is a very comfortable film. There are no nasty surprises and you know, from the outset, more-or-less how the story will play out for each character. With such a gentle storyline and a stellar cast it would have been hard for any director not to produce a splendid film and John Madden (who also directed Tom Wilkinson in the excellent `The Debt') pulls it off with great aplomb. Rather than trying to avoid the clich's everyone associates with people entering their twilight years and with the Indian sub-continent, Madden jumps in with both feet, crams them in and reinforces them. With a different cast and shoddy direction it might have been Channel Five afternoon movie fodder, but the total familiarity with the British cast & themes and the carefully easy-on-the-eye cinematography (we'll have no wobble-cam here, thankyou very much...) the end result is a relentlessly nice, squidgy armchair & comfy slippers movie - it makes you all warm just thinking about it. There's no bad language, no acerbic social commentary and no moralistic message; it's just a very pleasant, heart-warming, life affirming, simple tale well told.",1421452800,,1145,5.095744680851064

4880846,5,B005S9EJ14,"I'm hardly a professional or even amateur film critic--I jut know what I like.  I'd heard good things about this movie, and when it went on sale for less than I could rent it, I said ""Send me a copy.""  I'm glad I did, because what everyone is saying is all true.

A small group of British senior citizens, each with their own reason for moving to India, all end up together in the run-down dream hotel of a young Indian wanna-be entrepreneur.  As the story goes along, they learn about themselves, each other and the larger world.  Set against the colorful background of modern India, the movie is by turns serious, comic, tragic and uplifting, and can be all of those in the space of a few minutes.  It explores several of the great themes:  ""Who am I?""  ""Why am I here?""  ""Have I lead a good life?"" all without beating its audience over the head with them.  It makes you think while entertaining you.  This is a rare thing, and I think the hallmark of films that can be labeled ""the best"".

All in all, this movie is going to make for many pleasant evenings, because you'll have to watch it over and over again before you exhaust it.",1420934400,,1135,4.327014218009479

The setting, scenery and people are good representations of this colorful and friendly nation. Excellent storyline - has some whimsical turns and nod to British humor while staying very real.

While there was no problem with the movie, the streaming process was interrupted at least 20 times by pauses and glitches that actually made me have to go back out and restart the movie TWICE (then fast forward to where it left off) in order to watch it all the way to the end.  The first night I watched it ALMOST seamlessly, but the second night, was irritating.  Still, that's an Amazon streaming problem, not a problem with the movie itself.

It really is a very well-told story with lots of interesting people. Even the one character who is easy enough to dislike for her provincialism and complaining becomes sympathetic when we're allowed to see her honesty at last. Maggie Smith is always fantastic as is Judy Dench. I did have to get over the image of Bill Nighy as an aging rockstar in Love, Actually but he's good enough to pull it off. And Dev Patel and his mom are great, too. I've already watched this a couple times and I'm sure I'll watch it many more.",1420156800,,701,4.318181818181818

4880946,5,B005S9EJ14,"My goodness, with almost 3,000 reviews at the time of this writing I have a feeling I have very little `new stuff' to add to the discussion here.  I am glad though that this movie does have that many reviews because that means that many have seen it and by the looks of it, the majority have enjoyed it as much as I have.  Yes, there are a few that did not like it but that just goes to show you the diversity in taste we have and lucky for us there is something for everyone out there.

I won't go into any plot details other than to state that this is the story of a group of elderly British subjects who find they cannot afford retirement in their home country so they take a chance and go to India.  The movies is filled with several of my favorite English actors and since I am about the age of most of the cast I was able to identify quite well.

The film does have its serious side, but overall in could be classified as a light, if slightly off center, comedy.  There are some truly funny scenes and conversations in this film as well as some very serious discussions and problems.  I thought that many of the problems these folks faced were quite typical of all people entering their retirement years.

I have watched this film about six times now and enjoy it as much now as when I first watched it.

This selection of retirees faces problems that will be familiar to their real-life counterparts...money, aging, loneliness, deteriorated husband-wife relationships, or just `who am I ?` and `what should I do with what remains of my life ?`
Set in colorful, hectic, and humorous India the stress of the situations is softened...

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Dame Judi Dench leads an all-star cast in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, a sweet-natured film about British seniors in India, which falls down on some wince-inducing clichs and British retirees travel to India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in very unexpected and lovely ways, as we find out about a disparate group of elderly Londoners find themselves ready to start a new phase of their lives and after reading a brochure for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur which caters to the elderly, they all book passage especially since the hotel also pays for their travel expenses there. Newly widowed Evelyn Greenslade [Dame Judi Dench] is on her own for the first time in forty-one years; high judge Graham Dashwood [Tom Wilkinson] abruptly quits his firm to return to the place where he spent his memorable early years; Douglas [Bill Nighy] and Jean [Penelope Wilton] Ainslie cant afford to live on pensions in England but hope a fresh start in India will mend their lifeless marriage; Madge Hardcastle [Celia Imrie] is on the lookout for rich, available men; her male counterpart Norman Cousins [Ronald Pickup] wants desperately to recapture some of his lost youth; and bigoted Muriel Donnelly [Dame Maggie Smith] needs a hip replacement but can only afford one performed in India and of course as usual, gets all the best lines. Greeted by the affable but hopelessly over-his-head proprietor Sonny Kapoor [Dev Patel], the Britishers are shocked by their less than luxurious accommodations but are soon off on their own individual adventures.

Ol Parkers screenplay, which was based on the novel by Deborah Moggach, and is full of nice predictable characters and situations, but its familiarity doesnt really matter when in the hands of such a talented cast of star character actors, and the Jaipur location adds colour and vivacity to their own discoveries about the country and about themselves. The film is barely long enough to give each of these marvellous talents their own individual stories, and some, like Tom Wilkinsons Graham and his sad search for a lost love or Bill Nighys Douglas and his yearning for Evelyn, could have used more fleshing out to have increased the audiences emotional responses to their ultimate fates. Even so, the film delivers in spades as director John Madden manages just enough slice-of-life touches to buoy up the screenplays expected twists and turns. At first, the younger generations subplot, represented by Dev Patels Sonny and his sweetheart Sunaina played by Tena Desae, and seems trite and uninteresting, but even its banal resolution is rather joyous and fitting in context of the other stories going on around it. Throughout, director John Madden instils a joyous sense of discovery about the movie that makes one eager to jump from story to story to see how each is progressing.

How can one single out any of these great actors for individual praise? Yes, Dame Maggie Smith as usual steals every scene shes given, and her characters transformation as she finds a purpose for her life is truly the films most rewarding story, but thats not to slight Judi Denchs no nonsense handling of Evelyns first taste of rather terrifying freedom or Penelope Wiltons continual harangues about the unsightly conditions and the deplorable differences between India and England. The men are wonderful, too, as Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy individually find some peace for their lives. Among this celebrated company, Dev Patel might seem a bit overwhelmed at the stars around him, but he gives an ingratiating performance that will likely be much admired.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films 2.35:1 theatrical aspect ratio is faithfully reproduced in a stunning 1080p encoded image transfer. Its an absolutely scrumptious transfer filled with gorgeous colour thats deeply saturated but never overdone, and contrast that has been brought to perfection. Flesh tones look natural and are extremely appealing. There really isn't anything negative to say about this sterling transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix gives a full rich and awesome aural experience to the listener especially for a film with somewhat small intentions. There are several wonderfully entertaining uses of ambient sounds in the fronts and rears, especially finding birds flocking and flittering in one of the hotel rooms is a great aural joke, and care has been taken to give the entire soundstage the feel of crowded, busy Indian streets. Dialogue is always easily discernible and is mostly located in the centre channel, plus theres a bit of directional dialogue near the end of the film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Welcome to the Real Best Exotic Marigold Hotel [2012] [1080p] [3:00] Watching John Madden describe how they cast the hotel and hear the actors explain how great a location it was to shoot at. We also hear brief interviews with writer Ol Parker, and stars Dev Patel, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie, and Ronald Pickup about their characters and how they fit into the films story.

Special Feature: Casting Legends [2012] [1080p] [4:00] The director and the younger cast kick off this feature by explaining how great it was to work with such well-known and seasoned theatrical cast, followed by the older actors praising the relatively new actors. It also allows Dev Patel to enthuse about the living legends in the cast, seconded by director John Madden and writer Ol Parker. Dame Judi Dench praises Dev Patel in return and also gives credit to John Maddens direction in this 4minute piece.

Special Feature: Trekking to India: Life is Never the Same [2012] [1080p] [3:00] No, this feature which is not about how the cast and crew made their way to India, it quickly features the actors explaining the beautiful culture shock of going to India for the first time. We also get featured stars like Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith praising production designer Alan Macdonald who took the dilapidated hotel in Jaipur and added touches to make it another character in the fantastic brilliant film.

Special Feature: Behind the Story: Lights, Colours and Smiles [2012] [1080p] [3:00] Let the footage begin. This one analytically breaks down the themes of the film via cast and crew interviews and clips. It also features brief interviews with director John Madden, writer Ol Parker, and stars Dev Patel, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie, and Ronald Pickup about their characters and how they fit into the films story.

Special Feature: Tuk Tuk Travels [2012] [1080p] [1:00] No, this feature is not filled with anecdotes about the cast and crew's Tuk Tuk travels while in India for the 2012 film. Instead, it features the director briefly explaining how efficient the Tuk Tuks are in the packed Indian city streets.

Finally, there is something satisfying and refreshing about little films like this, that don't focus so much on a complex plot, but tell an emotional and genuinely heartfelt story about likeable characters that are easy to connect with. That's exactly the type of film that 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' is. You will not only walk away entertained with a warm smile on your face, but you'll actually have an upbeat and positive perspective on life. I dare say that no geriatric comedy has ever been this entertaining. The video and audio qualities of this release are strong, but could have used a little push toward perfection. Sadly, it falls victim to the Indie Gods and only features a handful of very generic extras. Luckily, experiencing the movie itself is more than satisfying enough. Special features would not have been a crucial selling point on a film like this. If you need a breath of fresh, so look no further, 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' is in my mind the most have Blu-ray as it is such a beautiful fantastic film that is character driven, which makes for a totally brilliant film and was robbed of any kind of OSCAR for everyone involved with this film. A lovely, life-affirming film that proves its never too late for a fresh start in life. Very Highly Recommended!

4881124,5,B005S9EJ14,This is an enjoyable movie.  It takes you through the highs and lows of British retired life in India from different outlooks.  I love the movie and the characters in it.  Not just because they are great actors but because they make you forget this is a movie and make you a part of their lives.  You get to see those who have a sunny outlook on life and when given lemons truly make lemonade.  You get to see those who are disgruntled with the hand life has dealt them and are determined to be miserable and make everyone they come in contact with miserable too.  You become a part of this mismatched family and learn to love each and every character.  Warm and entertaining.,1412726400,,676,4.36

4881175,5,B005S9EJ14,"This is one of my favorite films in many years. It has a simple message: Life is a joyful thing. But the expression of that message has an exquisite complexity that comes from the range of fascinating characters making that discovery. They are a group of aging but still spirited and spunky folks looking for a wondrous, exciting place to spend their golden years--and drawn by the rich promises of an exotic locale--the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India. It is not what the brochure makes it out to be, and from the moment they set foot on the place, their experience is the stuff of comedy. What makes this film great, however, is that the comedy is subtle and realistic, not overdone slapstick. The proprietor of the hotel really IS trying his best to provide an outstanding experience--he just doesn't have much in the way of resources to work with. He's out of money, out of building materials, out of plumbing supplies, out of fresh food, and out of nearly everything except compassion and humor, which he has in abundance. Remarkably, that turns out to be enough. Here are folks who were seeking to escape life--and they find themselves plunged back in headfirst. We watch this intrepid little band evolve from a group of shy and hesitant explorers who feel out of their depth into assured and indeed courageous folk heroes, eager to take life in without missing a moment. The film has excellent dialogue--true, rich, sometimes biting. Some scenes are hysterically funny, some so touching it's hard to hold back the tears. We watch these people struggle with new and (for them) strange foods, indigestion, unusual (sometimes door-free) accommodations, fear of dying, difficult (in one case, impossible) relationships, and death itself. We see them at first afraid to set foot out of their hotels, and then finding their footing, interacting with the Indian people, making purchases, applying for jobs, seeking romance, exploring the nightlife, and taking in the sensory kaleidoscope of India. The acting company is superb, headed by Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, and Maggie Smith--all of whom are in rare form. Dev Patel, as the young, appealing, and far-over-his-head hotel manager gives a standout performance that is understated and spot on. It is impossible not to cheer for his wonderful philosophy of life--""In the end, everything will be all right. So if it is not all right, it is not the end."" I knew the moment I saw this film for the first time that I would buy it--and see it many times again. It is uplifting in the best sense of that word. We the viewers truly are transformed watching it, just as the characters are transformed through their rare and beautiful experience. Don't miss it. Unlike so many films that go for repetitious, obvious, and tired one-liners, this is a genuine comedy--of epic, indeed Shakespearean, proportion.",1411344000,,2866,4.935817805383023

Dame Judi Dench gives her usual outstanding performance as do Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and the other guests at the hotel.
The cinematography of India is delightful and the two primary young Indian people in the story portray the roles they are supposed to play and their conflicts of emotion with the rules of society in a slightly comical but very believable way that draws you into their lives just as much as the
roles played by the older hotel guests. The story has great depth without being melancholy. In short,if you don't watch it, you are depriving yourself of a very delightful few hours of outstanding entertainment.",1408406400,,786,4.581560283687943

Judy Dench, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith give wonderful performances in this film.  The story concerns the lives of several retirees who all go to India to live less expensively and end up this this hotel. They are initially under- whelmed by it.  As the character of each person unfolded, the movie became more interesting and invoked many different emotions.  Even though most of the characters are over 60, there are young lovers in the cast which makes the story even more interesting.

Like Moonstruck, Bread and Tulips, Tortilla Soup, Love Actually, Strictly Ballroom, Barefoot in the Park, Sunday in New York, etc., this is a film that is full of likeable characters and is both poignant and visually stunning.

4881388,4,B005S9EJ14,"This is such a good film. Others have spoken much on the issues presented of getting older, feeling obsolete, a bit frightened, as well as the feelings toward spouses, deceased and living, that went unspoken. It was awesome to see the courage of this group, who for the most part, as Evelyn said, not only survived, but thrived. I love love LOVE Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, and they were excellent here,  though they seem to have a bit of pattern by now to many of their roles, Smith as sharp tongued and witty, Dench as motherly and warm. As a total Downton Abbey fan, Maggie Smith was not far here from Dowager Countess Crawley, but my goodness, Penelope Wilton, as a shrewish, bitter woman here, was worlds away from the strong and compassionate Isobel Crawley. At least with distant familial intermarrying, you don't have to change the monograms!

 I think it's a little unfortunate that the only character that refused to embrace her new surroundings was Wilton's character. We can plainly see that her prison is of her own making, yet I am sure it is true that a place like Jaipur might be too difficult, in  many ways, for many people, and that wouldn't make them bad. To see Maggie Smith's character sitting on her hospital bed, exhausted, in pain, when she says, ""I want to go home,"" hurt my heart. I loved her emotional and physical recovery. Another scene that broke my heart is when she is pouring out her heart to the woman who isn't understanding a word she is saying, and to see the emotional connection on the face of the woman ""who no one else will even acknowledge.""

I had to put aside my American sensibilities with the scenes with Sunaina and her brother, when he was telling her what to do and listening on her phone. I know it's a male dominant culture but I still wish she had stood up to him and told him to bug off. It surprised me though that Sonny's mother was as controlling of him as she was. It would have seemed more accurate with a daughter.

The tiny little things that bugged a little bit were when Evelyn saw Graham in the swing and just walked away. There was no blood or wounds, and you can't tell by looking a someone from feet away, whether they are living. He could have been asleep, he could have been unconscious and in need of medical help. Not the medical help from Sonny, who had problems telling living from dead. Sonny was awesome. The other thing that I wasn't sure felt very accurate was Graham's telling practically everyone that he was gay, even as a reply to ""where are you going?"" which seemed very odd, and not one person had  a moment's problem with it, even though he had only known these people a couple of weeks. It was great to see that acceptance but not something anyone can count on, especially I would think, amongst older people. I also wondered, since Graham apparently planned to die in India, why it didn't bother him to make friends with these people, knowing he might drop dead in front of them, and not care at all about they might feel about that? Also Manoj's, whose life he just dropped back into out of the blue, unannounced and uninvited, and then drops dead. I suppose one could also argue that the pursuit of Evelyn by the other guy, I forget his name, was rather rushed, seeing as his wife wasn't even at the airport yet, but on the other hand, sometimes there isn't all the time in the world.

But these are little picks. This is truly an excellent movie and has much to say about the human condition, caring about others and living life, no matter the age, or what your mother wants.",1406764800,,3565,4.457055214723926

The movie is captivating, an answer to our dormant fears.

Every human being is apprehensive of reaching our most vulnerable years and live within a culture that does not respect, love or thank the elderly for their legacy of experience and wisdom... in INDIA, they have life in real perspective!

The acting is superb and it is a delight to find our favorite talents, weaved into the script with great finesse. Evelyn played by Judi Dench does a fantastic job as recently widowed who has to deal with overcoming loneliness and jobs she never had to do before. The conversation about technology is priceless.

Muriel, played by Maggie Smith is another excellent choice for playing a woman having to face with health issues, diversity, finally overcoming reservations and becoming part of a new world. As usual, Maggie Smith is superb, with one single facial expression the actress can write a book!

Now to review the movie, all of these older people move to Italy because it's to be a less expensive way to live. They are lured in by a certain hotel just for older folks. First of all, nice to know these people on budgets had the money to go to Italy.
They of course end up at the same place and their interaction begins. It is actually a pretty great movie though I found it slow at times.

4881615,5,B005S9EJ14,"In this day and age of terrorism, newsflashes of the depressing variety, and hype and panic, a story about our ability to reach out to other humans across cultures to form a bond of understanding and acceptance brings a sense of hope. This story features geriatric characters who in their late years explore and take chances by leaving their England to retire to India.  Those familiar with history will not lose the irony of the situation the characters find themselves in, needing to retire to a 3rd world former colony.  Despite the age of the main characters, there is nothing rigid or constrained about the warmth of feeling that they display, as each finds a peace of their own. The subtle English humour is eloquent in its understatement, making various scenes more poignant, especially with Dame Judy Dench's commanding performances.  If nothing else, I hope future viewers come away with a better appreciation of the diversity and richness of humanity, underscored by our similarities as we strive to achieve our dreams, whatever our age.  I've deliberately avoided revealing plot subtleties; I hope you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was, and come away with a sense of hope that there is a place in the world for every one of us.

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a wonderfully told story of a group of Englishmen and women drawn to India in order to have a dignified and more comfortable old age. It is the story of the lessons they learn and teach. Beautfilly done!",1398643200,,434,4.493670886075949

The game seemed to be to infer the thoughts and motives of each character from the short snatches of language and behavior scattered throughout. This wasn't hard and was kind of fun. Nevertheless, many questions remained and left me with a sense of having leafed through a stranger's photo album, appreciating the beauty of some of the pictures, but with no real understanding of who and what I was seeing.  Despite all that, I enjoyed the film. For me, the real pleasure lay in watching this collection of marvelous actors...act. This was enough to justify my rating.",1398470400,,678,4.844827586206897

I'm an expat living in Central America so I could relate to these retirees moving to a foreign country for affordable lifestyle.  I tried giving a copy of this DVD to my oldest son for his 45th birthday...wasn't well accepted.

basically, the movie has a deep story within each frame, each frame is speaking about some parts of life and how we struggle sometimes to cope w the reality the life reality is, with others and with our environment. The stories are made vibrant by the different characters each of whom have their own struggles, history, reality, hopes, their own sort of inner search for ??

There is not a moment or frame wasted, and when it comes all together, it becomes a deeply philosophical take on life, growing old, our loves, risk, and everything you can think of.

The humor did not hold though and the second half of the movie was all serious stuff. The name of the movie and the trailer suggest that it was a comedy. It is based on the 2004 novel These Foolish Things, by Deborah Moggach. Wiki describes it as a comedy-drama, which it is. In two separate parts.  Should have been better. Maybe a screenwriter let down. We will hunt down the original book and give it a go.",1396828800,,570,4.181818181818182

Maybe because I am 70 years old and can relate to the problems that pop up once you are elderly and live on a fixed income.

4881711,5,B005S9EJ14,"I saw this movie for the first time on my fourth trip to India. The acting is very good, and the story line is heartwarming and also sad in some parts. It shows India like it is without overhyping some of the parts other movies tend to overdo, like the abject poverty throughout the country. India truly is a place of wonder and it's easy to miss a lot of it due to the poverty and trash everywhere. You have to look past that and see the culture and the people along with the thousands of years of history to begin to understand the country. The movie focuses on the retirement lives of several ex-pats from Britain, but they could be from anywhere. My absolute favorite line from the movie is ""Everything will be alright in the end, and if it is not alright, then it is not yet the end...""",1396137600,,791,4.245033112582782

The location shots in India are perfect, and pull you into the fray with ease, and give you a feeling you are actually there with the characters.

Not just the retired folk who had come from Britain, but the Indians with whom their lives intertwined also. It had its moments of sadness, but for the most part it was such an exuberant depiction of life in a chaotic ramshackle hotel and the surrounding environment!

4881762,2,B005S9EJ14,"I'm a big fan of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith so I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Sounded like a great story but what a disappointment.

Except for the (as usual) stellar performances of Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, I thought the movie was boring and pretentious. It seemed the actors were merely reading their lines throughout this movie. There was no emotion conveyed, at least not enough for me to get into the story and forget that it was just a movie. When that happens, I love it. In this case, I never did get past the ""acting"" throughout.

I also thought the story line about Tom Wilkinson being involved with a Indian man sexually, many years before and then that man ending up marrying an Indian woman in later life,didn't ring true. I don't think that would be in line with traditional Indian values and that this man in all likelihood would have remained an outcast and shunned by his family. Not accepted as a husband to this woman; in spite of her being able to accept and live with, his past.

This movie could have been so much better. It had potential. I hope someone else makes a movie about older people looking for a new lease on life and taking a chance on trying something totally new. It's a great idea that I think would appeal to a lot of people and not just the older crowd.",1394841600,,1317,4.389344262295082

Each actor/actress was the perfect fit for the film, different from the others in their own way. And I think one of the highlights was the young actor who plays the hotel owner. I am amazed at how he could stand alone as a great character among such mature and seasoned British actors and actresses.

How often can you see this extraordinary cast together? Oh sure, at one time before they were famous Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were roommates, or shared a dressing room.

When ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" first reached the USA I rushed to see it with a paying audience. From the reaction those folks loved the movie as much as I did. Now I received a DVD of it last evening, which I have already watched twice. There is so much going on, in a good way, that a subsequent viewing let me find a whole new set of things to enjoy.

Besides the seven lead performers from the UK, this film is a marvelous show case for emerging performers who also deserve to be stars. A couple of years ago after seeing this on screen I remember walking out of the cinema thinking it was like ""American Graffiti"" of ""MASH"" in terms of introducing me to talent I wanted to watch develop more on-screen.",1394064000,,937,4.404624277456647

They set off for retirement to a beautifully advertised resort in India that they arrive to find has been vastly over-rated by its enthusiastic and visionary young hotel manager - and for whom nothing is impossible.

The story of a group of individuals in their 'golden years' finding themselves and each other is well told by a stunning cast that is a who's who of UK acting royalty. The icing on the cake is the sheer quality of a brilliant supporting cast, including the wonderful Dev Patel. MINOR SPOILERISH THING: The screenwriter, Ol Parker (age 53) may have simply been taking the idea from the original novel, but the one ludicrous flaw in the screenplay involved Ronald Pickup's Norm and Diana Hardcastle's Carol. After Carol and Norm eventually spend a night together, Carol tells Madge that she had switched his Viagra for aspirin and that he 'went all night on two aspirin'... Really? A 74-year-old-man couldn't tell the difference between the unique shape and colour combo of Viagra and simple aspirin? Really? Go all night? Even if he could, a post menopausal woman of her age probably couldn't, and more importantly, wouldn't even want to. Going all night is kid's stuff. Sorry Ol, but that was just plain silly.

4881857,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie has fine performances by Dames Judy Dench and Maggie Smith as two of the characters who eventually come to grips with their very different lives in India, a culture that is very unlike that of living in England. The two men characters adapt for the positive as well. One had lived in India much earlier in his life and had left there with a secret of a partially unfulfilled life longing. The movie progression leads to a satisfying ending for this man.
There is an unhappy female who has come to India with her husband. She is unhappy on arrival and continues until she returns to England. Her husband remains at the hotel and is well-satisfied.
Several of the characters are played by actors that also have important roles in a PBS serial. This overlap produced intellectual dissonance in me for the first half of the movie. I guess that there must be a limited number of English actors of this age range.

4881894,5,B005S9EJ14,"This Anglo-Indian movie has perhaps the best older British actors playing characters making major changes in the twilight of their lives by moving to Jaipur, India.  Judi Dench plays a widow whose late husband put her in such debt that she not only had to move to a less expensive place but find a job.  The couple played by Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton (Mrs. Crawley of Downton Abbey) lost their savings, at least temporarily, when he lent all their savings to their daughter for a start-up business.  While he is open to new experiences and new people, she is bitter and unwelcoming to lifes adventures and questioning the continuation of their 40 year marriage.  Ronald Pickups character is looking for a woman to spend the rest of his life withor at least a few nights, while Celia Imries character came to find a wealthy husband.  Maggie Smith plays a retired housekeeper/caretaker who needs a hip transplant and can get one in India much quicker and cheaper than in England; she just doesnt like Indians.  Tom Wilkersons character suddenly retired as a high court judge and came to India where he was raised to find his friend and only love from 40 years before.

They all saw the advertisement of a beautiful hotel in Jaipur, India catering to seniors.  Instead, they find an ancient, crumbling hotel not ready for them, run by a young dreamer and eternal optimist who inherited the hotel from his father, also a dreamer.  His mother arrives bringing a practicality that tries to crush his dreams and separate him from his true love as well as his work.  Dev Patel as the proprietor is a wonderful actor who holds his own against the scions of British acting.

There is sadness, breakup, and surprise developments as some grow while others don't make it.  A lot of true life is shown as well as the colorfulness of India.  Thus, the movie is a character study, a travelogue, and a lesson on great acting without realizing it.  One can buy into the characters and be absorbed into the story.  This little film is truly worth watching.",1388707200,,2042,4.680672268907563

Once they've all moved to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India, forget about their ages--it's all fun and drama. It's a little corny and a little predictable, but my husband and I were laughing so hard it didn't matter.

4881902,5,B005S9EJ14,"Better with each viewing. Very different from what I'm used to watching. Thought provoking. Probably life altering in my case. Clever and cute humor, gut-wrenching sadness, and tremendously uplifting - and all thrown together in a very different land and culture.
If this movie did not receive an Academy Award, then there is something very wrong with the judges.
Most movies I love have at least some part or parts that I fast forward thru. Not so with BEMH. There is not one moment I am even tempted to skip over.",1388361600,,515,4.670329670329671

4881904,4,B005S9EJ14,"Cute story that we did not see when it first came out. Like British movies or sitcoms on PBS then you will like this movie.

4881906,5,B005S9EJ14,"On the surface, this looks like a travelog, or ""fish out of water"" story, dropping staid British elderly into a new and strange environment with ensuing hijinks.  It has more layers than that, though.  It's a commentary on racism, both domestic and imported.  It's a comment on class.  It's a comment on optimism in the face of something that seems at first impossible.  And finally it's a story about how everybody has value, something to contribute, something at which they shine.  Even if they are elderly, or perhaps a lunatic.  Judi Dench is utterly charming.  Maggie Smith plays a deeply bigoted, scared, insular woman who discovers compassion and humanity, and ultimately saves the day.  It's worth watching just to see these fine actors perform, but the story and script are also wonderful.",1388102400,5,798,4.984848484848484
4881907,5,B005S9EJ14,"Best for the over 40 crowd, although there is a subplot with young people that is delightful. The actors are stellar. This is a movie I will re-watch.",1388102400,,150,4.392857142857143
4881908,5,B005S9EJ14,"My husband was delighted to receive his copy of this great film.  The package arrived quickly and in the usual unlabled wrapper so no hints were obvious.  The dvd was in the typical posterboard sleeve and shipped in a buble wrap envelope.  The corners of the dvd were slightly bent from handling.  It might have been nice to have put it in a hard plastic case for protection.  As always, Amazon did a great job.",1388016000,,411,4.426666666666667
4881909,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie was quite a surprise.  The narrative is compelling, introducing a rich set of retirement-aged characters at the inflection points in their lives where monetary, relational or health crises demand that they revisit how they will live their futures. In response to their changing circumstances, each decides to expatriate to India to retire to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  The proprietor is an inexperienced second-generation hotelier who has taken over his late father's dilapidated property and intends to raise it to glory by conceiving a scheme to ""outsource"" care for the unwanted elderly from developed countries.  To attract guests, he oversells the property.  His guests arrive to discover a property in disrepair which is nothing like the property pictured in the online brochure.  The balance of the movie is dedicated to guests adapting to life in India and the relationships which evolve between them.  The acting is superb, the scenery captivating and the plot bittersweet.  It is a good way to spend a few hours.",1387929600,,1039,5.22289156626506

The film has an excellent cast, who seem to enjoy their roles, and it's very much an ensemble of amazing actors working together.  I especially loved how the color and vibrancy of India as a culture and a county is clearly showcased without it being done in a patronizing way.  In summary:  seven seniors from England journey to India for various reasons, and all of them come away with something beautiful and life-affirming.

4881999,4,B005S9EJ14,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was surprised at how much it stayed on my mind afterward. It's not a great film -- a couple of the plot elements don't work or aren't developed, and I found Dev Patel's character as annoying as he was endearing. But it's a very good movie nonetheless. It left me smiling. Perhaps it was my weakness for grand old hotels, even when they're in a state of shabbiness, and for out-of-the-way places; the movie captures India in all its chaos and color. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel follows a group of aging Brits as they try a low-budget retirement in a run-down Indian hotel. The acting is first rate. I'm used to seeing Judi Dench playing formidable characters, perhaps because of her role in the latest James Bond flicks. Here, it's a pleasure to see her on a very human scale as a recent widow, struggling to build a new life, relying on her basic optimism and humanity to see her through. Bill Nighy I associate with somewhat satanic characters. Here he's great as a bumbling, funny, good-hearted ex-civil servant adjusting as best he can to a modest retirement. Tom Wilkinson is wonderful as a high-ranking judge who returns to India to find a lost love and perhaps make amends for the past. But it is the great Maggie Smith who stealthily takes over as movie goes on. This is fine, feel-good entertainment for grown-ups.",1382227200,,1361,4.651452282157677

This is a sensitive, FUN, bittersweet, intriguing story about such an eclectic group of characters who, in such a strange way, all complement each other.  There is the lonely widow who is searching so hard for love.  There is the unhappy couple who have been pretending for so long that they are right for each other....and many others who play against a backdrop of Indian culture which is fascinating.  This is a rich, complex story that is too multi-layered to explain here.  I only hope you take the time to watch it because we want to encourage wonderfully written films like this from Hollywood!

For me, the biggest strength of the movie was the contemporary Indian cultural setting of the movie.  But on the negative side, I felt that this movie over-reached, in the sense of each character stretching the limits of plausibility and too much happening to them in too short a span of time.

4882021,3,B005S9EJ14,"Since the success of Slumdog Millionaire, the film industry has started to realise that India is a big and potentially exciting setting for films.
The best things about Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are the setting, in a romantic ramshackle picturesque old building in India, and the fact that it takes older people as its lead characters. We are living in an age of old age, with more old people than ever before, and oldies want to be centre stage! Oldies are interesting, oldies still have strong feelings and passions, oldies even have good ideas.
However, the film's entertainment is really on a fairly lightweight level. The storylines are not very gripping and the film is marred by the inclusion of a completely ridiculous homosexual romance. It is just not believable that two teenage boys who had a scuffle or a pash when they were 18 should meet again after fifty years and fall into each other's arms like true-lovers. The fact that they have both been married with children and are now grandfathers makes it even more ridiculous!

I especially wanted to see this movie because seeing ""A Passage to India"" in the 80s gave me a lifelong appreciation for the beautiful areas of India that Americans seldom see.

4882076,5,B005S9EJ14,"It's probably my age and the economy showing, but this was a great movie about people retiring on a very limited income to India.  Each retiree has a story line, and the young owner of this Indian hotel for the elderly has his own story line.  And the story does show how little many countries care about their older folks compared to how they are revered in many Asian cultures such as India.  I loved it.  I've watched it 4 or 5 times since I bought it.  I like India.  So it appeals to me.  I hate to say any more because I don't want to spoil the movie.

I loved that the characters, inspite of their age, continue to travel , enjoy life and explore its possibilities. Like me, they look honestly at their relationships and address issues that must be addressed. I enjoyed that they went to India and as a viewer  I had a chance to see different parts of a country I visited 12 years ago. Additionally, I had a chance to learn more about its culture. The storyline was very much to my liking!  The review I had read about the movie previous to seeing it was right on target!",1377820800,,682,4.404761904761905

4882105,5,B005S9EJ14,"This is definitely a ""coming of age"" film for those of us 60ish plus.  I had no idea what to expect when I saw the title ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" come up on HBO's list of movies...but with Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Judi Dench I knew it wasn't something to take lightly.  I was hooked by the time that fabulous score took off in the airport lounge, and I was soaring right with it.  The pacing of the film, the score, the photography, the casting--superb.

My hat is off especially to Penelope Wilton, who gave a pitch-perfect portrayal of a ""Brit control-freak"" barely holding it together with that British stiff upper lip.  I suppose the term ""seriocomic"" could be used to describe her performance, since this is definitely not a tense, dramatic film--but the way she was able to craft her character, who finally came to terms with who she had been/was being, and was able to let go, was emotionally so satisfying to feel and watch.

At age 67, I could absolutely imagine myself in every moment of this film--and wished I was.  I have mentioned it to friends who are under 50 who do not seem interested in seeing it--so perhaps it speaks more to those of us who have gone beyond trying to succeed in this success-driven society, living inauthentic lives to a greater or lesser extent.

I have watched Marigold Hotel at least half a dozen times and will no doubt continue to watch it many times more.  It feeds my soul.  Thank you to all of you who made it.  A mitzvah.",1376697600,5,1480,4.4646840148698885

All of the actors were perfect in their roles.  Maggie Smith brings her crotchety self that she does so well to a perfect ending that I won't give away.

4882154,5,B005S9EJ14,"This film is a definite crowd pleaser.  Its message that you are never too old to find yourself definitely resonates.  The central plot concerns a group of British seniors who for various reasons, some financial some personal, relocate to a dilapidated retirement community in India.  They don't know what they'll find but some rediscover themselves or have an epiphany in their adopted land.  The film is funny and at turns poignant.  The film also contains a number of plot twists that are wholly unexpected.  There are a multitude of characters, plot strands, and backstories here but they are adeptly handled as a cohesive whole by director John Madden who previously helmed the Oscar winning ""Shakespeare in Love"".  The main characters are portrayed by the crme de la crme of British geriatric heavyweights so you expect no less than perfection and that's what you get.  The film is deliberately paced but not slow so viewers should allow for it to gain momentum for maximum satisfaction.  I highly recommend this film with little to no reservations.",1374883200,4,1055,5.017241379310345

4882162,3,B005S9EJ14,"I put the video in and was confronted with several 20th Century Fox ads for their Blu-Ray movies that lasted about 5 minutes. I clicked the Play button and the video stopped. I had to start all over again with the ads for their movies. By that time I almost lost interest in watching the film. So, each time you want to view this video, you have to watch the same ads over again: no skipping ahead to avoid them. Annoying to the point that I won't buy any other videos distributed by 20th Century Fox....

The film has been described well already. It is an interesting look at those having to make decisions as to where to live when life diminishes money and health. The choice of the internet ad for an Exotic Indian Hotel is a typical overblown description of its true condition, and each person reacts differently to life in India.

The characters are not all fully developed, but one man does have a particular interest in re-visiting his old neighborhood -- which has changed completely. We see his anguish and a later reaction, thus making his story more interesting. Maggie Smith does a particularly good representation of those who only go to India for cheaper surgery than in England, and her part is well presented all through the film. Her role changes from one aspect to an ending which is a surprise.

The film is one you want to say is ""wonderful."" However, it almost glosses over too many characters who cannot all have their stories developed. Dench portrays a widow who decides to ""go it alone"" instead of moving in with her children, and I waited for a better storyline than quickly finding a job -- and then she almost flounders through the rest of the film. As always, a good performance, but not up to the par we expect.

The young owner of the hotel and his mother have a more involved and interesting portrayal of the traditions of Indian families, and he is the ""best"" character in the film, IMO.

It is a film for those who enjoy a rather slow-moving peek into seniors' lives who must find a less expensive way of living. The busy streets of the city are what you can see/hear on any very short travel video. I can recommend it with reserve, but don't expect an exciting adventure or even an intensive look into each character's personality or the changes that may or may not happen to them. I happen to like this type of film, but it isn't for everyone. The actors are fine, but it lacks substance. Again, just my opinion.",1374796800,,2448,4.492134831460674

""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is fantastic. The writing is great and the characters are all lovable. This is a movie that is very easy to get lost in. I imagine this become a TBS weekend classic.

If you like the premise and you know you like the cast then you will most likely enjoy this movie. The really surprising thing to me is that I feel this movie can become popular beyond its expected audience. The main cast is definitely older, but there is no ready for the audience to follow suit.

This movie genuinely made me laugh, and I am sure it will make some viewers cry. The characters all feel genuine and all have a realistic feel to them. Each character is more dynamic than you expect them to be and the problems that each character faces are ageless.

4882174,2,B005S9EJ14,"I was excited about this movie when I saw the high ratings it got and noted the star-studded cast that it boasted.  I was surprised I had never heard of it before.  I ordered the movie and watched it when it arrived and it was okay, but I can see why it never really reached great heights.

The general premise was good, but I was a little disappointed that the biggest message of the movie seemed to be, not simply overcoming difficulties and thriving in a hard situation (which is the way the film advertises itself), but instead that true happiness is found from casting off rules and expectations.  Many of the moral dilemmas of the film were, I felt, resolved in the wrong direction.

I suppose ""to each his own"" when it comes to moral interpretations, but I also felt like the acting was just a bit hollow.  Judi Dench does very well for about the first half of the film, and after that I really struggled to understand what she was doing and what the significance of her character was.  Nighy does a fair but not amazing job, and so do several of the others.  Maggie Smith does a good job pretty consistently through the film, but even the epiphany of her character seems just a bit under-developed.

The film has some pretty good moments -- some genuine good humor and a few poignant lessons (""Everything will turn out okay in the end.  So if things aren't okay, it must not be the end."").  On the whole, though, I still came away from it predominantly disappointed.  It was a movie with a lot of potential that took a few wrong turns.

4882209,5,B005S9EJ14,"Judy Dench and Maggie Smith at their very best. Dev Patel as the ambitious young hotel owner.  A star studded cast, and they deliver.

Seven elderly Britishers, facing difficulties adjusting to retirement at home, decide to start a new life at a most wonderful hotel for senior citizens, located in Jaipur, India. The hotel is old and unusual by western standards.  Most of the room don't even have doors and the food is too spicy. The new guests have difficulties adjusting to their environment, but each copes in his or her own way.  Evelyn must take a job at a call center that caters to English businesses; Jean and Doug quarrel, Jean staying in the hotel and Doug exploring the sights of Jaipur; Graham has come to find the Indian boy who was his lover when they were in school together; Muriel overcomes her racism and becomes friends with her doctor and the hotel maid; Madge looks for a rich husband by trying to pass as Princess Margaret; Norman, trying to pick up well-to-do women, finds himself being introduced to 'Princess margaret.""  And the irrepressible Sunny attempts to save his hotel from his greedy brothers, who want to tear it down, and his love for a local girl from his mother, who wants an arranged marriage.

The manner in which the characters explore their own lives while interacting with the others weaves a heartwarming tale of life and love, joy and despair.  They each struggle to find answers, and in the end they succeed.

I suggested it to my high school students and they even loved it.  As one said, ""wow, they aren't any different than us...how is that?"" Come on, give it a try!",1372636800,,294,4.178571428571429
4882213,5,B005S9EJ14,"One of my favorite films I've seen this year is the charming, funny, and heartwarming treat THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, which contains a handful of my favorite actors working today.  The story is about seven retirement-age Brits, each for reasons of his or her own decide to answer an ad and relocate to India, to the posh/upscale (yet very affordable) Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which has been specifically geared for retirees.

There is Graham (Tom Wilkinson), on a mission to find a lost love; Doug and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton), who have lost most of their money in a bad investment in their daughter's online company; Muriel (Maggie Smith), a grouchy bigot who needs hip replacement surgery and can only get it right away in India; Evelyn (Judi Dench), a widow who feels she's lost her place in the world; Madge (Celia Imrie), on the hunt for a rich husband; and Norman (Ronald Pickup), the eternal skirt chaser who still fancies himself a ladies man even in his ""golden years"".

All seven meet on the way to India, and upon arrival realize that the hotel depicted in the ads/brochure is by far NOT the rundown, shabby, badly-in-need of repair former palace that lies before them - run by Sonny (the ever-brilliant Dev Patel), who has so much energy and so much heart, and is determined to do everything he can to get the money needed so he can restore the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (""Now with Guests!"" as the sign he soon puts out front reads) back to its former glory.

India, depicted as a patchwork of sound and noise and people - lots and LOTS of people - affects each of the seniors in a different way.  But each of them IS affected, most of them deeply, and the film is not only a love letter to India but also a love letter to the human spirit that lives - and can be rekindled - in us all, no matter how old we are or how far withdrawn from life we feel we've become.  Funny, enchanting, beautifully written and with a perfect cast, it's a film that will touch your heart without going overboard into sentiment.  A lovely, inspiring film.",1372636800,,2069,4.516042780748663

4882232,4,B005S9EJ14,"The story is somewhat predictable, with stereotypical characters but the whole is far greater than the sum of the parts. A delightful, whimsical, film that manages to balance humour with pathos and has a serious side too. There are some great one-liners that are both clever and funny.

As mentioned elsewhere, the collection of on-screen talent is impressive. It is good to see quality actors engaged in quality acting. Penelope Wilton succeeded in making me dislike and sympathise with her character; Bill Nighy played Bill Nighy yet again but rather well in my opinion; Maggie Smith had turned everything up to 11; Tom Wilkinson was great - especially during the cricket lesson and game in which there was a moment of great emotion where if you had blinked you missed it; and so on through the cast list.

One could get picky and criticise some parts of the characters and plot but overall it is a nice, quaint, comfortable film that entertains without being demanding whether by complicated story or unnecessary `realism'; well made and well acted.",1371859200,2,1052,4.937853107344632

I might add that I am around the age of the characters in this film, and while I have no desire to retire to India, I could and did entirely sympathize with them. I didn't hear a single false note and thought every character entirely believable in context. Maybe Maggie Smith overdid the insular Brit bigot early on - her attitude in the initial hospital scenes would not be accepted in any English hospital today - but she came around nicely as the film progressed.

The hustle and bustle on the Indian streets is typical ( I lived there for 18 years ) and so is the wheeler dealing of the hotel owner( Dev Patel who acted in Slumdog Millionaire) is also typical of the way business is conducted in India. It has everything fun humour family relationships and sadness in the movie well put together into a story and will probably do a lot for the Indian tourist trade.

A group of older British people go to India all with their own reasons and stay at the Exotic Marigold Hotel. Many of them have life changing experiences. Most of them decide to stay there after their trip is over.
  There was one line from the young manager of the Hotel that I will never forget: ""Things always work out in the end. So if things aren't all worked out, it's not the end!""",1369958400,,617,4.211864406779661

The hotel the movie is set in, is run down, but full of charm and it adds to the exotic setting of India. I especially liked Dame Judi Dench. She handles her life set backs with dignity and grace and does succeed in getting that second chance to be happy again. Loved the scenery and flavor of India.

4882297,4,B005S9EJ14,"I was prepared to hate this movie and watched it just to be agreeable for a change.  The teaser line about British pensioners in an Indian residence hotel seemed a setup for one cultural cliche after another.  Well, the cliches are certainly present, but before we condemn all cliche we should look at the origins of the word itself.  A 'cliche' was originally the term applied to recurrent patterns of words and letters in the early days of moveable type.  The printer would bind these familiar sequences together so they could be used entire. In essence a cliche was a cluster of words that was familiar through repetition - and therefore worthy of being kept available for frequent use.

In this case the familiar social issues (cliches) are in the hands of a super-star cast of characters who treat them with the respect - even reverence - they are due.  This is a movie about ordinary people being wholly ordinary in an extraordinary place.  As wise as it is witty, it's an evening well spent.",1369440000,2,998,4.668571428571428

She had been wanting to see it for several months and was very disappointed after watching it. The plot had some potential but never delivered.

4882312,5,B005S9EJ14,"How can a film starring Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and a cast of other superb British and Indian actors fail to be less than entertaining.  I must warn the would be viewer, however, that the movie title fails to live up to its name.  The hotel is far from the best and is only exotic in the sense it takes place in a dusty, small town in India.  The hotel also appears to be on the verge of financial collapse.  The young manager, played by the charming Dev Patel, does his utmost to keep up the appearances of this seemingly fourth rate business.

The would be guests complain about the hotel right from the very start.  Maggie Smith's character, who decides to stay at the hotel beause it is near a hospital that performs cheap and prompt hip replacement surgery, insists that only a British doctor may touch her.  Several of the others plan to use the Marigold hotel as a retirement home.  Tom Wilkinson hopes to find a former Indian lover there from whom there was an unfortunate break up.  Another couple decides to put an end to a 40 year marriage that apparently has lasted 35 years too long.

One of best aspects of Marigold Hotel is its gentle humor, much of which is related to the foibles of each of the guests.  One particularly funny scene concerns some items that one of the women desires to purchase from a street vendor.  One of the male guests gives some advice to the would be purchaser to prevent her from being cheated.  His advice fails badly.  There are also several lovely romantic moments in the film.  One of the joys of ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is that virtually everyone, by at the end of the film, unexpectedly finds what he or she was searching for.",1368835200,,1699,4.453074433656958

Dev Patel from SlumDog Millionaire is the bumbling businessman who wants to  outsource retirement to India. He has a hotel that he inherits from his dad and his brochures promise the British retirees retirement nirvana.
Obviously there are mishaps, complications and misunderstanding among the guests- all of them except a few are at sea,. Strangers struggling in an environment that is completely alien to them.
A widow ( Judi Dench) must find a job and so she does at a call center. Nighy - enjoys India but his  wife can't stand it. A racist woman must get rid of her fear of colored people and hospitals in India. Two lonely souls keep on looking for love in the wrong places. Even the young owner has parental issues stemming from his ownership of the hotel and with his girlfriend Tana Desae and his mother who wants him to give up his dreams and move in with her.

4882347,5,B005S9EJ14,"This is a quirky tale of a group of retirees who have decided to relocate sight unseen to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India.  Their journey begins with a brief synopsis of why each of them is leaving England and going to India.  Each story is funny, and people can relate to these people's situations.

Upon their arrival, culture shock sets in.  Some can accept it and some can not.  One of the characters, Muriel, played so adeptly by Maggie Smith, is prejudiced against Indians, so her injection into India provides many laughs.  Her remarks are priceless.  Muriel expresses what many people only feel and keep to themselves.

Upon their arrival, the guests are greeted by Dev Patel, the owner of the hotel.  He is the young actor who played the hero in Slumdog Millionaire. His comic gestures, timing, and hilarious welcome to the guests are a pleasure to watch.  He delivers funny lines with such seriousness that makes what he says even funnier.  His intentions are so good for these people, but he stumbles over his words, which makes his welcome even funnier.  Dev Patel is the best host/owner/manager of this establishment.

Patel's ""Welcome Dinner"" is hilarious.  His intentions are so pure and sincere, but his words are so funny.  He calls the hotel a place for ""the elderly and beautiful,"" and for people ""who are long in tooth"" and ""heard the chimes at midnight.""  Everyone is in shock.  The food is atrocious, but he prepared it lovingly with his most ""loyalest"" and best friend, Young Moossi.  When someone falls over at the table and gets crowded by the other guests, Dev Patel rushes through saying, ""Let me through.  My brother is a doctor!""  This comedic dinner doesn't get much better than this!

The entire cast is brilliant.  These actors are at the richest point in their careers, and it is a joy to watch them.  Each character has his or her reasons for going to this hotel, and their stories unfold most amusingly.  Each actor plays his or her part to perfection.  The casting was superb.  Everyone can relate to their situations.  The deadpan and the hysterical actions are extremely amusing.

I have watched this movie over and over because I discover something new every time I watch it.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to sympathize with the plight that seniors may face in retiring to a foreign country.  This is the best movie that has come along in a long time!

Let me say that the book, is much different from the movie but was just as enjoyable. As it seems to happen in Hollywood, the storyline was changed a lot, you have to look at them as two seperate things that have a few things in common. The movie is quite different from the book as far as the characters and even the story line, to an extent, but each has it's own charm and beauty. I loved them both and both make me want to visit India. If the Marigold Hotel did indeed exist, I think I could retire there and be happy.",1367193600,,677,4.022222222222222

They must know little about good film making!  I was very disappointed by the actors and everything else about this movie.  The fine actors appearing were completely wasted.  The young, silly, India male star was goofy and did a poor job running around all over the place, like a drunk neurotic.  The direction was limpid.  No plot was clear. There was little or nothing shown of Jaipur, India where the movie was shot. The many stars appeared tired and surprised to find themselves in this turkey! There was no Art Direction.  None of the hotel's guests were shown in their bedrooms, but always sitting in the rundown, weed-strewn courtyard.  Having to travel to India and appear to be living in a run-down old and trashy hotel must have surprised and shocked the skilled and excellent actors as much as the picture did for me.  What was the meaning of these old folks going to India in the first place?  Judy Dench was shown getting a job in a factory in Jaipur because she needed money!  An American can't just travel to India and get a job, thus displacing a citizen of India where there is vast unemployment.  The idea of making this absurd and boring movie was a disaster, and this film will not make money, even though it was made for peanuts in India.",1366675200,14,1396,4.566265060240964
4882374,5,B005S9EJ14,This is a wonderful story of aging and the impacts on a diverse group of Brits.  They choose to maximize their resources by moving to India to the hotel.

Let's sell beer and wine but, not sell lotto tickets, Let's sell ammo but not sell guns, let's take the utility knife blades off the shelf so people won't steal them and open packages in other parts of the store, but not stop anyone from carrying a pocket knife into the store and do the same thing.

4882393,4,B005S9EJ14,"I love this film, and the cast is outstanding -- Dame Judi Dench, Dame Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton.  Need I say more?  Maggie is vintage Maggie, playing a racist old woman who is forced to travel to India for a hip replacement.  Judi plays a vulnerable and sheltered woman whose husband has died after losing much of their life savings.  It was refreshing to see Judi play such a vulnerable character.  My last on-screen memory of her was Pride and Prejudice, in which she played Lady Catherine, a very cold character.  Penelope's character and her husband have also lost much of their life savings, after he gave it to their daughter to help her start a business.  As usual, Penelope does her best acting through facial expressions.  There are four other characters as well, but those three give the most commanding performances.  The film satisfied (and encouraged, strangely) my wanderlust, because it involves a group of British retirees who travel to India.  Also, it is bi-cultural in that one of the storylines concerns the young proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and his relationship with a woman whom his mother deems unsuitable.  The film provides a good dose of Indian culture.  I gave it four stars instead of five because the dialogue needs some work.  That wasn't as obvious during the first viewing as it was during subsequent viewings.",1366070400,2,1364,4.878260869565217

4882416,4,B005S9EJ14,"A brilliant ensemble cast of veteran British actors make this film a satisfying movie experience. if you are looking for action you will not find it here but if you are looking for acting it is here in abundance. This film will not appeal much to the highly desired 25-49 year old advertsing demographic; Its core appreciative audience will tend in age to mirror the characters in the film. Us older lot! The story lines are muti-layered and inter-connected. The action moves at a gentle yet interesting pace. The characters and their relationships develop and their observations of and coping with getting older ring true to life. The actors, all household names in the UK, with long and distinguished careers in myriad of different roles demonstrate clearly that they have lost none of their acting skills in their ""golden years."" If you enjoy watching a good story, well filmed and beautifully acted settle back and watch. You will not be disappointed.

It was about an assortment of older British people who retired to a run down hotel in India.

4882421,5,B005S9EJ14,"What a marvelous, sensitive and humorous movie this was!  Well cast and perfect character portrayals.  A loving chronicle of a group of ""mature"" people (Give us a break!  I'm almost 78 and HATE to be called ""old"" because that's not how I feel or believe I am inside!).  The group finally welds together at a run down, barely there hotel in Jaipur, India.  Each character is taking a shot at trying to make right their struggles with a physical handicap, a partner who disapproves of everyone and everything (especially her mate), widowhood, a former lover, a femme fatale whose ""attributes"" have spread out, fallen down and are misfiring, and a man in desperate need of Viagra to fulfill his fantasy as a ""stud-still-in-residence""! Young love is struggling too, as the ambitious young owner of the hotel loves a young woman whose family couldn't be more disapproving (not to mention his own interfering obnoxious mother); he's trying to redeem himself in the eyes of his family by making a success out of the seemingly doomed hotel he loves and wants to reinvent.  He is obstinately refusing to recognize that his hotel can't even provide basic amenities for current guests and hardly encourages future patronage - if it survives that long!  The sights and sounds of Jaipur are colorful, noisy, and make your senses reel and jump for joy.  Life is so different in Jaipur and it is unlike anything any of the group have experienced before, except for one group member, a former resident of Jaipur, looking for a lost love from years ago through circumstances that will bring you to tears.  This group overcomes prejudice, physical and mental disabilities, uncomfortable surroundings and chronicles inconveniences unimaginable under most normal circumstances.  The guests find a welcome release from the tedium of life they have been drowning in as well as a renewal of their internal juices and bright hope for their futures by new surroundings, strange food, customs and dress, and the freedom from fear of harsh censure by finally expressing their personal likes and dislikes; they also discover a new way they can live out the remainder of their lives under better, warmer and more loving circumstances.  Whew!  All that said, I encourage everyone (not just ""mature"" viewers) to see this movie.  If you're young or middle-aged, you might get a new perception of what lies ahead for you; you may learn how you can get a jump on those bumps in the road that may occur.  Know this for sure:  As long as you're still kicking you can change yourself or your circumstances if you set your minds and hearts to do so (except getting rid of arthritic pain and body parts that won't work the way they used to when you were younger [Oh!  Oh!])!",1365465600,3,2735,4.836909871244635

4882424,2,B005S9EJ14,This movie is well crafted and contains some wit and touching moments.  But I downgrade it because it purveys the bogus idea that romance is the central meaning in life and that we should all be dancing and romancing until we have one foot in the grave.

I find it funny the power movies have over us and the brainwashing that it tries to do.  In this movie they try to make you feel bad for homosexuals, make you feel unmarried sexual relationships are okay because of loneliness, and that marriages that are strained should just end.

Imagine their surprise in finding a run-down, ramshackle, not-really inhabitable building run by a young dreamer who has little, if any business experience or talent.

The story centers on how each of the retirees,the dreamer, his girlfriend, and their families cope with the circumstances that crop up as they try or refuse to try and make the situation work.  Funny, charming, and filled with scenes from the colorful streets of India, this film was enchanting and delightful.

With Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith paired with Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton, one could not expect less than stellar performances and magical chemistry.  That is exactly what the viewer gets.  Add Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie, and Dev Patel to round out the cast, and the cast just gets better and better.  Patel is charming as the inept hotel owner/manger/boyfriend, and he is perfectly cast along with his screen family.  The balance of personalities in this film could not be better.

The scenery provided me with a new perspective of india not the exotic (excuse the pun) one we often see.

This is a film that makes you feel human, no matter what side of the earth you are from, how many movies now-a-days makes someone feel so human?  Probably many others, but this one is a treat!

This is a great British film, although the British have many great films in comedy and drama, this takes the cake! It is a great film about a group of Brits that go to India for different reasons!

Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a widow and seeks not only to take care of the debts left to her by her now-passed on husband, but she decides that maybe she might like it in India and might want to work there!

Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge, decides to retire in India, and he wants to look for an old friend he knew since childhood and meet up with him again.

Jean (Penelope Wilton) and Douglas (Bill Nighy)  are wanting to retire in India, although as the story comes along Jean hates it there and Douglas is just happy to be there because it's different, its new and it's wonderful to him!

While single mom Madge (Celia Imrie) goes there to find another husband, another singleton on the trip Norman (Ronald Pickup)  is going there to feel young again...yes feel young again, and not in the way you might want to think either.

Muriel (Maggie Smith), a retired housekeeper who is in great physical pain,  goes to India to seek a less expensive service of doing it.  However, Muriel has some issues with Indians since she is so Anglo-centric in nature.

Of course this is how the hotel comes into play!  There is a side story about the hotel owner named Sonny (Dev Patel), who does all he can to keep the hotel and convince the group Brits and everyone else that it's a great hotel!  He also plans to keep the heart of his beloved girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae) even though his mother and her brother prefer it not be that way!

The story has a wonderful plot, a lot of funny parts, and a lot of sad ones too.  It also has great character development and a great ending!",1363910400,3,2098,4.297709923664122

4882465,3,B005S9EJ14,"THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL has strong echoes of other 'British-in-India' films, most notably HEAT AND DUST and A PASSAGE TO INDIA. A group of British pensioners decide to spend their last days - exactly why is not made quite clear - in a rundown hotel in Jaipur.  Some of them learn to adapt to new ways of life; others find it difficult, if not impossible.  John Madden's film emphasizes the importance of learning how to listen and look, especially when living in another culture.  On occasions the film resorts to crude stereotyping to make its point: Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) comes across as the well-meaning yet inefficient hotelier, while Penelope Wilton's Jean Ainslie remains a total snob throughout, believing that India lacks the 'civilized' aspects of Britain.  By contrast Judi Dench's Evelyn Greenslade is a masterpiece of understatement, as she discovers things about herself that she could never have found while in England.  Ronald Pickup's Norman Cousins realizes that he retains sexual energy, while Tom Wilkinson's Graham Dashwood comes to terms with his past.

Every character faces change in the twilight of their lives; and face those changes with fear, defiance, shame, and closure.

To me, the hotel is the metaphor for our lives...the writer (laughingly reading these reviews) probably just meant the hotel to be a run-down building! lol

I highly recommend it.  It is funny, and thought provoking.  Sad, and heart-warming.

India is not a favorite story locale for me, but the local customs and color work well in this case.  Smith portrays a middle class version of Downton's Violet who makes charming adjustments by the end, and Dench does wonders with a widow who has been left in doubtful straits.  The author's creation of a cross section of British seniors (who become residents of an Indian hotel converted to retirement home) is perfectly cast, the owner/manager of the Jaipur hotel is a delightful rascal, and the hotel itself is an interesting character.

4882510,5,B005S9EJ14,"Wow. What an amazing movie. You have over 1400 reviews here, so there's not a lot I can add to inform your perspective on what happens.

Even so, it reminds me of 'Breakfast Club' for an older generation, where you have a group of people brought to a circumstance by coincidence, yet in the process, they have a common experience.

Here, we have culture, family, grief, sadness, surprises, young-learns-from-old, love at its purest, learning from experience, joy, resolution, eternal hope, and oh so much more.

You'll be drawn to this movie if you have ever lived, traveled, learned from experience, experienced loss, or loved another.

I had this movie in my Amazon Wish List for so long, but finally watched it. It definitely warrants the 4+ stars of 1400+ reviewers.

Great lines from the movie:

* It's never over.
* Nothing happens unless we dream.
* Can we be blamed for feeling we are too old for change.
* It's also true that the person who risks nothing, has nothing, and does nothing.
* As someone once said, everything will be alright in the end. And if it's not alright, trust me, it's not the end.

4882518,4,B005S9EJ14,"Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are in one movie, so why not see that? Storywise, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has little new to say, but directed by John Madden ('Shakespeare in Love'), the romantic comedy accomplishes what it sets out to do, though rather in an obvious way. The film is not free from clichd conventions. Actually, it is full of them. Still, if you ask me if I enjoyed the film, my answer is, yes, definitely.

As I said above, the story is nothing new. Seven British retirees travel to Jaipur, India, and start living together at the Marigold Hotel run by young and enthusiastic Sonny (Dev Patel). Over time, through various events, some funny, some romantic, some even poignant, the residents of the hotel (still being restored) are given chances to change.  The great ensemble cast includes Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson and Penelope Wilton.

Some compare The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Love Actually because of the films narrative structure, but I think the themes are closer to Enchanted April (twice filmed in 1935 and 1991, the latter directed by Mike Newell). The theme of British people living or travelling outside the UK has been frequently taken up in British novels and films, and as is often the case with them, you may find the humor of Marigold Hotel a little low-key.

And that is part of the film's charm. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a well-made romantic comedy. When it comes to the dramatic part of the characters, the film is sweet and charming, or maybe too sweet and charming, but still its charms are undeniable.",1362700800,,1587,4.76

Even if I hadn't read the book, I found that the two hours this movie spent to tell the tale was weak and left many ends untied - as one other Amazon reviewer pointed out, ""how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy.

It was a fairly straight forward tale of a bunch of oldies who wanted to escape dreary old England.

Since I mostly watch Bollywood, I wasn't really interested in the main cast as much as for Dev Patel who did an amazing job as the idealistic hotel manager Sunil.  Patel lends grace, warmth, and charm to his character and commands every scene he is in.  The other highlight was Judi Dench, whose acting and narration made the movie stronger than it would have been otherwise.  An unexpected plus was the music on the main menu of the DVD, a very soothing treat for the ears.  This is a rare film which offers an accurate glimpse into life not just in Jaipur but on a larger scale, India.

4882587,4,B005S9EJ14,"Where do you go when you're elderly but still have a desire for adventure, are in need of a cheap medical treatment and/or left with no other place to go because your native homeland is far too expensive? You go to India, of course. It's affordable, exotic and a great place in which to find yourself. Lured by advertisements and bolstered with visions of a life of leisure, an eclectic group of British retirees arrives to find the Marigold Hotel a mere shell of its former glory. And though their living situation is less than expected, they are all profoundly affected by the experience of living in this foreign new land. In their own way, each of them walks a veritable path of self discovery and learns that life and love can begin anew even when you think you're way past your prime.

I rented The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel on a whim and I'm glad that I did. Based off a popular novel of the same name, the movie tells the story of several cash-poor English retirees who travel to India looking for sex, love, rebirth, closure and/or adventure. Naturally, things go awry for the bunch starting with their arrival at the less than desirable Marigold Hotel. But through a series of follies, trials and adventures the gang grows closer to one another and they manage to learn a valuable lesson in the process: it's never too late to seek out new beginnings. Played by the creme de la creme of British acting royalty, the cast of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, inspires and dazzles.

Dame Maggie Smith plays the feisty and untouchable xenophobe, Muriel, who comes to India unwillingly to receive a hip replacement. If there's one thing Dame Smith can play, it's surly and she does so with a wryness and bitterness that is both sad and cheeky at the same time. And what makes her so lovable is not only the humour behind her situation, but the redemption that comes along with it. Actually, this goes for all of the cast. Then we have Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton as your testy, argumentative old couple. Nighy is open, he's an explorer whereas Wilton is unwilling and set in her ways. They come face to face with a drastic decision regarding the nature of their marriage. Tom Wilkinson, as Graham Dashwood, comes to India looking for his long-lost love. Then there's Dame Judi Dench as our main narrator, Evelyn Greenslade. She goes to India after the death of her husband seeking closure but really as more of an escape. What she finds, however, is a fresh start and a new outlook on life.

Most of the action centers in and around the Marigold Hotel with Dev Patel playing its struggling manager, Sonny Kapoor. Every time he takes the screen, he steals the scenes with his fervent hope and optimism. Perhaps what I love the most, though, is that India itself is another prime character of the film. We're given a bird's eye view of the vibrancy of Jaipur from the crowded streets to the colourful markets and the serene customs. It's a whimsical and refreshing vacation folding out right in front of your eyes. I think what makes the setting stand out so much is the allusion created using the stark contrast between the India's progression and the old colonial habits of the British characters living there.  It's poignant and powerful.

My only real issues with the movie are that there's a number of cast members and story lines to follow and it can be a bit to keep up with. And it's inevitable that you are eventually going to connect with some of them more than others. I won't deny, the movie can at times, be a tad predictable especially near the end. You kind of know that everything is going to be wrapped up in a perfect little bow despite the issues that have arisen. But that's okay because it's supposed to be a feel-good kinda film and if there's one thing this movie has, great acting talent aside, it's heart. There's nothing more perfect than that because we all know, all's well that ends well, right?

Food for Thought: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a sweet, irreverent, cheeky film featuring some of the greatest British actors of our time. While it can be a bit predictable at times, the movie's ultimate message is an endearing one that speaks to the heart. This isn't just a film for folks in their golden years, it's one of those powerful movies that can be enjoyed by adults of all ages because the themes are super relatablel. This movie will make you laugh and cry, smile and admire. And if anything, you'll be in a state of wanderlust for quite some time.",1361750400,3,4497,4.580124223602485

Consequently, they buy into a  dream: a seniors only residence in India.

The script and editing are topnotch, the actors all prominent and superb, everything all a great film should offer right in place.

It's like taking a journey that you feel happy and confident about from the first moments. The film does have moments of cliche but it doesn't matter or effect the overall enjoyment.

Only one oldster (Maggie Smith, of course) noticed the bumbling would-be hotel entrepreneur, stumbled into noticing the outcast of the Hindu caste system, and had such wonderful one-liners. Her timing is impeccable. Of course, I'm writing from the perspective of an older generation. This reminded me of spending 18 months in Mexico city. The culture shock is/was incredible to those who haven't traveled to other non-English-speaking nations. This shock was illustrated graphically through the photography.",1360972800,,615,5.553191489361702

4882655,5,B005S9EJ14,"THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL does everything a good comedy should; i.e., it reveals a great deal about life, death, love, and happiness without ever seeming preachy or pretentious, remaining, on the surface, simply a light, entertaining film. TBEMH involves seven very different yet equally discontented British people who, all for different reasons, travel to a ""resort"" hotel in Jaipur, India. The hotel does not turn out to be all that was advertised, and therein lies much of the comedy. Owner/manager ""Sonny"" (Dev Patel) is eager to make his establishment work, and the way his stereotypically Indian bombastic hyperbole contrasts with the Brits' stereotypically staid understatement is, well, noteworthy. Although the film has one or two ""lol"" moments, much of the humor is of a quieter variety that is shaped by this contrasting dialogue.

Outstanding cinematography, with some really exquisite Indian scenery. Great acting by all, and Judi Dench gives an especially memorable performance as Evelyn Greenslade. While there is not a lot of really intense, dramatic action, nor is there a dull moment. Wonderful ending: The characters all undergo some often small  yet always substantial changes, and so should anyone who watches this film.",1360800000,,1247,5.38974358974359

Worse, the set was depressing and it never got much better.  In fact, it made the whole idea of retiring in India seem much less appealing, and that was only from the visual and sound track.

I found the entire movie a waste of time. I kept hoping for a memorable scene that would make the experience more positive, but it never came.  This isn't the worse movie ever, but it hardly is worth your $10 to watch it.",1360627200,,567,4.174311926605505

Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton were not particularly likable characters (especially Penelope) and they were outstanding. I felt embarrassed and awkward for them but was rooting for them as well, even though I just couldn't like them very much. In the end, it was a story about real life in a sort of fantasy setting.

As the story unfolds, each finds hidden talents, and there's an interesting message that their life experience, in various areas, is exactly what is needed for them and the Hotel.
Being a senior myself I thought at first I enjoyed the film because it hinted that we're never too old to be important to others, but then realized that the person who recommended the film to me is barely 50. So I guess it will appeal to all age groups, with each taking away a different message.

One thinks it is about aging people, but it dissolves into the story of an aging homosexual looking for his old lover in India... the old Indian dude had gone on to marry and have a family... and the gay dude dies. Parts of it were very pretty, some lines were hilarious and some scenes touching, but it's not something or appropriate subject matter for young children.",1360108800,,517,4.56989247311828
4882706,4,B005S9EJ14,"Really enjoyed this movie...had a little trouble in the beginning figuring out who was who and sometimes couldn't understand the heavy Indian accents, but other than that, the movie was very enjoyable!  Nice to see one with no bad language, no violence and very little sexual connotation as I watched it with my 16 year old daughter who also enjoyed it.",1360108800,2,353,4.786885245901639

4882711,3,B005S9EJ14,"This is a nice enough movie with the usual themes:  the Indian hotel manager is a buffoon, the caste system is unjust and the Europeans address the injustices somewhat, and one man's searches for his sometime homosexual lover.  Couples break up and couples get back together.  Scenes of India are okay; not much dramatic.  Yawn.",1360022400,,328,4.909090909090909

4882713,4,B005S9EJ14,"I enjoyed this movie, especially the performances by the absolutely wonderful cast they had assembled.  The story is set in India, where a group of...shall we say, retirement age folks decide to spend their golden years for an assortment of reasons.  One man is returning to find his lost love of years ago.  A couple with not much money hopes to stretch out their bank account.  Another lady comes to get an operation and finds herself confronting her own prejudices.

The hotel that they journey to is run-down, but still incredible.  Culture-shock abounds, and some end up thriving and others run away from the sights, smells, sounds, and food of this very non-English land.

But the real star of this movie is the place.  Brightly colored, always on the move, exotic, beautiful and dreadful, old-fashioned and future-oriented at once, India shines through the story.  We see it through the eyes of this older generation as well as through the eyes of the young Indian people who are striving to make their way in the world, including the owner of the hotel who wants to break with tradition and marry a woman his mother doesn't approve of.

Quite enjoyable for an evening, but probably too slow-moving for some.",1360022400,,1215,4.826086956521739

The movie was good, but the characters were changed around from the book.  The book was really a good story, more feeling than the movie, you got the emotions of both generations of families, mothers/fathers vs. sons/daughters in the book.  The movies had very little to do with the children which was a shame, it was why they were there in the first place.  Anyway would recommend either/both.",1359849600,,559,4.421568627450981

The service says that when it senses that the download speed decrease so will the quality of the movie, from HD down to something considerably less.  We have, by frequent measure, a download speed of up to 30 mps, yet the system chose to give us one out of four dots of quality more or less arbitrarily for the last 30 minutes.

While watching this movie about a few British retirees taking an extended trip to India for various reasons, I often found myself comparing my own life after retirement with the characters in the movie.

It is a life affirming movie for those of us who are older which says even though our bodies are now
compromised our spirits are just as strong, if not stronger, than in our younger years. Not to put
off things we want to do any longer as long as we are still capable physically. We cripple ourselves

The young Indian entrepreneur is the one who played in the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionair. This British group of retirees travel as a group to India and of course, at first are quite overwhelmed by the drastic differences and some adapt better than others. One never does, divorces her husband and goes back to India while her husband relishes visiting all the old beautiful temples. The princely hotel is also not quite cut out to be what they had been told in England but the enthusiasm of trying to make a go of it of this young entrepreneur is quite charming and there are some cute mix-ups.

The cast is supurb, and seasoned.  It's a shame this film did not get the recognition it deserved.  If you are looking for a refreshing alternative to the usual junk out there try this.

4882807,4,B005S9EJ14,"Stocked with a plethora of gifted British actors of a certain age, director John Madden produces a fine film full of color and life if a little short of substance.  Deborah Moggach's novel, adapted for the screen by Ol Parker, begins in England with a look at the various characters as they decide how to live out their retirement.  Most are on a limited budget so one option is a retirement home in Jaipur, India.  The on-line information suggests a modern upscale facility in what used to be a glamorous hotel.

Judi Dench heads the cast as Evelyn Greenslade, recently widowed and on her own for the first time.  She also serves as the narrator, documenting her days in a journal.  The always fun to watch Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are a couple that you immediately wonder why they are together.  Tom Wilkinson is a closeted gay returning to the area where he spent his early adult years, looking for a former lover.  Maggie Smith is a racist grump looking for a cheap hip replacement.  There are others with their own backgrounds.  Then there is the young hotel manager (Dev Patel) whose modest ruse to lure residents has a noble purpose.

Mixing this all up doesn't really deliver much in the way of originality, but watching these veteran actors interact is certainly fun and entertaining.  Madden's visuals are beautiful.  He mixes in the chaotic street life with the color and personalities of the Indian people.  While we can see where this is all going, the trip is enjoyable.

The transfer to Blu ray is excellent.  As usualy it comes with a 1080p resolution and an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  When our characters leave grey looking England and land in colorful India, the video display pops as well with an inundation of orange,green, pink, turquois.  The palet is clear and crisp.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio and is likewise excellent.  While the film is dialog heavy, there is enough music and street life to keep the surrounds busy.  Car horns, trains and planes send plenty of information to keep the viewer centered in the story.  An excellent soundtrack plays throughout and is handled well in the transfer.",1359072000,2,2132,4.736413043478261

The movie has an interesting premise, and lots of potential, but anything out of the ordinary in the story was given superficial treatment. It was light, and almost anything that could have been heavy and dramatic didn't really belong. On the other hand, this was not a hootfest either. It stayed in amusing mode throughout. It's because of the cast and the rarity of a senior cast and theme that doesn't go all tragic that I give it 4 stars. Does everything about older people have to be maudlin?

On the surface, it may seem like a movie about old people, but it's much, much more than that. It's about the new beginnings, and hope, and being true to yourself and not giving up in big and small ways, and about it never being too late to do something you think is right. I realize this may sound corny but the movie is far from it. It's funny and kind and has a happy ending that is just the right side of the fairy tale.

4882865,3,B005S9EJ14,"A friend completely raved about this movie when she saw it in the theatre, so I was excited to watch it when it was released on ""video"".

I love almost all of the actors in this movie - who wouldn't? They have such pedigree! The cast was something like a ""best-of-Britain"". And they each played their parts beautifully. The cinematography cast a magical air about the story, the scenery was stunning.

But even with all of these things in favour of the movie, I found the storyline ultimately very weak which was such a shame. If you choose to watch the movie, enjoy the atmosphere of this movie, but don't expect anything too deep.",1358380800,,632,4.535087719298246

Fantastic actors who expressed powerful emotions concerning senior citizens and the ways they faced their loneliness and love. It was a very touching movie, one that I can relate to, and I plan to view it several more times before sharing it with some of my other friends. I look forward to more films in this same genre. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel, Tom Wilkinson, and Bill Nighy are to be commended for outstanding performances.",1358380800,,609,4.5963302752293576

No one needs me to applaud the performances of all these fabulous British actors of high reputation. Maggie Smith - brutal and riotous in a wheelchair. Judi Dench being a little ditsy - James Bond wouldn't recognize her.

I'd like to put in a good word for the Indian actors in the subplot. Dev Patel, Tena Desea, Lilete Dubey & Seema Azmi (as the maid) are all compelling in their performances, considering how little screen time they actually receive.

A totally delightful movie with every emotion you could want and a few surprises just for fun.",1358294400,,1295,6.523255813953488

The choice of actors, the acting, the sites, the premise of the movie were all woven together so beautifully to create a very touching and very real thing that could have happened to anyone who travels in a group. I also enjoyed the part after the movie was over where you can see how the film was created and hear the director's and the actor's comments and more. It's a treasure I will watch again and again.",1358294400,,578,4.123893805309734
4882878,5,B005S9EJ14,"The lineup of actors and actresses can't be more appropriate; they all seemed so natural in their roles. Any
film that features Maggie Smith and Judy Dench, is a winner. To me this would be the adventure of a lifetime;
one of those vacations for laid back personalities who are able to handle the most adverse conditions, coming
along in a very unexpected way. This is definitely not a uxury vacation in any tangible respect. However, this
movie is rich in the development of unique personal relationships. The pace of the movie is like a leisurely
elephant walk thru a jungle path. Personally, I wish that I had the guts to take such a vacation. I highly recommend
this movie for those folks with adventure in their hearts and an appreciation for taking time to smell the roses.",1358294400,,779,4.6521739130434785

I fell asleep 1/2 into the movie and when I woke up, I hadn't missed anything. It was boring when fell asleep and was boring when I woke up. The kid from Slumdog millionaire really proved that being directed well brings out good performances, which was true for Slumdog; not so much for this movie. The idea was cute but skip the movie.

Lots of contemplative dialogue that will motivate you to hold on for one more second when you just want to 'go home'. As the movie progresses, you forget about their age, because of their willingness to not let that inhibit their lust for life.

An overall feel-good film, with superb wit and humor. This film is wonderfully paced, and I found myself laughing quite often. There were many great one liners, for example:

""Don't you worry about the dangers of having sex at your age?""
""If she dies...she dies.""

4882942,5,B005S9EJ14,"Although the theme may not be realistic, that does not seem to matter.  The film is extremely entertaining, and the settings are very exotic and characteristic of India.  The characters are well-drawn and mirror the feelings and experiences of retirees who come from the British culture.  The acting is moving and convincing, perhaps because the roles are played by well-known or talented actors.  The adjustment factor, including the pain of the unfamiliar, is starkly expressed.

The movie is about a group of  people and the ways they choose to get on with their lives while staying in India.  The hotel everyone has chosen to stay at is most definitely a work in progress for its young owner. The characters and their humor gives this movie a warm and positive feeling. This is not a thrill a minute movie but floats you along for a quick trip to a place where in the end everything works out. Don't some of us need that from time to time?

4882978,5,B005S9EJ14,"My husband and I watched this movie on New Year's Eve while waiting for the ball to drop in Times Square.  We were thoroughly entertained!  It's a story about a group of seven elderly British citizens who decided one way or another to spend their time in a rundown hotel in India for ""the elderly and beautiful"".  Of course, none of them knew before leaving England that this hotel was NOT as shown in the glossy brochure they saw, but a dilapidated place in India, managed by a young man whose dream was much bigger than his wallet.  At first, the group was horrified, but they soon adjust to their exotic environment.  Each had their reason for going to India.  Some in search of lost love, while others in search of independence and, in one case, a new hip.

The screenplay was witty and the plot moved along.  My only complaint was that the introduction was rather rushed so was bit confusing.  But never mind.  The movie had a GREAT cast and the director did a fine job of weaving the scenes!  Some part of the movie was predictable, but most were poignant and entertaining.  This movie is not limited to the mature audience.  Young adults will get some insight into the human relationship.  This is a critically acclaimed movie and deservedly so.",1357257600,,1252,4.556053811659193

4882986,4,B005S9EJ14,"I've seen this movie twice and liked it both times.  It took us into a world that was completely foreign to the characters, and foreign to the audience as well.  It was eye opening to see a slice of Indian life, if only from a movie perspective.  Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were great as always.  Each character had their own reasons for being there and had a different outlook on their unfamiliar and shocking surroundings.  I really didn't like the character of Mrs. Ainsley, but who would.  She had great facial expressions though.

There was just a little bit about their backgrounds in England, but enough to set the stage for their behavior at the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"".
They talk a lot about how they are old, but they seem very youthful for the most part.

I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy watching life in a different land that you may not be familiar with, and those who enjoy character driven films.",1357171200,,934,4.550898203592815

It was uneven - passages were enthalling only to stall out later. Some scenes and turns in the story seemed rushed. Yet, others were very satisfying. It is funny, poignant, interesting in its colorful setting (although it seemed limited in the variety of locations). But, there are some sad moments, too. All in all, it is a little like real life - a -mixed bag. Be forewarned,there are emotional issues of aging, financial stress, and death.

Watching it with the knowledge that it isn't a perfect movie allows it to be an entertaining and worthwhile movie. I would watch it again.",1357084800,,743,4.75968992248062

Perhaps that was the problem and we had high expectations of being entertained and provided with many laughs.  In reality, we felt the movie was a stretch, an over the top and far out place with odd rooms, worn out old folks and some silly laugh lines.  Basically, we felt sad in the end for those who had hoped this would be the ideal place to retire, and for us as well for hoping it would be full of solid enjoyment.",1357084800,,491,4.258064516129032

4883006,3,B005S9EJ14,"More chaotic than structured, more implausible than convincing, and its happy ending is welcome for its being gratifyingly final. What redeems the movie are the reliably solid performances of Judy Dench and Maggie Smith. Its other virtue is characterization; insights here and there into the variations and subtleties of that ubiquitous emotion we call love.

Guess I'm a traditionalist and when the tale involves a gay man reconnecting with his lover, a wife dumping her husband, an old swinger struggling to pick up a babe for a one night stand and so forth all set in a run down Indian hotel my interest fades pretty quickly.  Whatever happened to honorable people even in old age determining to do the right thing?  Not in this movie.  Wish I had my $3.99 back.",1357084800,2,489,4.271739130434782

4883036,5,B005S9EJ14,"There are few movies that I can say are without equal.  Ordinary People is an example among a few others.  The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel gets on my list as one of the best.  On one level the story line is simple, take some people, throw them into a bad situation and watch what happens.  Yet on another level this story is very complex.  One is given a chance to explore right along with the characters how they tackle problems, how they react and interact to each other and to life events they encounter.
Part of the pleasure for me was becoming part of the movie as I also explored how I would have reacted, dealt with, and changed as the story progressed.  I found something in each character, even the ones I did not like, that was me.

Casting was spot on, with many of my favorite actors (special kudos to Dame Maggie Smith!).  The dialogue was pithy and witty and deftly touched on many areas that seniors are having to deal with ... what to do with yourself when the 1st acts of your life are over?  self-worth when age is indicating you aren't worthy ... etc.

I wish there were more like this for my demographic!  Highly recommended.  I rented, but will definitely be purchasing.

It is life as lived by retirees searching for a home in their retirement years, love as experienced by the young man who owns the hotel and his girl friend, and so much more. Happy, sad and everything in between.
I've seen it 2 times, once in the theater and then I bought it and I never buy movies and I never watch hardly any movie twice or three times.

4883079,3,B005S9EJ14,"So last night I watched The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was kind of stupid and anticlimactic in a pretty large way (it just went nowhere) but it was fun and flew by despite the two hour running length (movies like this could easily edit to 90 minutes, but I honestly didn't feel it drag).

The film centers on a group of senior citizens at a crucial turning point in their lives and they all pick up and move to India.  They don't know one another but all wind up living in the same hotel, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  You have a woman who lost her savings after her husband died.  You have a gay man in pursuit of his long lost lover.  You have a couple financially strapped due to a wayward daughter.  You have a grandmother fed up with being used by her daughter.  You have an elderly man trying desperately to regain his youth through some tantric sex and you have an old racist in need of a new hip.  Together they make an eclectic bunch.  Upon their arrival to India all is not as they expected, especially the hotel, which is nearly in ruins.  The hotel manager, the young and exuberant Sonny, is in way over his head, but he is determined to make this work.  Some of the group immediately start to embrace their newfound surroundings, while others are dead set on hating it.

Over the course of the next two hours, this group seeks for something (nothing we can really put our finger on) and then finds something else (again, I'm not sure what) and the end comes, which works out all right (because obviously when things were going bad they weren't at the end yet).

My issues with The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel stem from lackluster writing.  Dench's voiceover is supposed to shed light on the group's progressive nature and yet it just feels empty and void of any real substance.  Like I said, there doesn't seem to be any resolve and even when the film draws to a close and they're talking about not finding what you were looking for but finding something better I was scratching my head wondering just what it was that they actually found.

I mean, India was pretty.

Still, this is a very easy film to watch and the entire cast shines in their respecative ways.  Dench turns out a true `Meryl Streep in a role Meryl Streep isn't trying to get Oscar nominated for' performance, you know, the roles that usually land Meryl a filler Oscar nomination anyways.  She's great here and I actually think it may be one of her finest performances ever since she lightens up and has some fun.  She's always so serious.  I'm glad that Nighy did not play Graham, the gay man, because it would have been far too obvious.  Thankfully, Tom Wilkinson gets it all sorts of right (more on that in a minute).

I am stumped on something though.  Why is Maggie Smith getting singled out here?  Sure, she's funny, but like she's played this character in nearly every other movie she's been in.  Ha, I know that this is an argument that meets serious opposition by her devoted fans, and I am one of her fans so don't take that wrong, but Smith has fallen back on stuffy old English woman for quite some time now.  In her prime she was all sorts of marvelous (`California Suite' is one of the greatest showcases for her talent) but I'm talking about the past decade.  Still, she's been singled out and even received a SAG nomination and is considered in the running for an Oscar nomination for this.  Seriously?  I'm struggling to understand what it is that she does that is so special.  She plays a racist who has a change of heart and learns to walk again.  Problem is, it's a rather underwritten part and she doesn't have much to chew on other than a scene or two where she spouts a funny line.  Instead, I really wish that Tom Wilkinson were getting the awards attention.  The way he molds Graham with limited screen time and yet such backstory is sensational.  His confession scene with Dench is beautiful, and that hug is heartbreaking, and even though his lighthearted revelation comes off a bit underdeveloped (like, I'm not even sure he knows what he's getting at) he delivers it with such warmth and adds a beautiful layer to his character.

I don't think I'd nominate him myself, since so far this year has been a bounty of supporting performances, but it is truly best in show and deserves to be noted as such.

So, at the end of the day I have to say that I was pleased with the overall experience.  It is light and fun and has some emotional heft, but it lacks development and winds up being very forgettable because it essentially says absolutely nothing.",1356652800,,4612,4.458233890214797

The cast is superb, the dialog well written, the story.....though certainly not profound.....is good theater.  Sometmes funny, sometimes sad, both simple and complex.

Each character was presented in depth with backgrounds and emotions and then tied with others in a well put together storyline.  The mainly elderly cast was physically shown as they were with wrinlkles and flaws.  Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton were outstanding.

The plot involves a small group of unlikely older travel companions uprooting themselves from England and going together to India. One for faster access to a hip replacement operation, another was a retired high-level judge seeking his prior male lover, several singles, and a couple whose marriage had become strained. They're all headed for the same hotel, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, run by the youngest son of the recently deceased owner - he's well-intentioned, but far more glib talk than reality.

The hotel's finances, as well as its hold on these new guests (its only guests) are headed for collapse; similarly, the manager's romance with a young girl his mother forbids marriage to. Eventually most everyone's problems are resolved (the judge dies after finding his former lover, now married), and the hotel's future is saved by the thinking and commitment of the woman originally most unhappy with India.",1356566400,,1008,5.146341463414634

The storyline is also pretty believable as more Brits and Americans look beyond their home counties to find a place to retire that is actually affordable. The screen writers capture a range of characters and reactions -- and show the growth of the characters over time, allowing viewers to identify with the pain, confusion, and sometimes anger of coping with culture shock and with the shock of finding one's self at a new stage in life when everything they knew and counted on has changed. The depiction of India is somewhat stereotyped, but no more than would be expected as the background for any 2 hr film and the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sound, the crowdedness, and the exotica of a wholly unknown culture fairly realistic. (I also just LOVE that for once one of the romantic couples is cast with the female actor quite a bit older than the male instead of the other way around -- rather than introduce a spoiler, I'll just say that this couple includes Judi Dench.) It's about time that film makers realized that literate films with older actors in a storyline that nature audiences can identify with can result in a engaging film and appeal to a broad audience -- the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a winner.",1356307200,,1360,4.718487394957983

To start with it's about the getting older process, something we are all doing, but some of us are just a bit more into it that the youngsters. Point is it's something that effects us all. The setting is in India and my, like one of the characters says, sic, ""an assault on all the senses"" and all at once.

It is, however, very honest with its characters and the laughs are definitely there.",1356134400,,377,4.405797101449275

The cast is absolutely delightful and Judi Dench and Maggie Smith carry the movie expertly while Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Dav Patel and the supporting cast all chip in to make this sleeper hit something more than a few old folks looking for a place to retire. There's humour and more importantly, plenty of heart, that life takes on different turns, sometimes bad but mostly right.  ""Everything will be all right in the end. And if it's not all right, it's not yet the end.""",1356134400,2,612,4.614678899082569

I love how the characters were individuals with personal problems that were solved during the show.  Great movie for inspiration to finding the courage to do something for yourself and not just sit at home and vegetate.  Now, I don't say we should all pack up and head for India.  There are great places in this world to visit and stay a while. There should be places around the world that would house the older generation for a few months at a time reasonably.  Then we could move on to the next place for a few months.  I like the idea and would like to know if it already exists.  Sign me up!",1356134400,,704,4.17037037037037

4883163,5,B005S9EJ14,"I enjoyed this movie VERY much! One reason is that it evokes the reality of India so well that one feels as though you've been there. Another is that the people are so real, you can recognize your own experiences, and that of friends in them.
  The portrayal of the gay person was done so well, not sensationalized---but presented as a reality of life---and death.
  The cast was exceptional---such talented STARS!

4883164,2,B005S9EJ14,"When HD first came out, I predicted that it would be the end of several TV/movie careers: David Hasellhoff as a 30-something leading man, Regis Philbin as anything, for example,

I didn't predict that actors would just swallow their vanity (they are actors, after all) and parade their wrinkles for the Hi-Def cameras.  I sympathize somewhat, since I'm chronologically in the same zip code, but short of their being in need of the money, I see no reason for them to participate in projects like this.  We count on the people emoting on screen being a lot better looking than us.  We can tolerate Judi Dench as ""M"" but not as a love interest.

4883214,5,B005S9EJ14,"One often hears about films--this one as well as others--that ""it was not as good as the book.""  This is generally true when the film attempts to replicate the book:  prose is far more dense and nuanced than film:  a 60-page novella is often enough material for a feature movie.  Attempting to compress 200 or 300 pages for screening usually results in extensive cutting or moviegoers with bedsores on their bums.

I first fell in love with the film, and then I read the book by Deborah Moggach (of the same title in the U.S.  Both are excellent but very different.  The film does not attempt to follow the book; rather, it takes ideas and characters from the book and makes a movie of them.  The book is darker and more conflicted, less love story, more familial strife.  Moggach writes very well indeed; I enjoyed the novel so much that I have purchased another of hers and look forward to reading it.",1355702400,,903,4.5246913580246915

4883220,4,B005S9EJ14,"Sure you might not want to watch it every day or even once a month, but after seeing it once, I know I will want to see it again. It is not a Ha Ha comedy,it is a black comedy that the Brits do so well. Like ""One Foot In the Grave"" and such. You get humor and reality all rolled into one, just a whole lot like real life. What appealed to me, besides the great cast, was being set in India. I like seeing and learning about other cultures and lifestyles and I get ""into"" it as if I was there trying to make my way through the crowds and hearing all the noises that are the large cities in India. I also appreciate that everything is not the whites only country club setting, and we see the hard scrabble side as well. I think they did a good job of showing the up sides and the down sides of anglo-european/anglo-americans that try to live outside of their native lands in countries where they tend to feel they are special. This is even more unusual being that they are all older and in theory set in their ways, yet most of them manage to adjust and decide to stay on. Only one decides she can not and will not cope, she is totally unhappy to the point of making everyone else miserable too, and you are releaved to see her head home. Watch this, then watch ""Jewel in the Crown"" to see the difference in the attitudes of the Brits. Bear in mind that Jewel is set circa world war 2 and the feeling of entitlement is so much stronger. Another good one to compare this one to is ""Ghandi"" or ""Passage to India"" All great British made flicks. I have to watch this one again anyway just to absorb more of the backround. Most scenes there is so much going on, it is hard to see everything... Just enjoy even if you don't like all the characters....",1355529600,,1743,4.129411764705883

This film touches on that sadness but develops the characters in rather more gentle and beautiful ways.  I like them both for different reasons.  Perhaps the filmmakers loved the book and took the faithfully rendered characters out to play a little, to enjoy life a little more.  Fantastic casting really makes this picture as well as the clever script and the cutting between the two story lines, one of India, the other of a fading English empire.

However, the film was a good one to see anyway. This is a cute, feel good film. All the actors give great performances.

4883323,5,B005S9EJ14,"Why did I like this movie?  Let me count the ways.  1.  The cast.  These are the best of the best in the profession of movies and stage performances.  2.  The location.  India with all the colors and noise is the best place to bring this movie home.  Finally the story.  I think all of us of a certain age would love to just drop everything and go on an adventure.  It is what more movies should be made of.  Love, adventure and showing the world different cultures in a positive light.",1354752000,,486,4.173913043478261

4883325,3,B005S9EJ14,"This would have been wonderful had the plot lines been more fully integrated. It was far too contrived. The location was terrific, and the Indian actors were a treat. The cultural themes were intriguing as well. I would watch these English actors read the phone book so I enjoyed it, but it will likely have limited appeal to those not older and dealing with  or anticipating dealing with end of life issues. In the end I felt cheated. It should have been a great film instead of just okay.",1354752000,,490,4.50561797752809
4883326,5,B005S9EJ14,"I loved this movie so much that I saw it three times in the theater and bought it when it was released.  Have always been a fan of British acting and Judi Dench gives another brilliant performance in this movie.  What I loved most, however, was the portrayal of India.  This isn't the India that Hollywood normally presents, but having been to India twice in the last two years, this is the India I met and the reason I went back the second time and will go again.  ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" depicts the India I met--an India of crowds, chaos, and kindness.  Definitely the best movie I have seen this year.  If you like British acting and enjoyed ""The King's Speech,"" you are almost assured of enjoying this movie enough to buy it.",1354752000,,739,4.437037037037037

4883334,5,B005S9EJ14,"Advertised as a feel good movie, this film was much more than that. It made me feel good because it scratched the surface of human relationships. It combined character-based humor as people dealt with the dilapidation of an Indian hotel and their old age. As I am facing the latter, it probably meant more to me. The cast is a tour de force of British acting witgh a large measure of excellent Indian acting. It does everything I expect from a film. It takes you away from yourself in space and time, and brings you back home.",1354665600,,526,4.43298969072165

4883337,5,B005S9EJ14,"I highly recommend this excellent movie! Superb cast of first rate actors, veterans and newcomers alike. The story is of several retired people, couples and individuals, looking to find a warm place to eke out their dwindling incomes. They each opt for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, lured by the beautiful pictures and glowing descriptions in the glossy brochure, but the reality that awaits them is somewhat different. The actual hotel is woefully (and comically) short of its promise. The inhabitants (including the manager) react according to their characters, providing comedy, tragedy, joy and triumph.",1354665600,,609,5.421052631578948

4883339,4,B005S9EJ14,"A delightful story-line filled with seniors, for the most part - single and couples, are ending a huge chapter in life and beginning another.. Where most, at their age, would be content with the idea of living out the rest of their days in the same place they've always been, they decide otherwise. Many different people - with even more different and sometimes contrasting, lives and lifestyles - leave everything they've ever known, for a whole new world, they know nothing about. But, who could resist the beautiful and exotic rest haven offered in the Marigold brochure?? Arriving at their new abode, only to find it run down and in need of major repairs, they realized that the motel was the only first, of many, newly acquired impositions. Forced to share their environment, their opposing characters clash with some, find solace in others and, in the end, find that they are not so entirely different from the others, as originally believed. Surprisingly, the biggest difference was from within! And, witnessing the young owner's struggle to achieve his dreams of not only success, but love, brings forth the vitality they hadn't had since their youth, further allowing them to dream, to believe, to fight, to love........  A MOVIE TO REMIND US:  There's never an 'ending' in life, only new chapters! And, no matter the age, their is always plenty of room for open-mindedness, acceptance and, most importantly, CHANGE!!!",1354665600,,1427,5.0168776371308015

4883341,5,B005S9EJ14,"This is the story of life at a certain age told with compassionate introspection, gentleness and humor. In scene after scene, the camera is your surrogate as witness of life's pace, emotions and colors. One can imagine the smells which accompany the images and sounds. It is that well done. Then, the cast. Rarely, in any story, is there opprtunity to display this much talent.
This movie is not action, flash, vulgar or shallow. It other words it won't entertain one's purient nature. In fact, it does not entertain at all. Rather, it invites you in as a silent witness to what people's lives are like when those lives become bittersweet. In doing so, your emotions will not leave you saddened. They will leave you uplifted with the warmth only a seasoned love for life can bring. Do yourself a favor, do not miss experiencing The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel because in the end, everything will be good. And, if it is not good; it is not the end.",1354665600,,946,4.603550295857988

4883349,4,B005S9EJ14,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the movie loosely based on the novel These Foolish Things, by British author, Deborah Moggach. The basic premise of the movie is that a group of older Britons travel to India to reside in a hotel near Jaipur. What they have been sold, and what they actually get, are two different things, but, between them, somehow, this group of strangers finds something worthwhile. On this, the book and the movie agree, but on many significant points, the movie differs greatly from the novel. Norman, well played by Ronald Pickup, is much less objectionable in the movie. Maggie Smith does a wonderful portrayal of Muriel Donnelly, as does Judi Dench of Evelyn Greenslade. Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) is a similar character in both movie and novel, but Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) is markedly different. Graham Dashwood, played by Tom Wilkinson, is an entirely new character who seems to be a composite of Adam Ainslie, Graham Turner and Dorothy Miller. Celia Imrie does a magnificent job playing Madge Hardcastle (MadgeRheinhart in the book) and Dev Patel is marvellous as Sonny Kapoor, another composite (Sonny Rahim and Minoo Cowsajee). Although the screenplay is quite different from the novel plot, it works well and there are plenty of laughs as well as some lump in the throat moments. A real pleasure to watch.",1354579200,,1345,4.982222222222222

4883353,5,B005S9EJ14,"This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen in years. In an age where a movie seems to need zombies, vampires, mass murderers or superheroes to be successful, this movie is such a gem. The cast is stellar and their performances are outstanding. The basic premise of the film of how one survives after retirement is one which most of us will be forced to face at some point. Their solution is both bold and seemingly reckless. Herein lies the fun! Their journey is not all fun and games, but in the end, you'll want to jump up and cheer--it's really that good! Enjoy!",1354579200,,575,4.433962264150943

4883360,5,B005S9EJ14,It's a golden years story of people searching for something that still gives meaning to their lives. And it's funny and sad and thought provoking . It allows glimpses of life that is so familiar and yet half a world away. It doesn't shove things down your throat but rather seduces you into the moment. The scenes in the call center are a reminder of what has happened to our country with out-sourcing but also the problems of the populations of those countries trying to understand us. The acting of all participants is excellent. This is a movie worth watching over and over just for the scenery. So get out the hankies and popcorn.,1354579200,,634,4.5701754385964914

The hotelin India is not the ""Hyatt nor Marriots""but becomes more than that -becomes the ""glue""which binds this group of British retirees
It si a nice story - yes some tears some laughter - some tears and all ends well

Not a movie for all audience but I loved it (I want now to go and explore India -on a moped...)

a really good mother/daughter movie.  Well!  I watched over half of it

I wasted my money.",1354406400,,316,4.064516129032258

4883384,5,B005S9EJ14,"I hate the way that we treat our elderly in this country. I wish that we revered them the way that they do in some countries.

It's for that reason that this movie makes you wish it was real.  In The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, seven retirees, all struggling with their new identities as ""old and useless,"" decide to head to India based on the advertisement for the hotel.  What they find is not what they expected - the hotel isn't quite finished and it is not the lap of luxury for which some had hoped.  However, some do find ways to reinvent themselves.

You can't go wrong with this cast - Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, Ronald Pickup, and Celia Imrie.  They remind us that life does not stop at 40 or 50 or even 60.  There are so many beautiful moments in this film.  And the younger set in the movie, Dev Patel and Tena Desae, are wonderful as well.

Loved it and highly recommend it.",1354406400,,930,4.329479768786127

That being said, this really is a fabulous movie!!! Don't get hung up on the fact the the main characters are being played by older actors, because they are great actors and really bring emotion to the forefront. Don't get hung up on the fact that there is a lot going on in the movie - it is not overwhelming and makes sense. Don't get hung up on the how things happen in the movie - it isn't real life and by the way, strange & predictable things happen in reality as well!

What you need to do is sit back and enjoy it! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, & at some level anyone of us can identify with it at some point. Enjoy the scenery, the colors, the wit. It is worth it!

Besides, what in the world is wrong with a movie with older actors in it any way?!! Like death & taxes, becoming older is guaranteed!",1353974400,,946,4.048128342245989

4883428,5,B005S9EJ14,"Being of the age of or a little younger than the characters in this movie, made me appreciate the situations in which they found themselves - the scene with Judi Dench trying to deal with a customer service agent in India was especially familiar..  Some characters moved half-way around the world by choice, some by circumstance.  It was lovely to see how each person grew into a new role and how each got a second chance.  I wish I had the courage to begin an adventure like this.

At first, I thought this was more a movie for us seniors.  However, old age can be scary and unexpected things happen.  It was very nice to see people who would be considered ""set in their ways"" forced to explore a side of themselves they never knew they had.  Just goes to show that you never stop learning about yourself.

I recommend this movie for everyone over the age of 45 and to all the young viewers: watch it, you'll be older someday too.  It might give you a new perspective on those of us who drive a little slower and talk a little too much.",1353974400,,1037,4.304123711340206

I watched it once, and then bought it, because it is a treasure that I could barely begin to take in in one viewing!

4883438,4,B005S9EJ14,I always admire Judi Dench and this one was no exception. It's a comedy about some people who happen to all decide to go to India for different reasons and happen to stay together at a hotel which to their surprise is nothing like what was promised in the brochure. They have interesting adventures adjusting to a new culture and end up falling in love with the country - most of them - in different ways. It's a good comedy for a couple of nice hours.

4883446,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie gives us a glimpse of the ways love manifests itself as we grow old and how we integrate our pasts into our dwindling present.  Every character in the cast is an iconic representation of an old woman or man coming to terms, or perhaps forming new terms, for this period of their lives.  It is certainly a movie for my generation and, hopefully, our children will watch and take a second look at us--the ones with wrinkles and double-chins who know what love is and need it just as much as we ever did.",1353801600,,512,4.322916666666667

4883453,5,B005S9EJ14,"Best movie I have seen in years.  All acting was top notch.  The plot was thorough and realistic.  Each character was fully fleshed out (love them or hate them).

This movie was clearly not written for the hormone ridden youth that most movies seem to be written for these days.  You will likely watch the movie in silence, but have quite a bit to say about it afterwards.  Good couples movie for couples that have some life experience under their belts.

Looks like it is a favorite hobby and pass time for western directors to highlight only the ugly face of India and deliberately ignore any thing that is good. The most recent trend is to have at least one scene where a westerner goes into a slum and eats food served by the dwellers there. Can guarantee it would ever happen in reality.

Each of the elderly English characters (with amazing performances) chooses a low-cost retirement in India, surrendering a familiar vision of their lives for the practical necessities of life in a (cheaper) foreign place.  The world they enter feels chaotic, boisterous and gorgeously colored, while presenting novel opportunities and temptations.  Set in the almost dreamlike hotel, and in its young manager's (Dev Patel of Slumdog Millionaire and Newsroom) dreamlike ambitions, each character's path unwinds to an unexpected result.

4883513,3,B005S9EJ14,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel(released Feb/12)stars some impressive British acting talent,such as Judi Dench as Evelyn Greenslade,Bill Nighy as Douglas Ainslie,Celia Imrie as Madge Hardcastle,Penelope Wilton as Jean Ainslie,Maggie Smith as Muriel Donnelly,Tom Wilkinson as Graham Dashwood,Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins,along with others. These talents alone would have assured success in any film they all appeared in at once,but the film almost derails itself with a sub plot of love between the hotel owner Sonny and his girlfriend,who must stand up to his domineering mother,and all the little nuances each character brings to the table,and which must be pieced together and tied up in the end. As the film rolls along we get an endless hopping from one person to the next and when any of the stellar British actors are not on screen,things tend to get slightly tepid. However the film finally manages to pull the entire story together in the end,as bitter sweet as it is.
The story finds one couple and five singles,going to a hotel in India,as the brochures of it look mighty appealing. Each one has their own travails and reasons for going. For the Ainslies,the husband had invested their entire retirement savings on his daughter's internet company,for start up funds,which has gone nowhere fast. With funds short,they decide to vacation at the Exotic Marigold. Evelyn is a widow which must sell her flat to pay her late hubby's bills. With what's left she decides to vacation. Madge is a single lady who is out looking for a mate,and decides India might be the change she needs. Muriel is in need of a hip replacement and the hotel is used to put her up as she convalesces. Graham is a newly retired judge who is sick and returns to the land he knew many years before. And finally Norman is an old bachelor looking for that one last good fling.
When the group arrives,they discover the hotel is a decrepit old thing run by a young man named Sonny,who took it over from his late father. Sonny is constantly looking for a cash influx to expand,but cannot get the backing of a local businessman. On top of this his love life is combative:with his mother. She wants an arranged marriage whereas he loves another girl and wants to marry her. Muriel is a crotchety old bird and at first talks very little to anyone. After her hip replacement she becomes friendly with one of the hotel servants and the film expands on their relationship. Mrs. Ainslie is a moaning Minnie to everyone within ear shot. She gets a crush on ex judge Graham but it becomes unfulfilled as Graham it turns out is gay. Evelyn gets a job in a local call center teaching the employees how to properly deal with English customers;which she loves. Both Madge and Norman both hunt for that certain love affair,with totally different tacks. The ex judge,seeks out and finds an old friend who he was closerthanthis with years before and they reunite.
When the film starts its descent towards the finale we find Sonny standing up to his mother and vowing to marry his sweetheart,as,it turns out,his father did for his own mother years before. Madge and Norman each find love in their own respective styles and stay on. Mrs. Ainslie finally leaves the hotel when her daughter sends some unexpected funds to them. Their marriage was on the rocks anyways and while she departs,he instead stays on. Douglas and Evelyn created a connection during their time together and he returns to her and asks her on a date. Muriel has been a busy beaver and has looked into the viability of the hotel,which Sonny's mother wanted to close. Muriel instead says the property is viable and sets about co-managing it with Sonny and it prospers. Finally,and unfortunately,Graham had a bad ticker and passes away after his reunion with his old and dear friend. His friend gives him a proper Hindu funeral.
The film has seven people,eight if you count Sonny,all with problems and travails to work out. That is alot of detail to introduce,tell and properly wrap up all within the just over two hour time frame. And as I said,when this great cast of veterans isn't on the screen,the movie slows down,as good as the Indian cast is. So what could/should have been a top notch character study film,almost gets derailed because of the amount it has to tell and the way it is ultimately told(edited).
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. The extras are two 2-3 minute glorified trailers on the film and commentary.
All in all this film is a film that should have been better than it was,but it just had too much to tell and wrap up. The British cast was nothing short of marvelous,but even they couldn't propel the film any higher because of the aforementioned faults. 3-3 1/2 stars.",1353369600,,4769,4.760869565217392

Reading the warm reviews is most depressing, for one realizes how shallow our culture is, believing that life is about having a good time, especially if this means sex.

If you like this movie then you will appreciate ""Enchanted April"" (1992).",1353196800,,921,4.603658536585366

But the plot is beyond cliche' and so ridiculously sentimental, I found myself rolling my eyes again and again at the stupid lines actors such as the wonderful Dame Judy Dench and Maggie Smith had to say. If you want a mindless ride through India, don't mind the stereotypical characters, and silly predictable plot, then you'll like this film. If not, then rent it...don't make the mistake I did when I bought the film on Amazon Instant.",1352419200,11,599,4.607476635514018
4883567,5,B005S9EJ14,"The cast of characters in this movie was absolutely stellar. Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith are just a few that I remember.  The story involves a group of retirees who are enticed to go and live in India at a run down hotel managed by a young man who is trying desperately to make a go of this business.  He also has his own concerns that include a domineering mother who doesn't feel he can succeed and a girlfriend that his mother won't accept.  The people at the hotel all have their own stories of course, and they are sometimes funny and at the same time sad.  There is the couple who have lost most of their investments and forced to live in an environment that the wife finds less than desirable.  Never mind that she won't even leave the hotel to explore all the nearby sites and absorb the culture.  As one of the characters put it, ""this is a country where life is a privilege not a right.""  There is so much to see and experience. Someone finds a job, another has hip surgery.  One man seeks a long lost love.  Two of the others try to find a way to end their lonliness.  Of course, all these people are brought together and make a difference in each other's lives.  Sometimes it doesn't work out but it becomes a learning process.",1352332800,,1248,4.2905982905982905

star studded cast could not help, leaving me to think it might have fared better under the skills of a different director, but it still falls back to a weak script,and,or story.

I say mature adults because I feel younger adults might find it dull or not ""get it.""I found the dialogue to be extremely well written and the acting superb. As I finished watching this movie, I felt completely lifted-up and inspired by the stories acted out in the film.

Just the idea that such a service could be ""outsourced"" is food for thought.  What is wrong with our ""developed"" countries that such an essential service could even be considered for outsourcing?  And then there were the intertwined lives of the many characters -- and how issues between and among them were resolved.  Thirdly -- one should appreciate how people adapted -- even though at the age when we think it is harder to adapt.

The film was over-the-top for me - fun, exhilarating and confirmed my belief that we can take-on with grace and courage any of life's challenge(s).  Whatever the age and stage they may befall us.
My favorite, all time, actor is always Bill Nighy - and he was superbly funny and touching and witty all wrapped up in his inimitable style.  Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are, as always, enchantingly divine to watch - and that's mainly because they always live the role - not act it.  The main messages: that of enduring friendships, zest for participating in life's adventures, along with just plain having fun - while in India, for, after all, India is India, not the United States.  Let's not forget that important element.  I have had the privilege and pleasure of moving many times during my life - most recently, 6 times since 2003, and always my first choices have unfolded.  So, the film gave me the inspiration that, perhaps, 6 months, or more, in India would be an adventure not-to-be-missed.  The India scenery is gorgeous as are the faces of India's people.  I knew I would love the film because I knew it was about taking chances - however, it's glowing and subtle messages are dazzlingly appropriate for the not so dazzlingly times we're living in today.

4883607,3,B005S9EJ14,"I have wanted to watch this movie since it came out last year. For some reason it only came to select theaters and none of them were near me. The pacing was slow but the energizing soundtrack made up for that. Most of the storylines were touching and easy to connect with. The cinematography is bold and pretty and gives you a feel of what India is like. Every member of the cast does a great job with their part. Especially Evelyn teaching customer service reps how to sound less robotic and unfeeling on the phone. Even though the premise is regarding oldish people who travel to India. I found a much deeper meaning. I may be the only who noticed, I notice weird stuff all the time. All the characters were looking for two basic things. The need to be loved through and through by at least one individual and the need find a healthy way to cope with chunks life takes from you, I think all ages can relate to that. One huge quibble I had was they should have added more to the story of the young exhuberant fellow running the hotel. I found his story flat and the other Indian character's even flatter. I know Indian people and they don't all sound like Apu from the Simpsons.",1351900800,,1179,4.339366515837104

As a mature woman, I was delighted to see characters who had wrinkles, sex drive, realistic conversations and the ability to grow and learn. Add to the talented cast a glorious backdrop and the color of India and you have an exceptional movie. Watch and enjoy.",1351728000,,490,4.51685393258427
4883621,2,B005S9EJ14,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is noteworthy basically because of the cast. Judi Dench would be interesting reading from a telephone directory and Bill Nighy is endearing no matter what. Tom Wilkison and Penelope Wilton are strong supporters.  And what can be said about Dame Maggie Smith that hasn't been said before? But the rest of the cast and the story line are not at all impressive. Who wants to watch a bunch of senior citizens discovering that the fabled benefits package the UK has promised for all its people isn't at all what they expected? Once the disappointment has set in, they all set off to India for a retirement they can afford. They become acquainted at the airport when it dawns on them that they must find their own way to the hotel despite the promises otherwise.

The hotel is another character in the plot as it battles Western expectations. While no one finds the Holiday Inn very appealing to any but the most pedestrian tastes, this place is a little too exotic for those used to indoor plumbing, standard electrical service, or even walls. A young man, very eager to recapture former glory, turns himself upside down to please his guests and this has its comical moments as he struggles to define all deficiencies as unexpected benefits in disguise. It is clear by the words he uses to describe his hotel (The Best Exotic...) that there will be something of a disconnect between the description and reality.

Wilkison is the only one familiar with the terrain as he is a closeted gay who once lived in the country. It's vaguely appealing as he explains politely what the customs are although few in his group find them appealing (think of the red hot cuisine). Penelope Wilton who plays the bullying senior we all have come to know and hate, harangues her hubby (the shy lovable type played by Nighy) to take her back immediately. No way, Jose. They invested their last pound on a daughter's start-up company leaving them financially depleted. The bigot, Maggie, can't find a thing to smile about but accidentally shows an unexpected respect for one of the Indian persona non gratas in that stratified world.

Each person struggles to right themselves in a foreign country so their declining years won't be the worst of their years. How likely do you think it that our gay fella will come out badly? hmmm? Some succeed and some don't but it's just too obvious who is who. There are some amusing scenes but as someone who just reached sixty, I find the rest is simply too real for comfort. I wish there was something encouraging in this mess but it's just not that good.",1351728000,4,2599,4.680525164113786

The hotel is advertised as a place of luxury and relaxation in which to retire. Not so when they get there, but they all seem to handle it well enough (except for one). Their stories, and their lives, intertwine with the owner of the hotel and his girlfriend. Judi Dench is phenomenal, as always. Bill Nighy is brilliant and so are all the rest of the cast. I recommend it highly and it's a movie I return to again and again in order to remind myself how life is not over when you turn 50, nor is finding love.",1351641600,,688,4.259541984732825

So right off the bat, if you're interested in a lighter movie, as a break from the usual murder/violence/sci-fi action animated content, this is a good candidate for you.

I would have liked to see the hotel manager's role developed a little more; he's talented and interesting, and I found myself hoping more time would be spent on his story line (and his girlfriend is a knock-out).

But this film is not all fluff and sunshine, which definitely improves the story - when has life for anyone ever been all fluff and sunshine?

4883634,5,B005S9EJ14,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was lovely to watch on several levels. The Scenery made the viewer feel like we were there. The actors each had characters with very different tales to reveal about themselves; and each story wove into the other throughout the story until the end. I felt an older person could relate to the feelings of the characters, but for the youth, I felt it was very well featured by the young hotel owner, with dreams(personal and professional) and obstacles. Obstacles were in EVERYONE'S way and somehow they were able to push each other through them. We can't go through life without help from someone(even total strangers; telling us ""WE CAN"" & ""It's never to late"" The collective talents were great to watch. Their acting experience showed. Everyone had their moment and each moment was worth watching. Even the character(s) I may not have like as much, I understood them, sympathized with them and that made them
easier to swallow or take in. In the final view of this movie, I really liked it. Its the sort of movie a viewer can watch more than once. I'd recommend it for a person who wants not just to be entertained, but to feel a STORY.",1351641600,,1167,4.642512077294686

I purchased it because I am a fan of Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench.  I have now watched it three times because I keep wanting to see certain passages again, like Maggie in the hospital gurney requesting her tea and wanting to see an English doctor or Judi trying to make sense of a computer.  The performance by the Indian actors is nothing short of brilliant, from the over enthusiastic young hotel owner to his sexy, beautiful girlfriend, her business minded brother, the over bearing and unforgiving future Mother in law, each and every one delivers an impeccable performance.  This is a movie in the successful Hollywood format of the 1940's where people left movie theatres uplifted.

The book had you feeling as if you knew each person and how their lives all came to be connected....the movie just throws them together - and then the changes that were made just took away from the story.

4883706,5,B005S9EJ14,"One of the best things about the British is that they always find ways to use their actors during long and distinguished careers, unlike the U.S. where we too often decide that actresses are over the hill at 30 (Sally Field playing Tom Hank's mother in ""Forest Gump"" when she was almost exactly the same age as her ""son"") or where we pair 60+ actors with 22 year-old ingenues in romantic comedies as if the actors don't look more like the ingenues' grandfathers than their lovers. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a slight movie in terms of plot and it is a little too neatly tied up at the end, but the performances of the seven wonders of the British acting tradition in this film, with the help of several talented younger Asian actors, make for an enjoyable experience and an acting lesson in how to play flawed (and sometimes not very likeable) characters with depth and compassion while avoiding the easy cliches the script might suggest. The film is often very funny, making use of British understated humor which depends more on character rather than situation.

4883736,3,B005S9EJ14,"With Judy Dench and Maggie Smith in a film about English people who come to stay  at a hotel in an exotic landscape, one is tempted to make comparisons with ""A Room With A View"";  you could, but that'd be like trying to link ""Doc Martin"" to ""Northern Exposure"", sure there are comparisons to be had, yet at the end it's an exercise in wishful thinking.  But don't think that this film doesn't measure up.

With each having his own reasons, a group of aging Brits find themselves staying at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, in Jaipur;  an old Raj Era hotel that may have started business as a palace, run by an earnest young man who's trying to succeed where his father's life dream failed:  Bring the hotel back to its glory, and make money, albeit as a home for seniors, in effect out-sourcing the West's old folk who can't afford to live with dignity in their own country.  The young man is Dev Patel, who at times seems the embodiment of a Disney animated character.  His persona is that of a sweet faced, earnest young man, but that facade breaks (frequently) and his eyes widen, he smiles broadly and reveals a goofier interior.  It reminds me of Shaggy, in his earlier work (""Carolina"") where the tough-cool reggae image would also crack, he'd throw his head back, roll his eyes and grin broadly;  it's an endearing trait in both.

The basic idea of the film is that a bunch of Westerners come to India to live out their lives, and die, and in the process discover an entirely new life they'd never imagined.  And for the most part that is the film, but there's a downside, sort of like the politician behind the ads:  Like entirely too many Western films, there is a not so subtle racism that permeates the film.  The Indians, in their own country, are clearly made out to be the lesser beings;  how they managed to build a civilization, let alone one of the world's booming modern economies; how Indian men stood up to their mothers, on behalf of their girl friends, or ran their businesses without the help of a kindly white person is anybody's guess.  You see it all the time on this side of the pond, with minorities in film and TV:  ""Northern Exposure"" and it's sub-caste natives;  African Americans get it all the time, playing the sage, the pimp, the maid---kindly and knowing; the fool, but almost never the equal.  In the end it makes us white folks look bad.

Having said that, if I walked out of every film that irritated me in one way or another, I'd have given up on films altogether by now.  I think the issue needs to be dealt with, and it would help if more people tagged the behavior when it's manifested.

The movie is very entertaining, romantic, and funny by turns;  the story unfolding mostly within the hotel, but there are wonderful street scenes that provide interest and color, and in some instances, glimpses of modern India, where a big new concrete tower rises amidst fields of trash and dirt;  with the tents of the workers making a temporary slum alongside (if we remember our ""Shantaram"").  It probably would have been better if the perspective had been reversed, with the white folks as incidentals and the Indians carrying more of the story, an Indian film in other words;  but for what it is, it is very watchable and would bear multiple viewings.

I should note that I watched the streaming version and the quality was quite good.",1350777600,,3371,4.538079470198675

This trek into the strange and unexpected is lead by a stellar cast of British actors each of who bring their own unique style to bear on the progress of the story.

Initially the lead characters are identified and their motives explained so the viewer understands, at least in part, the reasons these characters are making the decisions they make which take them to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. As the story unfolds the voyage of discovery begins for the various characters that are drawn together by circumstances and then attempt to make the best of the unexpected developments with which they are assailed.

The movie was filmed in India and is filled with the sights and sounds of India. It is a movie of survival, the survival of the various retirees who seek a haven from high costs, and even the survival of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel itself. Who will survive and who will perish? That is the story the movie tells in a distinctly non-Hollywood manner.

The movie is filled with color, great acting, and immerses the viewer in the chaos of the streets of India; a culture that is both alien and yet somewhat familiar.

Some of my favorite actors were in this movie and it lived up to the reputations they each had built over their years of stage and screen. The story will make you despair, and laugh and cry, and wonder what your elder years will be like. But the realism and simplicity with which the story was told will make you feel really good.

The background noise is loud and ugly and one simply wishes for it to cease. Their arrival is chaotic in a bad sense, the movie doesn't take long enough to make the few points it has to make, and the Indian proprietor hops and jumps around for no particular reason.

4883771,5,B005S9EJ14,"I can't understand why some reviewers want to just pick this movie apart! I watch movies to be entertained...not to be educated, and certainly not to be made to feel bad at the end of it. I already know that a hip replacement surgery is no piece of cake, and that many elderly people end up in nursing homes. I'd rather watch a movie that portrays a happy alternative than one that grinds home the more common reality.

I saw the movie (twice!) in a theater, and then bought the DVD. I've watched it several times and still enjoy it. I've recommended it to many friends. I loved all the actors and their portrayals. Do I think I can move to India and live like this? No! Do I wish I could? Kind of...

For those who think the story should be more realistic, I recommend you read the book that inspired the movie. ""Inspired"" is the key word here, because the book by Deborah Moggach is very different and much more complex. The book's tone and characterizations are much ""grittier"". There are quite a few more characters in the book, and the book's focus is not on Evelyn's or Graham's characters.

4883781,4,B005S9EJ14,"THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is proof positive that you don't need all the things Hollywood thinks you do to make a great movie. You don't need naked actors, explosions, violence or nubile young starlets. When you make a movie with heart, with feeling and emotion, you make something that can stand the test of time rather than just the number of weeks it can hold a top spot on the charts.

The plot behind the story involves a number of elderly Brits who for one reason or another find themselves seeking a different means of living on what little they have. Evelyn (Dame Judi Dench) has just lost her husband only to find he left her with enough debt that she must sell their flat. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge who decides the time is right to retire before he becomes the old fogey giving a boring retirement speech. Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are a retiring couple who may have lost everything investing in their daughter's internet company. Norman (Ronald Pickup) is an older gent wanting to feel young just one more time. Madge (Celia Imrie) is an woman searching for one last rich husband. And Muriel (Maggie Smith) is an elderly woman in need of a hip replacement who can either wait 6 months or get immediate attention in India, the location that all of these people decide to go to.

Having read about the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel via brochure, they become traveling companions on their way to a new adventure. Unfortunately the hotel isn't quite what it pretended to be. Sonny (Dev Patel) is the son of the now deceased owner who is trying to make the hotel what his father once dreamed of. But rather than just becoming a place for tourist, the hotel caters to the elderly looking for a place to stay either short term or until the end. But none here are close to that, at least not in spirit.

Each character has their own story. Evelyn is the center piece, giving us background as she starts a blog to let folks back home know of her adventures. She goes so far at to take a job helping a phone sales group understand how to talk to English people. Norman is there to rekindle something that happened in his past, something that happened in this very town.

Douglas finds himself fascinated with the area and attempts to absorb each and every item he can see and experience. His wife Jean is just the opposite, choosing to stay in the hotel and complain about each and every thing that happens. She's an unhappy woman and lets everyone know about it. Madge and Norman both gravitate to the local posh club in town where they hope to meet someone and find their fortunes at getting lucky improve. Muriel is another complainer but hers is more along the lines of prejudices against the people of India that are based more on what she's heard than what she's experienced.

Interwoven in the guests stories is that of Sonny who has chosen to make his father's dream come true. In love with a local girl that his mother decides is unsuitable for him to marry; he must either decide to follow his heart or his family.

The movie moves along at an even pace, never rushing through one story or another and blending each of them together smoothly rather than place each in a time limit only to go to the next. Even though they all have their tale to tell, the fact that they've chosen to become best friends (in some cases eventually) shows who these people are. And while their trip to this country at first seemed due to a case of need, they soon find themselves enchanted by the area they've chosen as their new home.

The sights and sounds of India are on display here from moment to moment. Not just the grand and glorious colors and images that seem beautiful but the poorer sections as well. This feels more like the real India and not just a travelogue showing us the best. And the characters experience it just as much as the viewer.

The idea of getting older, of not knowing what your future holds or how long you have to enjoy that future is what makes this film work. We're presented with different ways of looking at life here, good and bad, and how the characters choose what path to take. The acting is superb but why wouldn't it be with the talent pool collected here. Not one actor slips or slides in this film where each shines instead.

It's time for a feel good movie. And this one suits that need. It won't have you sitting on the edge of your seat, but it will hold your attention from start to finish.

About two months after the release, we finally found that it was showing at a theater 75 miles from our home.  We drove the 75 miles, watched the movie, and loved it.  The casting company deserves a special round of applause.  I don't believe they could have picked a better cast.  It is a wonderful, funny, sad, laugh out loud, get misty eyed movie.

At least I did. Now I have to pay for Plan B, get supplemental medical insurance, dental, and prescription insurance. Who knows, I will eventually have to worry whether I need to sell my house and move into senior living. But most of all, I have to think about what do I really want to do in my retirement years.  Too much to think about.  Almost all of this is covered in the movie and it was wonderful to see how difference individuals handled or didn't handle these waning year.

The soundtrack, cinematography, costuming, sets were all well done. It's presentation of human and cultural issues is both enlightening and entertaining.  This film succeeds because of a fantastic cast and a poignant and seamlessly interwoven screenplay.  There are no weak links.  The conclusion is edifying and uplifting.

4883870,5,B005S9EJ14,"Life isn't always what it seems, and it doesn't always turn out the way we had envisioned or hoped. In this movie, we watch the inner lives of several characters ""of a certain age"" unfold and expand. With the bloom of youth past, retirement upon them and circumstances inducing radical change, all of them decide to retire in India at the Marigold Hotel. When they arrive, they find that the hotel isn't the luxurious retreat for the elderly that was described in the brochures that led them there. It is not without its charms, however, and the manner in which the retirees meet both the good and the bad of their new home lays the groundwork for their blended individual stories. The dialogue is excellent, the cast and the acting is brilliant, and the message is hopeful without violating believability. Baby boomers will see themselves in one or more of the characters' situations, and they will come away from the film with a renewed sense of hope and worth.

The film's perspective on two ways to grow older is beautifully executed. Not all the characters ""make it."" Given the same opportunity for adjustment and change as their companions, a couple of them cannot forgive, hope or move forward. Others, however, find a new beginning by embracing change and welcoming a future which is completely different from the past they left behind.

In all, the movie is provocative. It is funny, sad, engaging and substantive. A refreshing change from saccharine happily-ever-after or hopeless all-is-doomed films, this is a thinker's must-see for people in their sixties and a please-see for the young. (The young people in this movie are wonderful, too.) Kudos to the writers, producers, directors and actors for a job superbly done.",1349827200,,1732,4.928082191780822

4883875,5,B005S9EJ14,"With the tag line, ""Everything will be alright in the end and if it is not alright it is not the end"" we are assured that there will be no tragedies in this movie. Most older people have had enough tragedies in their real lives not to need to see others suffer for entertainment. Real life almost never lives up to the promises and we are lucky if we end up somewhere that is at least interesting and interested in improvement. So even with the cliched characters, unlikely coincidences and improbably timed events it is a pleasure to watch this group struggle to deal with the situation as it is. Even the inevitable death is well timed to avoid complications.

This movie has hardly left my DVD player since I bought it a few days ago. I have researched locations and the ages of the actors online and watched Evil Under the Sun where a younger Maggie Smith plays a very different type of innkeeper. So I had to give it 5 stars even though I recognize the flaws. There are a few places that I now skip over and others that always amuse me. I recommend pausing the DVD to check out the ""Have you lost your vigor"" poster in the clinic when Norman goes to get a little help. When Sunaina suggests to Evelyn that she imagine her listeners naked I am inclined to suspect that I would be unable to speak because I would be staring at her brother Jay (Sid Makeer) with my mouth open.

If there is a cliche that irritates me here it is the idea that one must have a lover to be happy. This is exemplified when Madge Hardcastle confides that she is afraid that she is no longer attractive to men and ""what else is there""? The answer is ""lots of things"". This may be why several people have found the characters of Madge and Norman less satisfying than the ones who have other interests. Rather than simple wish fulfillment the others find new truths and competencies. Douglas discovers that he can be handy, Evelyn and Muriel discover that they still have value and Graham learns that he has been living with an assumption that has cost him a lot of pain. Even the dreadful Jean learns what she really wants.

And so all who live do so happily ever after.",1349740800,,2148,4.365

4883877,5,B005S9EJ14,"Though it's obvious that the full depth and range of life experience cannot be portrayed in a film, I loved watching this movie, and felt that it skillfully pointed with wisdom and insight into many dimensions not only of aging, but of life's continual cirlce of connection, loss, transition and growth, and re-connection.  Films can point into one's own experience, where one can then reflect and more deeply explore that journey.  Overall, I would give this film 5 stars.",1349740800,,473,4.974683544303797

The premise, essentially the outsourcing of the latter portion of our lives to a different country, may or may not seem a little strange, but what makes this movie so good is how it makes you feel.  The actors are all fabulous in their respective roles and somewhere deep in you, not matter whether you want it there or not, they touch a nerve that makes you feel good.

4884081,5,B005S9EJ14,"I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. The concept of a group of senior citizens moving from the UK to live in a hotel in modern day India, appealed to me.

I'm a big fan of Judi Dench and I loved how her character changed from being sad (before she left the UK) then taking on new challenges, and how she fared. They all had different reasons for going to India.

At first the retirees found it difficult to adapt, and the hotel not quite as they expected, but most of them got into the swing of things. As one of them said you have to go with the flow.

I don't want to give any of the story away, but something sad happened on the 45th day of their stay, I was watching the movie to cheer me up! By the end of the movie I'd almost forgotten and I felt happier.

I'm glad I bought the movie. It was good to see Judi and the other actors British actors I hadn't seen for a long time. It was also nice to get a glimpse of what it's like there today.",1349654400,,973,3.9238578680203045

4884084,4,B005S9EJ14,"with no glossing over the rough edges of adapting to change when you are older.  I was impressed at how successfully the movie avoided being a stereotype about ""old people; aren't they cute, funny, dumb, etc."".  This is a stellar cast, doing what they do best, making you care about them.  There are sticky social issues addressed within the movie, which I didn't expect, but were played to perfection by Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.  Judi Dench and Bill Nighy were fantastic, along with the other supporting cast.  Now I am in that ""older"" age range, so I may have some subconcious bias.  I thought it was a very entertaining and in a way, uplifting, movie.  The premise of bringing strangers together in a place that is new to them has been done to death, but this movie focused more on the people themselves than the surroundings.  They develped the characters well and with this ensemble cast, it was an interesting, engaging movie for me.

There are no special effects, fight scenes, or explosions, other than the emotional ones between two people.  If you enjoy reading a good story or book on a weekend afternoon, this movie will make a nice substitute.  Younger people interested in literature will probably also enjoy it, but if your family are more entertained by the big event type movies, just rent it for yourself.",1349654400,,1330,4.739130434782608

The characters are well acted and nuanced (some slightly more than others).  The Indian characters are not ignored, in terms of the above.  The basic plot is that a number of older adults are forced to move to India, for financial reasons.  Most of them dread it, but adapt quite well, pretty much.  Each character or couple has its own background and plot line, which intersect to some interesting effects.
This movie will probably appeal more to adults than teens, but not because of any fault of the movie!",1349654400,,623,4.669724770642202

I have seen this movie 3 times since it was first in theatre's and still enjoy the adventure they shared with the audience.

4884278,4,B005S9EJ14,"In ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"" seven British retirees fall for an Internet come-on that advertises a reasonably priced, grand and peaceful retreat in Jaipur, India.  After an exhausting trip, the travelers finally reach their destination, only to learn that the retreat is far from grand and not particularly peaceful.  The hotel is rather decrepit, and the surrounding area is teeming with bicyclists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, beggars, children at play, and sidewalk vendors loudly hawking their wares.

John Madden directs with a sure touch, eliciting superb performances from his stellar cast.  Judi Dench is the recently widowed Evelyn; she is eager to manage on her own after decades of relying on her husband.  Tom Wilkinson is Graham, a high court judge with a secret that has weighed on his mind for years.  Maggie Smith, the never married Muriel, is in India to have inexpensive hip replacement surgery; she is an unabashed racist who makes no secret of her bigotry.  Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are Douglas and Jean, an unhappily married couple who stay together more out of habit than desire.  Celia Imrie is Madge, a lonely woman who craves male companionship, and Ronald Pickup is Norman, who is desperate to snuggle up to an attractive female.  The guests are greeted at the Marigold Hotel by its irrationally exuberant manager, Sonny, played to the hilt by Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fame.  Sonny is trying to obtain funding so that he can transform the hotel into the beautiful retirement facility that currently exists only in his imagination.  Unfortunately, his overbearing mother is determined to take him back to New Delhi and away from his sexy girlfriend, Sunaina.

The screenplay by Ol Parker is uneven; there are melodramatic and far-fetched elements throughout the film that require a sizeable suspension of disbelief.  Nevertheless, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is terrific entertainment, with its colorful palette that shows off India's energy and spirit.  There are quite a few deliciously humorous scenes.  For instance, Judi Dench educates young Indian call-center workers on how to handle overseas calls with tact, grace, and humanity, instead of speaking robotically from a script.  Other funny bits include Norman trying to convince a young woman that he would be a good catch and Sonny's mother loudly browbeating her son in public.  The film is poignant in its depiction of the humiliation and physical deterioration that can make old age so daunting.  Muriel reveals her somewhat gloomy history to a woman who speaks only Hindi; Madge gloomily contemplates her solitary future; and Douglas and Jean finally acknowledge that they have grown apart.  The feel-good conclusion is contrived, but the acting is so wonderful that audiences will be thrilled to watch a movie about real people, instead of superheroes, trying to cope with life's disappointments and daring to embrace its undreamed of possibilities.",1349568000,,2967,5.261146496815287

Apparently very few movie makers want to do a movie exclusively about older people (one example of how to do it well, The Bucket List) because here we have a silly side tale of romance and parental disapproval suddenly appearing. As if that weren't bad enough, it quickly begins to build romantic connections among the elders too, even a gay one (to make it up-to-date, I suppose). Then, to keep from offending anyone, they kill off the gay man so they don't have to take that storyline anywhere meaningful. It was like watching a bad episode of Three's Company with wrinkles.

The resort definitely looked like a dump when they got there and I doubt I could have stayed there one night, especially if not secure and no closed windows.

Not to be so harsh on the gay population but sorry, I can not relate to it.  There was possibly some good acting, but I could not get past the sad and doomed story line to enjoy any of it.

A formula box of clich/stereotyped characters.

  Evelyn Greenside (played by Judi Dench) is a housewife who was recently widowed. In addition to her grief, her husband's death has left her with massive debts. While discussing her husband's account with a representative of her internet service provider, she causes an abrupt change in tone when she informs the person on the other end of the phone, whose Indian accent is easily noticeable, that her husband is dead. We are later introduced to a High Court judge named Graham Dashwood. Dashwood (played by Tom Wilkinson) is on his way to the most recent in what seems to be an endless series of retirement parties. He's dreading the event a great deal and, rather than suffer through the festivities, he simply says, ""This is the day"" as a way of announcing his own retirement and then leaves the party without another word. Next, we have the Ainslies. Douglas Ainslie (played by Bill Nighy) and his wife Jean (played by Penelope Wilton) are exploring a number of less-than-enticing bungalows where they might spend their golden years. They'd hoped for something grander, but invested a large portion of their savings in their daughter's internet business and have yet to see that business turn a profit. Muriel Donnelly (played by Maggie Smith) is a cantankerous former housekeeper who needs a hip replacement but finds the wait, cost, and personnel at her local hospital unappealing. All these characters are made aware, in varying ways, of a seemingly beautiful retirement community in India named The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful. However, when they arrive, they soon find out that Sonny, the hotel's young and enthusiastic manager (played by Dev Patel), has misrepresented the accommodations at the hotel. He neglected to mention the hotel's shabby appearance, failing plumbing, and non-functioning phone service.

  Now I failed to introduce two other characters in the story. They are single by choice and have come to India looking for romance. Without cluing you in to the ending, the film avoids the obvious cliche of the two finding love in each other's arms while still allowing them to find contentment. For that reason and others, I loved this film. There are twists, surprises, happy endings, not-so-happy endings. All that merely punctuates the brilliant portrayals offered by a cast that already has many on their respective resumes. The inexplicably optimistic character played by former Slumdog Millionaire and now supporting actor on HBO's The Newsroom, Dev Patel is a constant source of amusement.

4884376,3,B005S9EJ14,"Contrary to many reviews of the film, I felt that this movie is mainly about old age and retirement in western societies today in the context of the changes brought about by globalization. The film has a great cast of elderly English actors such as Judi Dench and Bill Nighy and the story line is pleasant if not gripping.

A group of retired English people decide to move to Jaipur in northern India for various reasons, but primarily financial ones. The film is about their encounter with India which is told in an engaging manner. India, with its color and people, also turn out to be a significant actor in the film.

I won't go into the story as it has been told in many other reviews. What I found interesting was the idea of changing times in Britain today and its impact on the elderly. Unlike the past, the welfare state is slowly being chipped away in the era of globalization, leaving elderly people now waiting for six months to get a hip replacement and others not being able to lead a comfortable living with the money that they have left in retirement. The movie dabbles with the idea that perhaps senior people may be better off moving to foreign lands where their pounds and dollars go a lot farther. It suggests that even though they will have to come to terms with substantial cultural shocks initially, it is worth the effort and that it is never too late to learn to effect a change in one's life. Since the era of baby boomers is reaching the retirement age, this is a very relevant and topical film because baby boomers also have been adventurous travellers to the east in their twenties. So, they may be well equipped to implement the message of this film.

The film has got its usual cliches about untouchability in India, the squalor and poverty of India as well as race prejudice among the older generation of Britain. But overall, it is a feel-good film and treads lightly on the negatives of its characters. It is enjoyable to watch.",1348876800,3,1962,4.536723163841808
4884377,5,B005S9EJ14,"I must say, this film took me completely by surprise - and in a wonderful way!  The marketing had led me to think this was a comedy about a handful of older Brits who moved to India and then experienced culture shock in a slapstick way.  To be honest, with such a scenario I wouldn't have gotten this film at all were it not for the cast.  I am such a huge fan of all of these actors, so I figured anything with Judy Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Maggie Smith was worth seeing - no matter how lame the material.  Was I ever wrong about the material and the story!

This is an incredible film about re-purposing one's life, about taking risks and making changes no matter what age and about that even when things don't turn out as expected, often better things come instead.

Set in India, the film is so visually stunning and I loved the soundtrack so much, I ordered that too.  Most important, it deals with change, with loss, with acceptance, with redemption and forgiveness, with holding on to what matters and letting go to what doesn't.  The trick, of course, is for each viewer to figure out those in his/her own life.  Each of the characters in this film must figure these out too.  In less deft hands, this COULD have been ""strange old Brits in a strange new land,"" but thanks to a great story and a great director, and such a strong, expert cast, this movie is so much more.

Although I am not yet the age of the characters, this film moved me tremendously and gave me such hope and optimism for that rapidly approaching time.  My new mantra is ""Everything turns out all right in the end.  If it's not all right, it's not the end.""",1348876800,,1647,4.3257328990228014

As a reviewer you just never know what you are going to get. My expectations are never high and I love being pleasantly surprised.  This movie surprised me!

Storyline by Maria We meet all of our players at the beginning and find out why all these people will be heading to India to live out their golden years. Whether it is because they are newly widowed, looking for something new, receiving a hip replacement or a slew of other reasons they all meet at the airport and our story begins..

The hotel isn't quite what they expected and is run by a young entrepreneur named Sonny played by Dev Patel. Sonny has a vision and explains to his mother that he is ""outsourcing old age"" because ""there are many countries where they don't like old people"".

My favorite quote from the movie comes from Sonny who is always optimistic; ""Everything will always be alright in the end and if it is not alright than trust me, it is not yet the end.""

Actors: Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson are wonderful! Judi Dench as Evelyn the widowing who is trying to find herself, gets a job and enjoys the beauty around her. Loved her character. Oh and Maggie Smith as the prejudice Muriel, is one feisty spitfire.

Location: I loved it! From overcrowded buses, rickshaws, mopeds, and colorful clothing and buildings. The landscape is another character adding to the beauty of the movie. See this movie and be surprised!",1348704000,,1565,4.591397849462366
4884380,5,B005S9EJ14,"My husband and I saw ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in our local theater over the summer, and we both agree that it was the best movie we saw this year. After all, with both Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, how could it be anything but wonderful.

A group of cash-poor retirees looking for an affordable retirement choice head from cool and civilized London to the hot and crowded streets of India. Depending on a colorful (and somewhat imaginative brochure), they expect a luxury hotel complete with all the amenities. Instead, they find a rather run-down hotel, once a grand dame, but now a faded version of her former self. There are few amenities other than the dreams of its young and inexperienced proprietor.

Many movies use the theme of a group of individuals from disparate backgrounds being forced together, but this film handles the conflict beautifully. Both conflicts and alliances are formed, hearts and dreams are broken, and, like the Phoenix, this hotel rises from the proverbial ashes to relive her glorious past. There are touches of both love and death, hope and loss, and beginnings as well as endings. Oh, and most of this happens to people who are on the other side of fifty, just to prove that not all interesting things happen to the young.

In general, I am NOT a movie watcher (my husband will watch and love just about anything) and we don't even own a DVD/Blu-Ray player, but we just may need to buy one (along with a flat screen TV because we still have an old, small CRT) because I would really like to own this movie.

This movie was ""Slumdog Millionaire"" meets ""Cocoon"". I found it a witty comedy with a great story.  It's too bad I could not associate myself with anyone...save the hotel owner.

The movie shows a ""never give up,"" and ""it's never too late,"" attitude.  It's a film about people finding themselves, after pretending to be someone else (wife, mother, husband), for most of their lives.  It's a movie about making amends, facing the truth, letting go and healing.  It's about taking a stand. It's about finding new love and reigniting love that was lost.

My immediate reaction had been that this is a movie that I wanted to see over and again, if just for the pure pleasure in seeing people who can prove that it's good to be over sixty and be able to explore new horizons. For me, this is unquestionably one of the best movies of the year.

Director John Madden's comedy about English retirees in India is a fascinating mix of both the familiar and the exotic. Ol Parker's screenplay is an adaptation from British author Deborah Moggach's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/These-Foolish-Things/dp/0701176202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">These Foolish Things</a>&nbsp;(2004), and the casting is true perfection. It begins in the UK with brief sketches of seven British senior citizens, which sets the stage.

We find Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) on the phone in her London flat, trying to communicate with a robotic operator at an Indian call center. She's a recent widow and is forced to sell her home after learning that her deceased husband had misused their life savings. It's Evelyn's blog entries, read aloud as narrative, that set the film's timeline.

There's Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a xenophobic, crabby shrew, a never-married retired housekeeper bound to her wheelchair. She needs a hip replacement, and makes the trip because in India the surgery will be cheaper and doesn't require a month long wait. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are an argumentative couple that sank their nest egg into their daughter's failing start-up company.

Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) and Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) are two singles looking for a change from the older British dating scene. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) is a retired judge with a guilty past who grew up in Jaipur, and is returning there for the first time since his youth.

All seven are drawn to ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the elderly and beautiful"" in Jaipur, India, based on an advertisement inspired more by the proprietors' hopes than on reality. The seven seniors travel to India, and as we find out, the hotel is anything but the Best or Exotic.

It's here at the Marigold Hotel that they meet their host, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), a nave, completely disorganized yet highly enthusiastic young man. Must admit that I had to stifle my laughter in the theater and again when viewing the DVD, watching Sonny trying to explain to his guests that the hotel has no working telephones and that some rooms are without doors, something that had been neglected ahead of time. He is the film's comic lead, and his often-hyperactive performance often borders on pure slapstick. His exclamation was perfect:

""Everything will be all right in the end... if it's not all right then it's not the end.""

Sonny is under extreme pressure from his arrogant, domineering mother to give up the hotel as a lost cause and go along with an arranged marriage in Delhi. But complicating matters, Sonny is in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae), a call center worker. It gets interesting (and a bit ironic) when Evelyn takes a job in the call center instructing the workers how to speak to British people on the phone... classic Judi Dench.

Watching Muriel's gradual transformation from a racist and crabby shrew to a caring and sensitive woman may have stretched credibility a bit. But considering the never-married housekeeper background of her character, it's something that few besides Maggie Smith could pull off so well.

The overall plot is beautifully interwoven with the subplots, and viewers will be treated to some mild surprises. Without dropping any spoilers, watch for Douglas (Bill Nighy) having a blast exploring the nearby temples and such, yet that does have its results with his wife. The antics of Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) in their quests for romance are hilarious in parts. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) offers a touching performance on many levels as he proceeds with his personal quest.

If there was any disappointment at all for this viewer, it was the hope that somewhere and at some point, Bill Nighy would break out of playing his role as a browbeaten husband and burst into that mad aging rocker that he did to well in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually/dp/B00005JMFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually</a>, but we can't have everything.

It produces some real laughs and offers truly brilliant performances from a highly experienced cast. Peppered with its pungent illustration of Jaipur's jam-packed streets and the rest of the scenery, it's a heartwarming, captivating and even inspiring leisurely paced comedy. Its optimism and claim that it's never too late to leave your comfort zone and explore new horizons makes it a joy for all except diehard gerontophobics.

4884399,5,B005S9EJ14,"The ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" BEMH, is a film for all generations.  Please set aside any & all prejudices.  I did not rent this movie for myself.  My wife is a Judi Dench fan, as well as many of the dramas/comedies one watches on PBS.  I decided to watch a few moments of this 2 hour movie & found - a bit of me, and a bit of friends, family, co-workers and life.  Face it, you have to retire.  Will your retirement income leave you broke, or living a life-style of pinching pennies.  Each actor was super.  I'm good at predicting movies, but I was surprised & pleased.  I will purchase this for my personal collection, as well as buy the book the movie is based upon. I found myself writing bits of the ""nuggets"" of wisdom this movie shares.  BEMH allows you to lose yourself in the movie, but it also awakens feelings we will all eventually face.  If you are married, have a GF/BF, partner or lover, you need to share this experience.  Again, set all prejudices aside.  Have no expectations.  Don't try to anticipate anything.  In our current dismal economy & world that feels like it is sinking, BEMH shows you that life doesn't have to be a futuristic, dismal drama.  People, can come together in unlikely places & life becomes more than 9-5, a gold watch, and sitting around waiting for life to happen.  This is A TRUE 5 STAR film.",1348358400,3,1339,4.4
4884400,3,B005S9EJ14,"The movie is supposedly based on the book of the same name.  Aside from sharing the same title, a few of the same characters and the setting in India, however, the two have little in common. In this case the movie is far superior to the book, which is muddled, disconnected and populated by a mlange of characters, most of whom, thankfully, never made it into the movie.

Despite the best efforts of the screenplay writers to rescue a tedious and confused novel, it is the excellent cast of actors who make the movie worthwhile. I suppose the intention was to focus on the trials and tribulations of the elderly as they come to terms with the sordid reality of their past lives and the prospect of making the most of the little time they have left. Instead we seem to be faced with a bunch of whining, self-absorbed, petulant and obnoxious Brits who by the movie's conclusion are supposedly transformed into loving, caring individuals (for the most part) who teach the poor inadequate Indians how to sell things by telephone, how to run a hotel and how to stand up to domineering mothers so that love can conquer all. Clearly, despite all evidence to the contrary, the British still think they have so much to teach the world while they coincidentally continue to shoulder their long-standing, self-assigned White Man's Burden.

Despite the cast of excellent, well-known British actors who stole the limelight in terms of credit, I enjoyed the performance of Dev Patel more than the others.

Interesting also that in the novel it was the lecherous & creepy heterosexual Norman who died in a brothel, while in the movie Norman finds respectability and true love, but the one gay character is killed off.",1348272000,7,1702,4.759322033898305

4884436,5,B005S9EJ14,"Let me say right now that this is coming from someone looking down the sights of a very big geriatric gun.

This is undeniably one of the best movies of the year.

A number of older retirees, for a number of reasons, decides on India as the place where they will live out their golden years...some with more acceptance than others.

This film presents us with performances from some of the premier British actors of our times. Judi Dench, Grande Dame of all British performance art, is a widow facing complete dissolution owing to the demise of her spouse, who has run everything; Tom Wilkinson, a leading barrister, has reached the end of playing footsie with bureaucracy; Muriel (Maggie Smith) needs an expensive hip replacement, which can be managed far more efficiently, not to mention cheaply, in Jaipur. Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton) are facing placement in a restricted home for the old and incompetent; Norman (Ronald Pickup) is a lonely elder gent who just wants to find a compatible lady. In desperation, they turn to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful in Jaipur, India - a place where, the brochure assures, they can live out their golden years in comfort.

The establishment presents more challenges, inevitably, than are assured in the flyer. Things don't work; rooms have not been lived in in apparent decades; difficulties in cultural assimilation have not been addressed. However that is, some of the senior recruits dive into their new environment with enthusiasm, while others look upon their surroundings with little less than horror. One in particular has lived here before, and his attempts to revisit the well-remembered locations of his youth are bittersweet at the finest. One, who arrives a confirmed bigot, evolves in the most lovely way into an informed and sympathetic advocate. And all, apparently, experience an epiphany of restricted values, with the possible exception of one lady who simply cannot evolve into a new frame of thinking.

I found myself numerous times on the verge of tears, of affinity, of you-go, of understanding. When you reach a certain age, you begin to weigh your options; I can't deny that I've thought about exotic locales that are purported to be very reasonable to live in - but the thought of uprooting myself to put down roots in an entirely different culture is daunting. Judi Dench's embracing of the life in India is refreshing to say the  least.

Dev Petel (Slumdog Millionaire)as the proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has his own problems to work through, with a domineering mother who aspires for a more advantageous union for her third son, while he has already decided that he wants nothing less than Sunaina (Tena Desae) who is a lowly worker at a call center.

This is a most involving film.  I never realized two hours had passed, and was truly invested in the convoluted lives of both the inhabitants of the Marigold Hotel and its hapless and striving proprietor. Maggie Smith in particular, Grande Dame who should be knighted, if that's possible, is particularly intriguing to watch; her evolution from confirmed bigot to informed lady is beautiful to watch.

I cannot invest too much credit upon this film. It is one of the best I have seen in years. Enjoy it with an open heart and an open mind, and thoroughly enjoy the performances of several established masters of the craft of acting.",1348185600,3,3418,4.908145580589255

4884438,5,B005S9EJ14,"From the assured director's hands of John Madden (The Debt, Shakespeare in Love, Ethan Frome, Mrs. Brown, Captain Corelli's Mandolin, Proof, etc) comes this warmly humorous and genuinely nostalgic film adapted by Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's novel ""These Foolish Things"". Boating one of the finest casts of veteran actors from England it is a film that pays attention to the lives and emotions of senior citizens  - and has a terrific time in the process.

A group of British retirees decide to ""outsource"" their retirement to less expensive and seemingly exotic India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways.  The story begins in London where the brief but necessary groundwork for our group of elder citizens is established - the frustrations of retirement, the death of a husband, the crumbling of a marriage of convenience, and the need for feeling physically attractive when facing a mirror. Once our entourage arrives in Jaipur (amongst the squalor of poverty matched by the sense of freedom of living in the moment) they are greeted by the young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, whose enthusiasm and optimism suffuse the entire film.

The new tenants are a varied bunch: Muriel (Maggie Smith) has come to India (despite her hideous bigotry and racism) for a hip replacement, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a new widow unable to afford a retirement home in England and longing for adventure, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and his chronically cranky wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) likewise cannot afford the embarrassment and finances of a British retirement facility, Norman (Ronald Pickup) who cannot `face' aging and the lack of feminine accompaniment, Madge (Celia Imrie) who longs to discover a man to love, and Graham (Tom Wilkerson) a gay man whose lived in the closet in England forever guilty about his true love he left in India many years ago.  Stir this kettle, add romance (not only from Sonny and his lower caste girlfriend Sunaina -Tena Desae, but also the awakening of new love in most all of the tenants o the Marigold), and out pours a film of physical beauty, memorable bits of philosophy from both the old and young, and a sense of discovery which is always at the end  - `or it isn't the end.' Highly recommended for old AND young.  Grady Harp, September 12",1348099200,,2438,4.931707317073171

4884440,4,B005S9EJ14,"Given the top quality cast in this film, I was relatively confident that a blind buy purchase of this Blu-ray (from another retailer, with apologies to my friends here at my favorite online retailer) was a worthwhile investment into something I hoped to be able to sit and enjoy watching with wife 2.0  Thankfully we weren't disappointed.

After putting the disc in the player and seeing a couple of trailers for other films (The Descendants and We Bought a Zoo among those), I started playing this film and was immediately brought into a very brief introduction of the cast of characters that was going to be brought together on their adventures on where/how they'd spend the rest of their lives.

Honestly, what happens to all of us as we age and get towards retirement is something I think we all somewhat fear, especially if we've not saved for our golden years.  In this particular film, we see a U.K. perspective on these events, with the various characters all basically forced into trying to stretch their limited resources because of a variety of circumstances.  In one case, it was due to investments, in another because of the death of a loved one.  Each member (or team) of the cast we're introduced seemed to have a different reason, but in the end, we knew that all would wind up at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, a promised life of luxury and opulence in beautiful India, where just a little money could be stretched a long, long way.

Of course things are never quite what they seem and once the members of the party arrive in India they find the need to arrange alternate transport to get to their new home and even worse, once there they are greeted by a young man that is the Owner/Manager of a hotel that has certainly seen better days and is not the Best Exotic anything, at least not in the present time.  The Owner/Manager promises that better times are coming, plans for future improvements and expansion are very much on his mind, but getting there may take some time and for that he must beg for patience from his guests.

Several events are set up early in the film that telegraph future situations and over the course of the film a viewer would, I expect, feel a strong sense of predictability and expectation.  Realistically, this is a film that does go where one expects.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a case of being hard to find surprise in, and for that I've lowered my rating a bit.  On the other hand, I would likely give this film a higher rating if it was possible to do so without giving what I would term a perfect mark.

The performances were all top notch, and the introduction to life in India for those that aren't familiar with it is always interesting to me.  In that area, this film reminded me of the very nice film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outsourced-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B004089D7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outsourced - Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;(which inspired a forgettable NBC TV series).

Anyway, this film did make for a decent nights entertainment for myself and my wife and I look forward to catching it later with some friends as well, meaning that I think there's some replay value here.  While the disc itself (in the Blu-ray packaging) is just the film, with no digital copy and no DVD included in the package, it was still worth the purchase price to me.

A group of English retirees decide to relocate to a seniors hotel in Darpur, India, to live a relaxing life of leisure.  Unfortunately, the hotel turns out to be a dive -- rundown, dreary, and depressing.

The characters are a lot more colorful and interesting than the plot.  Tom Wilkinson plays gay magistrate Graham Dashwood, who has returned to India to find the boy he loved and left when he was young.  Bill Nighy is retired bureaucrat Douglas Ainslie with an irritating, constantly complaining wife (Penelope Wilton), whose savings have been lost by a daughter's careless investment.  Judi Dench is recent widow Evelyn Greenslade, who has never before looked after herself.  Maggie Smith is Muriel Donnelly, an unapologetic racist in need of a hip replacement.  And Celia Imrie is Madge Hardcastle, a gold digger still very much on the prowl.

The film attempts to tell too many stories simultaneously, which gives it an overstuffed feel.  But it's unusual to have a movie these days reliant on Golden Agers, and it's a pleasure watching these superb actors sinking their teeth into sometimes underwritten characters and enlivening them with years of experience.

Once the principal characters are assembled and disappointed by what they find, director John Madden provides their back stories.  There are many cliches and maybe too neat an ending, but the performances more than make up for the script's shortcomings.  Personally speaking, I would be happy to watch Maggie Smith peel an apple.  She is, at this point in her carrer, legendary and a master at her craft.

The sweet and easy-going husband who clearly deserves happiness but has stayed in the loveless marriage out of a sense of loyalty even though his wife consistently treats him with disdain - played with such tenderness and vulnerability by Bill Nighy.  The recently widowed woman who is taking a chance on herself and the possibilies which may be waiting - played to perfection by the amazing Dame Judi Dench.  And several more characters played with such depth and humanity by Dame Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, Dev Patel, Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup.

They are the first guests of this Indian entrepreneur Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel,) in a Hotel that has more character than convenience. Once in India and over the culture shock, our group start to adapt at different rates. Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) keeps an on-line blog about the events which adds some first person narration to the tale.

In India, the scenes switch back and forth to the various guests' activities which intersect at times, similar to many indie movie scripts. During this time we get to know the characters much deeper and see them change in a nation of contrast of old traditions and the modern era. The film touches on the caste system and prearranged marriages which are common themes in Bollywood films also.

The acting and script were top notch. The film contain the right amount of comedy, drama, and even romance to make for a delightful tale. Dev Patel, whose acting ability I thought was undeveloped in ""Slum Dog Millionaire"" takes it up a notch with this all-star cast. Kudos to Maggie Smith who managed to play a difficult character with perfection.

The movie is wonderful and a true delight, I loved everything about it. So much better then the crude trash they put out today and call it comedy! It was sad it had a limited release. It had depth, substance, a story line and good writing let alone acting by a fantastic cast!

Nothing exploded, no big effects, no harsh langauge every five seconds or crude bathroom or sex jokes, just a great movie like they USED To make.  If you love a well done film this is it!

The hotel, as often is the case when viewing something on the net, turns out to be not what is expected and actually far from it.  It is a story of contrasts from that point on. Some of the travelers embrace the sights, sounds, and adventures that lie ahead and some fight the differences from the start. Not done strictly for laughs though there are many hilarious moments, there are poignant scenes that resonate as well as scenes that exemplify how sensitive people can be at times and how blind they can be at others. What remains as this story unwinds is that strangers are strangers no longer and the people involved have a greater awareness and self-knowledge of themselves and others.
The casting in this movie is perfection. By far Maggie Smith and Judi Dench shine as two of the seniors as do Tom Wilkinson and the lesser known Bill Nigh. Dov Patel is great as the hotel's proprietor though the entire cast excels as an ensemble.
The scenery is beautiful and exciting and expresses a more laid back and sunny atmosphere in contrast to England.

The writing is superb, as is the acting. I did not know exactly how it was going to turn out, and that was its charm.
Dame Maggie and Dame Judi are wonderful, but Bill Nighy is the stand out for me.
Go to see it, you will not be disappointed. If you can see it on the big screen, the views of India are breathtaking. I felt it was like being in that mass of humanity that is India, and amazingly, it all worked.
The young owner of the hotel, Dev Patel, also is quite worth mentioning. He did a great job, and when he finally stands up for his girlfriend, well, that was a real 'moment'.

4884572,5,B005S9EJ14,"This movie, alas, did not come to my local theater. Apparently local taste does not run to British verbal humor and charm; around here, the market is for anything animated, films where humans are killed or dismembered and the understated subtlety of Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell comedies. Of course, the lack of an audience for Indo-British films might be because we have no Indians and only two British-born inhabitants (I am one of the Brits). I'm sure others living in rural areas have found the same. I eventually caught the movie on a long plane trip and was happy to while away the hours in the company of Maggie Smith, Judy Dench and co. As all travelers will know, planes aren't the ideal venue for movies, given the ambient noise, the person in the next seat wanting to use the restroom and the delivery of meals at the most crucial points in the plot, so I'm looking forward to seeing the DVD at home.

I did see and hear enough to know that this is a charming film. The British members of the cast, all well-seasoned veterans of many movies and TV series, play their parts convincingly and with relish, especially the inimitable Dame Maggie Smith. Such is the stock of mature British actors that a whole genre of film-making (Old Britcoms) would be possible and would find a ready audience among baby-boomers. However, the movie was raised out of the ordinary for me by a marvelous performance by Dev Patel, the young Indian actor, whose boundless energy, infectious enthusiasm and never-say-die attitude give the film a wonderfully uplifting mood.

I can't say this movie has caused me to want to move to Jaipur (even at Sonny's prices), although I am fast approaching the age when a move might be on the cards, but if he ever decides to open a sister hotel in this area, I'll be checking it out.

The setting and cinematography are compelling. And the message is uplifting. But, yes, it's also formulaic, unrealistic and predictable. The characters are stereotypical and the performances, especially Dev Patel's, are over-the-top at times. If you take it for what it is, a comedy with some funny one-liners that has some serious and even touching moments, you might actually enjoy this film.

All flaws aside, the likely reason this film didn't fare so well at the box office is exactly because it's about old people, which ""younger"" audiences do not find ""relatable"" (to use an irritating new term often invoked by the under 30 demographic). The film even pokes fun at this, noting that the hotel's success capitalizes on outsourcing to potential elderly clientele from countries like the US that don't like old people. Younger viewers who say they can't relate to the film because it ""isn't about them"" are missing the point. One day, provided they live long enough, it will be.

Maybe this film should come with a warning label that audiences must have an open mind and a certain level of maturity in order to enjoy this film on its own terms, regardless of whether or not it reflects back the viewer's own lived experience.",1341100800,4,1379,4.914163090128755

4884644,2,B005S9EJ14,"I watched ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in a theater full of senior citizens and, as we were exiting the theater, I heard approximately two of them saying that they had actually enjoyed the movie.  That's understandable.  While ""Marigold Hotel"" is, for all practical purposes,  a movie of, by and for senior citizens, its appeal may fall short of expectations.

The story is simple.  A group of English retirees answer the call to spend their golden years in affordable luxury at the titular hotel in India.  After flight cancellations force the group to catch a bus and tuk-tuks (three-wheeled auto rickshaws) to their destination, they are disappointed to find that the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a rundown mess, a ruin of its former glory (or perhaps not).  Many mishaps ensue as the Brits try and make the best of the situation and not run back to England with their collective tails between their legs.  The movie, a comedy-drama has tons of potential and should have been so much better, but director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin"") has fashioned an old fashioned movie with so little humor or drama that the movie is rendered lifeless.

The elite cast that Madden has assembled could perform the roles of these stereotypical characters in their sleep.  There's a recently widowed woman who has never done a thing on her own (Judi Dench); a browbeaten husband and his nagging scold of a wife (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton); a desperately flirtatious golddigger of a certain age (Celia Imrie); a gay judge suffering tremendous guilt over events in the past (Tom Wilkinson); a fun-loving tomcat ready to pounce on any woman who'll say yes (Ronald Pickup); and, of course, Maggie Smith as a sour-faced ex-housekeeper (as opposed to her usual role as a sour-faced aristocrat).  The situations the actors are thrown into are telegraphed far in advance, and there are absolutely no surprises.  We already surmise that one of the characters will not make it to the end of the movie, and it's an egregious irritant that director Madden reaches back to film mores of the fifties to ensure that it's the ""right"" character who dies.

Other than Celia Imrie, and a lovely turn by Diana Hardcastle (as randy Pickup's understanding conquest), I think the Indian actors come off best.  ""Slumdog Millionaire's"" Dev Patel is delightful as young Sonny, the inexperienced and cash-poor proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (which he inherited from his equally inexperienced and inept father).  Sonny's efforts to keep the hotel afloat and his genuine concern for his residents shine through in Patel's radiant performance.  Tena Desae, as Sonny's girlfriend, a call-center operator, also amuses and does her best to keep her character afloat in an overpopulated dead sea of clichs.

Ben Davis' cinematography wonderfully captures the many hues and the whirling dervish continuity of life, which makes this film all the more disappointing.  With all this life bursting at the seams, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" feels dead on arrival.",1339804800,18,3074,5.065476190476191

4884735,5,B005S9EJ14,"If you like British, you'll love this Exotic Motel flick. A large handful of giants in the UK acting world. All seem to play a character written just for them. That happens sometimes for one actor, but this time it's for many in one film. Perhaps it just seems that way because they are legendary contemporary actors, always at top performance, and make their characters seem so real. Either way, it's British Comedy/Drama perfection.

Begin with Dame Judi Dench (Cranford, Love in a Cold Climate, As Time Goes By) and Dame Maggie Smith (Downton Abbey, Harry Potter). Those 2 in one film almost guarantees 5 stars. Then add some more favorites like Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Pirates of the Caribbean), Ronald Pickup (Fortunes of War, Jennie), Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey, South Riding), and Celia Imrie (Bridget Jones, Titanic, Calendar Girls). To top off the cast, they are given a great dialogue script. It's fast-pace but keeping up with this set of old-timers is pure joy.
Deborah Moggach wrote the adapted novel, ""These Foolish Things."" She also wrote: Love in a Cold Climate, Diary of Anne Frank, To Have and To Hold, Pride & Prejudice, and more for TV &/or film.

Youth will give this a pass, but older adults will LOVE it. It's so right on for anyone old enough to look forward to retirement. But truth shows in the story, it's not always what is expected. Body or spirit or relationships. Some bonny dialogue lines are, ""We must celebrate the changes."" And ""It will be all right in the end and if it's not all right, it is not the end.""

Being 64 myself, I can say to younger viewers that this show demonstrates much of life's reality in mature years. And to critics of this film, there IS depth; every main character displays senior life to perfection.

It is so refreshing to see a film not about teenage angst but about adults at the end of their lives taking charge of the short time they have left and living each day to the fullest.  When I saw this film recently in the theatre, the median age of the viewer had to be at least 63 years of age. As I waited in line, practically everyone in front of me said, ""one senior for `Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'."" And the audience didn't talk, didn't send text messages or check their phones. They applauded at the end of the movie too.

The film, directed by John Madden, stars  Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson.  My apologies to the other cast members if they are well-known. I did not recognize them. I did learn later that the young Indian actor Dev Patel was in ""Slumdog Millionaire.""  The subtle soundtrack does not intrude. The acting to a person is quite wonderful with no one actor stealing the show, a good thing I think. There are wonderful lines that will make you laugh although some of them are a bit over used-- we know that old people say they do not purchase green bananas, for instance-- but if you are not careful you will find your eyes burning in a place or two. The movie is based on a novel by Deborah Moggach entitled THESE FOOLISH THINGS. She also wrote TULIP FEVER. One of the characters is seen reading this novel, a nice touch and endorsement for the author. Seven Brits of retirement age all converge on a hotel in India that they have seen on the internet, only to find that all that glitters is not gold. How many of us have had the same experience? Postage-stamp-sized photographs of exotic hotels in far-away places that we find on the internet seldom look like the quarters when we check in, often to a room that we can barely turn around in.

Such a fine message this film has: whatever you were planning to do, do it now. We will all be dead a very long time. A great little film that glows.",1338854400,2,2041,4.288311688311689

Then there's Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins, who hopes there's some life in the old boy yet, and Celia Imre as Madge Hardcastle, widowed housewife, who definitely thinks there's some life in the old girl yet, and hopes it's enough to land one last husband, hopefully a wealthy one.  According to IMDb, Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole were first cast as the latter two characters.  Imre and Pickup do fine jobs, but Christie and O'Toole are long time favorites of mine, and I can only imagine what the film might have been like with those two formerly-cast actors in the parts.  Oh well...

Aside from a few opening scenes presumably set in the U.K., most of the film seems to have been made on location in India, and it does a good job of giving us that country's flora, fauna, and social ways, its bustle and optimism.  However, it barely touches on the problems of that immense country; guess you can't expect a feel-good comedy to do that. Never mind, while Jean Ainslie reads&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tulip-Fever/dp/0385334923/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tulip Fever</a>, another novel by author Moggach now in development to film, her husband Douglas, and most of the other characters - and the viewers with them-- begin to explore the dynamic city in which they find themselves.

4884738,5,B005S9EJ14,"I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed this film starring some of the best of the United Kingdom's character actors. It has a well-told story, perfectly paced, with superb acting, much humor, and sentimentality. The theme is ""everything turns out well at the end, and if it doesn't it is not the end."" Seven old men and women who have lost virtually all of their money and who are searching for some meaning in their life respond to a misleading advertisement that a hotel in India will give them an inexpensive and enjoyable stay, for it is the ""best"" and it is ""exotic."" The seven find that they spent money they can ill-afford to spend for a run-down deteriorating hotel managed by a very likable but totally incompetent owner.

The seven are a woman whose husband mismanaged their funds who just died leaving her poor with nothing to do; a husband and wife who invested in their daughters business and lost everything, he has a good and respectful approach to people and events, she is bitchy and satisfied with nothing; a man who is gay who betrayed his lover when he was young, who had no satisfactory life afterwards, and wants to return to India and see him; a woman who is searching for a rich husband; a man who wants to regain his potency and have sex and an on-going relationship; and a woman who was once a housekeeper who was fired because she is old, who is prejudiced against anyone who is not British.

The young hotel owner is in love with a poor young woman. Neither his mother nor her brother wants the two to get married. His mother wants to close the hotel.",1338854400,4,1583,4.474048442906574
4884739,4,B005S9EJ14,"Seven British seniors leave the familiarity of their homeland to immigrate to India. Some are lured by the ads for 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', offering an oasis for elderly inhabitants. Some are lured by memories of their youth. Some make the journey due to necessity.

Written by Ol Parker and directed by John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"", ""The Debt""), ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" features seven of the finest British actors working today in an amusing, insightful and only occasionally, predictable look at how their lives are changed by their move to the exotic former colony.

Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) decides to make the move when her husband passes away leaving a mountain of debt. Her sons are trying to get her to move in with them, but Evelyn is too independent for that. Forced to sell the house and with little money, she spots an online ad for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and decides to move. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) can no longer stand the thought of living in England and leaves for the airport directly from his retirement party at the college where he teaches law. He is moving to India for an entirely different reason; as a young boy, his family lived in the area and he is looking up an old acquaintance. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) find they are now retired and have limited funds due to an ill-advised investment in their daughter's internet company. Rather than spend their golden years in a boxy flat designed for the elderly, complete with a panic button, Douglas convinces Jean that they should move to India. Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a bigoted old woman, finds she needs a hip replacement. Rather than spend six months or longer waiting for her name to come up on the National Health Service waiting list, she agrees to go to India for the surgery. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is a lech who finds his limited resources will go further in India as he tries to find an eligible, rich widower. Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) is basically the female equivalent of Norman, a woman who is using her limited resources to catch a rich widower. The British citizens meet at the airport and become traveling companions. Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel, ""Slumdog Millionaire"") greets his new guests with open arms. He is thrilled because they are his first guests and promise an income as he continues to prepare the hotel his deceased father bought for the guests. One day, he will be able to make it as nice as the brochure and website promise. He can now make his father's dream a reality, if only his older, more successful brothers and his mother would not interfere. The Brits find things are less than ready, less than hospitable. Some of them adapt and learn to enjoy their new lives. Some have more trouble.

When you have this many characters in a film, it is often difficult for any of them to appear real or human. Often, they have one or two traits, one or two quirks and this is all the filmmakers are able to give them, so they become cartoon characters. ""The Best Exotic..."" should be applauded because it is much more successful, giving more of the characters real complexity. But a few of the characters do fall short.

When your cast includes Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson, you would expect the film to be above the norm. And ""The Best Exotic..."" delivers. In fact, the characters played by these actors are the best of the bunch.

Penelope Wilton's Jean is a bit too shrewish throughout, giving her character the least interesting growth. Because of this, she also makes Douglas (Nighy) the most predictable. But they have a nice, somewhat unexpected, moment towards the end of the film.

Ronald Pickup's Norman and Celia Imrie's Madge are the most predictable and seem to be included for comic relief. Interestingly, I read that Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie were originally going to play these roles. I'm not sure why they dropped out. Strangely, I get the feeling Pickup and Imrie are playing these characters as written. What the actors are able to impart on the characters doesn't seem to come through as it does with the other actors. I can't exactly pinpoint why this is, but it feels like they don't bring anything of their own to the characters.

Dench is possibly the most complicated character. As Evelyn makes the journey, she states to more than one person she has never been outside of England and her two grown sons seem to regard this decision to move as a minor moment of indiscretion. When she arrives in India, you see moments of fear, excitement and understanding flash through her face at various times. But Evelyn's situation is such that she needs to get a job and this provides some nice moments, a nice circle of closure.

Dench is such a great actress and I am more used to watching her portray powerful, strong women. It is nice to watch her play a woman who is more down-to-earth, more vulnerable. Evelyn provides proof of Dench's range; Evelyn is strong - she would have to be to make this move and embrace it - but she is also vulnerable and open to all the new country has to offer.

Tom Wilkinson plays Graham, perhaps the most experienced of the group of travelers. Given he grew up in the country; the others turn to him for advice and guidance. Graham has spent the majority of his life living in a way that didn't make him happy. As soon as he retires, the very minute, he decides to leave for the country and look up an old acquaintance.

Because the other travelers depend on him, they look at him as an authority figure and more than one of the women seem to develop an attachment to him.

Maggie Smith plays Muriel, a former housekeeper who is now living the remainder of her life in a small flat with nothing to do. Deeply bigoted, she is torn between waiting six or more months for her surgery in London, or moving to India and having the surgery almost immediately. The pain wins over her fear of people with brown skin and she moves to a very scary place and seems to regard everything with great hostility.

It is a testament to the actress that she manages to bring the most complete character growth to her character; some key interactions lead her to begin to change, yet the changes seem natural and realistic.

Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton play Douglas and Jean. They are forced to move because they simply can't afford to live in England until their investment in their daughter's internet company comes through. If it ever does. Douglas seems more willing to live the adventure. Maybe resigned is a better word. Jean seems completely reluctant to give up the style of life she has become accustomed to in England. Through the course of the film, Jean and Douglas are perhaps the most predictable of the group. But both actors manage to make the characters interesting and mildly surprising in believable ways.

Dev Patel, so memorable in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and the BBC America series ""Skins"", is problematic. He runs around, waving his hands, talking in a thick Indian accent and he appears to be more similar to Apu, the animated character from ""The Simpsons"", than a real human being. He pines for a beautiful girl who works at a local telephone call center, but her brother doesn't approve of him. And his mother arrives just as he re-opens the hotel and tells him he has to close and return home and work for his more successful brothers. His romantic shenanigans are the main reason for this story and they appear too slapstick and comedic to make us really feel the romance.

John Madden has created a film that is uneven, providing characters that are predictable alongside other characters who are interesting and believable, in a story that manages to grasp our attention. The different characters are designed to move you, make you laugh, make you cry, make you feel the romance and love. Most of the time, these characters work.

It is definitely a film worth watching just for the performances of the majority of the leads.",1338249600,4,8017,4.691322901849218
4884740,5,B005S9EJ14,"The story focuses on a varied group British senior citizens who all find themselves feeling useless and wondering, ""Is there more to life?""  They each decide they need a complete change of pace and move to India to live in a fabulous retirement hotel, which, of course, turns out to be not at all fabulous.  They adjust to the very different Indian culture to varying degrees; some find what they were looking for, others not so much.

The outstanding ensemble cast is headed by Judi Dench as a recent widow who finds a job at a call center.  She's quite
likable and a pleasure to watch. Tom Wilkinson plays a man who was in love in India decades ago and hopes to reconnect. Maggie Smith is fun as an acerbic woman who goes to India for surgery even though she hates Indians and Bill Nighy plays a henpecked husband who longs for happiness.

I absolutely loved this movie; the characters were sympathetic and real and I cared about each of them.  Their storylines were believable and entertaining and I was left with a smile on my face. I think it would especially appeal to people of a certain age who may find themselves at loose ends. The movie will certainly make you examine your own life and perhaps convince you to try a very different, if initially frightening, path to fulfillment.",1338163200,,1290,4.562770562770563
4884741,4,B005S9EJ14,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a better film than one would expect, largely due to the talents of its truly stellar cast of actors who succeed in making the film as a whole more than the sum of its parts.  Or to be specific, more than its mediocre script.  Directed by John Madden, with a script by Ol Parker adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of those films that keeps you engaged by moving along at just the right pace, because if it didn't, you'd start thinking about its flaws rather than simply enjoying it for its deserved merits.

The plot begins in the UK where seven British individuals (actually five individuals and one married couple) facing their golden years are drawn for various reasons to ads for a retirement community in India, proclaiming itself as ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly & Beautiful.""  Evelyn (Judi Dench), recently widowed, finds herself facing retirement with little more than the pile of debts her husband left behind.  Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a high court judge well able to afford a comfortable retirement, is drawn back to India by memories of his youth which was spent there.  Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) Ainslie are also facing retirement with limited means due to Douglas having invested most of his life savings in his daughter's internet startup which is having trouble starting up.  Muriel (Maggie Smith) finds herself in need of a hip replacement which means several months of painful waiting unless she goes to India where she can have the procedure done immediately at a price she can afford.  Norman (Ronald Pickup), a retiree of limited means who fights facing old age by pursuing younger women, needs a change of scene.  Which also sums up Madge (Celia Imrie) who is looking for another husband - preferably a rich one - to keep her company and comfortable.  And so all of these diverse people suddenly find themselves thrown together, flying off to India and hoping for the best.

The best, however, seems to be rather elusive. First, they arrive in India only to find that their connecting flight to Jaipur has been canceled.  Undeterred, Graham, the only one of the group with any familiarity with India, quickly arranges for everyone to make the remaining leg of their journey by bus and tuk-tuk, little golfcart-sized transports that can barely carry more than one person and their luggage.  But when they finally reach their destination, the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful  turns out to be rather less than the brochures had promised.  The hotel, a grand but seriously run-down establishment where some of the rooms are missing doors and none of the phones work, clearly has seen better days, possibly around the time of the British Raj which also seems to be the last time it had paying guests.  Before the dismayed newcomers can get back into their tuk-tuks however, they are greeted by Sonny (Dev Patel), the manager and part-owner of the hotel, who overcomes their misgivings with his boundless always-see-the-positive enthusiasm, quickly getting them settled into their new quarters.

Each of the characters react to their new circumstances in different ways.  Evelyn is a little intimidated but also a little excited, this being the first time in her life that she's really done anything on her own. Which, it turns out, includes getting a job, which she desperately needs to be able to continue to stay at the hotel, ""even at Sonny's prices.""  Graham boldly sets out on some mission that involves looking up places he remembers from his youth - most of which are long gone now - and going to the district records office each day.  Douglas takes the hotels shortcomings in stride and treats their new life as an adventure, exploring the sights and culture with enjoyment, while Jean wants none of any of it, withdrawing into her room and into herself, refusing to make even the slightest effort to adapt. Muriel, a cantankerous and openly racist old woman, also makes no effort to adapt, refusing all of the of hotel's local dishes - ""If I can't pronounce it I'm certainly not going to eat it"" - living instead off of the stockpile of tinned foods she brought along, only gradually softening as she begins to empathize with the young Dalit woman (Seema Azmi) who attends her and cleans her room every day.  Madge joins the swank and exclusive Viceroy Club to start her search for a new and rich husband... only to find herself paired up with Norman who unbeknownst to her had done the same thing, still trying to cast himself as being richer and younger than he is.  In the meantime, Sonny is kept busy trying to keep his guests happy, trying to get a local businessman to invest money into the hotel so that he can fix it up properly, trying to keep his domineering mother (Lillette Dubey) from demanding that he quit this hotel foolishness and come back to Delhi to meet the girl she's arranged for him to marry, all the while trying to find time for his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), who works at a local call center run by her brother (Sid Makkar), which by coincidence is where Evelyn ends up getting a job as a cultural advisor to help their operators sound more natural on the phone.

The best part of the film is simply watching these veteran British actors inhabit their roles, making us feel their characters anxieties and hopes, their excitement at new experiences or their trepidation at the strange and unfamiliar. And in the way they each come to terms with their lives and with themselves. The performances are all first class and keep you fully engaged throughout the film, even when the plot developments strain credulity.

The weakest parts of the film, however, come from the script.  Most of the Indian characters are little more than cliches.  Though I haven't read the novel the film was adapted from - Moggach's These Foolish Things - it is apparent from the book's description that a number of changes were made for the screenplay.  Which is, I feel, where some of the problems stem from.  Moggach actually lived in Pakistan for a time.  Ol Parker's screenplay, however, seems to rely on stereotypes gleaned from Western movies set in India, which renders most of the Indian characters little more than clichs.  Dev Patel's Sonny is the ingratiating but comically incompetent hotel manager who in the end is rescued by one of the British guests stepping in to right things.  Sonny's mother is domineering, insisting that Sonny go through with an arranged marriage.  Sid Makkar's Jay is at least allowed to be competent and intelligent - and sympathetic - as the manager of the call center who ends up seeing Evelyn as having genuine value to his company. But when he's Sunaina's brother, he's a sterotype, the stern Indian male fending off Sonny's bumbling advances towards his sister. The one true exception is Tena Desae's vibrant Sunaina, almost ironically criticized in the film by Sonny's mother as being ""too modern"".  The contrast between Sonny and Sunaina is so sharp that you not only wonder what she sees in him, you wonder what they're doing in the same film. Desae has a natural screen presence that shines through the inadequacies of the script, making you want to see more of her in other films.

(Warning:  the next paragraph contains some spoilers.  Skip the next two paragraphs if you don't want to know.)

More troublesome is the way the script requires sudden and often inexplicable changes in the characters and their situations to meet the needs of the plot.  Douglas and Jean's financial situation is abruptly reversed, allowing Jean to flee back to England while Douglas decides to stay, both of them having realized that they're terribly unhappy together, which allows Douglas to follow his hope of a future with Evelyn. The ostensible reason for their reversal in fortune after only a matter of weeks is that their daughter's start-up company is suddenly swimming in cash for no apparent reason, other than the fact that the plot needed it to happen at that point. In truth it would only have taken a couple of lines of dialogue - one where the start-up is first mentioned and another to explain the miraculous reversal - to make it believable, but the scriptwriters didn't bother.  This was just sloppy and ham-handed.

In other instances, the hotel phones suddenly start working for no apparent reason, allowing Graham to find his long-lost lover and promptly die happy.  Sonny's mother, after having been reminded of Sonny's father's taking a stand for her by a servant who previously in the film has never said a thing, promptly drops her objections to Sonny marrying Sunaina.  And most bizarrely of all, Muriel not only suddenly becomes sympathetic, she comes to Sonny's rescue with a display of business acumen that one would expect of a former CFO rather than of a woman who'd spent her entire career as a housekeeper.

But for all the failures of the script to live up to its potential, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is still a film worth seeing, for the sterling performances of its extraordinary cast and for the way in which it deals, at least in part, with people having to face the realities of their lives and their circumstances and the choices they end up making as they rediscover themselves.  The spirit of the film is best summed up in this exchange towards the end between Evelyn and Muriel.

Evelyn:  ""Nothing here has worked out quite as I expected.""
Muriel: ""Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff.""

Definitely recommended.",1338163200,98,9602,4.816189896530736
4884742,4,B005S9EJ14,"Exotic locations and old-fashioned storytelling conventions are nothing revolutionary at the movies, but when executed with professionalism and an abundant heart, it can make for charming entertainment. This is exactly what happens under the reins of director John Madden (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shakespeare-in-Love/dp/B00001U0E1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shakespeare in Love</a>) with this whimsical 2012 dramedy that brings together a sterling cast of accomplished British veterans to play seniors who choose to ""outsource"" their retirement in India's colorfully mythical Rajasthan region. What they discover upon their arrival is a decrepit hotel run by an irrepressible young owner appropriately named Sonny. Optimistic to a buoyant extreme, he tries to gloss over the hotel's numerous shortcomings with a mix of responses from his rather addled guests, and their individual transitions into the local culture is what makes up their narrative adapted by screenwriter Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's 2004 novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/These-Foolish-Things/dp/0812982428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">These Foolish Things</a>.

The group of seven strangers who turn up on the steps of the Marigold Hotel is led by Evelyn, a recent widow who finds she has been saddled with her husband's seemingly insurmountable debts. Through her blog, she provides the film's central voice as she identifies her tentative steps toward not only assimilation into the Indian way of life but her own personal emancipation. Graham is a high-court judge who chooses early retirement in order to find the love of his youthful ardor when he lived in Jaipur as a boy. There's Muriel, an irascible spinster who is looking for a cheap hip replacement and plans to go back to England given her acute xenophobia. An unhappily married couple, Douglas and Jean, have come to the Marigold because they can't otherwise afford a retirement residence that meets her material needs. And then there are two singles both looking for mates in a new locale - saucy Madge who pretends to be Princess Margaret to gain entry into an exclusive club and incorrigible Norman who catches the eye of a lonely widow.

Sonny has his own issues as he faces stern maternal protest to his efforts to save the family hotel and marry the fetching girl he loves, an employee at a local call center. Needless to say, each character figures out what to do to work through their challenges as their lives change in the process. The cast is unsurprisingly excellent even though some of the characters are rather sketchily developed. Judi Dench lends her particular gravitas to Evelyn as she evolves from fearful to empowered due to her fulfilling job as a cultural instructor at the call center. Tom Wilkinson makes Graham's journey to India a genuinely poignant one with an unexpected denouement. Maggie Smith steals scenes easily as Muriel, although I have to admit I found her changed attitude the most incredulous to accept. Bill Nighy plays put-upon Douglas with charming vulnerability, while Penelope Wilton has the unenviable task of playing the shrewish, frightened Jean with conviction.

In roles originally slated for Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole (...how lovely it would have been to see such cinema icons in this film), Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup provide a nice blend of impudence and optimism to Madge and Norman. Bringing youthful vigor to their lives is Dev Patel in his first major role since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slumdog-Millionaire/dp/B001UEBHYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slumdog Millionaire</a>, and he brings a welcome comic ebullience to the proceedings as Sonny. Despite the creakiness of some of the plot devices, Madden keeps the pacing nimble enough so that no one character's arc dominates the tone of the film, which is crucial in reinforcing the message of hope he and Parker are conveying within the context of retirement and old age, that indeed life can get better with the proper attitude. Particular kudos need to be given to cinematographer Ben Davis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Debt/dp/B006INDMEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Debt</a>) who captures the teeming life and colorful splendor of Jaipur and Udaipur.

We elders can identify something of ourselves in every one of the major characters and can laugh, or nod our heads knowingly, or recognize one of our positive qualities. On the other hand, we can identify something in every one of the major characters that brings us up a bit short, with a small gasp of shock, regret, or embarrassment, perhaps, or the feeling that we must think that thing over carefully, examine it and ourselves, once we get home, and ask ourselves some probing questions. This is a movie, I predict, that will stay with most elders for at least several days after viewing. There aren't all that many movies like that these days, especially not for those of us with white hair, so don't miss this one.
