7891016,5,6305473358,"...this is a great surf flick to throw in the mix.  Everybody needs a good example of long boarding to round out the collection.
This film shows a lot of the evolution and plenty of modern style and longboard revival...",1394064000,,219,4.475
7891017,2,6305473358,"Ok. First things first, I was sold by the hype that this was the greatest thing on DVD since...well, since whatever.  But take a look at the cheesed-out cover.  You can't always judge a book by it's cover, but this one comes pretty close.
What you get is this.  You get a lot of hand-held videocamera type of filming.  It's decent, but it's got that totally home-movie look.  The comparisons to Endless Summer...totally unfounded.  No way, no how.
If you're looking for fantastic surf films on DVD, there are so many to choose from now.  Maybe all the praise for this came about as a result of this being one of the first dvd surf films around.  The makers of this movie where in the right time at the right place...and knew successful marketing.  Beyond that, it's just ordinary.  I had a copy and gave it away if that tells you anything.  As a surfer of more than 20 years, that's something I would have never seen myself doing.
In short, very amateur footage, very mediocre production.
Hope I haven't come off as too critical of this.  I support most anything that has to do with our beloved sport and its members, but this one just seems too hastily put together by the kids of the Audio-Video club of your local high school.
Enjoy kiddies",1054252800,2,1243,4.475555555555555
