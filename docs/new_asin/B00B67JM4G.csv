5559603,1,B00B67JM4G,"I've seen a ton of zombie flicks and I gotta say that this is the most gritty, violent zombie films I've seen. For the budget of approx 20k, the film is technically proficient in it's craft of story telling, yet there's something very unsettling about the treatment of the subjects. Frankly, it's closer to a snuff film than a zombie shoot-em-up and evokes a very dark view of society through the use of fear (of the living, not the dead). Over-indulgent violence, plunder and yes, rape, are not what drive zombie films, but the writer/director think otherwise. Further, children should never be exposed to this film due to the brutal treatment of it's characters.",1367452800,6,664,4.833333333333333
5559604,3,B00B67JM4G,"""Night Of The Living Dead: Resurrection""

Elements of George Romero's original 1968 ""Night Of The Living Dead"" are transposed into the English countryside and the modern-day world of smart phones and satellite TV, none of which comes in useful once the world ends. Overall, in the zombie-saturated, blood-soaked media landscape of today, this grim, low-budget film has modest offerings to add, dwelling on personal and social depravity... Perhaps the most terrifying is its portrayal of the vicious, nihilistic hooligans, British youth who are more mindless and violent than the zombies that surround them, more interested in filming the mayhem on their cell phones than in any viable survival strategy. It's a timely reflection of contemporary culture which may resonate on both sides of the Pond, but it's pretty depressing. Still, this isn't the greatest horror movie ever, and it rehashes many tropes we've seen before. Hardcore zombie devotees might want to check this out, though general audiences can probably skip it. Slow-moving, gory and unusually bleak, even for the zombie genre. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1367366400,8,1130,5.3841807909604515

Terrible story, bad acting, stupid characters.  This is just another movie that was made to try to rake in the dough by using the name Night of the Living Dead in the title.  Initially i was angered that there wasn't a blu ray release of this, then the 30th of April came around and i watched it on VOD. This angered me cause i wasted $5.99.

The Director apparently has no short term memory, as characters are repeatedly contradicting themselves from cut to cut
(Guy is bit in arm... he washes his hands, walks to living room, talks for 2 minutes, then exits to ""go wash up."")

Filled with random characters, we meet the main characters about 3/4 into the movie.... but then the last ten minutes introduces an entirely new cast and plot.  A ""twist"" is not the same thing as random.

The actors clearly had no idea what was expected of them, but that's okay, because I don't think we'd believe them.

over all, a waste of time, money, and effort for everyone.",1441756800,6,631,4.657657657657658

The eleventh entry adds nothing to the zombie mythology but is technically considered a remake of NotLD. Principal photography was completed in 12 days and manages to look and feel that way. It did break-even but only because it had a micro-budget ($20,000!!). It might not be a bad idea to take a few years off before releasing another NotLD movie. I loved Dawn of the Dead (and the remake) and hope to see more from the talented Romero (James Plumb actually directed this installment). NotLD and Day of the Dead are also legendary in zombie lore. Resurrection is the same low quality as House of the Dead (the arcade game was better). This did not get a Blu-ray release and isn't expected to anytime soon.

Scripture spouting, 125 year old grandpa is annoying. Little brother, that looks like he is a glue / aerosol  huffer, is annoying. Stop in the middle of the road instead of mowing through a pack of ""out past their bedtime"" brats, dad is annoying.
Ben driving... and driving... and driving... it seemed like he drove for 45 minutes of the film... sure he tries to get gas from a car stopped on the side of the road... and then 23 more minutes of Ben driving... AHHH! Ben was annoying!
I think this movie was filmed / edited to have the ever so popular retro ""grind house"" look... it was annoying... in fact, for the longest time I kept think some of the ""effect"" was just rain. And my biggest question is, are the teens of England so into ""A Clockwork Orange"" that they roam the rural English country side at night in hopes of  doing violence? Really? The dead are coming back to life and eating the living and the youth of rural Britannia are out in the dark, torturing and killing survivors???!!! The untamed, violent youth were annoying! This entire movie was annoying!
I spent over $12.00 for this movie and I am annoyed with myself cause I did not enjoy this movie one tiny bit! But anyhow...

Filmed in Wales, the movie depicts a family trapped in their home while ""crazies"" roam the countryside. Senseless dialogue and whipped up moments that ache for the next monotonously gory scene. The lure is the title that many fans of the genre won't be able to resist. The film had a few scenes going for it that made you think it might not be a waste after all for a low budget indie. Turns out those few well shot moments were all the film could muster up. If young directors are going to take on a classic in remembrance, do they have to go so far as to use the complete original title?  Prolonged camera shots of peoples heads while their thinking...repeatedly, reminds the viewer that the movie is just not artsy enough to sustain it.

Lack of special effects and limited cast can often be made up for with a well written script. Unfortunately ""Night of the Living Dead: Resurrection"" misses out on all counts.
This film starts off well enough with a bit of zombie action, and decent build up in the tension department. Things begin to go to Hell at about the 15 minute mark and rapidly degenerates from there. Character development and actions slides into the ludicrous. situations are played out in a way that make even the most forgiving viewer stand up screaming "" horse s***!""

5559626,2,B00B67JM4G,"This movie had good zombie effects and makeup but what this movie lack is a plot. The screenplay suck. There was no real storyline, the dialog suck and the actors were trying their best to deliver something but with lousy dialog written, it was close to impossible to deliver anything but a mediocre performance.

It seems that anybody that has the money to make a movie, tries to make a zombie movie just to make a buck. They think that we, the audience, are so stupid that we will support and promote anything with the name zombie attached to it. But, while they spend enough time worrying about the effects and makeup, they spent very little time working on the storyline.  The movie falls flat quite fast after, what seems to be, the main character is killed. A senseless dead of the black guy. That might it been some sort of funny reference to the fact that most movie like that always seems to kill that black guys early, but it wasn't . Believe me, that would have been. Too smart for this bunch.

5559628,1,B00B67JM4G,"****EARLY PLOT SPOILER**** (about 10 minutes into film)

The film opens like it is going to be a barn buster. It incorporates some Brit humor. Ben (Sule Rimi) is introduced. The film spends some time building his character. Indeed, he appears to know how to survive a zombie infestation. However, this film isn't about him, but rather a dysfunctional rural family with their own dirty little secrets. Grandpa is ill. On top of their problems, there are blue-eyed zombies and gangs of hoodlums that come late into the film.

I was bored for much of the film. The action was slow for too much of the film, and wasn't that great when it was happening. The actors were not convincing as they delivered poorly written lines.

They should have spent less time at the farm house and developed a decent subplot with the hoodlums, then bring them together. This would have been better than listening to Grandpa prate on about the end times.

5559629,2,B00B67JM4G,"The dead have risen from their graves once again with the need to feed on the living. As scientists speculate on the cause of this happening, theologists point to the Armageddon foretold in the Book of Revelation. As civilization crumbles, a family takes refuge from the living dead in an isolated farmhouse. The greatest threat, however, is already among them as they fight one another to stay alive.

I'm inclined to agree with the majority on this one. Don't get me wrong, I love zombie movies but this one comes across as a cheap cash-in on NotLD to make what cash it can. Heck, the acting is downright awful and the production values are pitiful. Not only that but the price for admission to this one is a twenty...and it isn't even worth a five-spot. Seriously. I've purchased better zombie films for a ten or less. Shame, shame, shame on these people who made this film. I'm greatly disappointed. It wouldn't be so bad if you did this film as an homage and stated it as such...but, to do otherwise is just tasteless. I even wonder if the director ever even viewed the original at all. This movie seemed more like a slasher/snuff film that it did a zombie film, to me. I see other reviewers have stated that as well.
