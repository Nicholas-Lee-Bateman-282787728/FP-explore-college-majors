4991399,4,B006ISGU0M,"Although at first glance it looks very easy, it is very challenging! Very nice, lots of flowing movements, but not enough cardio to my liking, and that's why only 4 stars. Other than that, it goes by really quickly, sometimes it takes a minute to catch up with the presented movements, but overall gets a nice sweat out of you. I especially liked the final part with VERY CHALLENGING triceps move, something which Ellen's previous DVDs sorely lacked.",1327363200,4,450,4.782051282051282
4991400,5,B006ISGU0M,"This is excellent.  Ellen is awesome and graceful.  I am so glad I chose this exercise to alternate with jogging and kick boxing.  I was sweating, but at the same time, I was lengthening and tightening my muscles.  I was feeling energized after this working.  The routine is easy but effective.",1327363200,2,294,4.686274509803922
4991401,5,B006ISGU0M,"I love this workout. It is fantastic, smooth and elegant. It doesn' t feel like anything is overdone, it works arms, and core, legs and butt. I know I need all the arm work I can get. It is something I think most women overlook. l have done almost all of Ellen's video workouts and this is the Best one yet. It is smooth and subtle, and with good cardio. Enough variety in moves to keep you alert and working, you won't get bored. I get bored when there is too many reps of one move, unless it is an ""oasis"". Her word. I think every workout needs little spots to catch your breath, thus oasis.  I have knee and back problems, so I frequently switch between all of her videos, depending on what I think my body needs.  Her workouts really work. I have lost weight, toned up, and I feel better. My knees don't hurt as much because she has helped me built up muscles to help support them( I used to run alot when I was younger), my back hurts less, because she works on the whole core, not just abs but the back for strength to offset ab work. I love the ballet aspect to all her workouts, I took ballet for many years and have found comfort in doing something familiar, and her videos also make you feel like you're with her in the Studio. I can't wait for the next one, it seems that each one gets better. Thanks Ellen.",1325289600,78,1318,4.14453125
4991442,5,B006ISGU0M,"I used to exercise all the time and since becoming sick, I needed something new to try. I have fibromyalgia so it's really hard to find the right exercise program that my body would allow me to do. So many programs are too fast and leave you dizzy with your head spinning but this one is slow and controlled. It might take some getting used to but it makes the body feel great (after hurting for days after your first try). It was really hard at first because my body is so weak but after the first 10 minutes, you'll realize you can do it until you reach the end, or be like me and can't do one of the moves that's like a crab position. It's really fun and it's been so long since I could do something like this (can't do it everyday I have my limits). So I would recommend it to anyone who's sick,healthy,bored or lazy to just get up and move.",1469232000,,845,4.096385542168675
4991443,4,B006ISGU0M,"Nice workout, strengthening and gives me a moderate cardio workout. No body shaming comments about fat blasting or the like. It is a little hard on my knees but I only do it once a week.",1463702400,,186,4.194444444444445

4991445,4,B006ISGU0M,Ms. Barrett's workouts are always balanced with burning fat and stretching. It's exercise that doesn't feel like exercise.,1457049600,,122,5.833333333333333

4991449,5,B006ISGU0M,"I love this DVD.  I only own one workout DVD and this is it.  I would get another Ellen Barrett product..... I think she describes this Grace & Gusto as a Pilates workout with just enough ballet thrown in to make you feel graceful.  And, not being an expert at either, I think it makes me feel graceful.  On a personal aside, I appreciate that she dresses modestly.",1437091200,,365,4.323529411764706
4991450,3,B006ISGU0M,"I really like Ellen's workout videos, but I was really disappointed in this one.

1. It's 45 minutes, which is longer than her other videos. That would be fine if all 45 minutes were necessary, but...
2. This one is really, really boring. It's very repetitive, and I don't feel like the poses and moves give a varied and challenging range of motion.
3. This one is also really annoying. It grates my nerves. She talks the whole time (the WHOLE time) (THE WHOLE TIME), and the music is just ridiculous in some places.

I'm going to donate it to the local library.",1435795200,3,562,4.446601941747573

4991466,5,B006ISGU0M,I have been buying all of the videos in this series and love them all for the most part. They are all similar but the routines are different enough that you can rotate them during the week. I thinks she's a great instructor and I find her  very inspiring.,1420416000,,255,4.204081632653061

At the end I felt like I had gotten a good workout. It's cardio and toning in one. Some of the moves were inspired by ballet and Pilates.",1409443200,,285,4.296296296296297
4991494,4,B006ISGU0M,"I used to watch Ellen a long time ago...still love her....this video moves somewhat fast, so you may have to replay a couple of times to get all the steps.",1407110400,,155,4.2

4991496,5,B006ISGU0M,"I love Ellen Barrett & cycle her DVDs on the days I just can't stand to look at Jillian Michaels again lol if you are looking for a high impact/intensity workout this is not for you. I love this workout because it brings me back to my ballet roots & I feel energized when I'm done. The stretching feels so good after your higher intensity days. Ellen is a great instructor & her cues are excellent. This is slower paced but there is a lot of balance challenge which is great for the core. Pair this with higher intensity workouts & you will see your waist become defined, hips slim down & overall better core strength.",1405382400,,618,4.336206896551724

4991499,3,B006ISGU0M,"As I exercise at 6am,I really like her soft approach. A good program with the rah rah approach. I own3 of her works.
  Best of all with choreography & blend of different types of movement schools is her Fusion DVD",1402358400,,213,4.3
4991500,5,B006ISGU0M,"I agree with all the comments above. This is a wonderful workout and despite it being so smooth and graceful, you actually get a great workout and you feel so much better and invigorated afterwards. It is very easy on knees and back and offers modifications. Also the fact that she goes through the workout without breaks or film cuts makes the whole experience even more real and you feel like you are actually in her studio! Great for a home-workout on a rainy day!",1398556800,,467,4.5058823529411764
4991501,5,B006ISGU0M,"This video is Barrett's best! The cues are perfect, the pacing is even and it hasn't gotten boring yet. Her videos make nice additions to the workout calendar.",1398211200,,159,4.714285714285714

4991513,5,B006ISGU0M,"Received this 45minute DVD last week, one word: AWESOME! This is a feel good cardio sculpt with NO mental gymnastics. There's something about her workout style ballet+pilates+yoga [cardio+strength+stretch] that kinda makes you feel sexy when you're working out....45mins flies by...I prefer the 30min workouts but I had to take one for the team and try the 45min since the 30min were so energizing and fun! I've been working out with Ellen Barrett for 13yrs now and she has the best workouts I've ever done especially this new barefoot fusion fitness series. I also have the 30min Super Fast body blast and the 30min sleek & sculpt.",1397088000,2,632,4.971698113207547
4991514,4,B006ISGU0M,I love Ellen's videos and really look forward to doing them.  I was tired of the complicated dance moves and loud music of other classes.  Grace and Gusto is fun but challenging workout with easy steps to follow. You do it barefoot!  I love Ellen's mind and body approach and find that I'm stronger and I'm even standing a little taller.  You will be sore though the next day...so make sure you stretch extra afterwards.,1393891200,,420,4.56
4991515,3,B006ISGU0M,"I love Ellen's DVDs, this one is not my fav. Don't love the moves in this DVD. I prefer Sleep Sculpt and Fat Burning Fusion.",1393718400,,124,4.0
4991516,5,B006ISGU0M,"There's something about her that really is refreshing; as a teacher, I really appreciate her clear, concise instruction, delivered in a cheerful, non-artificial way, with an apparently genuine love of her craft.  She's good, and she's fun...and each of the DVD's I've bought of hers have been a pleasure to work out to.

This one is, as well.  You end up feeling refreshed and revitalized as well as relaxed, if that makes any sense.",1392163200,,433,4.824324324324325
4991517,1,B006ISGU0M,"I fell for all the positive reviews and decided to cave.  I typically do advanced workouts and I knew this workout wasn't of that caliber, but I was hoping for moderate workout that I could do on those low energy days.  I have never done a Ellen Barrett workout so I thought a new change of pace would be nice.  This was a complete waste of time for me.  I really wanted to stop this workout less than 15 minutes into it.  The music was dull, the moves were generic, and it just wasn't much of a workout at all.  There are much much better workouts to choose from on a low energy day.......take a pass on this one.  This DVD will never see the inside of my player again.",1390089600,2,670,4.107692307692307
4991518,5,B006ISGU0M,Love most everything Ellen Barrett. This is a great workout that combines her pilates moves with more traditional cardio moves.,1389830400,2,127,5.4
4991519,4,B006ISGU0M,"Good exercises, worked entire body.  Ellen Barrett is engaging and motivating.  I haven't exercised in years and am overweight.  Many of the exercises are to hard for me to do right now, but for someone who exercises on a moderate basis this would be a great DVD.",1389484800,,263,4.553191489361702
4991520,5,B006ISGU0M,This video is easy to do but still provides a great workout.  I am a huge fan of getting that feeling that you worked hard but still are able to move around the next day.  If the exercises are too hard you'll eventually give up on it.  This one tones and lengthens.  Plus Ellen Barrett doesn't make annoying comments or have a voice like nails on a chalkboard so you don't have to hit the mute while exercising.  Would highly recommend this dvd.,1388102400,2,445,4.313253012048193
4991521,5,B006ISGU0M,I enjoy doing this workout and look forward to it every night. It is a very soothing and calming routine- but you feel the burn when you're done with it. I am definitely at a beginner level- so I don't know if it would be much of a challenge for someone with advanced fitness- but I find it to be the perfect exercise after a long day at work.,1387238400,2,343,3.9855072463768115
4991532,4,B006ISGU0M,"I like this workout, but it is what I do when I am tired or sore. It is short (45 minutes) and flies by. Basically I will do this when I don't feel like working out. I get a little sweaty and it works your full body but no part gets worked very hard. It is light intermediate. The instructor is pleasant and not too obnoxious. She does repeatedly work ""Grace and Gusto"" verbiage into her instruction, which gets a little tedious. Her instructions are clear and you move quickly from one exercise to the next. It is a lot of squatting and standing pilates-type moves. Overall enjoyable.",1386979200,,585,4.425925925925926
4991533,2,B006ISGU0M,"I love most of her videos but I have plantars fasciitis and the ""pony"" move was just too much for my feet. I HIGHLY reccomend her Fat Burning Fusion video which is a GREAT workout with much better music. Even if this one didn't bother my feet, i would still be bored with it.",1386892800,2,275,4.111111111111111
4991534,3,B006ISGU0M,"Maybe this kind of workout isn't my thing. It's not terrible, just not that interesting (and not fast enough to burn many calories). It's a slower pace, so if you need that kind of workout you might like it. I used it just once, and I haven't used it again. For me, it was a waste of money. She was a good instructor, the workout seemed useful. Maybe just not my thing (I prefer circuits and cardio, maybe I just can't slow down....?).",1386460800,,435,4.253012048192771
4991535,5,B006ISGU0M,"I love it when Ellen reminds us to ""use your body, it's your body."" She has great wit and warmth, seems like someone I'd love to have coffee with. I also like the live format with the other exercises who also seem like ""real"" people.",1385510400,,233,4.2
4991536,4,B006ISGU0M,"I love Ellen Barrett!  She has helped to give me a better body in my forties than I ever had in my twenties!  This isn't the favorite of my workouts that she leads, but I add it every once in a while for the variety.",1385164800,,216,3.7777777777777777
4991537,3,B006ISGU0M,"I have been doing this workout for 3 weeks (6 days a week). I find it to be a little boring and repetitive at times. It is surprisingly challenging though. What seems like an easier workout leaves me with lots of gratifying aches and pains the next day. I have not noticed a real change in my body yet, things may be firming up a tiny bit... but no weight loss. I do really like Ellen as an instructor. I am going to try her 30 minute video because I am finding that most days I just don't have time for 45 minutes. Overall it's just okay. I don't love doing this workout. I used to do the Insanity workouts and LOVED those, but needed something a little more gentle for my current health condition. This fits the bill, but isn't ""perfect"" for me.",1383782400,,747,4.194444444444445
4991538,5,B006ISGU0M,"A great workout for Pilates fans. Instead of mat work, you are standing for all the exercises and using your core muscles to balance for 40 mins. The extra 5 min floor workout is another boost that helps firm your core and arms.  Very happy with this dvd.  Ellen is a great instructor and provides a easy to follow workout.  Not for those wanting to sweat it out though, its more aimed at balance and core work.",1383696000,,411,4.311688311688312
4991539,5,B006ISGU0M,Ellen Barrett is the best workout instructor! I have several of her dvds and Grace & Gusto is one of the best. You must use your core to keep your balance for many of the exercises so you get a total body workout. This workout is gentle but effective and makes me sweat!  Thanks Ellen!!!!!!,1380153600,,290,4.2727272727272725
4991540,5,B006ISGU0M,Really is the best Ellen DVD! I love the pace and tone of her workout and enjoy her movements. Nothing too new if you know her other DVDs but the best one yet!,1379635200,,159,3.8484848484848486

4991544,5,B006ISGU0M,"I love all of Ellen Barrett's DVD.  I am not an athletic person and have bad knees.  I am not overweight, but I want to exercise daily.  Most workout I've tried are either too hard, or don't have enough cardio.  What I love about these is that they are not too fast or too hard, they really are made for a ""normal"" person like me who never did ballet or dance and may not be superfit; however, the workout are fun, challenging, and increase body function.

For the past year I have tried to increase the functionality of my body by working one on one with physical therapists to address various common issues that I have such as weak glutes, lack of hip stability, or shoulder tension from a sedentary lifestyle.  I love how her workout integrate a lot of the exercises and stretches you do in physical therapy, except its much more fun because the workouts have a flow.  I think she is very creative and innovative in having found a way to incorporate functional training, cardio, strength and flexibility and unlike many other videos out there, you can safely do this regularly without hurting yourself.

I will definitely get and use all of her dvds!",1376611200,19,1153,4.536231884057971
4991545,5,B006ISGU0M,"This is the best exercise video I've done, really.  Ellen is very easy to listen to...great personality and she talks you through the moves very well.  It's not super high impact, so good for people that want a workout that is easier on the body.  It is a cardio workout but you don't really notice as everything is done somewhat slowly. With this video, as well as dietary changes, I was able to lose 28 lbs. in a few months time.  I recommend it for people like me....Ones that aren't super coordinated and have a hard time with other exercise videos in the past...No weird body contortions, just a very, very good straightfoward workout that changes your body!!",1376006400,13,664,4.601694915254237
4991546,5,B006ISGU0M,"I love this workout.  As a 55 year old woman, I have done my share of high impact workouts.  Now, I want something that is a little easier on my joints.  This workout is perfect.  It is 45 minutes of a fairly consistent level exertion.  The title comes from the graceful, ballet-type steps and from the gusto portions which have slightly faster movements.  She uses a broad range of movements that work your entire body.  Has a nice workout for the arms with arm circles which are sprinkled throughout the work out and some triceps push ups at the end.  This is a workout that I can look forward too even after a long day of work.",1374451200,,630,4.3247863247863245

4991548,5,B006ISGU0M,Ellen Barrett has a way of taking you through a workout without you realizing that you have just exercised every muscle in your body....but you'll know it the next day! Very low impact - lots of balance challenges - and a very fluid routine. Just what a balance challenged older woman needs! I now have 5 DVD's by Ellen and I love them all.,1374192000,,340,4.328125
4991549,5,B006ISGU0M,This workout is a bit deceiving. Seems pretty laid back at first then you realize you are really working!  Good overall body work and stretch. Ellen just does a great job.,1373932800,,171,4.516129032258065
4991550,5,B006ISGU0M,"This video is exactly as billed.  Easy to ""break into"" the exercise routine & I can just stop when I've reached my limit.

Thank you.",1373846400,,313,4.15

4991552,5,B006ISGU0M,"Love this instructor. Her enthusiasm and style are compatible with my needs. I like her studio and her group of ladies are authentic - people I'd feel comfortable working out with! Now, can I find an instructor like this in my area?",1371859200,,232,4.5476190476190474
4991553,3,B006ISGU0M,"I love Ellen Barrett but this one isn't my favorite.  She uses entirely new verbal cues which seems unnecessary as the old cues are the same ones used in all yoga and pilates workouts and there are a couple of exercises that require knee stability which I don't have due to an ACL injury.  I still do it but I much prefer other workouts of hers.  Still worth the purchase just for the variety, though.",1371513600,,401,4.32
4991554,5,B006ISGU0M,"Simply put....This is the first workout I EVER truly looked forward to doing.  Here's what.  I got an unexpected high auto repair bill, and instead of craving potato chips from the stress of it....I craved getting home and doing this workout. I never did a workout that had such a dual effect. It does as much for your mind as your body and I've done yoga and pilates...and I have stiff knees. Has helped all over. Lots of squats, and arm, leg,side stretching. Your body just drinks it in. If it's too easy to you, you aren't focusing enough (or three cheers for you) and if it's too hard, do less reps and only squat to your comfort level.  It could use a little more of a cool down, but I just use another routine for that. I think Ellen is The Bomb!!!!",1371168000,,755,4.265734265734266

The pace is not difficult, her instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  She is a lovely and pleasant instructor.  I didn't give it five stars as I don't feel the gusto part is very aerobic.

I did step aerobics for years, but I just can't do anything with high impact anymore. This workout is a combination of yoga and pilates moves. I love Ellen, she is real and upbeat, and the moves are so gentle and interesting that you don't realize you've had a great workout until the end. Easy on the  joints but you get a real buzz.",1362268800,,473,4.375

She really does know her stuff and knows how to think ""outside the box"" of the conventional stuff for real results.  I have a few of her DVDs and love them. I saw Grace & Gusto in the On Demand section of my cable provider & had to try it.  I LOVE IT.  You get a great upper, lower, and mid body workout, for 360 degrees around the body.  And there is so little impact you don't even need shoes.  She has arranged the moves so that the workout seems to fly by.  Her movements are so controlled and smooth that you are always using muscle, not momentum.  So even with her workouts that don't use weights, you get a toning and tightening effect as well as good cardio.  I will definitely be adding Grace & Gusto to my collection!  I've done this one for the last two days and I can really feel it, especially in the obliques and triceps.  You get a head-to-toe workout without feeling beat up.  I can't wait to do it again tomorrow!",1361836800,2,1029,4.2153846153846155

Those that like harder more advanced workouts than what Ellen gives this is a great workout for you to get some of those graceful moves in.  I wouldn't call it advanced but is great to get those ballet inspired moves in that give you that long lean look.  This workout is great for beginners my 8 year old daughter was doing this one with me! LOL  There are so many beautiful ballet movements in this workout and thats what I love about this workout.

This is my second of Ellen Barretts workout videos and I have done the 2 she used to have on Fit TV.  I like them.  My favorite of the 4 is actually her ""Skinny Sculpt"" DVD.  I have spent a lifetime working out spinning, and stepping and lifting really heavy wieghts in barbell classes.  I've also recently done quite a bit of Zumba.  I am actually finding that I'm getting more results with this because it is so different than other things I've done my whole life.  Plus, I am a bigger gal that tends to bulk up even though several experts say that shouldn't happen.

Grace and Gusto is my new training method.  I was sore after the first time and each time after that. A good sore. My arms are looking good again.

I have tried many videos over the years, and hers are by far the best.  I feel so good while doing them, and then afterwards I feel great too.  Although they are not high impact (which my body is very thankful for) I still get my heartrate up and I work up a sweat.  Her combination of yoga, pilates, and ballet is perfect.  I also love that I can workout without wearing shoes and socks.

Ellen really is a fabulous teacher.  Her cueing is excellent. I am not a dancer and I don't have rhythm, but I am able to follow her dvds without a problem.

This DVD delivered everything I hoped it would. As someone with back and foot problems, it was nice to have something that was low impact, but still very energetic. I feel like I get a comprehensive workout and it makes me sweat. The best thing for me, though, is that my back problems mean I have balance problems and this video offers a lot of balance exercises. While I still struggle with them, I can tell they are making a distinct difference in just one month and are a huge help in getting stronger.

I found this workout a little bit humbling in that I had to drop my arms a few times, i was stunned at how much they were being worked by what looked like an easy to do tape, led by a great instructor. This DVD works, although I did fall over a few times during moving tree pose...there's that non-graceful part. It is indeed something to work towards, and far more challenging than it looks. I read somewhere that mind body fitness is the new way to go, and Ellen Barrett has been considered one of, if not the best, instructors in this field, she'll get no argument from me...sore arms and all. Guys, try this with an open mind, you might be in for a shock...I was, happily so..this workout works everything, mostly I felt it in my mood, my productivity level at work, and my overall out look on life!!

This is a really good work out. The moves are basic and easy to master....even the choreographically challenged among us had no problem keeping up with the routine. No weights and yet you can expect your arms to get an awesome workout. No special props....just a mat. The intensity is low enough that shoes are unnecessary. We worked up a sweat without stressing our knees and backs. Ellen doesn't do a lot of mat work on this dvd, but that's OK.

8498832,4,B006ISGU0M,"There's a lot to like in this routine: it is full-body, it is companionable (the ever-radiant Ellen and her bevy of exercise beauties), and it is intelligent (the moves make sense) -- except for one thing: the arm twists. They appear in other Barrett productions but they are especially featured in this one, and for the life of me, I can't see why. Unless you have the arm strength of a dragonfly, I don't know what this exercise can possibly do for you. I always find myself doing other things that at least give my arms SOME sort of challenge. And then there is the more generic critique I have -- which applies to nearly all Barrett's workouts -- and that is the unnecessary pauses. The pauses have the group -- and you -- literally standing still while she talks about the next move, or hesitates before leading into it. I find them baffling: why are we standing still? Why are we stopping instead of moving directly into the next move? Another weakness, I think, is in taking the moves too slowly to begin with, before moving at a reasonable tempo (I am usually ahead of the group in the video because I don't like holding myself back). Then there are the moments when Ellen breaks the momentum of the workout with deliberate slowdowns -- I don't even mean her 'oases', which might be welcome -- but that's not a problem in this video. All the same, you have to be prepared, if you feel the wind is at your back, so to speak, to carry on with a more driving movement when Ellen and the girls stick to a stodgier beat.",1483056000,2,1523,4.404255319148936

I rotate through a couple of her dvds every week to help my balance, posture, burn calories and tighten up every muscle in my body.  Ellen Barrett teaches to focus on breath during exercise among many other mandatory exercise techniques.  This idea of deep breathing during exercise has flooded into other areas of my life helping me to cope with stressful situations.

I personally would caution anyone who works out daily to make sure that they rotate body parts and Ellen Barrett dvds - meaning if you do Grace and Gusto which works the arms and shoulders a lot- the next day do an exercise that concentrates more on legs like her Power Fusion dvd - then take a day for simple walking and stretching or a day off and start the dvd rotation again.

I come from a family of professional athletes and I am 52.  I have had 10 major spinal surgeries and Ellen Barrett's exercise methodology has improved my quality of life immensely.",1480809600,5,1034,4.622950819672131
