697136,5,630363270X,"Literally one of the funniest films ever made, if you like your humor warped and subversive.  Frogs hooked on smack and the rat drug dealers who sell to them, a sex-crazed lovestruck hippo, a fly reporter who gives new  meaning to the words ""taboid journalism"", the strangest musical  number ever filmed, and the most riotous use of the word  ""Yippee!"" I've ever seen.  This is not for all tastes.  If you  have no problem with any of the above, you will literally laugh until you  cry.  Easily offended people should probably steer clear.  Seeing as  director Peter Jackson's next project is a live-action version of ""The  Lord of the Rings,"" it is difficult to assess if the man is a genius  or insane.

697392,2,630363270X,"I usually like to leave detailed, sophisticated reviews, but...not this time. This movie is SUCH a mind-screw, all I can really do is name the things I enjoyed, and the things I hated.

GOOD POINTS:

* A surreal, nightmarish, uncanny-valley-ish atmosphere, for those partial to such things

* Some likable characters, including two kind-of leads (Robert and Lucile) who can compensate for the other, not-so-likable protagonist, Heidi (more on her later)

* One of  the best Peter Lorre parodies I've seen yet (Trevor the rat is much closer to the 3-dimensional, sinister villains Lorre played on the silver screen, than most Peter Lorre spoofs you see in cartoons)

* A rare couple of scenes where ""offensive"" humor is actually done well: the Sodomy Song, and the turtle's Vietnam flashbacks. These scenes were ""bad"" (naughty/politically incorrect) without being gag-inductively gross.

* Some truly classic lines, that made me laugh out loud. I'm almost reluctant to say them here, for fear of ruining them for anyone. But... ""You may be Robert to your friends, but you're fly s*** to me!""

BAD POINTS

* Way too many disguising, stomach-churning, vomit-inducing scenes, that take ""gross out humor"" to new levels

* Most of the puppets are creepy beyond all reason, and it took me three or four tries to watch most of the movie because of that. This is Uncanny Valley at its finest.

* An unlikable protagonist. Yeah, this is probably blasphemy; everyone else who leaves reviews or comments seems to feel so sorry for Heidi the Hippo, and the movie certainly wants you to. But honestly, I just found her disgusting and annoying. I do not blame the walrus for cheating on her. I wish the film had ended with her dying.

And that's basically all I have to say about ""Meet the Feebles.""",1413417600,2,1784,4.870860927152318

697455,2,630363270X,"This movie is great, I would rate it about 4 to 4.5 stars. This review, at two stars, is about the DVD release from ""Substance"".

The DVD is 4:3 full screen, cropping the movie's original aspect ratio of 1.78:1. There are no extras on this DVD, barely even a menu. The video looks like it has been taken from a second-generation VHS tape. The colors are bleeding and are overly saturated. Everything looks mushy.

I'm not sure why they did not do this right. The very next DVD in their lineup, Peter Jackson's ""Bad Taste"", looks great. It has a crisp 1.66:1 aspect ratio image in an anamorphic frame, and it contains a 25 minute making-of featurette. Why could they not give this Peter Jackson movie the same treatment?",1262995200,8,719,4.565891472868217

Although, it is pretty gross at parts, you can't help but laugh at the absurdness of these puppets doing the things they do! Can't believe the same guy ( Peter Jackson) who won awards for Lord Of the Rings came up with this stuff! lol We previously ordered this through Overman2000 and never recieved it, had to reorder through Amazon and we recieved it promptly... The box was broken in one spot and although it was supposed to be New the DVD was scratched pretty bad, it had come off the clip and was loose in it's box.... still worked thank goodness with no problems and Amazon gave us a discount on our next purchase and quickly responded to my emails.

697457,5,630363270X,"Meet the Feebles! Ah, where to begin. Let's start with I have never laughed as hard as ever when I popped this movie in. This film made me laugh my head off completely! First of all, puppets having sex! You can't get any better than that. Furthermore, they swear, they smoke, they murder with blood galore, and I can just go on and on from there. Peter Jackson is by far my favorite filmmaker of all time mainly because of Lord of the Rings. When I checked out his earlier movies, they made me like the guy even more. Not only can he do a great adventure epic, he can also do eye-popping splatter gore flicks like Bad Taste, Dead Alive, and this one. Of course I like all of his movies and this one is probably the most underrated of them all. The DVD by the way needs a huge makeover, by Anchor Bay preferably. Widescreen would be nice too with a better, grainless picture, with some decent extras as well. With a conclusion, Meet the Feebles is one gross-out comedy which will rock your funny bone to the core. Hell I loved it and you will too. I guess I will end with: Trevor, I want that fudgepacker eliminated!",1222819200,,1115,4.289099526066351
697458,3,630363270X,"Of all the films Peter Jackson made in his early ""wacky B-movie"" period, this one is almost certainly the least accessible. The subject matter is very adult, the music is overpoweringly loud and obnoxious, the camera work is claustrophobic, and Jackson appears to be trying to make you throw up as often as possible. The end result of all this feels something like a movie equivalent to finger nails on a chalkboard. Still, it has it's moments, and if you're looking for something different and/or have always wondered what the Muppets would be like it they were NC-17, then look no further.",1216684800,3,591,4.803921568627451
697459,4,630363270X,"When I first reviewed this movie, I gave it one star, basically panning because of how it did not shock me that much.  Well, I certainly was never shocked, but I didn't need to.  It's a very fun, funny, absurd movie, and it's when I started wanting to watch the movie over and over again.  Well, I was sure wrong.  Oh sure, I still don't find this anywhere edgy, but I think that going for the Muppets-style was wise, as if this was live action, it wouldn't be able to receive an R rating in a million years.  It would just be a boring porno film and it wouldn't be funny or charming.

First off, the storyline in it is what makes it so entertaining.  Certainly, while warping the Muppets really isn't very edgy in my opinion, it just makes the whole thing more enjoyable to watch, giving it a cartoonish feel, which makes it just more fun to watch, giving it a sense of comic black humor, something live action would be hard to replicate.  Furthermore, I find the sets to be gritty and basement like, which of course is awesome.  I love the more realistic feel of it, which makes the movie all the better, more gritty.

Forget the fact these characters are animals, they are very memorable and crooked as it is.  You've got the porn disher, the drug addict, the drug dealer, a rabbit with AIDS, a hippo that is fragile, a cool whale like thing that eats a flyand a chicken involved in a paternity suite.  I alos like the ending, which features the death of most of the characters expect the ones with not many vices, which seems realstic because they have no vices, and would have the guts to save themselves.  It's great that you know what happens to the survivors, which live happily but live a life that is suiting and realistic.  The songs are hilarious, catchy and very memorable, as well.

One other thing remarkable about this movie is, I think the puppets and the cartoonish world of it adds a distinctive style.  Sesame Street itself wouldn't be the same without it's style of puppets and sets, and Meet the Feebles indulges in that.  I'm press to say that this movie feels like nothing else out there, which makes it all the better.

Sure, it's not quite a masterpiece, but this overlooked film from Peter Jackson is very funny, and definitely worth watching more than once.  I can't think of a movie that is more underrated than this.  A cult classic if there ever was one.

697460,5,630363270X,"If you think LOTR was Peter Jackson's best work, you might wanna consider changing your mind. Yeah, Peter Jackson has made some epics, but cut back to before LOTR. There was ""Bad Taste"", ""Meet The Feebles"", and ""Dead Alive"". And Meet The Feebles? Definitely the best Peter Jackson movie!

The movie is all puppets, no humans. In this movie, the feebles have a show called ""Feebles Vareity Hour"", a show where The Feebles showcase their talents. The star of the show is Heidi The Hippo, an ultra talented singer. However, backstage, her husband the Walrus has been cheating on her. Meanwhile, the frog is having trouble throwing knives properly, and not only that, but has a bad heroin problem. All the animals have problems, especially Bletch, who is in trouble with the underground Heroin traffic. Everything goes wrong, and the Feebles can't get their act together!

He buys the heroine from the rates (remember, they were always trying to take over the Muppet Show), who, aside from dealing drugs, shoots porno films in the basement of the theater.  Films like Anal Antics, etc.

The boss is a drug dealing two-timing walrus who is banging the show's next star when the Miss Piggy character stumbles in.

There are inter-species love scenes (poodle and rat, walrus and cat, walrus and hippo, chicken and elephant, etc.  And a lovable hero come to the show to practice his craft and overcome his shyness.

When I first saw Meet the Feebles (NOTE: the Spectrum Entertainment/Dead Alive Productions Region 1 DVD edition) I didn't understand half of what was being said by the characters due to the poorly recorded sound, lack of subtitles, and background music being too loud. But something made me come back and watch it again. Maybe it was the amusing dialogue, earthy puppets, and (deceptively) cheap production values - all set against the backstage drama of a variety show. Obviously, a lot went into the making of MTF. Peter Jackson isn't so in love with his work that he lingers on shots too long -which is the pitfall of many filmmakers, amateur or not. Unlike many DIY movies the editing here is swift which keeps the ball rolling. And it only gets better with repeated viewings. You can see that he totally was going for something.

697609,5,630363270X,"This ranks with ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" as two of the best movie musicals ever made.

I've always said to anyone who would listen that this is, in my opinion, Peter Jackson's magnum opus.  And I'm talking about the REAL Peter Jackson, not the hired gun (wisely) brought in to juice up LOTR, which it badly needed after Terry Gilliam got detached.  LOTR is exemplary fantasy, to be sure.  But ""Meet The Feebles"" is exemplary filmmaking.

No one has the slightest clue about how difficult it is to make a film, let alone one starring only puppets.  Jackson's direction is unbelievably clever yet plays a trick on the viewer: you're gonna forget that these are puppets after -- maybe -- seven minutes, these characters are so unique and well-developed.  Plus the shoestring budget could only have been aided by imagination, so fortunately Jackson has that in spades.

The draw of such an ambitious, utterly uncompromising project as this lives inside the dialogue and interaction, not plot progression.  You want the plot?  A chronicle of the twelve hours leading up to the infamous ""Feebles Variety Hour Massacre"" that would forever shake the world of Puppeton.  There, that's the plot.  If puppets acted as crazed, stoned, and unpredictably as ordinary people, that hypothesis is fully realized in ""Meet The Feebles.""  And, though too many people cannot help but grimace and make yucky-face whenever someone spits out this title, this is one of the most brazenly hilarious and smartest satires on the entertainment industry I've seen yet.  Yes, hilarious as in ""funny"".  Even when the lines aren't funny, their delivery certainly is.  ""Did I tell you Sandy's slapping a paternity suit on me?"" -- is straight outta Liverpool, baby.

Everyone else that reviews this has given you the cast roster, so I won't bother.  But the true scene-stealers are Trevor, Winyard, Louie and Heidi at the finale, for obvious reasons.  Star-crossed lovers get engaged after nine hours of knowing each other.  A bloated ""Feeble"" producer screws a pussycat behind his wife's back while drug-dealing with underworld kingpins.  A pesky fly-on-the-wall extorts a disease-ridden bunny out of his life insurance just to keep his sex scandal out of the hotsheets.  And a 'Nam-vet frog suffers through combat flashbacks and hustles his next quick dope fix before his big knife-throwing routine.  Oh, and a perverted, panty-sniffing anteater holds the key to the next evolution in hardcore bondage films...  These are the dreams that Peter Jackson is made of.

Christ, I quote from this film almost every day, the dialogue is THAT good.  Even if Jackson's self-proclaimed sense of humor is moronic, it's probably some of the smartest idiocy ever produced.  That aside, yes, indeed the film is, above all, very creepy, very lurid, very disturbing.  The puppets themselves look like something split between your best childhood imaginary friend and your worst nightmare simultaneously.  (Jackson also helped design the puppets as well as being the camera operator, co-writer, co-producer and director.)  Ah yes, the sheer thrill of guerrilla filmmaking, and this is a prime example of it, folks.  He photographs the puppets as he would real people, thereby disjoining your association that these are just pieces of designer fabric with human hands shoved up the wah-zoo, or life-sized costumes, or marionettes, or whatever.

And did I mention the songs in this film?  They're fabulous. Catchy, simple, stuck in your head for days.  ""One Leg Missing"", sung by a blunt-smoking Raasta-dog, is my favorite.

Forget the fact that what these puppets are doing is vile and degradable, because actual people do all of these things, too.  Is this film for kids?  Holy S---, NO!  Is it an acquired taste? Hell yes, it is.  Is it wholy unpleasant and something that can make you nauseous just watching it?  Abso-flogging-lutely, people!  Is ""Meet The Feebles"" so consciously tasteless that it achieves its own level of absurdist brilliance through its stabs at all the worst human vices, and can stand on its own as a superb puppet film, musical, comedy, and low-budget creep exercise...?

697670,4,630363270X,"If only Peter Jackson had continued in this vein.  We never would have had to suffer the nine hours of pain that was 'Lord of the Rings.' Jackson once had a true sense of grossness and bad taste comparable to that of John Waters, and his name is spoken with a hushed reverance by many gore-lovers; what happened?  Well, Jackson got greedy and sold out.

Before he began his sad trek to commerciality, he completed three movies that were cheap, disgusting, and deliriously funny. 'Bad Taste' was the first, basically a home movie elevated to the status of a cult masterpiece by its sense of black humor about severed body parts which was an obvious homage to classic zombie flicks; the third is 'Dead Alive,' an even more absurdly over-the-top zombie parody with an almost slapstick sensibility and a budget big enough to allow several tons of fake blood to be dumped onscreen in the notorious final sequence.

Between these gore epics is the hysterical adults-only puppet comedy 'Meet the Feebles.' Many people remark being very shocked at seeing puppets behave in this depraved manner; imagine what would have happened if Jackson had tried to do this with people.  Jackson could truly realize the sickest jokes imaginable because he could always use the excuse 'it's just a puppet.' Hence we have semen spraying from noses, gallons of barf, heads being stepped on, heads stuck up rectums, sadomasochism, anal sex, oral sex, and practically the entire cast graphically killed and/or dismembered by a machine gun.

All of this is well-complemented by the shabbiness of the puppets and the grainy photography.  The unglamorous appearance of these puppets, whether intentional or not, perfectly sends up the gloss of Jim Henson's creations.  And despite the cheap appearance, the puppeteering is excellent and the voicing is good, so that the characters are quite lifelike.  There isn't much plot here; this is basically a satire of the celebrity lifestyle, which is everything but the elegant, carefree dream life we average people imagine it to be.  A necessity for all with a sick sense of humor, but proceed with caution; not to be watched with the easily offended or with parents around.",1091923200,4,2189,4.972602739726027

697675,4,630363270X,"I've seen a lot of bizarre movies. Unusual, weirdo films are one of my biggest passions. I can easily say that Meet The Feebles ranks as one of the most bizarre, even downright crazy films that I've ever seen. It's about a puppet variety show, similar to Jim Henson's Muppet Show from the 1970s, The Feebles Variety Hour. It begins with a little musical number, ""Meet The Feebles"", complete with a singing hippo, bunny and all sorts of other creatures. Unlike the Muppet Show, however, Meet The Feebles is far from wholesome, as the backstage lives of the performers reveal. The boss, a giant walrus, makes porno films in the basement involving a cow in S&M gear. The walrus also does drug deals with an evil warthog. There's a heroin-addicted Vietnam Vet frog, a hippo with an eating disorder, a rabbit who believes he has AIDS, you get the picture. The film's finale must be seen to be believed. The hippo loses it and goes on a shooting spree while a fox sings a production number about sodomy. At this point, the viewer must think to him or herself, ""this is one ... up movie"". It will make you laugh, it will make you cringe, it will shock and disturb you, it will make you question the sanity of the filmmakers that made it.
The filmmakers who made Meet The Feebles, oddly enough, are now Academy Award nominees. Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh (director and co-screenwriters of The Lord of the Rings trilogy) were responsible for this sick little film. Who would have guessed that a mere ten years after making Meet The Feebles, Peter Jackson would be directing the greatest fantasy epic in film history. A grand epic completely devoid of vomit, porno and drug-addicted animals. Well, it's a crazy business. Peter Jackson earned himself a large cult of fans with his early films beginning with Bad Taste, a horror-comedy about aliens invading New Zealand and dining on the inhabitants. Meet The Feebles followed, and then came Dead Alive (aka Braindead) in 1992, a  film that still ranks as one of the goriest movies in existence. These films cemented Jackons's status as a cult film icon. Now, added to that cult are millions of J.R.R. Tolkien fans, and soon Jackson may even claim the title of Oscar winner.
Anyone who was introduced to Jackson via Lord of the Rings would be interested to see his early films, but they should be cautious. He was a daring low-budget filmmaker. Admittedly, demented at times, he nonetheless displays a true passion for his craft. The title of his first film, Bad Taste, lets you know what to expect from his early films. They display a joyous dementia that is sure to offend prudish types. Those who get the joke however, will be delighted with his audacity and enjoy the ride.
Cult movie fans should certainly check out Meet The Feebles and Jackson's other early films. Just be sure that you know what you're in for.",1075075200,,2856,4.6779324055666

The scene in which the drug addicted frog is placed in a vietnam P.O.W. camp demonstrates how a coward would act in a game of russian roulette, instead of taking the typical hollywood way out of the scene where he would save his fellow prisoner, he takes of with him only to betray him when he falls in to a pit.

697679,1,630363270X,"Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles is the worst movie ever made. There is no word in the English language that describes how vile, disgusting, and wrong the film is. Peter Jackson manages to offend every sense that is used to view his work, resulting in the worst aesthetic experience possible.
One way to describe Meet the Feebles is Jim Henson's Muppets - on crack. Imagine the Muppets in a very adult world where drugs, sex, and violence are commonplace. The opening scene of Meet the Feebles seems harmless enough, but right after the horribly-written theme song is a scene which burns the eyes: Muppets having sex. I suppose that Peter Jackson was trying to shock audiences, but it just ends up being disgusting. The rest of the movie progressively gets worse and worse. You know it's bad when you are `treated' to a reenactment of the Vietnam war, Muppet-style.
Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles has left a scar on my innocence that will require intensive, expensive therapy to heal. Now I find it hard to watch children's television shows without thinking about the finale of Meet the Feebles where one of the puppets goes on a rampage and kills every other character in the movie with a machine gun. Whenever I see Lord of the Rings it evokes images of a giant cockroach sodomizing a large cow-woman. I find it hard to believe that a sick and twisted man like Peter Jackson was chosen to direct a reputable film like Lord of the Rings.

The plot is about an ensemble puppet cast that is trying to tie together loose ends as they get ready for the big Muppet Show like opening night. The humor is almost constant, and this is certainly not for children.  The dvd offers nothing more than trailers for lame movies.  The transfer is also lousy.

697762,5,630363270X,"It would take someone as talented as Peter Jackson to make ""Meet the Feebles"" -- a gross, sick, absurd and twistily logical dark (very dark) comedy. If ""Frighteners"" was Jackson's version of ""Ghostbusters,"" then this is his even weirder version of the ""Muppet Show."" (Not one for kids, either)
The not-so-good ""Feebles"" variety show has just scored a network special, with buxom singer Heidi the Hippo as the central attraction. Behind the scenes, it's another story: Heidi's lover Bletch the Walrus is cheating on her with a slinky Siamese, Wynard the Vietnam-scarred frog hasn't been able to get more heroin and is having problems with his knife-throwing act (you can imagine what happens), a rat is making pornos in the basement, a blue elephant is embroiled in a paternity suit with a chicken (guess what the kid looks like), Harry the rabbit has come down with a venereal disease, and new porcupine Robert has fallen in love with a beautiful chorus girl.
To make things worse, Bletch is involved in a scheme with underworld drug kingpins, one of whom is a whale of a problem (seriously -- he's a whale). Heidi is pigging out on chocolate and starting to come unglued mentally out of fear that her lover doesn't care about her anymore. And when the curtain goes up, will the Feebles be able to get their acts together? (I'll give you a hint: The answer has two letters)
Peter Jackson once said that he had a ""moronic"" sense of humor, and it shows here in all its grimy glory. What if the Muppet Show were plagued with every kind of seediness? Sex, drugs, puppet porn and some really disgusting vomiting (and cast members occasionally eating one another), and a machine-gun massacre are spattered over this story -- and while you may not want to, you'll love it.  Jackson's love of splatter-gore shows in a row of birds crushed by a barrel and plenty of flying body parts near the finale. It's so incredibly in ""bad taste"" that I simply couldn't stop laughing. (Warning to those with weak stomachs: This movie is not for you) He even touches on some interesting questions like: What kind of offspring would two puppets of different species have?
Several of the characters are reminiscent of Muppets -- a blowsy diva who storms off when she's unhappy, there's a frog, a chicken who's had an affair with a long-nosed blue guy, a nasty little rat... any of it sound familiar? Jackson takes the concept and runs with it. And there are a bunch spawned especially for this movie, like the glittering fish that Bletch eats, or a malevolent little fly-on-the-wall who takes pleasure in spreading bad news.
Most of the characters are either pitiful (Heidi) or revolting (the lecherous, manipulative Bletch). They make porn, they dish dirt, they snort drugs, they bounce into each other's dressing rooms. (There's even a pervert anteater and a fox who does a very dignified -- yet obscene -- musical number!) And Jackson knows to balance out all the wretched characters with likable ones too: Arfur the doe-eyed worm and Lucille (poodle) and Robert (porcupine) as the adoring lovers.
The downside? The DVD is fuzzy and overly dark in places, like a videotape that has aged badly. This is a particular problem in scenes that take place in semi-darkness, which many backstage ones do. The extras are... more or less nonexistant. Hopefully this film will be rereleased in a format more worthy of it.
You might be able to watch Kermit and Miss Piggy and the rest of the Muppets after you've seen ""Meet the Feebles."" But I promise you that you will never, ever watch them the same way again. ""Meet the Feebles"" is sick, silly, and utterly twisted -- not a masterpiece, but brilliantly, weirdly, insanely funny.",1053388800,63,3698,4.78716744913928

This is as close to an indicator of how much tastelessness one can endure as humanly possible (though even my dog bolted from the room during one of the more nauseating moments).
The disc, however, is one of the poorest transfers I've ever seen.  Both the VHS and the now out of print original Substance DVD release had clearer pic & sound.  There's really not much of a platform to gripe with such a low price, but a movie of this caliber deserves better.
Not sure if there is a rights issue with the film (Bad Taste is out on Anchor Bay, Dead Alive on Trimark/Lions Gate/Live, Heavenly Creatures on Miramax) which is preventing an acceptable print for Feebles.

This dvd is clearly encoded from a very inferior source - it's also pan and scan, which stinks. The sound is muddied and very difficult to listen to, obscuring much of the dialogue. The print of the film was obviously a release print, with many scratches and missing frames. The transfer is very dark and muddy, oscuring many of the scenes and making it difficult to watch.
On top of all this, it appears that this may be taken from a vhs release of the film! And, there are encoding errors on the dvd, so that it gets stuck, or digital fragments appear.
That is what may make this the worst dvd ever. The quality of the tranfer and encoding is nowhere near good vhs standards, much less good dvd standards.
And then there is the film itself. This is one of those impossible to rate films, because many people will watch it and go ""Yuck! This isn't a film, it's garbage!"", while others, who enjoy the sicker things in life, with say ""Cool!""
So, here's how you decide which category you are in:
If you enjoy watching puppets curse, vomit, defecate, urinate, fornicate, come down with venereal disease, do drug deals, do drugs, and shoot each other up with machine guns, then this film is right up your alley. It is NOT a children's film, that's for sure.
If you don't enjoy these things, then simply don't watch this film. You won't find any of the things that you enjoy about Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" films here. Absolutely nothing, except perhaps some careful planning.

Muppets on Acid. OK, good concept, and the visuals certainly were sick and twisted. But that's about where the credit due ends - there is nothing more to this movie that makes it redeemable, and that's why it gets one star.
About ten minutes into the film, it was dawning on me that I hadn't laughed or cracked a smile once yet. Twenty minutes later, I realized it again, and I shut the movie off. There are plots in the film, but they are there to just ""have a point"" to the movie, and they don't work. I don't think any humor was even ATTEMPTED in this film.
In the thirty minutes that I watched before I shut it off, I saw some graphic puppet sex that had no reason for being in there except for the reason that it could be easily done, and it would be gross. Again, I am not offended, but there was really no reason for it - just ""because they could.""
Also, I could hardly understand what the characters were saying with their warped voices placed upon New Zealand accents.

Upon seeing the film, I was convinced that Jackson was a great director and wanted to watch some of his other pictures. I thoroughly enjoyed THE FRIGHTENERS and caught the last fifteen minutes of DEAD ALIVE on cable and knew that I hadn't been wrong. I saw MEET THE FEEBLES in an art house video store and decided to rent it to further my appreciation of Jackson.

After viewing the picture, my view of Jackson as a director has not changed. MEET THE FEEBLES is filled with literary and movie references (the DEER HUNTER rip-off is classic). It satirizes the entertainment industry and it is filled with interesting dialogue and fully developed characters.

However, with that said, MEET THE FEEBLES is one sick and bizarre movie. It's full of filthy language, pornography, S & M, drug abuse, sodomy, and violence. Some of the scenes aren't all that bad, but some of the stuff is just awful. I understand much of the humor involved, but I just don't comprehend why people find it funny. As a huge Muppets fan, I was also upset by the obvious perverted parody of the Muppet Show that MEET THE FEEBLES is. Everything that the Muppets are and that Jim Henson was, the Feebles are not. Not only that, but the film verges several times on the edge of NC-17 (there is one scene where a male puppets' private organs are graphically shown and exploited; in a regular film that would have guaranteed the NC-17 rating).

The extras include trailers for all the lousy, stupid low-budget films the company releasing the DVD (DEAD ALIVE PRODUCTIONS)has available. And that's it.

The transfer by Dead Alive Productions (not to be confused with anything Peter Jackson) is horrible.  It is incredibly dark, grainy, and full of spots and lines that sneak into the picture.  Most of the movie takes place in the dark backstage area of an old theatre, and the transfer makes it very difficult to see what's going on.  Feature-wise, this disc is bare.  You never realize how much you value Chapter Headings as a feature until you get a disc without them!  That's right folks, this movie is one big chapter, 1 hour 30 minutes long.  Want to stop and do something else?  You can't, or you'll lose your place.  I should make a correction: there are chapters on this disc, but they're in the preview section for other Dead Alive Productions ""films"" like The Ice Cream Man, The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, and Blood Camp 2.  Overall, this is a great movie almost ruined by a terrible transfer.  Shame on whoever is exploiting Peter's great work like this.  Here's hoping for an official release sometime soon.

What I wasn't familiar with is the poor quality output from Dead Alive Productions! This story, which revolves around a group of sick, twisted puppets (which, of course, I like) was so poorly transferred onto DVD that I felt the urge to write my first review in here.  Not only are there no added features, not only is it NOT in Widescreen format, but worst of all is that it appears they took a very (and I mean very) poor quality print of the film and just slapped it onto a dvd.  It is grainy and dark; so dark that I thought I needed cataract surgury.  My tape of the movie off of TV is a much better print.  And they have the nerve to leech off of Peter Jackson's success with ""Lord of the Rings"" by advertising this fact right on the front, in the middle of the clamshell case of Meet the Feebles; which I guess would be fine if this dvd were of a higher quality.

697956,4,630363270X,"Very hard to imagian, huh?  This sick and twisted muppets on acid flick is made from the werid, at lest at one point, mind of Peter Jackson.....who, happens to be the director of all THREE Lord of the Rings movie.
I know what your thinking, with this on his resume along with other early greats (Bad Taste, Dead Alive, The Frighteners, and the great Heavenly Creatures) it's hard to come to relize how he got to do all three big budget movies.
But anyway back to the Feebles his 2nd movie.  The Feebles are a bunch of talented puppets, think The Muppets Show but extreamly messed up, who must get ready for their big show called....Meet the Feebles.
The Feeble cast is a large one:
Robert - An idealistic hedgehog who just joined the Feebles.
Lucille - She's some sort of pooch.
Heidi - The hippo, talented star of the Feebles Variety Hour show.
Bletch - Walrus manager of the Feebles, he uses and abuses others.
Trevor - The dirty rat, literally. Sinister assistant to Bletch he's been dealing drugs to the other puppets and making pornos in the basement.
Wynyard - Frog who came back from Vietnam hooked on pretty much everything, he even has flashbacks at times.
Harry - Rabbit, a famous actor who believes he is dying of a STD for most of the film.
Sebastion - Gay director of the Feebles Chorus.
Barry - Bulldog enforcer for Bletch.
Arthur - The worm.
FW - The fly, a reporter for the local tabloid out to find dirt on the Feebles.
Sidney, Sandy, and Baby - Sidney is the elephant, he trains these little furball things. Sandy (a chicken) is taking him to court for child support, he denies it's his.
Samantha - Slut cat who has been having an affair with Bletch
Dennis -  A panty sniffing anteater
Cedrick and Louie - Warthog and mangy dog, both are drug suppliers.
Abi - Indian contortionist.
As you can see, there are a ton of chearcter's in this movie each with his or her own background story and plotline....but they all end up looking the same when it's all over. :-D
This movie isn't for kids nor is it for the people who can't conrole their upchunk reflects...there are many parts that are gross and vile (the Fly eatting for one....sick) and shouldn't be watched if you can hold your own.  VERY FUN STUFF though.
This DVD shows the Feebles in all their glorious faishon and they have never looked better it's just too bad the audio isn't great and there are no extras on the disc; still even with the lackings...this disc is a must have.",1017792000,2,2452,4.466517857142857
697957,4,630363270X,"Imagine a movie that quotes liberally from some of the most nefarious moments in film history:  The Russian Roulette scene from ""The Deer Hunter""; the toilet scene and the abundant heroin use from ""Trainspotting""; the hyper-emesis from ""Stand By Me"" (and/or ""South Park""); the carnage of ""Saving Private Ryan""; the multiple male orgasms of ""Happiness""; and, most disturbingly, the coprophagy of ""Pink Flamingos"".  Imagine a movie that constantly barrages its audience with these scenes, all cranked-up and amped-up to the point of submission.  Imagine that this movie is, between its more nauseous moments, terribly funny, exceedingly satirical, scabrous, morbid, dark, and witty.  Now, imagine this movie as performed by the cast of the Muppet Show.
You need not go through the trouble of imagining this movie.  If you have already, my apologies.  But if you're still up to the challenge, all you need to do is see ""Meet the Feebles"".
Peter Jackson (and who else is shocked that he had ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in him after seeing ""The Feebles""?) directs with abandon and glee, allowing his camera to swoop and swerve through the Feebles backstage dressing areas like a demented fly (that's not just an empty metaphor; this movie actually has a demented fly as one of its secondary characters!).  It travels between the legs of a giant hippo (and up her skirt, too!), around corners, up to the ceilings, and back down to the floor.  Around every corner it finds something remarkable to watch.  Over here they're filming a porno movie featuring a cow endowed with an enormous udder.  Over there is a giant walrus copulating with a pussycat.
But Jackson is not concerned with bad taste just for bad taste's sake.  He has things to say within all the inhumanity and depravity.  There's a condemnation of promiscuous sex in the post-AIDS era.  A scathing portrait of the public's appetite for tabloid journalism.  A scene of adultery leads to one character's self-destruction.  There's a near rape, a drug buy gone horribly bad, and even a paternity case served against a blue elephant by a chicken!  And, most intriguing, a Vietnam flashback sequence, brought on by the heroin-induced paranoia of a wayward frog.  It is more harrowing than anything you'll see in any other war movie.  It's played for laughs at times, but it's also played very stark and very real.
The Feebles being the cast of a variety show, the film also has some show-stopping musical numbers.  I dare you to get ""Garden of Love"" out of your head after the movie is over (you'll also want to get the sight of the giant Heidi the Hippo crooning it out of your head too).  And then there's the song performed by stage manager Sebastian the fox.  If the lyrics (from the chorus: ""You must think it very odd of me / that I enjoy the act of sodomy"") don't have you scurrying for cover under your seat then the production number, the sets, and the dancing (!) surely will.
It's hard to believe that a man can make a movie like ""Meet the Feebles"", and still have enough bad taste left in him to make a film called ""Bad Taste"".  But Jackson has.  It's a carefully crafted social satire, full of verbal (listen closely for the sublime ""A Passage to India"" punch line) and visual wit.  I consider myself pretty tolerant of bad taste, but even I found myself watching this film through my fingers.  But isn't it the role of the artist to find the line of good taste, and smash it to smithereens?",1017619200,,3457,4.740802675585284

Then I watched it agian becouse the first time I had no idea what to make of it. After watching it a second time I must admit that as much as I wanted to hate this movie I just couldn't.
  The plot is simple enough. Meet the Feebles is the name of of a tv show that has plans to go national (The same as the Muppets) however any comparison to the Muppets ends when the shows production manager, a rat named Trevor, calls the show's star a hippo named Hidi, a fat slag, from there the movie just gets stranger. The charactors ars as follows, Treveo the rat who in his spare time makes porn/snuff films in the theaters basement for Bletch the barins behind the Feebles,he's a drug dealing,womenizing walrus and the love of Hidi's life. There's a Vienam Vet knife thrower who is now a hedion addict,a love sick newcommer, a deadbeat dad of an elephant, and a fox who tries to save the show by singing his famous song Sodamy (I'm not kidding).
  For all it's strangness the is a real likability to the movie, the charators are well devloped and the music (all original) is at time's quite good. Although Jackson will be remembered for Lord Of The Rings Meet the Feebles is one hell of a ride worth taking.

697965,2,630363270X,"I did not finish watching Peter Jackson's ""Meet the Feebles"". About 45 minutes into the movie, I became bored and shut it off, deciding that it was time to go to bed. There weren't any points in the movie where I found myself laughing. I'm assuming that the rest of the movie, after the point I watched to, is the funny part... But I wasn't willing to sit through it to get to the funny stuff. I think a lot of people, myself included, find the idea of naughty puppets incredibly hilarious. This movie, however, was not the film we are looking for.
Maybe I'm simply desensitized, but I found ""Meet the Feebles"" neither shocking nor disturbing. It seems to me that they were going for things that were outrageous, like a walrus mating with a cat, but falling short of the bar. There isn't any sort of social commentary that usually goes along with arthouse flicks which are filmed poorly (and make no mistake here, ""Meet the Feebles"" is filmed poorly) and the story seems almost forced, as if the writers decided - ""Hey, let's make a movie about nasty Muppets!"" - but then realized that a story is necessary. Scenes jump all over the place and the puppet animation is choppy. I got the impression that some scenes were shot stop-motion, like claymation films. The smut-producing rat wasn't anything to sing home about and neither was the knife-throwing (frog, lizard?). This obviously isn't something you should show to any immature kids, despite it's failure to be abhorrent to me.
Not to get down on Peter Jackson and anyone else who was involved - I love Fellowship and Heavenly Creatures and all - but this movie is downright terrible. There is a reason that I gave it 2 stars, though. They were going somewhere with ""Wobeht"" the hedgehog.

Jackson takes the basic concept of the Muppet show (combining puppets and humans in animal costumes to tell the story about the action backstage at a popular variety show) but carries the concept to a sick extreme, creating a hybrid offspring of the Muppets and such schlock entertainment-industry classics as The Valley of the Dolls.  For example, look at the absurdity of the relationship between Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.  In the Feebles, animal characters eat other animal characters or have hybrid offspring.  Characters have drug addictions, extramarital affairs, degenerative diseases, star in S&M porn movies on the side, etc.  There is an amazing Deer Hunter inspired Nam flashback, a hillarious war between drug dealers and some entertainment bigwigs on a pier (which includes a whale, giant crabs and a giant spider), bodily fluids fly all over the place, a massacre ensues near the end, and it is all topped of by a ""where are they now"" type of ending as in Animal House or American Graffitti.

It isn't, and it  isn't even close. If you want shocking, buy a copy of Pasolini's Salo, or  even _Dead Alive_, which will leave you speechless.
From the other  reviews, you can tell what _Meet the Feebles_ is about. A group of puppets  work on a popular show called the Feebles Variety Hour. Backstage, they  engage in disgusting and all too human habits. Drug abuse, pornography,  murder, etc. are all shown in pretty vivid detail. But it just isn't that  big of a deal. We have all seen this behavior depicted before. And  substituting puppets for people doesn't make it any more shocking.
There  are good things to be said about the film. The puppet work is absolutely  fantastic. It must have taken forever to shoot these scenes. They come  across as nearly perfect. Some of the characters are better then others.  Watch for the dope-addled frog and his flashback to Vietnam.

698081,2,630363270X,"To be fair, I can understand why people would enjoy this movie.  It's a funny concept, there are some funny moments, and it's depraved, but in a funny sort of way.  That's about where my appreciation of the movie stops.  To be honest, I didn't find it offensive, just incredibly boring.  Any one  who has sat through a more mainstream entertainment, like 8mm for example,  won't find it all that shocking in comparision.  The only twist is that  it's a puppet show, but even that isn't took shocking.  In addition to  finding it boring, I found to be pointless.  What were they trying to  achieve here?  If this is a satire on children's entertainment, why not  throw in a bright musical number?  This could show how false and empty  children's entertainment is, in contrast to how depraved this version of it  is.",953164800,,814,4.619718309859155

Indian contortionist, the Vietnam veteran junkie frog, and  the gay dog stage manager. Add some wholesome family puppet sex scenes with  Samantha the Pussy and Mr. Bletch the drug-dealing porno-filming walrus,  and you've got some great entertainment for the whole family - provided  your whole family is into perverted fun, that is!

It is, however, for grown up children of the muppet  generation who want to know how those furry little perverts really would  have acted. For truly disgusting movies, see 'Blood Sucking Freaks', which  is morally indefensible. For truly bad movies, see 'Burial of the Rats' by  Roger Corman, or 'Hard to Die'. This is a creative movie about puppets  being bad that could only be disliked by people who ignored the cover of  and the plot summary on the box and deluded themselves into thinking this  movie could produce a ""tickle-me-sado-masochistic cockroach""",939254400,2,733,4.9105691056910565
698167,4,630363270X,"Well, at long last I've seen the film I've only heard talked about, Peter Jackson's ""Meet the Feebles"". A truly inventive and original film which also takes the honour of being the only film I've ever seen to make  me physically ill. I made it all the way through the film, but as certain  scenes flashed through my mind as the tape rewound I couldn't contain  myself and I actually puked. Honestly. This film isn't for everyone,  there's some serious filth mixed in with the inventiveness, but if you have  to see it, it's worth the effort. I can't say I'll ever watch the film  again, but it was worth seeing once. Which in and of itself is an  interesting thing I find. There's only one other film I've ever seen that  has elicited that ""I think it's brilliant but I never want to see it  again"" response from me. The other film I speak of is ""Kids""  which I found completely intriguing and convincing, but so profoundly  depressing and scary that I could never watch it again, but where as Kids  is too powerfull for me to watch again, Feebles is too disgusting for me to  watch again. Peter Jackson is currently working on ""The Lord of the  Rings"" trillogy, so if you have a keen interest in film and LotR, I  highly recomend going through his body of work, this is a man who loves the  medium of film and is willing to take the big risks for the sake of his  art.

You can tell that the people involved had a lot of fun making this film and I have a feeling that you will love it too. Two notes worth making is that the DVD version that I got does not have any audio options in the menu and there are a few points in the film in which it is a little difficult to make out what is being said (due to volume).  The other is that there are zero special features, which is pretty sad as behind the scenes/making of material would have been a lot of fun.

If you are offended by some of the stuff that goes on in South Park then you should probably steer clear of this movie. Peter Jackson pretty much did this do-it-yourself muppets-gone-bad comedy before he became famous. But these are not your parent's muppets. This is NOT a family movie. These puppets are rude, crude and just plain nasty.  Topics include sex, drug addition, black marketeering, bathroom humor and a whole host of similar unsavory topics.
