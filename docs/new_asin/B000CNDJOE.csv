8099568,5,B000CNDJOE,"Lynne Robinson is reported to be the Pilates instructor with the most DVD's in circulation...I can see why! Her presentation and instructions are clear. I am new to Pilates and have taken about six classes from an excellent teacher, who has trained other professionals for 10 years. Now my instructor uses a technique that I passed along from Lynne's DVD.",1357430400,3,355,4.933333333333334
8099569,5,B000CNDJOE,"WOW!!! Thats all I can say about this DVD!!! The workouts are so low impact that you actually don't feel like its doing any good when you're in the workout. But sure enough after 2 weeks of doing one workout a day, 5 days a week, I noticed toning in all parts of my body. As you get used to the movements you begin to be able to concentrate on specific muscle movements and maximise your results. I would definitly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to tone up. Stick to it and you'll see the same results I did.",1175040000,12,516,4.118811881188119
