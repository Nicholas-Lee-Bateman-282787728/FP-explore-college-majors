8442554,3,B004V2D6RM,"HAQEEQAT was a hit too which released in 1995. The film starts off well though the going-ons are predictable yet it is well handled we have romance in Switzerland, lot of comedy, emotions and drama yet it s well handled

There are some good scenes like Amrish Puri coming to know the truth of Ajay after he accidentally praised him for his humanity a minute back Ajay saving children and Tabu knowing the truth

The film does have some bizarre scenes like Ajay saving Tabu from the cage and some more

Direction by Kuku Kohli is good Music is good, DIL NE DIL SE stands out

Ajay Devgan lends his part the right amount of emotions and vulnerability and conveys through his eyes though he has done such roles many times Tabu too looks nice and does a good job Amrish Puri has done such roles many times but yet he is lovable Himani Shivpuri is okay Johny Lever is funny Rami Reddy, Mohan Joshi are the villains Satyen Kapoo is as usual, Ishrat Ali is okay Aruna Irani is likable",1304467200,,977,4.3812154696132595
