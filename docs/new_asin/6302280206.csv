449981,4,6302280206,"Affair In Trinidad (1952) was made to re-team Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford who created such a sensation in Gilda in 1946. On it's own, Affair In Trinidad, is a very enjoyable Film Noir mystery thriller with a couple of steamy song and dance routines executed beautifully, as only Rita Hayworth can do. However, in a side by side comparison to Gilda, it is a disappointment, but still worth watching, none-the-less. For those of you who have never seen Gilda, do yourself a favor, and watch it. Gilda is one of the truly great films of the 1940s. You will not be disappointed in this Film Noir mystery thriller, with great performances, some snappy dialog and a few twists and turns that will hold your attention to the very end.",1217376000,15,728,4.607692307692307
449982,5,6302280206,"This is an excellent ""Who-dun-it"" starring Glenn Ford, Rita Hayworth, and Alexander Scourby. Rita's husband dies of an apparent suicide...BUT...was it really a suicide and not a murder. Glenn Ford is the dead man's brother who comes to Trinidad to investigate and catch the killer. Suspects are the widow herself and a rich man she has a relationship with. Others in the cast add mystery and there are a couple of musical numbers by Hayworth. Sort of Film Noir and a very good mystery. Worth watching.",1217116800,19,501,4.837209302325581
449983,3,6302280206,"1952's Affair in Trinidad was an attempt by Columbia to reignite some of the heat that Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford brought to Gilda six years earlier with director Vincent Sherman drafted in to give it some of the snappy style of his Warner Bros. pictures, but with somewhat more tepid results all round (except at the box-office, where it surprisingly proved an even bigger hit). It's the kind of film you know you haven't seen before but you could swear you had so predictably familiar is the formula - tropical location, a couple of sultry musical numbers, Alexander Scourby in the George Macready role, although in this case it might be more accurate to say the Claude Rains role, since the last half of the movie is pure Notorious as Hayworth's suddenly widowed singer tries to find out just what his millionaire purveyor of stolen information is up to with those ex-Nazi scientists who are staying in his guest house. Ford often has so little to do as her suspicious brother-in-law here that you hope they at least paid him well for his time. Hayworth is center stage all the way, and if the choreography of her opening number is more comical than erotic she's the main reason for watching it, although there are good supporting turns from Scourby and Torin Thatcher, a not-entirely-geographically-logical MacGuffin that predates the Cuban Missile Crisis by nearly a decade and one character gets a great last line - ""If you're waiting for my last words, you've heard them.""

Neither particularly bad or particularly good, it fills an aimless afternoon but leaves little impression in its wake. No extras on the vanilla Region 2 PAL DVD but an acceptable black and white transfer.",1194912000,2,1687,4.837370242214533
449984,4,6302280206,"After her divorce from Prince Aly Khan, Rita Hayworth returned to America and Columbia immediately put her into this film, reuniting her with her favorite costar, Glenn Ford.  Writer and producer of ""Gilda"" , Virginia Van Upp, was also on board, as was Stephen Geray who had portrayed Uncle Pio in the earlier film.

It is a noir along the lines of the aformentioned movie, with Rita portraying Trinidad cafe dancer Chris Emery, whose husband, Neal, is the owner of the joint.  The authorities show up one evening after her dance routine to inform her that her spouse has apparently committed suicide.  Although shocked, she later cooperates with police when they conclude that he actually was murdered and they ask her to help with the investigation.  They suspect the wealthy playboy Max Fabian (Alexander Scourby), of the crime, and since he is infatuated with Chris, she can get close to him.  Neal's older brother, Steve (Ford) arrives, unaware of his brother's death, but once he learns of it, he is determined to find out the truth.  He is suspicious of Chris, but he is also attracted to her - something he tries to conceal.  As Chris cannot reveal what she is up to, Steve begins to suspect that she knows more about Neal's death than she will admit.  He is infuriated further by Fabian, who makes it no secret that he desires her.  This leads to a showdown at the villain's mansion, with a strew of menacing, secondary characters to supply a sub-plot of spies and world control a la Gilda.

Although not quite on par with the earlier Hayworth/Ford teaming, this is an entertaining picture that should please the viewer in the way of suspense, intrigue, and of course, the electricity generated between the two stars. And the songs (Rita's vocals were dubbed by Jo Ann Greer), ""Trinidad Lady"", and ""I've Been Kissed Before"", steamy dance routines (created by Valerie Bettis, who appears as the wife of one of the spies), and the gowns by Jean Louis are definately a highlight.

Definately a must for Rita and Glenn fans.

Update - the film was released on region 1 DVD in 2008.  Good to have it, although I thought it could have gotten more extras - but this is Columbia, so one shouldn't expect that to happen too often.",1145750400,8,2230,4.699228791773779
449985,2,6302280206,"""Gilda"" is a great nasty film noir, in which Glenn Ford isn't quite man enough to take on Rita Hayworth, and she keeps flaunting it in his face. Will he step up to the plate... or burst into tears? If you're a fan of that movie hoping for more of their unique sado-masochistic chemistry, forget it. ""Affair in Trinidad"" is a third-rate knockoff of Notorious, but director Vincent Sherman is no Charles Vidor. In fact, he's nobody. The stars don't make fools of themselves as they did in their ludicrous ""Carmen,"" but duller isn't necessarily better. She throws her hair around energetically, but years of hard living had taken their toll, and you know Hayworth is in trouble when you find yourself wondering if she's wearing a wig. ""Gilda"" was Ford's finest hour, maybe because his usual scowling tough guy act was framed up as a paper-thin cover for sexual ambiguity. Here, he looks like he can barely keep himself from stomping off the set in disgust. You're luckier than he was: you have a remote.",1055462400,6,1000,4.6875
449986,3,6302280206,"On the orders of Columbia studio head Harry Cohn, Rita Hayworth was transformed from a latin B player to an A picture love goddess, her high spirits passing as all-American in titles like Cover Girl and Gilda. However the curse of the beautiful is that they become possessions by collectors, just as Rita told screenwriter of Gilda, Virginia Van Upp - men fell in love with Gilda but woke up with me. Her greatest collector was Prince Aly Khan, and the idea of capturing a movie star predated Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier in the 1950's. However the Hayworth/Khan marriage failed and Rita returned to Hollywood. Perhaps in a depression, unhappy with the vehicle provided for her comeback role, or simply older, Hayworth's sparkle had dimmed. That's not to say that she doesn't look beautiful in the film. Whilst not lit as gorgeously as she was by Rudolph Mate in Gilda, she has a moment here standing in repose in shadow, smoking. But even with her character being a recent widow, her voice is dead and she carries herself like a somnambulist. She is best when she is dancing as she does twice here. In the first, Trinidad Lady, is the Carmen Rita - barefoot and tossing her dress. The framing distances us - director Vincent Sherman may be more interested in the crowd around the stage, but she looks happy performing. The second, I've Been Kissed Before, has obvious parallels to her Put The Blame on Mame from Gilda. She wears a shimmery black dress as fetishistic as the famous black satin sheath, the number is schematically arranged to present her as a tramp to later be rewarded with a face slap, even the choreography recalls that of Mame. However her announced intention to dance, even if contextualised, is a dramatic change of characterisation. She gives us the Gilda we want, and not the woman we have accepted up to this time - the one we have woken up with. The Gilda connection is made in the film by the casting of Glenn Ford as her romantic partner, thankfully treating her a little kinder this time around, Steven Geray in an amusing supporting role as her employer, Alexander Scourby as a pseudo-George Macready but without the menace, the locale being Trinidad as Gilda was set in Buenos Aires and a plot about German-ish hoods investing in shady activities that pose a threat to security. Ford tells us he was a pilot in the war and since he isn't old enough to mean WW1, we know that Upp and her cowriters have written their screenplay in a rush, explaining Hayworth's own reluctance to participate. Scourby is give the witty lines like ""Some people are mellowed by drink. Have another"" and ""At the risk of dislocating your personality, try to be calm"". He has a funny exchange with Ford about Hayworth - ""I think you look lovelier in this colour than any other. Don't you agree?"" ""There's a few shades I haven't seen her in yet"". Valerie Bettis who created Rita's dances also appears as the wife of one of the Germans and her drunken energy is very welcome. She has a great laugh and even gets to parody Hayworth's dancing at one point, and Juanita Moore is good as Rita's maid. Sherman provides an exterior of an airport with seemingly limitless open skies, and gives Scourby's interior an imposing staircase. This film is not the bomb I thought it was the last time I saw it, plot holes notwithstanding, but Sherman moves things along and at least Hayworth isn't the embarassment she was in the Hall of Mirrors sequence in The Lady from Shanghai. Perhaps sadly Aly Khan took the best of her and Harry Cohn was left to salvage her career with the little she had left to give.",980640000,10,3601,4.628125
449987,4,6302280206,"The thriller plot with a beautiful woman under-cover and unable to respond to maligning suspicions seems to me to owe much to Hitchcock's sublime ""Notorious."" (The original murder mystery of the plot is never solved.  Hitchcock would not have left that hanging.)

The noirish cinematography is excellent, though  the editing cannot compare with that in ""Notorious"" (or  ""Gilda""). I find Glenn Ford's sanctimonious hard to take (here as  elsewhere).

 Primarily, however, this was a vehicle for the return  of screenn goddess Rita Hayworth in 1952, after the collapse of her  marriage to Ali Khan ended her early retirement. There is a sadness  underlying many of Rita Hayworth's sultry performances (as in  ""Gilda"").

She could most certainly dance! No one at the time  credited her with being able to act, but she could do that, too. She was so  mesmerizingly beautiful that she just had to be vapid, everyone seems to  have thought. 34 years old when she made this film, she looked  absolutely  ravishing.

The film's costume design won an Academy Award, but  in the (deservedly) best-remembered scene, she danced barefoot.",961286400,8,1125,5.116022099447513

450047,3,6302280206,"Affair in Trinidad(released July/52)stars,among others,Rita Hayworth as Chris Emery,Glenn Ford as Steve Emery and Torin Thatcher as Inspector Smythe. It is a reasonably good thriller/who done it set in the Caribbean but unfortunately its' set up doesn't follow through to the end,where it all comes unraveled and becomes too formulaic.
The story finds Hayworth married to the brother of Ford and living in Trinidad. There seems to be a debate on just what exactly Fords' brother did for a living,but he was tied up to a rich businessman on the island. The businessman is known by the police for his underhanded dealings during the war and black marketeering. Ford receives a letter to come down to Trinidad to seek out the possibility of a job. When he arrives he is greeted by a dark wreath on his brother's door and the news he is dead. Coincidentally a hearing into his brother's demise is being held and he attends to hear a verdict of suicide upheld. He returns to his brother's home and confronts Hayworth and their exchange is none too pleasant. After his temper settles she invites him to stay.
Hayworth in the meantime had been talked to by the local constabulary who know that her husband's death was not a suicide. They held the inquest as a front to bring out the real killer,who they suspect to be the rich businessman. Hayworth is to keep hush hush,even to Ford. Ford is there to get answers and he pokes around getting pieces of evidence but nothing the police will touch. Through all this he and Hayworth fall in love,but the course of true love does not run smooth,as Ford has a rival for her affections;the businessman. Hayworth has been told to finagle her way into the businessman's good graces in order to get evidence on him. This she does at a party he throws,but Ford arrives in a jealous rage and also with some evidence he has uncovered. Hayworth tells him a lie to get him away from the house,which helps save him but also turns him against her.
After things at the party calm down she goes inside a guest house and uncovers some secrets. It seems some of the businessman's guests are ex Nazi's working on some secret plans for which he has been paid handsomely for by some foreign power. But of course Hayworth gets discovered and is in peril. Ford arrives in the nick of time,but he too gets caught. Before they can take care of Haryworth and Ford the police arrive to break it all up and arrest the perps. Ford and Hayworth sail home together to start a new life together.
Unfortunately this Nazi theme was not only a constant one during WW2,but for a long time after also. It was quite well known some Nazi's fled to the Southern Hemisphere,so this film was taking advantage of that fact. But it was just too formulaic even for 1952. The film goes along quite well until we discover that fact a good part way through. I was expecting a real twist like Hayworth was the one who killed Ford's brother or something. Not to be. The film also has Hayworth mouthing her way through two musical numbers,the real singing being done by Jo Ann Greer. Many will recall policeman Thatcher in his later role as the evil magician in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.
Technically speaking the film is full frame and is generally in pretty good shape. Extras include the trailer and couple of promo items,this being part of Sony's short lived Martini Movies series.
All in all just an average who done it,whose plot goes along quite well until we discover the real reason behind the death of Ford's brother. Then it is all down hill to the happily ever after ending.",1368316800,,3573,4.593114241001565

Let me start with excerpts from two pertinent fellow amazon reviews, viz

5star-This is an excellent ""Who-dun-it"" starring Glenn Ford, Rita Hayworth, and Alexander Scourby. Rita's husband dies of an apparent suicide...BUT...was it really a suicide and not a murder. Glenn Ford is the dead man's brother who comes to Trinidad to investigate and catch the killer. Suspects are the widow herself and a rich man she has a relationship with. Others in the cast add mystery and there are a couple of musical numbers by Hayworth. Sort of Film Noir and a very good mystery. Worth watching.  ""Ace Movie Critic !!""  (Pacifica, CA)

4star-Affair In Trinidad (1952) was made to re-team Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford who created such a sensation in Gilda in 1946. ... In a side by side comparison to Gilda, it is a disappoint-ment, but still worth watching, none-the-less. John Malanga ""film guy""

I agree with both. In the wider Rita Hayworth ranking as an actress, it would be, from the top, The Lady from Shanghai, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, all top range, The loves of Carmen a bad (directors) bottom case. What is amazing - given the declared moral values of the time - is the apparent ease with which a beautiful woman is forced into a potentially deadly mission by the police - like the FBI with Ingrid Bergman in the case of Hitchcock's Notorious... No problem?

When Steve Emery (Ford) arrives in Trinidad at the urgent request of his brother, he is stunned to find that his brother has not only been murdered, but that his brother's wife Chris (Hayworth) is succumbing to the seduction attempts of the murderer. His feelings are further exacerbated when he discovers that he, too, is becoming strongly attracted to Chris, who is a steamy cabaret singer. She, in turn, is playing off one against the other while betraying the secrets of both men to the police (Thatcher), for whom she is secretly working.

Hayworth at her best!

Special footnote: ~ The song ""Rum and Coca Cola"" by The Andrews Sisters was originally a calypso song composed and performed by a Trinidad calypso band in the mid-1940s. At that time the American military maintained two bases in Trinidad. The song is about the soldiers from these bases and how a mother and daughter provided ""pleasure"" for the ""Yankee dollar"". Actually, if one walked around Port of Spain - Trinidad's capital city - during this period it was a common sight to see American soldiers and sailors with local women at hotels and bars ~ Hayworth practiced hard to try and do her own singing, but finally Morris Stoloff hired Jo Ann Greer to dub Rita's voice. Greer and Hayworth worked well together and she later dubbed Rita in ""Miss Sadie Thompson"" and ""Pal Joey"" ~

450055,4,6302280206,"Rita Hayworth's movie comeback after a four-year absence, AFFAIR IN TRINIDAD (1952) saw the red-headed siren treading in territory that she'd previously covered in ""Gilda""...an elaborate, nonsensical plot...exotic locations...steamy musical numbers...not to mention the same leading man.

When her husband is murdered, Chris Emery (Rita Hayworth), Trinidad's sultry singing sensation, is asked by the authorities to secretly spy on the chief suspect, influential businessman Max Fabian (Alexander Scourby).  Complicating matters is the arrival of Emery's brother Steve (Glenn Ford), who is attracted to his lovely sister-in-law, and yet repulsed by her intimate relationship with the man clearly responsible for Emery's death.

Comparisons between AFFAIR IN TRINIDAD and the earlier ""Gilda"" aside (""Gilda"" is an undisputed film noir classic) ...TRINIDAD carries it's own unique charms.  In many ways, I actually prefer this movie to ""Gilda""!  It is a very solid noir melodrama, with a softer, more introverted Rita Hayworth.  Co-starring with Glenn Ford for the fourth time, she's absolutely radiant in this film.  Design-wise the film is a real treat, and Hayworth dazzles in Jean Louis fashions.  Director Vincent Sherman (a favourite amongst the Joan Crawford and Bette Davis camps) securely handles the story.  Valerie Bettis chews the scenery in a fun supporting role, and ""Imitation of Life""'s Juanita Moore is Hayworth's mystical housekeeper.

Not a masterpiece by any means.  Just a solid, enjoyable film.  Recommended.",1307923200,4,1527,5.737777777777778
450056,4,6302280206,"Affair in Trinidad was part of the film noir movement of the forties & fifties. It's not the greatest example of that genre but it's still very good. It stars the lovely Rita Hayworth & was her first film in four years. It also stars Glenn Ford who, in just a few more years, would become a box office bonanza. It's directed by the capable Vincent Sherman.

The film opens with an investigation into suicide. The husband (who's never seen) of Chris Emery (Hayworth) is found dead in his boat. It's ruled as a suicide but Inspector Smythe (Torrin Thatcher) doesn't really believe it. He's gotten another statement from one of the local fishermen that leads him to believe otherwise. Smythe & Anderson, the American Ambassador, go to the club where Chris works to inform her of her husband's death. Here we are treated with a performance number by Chris that's a burner. It's interesting to note that all the dance routines were choreographed by Valerie Bettis who portrays Veronica in the film.

Steve Emery (Ford) is introduced on an airplane that's flying to Trinidad. He has a letter from his brother, who he doesn't know is dead, inviting him down for a job as a pilot. Steve meets one of the co=conspirators on the plane, Bronec (Walter Kohler), who has an unusual reaction when Steve asks him does he know his brother.

Apparently, there's some international intrigue going on in Trinidad & Max Fabian (Alexander Scourby) is behind it all. He has a past of doing this sort of thing previously. Inspector Smythe believes it's Fabian behind the death of Chris's husband. He enlists her aid to get the necessary evidence so that he can arrest Fabian. A sham coroner's inquest is held where the death is ruled as a suicide. Steve doesn't believe a word of what he hears about his brother & initiates his own search for the truth. This puts him at odds with Chris & the inspector. Chris & Steve end up in a love-hate relationship that's resolved at the end of the film.

Juanita Moore (Dominique) has an excellent role as Chris's house servant. She seems to intuitively know things about Chris & Steve. It's great to see a decent role for a non-white actress that's more than a caricature this early (1952) in Hollywood's history.

Affair in Trinidad isn't the best example of film noir, maybe it should be viewed more as a spy thriller. It's a very good film & it's always a treat to watch the lovely Hayworth.",1240185600,6,2411,4.6370023419203745

7823862,4,6302280206,"As many have mentioned already, this is no ""Gilda, Part II"", but it does have a fairly good plot and I loved Rita's dancing (especially her ""I've Been Kissed Before"" number)!!!  Rita's costumes were not as good in this movie either.  I think a little more glitz and glamour in her costumes would have helped the movie.  I personally wanted to see her sparkle and shine like a brand new penny.

There was some good suspense in this movie too where I held my breath a little.  When she places her sparkly scarf underneath the books and papers, you just know there will be trouble brewing.  Then later when she tries to sneak out of the house and the hounds from hell start snarling and barking, you know she's trapped.

Bottom line:  You shouldn't pass up this movie just because it is not Gilda Part II.  Rita and Glen do have chemistry and the story line is interesting and suspenseful.  I've watched it four times already and it's growing on me. I'm definitely keeping this movie close at hand for more viewings.",1471824000,,1013,4.516483516483516
