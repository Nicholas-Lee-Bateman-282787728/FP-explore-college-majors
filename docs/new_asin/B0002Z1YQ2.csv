2151043,5,B0002Z1YQ2,"BEWARE, this title is the same story as A New Beginning. If you already have Christy, A New Beginning, DO NOT BUY THIS.",1170115200,88,119,4.217391304347826
2151054,5,B0002Z1YQ2,A great story.  Based on a great series of books.  Did Christy make the right choice?  It is based on a true story of a young woman truly dedicatged to her mission.,1439683200,,164,4.0625
2151055,2,B0002Z1YQ2,"If you order Christy  A New Beginning, it is the same movie. Once again the characters are not the original which is dissapointing.",1438905600,3,131,4.695652173913044
2151056,4,B0002Z1YQ2,Luv all of the Christy Series.,1437004800,,30,4.166666666666667
2151057,3,B0002Z1YQ2,"This is the same storyline as Christy-A New Beginning (which is 89 minutes), but this version Christy-Choices of the Heart is only 60 minutes and misses some high points of the story. I recommend Christy-A New Beginning (which we already have) over this version.",1431734400,2,262,4.9772727272727275

2151063,3,B0002Z1YQ2,"I like the first movies or shows, this actress for Christy just didn't seem right, Kelly Martin did so much better as Christy !!!",1397260800,,129,4.416666666666667
2151074,4,B0002Z1YQ2,"It was true to nature of the book.
The Christy series is a wholesome series that teaches timeless good principles that the world needs today.",1395273600,,141,4.68
2151075,2,B0002Z1YQ2,"I was disappointed to discover that the dvd I purchased did not contain the full movie.  There were whole scenes and sections of dialog missing when you compare it to the version that originally aired on tv.  I am not sure why this version felt the need to shorten it, but it was definitely noticeable for someone who has seen the movie several times like I have.  I feel like this should have been noted in the product description as I wouldn't have purchased it.",1391126400,8,464,4.435294117647059
2151076,3,B0002Z1YQ2,"Only one or two of the original cast in this one, so made it a little disappointing.  At least it's not full of sex & violence.",1385856000,,127,3.8846153846153846
2151077,3,B0002Z1YQ2,"I still prefer Kellie Martin and the other David, Alice, and others but at least it had the same doctor Neal and it lets us know who Christy decided to marry.",1367625600,,158,4.129032258064516
2151078,5,B0002Z1YQ2,"I like Christy series because my kids can watch them with us and the story line is engaging. I'm glad Christy chose ""him"" in the end.",1365724800,,133,4.153846153846154
2151079,5,B0002Z1YQ2,"I have to admit that this book and author is one on my top list for my favorite.  I love her writings of all the series and have her CD's It keeps your interest.  You are immersed in the story line of how the people lived and what they believed.  Showed how they each learned from one another and bonded.  I just can not say how much I really do like this book such a great author.
Great for young and old who like to read.",1348358400,,423,3.883720930232558
2151080,5,B0002Z1YQ2,"The Christy TV series was my favorite program.
Would like to own the complete series.  One program in particular,
was ""Choices of the Heart."" I was so glad to be able to order the
CD from Amazon.

I would like to know if that story is included in the complete
Christy  series? I'm sure I haven't seen all the programs that
were shown on TV.",1319673600,,340,4.2
2151081,5,B0002Z1YQ2,"This is the same movie as the newer version where Christy gets married, called ""A new beginning"". But, there are a few parts that are different in this movie. I really liked this one better. The end of the movie where Christy gets married is the same in both movies.",1281830400,6,266,4.34
2151082,3,B0002Z1YQ2,"Not a great movie, but a must for any Christy fan who needed a bit more of an ending to the abruptly ended series.",1220659200,7,114,3.7916666666666665
2151083,5,B0002Z1YQ2,"Loved this series...it is hard to find wholesome movies to watch.  Have shared with my Christian friends and they are thrilled with them also.  Was a little disappointed that not all of the original actors returned, but this is a must see since the original left you not knowing who Christy married in the end.",1197936000,8,310,4.618181818181818
8035059,2,B0002Z1YQ2,Disappointing and poor acting. Not at all like the series and the characters are not endearing like the TV series. Just pass it up.,1495670400,,131,4.5

8035063,3,B0002Z1YQ2,"It was a nice movie, yet I knew buying it that 90% of the characters would be different from the series. Its hard to watch 19 shows, then the last, most important one doesn't even have the original Christy..
But if u want to know the ending on "" who"" she marries..then get it!!",1469318400,2,277,4.148148148148148

8035065,3,B0002Z1YQ2,This was a duplicate of another of the Christy movies.  I feel like I was cheated because I thought it was a new storyline!,1461283200,,123,4.125
