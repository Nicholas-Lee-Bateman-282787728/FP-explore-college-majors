Great for beginners, and helps clarify everything for those who've never quite ""got"" what they were supposed to be doing (like me!)  I finally understand the importance of HOW I hold my body position and I am working out much more efficiently and feel myself getting stronger.  The pace is slow, so if you are more advanced and already understand what you are doing you may find this tedious.  But if you are easing into exercise I would definitely recommend it.  There are three levels to work at to slowly build yourself up.

I'd developed an unstable pelvis with my pregnancies and learned the hard way that I have to be very careful and choosy with my workouts so that I don't overly strain my pelvic joints (and still strengthen the core muscles.)  I injured myself badly with other workouts.  I finally feel with this video that I can slowly strengthen myself without too much joint strain.  After this video left netflix, I tried another pilates workout on there, and sadly hurt myself again--the pace was too fast, the forms too difficult and too soon for me.

I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a good understanding of the basics or needs to ease gently into exercise.",1337472000,2,1279,4.644444444444445

8166228,5,B000M4RG2E,"Physicians are often asked for guidance on appropriate resources for an exercise program.  Fortunately, we now have Lindsay Jackson's Pilates Essentials"" and I feel the DVD met the test for professionalism and accurate depiction of strength building exercise routines.

This is truly a ""must see"" resource for body conditioning.  We plan to introduce the DVD to our hospital's educational program.  Well done indeed!",1187913600,6,416,5.555555555555555
