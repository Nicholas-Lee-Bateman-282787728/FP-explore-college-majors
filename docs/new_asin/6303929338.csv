728177,5,6303929338,"This package film from 1977 contains three ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts from the late sixties and early seventies, with a little connecting tissue and an unexpectedly poignant ending thrown in for good measure.  The result is surprisingly cohesive, and, as an adaptation of A.A. Milne's stories, impossible to top.
Dorothy Parker reviewed one of the original _Pooh_ books with the tart phrase ""Tonstant weader fwowed up,"" and anyone who has read Milne knows that he can easily descend into cutesy overkill.  But the Disney film wisely avoids this problem by playing every scene for whimsy and understatement.  It's an unusually delicate mood for a Disney animated feature, and it works much better on television than in a movie theater.
The film emphasizes its storybook origins by foregrounding the printed text (especially during the middle ""Blustery Day"" segments).  Characters and backgrounds bear an astonishingly close resemblance to Ernest Shepard's original watercolor-and-ink illustrations.  Voice talent matches the characters flawlessly, though the voice and design of Christopher Robin are noticeably different in each segment -- a testimony to the film's piecemeal production over nearly a decade.
The DVD transfer contains noticeable flicker and grain but relatively few specks and scratches.  Extras are plentiful, including songs and educational games for children, as well as a documentary and art gallery for the grown-ups.  As a less desirable extra, the DVD also includes the lamentable 1983 theatrical short ""Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore,"" which, unlike the feature film, gets the atmosphere perfectly wrong.

728178,5,6303929338,"Finally ,this wonderful video is being re-released!
Our family has worn out the special anniversary edition of this movie classic that has been unavailable for years. The pictures and sound are excellent and of much better quality than the shorter VHS tapes that include segments of this full length movie. The  movie version is divided into chapters that invite both short or long viewing periods. The simple problems that face the animated characters are resolved with humor and without violence. Toddlers enjoy watching the simple stories over and over again, as they learn the plot and anticipate what will happen next. Youngsters who are learning to talk, will say what is going to happen next and often say the characters lines before the character does. Problems in the story are resolved in ways that are satisfying to little ones.
There are very few excellent videos available for the tiniest children that are also pleasurable for adults to watch with their children.
Our family takes this one video everywhere we travel for guaranteed fun and quiet time with our youngest child.
I look forward to buying the VHS tape for our family and to give as gifts to our favorite toddlers.",1007510400,11,1189,4.945

728183,4,6303929338,"Like that other cuddly British import, James Bond, Winnie The Pooh grew (diminished?) from literary figure to film icon to corporate symbol. Each new feature starring either has dumbed down character and plot to  cariacture; in Bond's case, gadgetry and double entendre, in Pooh's,  platitudes about family and friendship (Not that A.A. Milne, Pooh's  creator, opposed these bedrock concepts, he chose more creative, knotty  ways to express them in his narratives.)
It helps to remember the basics.  In Pooh's case, that means Milne's books and this film, which gently  introduces Pooh and his friends Owl, Rabbit, Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger and  Christopher Robin. It does so while adhering to the books' narrative tone  (helped by narrarator Sebastian Cabot). The songs, voices (particularly  Paul Winchell and the late Sterling Holloway as Pooh), backgrounds, and  characterizations would never be closer to Milne's (or for that matter,  Walt Disney's) original vision. The Pooh TV series tried weekly to capture  the wistfulness of the book's and film's final moments where Christopher  Robin goes to school and leaves the Hundred Acre Wood. Here, it's done with  minimal sentimentality while capturing loss of preschool imagination and  happy isolation children face. This video is essential for anyone owning  anything with Pooh's picture on it. This movie, and book it stems from, are  why so many love Winnie The Pooh.",955670400,23,1422,5.361990950226244

Get the Blu-ray full version if you want to truly step back to your childhood and have that full theater experience.
Disney paved the way and set the standard for theater scale animated storytelling and this collection will serve to inspire and excite your children and grandchildren.

74 Minutes of hand rendered and illustrated backgrounds, with hand sketched and colored animated cells... frame by fabulous frame... you don't see that anymore. You'll appreciate the art behind this film when you realize the backgrounds are watercolor illustrations, the characters are sketched by animators, and later copied and hand painted with custom colors. It's more than a simple cartoon.

Narrated by Sabastian Cabot (well remembered as Mr. French)

And that highly recognizable Winnie the Pooh voice - by Sterling Holloway

Real animation, faithfully reproduced and presented in 1080p 16 x 9 High Definition.

Break out the popcorn, take your seats, kill the lights and experience Winnie the Pooh with this FABULOUS Blu-ray Disc.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE MANY ADVENTURES OF WINNIE THE POOH [1977] is a Walt Disney Studios animated musical comedy feature-length film was originally released by Buena Vista Distribution and first released on 11th March, 1977. It is the 22nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Studios. It is based upon the classic children's stories about the beloved bear written by A. A. Milne, and as well as the final chapter of the second treasured story, The House at Pooh Corner. The animated film THE MANY ADVENTURES OF WINNIE THE POOH is actually composed of material from three previously released animated shorts:

WINNIE THE POOH AND THE HONEY TREE [1966] Winnie the Pooh, the honey loving silly old bear attempts to get honey from a bee tree, so after climbing the tree didn't work, he borrows Christopher Robin's balloon, dunks himself in mud and floats to the top of the honey tree incognito as a little black rain cloud. After escaping the angry bees, Pooh decides to get honey the old fashion way: getting some from Rabbit, so after stuffing his face with all of Rabbit's honey, Pooh attempts to climb out Rabbit's front door, but becomes stuck! No matter how hard everyone tries, they can't get him out, so they wait for Pooh to lose weight before they can get him out. Then along comes Gopher who agrees to help get Pooh out and almost feeds him more honey! But then one morning, Pooh is finally freed from the doorway and ends up in another sticky situation-quite literally! Voice Cast: Sebastian Cabot [Narrator], Sterling Holloway [Winnie the Pooh], Junius C. Matthews [Rabbit], Hal Smith [Owl], Howard Morris [Gopher], Clint Howard [Roo], Barbara Luddy [Kanga], Bruce Reitherman [Christopher Robin] and Ralph Wright [Eeyore].

WINNIE THE POOH AND THE BLUSTERY DAY [1968] Pooh is back and this time he's gonna blow you away. Almost literally. When Pooh's friend Gopher warns him that it's Windsday, Pooh goes off to wish Piglet a Happy Windsday, but Piglet is lifted into the air by the strong winds, Pooh grabs Piglet's scarf, which unravels into a single string, and looks to be flying Piglet like a kite. They arrive at Owl's house, the wind blows it down and Owl inquires as to whether Pooh did it. Eeyore agrees to find a new house for Owl, but one night, Pooh gets a visit from an unusual new friend  Tigger, a rambunctious tiger who likes honey but hates it just the same, and warns Pooh about Heffalumps and Woozles, who steal honey. But Heffalumps and Woozles are only half of Pooh's worries now, for a huge rain storm has set on the Hundred Acre Wood. Everybody is swimming in their homes. Pooh inadvertently saves Piglet from a waterfall so they have a hero party. Eeyore then barges in and announces he has found a new home for Owl; unfortunately the house he found was Piglet's. But Piglet does a heroic thing and turns over his domicile to Owl, so they have a Two Hero Party and the storm dies down. At least until next Windsday. Voice Cast: Sebastian Cabot [Narrator], Sterling Holloway [Winnie the Pooh], John Fiedler [Piglet], Jon Walmsley [Christopher Robin], Hal Smith [Owl], Ralph Wright [Eeyore], Junius C. Matthews [Rabbit], Howard Morris [Gopher], Barbara Luddy [Kanga], Clint Howard [Roo] and Paul Winchell [Tigger].

WINNIE THE POOH AND TIGGER TOO [1974] Rabbit is tired of Tigger always bouncing him, so he gets Pooh and Piglet together to come up with an idea to get the bounce out of Tigger. Rabbit suggests they take him into the middle of nowhere and leave him overnight. The idea backfires and Rabbit, Piglet and Pooh find themselves lost, but Pooh's tummy guides them home. Then, Tigger and Roo go out for a bounce and get caught in a tree, which Tigger is too afraid to get out of, and Rabbit makes Tigger promise that if they help get Tigger down, that Tigger can never bounce again. So Tigger is rescued and feels sad that he can no longer bounce, but everyone, including Rabbit, agrees they liked the old bouncy Tigger better. Voice Cast: Sebastian Cabot [Narrator], Dori Whitaker [Roo], Paul Winchell [Tigger], Sterling Holloway [Winnie the Pooh], John Fiedler [Piglet], Junius Matthews [Rabbit], Barbara Luddy [Kanga] and Timothy Turner [Christopher Robin].

A fourth, shorter feature was added to bring the animated film to a close. The sequence was based on the final chapter of The House at Pooh Corner, where Christopher Robin has to leave the Hundred Acre Wood behind as he is starting school. In it, Christopher Robin  and Pooh discuss what they liked doing together and he asks Pooh to promise to remember him and to keep some of the memories of their time together alive. Pooh agrees, and the animated film closes with The Narrator Sebastian Cabot, saying that wherever Christopher Robin goes, Pooh will always be waiting for him whenever he returns.

The three animated film's content comes largely from the three previously released animated features that Disney produced based upon the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree [1966], Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day [1968], and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! [1974]. Extra material used to link the three features together was added to allow the stories to flow into each other.

The animated film also inspired an attraction of the same name at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World. A much more elaborate attraction, also based on the film, opened in Tokyo Disneyland as ""Pooh's Hunny Hunt.""

Blu-ray Video Quality  Once again the Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has brought us this glorious Blu-ray disc in a stunning 1080p Technicolor image presentation, which is helped by the very nice 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The animated colours are totally rich and very vibrant and because they are dynamic, make it look as though you could freeze frame almost any of the images of the animated film and have yourself a painting worthy of being framed. In the live action shots of the stuffed animals in Christopher Robins bedroom the fur on the animals look so warm, rich and positively huggable! This 2015 Blu-ray upgrade release of this Disney animated film looks totally amazing and matches the old original films look and style perfectly.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has given us a totally excellent and unique 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix. The dialogue is very clear and consistent throughout the animated film. The soundtrack is lightly front speaker oriented, but I did notice some stomping across all of the channels. Tiggers endless bouncing also shows off the excellent directional effects of this mix too. But Buddy Bakers composed music sounds wonderful and is well balanced with the rest of the animated film. It is never overwhelmed by the music or the films sound effects

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

SNEAK PEAKS: DISNEY NATURE: Chimpanzee [2012] [1080p] [1.78:1]; PLANES [2013] [1080p] [1.78:1]; Disney Junior: Sofia the First [1080p] [1.78:1] and Tinker Bell [Movie] [1080p] [1.78:1]

Finally, as a massive long-time fan of the silly ol Winnie The Pooh bear, but of course I am extremely happy to see him and his friends return in such a wonderful Disney animated film. THE MANY ADVENTURES OF WINNIE THE POOH is hilariously funny, charming, and children of all ages will especially love this animated film forever and will be especially loved by the whole family who will enjoy every magical moment. I also feel this classic Disney animated film is as always a true masterpiece that has been achieved, especially with this old style hand drawn animated film that Disney always excels with this original 1977 release of a style of cartoon I have always loved and enjoyed, so I hope you will to, especially if you are a massive Disney fan like me. Highly Recommended!

729469,4,6303929338,"Just to be clear, I own the Blu-ray with the words Original Classic on the box with pooh holding a kite, Tigger also holding it, Roo holding Tigger's tail and Eeyore in the background.  I've seen reviews mentioning missing shows.  Thie one I have has all the shows including a Day for Eeyore.  They just aren't hi-def.  Only the main movie is.  But they are all on the blu ray disk.

I gave it 4 stars because the aspect ratio is misleading.  The main movie is not 1:33x1.  It is closer to normal blu ray of 16x9.  I have the original DVD version and I compared them.  The differences are very small, but I wanted the movie to be the correct aspect ratio.  As for a difference, an example is the scene when Pooh overeats at Rabbit's and gets stuck in the door.  After Rabbit attempts to push him out, the movie shows Pooh.  Over his head is a sign that says Rabbit's Howse.  Both words appear fully in the old DVD, but in the blu ray, the word Rabbit's is almost fully cut off (vertically).

Not a big deal and does not take away from the movie and most people would not notice.  But if the aspect ratio is listed, it should be accurate, so I downgraded to 4 stars.  Otherwise, fantastic movie and great quality.",1489536000,,1212,4.2687224669603525

729782,5,6303929338,A classic!,1485129600,,10,4.5
729783,5,6303929338,"We actually only purchased this after Netflix removed it and have just used the DVD. I know others ran into problems with the digital copy, but even for the price of simply the DVD it was well worth the price.",1484956800,,209,4.25
729784,5,6303929338,"In the Hundred Acre Woods, a stuffed bear named Winnie the Pooh goes on cute adventures with his many animal friends and his human master Christopher Robin. Whether Pooh-Bear wants some honey to eat or is trying to find shelter from a windstorm or a flood, he always brings his childlike charm and nave thinking to every event in the story. His equally cute and cuddly friends are the depressed donkey Eeyore, the energetic and bouncy Tigger, the green-thumbed Rabbit, the delightfully wise Owl, the tiny stuttering Piglet, the hardworking constructor Gopher, and the flower-loving Kanga and Roo. Children of all ages can bask in their innocence at these cuddly mini-stories and grow up to be loving adults.

I cannot emphasize enough how insanely cute this movie is except for by giving it an extra credit grade. Whenever I watch Pooh-Bear eat honey, play with his friends, or just be his silly self, it makes me want to cuddle with stuffed or real animals of my own. Tiggers hyperactivity, mitten-like paws, and joyful singing also make me want to cuddle with animal cuties. There isn't one character in this movie who doesnt warm my insides like a freshly baked apple pie (with honey drizzled on it, of course). Even the bees that swarm on Pooh for trying to steal their honey have their cute moments, particularly with their character designs and high-pitched voices. And who could forget all the laugh-inducing times when Gopher fell into his hole in the groundover and over again. This kind of cuteness overload will set the tone for children later in life when they have kids of their own or adopt pets. Love is a universal language that can be taught with movies like Winnie the Pooh.

Another thing Ill always enjoy about this movie is Sterling Holloways vocal performance as Pooh-Bear. He was always known for having a nasally rasp voice with a hint of baritone. Mr. Holloway has used this same voice to play characters like Amos Mouse in Ben and Me and Hiss from Robin Hood, two Disney classics. Hearing this sweet and innocent voice makes me glad that Holloways successor, Jim Cummings, decided to keep the tradition going when playing Winnie the Pooh in future movies. It even warms my heart to know that Mr. Cummings uses his Pooh voice to comfort sick children in hospitals. Is this another example of how the movie can teach love and friendship at such a young age? Why, Id like to think so! Of course, Sterling Holloway isn't with us anymore, but his contributions to the Disney universe will never be forgotten.

Just like with all good things, this movie must eventually come to an end at the 74 minute mark. How does one wrap up a series of short stories known for bringing happy emotions to an entire generation? By having Christopher Robin grow up, of course. While only a year has passed since the events of the movie, little Christopher eventually has to go to school and get good grades. Not all children end up having fond memories of school, whether its because of difficult assignments, harsh teachers, or bully students. The movie put us all at ease with the conversation Christopher had with Pooh-Bear. They talked about growing old together and always being friends no matter what life throws at them. One way or another, Christopher Robin will never forget where he came from and will always come back to the Hundred Acre Woodseven when hes a hundred years old and moving around on a walker. How old will Pooh be? Ninety-nine. Silly old bear!

Let this be a lesson to all of the adults reading this review: never forget the love you experienced as a child and always take those positive memories into the future with you. Even if you grew up with harsher circumstances, know that someone out there loves and cares for you. Someone out there will be your Pooh-Bear. If you have to go to the Humane Society for a basket of Pooh-Bears known as kittens, what are you waiting for? Youre never too old to acknowledge cuteness when you see it. Age-consciousness is for suckers.",1484956800,,4002,4.721030042918455

Not long, but if it's new it should work completely. Everything else played fine. However, the quality on A Day for Eeyore is terrible. Very grainy and unclean. Even my old VHS looked better than this. They did a good job restoring the main feature but they need to clean up and restore a Day for Eeyore. Other than that, it's good.

731448,3,6303929338,"A good disney classic movie, beloved to all who have watched the movie. The video and audio quality is good but not fantastic in my opinion.
Bonus features include:-
1. Pooh play along - A fun way to exercise like Pooh, march like Christopher Robin and bounce like Tigger (for kids)
2. Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh - 5 shorts that are experts from Piglet's Big Movie and Winnie the Pooh (2011)
3. A day for Eyore - A 25 minute extended short film
4. Classic DVD Bonus features (SD quality) - Making of the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh & Music Video by Carly Simon
All in all, I'll rate the movie 3 stars, the video and audio quality 4 stars and the bonus features 2 stars.",1433894400,,684,4.269230769230769
731449,5,6303929338,"I bought the blu-ray because the description more closely matched the classic, 1970s version of the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and I had heard rumor of people not being able to find it. This is it: the Classic Pooh that I grew up with. Now my son gets to watch it too. I sang along to every song the first time through. Brought back lots of memories.

The digital copy redemption didn't work for me, which is a bummer, but I didn't really get it for that. The bonus features aren't so great: the shorts are more like newer, less appealing Pooh shows, and not like the classic. But again, I wanted the original movie, so I'm very happy.",1433808000,2,644,4.322314049586777

731516,5,6303929338,"This is an all time classic.  A must have ,nobody does Pooh Bear like Sterling Holloway, and of course Sebastian Cabot as the narrator makes it even more special.  Pooh Bear is unabashedly self centered...not too many people can pull that off, I suppose you have to be a stuffed bear to get away with it.  I am 59 years old, my wife and I played this for our two boys a hundred times on the VCR (remember those things) and we never tired of it. I watched it for the first time in 25 years and it is amazing how A.A. Milne captured the innocence and pure joy of childhood.  It would be my wish that every child sometime in their lives would have the opportunity to live such a perfectly wonderful childhood as Christopher Robin.

We also have the newer Pooh movie,  Having watched both quite a few times recently - the one subtle difference I noticed is the cadence of the dialogue.  This story is told just a little bit slower.  It seems to be more relaxed.  My son (6 years old) articulated that there are not upset times in this movie.  The characters are never really scared of anything.  As cute as the new Pooh movie is, the characters spend a lot of time being afraid of a ""Backson"".  There's isn't a similar fear in this one.  They face some conflicts, but they face them without the fear.",1428969600,,668,4.314516129032258

731655,2,6303929338,"Not a fan.  Probably my fault for not knowing the Milne story, but this is awful for my daughter.  I thought it would be a lot of singing and dancing and happy playing. Not so much.  In the few half hour or so that we've watched, Pooh was swarmed by a bunch of angry bees, and then Owl's tree house blew over and was destroyed in a storm; subsequently, Pooh was scared while trying to sleep during a rainy windy night and heard strange noises and knocks at his door in the middle of the night (turned out to be Tigger), after which he (and Piglet) were flooded out of their homes and floated down a fast current and over a waterfall.  All survived and are fine of course, but scary for my 4-year-old.  And it turns out that the characters are kind of awful: Pooh is as dumb as a load of bricks, Eeyore is a depressive pessimist, Owl is a full-of-himself windbag, Tigger apparently has ADHD (and badly).....neither me nor my daughter are enjoying this very much. Just a warning for others whose children may be sensitive to scary things...",1426377600,,1038,4.385416666666667

As with most classic children's literature, Disney did more than his usual tampering with the story and the artwork (in this case, adding a character that was never in the books, Howard Morris voicing the character Gopher).  Disney was known for taking undue liberties with great fiction, it's his legacy.

E.H. Shepard's illustrations are sublime; in Disney's version, the characters are entirely sanitized into roly-poly unreasonable approximations of the originals (or as one of the animators put it, ""We had to make them Disney"").  This was probably done with an eye to future theme park rides and products.  With Disney, it was never about the art.  At this point, people have forgotten what the real characters were all about.  Its one thing to be forgotten, quite another to be supplanted by an inferior creation pretending to be the same.

At worse, these are cute representations of better work, entertaining in their own right, but not as good as the source material.  Watching this conglomerate cartoon makes me pine for another reading of the A.A. Milne's fabulous books.",1417478400,,1289,4.903225806451613

I read many lengthy reviews to make sure that all 4 videos were included - 'just like the Anniversary Edition' which costs more but was released quite a few years earlier.

I was very happy until I watched the cd and realized that there were not 4 adventures as the description and reviews claimed.

I would like my money back actually and I think you really need to get the correct information attached to the correct cd offerings.

So when my son was finally old enough to watch a movie, I was super excited to put this on for him, and by and large I was not disappointed. That is until my husband sat through it and started pointing out all the things one doesn't notice as a child. Every single character is a narcissist, except maybe Kanga and Piglet. Pooh just invites himself wherever and is proud of eating everyone's food; Tigger is kind of a menace... It's not worth going on. I don't think any of this is a problem for a two-year old; they're definitely narcissists too. And given that 95% of the children's tv being made right now is completely devoid of any conflict or anything less than total selflessness, it probably balances out.",1387929600,,814,4.3618421052631575

733097,4,6303929338,"Disney Studios 22nd full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh is one of the better know and most beloved entries into the Disney animated film cannon with unforgettable characters and one of the rare occasions where the new Xerography process suits the material. The Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.

While this film doesn't compare to the early classics, it is one of their most memorable for this time period, although this is actually three short segments sewn together and feels more like a TV program, it still deserves it's classic status. The story book backdrop lends perfectly to the animation style and the animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone and some others from this time period between 1961-1981.

The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed tend to come across like their unpolished, but this is really not the case with this film, Jungle Book and 101 Dalmatians. Because Disney ended the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the new Blu Ray and all have their good points and bad points. the first release was released in full screen and the second in 1:75:1 and the new Blu Ray is 1:66:1 which seems to work well as the film doesn't appeared cramped. It would be nice if Disney would include multiple formats on the newer releases as the extras are thin and there is room for them. It would also let buyers have more options for playback. The restoration looks impressive, but because of the style of animation and the Xerography process the rough lines seem a little too rough for my taste in some areas. I prefer the earlier films over the films from 1961-1981. These films seem to be missing some of Walt's magic, although these segments were created while Walt was alive, he died before they became the classics he predicted. The story of Pooh was loved and known a long time before Disney gave us their version and it is a credit to them that they have given us the definitive version that comes to everyone's mind when the character is mentioned.

While the Blu Ray looks great, I thought the 25th anniversary DVD looked great too, the addition of some pretty lack luster extras on the Blu Ray isn't enough to push to buy this, but if you want to own The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, then the Blu Ray is the way to go, but I'll keep my DVD for the full screen aspect ratio.",1384300800,3,2927,4.580152671755725

Since we had rented a big meeting  room as a local hotel (so the kids could swim in the hotel pool) we took our 10 foot screen and showed this to the younger kids. It was a big hit.

Picture was as good as it gets and sound had been burnished as well.

This arrived on the release date but I held it back so I would be able to give it to her once she had settled in (she's a senior chemistry major - she just applied to several med schools last week so we have our fingers crossed!). The price was very competitive.

733332,1,6303929338,"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is a beloved childhood film and the Blu-ray transfer is quite gorgeous and a delight. If I were reviewing the Blu-ray alone I would give it 5 stars. Unfortunately in the context of this combo pack which includes a ""Digital Copy"" I am giving this release 1 star.

If you're considering this combo product, then like me, you probably want the best of all worlds; namely Blu-ray quality for home theater viewing, DVD for legacy devices and laptops, and Digital Copy for devices and digital media streaming.

This release delivers two out of the three. The lack of iTunes support was heavily disappointing and forced me to return the title. I have Apple desktops, laptops, tablets, and an Apple TV at home. For those reasons Apple iTunes is my sole digital content provider in regards to purchased digital copies of movies and television shows.

Also the format and presentation via iTunes is very kid friendly on iOS devices. Vudu and Amazon seems convoluted and the fact that each time I want to watch the film, it needs to stream each time. I'm sorry but that does not count as a ""Digital Copy""

For those reasons above I give this release 1 star. The reality is, we'll only watch the Blu-ray a handful of times, the DVD is just a backup. 99% of the time my daughter will be watching her favorite films on an iPad or Apple TV.

Disney's strategy of making some Digital Copies releases iTunes redeemable and others not is very sporadic, haphazard and ultimately disappointing.",1380758400,5,1513,4.694339622641509

I compared the title sequence where the toy Pooh bear sat on the bookshelf with books to the right and various toys and ornaments on the shelf above, as the DVD shows in 1.37:1. But on the Blu-ray in the newly invented 1.66:1 ratio, the detail of the shelves above where the bear is are hardly visible! They have been cropped out! Next I compared the scene where Pooh bear did his stretching exercises in the mirror with a cuckoo clock on the wall above him to the right.

Our daughter Liz LOVES Winnie the Pooh and has grew up watching it through the years.  One of her favorite toys when she was little was a Winnie the Pooh that talked and that was one of first things she remembered when we watched this awesome classic Disney movie. She of course wanted to watch this one with us, and we were thrilled to be spending quality family time together which is one of the great things about Disney movies.

No matter your age when watching that silly old bear you can't help but smile at the trials and tribulations they all go through. It is now available on Blu-Ray + DVD and includes some amazing bonus features.  Some of the features includes a fun Disney intermission with fun family games and activities.  My younger nieces and nephews especially loved that part because it was if the characters were inviting you personally to do things with them.  What's not to love about that?

The film still looks like it was the older version of Winnie The Pooh many of us grew up watching, but it has been digitized which makes it even better.  The shorts are amazing stories individually but blend together very nicely to tell the whole story of events that take place in the Hundred Acre Woods.  My favorite is of course the shorts that show Pooh's love of honey.  Then the big finish when he runs out and gets stuck in Rabbit's hole after eating to much honey.  It is a true classic that shows how teamwork can get you out of sticky situations.

If you don't own a copy of The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh I would strongly suggest picking up a copy at your local store or online.  It is a great movie to add to your collection or your child(rens) collection to enjoy for years to come.",1379980800,,1833,4.403560830860534

Well, the real ""pooh"" is that you're SOL if you're a Mac and/or iOS user as this is not a true digital download from iTunes, you have to get the video through Amazon Instant Video or Vudu. As I never have used either, I opted for Amazon as I'm a loyal customer and know nothing about Vudu. What a bad choice. Not only is it not a true digital download, but you have to go through the Amazon or Vudu app. Amazon Instant Video only works on iPad, so forget about playing this on your iPhone. To make it even worse, you can only play it in standard definition on your iPad or Mac.

I understand that Amazon and Apple are fighting for digital content and tablet supremacy, but DISNEY customers shouldn't be caught in the middle. DISNEY should have provided iTunes as an option to make it a true bundle as the digital copy was an influence in this purchase.

While Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, Kanga, Roo and Owl get 5 stars, Disney and its concept of digital copy (and not being more explicit in the product description) gets 0 stars. I hope that this doesn't happen with my Iron Man 3 pre-order, because if it does I am done buying Disney Blu-rays that include ""digital copy"" unless it is supported on my Mac and iTunes so I can watch it on my iPhone.",1378944000,10,1507,4.318021201413427

What a rip-off for Winnie the Pooh fans!  On the box it states ""Digital Copy"", but inside you find out it's a digital streaming service with either Amazon Instant Video or Vudu.  A ""digital copy"" should be downloadable onto pc, smartphone, etc...but instead, you need an internet connection to watch the digital copy.

The transfer to blu-ray is stunning in some places and exceptionally disappointing elsewhere.  Personally I expected better from Disney.  The opening credits and the text in the book are often over processed to the point of being muddy.  Motion artifacts happen often enough that they are almost distracting.  A classic like this deserved the highest attention as it is truly one of a kind that transcends generations.

In other words, despite years of very customer - friendly compatibility with iTunes, this release - like the other titles mentioned - only provides access to a ""Digital Copy"" via Vudu and Amazon.  There is NO iTunes support being offered and, like with the other releases, there is no mention of this shift on the packaging or anywhere online - you only find out once you've entered your redemption code.  This means, no support for those of us who have built up significant libraries for use via Apple TV or for anyone outside of the U.S.

As a loyal Disney customer who has been building a legitimate library of Digital files for the past five years or so, this switch to exclude iTunes - after years of excellent support - is troubling to me.  With the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oz-the-Great-and-Powerful/dp/B00C5W3SBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oz the Great and Powerful</a>, I had great hope for the future of how Digital Copy releases were going - disc free and broad compatibility across platforms and programs.  However, this batch of releases tells me that Disney is looking to experiment with us to see what we'll put up with.  I - for one - have no interest in switching to a new service, creating new accounts, etc.  After feeling burned by these four pre-ordered releases, future Disney releases will no longer be ""blind buys"" for me, unless I know in advance that I can fully use the product without altering my already well-established setup and habits.

Again, I am posting this so that potential buyers can be aware of this change, if it matters to them, to assist in making an informed decision.",1376524800,28,2345,6.103343465045593

My rating reflects the quality of the transfer and the bonus features of the Blu-ray. If I were to rate the DVD alone, it would be one-star.

NOTE: Amazon currently does not separate reviews for films based on format, so if you find this review at all informative, for the love of Pooh sticks, VOTE IT AS HELPFUL. This will tell Amazon that this Blu-ray review is more relevant to today's buyers than those others complaining that their 1981 laserdisc is in Pan-and-Scan.

Now to some specifics.

PACKAGING:

Standard double-disc Blu-ray container with ""collectable"" slipcase. Disney doesn't like disc art, for some reason, and these discs have nothing but the title on them. Also included are: an insert with a code to redeem both your Disney Movie Reward points and to stream a Digital Copy; an ad for Disney Movie Club; and.... a free kite! It's kind of a cheap paper Tigger kite, but I still thought this was a really cool extra, despite the fact that I'm nearly 30 and will never actually fly this. Disney is pretty stingy on physical extras (and digital extras, as you're about to find out), and it was a surprise to find this on a non-Diamond release.

BLU-RAY:

The disc opens with previews for The Little Mermaid Blu-ray, Disney Junior, Planes, and... well, I skipped to the main menu at that point. Who watches these?

MENU:

Cute animation of Pooh characters hopping or flying in the background. Pretty straightforward options of Play Movie, Bonus Features, Setup. If you turn off your player and start it back up, you can resume playback to your location in the film... after going through the ads and the main menu again.

SETUP OPTIONS:

Languages: English 5.1 Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, English 2.0 Dolby Digital, French 5.1 Dolby Digital, and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital
Subtitles: None, English for the Hearing Impaired, English, French, and Spanish
Disney Intermission: On by default, Disney Intermission will play two minutes of guessing games whenever the feature film is paused. Kind of neat, but with only three games (geared toward toddlers) that repeat on a loop, it's not really the ""groundbreaking"" special feature that Disney claims.

MAIN FEATURE:

Opens in 1:75:1 aspect ratio with the original Buena Vista logo. (Amazon lists this as 1:33:1, or full screen, but it is not. It is the original theatrical widescreen.) The movie looks BETTER THAN EVER with super-crisp visuals throughout, with bright and colorful animation, and clean projection that was obviously cleaned up and restored, but not scrubbed of all its original qualities. There is still texture to be seen on the background art, and the film retains the ""sketchy"" look of the era's animation. (For those who care, I watched this movie on a 2013 Samsung 60'' LED 3D TV with a 2013 Samsung 3D Blu-ray player.) Disney may shaft its fans every now and again with video releases, but they've been consistently top-notch with their Blu-ray transfers. This is no exception. Worth an upgrade in itself.

BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES:

New Features:

Pooh Play-Along (HD): Recycled animation inviting kids to stretch, bounce, and march along with Pooh and friends. (1:48)

Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (HD): Four clips from ""Piglet's Big Movie"" and one from ""Winnie the Pooh"" (2011) reedited into a storybook fashion. Each one is slightly over 2 minutes long, making this roughly ten or eleven minutes total.

Classic DVD Bonus Features:

""A Day for Eeyore"" (SD and unrestored): It's grainy and speckled with dust throughout, and not to the standards of the main feature. Disappointing, as this is the most valuable special feature you get. (25:23)
The Story Behind the Masterpiece (SD, 25:02): A making-of featurette with light interviews but nothing noteworthy. You'd learn more on the Wikipedia page.
""The Winnie the Pooh Theme Song"" Performed by Carly Simon (SD): What it sounds like. Carly Simon sings with clips from the film in a retro 4:3 aspect ratio. Would have been more fun if this section was called ""Pooh's So Vain He Probably Thinks This Song Is About Him.""

Also Included:

""Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go,"" a one-minute advertisement for the Disney Digital Copy, and ""Info,"" a legal disclaimer. Disney sometimes claims these as bonus features, although I doubt even they can say this with a straight face. Last but not least, there's also a way to watch even more commercials of upcoming films.

DVD CONTENTS:

The DVD continues the recent tradition of Disney screwing over people with DVD-only households. You get the main feature (they have to give you that), but only two bonus features: only one (!) of the Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (which is ""Geniuses,"" if you care, which you don't), and a single ""Classic DVD Bonus Feature"": the useless Carly Simon music video. It's kind of a slap in the face to DVD owners to not include ""A Day for Eeyore"" on this disc, and to leave out the ""Classic DVD Features"" which were INTENDED FOR DVD EDITIONS. It's not like the original DVD they recycled these from was a multi-disk set; it was one disc. This means when Disney re-mastered the DVD for this set, they CHOSE to hold back these features in an attempt to strong-arm people into buying Blu-ray players. Inexcusable, Disney.

DIGITAL COPY:

This edition does not include a physical disc, just a code to stream the film on Vudu or Amazon Instant Video. For the purpose of this review, I claimed my copy on Amazon, only to discover that despite ordering the HD version, only the SD would play back on my computer. I also learned that the press release for this set was INCORRECT: it claimed ""Digital owners receive all of the same bonus features as the Blu-ray except for Disney Intermission."" THIS IS FALSE. You will NOT receive ANY bonus features from your digital edition.

OVERALL:

I love this movie and it looks incredible on Blu-ray. If you have a Blu-ray player and an HD television, this is a must-buy upgrade. Five stars for the transfer. Bonus features could be better, but this is probably the final release in physical media this title will see, so I advise you pick it up while you can.

However, if you are buying this for the DVD only and can't play Blu-ray, you should look for a copy of the Friendship Edition DVD instead (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Many-Adventures-of-Winnie-the-Pooh-The-Friendship-Edition/dp/B000OLGCF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (The Friendship Edition)</a>). Amazon's product description currently displays that the new August 27, 2013 DVD contains all the special features of the old edition, but I seriously think this a mistake. From my experience, the DVD releases match the disc inside the Blu-ray combos. I don't think it even comes with the kite. If you're DVD only, buy the Friendship Edition.",1375488000,17,7546,5.093192868719611

I have two concerns about the video, especially for the youngest viewers.  The first concerns the part of the story where Pooh eats Rabbit out of honey and then gets stuck in the entrance to the rabbit hole.  I thought it charming but my wife pointed out that, in 2013, that story line is mildly oppressive of people with weight problems.  Nobody would have thought of that in 1966.  2013 is a different matter.

Second, Pooh's dream sequence (heffalumps and woozels) could be genuinely frightening to a very young viewer (under 3 yrs old); the music and images combine to create a mildly sinister mood, perfectly OK for 7 yr olds, but maybe not for toddlers.

733995,5,6303929338,"Who doesn't love Winnie the Pooh. Heck, he's like on of he most innocent things on the planet. I think there's a law actually forbidding people not ot like him. I know poeple who despise Mickey Mouse, but they can't bring themselves to say they hate Winnie the Pooh. So what is it? What is it that just makes him so likeable? Well, I think alot of it has to do with, while he's very optomistic, he makes alot of mistakes and he does get in trouble. He's naive, but he's also very pleasent, and I think that makes him much more interesting then someone like Mickey Mouse. He's still positive, but there's much more of a character to play with. And it all started with this one film, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

These characters are so famous now I don't even have to name them: Kanga, Roo, Tiger, Owl, Rabbit, Piglet, Eeyore, the list goes on. The story is very loose, in that there's not much of a flowing narrative. It's just the life of Pooh and his friends over the course of a year, maybe. It's juast all the troubles, circumstances, and weird situations they get into, and how they manage to live or get around it.

As a kid I liked it fine. But now watching it as a adult, actually it's alot better than I remember it. They actually make alot of fourth wall jokes about the book they're in and even talk about the narrator.

But that's not the only reason it's good. There's just this sense to it, this atmosphere, this real likeability to this world they created. It's very laid-back. It's very slow-paced, but at the same time these characters are just so interesting and so nice that you enjoy spending time with them. You don't care that not alot is going on. You could just have a conversation with any one of these people and be ver satisfied. I really like movies like that, that don't think they have to stick to the three-act structure. They just let characters berthe and do whatever they do.

And these characters are really enjoyable and the situations they get into are really enjoyable. We get some really creative scenarios with the windstorm, Pooh trying to get more honey, and, of course, a trippy-as-hell Disney scence with Heffalumps and Woozles.

The songs are very clever, the animation actually matches the mood and stlye they're goining for, and, like I said, just a really heavy atmosphere to it.

I especially like the ending. There's no big climax, no chase scene, no major discoveries. It's just Christopher Robin talking to his imaginary friend about the inevetability of the future. That's actually kind of heavy stuff.

Winnie the Pooh is not often looked at as one of the great Disney films, but it is looked at as one of the great Disney characters, and that's all the film is, just enjoying this cahracter and all the people around him. It's clever. It's nice. It's friendly. I really enjoyed  watching it again. In fact it's one of the few Disney movies where I liked it just as much as a kid as I do as an adult. It takes me back to that same place I enjoy and I always love coming back.",1324252800,,3041,4.456834532374101
733996,5,6303929338,"I have adored Winnie the Pooh since I was a child and have owned several copies of the The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.  I have owned the Friendship Edition DVD and more recently the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD, because my 3-year-old broke the Friendship Edition DVD.  When I tried to purchase another Friendship Edition at a local store, to my surprise, it was not longer available for sale.) I am appalled at the recent price gouging that is happening on this site for these two DVD copies of the movie.  I purchased the Friendship Edition for $19.99 at Target 18 months ago and The 25th Anniversary Edition used in ""like new"" condition at a movie trading retailer about 6 months ago for $16.99.  I strongly recommend that amazon.com customers look elsewhere to purchase copies of these DVDs.  There is no excuse for this flagrant exploitation of consumers, especially parents who want to share their love of Disney with their children but can't afford inflated pricing like this. :  I guess I got lucky when my daughter broke her DVD earlier this year and not recently.

With regard to this copy of the movie, it is almost exactly like the Friendship Edition.  Thank goodness, because my daughter would be devastated if she didn't have a copy of ""A Day for Eeyore"" in the bonus materials.  The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is also the only feature-length film my daughter can sit through.  She gets bored or sometimes frightened by the villains in some other Disney films.  If you can afford it and are willing to be taken to the cleaners in order to purchase a copy from amazon.com sellers, I recommend every family have it in their movie collection.",1319760000,7,1668,4.697594501718213

One curiosity.  I wonder if Disney went back to the film for this transfer.  I don't think they did.  WTP deserves better!  There's some minimal video 'tearing'.

734096,5,6303929338,"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released in theaters on March 11, 1977. The movie is a combination of three featurettes: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is sometime referred as a package film from some film historians. Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree is basically and introduction of the characters, with the exception of Tigger, and basically tells us how Pooh will go to any lengths to get some honey. Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day we are introduced to Tigger and the main story is that Owl's is damaged during a blustery windy day and that Eeyore finds Owl a new home. In the final featurette, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too, Tigger gets on Rabbit's nerves and gets trapped in a tall tree. Unlike other package films, this movie does flow from one segment to another. Overall it is a good family movie. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh gets an AAA+++.

In fact, you'd think that Hollywood is consciously attempting to make kids acquire attention deficit disorder from short frantic video clips in its animations.  If there was ever a ""comfort video"", this would be it.  My kids love this classic. My daughter sings the theme.  The extra shorts and the Carly Simon video is a pleasant bonus as well.

The excellent video transfer of the THX-certified DVD on the 25th Anniversary Edition is great icing on the cake too.  Colors are rich and vibrant.  If there is something that could be added it would be an updated surround version of the soundtrack or at least stereo.  But this would probably add to the price.",1290556800,,820,4.76595744680851

(Forgot the name), and a Bonus Story called ""A Day for Eeyore""

Here is a partally full summary of this video...
Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree: Winnie the Pooh wants honey and tries two different approaches for honey. Both approaches fail. Next, Pooh goes to Rabbit's house for honey and eats all the jars. But, Pooh can't go out of Rabbit's front door! He's stuck! Next, Rabbit calls Christopher Robin and they try to pull him out. They can't. He's stuck. So they wait for him to get thin again. One day, Pooh moves! Everyone tries to pull him out of the hole. Will the team get Pooh out? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day: It's a windy day in the Hundred Acre Wood. Piglet gets blown away by the wind and Pooh pulls him on a string. They ""fly"" to Owl's house. All of a sudden, Owl's House falls down! Eeyore goes to find him a new house. At night, it isn't windy anymore. It's rainy. There's a big flood in the Hundred Acre Wood. Everyone goes to Christopher Robin's house, which can't be affected by a flood. However, Piglet and Pooh are still in the flood. Owl goes to rescue them. Pooh and Piglet float down to Christopher Robin's house and Christopher Robin believes Pooh rescued Piglet. They have a party for Pooh. In the middle of the party for Pooh, Eeyore appears. He says he found a house for Owl. Everyone goes to see the house. Instead of being happy, everyone is shocked. Why are they shocked? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Winnie the Pooh and the Tigger Too: Rabbit tries to teach Tigger a lesson because he bounces too much. His plan is to lose him in the forest and find him again the next day. When they find him, he'll be a Tigger that doesn't bounce at all. The next day, Rabbit, Piglet, and Pooh set out to ""lose"" Tigger. Instead of losing Tigger, Rabbit's plan backfires and someone else gets ""lost."" Who got lost? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Winnie the Pooh and the Winter Story: Tigger and Roo go bouncing in the snow. However, Tigger gets stuck on a tall tree and everyone comes to rescue him. Everyone finally got Tigger down. However, Tigger makes a promise up in a tree that everyone is unhappy about except Rabbit. Why is Rabbit the only one happy about this promise? Find out by purchasing The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. (This story is short!)

Bonus Story: A Day for Eeyore: Eeyore gets stuck in a river and everyone finally gets him out. Rabbit asks Eeyore why he was in rhe river in the first place. Eeyore says that Tigger bounced him in the river. Tigger says he coughed and Eeyore fell in. At the end, the evidence shows that Tigger bounced him in the river. Everyone gets mad at Tigger for bouncing Eeyore in the river. At the end, Pooh discovers it's a really special day for Eeyore. It's his BIRTHDAY! But, he hasn't gotten a single present. Pooh gives him a empty honey pot, and Piglet gives him a broken balloon. Eeyore is really happy. During Eeyore's party, something happens that turns his smile upside down. What is it?

734141,5,6303929338,I bought this video for my three year old daughter and she loves them.  It is the same Winnie-the-Pooh that I grew up with.,1281312000,,123,4.125
734142,5,6303929338,"When the first Winnie the Pooh short animated feature was released, I was on the cusp of adolescence, totally uninterested, I vaguely remember seeing some commercials after Disney's ""Wonderful World of Color"" TV show.  Many years later, my wife introduced me to the Winnie the Pooh phenomenon.  She's nine years younger than I, and was raised on the original A.A. Milne stories and the Disney films; when our son was born she was determined he love Pooh and friends as much as she, he did, and so did I!

""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" is actually a compilation of 3 short films into a full-length feature, which was Walt Disney's plan.  He felt that although the Winnie the Pooh characters were well known and loved in Britain and Europe this was not quite the case in America.  Introducing them gradually as a series of short films beginning in 1966 would gain acceptance & recognition by American audiences, and then they would be linked together as a complete film.  His plan worked splendidly although sadly he didn't live to see it, the film opened in 1977, and Pooh and company have become household names for American kids.

Winnie the Pooh, or Pooh as he is more commonly known, is a cuddly golden yellow teddy bear that loves honey.  He lives in the Hundred Acre Wood, along with his close friends, the ebullient, bouncing Tigger, the small, timid Piglet, the gloomy donkey Eeyore, Kanga and her little boy Roo, the garrulous Owl, querulous Rabbit and the whistlin' Gopher.  This little band are all close friends and all look to Christopher Robin, a little boy who frequently visits them for help and guidance when it's needed.  He is the ideal friend, mentor and advisor to them, and there is mutual love shared among them all.

The stories are wonderfully innocent in their simplicity, with a gentle humor that is ideal for toddlers up to ages six or seven.  The characters are good role models for young children, they back each other up, help each other out when needed, and they never criticize one another or argue.  Yet they are never boring, they're entertaining, charming and loveable, full of the wonder of childhood, when a child begins to discover the wide world of imagination, peopled with the most fantastic characters and places.

There couldn't be more ideal casting for the actors that supply the voices, beginning with Sterling Holloway as Pooh.  His warm, honeyed drawl is charming and soothing to the ear.  Master ventriloquist Paul Winchell with his exuberant lisp brings the bouncy Tigger to carefree life.  John Fiedler supplies the uncertain treble of Piglet, while Ralph Wright is the deep bass voice for the pessimistic Eeyore.  Barbara Luddy, a Disney veteran, gives sweet, maternal tones to Kanga, and Sebastian Cabot lends his polished English accent as the Narrator.  The other actors are all marvelous as well.  However, it's not just the voices but how they use them; they are all masters in breathing life and emotion into these cartoon characters and making them as real as you and I.

The musical score is by the Disney in-house songwriting team, the Sherman Brothers, and it's delightful, easy, simple melodies and lyrics a child can appreciate & remember given enough viewings.  Actually not just children, I found myself while lathering up in the shower one morning singing ""I'm just a little black raincloud hovering under the honey tree...""!

My darling wife got her wish fairly early, our son was about six months old in his stroller as we were browsing in our local ""Disney Store"", when he grabbed a plush, cuddly Pooh bear from a display and hugged it to him, so of course we bought it.  Pooh was his nighttime buddy always, even when we went away.  Soon he was watching Pooh's TV show with his mother on the Disney Channel along with this movie, and also two holiday specials that were family favorites, ""Boo to You, Too!"" and ""Winnie the Pooh & Christmas Too!"" (Recommend both highly, unfortunately not sure if they're still available)  On a trip to Disney World back in 1999 when he was just five, he was thrilled when we had ""Breakfast with Pooh"", and he got to hug Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet, etc, pose for photos  & also get their autographs, in addition to going on the Pooh ride!  By that time, I was totally indoctrinated to the world of Pooh and didn't mind at all the repeated viewings of this and other Pooh videos (in the pre DVD days), I loved them just as much as my wife and son, and added to the experience by reading to our boy the original A.A. Milne stories, which I also highly recommend.  As a matter of fact, our family Christmas card that year of 1999 was the three of us posed with Tigger at the Magic Kingdom!

A warning though for parents, the very last vignette in the film is touchingly beautiful, but may leave you misty eyed.  It's Christopher Robin & Pooh alone together just before Christopher is going away to school, bidding each other goodbye for awhile, as Christopher Robin's halcyon childhood starts to ebb away.  The dialogue is so lovingly written,(the title of this review is my favorite line) both Jon Walmsley as Christopher Robin and Sterling Holloway as Pooh put so much emotion and feeling into the words that even the most hardened heart would be moved.  I always have tears in my eyes and a lump in the throat even after many viewings, but I remember one time vividly.  I was sitting with my little boy, who was about a year and a half old, on my lap already wet eyed as Sebastian Cabot intoned the final words as Pooh and Christopher Robin holding hands run happily into the distance.  ""Wherever they go and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on top of the forest a little bear will always be waiting.""  My son waved at the screen and said ""Bye-bye, Pooh!"" as I proceeded to lose the little composure I still had, as it was brought home to me as to how exquisite, precious and fleeting is the world of childhood, and I enveloped him in a bear hug and kiss.

Before closing, a quick word about the extras, they're terrific, and include a making of featurette, the short ""A Day for Eeyore"" ""The 100 Acre Wood Challenge"" game, Disney Storytime, ""Pooh's Shadow"", a sing-along song"" the Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" Carly Simon singing the Winnie the Pooh theme song among others.  So share this gem of a movie with your children or grandchildren and treasure the all too short time before they outgrow it.  As for us, we have our son's Pooh bear fluffed and cleaned in a special place of honor all ready for the next generation when it comes!",1276128000,2,6583,4.666666666666667

734213,5,6303929338,"This was never really on my list of movies to watch, but I stumbled on it one day when I had nothing to do, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out.  I kept in mind the sad necessity of cutting parts out of a book for a movie adaptation, and I dreaded seeing what would be left out of this one because I'm such a fan of the original Pooh books.  Disney did great with Pinocchio, but Peter Pan seemed to lose something in the transition, and I hoped Pooh wouldn't suffer the same fate.

Sadly, the Pooh Sticks story was left out, and as far as I know it was released on a different Pooh video cassette some years after the original full length movie.  In its place is a story about the first snowfall in the hundred-acre wood that's fairly bland.  That's the only flaw in the movie I could find.  Everything else (besides Tigger's lack of cuteness) was either as good as the original Milne stories or actually better.

The most noticeable improvement is in the character of Rabbit.  He's so generic in the books, but Disney really brought him to life.  And him using Pooh's rear end as a hunting trophy was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  He seems to take the place of Eeyore in a lot of the segments, suffering from all kinds of misfortune.  (Eeyore doesn't show up much in the movie, probably because his character is way too depressing.)

The score by the Sherman Brothers is once again top notch, and best demonstrated in the nightmare Pooh has about Heffalumps and Woozles - one of my favorite Disney movie scenes.

Impressive in its creativity and humor, The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh was probably by far the best Disney film released during the period from the late 60's to the late 80's.",1264896000,,1730,4.419558359621451
734214,5,6303929338,"I think I can say that I don't believe there is an influence in my life greater than Winnie the Pooh.
I realize that may seem silly or pathetic but Pooh was the first books read to me, the first books I read.
Pooh's take on friendship, loyalty, compassion, even courage opened very young eyes to what I could be as a person before I even understood that someday I would become a person and would have to choose what type I was going to be.
Values such as these should , hopefully, never become outdated.",1264204800,,503,4.25
734215,2,6303929338,"I bought this DVD for my 2 year old son who is a fanatic of Winnie the Pooh.  I introduced the character through two DVD's that feature the Adventures of the Super Sleuths and we both love the videos.

When he started to watch this DVD, his jaw dropped, and after 15 minutes he wanted me to stop it.  I must say I agree with him.  Pooh is not casted in a very good light. He fumbles constantly and he is a gluton.  Eeyore is truly depressed and when Pooh gets stuck after eating to much, rabbit keeps lamenting inviting him to eat...and the bees are just laughing when thinking of stinging Pooh!  If you watch the Super Sleuths, the characters all have their flaws but their talents are also highlighted, with an emphasis on team effort.  I didn't grow up with Winnie the Pooh, so although I was aware of some of the characters I didn't know the real story.

I am a first time Mom but an old one (45 now).  What I am finding is that most of the old fashioned cartoons like Tom & Jerry or Winnie showcase what I consider outdated values.  My conclusion is that simply the times have changed.  Of course some of these cartoons bring us memories, and they do have some cute stuff, but we face a total different world.  40 years ago we taught our children to be afraid of wolfs and kill them, now we want to reintroduce them to the wild.  Before we were awed with the development of incredible cities, now we are trying to save the last rainforests.  Our children will have to be aware of AIDs, terrorism, live in an overpopulated world, learn not to discriminate against other cultures and well, the list is endless.

734245,5,6303929338,"Could you find a nicer, more innocent film than this one? I don't know. I haven't seen one.

What this DVD is, I think, is a compilation of three films woven into one full-length film, movies that were originally done in the mid to late-1960s and then put into this format later. Whatever, it's simply a bunch of nice stories about the famous Pooh and his friends.

This is refreshing in that there is very, very little violence and no evil characters, no bad guys, both of which are unusual in animated films. The stories are told through a ""book"" which is pictured as the stories unfold. Illustrations are shown in the book and they they come to life to show the particularly story.

The voice of Pooh was done by one of the great voices in Hollywood history: Sterling Holloway. All the characters are quite different and there is nice humor here and there for adults and kids. This is as sweet-natured a film as you could ever find. To some it may sound boring, but it's so different in its approach that it is subtly appealing to all ages.

Because of this, there is no consistent story from beginning to end other than the usual hapless, hijinks of the animals from Hundred Acre Wood. I really would have preferred the complete original cartoons, but that's why I don't work for Disney.

They certainly don't make cartoons like this anymore though (too busy with soulless rubbish like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Meet-the-Robinsons-Blu-ray/dp/B000ROAK36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Meet the Robinsons [Blu-ray</a>]). TMAOWTP was certainly one of their last greats of old-school animation. The seasonal colors of Hundred Acre Wood and the backgrounds are rather enchanting and atmospheric. I actually had a huge poster from Winnie Pooh and the Blustery Day on my bedroom wall when I was a kid and I could literally look at it for hours as there was so much detail to it.

I'm not too keen on Christopher Robin though, he's just a bit too effeminate for me. I hear that Disney are planning on replacing him with a tomboyish girl for future Winnie the Pooh projects. Well, I'm fine with that. The Disney-fied Pooh deviates so far from AA Milne's creation that one more alteration is hardly significant.

The only other short is A Day For Eeyore. It's Eeyore's birthday, but none of his so-called friends have bothered to notice. Pooh has made a new game involving chucking sticks into the river to see which one wins in a race. He calls it 'Pooh Sticks'. Now, where I come from that particular noun means something completely different.

When Eeyore comes floating along they realize that he is more depressed than usual. When he reveals why the day is supposed to be so special they all run off to find makeshift presents and prepare a party. It actually works, and he cheers up.

A fine Winnie the Pooh short, with the great animation and wonderful backgrounds we've come to expect. It also keeps Christopher Robin to a minimum.

And why don't they ever call him Winnie?",1224201600,,2449,5.381201044386423

734306,5,6303929338,"I grew up watching the original Disney cartoons, and this DVD brings back wonderful, vivid memories.  Based on the classic book by A. A. Milne, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh delightfully brings to life Christopher Robin, The Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh, and all of his friends.  Included are the all the timeless favorites:  Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), the Oscar-winning Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too (1974).  Wow, was it really as late as 1974 that we met Tigger for the first time?  I feel like I have know him since I was born!

This masterpiece contains some of the most incredible, memorable, and recognizable voice talent of all time, including Sterling Holloway as Pooh, Paul Winchell as Tigger, and John Fiedler as Piglet.  Sebastian Cabot narrates, speaking directly to the characters and to us, and tying all the stories together.  Pooh and his friends clearly loved Sebastian Cabot just as much as we did.

The songs are most firmly fixed in my mind - ""Hefalumps and Woozles"", ""The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers"", ""I'm Just a Little Back Rain Cloud"", and of course ""Winnie the Pooh"" to name just a few.  We hum and sing and dance to each one.  The memories are strong here; all the words come pouring back.

For the 25th anniversary addition, the animation has been lovingly and vividly restored to its original glory.  This DVD is as stunning as I remember the originals to be. As the pages of the book turn, Pooh seems to leap off the page, and into your heart.

734414,5,6303929338,"Winnie-the-Pooh is an old childhood favorite of mine. From seeing cartoons on TV to keeping only two of my old childhood toys (a Pooh bear that had lost it's shirt and a tiger that reminded one of Tigger) to ""The House At Pooh Corner"" being the first full-length book I read, the bear with very little brain was a large influence on my early life.

Disney's adaptation of Pooh was my introduction, and I have Walt Disney to thank for that. I wanted to own all of the adaptations (just as I quickly collected all four of Milne's books) on video. There were ""Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Tree,"" ""Winnie-the-Pooh and the Blustery Day,"" and ""Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger, Too."" There was also another cartoon called ""Winnie-the-Pooh and a Day for Eeyore.""

My first Pooh video was ""Winnie-the-Pooh and the Blustery Day,"" which is, to this day, stuck in a defective VCR which we later disposed of. Later, shortly after my 17th birthday, I bought the VHS of the 25th anniversary edition of ""The Many Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh,"" the feature film compilation of the features. After about 3 viewings, the tape refused to play.

Shortly afterward, I switched to DVD, but goodness! There were so many titles that I wanted to get that Pooh fell far behind.

Today, however, I now own this new DVD edition. It has everything I loved about the old VHS tapes, and more. Included from the ""Many Adventures"" tape is ""The Story Behind the Masterpiece"" featurette, originally made for the film's first VHS release, ""Winnie-the-Pooh and a Day for Eeyore,"" and Carly Simon's music video for ""Winnie-the-Pooh."" There are more features, including all the still relevant features from the 25th Anniversary DVD, and a couple new ones, including the first episode of ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh.""

Today, it makes me sad that Disney has relegated Pooh to preschool entertainment and cheesy family films. Probably the best thing they did since the cartoons' releases was the animated TV series ""The New Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh,"" which they should release a complete collection to DVD...

I feel that the DVD could have used 2 discs. There could be three ways to watch the film, all possible with branching techniques. How about being able to watch the original shorts seperately, or together in the film, and being able to see the film's TV version with ""A Day For Eeyore"" included? (See, I have ideas!) The first disc could have the film, the viewing options (with extra bits of footage), and ""A Day For Eeyore,"" and the pop-up trivia track (which should be replaced with an audio commentary... too bad Christopher Robin Milne has passed away). The second disc would have all the features.

When Disney releases the title again in 2012, maybe they should take my advice. (Of course, by that time, they'll probably be phasing out regular DVDs for Blu-Ray or something else...)

Anyways, even though the DVD doesn't quite meet my fondest wishes, it is still delightful and I am glad to have it in my DVD collection at last.",1182211200,8,3002,4.849609375
734415,5,6303929338,"Despite new packaging and a hokey new subtitle, this release of Disney's original three Winnie the Pooh featurettes is actually identical to the 2002 ""25th Anniversary Edition"" -- same video, same audio, same bonus features. And for once, that's good! That earlier DVD transfer was already digitally restored and had some good extras, including ""A Day for Eeyore"" and one of Disney's better making-of documentaries, but was pulled off the shelves early last year. Now, however, it's back, with the same vibrant colors, sharp focus and near-perfect 5.1 soundtrack.

In other words, this is Disney at its best. ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" is a charming, gentle, quality film that hasn't aged a bit and looks and sounds terrific. Unless you already own the ""25th Anniversary Edition,"" this new release is a must.

Actually, there is one new bonus feature: an episode of the computer-animated Disney Channel series, ""My Friends Tigger and Pooh."" In case you haven't seen it, it adds two new characters to the story: Darby, a 6-year-old girl, and her dog Buster.",1182038400,325,1070,5.03954802259887

Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966)

Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968)

Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! (1974)

Also included:

Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore (1983)

WTP and the Honey Tree (sp HUNNY)

This is the first episode and here we have Pooh visiting an unenthusiastic Rabbit who never enjoys Pooh's company because of his amazing appetite: Pooh's exercise song-""When I up down touch the ground

Puts me in the mood-

Up down touch the ground-

In the mood-

for Food!""

Pooh, predictably, eats up every last ""smackerel"" of Rabbit's hunny and finds he is now so tubby he is unable to leave Rabbit's house as he cannot squeeze through the hole!

The animals run to get Christoper Robin, who, after some consideration, decides Pooh must go on a crash diet. This experiment lasts several agonizing days for both Pooh and Rabbit, who tries in vain to disguise this plump bear and sits in his chair in despair.

Eventually Pooh returns to his former ""svelte"" state and emerges from Rabbit's hole with such force he is flung into the next page of the storybook and finds himself in the hole of a hunny tree!

WTP and the Blustery Day

It is Wednesday, or WINDSDAY in the Hundred Acre Wood, and little Piglet is industriously sweeping fallen leaves in front of his house-""It's not the leaves that are going, it's the leaves that are coming!"" and Pooh comes by just in time to catch hold of Piglet's scarf to keep him from being carried away in the stiff breeze.

Kanga and Roo hop by and Roo begs Pooh: ""Can I fly Piglet next?""

The Blustery Day turns into an even more Blustery Night and Pooh hears a Noise. He opens his door to investigate and hears the Noise again-this time he decides (being a bear of Very Little Brain) to invite the Noise in.

Here we have a joyous introduction to Tigger, T-I-Double-Ger Tigger!

The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers-

Is Tiggers are wonderful Things-

Their Tops are made out of Rubber-

Their Bottoms are madde out of Springs-

They're Bouncy Flouncy Bouncy Flouncy Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun!

But the most Wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the Only One! I'm-the only one!

Tigger, after trying Pooh's hunny and finding Tiggers DON'T like it, warns Pooh to beware of Heffalumps and Woozles...

Tigger departs leaving Pooh alone to patrol his house guarding against these unknown but scary sounding beasts.

Eventually he gets tired and falls asleep dreaming of Heffalumps and Woozles clomping, tromping and trumpeting through his head in a wonderful sequence reminiscent of the Pink Elephant part in Dumbo.

The next day the 100 Acre Wood is flooded and Piglet gets swept away on the water clutching a chair. Eventually Piglet is rescued and the friends all meet with Christopher Robin to help Owl find a home to replace the one he lost in the storm. Eeyore ambles over and takes the group to Owl's new home, which turns out to be Piglet's!

No one says anything and Piglet generously allows Owl to have his former home and Pooh puts his arm around Piglet and invites him to move into his house.

This touching episode ends with a party for the heroes of the day and everyone happy and no one homeless.

WTP and Tigger Too

Tigger's bounce gets on Rabbit's nerves and the friends try to lose him on a trip into the Woods. Rabbit winds up getting lost and scared and Tigger rescues him. Tigger, resuming his bounce, bounces himself into a tree and elicits the help of Sebastian Cabot, the Narrator, to Narrate him down, which Cabot obligingly does, by tipping the book and letting Tigger slide down to the next page of the book.

The last episode is WTP and a Day for Eeyore

Eeyore's Birthday and he thinks no one remembers it. But the gang gets together and eventually give Eeyore his gifts, not in their original condition (Pooh eats all the hunny in the pot which was his gift and Piglet pops the balloon which was his gift) but gratefully accepted nonetheless. Here we are introduced to the new game of Poohsticks.

This is really excellent animation and storytelling, with the Disney stalwart Sterling Holloway bringing Pooh to life with his wonderful voice (Cheshire Cat) and Paul Winchell as Tigger.

The last feature Disney oversaw personally (with the exception of the last short) and a fine one it is.

Pooh is an indispensable addition to any childhood and the animators have a distinct Ernest Shepard flavor to their work, which adds even more to this great classic.

In the first portion of the movie, we see Winnie the Pooh, silly old Pooh bear, attempt to get honey from high up in a tree.  While Pooh may be a little short on brains, he is long on humor and charm.  In the second portion of the movie wind and rain wreak havoc on the 100 Acre Wood, and Pooh (Sterling Holloway), Kanga and Roo, Owl, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Piglet all must figure out how to survive, retaining all the charm and cleverness of the first portion of the movie.  In the final portion of the movie we get an extended look at Tigger, with all his bouncy charm.  Of course, we must remember that Tigger is the only one!

There are many words to characterize Disney movies.  Sometimes they are great.  They are often funny.  Sometimes they are tense.  Usually they are family oriented.  I characterize this movie by one word:  charming.  The characters are all charming and sweet.  The characters capture childhood innocence perfectly.  The youngest members of your family will love that silly old Pooh bear and all his friends and will want to watch this movie over and over again.  This movie is a must for all family home film libraries.

Otherwise, this one has a good amount of charm to it. Of course, it helps when the source material is superior, as the A.A. Milne books clearly are. Nonetheless, the artistic rendering and the actor's voices are indelibly linked with these characters, meaning Disney struck all the right chords when it brought these stories to the screen.",1157068800,3,710,4.688

734473,5,6303929338,"The whole family will find this cute, but very young children will get the biggest kick out of it. This is probably one of Disney's best. Charming story based on childrens books by A.A. Milne who wrote based on his son Christopher Robin's adventures with a bear at the zoo and the stuffed animals that were made for him. You can't beat the animation, narration, voices, or music used in this wonderful animated version of the story. This is a timeless classic that generations will enjoy. Get it for your kids and keep if for your grandchildren.

I immediately bought it when it first became available. I'm glad I did as Disney in it's infinite wisdom sells a certain number and doesn't produce more for eight years typically. This is their marketing strategy for keeping demand up. Personally I think their marketing person or whomever thought that up should take a long walk off a short pier. What it means is your kids at the prime of when they should see it won't unless you own one all ready. Now being the wonderful guy that I am, I'm sure your possitive votes will show it. I am going to tell you to go to eBay.com and search this title. There are some reliable people still selling copies for less than half what you see the scalpers here trying to get for it. Be careful for copies.

734527,5,6303929338,"Before his death, Walt Disney had started his staff on a series of shorts starring A. A. Milne's creation Winnie the Pooh.  Because he knew American audiences weren't that familiar with the character yet, he decides that a series of short features would be best, followed by a movie combining them together.  This is that movie.  Originally released in 1977, it combines the three shorts that had been previously released, ""Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,"" ""Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day,"" and ""Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too"" with a couple new transitions to make the stories flow together.

The story is set in the Hundred Acre Wood where Winnie the Pooh, a bear with very little brain, lives along with his friends.  There's Christopher Robin, a young boy, wise Owl, gloomy Eeyore, Rabbit, small and easily frightened Piglet, Kanga and her son Roo, and bouncy Tigger.  No matter what they face, they face it together, at least in the end.

The first set of stories revolves around Pooh's love of honey.  When he runs out, he tries to get some from bees and then visits Rabbit where he gets stuck after eating too much.

A natural disaster visits the Hundred Acre woods when a blustery day is followed by a flood.  While facing danger, Pooh also learns about Heffalumps and Woozles who may be after his honey.

Finally, Tigger's bouncing gets the best of Rabbit and he tries to debounce Tigger.  Undeterred, Tigger gets himself and Roo stuck in a tree.

These cartoons are sweet and innocent.  They easily bring back memories of childhood and simpler times.  There is gentle humor and the simple lessons aren't done in a heavy-handed manner.

The style of the animation is fairly unique in the Disney canon.  It's pencil line heavy.  Even though the artists have made it their own, it still reminds the view of Ernest Shepherds charming ""decorations"" from the books.

These stories are very true to their source material.  The new character Gopher is introduced, but as he's not in the book, he's not even in the second half.  Probably the most curious choice was the use of a book.  The pages turn as the story progresses and we move in on page illustrations to see what happens next.  I'll admit it took me quite some time to get used to the idea, but I do see the charm in it now.

The main audience for this movie has always been kids, and the 25th anniversary release reflects that.  Most of the features are kid friendly, with games, a sing along song, and a story time segment.  Adults will enjoy the behind the scenes featurette.  You can choose to watch the movie with pop up facts running.  Most of them are ordinary, but there are a few fun trivia items included.  Also included is the short ""A Day for Eeyore.""  It was originally released in 1981 and features a few new voices because of cast deaths.  It's a fun feature with a couple of my favorite stories from the books, but is a little disconcerting to watch right after seeing the film.  As to the film itself, the picture is sharp and the sound is great.  It's presented in full frame.  I have no proof, but I suspect that was the original aspect ration.

This is a nice film for young kids.  Adults may not enjoy it as much as some kid's films, but if they watch with an open mind, it will release their inner child.",1130803200,67,3299,4.532203389830508

The characters in this movie are many, and each has a charming, and unique personality that adds to the synergy of the cast.  While the storyline isn't all that riveting, the interplay between the characters makes you feel as though you could have dreamed about them as a child, playing in the backyard (100 acre wood) with your stuffed animal toys.  Admittedly, the heffalumps and whoozles skit appears to be ""drug induced"" on the part of the animators, but it's just a little dark humor mixed in to balance the sometimes sterile innocence of the film.  There is enough wrong with the world today that a little pure escapism couldn't but help, so kick back and enjoy a true Disney animated classic.",1106870400,5,809,4.757142857142857

However, the main reason I prefer ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" over any of the other Disney movies featuring Pooh Bear is the way this movie is set up.  It's a compilation of several of the classic Pooh short stories, instead of one long movie.  I find my two-year old gets much more out of watching the individual 10 minute stories, as opposed to attempting to sit through a full-length, animated film.
Thus, keeping the little ones (ages 1-5) and their attention spans in mind, I highly recommend ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" to be a must for any family video collection!",1085184000,8,632,4.575221238938053

We have the Piglet movie as well, but it's just not the same Pooh, and she doesn't seem quite as interested in it. The best thing about this DVD is that it's something she loves, and something that won't drive me crazy like Barney or Teletubbies, so even when I've heard the Rumbly in my Tumbly song six times in a day, hearing it one more time doesn't really bother me.

734589,5,6303929338,"This is one of the Disney's materpieces. I'm in my 20's and I grew up with Winnie the pooh not only with the movie but with the tv series and the Book. It is hard to imagine a more delightful DVD introduction to A. A. Milne's cherished Winnie the Pooh books than this 1977 short stories, which gathered the Disney studio's original trio of animated featurettes: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966): Pooh of course goes out looking for hunny and gets into some trouble, the Oscar-winning Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968): the hundred acre woods is flooded and piglet is in trouble, and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too (1974):this is one of my favorite of the short stories where you meet tigger and you hear him sing his memorable song. Pooh was a pet project of Walt Disney, whose children loved the books about the ""willy nilly silly old bear"" and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood. Faithful to the look and gentle spirit of the books, these mellow shorts do Milne proud. With the voices of Sterling Holloway as Pooh, Paul Winchell as Tigger, and John Fiedler as Piglet, the delightful characters come to life. The DVD edition includes a honey jar full of additional special features, including interactive sing-alongs and various activities. But the best part is how they restored the animation vivid and stunning as i would believe as when the movies first arrived in theathers. This movie is my family's favorite. At least once a month my nephew watches it and sings along and is enchanted by silly Pooh, little piglet, gloomy eeyore, rabbit and his gardening,know it all owl, kanga and little roo and bouncy tigger too. This is sure to be in your dvd collection already or soon, where you can be enchanted by one of disney's greatest materpieces about a boy named christopher robin and his nilly silly old bear pooh and his friends and a wonderful place called the hundred acre woods!

This is Walt Disney's 22nd full-length animated movie masterpiece. Winnie the Pooh was created in the 1920s out of British author A.A. Milne's whimisical stories he told to his son Christopher Robin.  The character Pooh was created from Christopher's toy bear Edward Bear, and from his favorite London zoo friend ""Winnie,"" a black bear. The name ""Pooh"" came from a swan residing also at the zoo. The film is a gathering of these wonderful moments and Disney's magic weaves them into this joyful feature-length movie.

The original stories are ""The Honey Tree,"" ""The Blustery Day"" and ""Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too."" ""Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day"" was nominated and won Best Cartoon Short Subject in 1968.

But just as Christopher Robin goes off to school, my children slowly outgrow the Bear Stuffed with Fluff.  Only the 6 year old still watches this movie on occasion but the others have such fond memories that Pooh and Tigger got ranked 18th out of 41.  This movie is all good and smiles.  If my children were all still under 7 this would probably be ranked in our top 10.
My only criticism is that the inking of the artwork didn't seem to match the standards set in other Disney productions and could have be sharper.
We also have Search for Christopher Robin that was also about equal in popularity when the kids were younger.  Amazon ranks this movie at about 1,100, a very strong showing that would put this movie in the top 10 of the 41 we ranked.  We give it 3 stars given the current ages of the family members involved in the ranking.  Still, 18th means it beat out 23 others, but that the family liked 17 Disney cartoon movies better.  Tiggers are Fun Fun Fun, Fun Fun.
We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad.

This video still gets picked after nearly 3 years of owning it! My son loves the songs and he always points out a ""honey tree"" in one of the parks we go to.

A notable omission is the lack of a separate song menu.  They do have a sing along bonus with the DVD as well as a short about Eyeore. Another negative is the length -- you do have to watch with your child and cut short or they would have been sitting in front of the TV for an hour before you know it!  Its presented the same as the movie, and not as individual shorts accesible from a menu Plus, all of the situations are scary, such as getting stuck, getting your house blown down, flooded out etc. though presented in such a pooh way, that it won't scare them too much.

734631,4,6303929338,"This is not, by far, the best of Disney.  The three animated shorts that were originally stitched together to make ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" date from the late 1960's to the early 1970's, not a vintage Disney era, and it shows.  The animation, while miles above TV-quality fare, isn't particularly good compared to the earlier Disney classics, there are several rather careless holes in the dialogue and plot, and the whole storybook motif is overdone to the point that a rather important plot element (Tigger getting down from the tree) depends entirely upon the narrator.  True purists are also appalled at the changes Disney wrought upon A.A. Milne and Ernest Shepard's original characters.
For my part, I think the Disney animators did as good a job here of maintaining the general atmosphere of the original Milne stories as was ever done--the modern efforts don't even come close, and actually reduce the Pooh characters to a status on a par with just about anything else.  I also have a sentimental attachment to the original Disney shorts, since I basically grew up watching them occasionally on TV.  These are gentle stories that will appeal to a wide range of ages, from extremely young (my daughter has been watching them since before she could speak) to late adolescence.  The plot consists of a number of rather underwhelming and pointless events in the lives of a number of stuffed animals inhabiting the ""Hundred Acre Wood,"" which is rather refreshing from Disney, actually:  no pandering, no didacticism, just (as Homer Simpson might say) ""a bunch of stuff that happens.""  The music is occasionally memorable as well; if, after countless viewings demanded by your child(ren), you don't have Pooh's ""up-down"" song, or ""Little Black Raincloud,"" or the title song, or for that matter ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" running pleasantly through your head, you have no head for music at all.
I have never been particularly impressed with the ""extras"" included with most DVDs, but in this case the folks at Disney have included the fourth theatrical short, ""A Day for Eeyore,"" which is a very nice bonus, especially since prior to this release one had to buy each short separately on videotape.  The short itself is a bit shocking, though, since the voices, with the exception of Tigger, are radically different.
Overall, a nice single-disc package of ""classic"" Disney Pooh, and something you can show your child(ren) without fear or guilt.",1039219200,5,2468,5.014669926650367

When I got pregnant with our son, however, I was forced into looking at Pooh and friends from a whole new perspective.  My husband has loved Classic Pooh and even Disney's version for as long as he can remember, and was determined to have the nursery decorated in Pooh.  This meant I had to get used to it again.  Argh!  Then, suddenly, I reread the stories I had read as a child and loved.  I still loved them.  Hmmm... maybe Pooh wasn't so bad after all!  By the time Alekz was born, I was again a full-fledged fan of Pooh and so when my husband asked if we could buy this DVD, I didn't hesitate.

My son, on the other hand, just sat there absorbing the whole thing (he's only 3, but he can watch TV with the best of them).
The only thing I'd give thumbs-down to on this DVD is the film transfer quality.  The film is rather old now, and the dyes and the paints they used back then are wearing unevenly.  This gives a sort of mottled look to some of the larger patches of color, and makes me wonder why they didn't ""digitally remaster"" the print to get the highest clarity.  Wouldn't have been that hard to do.
But the bonus material is exellent, and the film itself is the classic that I remember it to be.
Interesting fact: there were three different people who did the voice for Christopher Robin, but that's only because this version of the film is actually three short films put together with a special scene at the end with Christopher Robin saying good-bye to Pooh.

I was very surprised to see that the majority of the movie's vignettes were produced by Walt himself before his death. I have never read any other the original stories by A.A.

The film offers simplistic animation, becuase of budget or artistic integrity - - I do not know.  I assume it's the latter becuase the art works perfectly. The art looks just like drawings would look in an old English children's book.
This is indeed probably one of the few Disney classics that children 2 years and under could watch all the way through without having to skip over an evil witch, or a pirate, which are too intense for toddlers. For parents, this film is far from the worst thing you could sit through. It's actually not bad at all. It's full of charm.

734666,5,6303929338,"I bought this DVD for my 2-year-old daughter but found myself lost in nostalgic memories of my own childhood, when I watched these as individual tales.  The charming stories of friendship between very different creatures are entertaining, and also nice springboards for discussions with little ones. It's remarkably quiet and old-fashioned compared to many of today's options for children, which I love!  It's pleasant background noise while I get a few things done, but also a DVD I will just as often will sit and watch with my child.
The video itself is the most enjoyable item on the DVD.  The ""A Day for Eeyore"" is not the ""classic"" it claims to be, poorly drawn and with a voice-over for Pooh not even reminiscent of the original. The sing-a-long and game are favorites of my daughter as well.
The songs are classics you will be surprised you can sing with.  Be ready to ""fast-forward"" through the ""Heffalumps and Woozles""  if your children are very small.",1023408000,3,962,4.806060606060606
734667,5,6303929338,"I have to say that as far as children's animation goes, Winnie-the-Pooh is classic. These tales are cute, cute, cute and you can' t go wrong with it. It has all of those catchy tunes that you can sing with your kids. It is fun even for me to watch with my daughter on a rainy day. It has the magic to make you feel good and it is something that you can enjoy over and over again. I was so glad when I found out it was going to be released on DVD. Winnie-the-Pooh is a cartoon masterpiece",1023408000,,487,3.9292929292929295

There is a game, which I think is most definitely more aimed for young children, but I couldn't resist!  What fun!
This is an ultimate disney purchase.  It ranks up there with the special edition of Snow White on dvd, which is the best Disney DVD to own in my opinion. See my review of Snow White for more!
I don't really remember watching Pooh cartoons when I was growing up, but I do remember watching them over and over when I was babysitting. That got me hooked on Pooh. I was 19, and now am 32..and still adore Pooh and his friends. Classic disney cartoons that make us laugh and smile should enchant anyone!
Watching these videos as an adult just makes me remember how simple life was as a child, and it reminds me of the importance of friendship.
These old Pooh cartoons look outstanding on dvd, and also had such better animators than the newer Pooh videos. You can see the comparision of the two on the extras of the dvd.
Pooh has become a huge franchise, but I opt for this one dvd, and my stuffed Pooh bear and the old books. All the new stuff is just not the same.
He also has a huge fan base ranging widely in age. There are many adults that love him. What's not to love? He's a cuddly bear, and such a sweet one. even without his honeypot.
I highly recommending purchasing this dvd! It is worth the price for all the extras and especially for the three animation shorts staring Pooh and Co.
As Tigger would say, TTFN..ta ta for now!",1022198400,,1615,4.323432343234323

The addition of ""The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" animated video ensures that I'll get this soon.  I'm sure that every adult has already watched it, loved it, and can't wait to pass it on. If you're too young for a credit card, pester your parents for it.  Mention that it's for a Disney movie (esp. Pooh), and they'll most likely buy it for you.",1021334400,,535,4.484536082474227
734670,5,6303929338,"I purchased this for my 4 year old despite his strenuous objections and continuous pleadings for Bob, Thomas, and the rest of the usual suspects.  In spite of this the bear was an immediate hit.  He won't stop watching it.",1020902400,2,222,4.525
734671,5,6303929338,"Get this copy even if you have others of the same movie!! First of all, did you know the original voice of Roo(Clint Howard, son of Ron Howard and Roo is my favorite character!)currently starred in Austin powers movies and The Grinch? WHOA!!! You don't just get the movie, you also get:
1. Winnie the Pooh and A Day For Eeyore
2. A making of special
3.2 Upcoming Pooh movies(another holiday one about Xmas and New Year's I may be renting first, and One coming to theaters next year ""Piglet's Big Movie"" I'm glad Kanga and Roo are in that one, and I hope Kanga is once again voiced by Kath Soucie in this one because it's cool to see her voice come out of Kanga's mouth!)
4. And a new version of ""Winnie The Pooh"" by Carly Simon(remember her?) which will also be heard in the upcoming ""Piglet's Big Movie"". It's very bluesy, and who's the guy that sings backup on it?
Anyone who looooooooves Pooh and Carly Simon should get this, They shouldn't be disappointed!!:):) I have just talked about what you'll get if you get the VHS Version!",1020816000,5,1034,4.4188481675392675
