8623049,4,B00GGZ6LG0,"Don Kirschner's Rock Concert brought back a lot of memories staying up late to watch way beck when.
I remember watching the clip of ""Only You Can Rock Me"" That was the song that got me into the band.
Probably the only time we see Mick Bolton playing guitar on ""Boogie For George""..",1430352000,2,281,4.320754716981132
8623050,5,B00GGZ6LG0,"First off this is another release of UFO on the Don Kirschner's Rock Concert 1976 with Michael Schenker!
The photo on front is of Paul Chapman who replaced him much later but filled in for him when he vanished.
Paul Raymond is also pictured but he hadn't joined the band yet. This is confusing to fans! But if you don't
have this concert in your collection you will want to buy this now! Great band deserved bigger audience.",1402790400,6,424,4.448717948717949
