But just last night I watched these two  particular episodes, and now I understand why people become X-Files fans.  It was very suspenseful, and I still can't make heads or tails out of some of the stuff I saw.  But I know I liked it!
The way the climax unfolds in the claustrophobic atmosphere of a single train car which may or may not contain a bomb; and may or may not contain an alien; and may or may not contain a human experiment gone dangerously awry; and may very well contain an agent from the National Security Agency who threatens Mulder's mission (and his life) -- great writing of this caliber is usually only seen in Hitchcock films or the M. Night Shyamalan (sic) films.
If you are (like I was 24 hours ago) not an X-Files fan, just check this one out.  If you like on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense, you won't be disappointed.",1022803200,2,985,4.4748603351955305

In this episodes Mulder traces the video of the Alien authopsy, but this investigation takes show him more a simple fake, they expose the world conspiration to obtain new medical and technological advances obtained from the Aliens. In this two episodes, the two contries ( USA and Japan ), figth to keep the results of the alien investigations for your own beneficts, and show how this experiments was used in normal persons to see the results ( like the microchip planted on Scully and the camp with all the infected people ). This is definitelly one of the most interested chapters in the X-Files saga, and show many things who made more than one person think about the UFO and Alien phenomena and if the goberments really tell all the true to the people.
