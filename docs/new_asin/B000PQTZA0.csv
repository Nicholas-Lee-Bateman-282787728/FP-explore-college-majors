But, since the instant they bet for running away, the unerring wheel of the tragedy has been exposed and so, dark clouds will hover this fragile state of happiness between both of them.

Against all the odds, Quedragogo showed the world Burkina Fasso is presnt at the moment to cite the great artistic achievements of the last year of the eighties.

A majusucle masterwork that certainly will shock you from the very beginning.

It is a truly beautiful artwork that I will strongly recommend for those interested in understanding traditional Africa, especially family and marriage in traditional Burkina Faso. There are several themes being treated in this movie: marriage in the Mossi society, the social organization of the family, the powers of the elders in traditional societies of Burkina Faso, the price to pay when one goes against traditions, and finally the cost of incest in those social formations.
Burkina Faso is the capital of African cinema, and it is not surprising to see a magnificent artwork like Tilai shine again.
