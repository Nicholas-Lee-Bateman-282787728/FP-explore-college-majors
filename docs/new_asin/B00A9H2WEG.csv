8548721,5,B00A9H2WEG,I bought this DVD at a concert by Led Kaapana and Mike Kaawa. But I'm back buying it as a gift. I've watched this DVD several times. Stunningly wonderful begins to explain this DVD. All the artists on this DVD are masters who know their craft inside and out. This is real Hawaiian music and I love every note of it. This DVD brings the spirit of Aloha to wherever it happens to be being played. I've played it a number of times in my backyard and the spirit is right there. The only artist I didn't know about before I owned this DVD was Nathan Aweau. He was a real surprise to me and a great artist that I am glad to now know about too. His performance of E Apo Mai captured my total attention and it was only the first song on the DVD when I first played it. Even after seeing this DVD a number of times it has lost none of its magic. The video and sound quality are both very high and that enhances the enjoyment too.,1378944000,3,920,4.032786885245901

Besides being very enjoyable and entertaining, this DVD is an important piece of Hawai`ian music history which future generations will look to for inspiration.

Mahalo nui loa for this wonderful project!",1355875200,,345,5.254545454545455
