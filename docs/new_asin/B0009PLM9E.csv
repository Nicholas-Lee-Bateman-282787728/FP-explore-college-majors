The only thing was that this box only contains episodes 5-7. I thought that Vector Two meant a new season but it just means like the second disc in a collection of season one.",1270512000,6,288,4.538461538461538

8064875,5,B0009PLM9E,"Firstly, for those of you who have not yet seen past Vector 2, and are patiently awaiting the final two... believe me when I say it's worth the wait. If you liked it up to this point you'll love the final few episodes. You can almost taste the tension. And although you'll have some idea of the way it'll end, you'll be guessing right up until the last few minutes.

If you'd seen Vector 1 and were not quite sure wether or not to invest in the second instalment, I suggest you do. As with any good anime, it takes time to establish the characters and their personalities. Vector 1's episodes carry this out well, and by the 2nd DVD, the story and character progression becomes considerably more interesting.

Indeed, not for the faint of heart (due to violence) but this Anime has a very interesting, and at times genuinely touching story that can be enjoyed by anyone who likes their animes serious.

Having said that, excusing a few particularly violent scenes (one involving a puppy) the violence really isn't all that bad for an anime. It's more blood spurts than all-out guts and gore, so don't worry about throwing up if you're that way inclined!

Elfen Lied isn't for everyone, but what is? You could do much worse than to give this Anime a try, and If you do decide you want to watch it to the end, you will not be let down.

In short, Elfen Lied is a not-so-obvious love story, mixed in  with violence and science fiction. It often presents moments of violence and evil alongside those of beauty and innocence, which, particularly in the later episodes, leaves you completely unable to predict what will happen next. It's this well-balanced blend of themes and genres that makes Elfen Lied what it is - a truly enjoyable anime",1127260800,3,1736,4.565916398713826
8064876,5,B0009PLM9E,this volume of efen lied answers some much needed questions. If you like violence and cool anime pick up this series,1125532800,,116,4.571428571428571
8064877,5,B0009PLM9E,"started watching this series when my husband and i were in the music store and were taking a browse through ZIA's brand new animation aisle when we came across vector two. knew we'd be breakin into the story a little late but were so intrigued by the cover art, just had to buy it! that was the end of that...not a but a few days after vector 1 was on it's way from amazon and we went ahead and downloaded english subtitled versions for the rest of the series. both vectors do not disappoint...and i'm on the edge of my chair waiting for the last two vectors to complete our collection...by far my new favorite!",1125532800,2,611,4.321739130434783
8064878,4,B0009PLM9E,"Vol 1 of Elfen Lied left me a bit confused. I really couldn't figure out if I really liked this series or not. It was good enough to give Vol 2 a try.

And I was not disappointed. The stories are coming together, the characters are getting more indepth, and the tension of events is growing bit by bit.

I was thrilled and horrified by learning about our lil homeless girl and her puppy (Though one detail about the puppy confuses me.. when did he come back??) Besides that, though, we are more and more getting the motivations behind our now settled main characters, some of their actions quite confusing at the beginning. By the end of this volume, I'm ready to find out exactly what is going on. I can't wait.

Definitely not traditional, by any means, mixing together your government killing machine with some of the ackwardness and cuteness of Chobits and the seriousness, violence, and some sexuality that makes it a genre to its own.",1124064000,2,940,4.583333333333333
8064879,5,B0009PLM9E,This is a must see anime.  I watched the first volume and I wasn't too sure what to think.  It takes some adjusting to it in how it blends moods and genres a bit.  Its a very strange mix of Ai Yori Aoshi type humor and fan service with the gore and darkness of something like Berserk and the psychological turmoil moments in Satoshi Kon's Paranoia Agent.  Once you get to the end of the first volume and view the first episode in the second volume you'll be hooked though...Trust me.  The blood and guts are laid on pretty thick (although not the worst I have ever seen in an anime but pretty strong just the same) and the storyline/characters are dynamic and have riveting -- haunting histories and back stories.  I found myself thinking about these characters days after I watched it the first time.  Its a fascinating group this story follows and something tells me this show is headed towards a very tragic conclusion; which quite honestly I'm not too sure I'm all that prepared for...Anxious to see what happens in Volume 3!,1122336000,20,1029,4.52972972972973
8064880,4,B0009PLM9E,"As Vector 2 of Elfen Lied begins, Mayu, the young homeless girl that Kouta and Yuka took in last volume along with Nyu, has run away. She no longer wanted to be a burden on them. As she wanders the streets we see through flashbacks how she ended up as a runaway in the first place. Also on the loose is the pyschotic operative that Lucy dismembered in the first volume, newly reconstructed with cyborg attachments. He goes rogue and is out to revenge himself on Lucy, but how to find her? Another of Lucy's victims shows up and one of Kouta's professor's at college recognizes Nyu as one of his family, but is it really true?

There is really nothing like Elfen Lied out there in the anime world right now. It's a mix of a lot of anime conventions such as memory loss, harem comedy, superhuman fighting, fan service, and shojo. While having all these different genres juggling for your attention seems like a recipe for disaster, Elfen Lied mixes them all together in an entertaining and sometimes disturbing way. You get the same feeling from it as when you read the Battle Royale manga. It might be bloody and violent but there is a poignancy and sadness underneath it all. What is fiction but to put characters into extreme situations and see how they react? It's just that in this case, things are taken to the ultra-extreme. It is a great and thought-provoking show because while it has its sentimental edge, it also shows the horror and callousness that brings about murder.",1121644800,13,1480,4.584905660377358
