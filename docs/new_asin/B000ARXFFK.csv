8079349,1,B000ARXFFK,"I have a vaste collection of Alain Delon DVDs. I thought this would be another one. Wrong. A lousy transfer. Delon's face, in two closeups, has green horizontal lines on it. Lauren Bacall is fat, well what can I say? She should retire and soon. Delon looked like he was waiting to say his next lines all though it. Filmed in Mexico for a rich Mexican who wanted to make a movie of Delon for his father?Alain has moved into his Senior Years. He still doesn't look bad for his age. He too has added a little weight. The title is from a Cole Porter number, with or without permission.",1405296000,,581,4.290909090909091

8079351,4,B000ARXFFK,"Lousy sound DVD. But the film is very good and interesting. Good dialog, good acting; mature Delon looks and acts fabulously!",1356566400,,125,5.0
8079352,5,B000ARXFFK,"This film is not for everybody. Only for those who really enjoy very very bad films. So bad that it becomes enjoyable... If you are among these happy people, well do not miss this one. It is almost without any doubt the worst film ever made. Every other film you could think of (and I know there are plenty) can't compare to this. An absolute must directed by someone who was just offerd his first movie camera for his seventh birthday and acted by stars who probably keep wondering what they're doing in this movie. You have to watch it to believe it.
The only redeeming point is the gorgeous music by Maurice Jarre (but if you kow his work you will soon realize that instead of creatrin a whole new score he merely used a work composed for an older film).

Don't miss it and if possible watch the French version...",1286323200,3,816,4.368421052631579
8079353,1,B000ARXFFK,"This DVD is made from a VHS transfer, so apart from the poor quality of picture, the sound is very bad. The subtitles are a bit helpful, but as the color is white, often they are invisible on white background. There are several times when the VHS tape, from which the transfer is made, is not smooth, so there are white horizontal lines running on the screen. These faults make this disappointing movie worse. I have no idea what the director/writer had in mind for this project, but the story doesn't work at all. It's about an ageing writer, lives in exile in Mexico, who finds again in a visiting young model, the love he had 30 years ago. ""You annoy everyone with your balloons"", says Marianne Denicourt. She is right. When the story fails, sometimes the art helps; but sadly it's Bernard-Henri Lvy instead of Luchino Visconti.",1250121600,4,831,4.621621621621622
8079354,1,B000ARXFFK,"Another late career Alain Delon title to avoid!  The transfer onto DVD is very poor, with uneven lighting, bizarre casting (Lauren Bacall as an American who speaks unaccented, finishing school French!), and a very scruffy, unattractive looking Alain Delon. There is a convoluted plot involving an aspiring model and her manager who come to a Mexican island, and she hooks up with Delon, and receives unlistened-to advice from Bacall.  There is gratuitous nudity (mainly the two younger women in the film) including a strangely shot love scene between the model and Delon.  Very talky, and ultimately forgettable.  Oh yeah - did I mention Delon's character has a hot air balloon on his roof?  Do you care?  This would NOT be recommended for inclusion in an Alain Delon film festival!!  Save your money!!",1219190400,,802,5.03030303030303
