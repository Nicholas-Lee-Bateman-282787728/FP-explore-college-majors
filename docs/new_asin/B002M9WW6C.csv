8373703,4,B002M9WW6C,"I never realized that Michelle was so multi talented and also a plan real gorgeous woman who played a great Actress sexy singer and singing artist......traveling America in less that the comfyiest situations with just 2 brothers.
  Bridges was also a real compliment Michelle,
 His art is great and also was fantastic for the role he played.
 Without him this movie would not been what it was.

I have a feeling this is going to be a keeper for years to come and you get one more CD free with this package.",1381968000,,506,4.456521739130435
8373704,5,B002M9WW6C,The Love Field was a surprise hit for me.  Michelle was a perfect dumb blonde with a heart of gold.,1370476800,,99,3.95
8373705,3,B002M9WW6C,"Visual fine and audio good. However, one disc didn't have any i.d. (title, studio, etc.), just blank. Worth it for the price, however.",1369440000,,134,4.869565217391305
8373706,3,B002M9WW6C,"My motive for buying this collection of movies was because it included the movie, The Russia House. The three movies with Michelle Pfeiffer were alright, but not her best movies. The DVDs arrive in good condition, and as scheduled. I would recommend purchasing the movie, ""The Russia House"".",1359072000,,291,5.083333333333333
8373707,4,B002M9WW6C,"For less than the going price of the single DVD of Russia House, 4 excellent movies.  Watching all 4 performances in a short time period gave me an even better appreciation of her great talent.",1354406400,,193,4.514285714285714
8373708,5,B002M9WW6C,"For the under 35 crowd,I suppose Angelina Jolie is the number one box office actress, for those of us around back in the 80's it was the beautiful and oh so talented Michelle Pfeiffer!! Think back to the movie ""Scareface"" could any other actress have played that part better?. I can't think of one, since I really thought she WAS that charecter-- she played it so well!!!. This box set doesn't contain Scarface,you won't be dissapointed if you admire her work ,she puts her heart and soul into everything she does!!.",1293580800,9,516,4.681318681318682
