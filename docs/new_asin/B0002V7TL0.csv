8032622,2,B0002V7TL0,"THe book is terrific but the movie feels like a not well done telenovela, every scene is about a dramatic cry. Feels like a movie for little kids. THe story is in itself a lesson but the movie is not. Good photography but as a movie it looks like a the pieces of a one year telenovela cut in pieces. THere are better Chilean movies, this is not one of them.",1160265600,5,357,4.042253521126761
