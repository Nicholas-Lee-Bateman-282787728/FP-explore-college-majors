6477757,5,B00L9IR2LM,"I loved it, especially the Direction by DePrez......Bruce Barron was very courageous and quite an adventurer.  I highly recommend ""Amazonia......""",1363219200,,146,6.3

6477759,3,B00L9IR2LM,"I couldn't help but think I was watching the Life Aquatic with Steve Zisu.  Did these guys really think they were the first people to ""find"" the headwaters of this river?  That's laughable.",1515715200,,189,4.696969696969697
6477760,5,B00L9IR2LM,It's always interesting to see why people do what they do. To go where no man has gone before. A film about the true spirit of adventure!,1515196800,,137,4.111111111111111
6477761,4,B00L9IR2LM,Interesting and well told story.,1515024000,,32,5.6
6477762,5,B00L9IR2LM,I really enjoyed this documentary....some very scary intense situations.  I was impressed with the crew for sticking it out.,1514851200,,124,5.526315789473684
6477763,5,B00L9IR2LM,"A 6 star adventure, i enjoyed every minute. I found it amazing to see how some characters act or ""are"" in a certain way in the beggining and then you see them mature and evolve through the whole expedition. An unexpected very enjoyable film/documentary",1514678400,2,252,4.75
6477764,5,B00L9IR2LM,I'm so glad I watched this movie. It is compelling in every way. No Hollywood hocus-pocus. Real men doing something they love to do. If you love nature and the outdoors this movie is a must. It was great to see how the team bonded on the journey. Excellent.,1514592000,,257,4.26530612244898
6477765,5,B00L9IR2LM,I enjoyed watching this group's trek though the jungle.  I am amazed and intrigued.  Anyone who watches this will be envious of the adventure.  12/28/2017,1514419200,,154,5.08
6477766,3,B00L9IR2LM,"I think most negative reviews about the two main guys are from people who didn't watch the entire film, or people who don't like Caucasians to begin with. Most comments have the theme of white westerners not having respect for the natives or their crew members. If you watch the film to its conclusion you find they shared a deep bond with the crew and it felt genuinely reciprocated. I found it interesting how one of the crew members, who was a native Amazonian, was the only crew member to go near all the way up the Heath headwaters with Bruce and Marshall to this mystical and distinguishable tree, which signaled to him the location of the ""origins of his people."" The area was sacred, but forbidden, and he wouldn't continue any further. His motivation for going that far upriver was to see the area once in his life. This is another example of how the crew was in it for adventure as well and they weren't just paid porters. They were made up of a botanist, a translator, a biologist and two were native Amazonian guides. The rest of the crew were their ""river support"" which left the expedition when they disembarked from the main river. As can be seen from actually watching the film Bruce and Marshall had great respect for the guys and this was obvious. In other words- if you had a problem with these guys you most likely want to have a problem with them. As an American I thought they represented our people with the warmth and generosity. When Chando wanted to leave two of his crew behind, it was Bruce and Marshall who made him go back and find them. With that said, I give the film 3 stars because it was interesting, but not truly captivating. It's not the kind of film that makes you want to watch it again. It's basically a river expedition that gives you an idea of where Percy Fawcett went in the Amazon. The film helps you visualize what he did and what he encountered however, the film doesn't help you grasp what's at the heart of the Fawcett story like the movie -The Lost City of Z- does. There is more to that story than just a jungle adventure. It is the era, the siren call of the unknown, the mystery and a tragic end that only our imaginations can create.",1514419200,3,2188,4.404938271604938
6477767,5,B00L9IR2LM,Excellent adventure; excellent film. Happy they made it.,1514073600,,56,6.125
6477768,5,B00L9IR2LM,"It was much better than I expected. Really loved it, all the people on the expedition, except you-will-find-out. Marshall's determination and positive energy was infectious, and Bruce's equanimity in dealing with the different problems and personalities as things were getting very dicey was amazing- I'd say these men owe their lives to him. Plus, how cool is the whole 'find the source' thing, anyway? Great exploration film.",1513987200,,427,5.388059701492537
6477769,5,B00L9IR2LM,"Great adventure, enjoyed watching.",1513814400,,34,7.75
6477770,5,B00L9IR2LM,"Real life adventure, very exciting! We weren't sure at first, but as the movie progressed we got involved as if we were there! We were not disappointed.",1513814400,,152,4.666666666666667
6477771,5,B00L9IR2LM,Inspirational for sure. Archaeology and exploration fascinate me and I recommended this to my little brother that's about to embark on a career like this. I'm hoping to live vicariously through him.,1512000000,,198,5.21875
6477772,5,B00L9IR2LM,It is a nice documentary but I give more points to the native guys than the white dudes. All the documentary I was thinking are those people were getting paid really well? Because at the end they were the ones doing the hunt and even cocking and carry all the heavy stuff. So at the end the native guys are the mean characters to me. To my point of view.,1511568000,,354,4.071428571428571
6477773,1,B00L9IR2LM,"The LAST thing one does when going through tough jungle is hack everything in sight with a machete. That'll wear you out! Amateurs!

6477774,4,B00L9IR2LM,"Fascinating footage of South America, and an interesting story.

At times I wondered if this was going to be a fake reality-show, e.g., presented as a reality-show, but really fiction.  I wonder how true it is?",1510963200,,210,4.805555555555555

6477777,4,B00L9IR2LM,"Some great images of a world most of us will never see.  I was appalled that they kept mentioning that they wanted to be the first men to reach the source -- like the natives they were so afraid of encountering have never been there?  Also some wise tips can be learned: check your supplies yourself before you head out, conference with the group to make sure everyone is on the same page before leaving and at intervals en route. Ah well, there wouldn't have been as much drama.",1509840000,2,479,4.370786516853933
6477778,2,B00L9IR2LM,"Rank amateurs compared to Percy Fawcett and his son, Jack.  But they had a guy that was smart and a guy that was tough and determined.  Gotta give em some credit.",1508889600,,162,4.193548387096774
6477779,5,B00L9IR2LM,That was something. Hard to believe a whole river can spring from a trickle of a water bubbling up out of the ground. Well worth watching. What tremendous challenges they went through. Moral of the story: Never trust the word of anyone. Always take inventory YOURSELF before leaving on an exploration. They overcame and kept going and lived to tell it all. I have noted that it is always more satisfying when looking back on an adventure than actually experiencing the adventure.,1508716800,,479,4.853658536585366
6477780,5,B00L9IR2LM,"If you love to travel off the beaten path.  If you love adventures instead of vacations.  You will love this movie.  They took risks and physically suffered to get to the ""finish line"".  But in all accomplishments, it is the satisfaction of finishing that is the reward.  Don't get me wrong, the scenery and wildlife is interesting and beautiful.  If you like all these things, you will enjoy this movie.  Wild Kingdom and National Geographic at its best.",1507852800,3,455,4.756410256410256

6477784,5,B00L9IR2LM,"This was an amazing film!  Marshall is an inspiration to all.  His ability to block out everything except the end goal is the key to everyone's personal success. Thanks guys for showing showing everyone that determination and perseverance always wins.

6477785,4,B00L9IR2LM,"Worth watching.  Notice at one point, the blond guy who funds the expedition says, ""if I had to do this again, I would take a helicopter in.""  Although they mention numerous times that they were hundreds of miles from any rescue,  Puerto Maldonado, population about 40,000, with flights to Cuzco, is about 100 miles.  Why they planned the expedition from Cuzco, by truck, and with so many people, and so much equipment, is questionable.  How would you have planned the trip?  Why not charter a flight from Puerto Maldonado, or La Paz (maybe a float plane, or helicopter)?  Have the  float plane/helicopter drop you near the spot they started hiking upstream, without the boats (the section of the Heath River that was unexplored).  Schedule a pick up at the same spot sometime later.  If you wanted a rafting adventure also,  you could have rafts dropped, and schedule a pick up downstream.  The Heath River is the border of Bolivia, and Peru - the area they explored can be found on Google Maps in a few minutes (notice the numerous problems caused by the other maps they used).  The Heath branches off into many small tributaries towards its head (as with almost all streams, there is not one source).",1507248000,4,1203,4.725961538461538
6477786,5,B00L9IR2LM,This was an excellent real life experience of the ultimate adventure in nature's most dense and diverse rainforest. To really appreciate this documentary one should watch ' The Lost City of Z ' and read the biography of Colonel Percival 'Percy' Fawcett. Very few people can or are willing risk their life doing what they did because it takes a person of great determination and endurance to accomplished such an extreme and unique adventure. Another film that would enhance anyone's appreciation for the Amazon Rainforest is ' The Emerald Forest' (1985).,1505952000,,554,5.0989010989010985
6477787,5,B00L9IR2LM,"This film documentary was excellent in content and storyline.  Percy Fawcett had a dream of exploring for a lost city in one of my most unexplored places on the planet.  These men/women who started on this grand adventure were taxed to their fears and limits.... but two (Bruce and Marshall) were the ones who finally found the source of the Heath River that Percy never got to finish.  I feel I am capable of adventure, but in this case these explorers were beyond my capabilities...... this is why they are special and were able to survive under extreme conditions.  KUDOS!",1505952000,,575,4.72
6477788,5,B00L9IR2LM,I also watched The Lost City of Z first and agree this Documentary enhanced the movie experience. I highly recommend both! Bravo!,1505779200,,129,4.909090909090909

6477790,5,B00L9IR2LM,Magnificent video.....I enjoyed every minute of it. I had just watched Lost City of Z before this and it just topped it off. Hats off to all of the people on this expedition.,1505606400,4,174,4.303030303030303
6477791,5,B00L9IR2LM,"I understand armchair reviewers challenging these explorers, their ideals, egos, and claims...however, they did a great job sharing their story; a story more courageous and adventurous than most. It was certainly entertaining. Miraculously (spoiler alert) no one died. Giving it less than 4 or 5 stars is simply revealing one's lack of appreciation for being in the great outdoors, going for adventure, and determinedly pushing through toward a shared goal. I'm glad I got to watch it.",1505347200,12,485,5.311688311688312
6477792,5,B00L9IR2LM,I liked it.. great adventure and story.. makes my little adventures seem lacking .. maybe one of these days.. but I don't have a camera man all solo filmed,1504656000,4,155,4.379310344827586

6477795,3,B00L9IR2LM,"It would have been better if the two main characters hadn't spent so much time talking about how special they were.  If they had just filmed the journey and let other people make draw their own conclusions it would have been much better.

It also needed a lot more explanation of Fawcett, who was controversial because he was actually pretty incompetent at what he did (Despite Amazon's Lost City of Z).  More history would have made it better.",1501718400,3,444,4.666666666666667
6477796,3,B00L9IR2LM,"As someone else commented, this is more like reality TV than it is like reality. These guys are full of themselves. I suppose that's OK, after all they did go on this adventure. But it seems to be more about this duo sitting in comfy chairs talking about the trip than about the trip. And over and over they go on about being the first ones to find the headwaters of this river. What about the people who live there? Lots of people have been there, just not so many white guys with money. I'd have liked it better, I suppose, if they had approached it as admitted outsiders who want to not only find out where this river begins, but also find out about the people on the river. ""Hi guys, we know we're uninvited, but we'd really like to find out about you and your lives and where this river goes.""",1498262400,12,798,4.222222222222222

6477804,5,B00L9IR2LM,"This was an excellent account of a genuine adventure.  It wasn't the sort of adventure of fiction, but the sort that is real.  The danger to western eyes in the comfort of civilization seems mild, yet every day was literally life and death on the river.  The rapids, the fauna, the insects, the natives, possible flash floods were all very real dangers.  Just going down an uncharted river where there could be a waterfall is dangerous.  They faced starvation, human frailty, the elements and the limits of their own endurance...with no rescue available.  One slip on the rocks...one bad turn on the rapids...and you are in the wilderness with a broken bone and no aid but what your group can do for you.  No doctors, no police, no rescue.
