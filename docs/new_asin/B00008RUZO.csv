1861325,2,B00008RUZO,"While I did sweat some during this workout, I think it was more from laughing than working. I don't think the warm up was adequate and whenever she mentions to breathe it is more of an afterthought than an instruction. I've taken a yogalates class for 8 months and thought this would be a good video to do now that I can't take the class. I was wrong. I wouldn't recommend this video to the beginner or anyone looking for a good yoga workout.",1062374400,3,442,4.273809523809524

1861380,3,B00008RUZO,"I got this DVD used and, although I can imagine it's a wonderful workout for some, I couldn't keep up with it. I do yoga off and on. I had never tried Pilates. An I used to do ballet.

This DVD is a CHALLENGE for a beginner. I had wished one of the backup work out people would do modified poses, like other yoga DVDs I have and love. (Rodney Yee, for example, is one of my favorites.)

Other people have said she's too chatty, which is true sometimes when I just want to use a pose to focus on my body and breathing, but a lot of her tips are useful.

WHY I GAVE IT THREE STARS: THE WALL. No where in my apartment do I have a free wall that provides access to watching the TV while leaning against it. In fact, I don't think I've ever loved in a place with that. Although a sturdy chair works for a lot of the wall exercises, the wall-sit had to be modified greatly to get a similar stretch.

If you are a beginner, I would go in a different direction. But if you've done Pilates before, I'm sure you'd find some benefit to this DVD. I may watch it a few more times to try to build some endurance, but I have a feeling it will get tedious pretty quickly.",1375228800,,1155,3.987012987012987

1861382,5,B00008RUZO,"I am an intermediate level exerciser.  I really like this video as a change of pace from most of Denise's others.  It challenges your legs and core and you really need to focus on balance.  In addition there is a 2 minute sequence of plank poses that really tones the arms.  A great video to really focus on your body and tone without punishing.  Also, I like the ending with fun dance moves.",1359072000,2,392,4.315068493150685
1861383,4,B00008RUZO,"I'm a 31 year old female. I work out pretty hard 4-5 days a week. Sometimes, if I'm having a rough week, I really like this video to unwind and just get the blood flowing, without sweating my toosh off. It's very easy to follow Denise Austin, as she goes through the dvd. This is a mellow work out that I think is a great addition to anyone's collection.",1327276800,,354,4.144927536231884
1861404,5,B00008RUZO,"This workout is a great blend of stretching, breathing, yoga, standing pilates, and smooth motions to make your whole body feel energized and gently worked out.  It's low-impact so it won't hurt any joints.

The setting (kind of looks like an ancient cave) and the music are soothing and fit well with the mood of the workout.  Denise's narrating/cueing is good, and I like her happy words of encouragement and positivity.

The length of the workout is just right.  And you can't beat the price.  Definitely worth a try if you like Denise Austin, and are looking for a gentle energizing workout.",1325894400,3,595,4.784313725490196
1861405,5,B00008RUZO,"This is my favorite workout video. I am not in great shape by any stretch of the imagination, and this workout is something I can do. The best part is that the exercises in this workout are incredible for relieving lower back pain. After doing this workout in the morning, my back feels amazing all day long.

Unfortunately, I have this on VHS and my VCR just quit, so I'm going to have to buy it again, on DVD this time.",1311897600,,421,4.197530864197531
1861406,5,B00008RUZO,I had this video a while back and loved the standing pilates and dance segements.  I only had a vhs so needless to say I needed to get a dvd so I could even play it. It arrived quickly and just as described. Great deal and a great workout.,1301011200,,239,3.877551020408163
1861407,1,B00008RUZO,"The environment/space/background is hideous.  It is very distracting. Dim to dark, fake rocks/stones, just plain fakey and ugly.  The bar/fake place she uses to steady herself for the workouts that normally use a chair, etc., is also very ugly and it is just so dim.  The workouts are NOT as described.  I have purchased several Denise Austin's workouts and after trying them once usually donate them to Goodwill as I have not been satisfied with any of them.  I have continued to try her workouts, because of the good reviews I read.  I have now decided that I am going to have to SEE the workout DVDs I purchase before I buy another one, as I do like to have a variety.  I have finally decided that the good reviews come from persons who have not tried any of the better work out DVDs as there are several (Petra for one) who do a much better job than Denise does and the space they use for the workout is much more pleasant than Denise's choices.  Denise is very over rated in my opinion.",1299456000,,991,4.377049180327869
1861408,5,B00008RUZO,"I've been using this workout since 2006 & I absolutely love it. It's not too difficult, but I feel it has been an effective workout for me. I use it daily & I love it.",1296000000,2,167,3.8
1861409,5,B00008RUZO,"I've been practicing yoga off and on for a while, but I had a copy of this DVD quite some time ago (in my late teens). I was a bit ""bored"" with the routine at the time, but lately have begun to appreciate it a lot more (I am currently 24). I've had quite-inflexible muscles and limbs in the past. I've gotten more flexible over the past year or so, and have recently begun to really enjoy this DVD.

It would make a great complement to a cardio-type of DVD workout -- I like that the pilates routine in this DVD engages the abs throughout (one of my favourite ""body parts"" to work). I used to hate stretching in the past (because I was so bad at it, lol!)...but after quite a lot of effort...I've finally begun to see some improvement in that department. So in my experience, a very inflexible person might want to keep in mind that stretching should be done in progression very slowly (if not, you might get irritated trying to follow Denise Austin's poses and etc, like the warrior pose -- I couldn't go very low down on that pose at first, though I can with no problem nowadays).",1291680000,,1082,4.303921568627451

1861411,5,B00008RUZO,"This is such an awesome workout DVD! I love the variety that Denise Austin packs into this workout! The combination of yoga, standing pilates and dance moves is not only fun but makes me feel so alive that I can't wait to exercise again!",1285027200,,237,4.409090909090909
1861412,4,B00008RUZO,"I liked this video very much.  It has nice componets of yoga, pilates and dance.  I soon found myself feel very relaxed in mind as I was doing the exercises.  I normally don't enjoy pilates that much but I found the standing pilates in this video to be very relaxing and soothing to the mind.  Much of it is the same exercises you would do in ballet. Maybe that is why I felt relaxed. I remember doing leg exercises in ballet and it being a workout but calming for the mind.

The dance segment was very enjoyable, fun and flowing.  It came at the end of the workout. The only thing I'd change is for it to come first...as yoga and pilates, to me, are relaxing and more suitable after a dance workout.

If you have a small space to work out in...you may have to maneuver yourself to do the exercises.  For the wall exercises I had to use a door (no wall space available) and for the standing pilates I had to work to find a piece of furniture to grab onto to do it.

But it worked out and I felt very very good after this workout.",1276819200,2,1029,4.105
1861413,5,B00008RUZO,Denise is just phenomenal.  What a role model and beautiful person.  You feel as if she is just working out with only you.  Another great workout!,1265846400,,146,4.538461538461538
1861424,2,B00008RUZO,"This workout was a mashup of different styles that I didn't think went together well. The standing pilates section was fine but what came after just didn't go well.
In addition to that I didn't enjoy all the talking that Denise Austin did. I haven't watched her more recent work so I can't say that she is still this way.
I also didn't find it very challenging as a workout but I do a good amount of strength training and mat pilates.
This workout tried to combine strength and cardio and did so unsuccessfully. For cardio I much prefer a Dancing with the Stars workouts. So perhaps you can use that to evaluate my biases. For Pilates I like Windsor and the GAIAM videos",1260316800,,670,4.411290322580645

1861426,5,B00008RUZO,"There are not enough exercise dvds out there that give a decent workout without focusing so much on weight loss and fat loss. Most of Denise's dvds have ""blast off fat"" in the titles. This one is a nice departure from that. She never says anything about burning or toning. If she does, it is very little and mostly unnoticable.
For those of us who want to work out and break a little sweat with a dvd but are recovering from a bad body image, this dvd could work.",1231286400,4,463,4.213483146067416
1861427,4,B00008RUZO,"I love the exercise routine in this DVD. At the end, I feel that my body is relaxed and strong, my posture is graceful, and my abs are exercised. The set and music are cheesy, but I am using it to work out, not to have a Hollywood movie experience!",1231027200,,248,3.98
1861428,4,B00008RUZO,I have been doing this workout for about 2 years now - I do this one usually on Fridays when I am tired and need to stretch and still get a workout in.  I own many Denise workouts and like all of them including this one.  It is not super difficult - just different.  You do not have to kill yourself to get a good workout!!,1197590400,2,323,3.8636363636363638
1861429,5,B00008RUZO,I have been doing this workout for over a year.  I am in my fifties and exercise four or more days per week. I tend to do it about twice a  week.  It makes me feel very flexible and improves my balance.  I love the standing pilates-very efficient!  I also love a work out that feels more like fun than work and this is it.  I have purchased several for gifts.,1195171200,3,359,3.9859154929577465
1861430,5,B00008RUZO,"I have 4 of her tapes(Yoga Buns,Pilates for Everybody, and Power Yoga/Pilates,  that I rotate with Rodney Yee. This tape uses yoga stretching, standing pilates( basically all the things you do on the mat, you do standing),a bit of ballet, and a dance type sequence at the end.  I found it had that cardio component in it that was different from my other tapes.  I like to use her tapes due to her positive attitude.  If you don't like alot of chatter, then don't do her tapes as this is her personality.",1174608000,3,503,4.434782608695652
1861431,4,B00008RUZO,"I'm slender but not fit. I bought this DVD upon its debut and have used it on and off for the past 3 years. This DVD is great for easing you in to a fitness regimen. It's not tough, although it has its moments. There's a point where she has you do lunges, wall sits, and yoga lifts but there are  few repetitions. Thus it feels like an introduction to what you should aspire to when you are ready for the next level. Overall, it's a great DVD to loosen up your tight joints and to be able to feel your toes again. As for her presentation, I enjoy her positivity because I really hate working out.",1173225600,3,596,4.094017094017094
1861432,4,B00008RUZO,"I think that Denise Austin fans will find this video to be a little bit different from her other videos, but in a good way. This video combines some yoga, standing pilates and ends with a fun little 10-minute dance workout just to loosen you up. This video is good for those days when you want to exercise but you're just not up for traditional cardio or toning routines. A good ""rainy day"" video!

I would also like to add that I'm very surprised by all the comments that I've read about Denise being ""annoying."" She doesn't annoy me at all. I have videos from other instructors but I still find her to be my favorite. Anyway, this is agood alternative workout to add to your collection.",1153094400,5,688,4.417322834645669
1861433,3,B00008RUZO,"Denise Austin has motivated me to make exercising a habit, although I expected a bit more of a workout from this DVD.

Nonetheless, I have wimped out of a few other workouts when I just haven't felt up to a strenuous aerobic session or don't have the energy for an intense, lengthy yoga or pilates session.

MIND: This 10 minute section should really be renamed 'spine'.  It places less emphasis on connecting your mind with your body and more emphasis on stretching your spine.  It uses some Yoga poses; if you practice yoga you should recognise poses such as Warrior 2, Triangle, Balancing Stick and Pose of the Dancer.

BODY - 1: This is the first of two 10 minutes segments of 'Standing Pilates'.  This is what it sounds like, taking classical Pilates matwork and transposing them to be executed while standing.  Most of the exercises are straightforward, although there are some challenging exercises in plank towards the end of the 10 minute segment.

BODY - 2: The second 10 minute Standing Pilates segment involves the assistance of a wall that you use for balance.  Firstly you use the wall for balance while you do one legged exercises like leg circles, leg kicks and leg beats.  Then, you use the wall for strength exercises such as wall squats and wall pushups.

SOUL: This 10 minute segment is a salsa-inspired dance segment, that was less effective as cardio but more effective as a cool down.  I certainly didn't appreciate the cameraman's obsession with Denise Austin's stomach during the hula segment, talk about rubbing it in, argh!

Denise is her enthusiastic self, although I am not a huge fan of the carribbean/very fake leafy palm tree set, and one thing that I noticed was that the music played in the background was recycled from Denise Austin's other DVD, 'Fat Blasting Yoga'.  Jeez, was it really that difficult to find a new music track to play in the background?

All in all, I am glad that I purchased this DVD, although it is not something that I could use regularly since it does not provide enough of a challenge or room for development.  It is something that I'll use when I'm a bit down in the dumps or had a rough day.  I would not recommend it for people who are looking for one all-purpose workout, but I would recommend it for people who want to do something different some days of the week.",1119744000,11,2329,4.627737226277373
1861444,4,B00008RUZO,"I love Denise Austin. She is very motivating and I enjoy her talk thoughout the video. She does get cheesy at times, but for some reason I am not put off by it.
That being said, this workout won't really get you sweating, but it does tone and make you feel better after you do it.

This video features a lot of relaxing stretching, some floor pilates, a lot of standing pilates, some ballet work with a chair and a wall and some dancy cardio at the end. It is approx 40 minutes long. It is not a terribly hard workout but a relaxing workout that will help you tone.",1109289600,10,565,4.136363636363637
1861445,2,B00008RUZO,"For someone who has been a couch potato for the last couple of years - I wanted to get back into shape. I heard about Pilates and wanted to try a DVD, but also get some aerobics in as well.  The concept of this video was good (mixing yoga, pilates and a little dance) but for the price - way too short and way too easy.  In about 3 sessions I could complete the full workout and was often bored by the time the ""Soul"" part came on.

I am used to Denise's ""enthusiasm"" so she did not bother me in that way.

All in all - good DVD if you are REALLY out of shape and want to get started/",1104278400,6,584,3.8016528925619837
1861446,4,B00008RUZO,"I have been working out to Denise for over two years and I love what she offers in her videos. Currently, I do her ""Fit & Lite"" and ""Daily Workout"" shows on Lifetime daily, as well as own her ""Mat Workout Based on J.H. Pilates"", ""Power Zone: The Ultimate Metabolism Boosting Workout"", and her Abs workout videos. I am pretty satisfied with those, but Denise's 2003 release of ""Power Zone: Mind, Body, Soul"" video is probably one of my favorites.

The first workout, ""Mind"", is a warm-up that is absolutely great to do in the morning - ""Mind"" is filled with concentrated breathing, slow stretches, and focus on pulling in the abdominals.

The second workout, ""Body"", is a Standing Pilates segment. If you own a video or have ever used the Pilates workouts, these moves should be familiar - the difference is you're standing up while doing it. Sounds strange, but you sure feel the burn more than you would if you were doing them on the floor. This one's terrifc for the abs.

The third workout, ""Soul"", is a salsa-inspired segment - I wouldn't really call it cardio, but it sure gets your heart pumping. It's pretty fun. You really feel this in your torso.

The last workout, ""Spirit"", is a sort of a cool-down; great for doing right before bed. It's a real soother.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this video to someone who just wants ONE fitness video - this video is awesome, but I suggest you get another video to go along with it to get in your essential cardio in.",1104019200,12,1468,4.545454545454546
1861447,4,B00008RUZO,"Denise Austin's Mind Body Soul is a 40-minute workout which nicely blends different exercise styles.  It is filmed on an outdoors-y looking set, and Denise works out with two background exercisers.  The first section, Mind, begins with a 5-minute warm-up which concentrates on breathing and spine stretches and then moves into an additional 5-minutes of standing yoga postures.  The poses (warrior II, side angle, triangle) flow nicely and include some more challenging balances such as warrior III and dancer.  Denise gives good reminders to focus on your breathing, although she overuses trite phrases such as ""your spine is your life line.""

The middle segment, Body, consists of Pilates movements performed mostly in a standing position.  In the first 10 minutes, you will replicate Pilates matwork moves such as single leg stretch, criss-cross, double leg stretch, spine stretch, and saw, all while standing erect.  However, you will also perform some challenging plank work from a push-up position on the floor.  The following 10 minutes require the assistance of a wall.  Initially, the wall is used for support during 1-legged moves such as leg kicks, leg circles, rear kicks, and heel beats.  Next, the wall is used for some strength moves, including a wall squat, a triceps isometric exercise, and wall push-ups.  Throughout this section, Denise repeatedly reminds you to ""zip up"" your abdominal area so that you really feel the work in your midsection.

The final section of this video, Soul, was a 10-minute dance-type stretch.  The exercises performed included mambos, lunges, and additional warrior poses, but the moves seemed to serve as more of a cool-down function rather than cardio or toning.  This was my least favorite section of the video; it may have worked better if the Mind and Soul segments had been reversed.  Overall, however, I found this to be an enjoyable workout for light toning and general stretching.  Denise's personality is a bit more subdued than usual here, and because the workout moves slowly, I found her much easier to follow than in her aerobic workouts.",1096848000,33,2099,5.147492625368732
1861448,3,B00008RUZO,"As much as I like Denise Austin's workouts, I have come to believe that she is too hyperactive for yoga.  I am returning her MIND, BODY, SOUL DVD, and here is why: I wanted a slow paced, meditative session of yoga, with rhythmical breathing and sustained stretches.  This is aerobics and gesticulation.  The theatrics of the cavernous decor did not deceive me.  Autin addresses the mind with quick stretches and the soul with disco dancing antics.  I can do as much addressing the mind without Austin's help.  And if getting loose is her version of exploring the soul, there are some clubs I can go to, or salsa music I can play at home.  What Austin handles like no one is the body, so I'll keep the other videos I have of her.  She is tough, she is fun, she is entertaining.  But she is no yoga instructor.  So I would like to say to her:  Denise, either you take some valerian before you do a yoga program,  or you leave the yoga to someone who will not mind stretching and stay silent for more than two seconds.  And no more deceptive titles, please.",1092528000,9,1054,4.371134020618556

I have ""advanced"" to some of Denise's fat-blasting tapes, but I still do this one several times a week.  Excellent for lower back strength and flexibility!",1081814400,3,457,4.159090909090909

The Power Zone workout is one of my absolute favorites!! I saw it at our local store and grabbed it. Its wonderful! You get a great workout and you feel so relaxed afterwards. I cannot say enough about it. I've let all my friends borrow this DVD trying to get them to buy it because it really does make a difference. I do this workout in conjunction with her Blast Away 10lbs and her Power Kickboxing. I have noticed a difference and my flexibility is amazing.

1861451,5,B00008RUZO,"Power Zone by Denise Austin is a very original workout.  Denise combines yoga postures, pilates, and a cardio aerobic workout to give you a full body workout that connects the mind, body and soul.  At a total of 40 minutes I have found this to be a perfect evening workout video.
Mind-here Denise focuses a lot of breathing and a variety of yoga postures.  This is to relax you and get you prepared for a more dynamic workout to come.  It's a great opener to the DVD!
Body-This is Denise's standing pilates workout.  Standing pilates, your probably wondering what that is.  Denise has modified some of J. H. Pilates workouts so that you can do them from a standing position.  Some of these can be tough but they all work your core just like standard pilates.  This is a great core workout.
Soul-Denise finishes her program with a little salsa dancing routine that will pickup your heart rate but not stress you out.  This section might be a little difficult to follow at first but stick with it.  It's worth it and is really fun but most importantly completes the full body workout.
I highly recommend this DVD from Denise.  It's one of my favorite programs now and one I like to do 2-3 times a week.  It truly is a great for in the morning to help wake you up or in my case in the evening to unwind you from a stressful day.  5 Stars!",1063152000,16,1335,4.3562753036437245
