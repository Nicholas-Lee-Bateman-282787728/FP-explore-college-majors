7548441,5,B018HLMB3C,"5 stars!!!!! This workout is amazing, hands down BEST pre-natal video on the market!!
Not only has this kept me in shape, I believe it is the reason I haven't gained ANY extra pregnancy weight yet and I am at 6 months :)
Love Christina El Moussa and a HUGE fan of Flip or Flop!! Hoping she will come out with more workout videos, possibly a post-natal/new Mommy vid in the future!!! Buy this, you will LOVE IT!!!",1452124800,8,412,4.294871794871795
7548442,5,B018HLMB3C,"Best prenatal workout I've done in my 4 pregnancies. While it's called yoga, it works every muscle in my body without causing harm to the baby.",1451865600,3,143,4.538461538461538
7548443,5,B018HLMB3C,Such a great prenatal yoga dvd! Christina is awesome and I reccomend to all the mommies out there who wanna stay fit!,1451692800,2,117,4.363636363636363
7548444,5,B018HLMB3C,"This prenatal yoga video is great, even for people who are not pregnant! Challenging but fun, Christina has a great energy and charisma that she shows both in Flip or Flop and in this DVD. Love it!",1450310400,7,197,4.351351351351352
8742358,3,B018HLMB3C,The yoga was a little too easy and there were moments where I'm laying down on the ground doing nothing.,1528416000,,104,4.25
8742359,2,B018HLMB3C,"I was shocked how little of a workout it really was. I read prior reviews before buying and thought I had finically found a real workout DVD for pregnancy, which is so hard to do. This wasn't the case. It was a GREAT stretching yoga dvd and if thats what you're looking for I really do recommend, but if you're looking for a workout this is far from it. They did one chair pose and a few push ups, but that was it.",1518307200,,414,4.0
8742360,5,B018HLMB3C,"My first and favorite prenatal workout video. I started doing this around week 13 and now I'm in week 21. I do this at least three times a week and feel awesome when I do! I think it's helped with the little aches and pains of pregnancy. It targets every area of the body and as another reviewer said, it's intense without being too intense. One thing that sets it apart from other videos is that there's an arms segment that works your triceps going in and out of dips/downward dog. There's balancing to help with the center of gravity, stretching, hip openers... I finish the routine feeling like I just did something really great for myself. The other thing I like is that the way the routine is set up in segments, it didn't take long for me to basically memorize the steps, and so if I want to do yoga on the beach or where there's no DVD player, I can easily do a great yoga session with just myself and a mat. I wish there were a postnatal follow up DVD I could use after pregnancy!",1489190400,,989,4.238095238095238
8742361,1,B018HLMB3C,i didn't love it like the other reviews have said. Its just one workout for $20 which I think is too much. then last half of the video is just you lying on your side. I wonder if I can return after I've already watched it.,1483660800,,222,3.847826086956522
8742362,5,B018HLMB3C,I was only able to get through 30 min of this workout but wow I woke up the next morning and my muscles felt sore like I did a hr in the gym. I would highly recommend if your looking for a workout that wil work you out! I'm going to keep working my way up but good job Christina this workout ain't no joke. Any mama can appreciate this.,1469577600,,336,3.8142857142857145
8742363,1,B018HLMB3C,DVD didn't work when I received it. There were scratches. I returned it and bout from a different site.,1465171200,2,103,4.473684210526316
8742364,1,B018HLMB3C,The end/cool down is literally 5 minutes of video of the women laying on the ground.,1458950400,2,84,4.3125
8742365,4,B018HLMB3C,I really like this yoga video. It has quite a bit of strength segments included. The only thing I didn't like is some of the stretching at the end don't show any alternatives to the stretches for someone like myself that is not very flexible.,1458259200,,242,4.4
8742366,5,B018HLMB3C,"This is a really great prenatal workout! It's not just glorified stretching. It's intense without being too much. Just the right amount for a mommy-to-be. The beginning has a series of chat stings push-ups using your knees (so as not to put too much pressure on your core), which are challenging. Then you move into long sets of chair pose on the walk and finish with long standing poses such as warrior, side, angle, etc. I definitely feel the burn the next day in my arms! I definitely recommend!",1455926400,6,498,4.606741573033708
8742367,1,B018HLMB3C,"This DVD is a total waste of money. She says stupid catch phrases like ""yay do it like me, or don't do it at all"" and ""stick it between my sticky buns"" that really grossed me out thinking about sweaty butt.  Basically in a nutshell,  it's a soft-core pornagraphy dvd. I threw it in the garbage and my teenage son dug it out. Now I find stiff socks under his bed. If it's flip or flop. I call this one a flop.",1454112000,11,408,3.9634146341463414
