Parts of the audio was distorted. It was the beginning of Sherlock Holmes and I must say this is sacred  ground for all that followed. Enjoy.

8022099,1,B00024JBP4,"Don't waste your money.  The ad for this junk is mis-leading.  It is advertised as THE SLEEPING CARDINAL, which is the original British title.  However, this one is  titled SHERLOCK HOLMES' FATAL HOUR, the American release title.  Further, the picture quality is VERY poor.  It falls into the category older 16 MM film collectors used to call ""basement dupe"".  Picture quality is fuzzy and contrasty, with poor sound.  I already have FATAL HOUR but thought it would be nice to have the original title.  Not so fast, Sherlock!  I was hood-winked, as you will be if you ignore my warning.  To compound matters, my copy of FATAL HOUR has excellent picture and sound.  It is a Synergy product,",1346630400,,689,4.745762711864407

8022102,2,B00024JBP4,"There is nothing ""Essential"" here, it is the same old Public Domain films that we has seen many times before.  Stick with the MPI resorations.

For those who want to know, this set includes the same old titles:
