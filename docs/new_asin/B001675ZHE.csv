8261281,5,B001675ZHE,"Great TV show,Locations, Stories, Corvette. (beautiful Frost blue, first couple shows a 60' then a 61) Acting is good,sometimes dramatic, but nonetheless good.(I did not grow up in the 60's and I love the show) love the Vette.",1236643200,,226,4.973684210526316
8261282,4,B001675ZHE,I have season one volume one of route 66 and have enjoyed it.  The season one volume two did not interest me because of the idea of taking a 60's tv show and making it letterbox.  I hope this mistake is remedied in season two volume one.  Why fool or fiddle with a good thing?,1210032000,,276,3.981818181818182
