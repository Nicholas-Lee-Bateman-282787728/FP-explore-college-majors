5380884,1,B00A34LX2M,Go see Zero Dark Thirty or read No Easy Day. The producers of this movie are shameful. Don't waste your money.,1356480000,11,110,4.285714285714286
5380885,5,B00A34LX2M,"This movie is not political in the least....the writer is a republican, just watch a great movie and leave the political arguments for another forum!",1356480000,4,149,5.0
5380886,1,B00A34LX2M,"This movie was rushed out to capitalize on the nation's imagination after Bin Laden's demise, not to mention to compete with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" in the making.  If only it were made by a team of professionals like the ones who executed the raid, this movie would have been a nice addition to the folklore of killing the No. 1 terrorist on earth.  Sadly, the moviemaker didn't even bother to get the real Seal Team Six's gear right.  One example: instead of a standard-issue two-eyepiece night vision goggle, the Seal Team Six in real life is equipped with a custom-made four-eyepiece night vision goggle to enhance the field of vision.  Flaws like this are littered throughout the movie.  It felt pathetic to watch it at times.  For a better depiction of the greatest manhunt, go watch Zero Dark Thirty instead of this one.",1355875200,9,822,4.713286713286713
5380887,5,B00A34LX2M,"Well I'm going to tell you guys about the movie of ""The Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Lade"" I think it's a movie worth the time that has so much action from finding someone and not knowing if your going to get back home to your family. It's a movie that will have you on your toes the whole time while watching. After watching it your going to want to watch it again. It's from CIA agents, to the president, to the seal team six. The movie is about two CIA agents Vivian and Guidry who are played by Kathleen Robertson and William Fitcher who investigate to try and find Osama Bin Laden and when located they have the challenge to try and convince Barack Obama to begin the raid. For that they require the seal team six which are Stunner, Cherry, Trench, Mule, and Sauce. When they begin to use the seal team six that's where more of the action begins. It's really a good action war film that I recommend to anyone that likes action movies or war movies. When I was watching it at times I was thinking to myself no that can't happen and that's why it's such a good movie because you never think that its going to happen. In general I think it's worth watching and all the action will have you at the tip of your toes I say that because sometimes I had to pause the movie because it was so good.",1355097600,3,1301,4.146245059288537
5380888,1,B00A34LX2M,"The reason why this movie is so offensive is because it markets itself as a serious film.  National Geographic fell for a terrible movie by an overtly partisan hack.  Zero Dark Thirty, Mark Owen's book and even the History Channel documentary trump this movie.  This movie is an insult to the real American professionals that conducted the operation and to the intelligence analysts that sacrificed so much for the country.  Horrible movie.",1355011200,25,440,5.069444444444445
5380889,4,B00A34LX2M,"From SAVING PRIVATE RYAN to THE GREAT ESCAPE, I love a good war film. Following the tragic event of 9/11, several films based upon the War On Terror have been made with some notable examples being JARHEAD, THE HURT LOCKER and GREEN ZONE. CODE NAME: GERONIMO is among the strongest of these recent films, with a look at the story behind capturing and killing Bin Laden, both on the front line of combat and the stress within the CIA.  The film deals with the subject in a respectful way whilst still remaining hugely entertaining and exciting (the action scenes are great!)

CODE NAME: GERONIMO is a brilliant war thriller, full of intense action, lots of suspense and tension and with a very strong cast (Freddy Rodriguez and William Fichtner being my favourites). If you're a fan of war movies or thrillers then this is well worth checking out.",1354752000,3,845,4.702702702702703

5380891,2,B00A34LX2M,"If I had to choose one word to describe this movie I would pick superficial.
From the very start it's painfully obvious that this movie was rushed to production for the sole purpose of shamelessly cashing in on one of the biggest events in the last few years. Unfortunately, the acting is shockingly weak, the details sparse, and the directing atrocious. To make matters worse they had to insert numerous political statements instead of just telling the story. Spare yourself the 89 minutes and read the book, or wait for a half way decent movie on the event to come out.",1354320000,13,571,4.663366336633663

5380962,2,B00A34LX2M,"What can you say about this movie aside from a single word: propaganda?

The movie starts with the entirely fallacious notion that (a) US interrogators used psychological tactics rather than crude torture, and (b) some of the information they obtained was actually useful. We know from the record that US interrogators water-boarded detainees and from thousands of interrogations gained precisely zero useful intelligence - though they did spend huge amounts of time & effort chasing down ""leads' provided by brutalized and terrified detainees who would say absolutely anything at all in order to gain some respite from being tortured.

So from the outset we know that this isn't a real account of the hunt for UBL (the real intelligence was gathered remotely, from the fact that there was a large compound under satellite surveillance that had no electronic link to the outside world and whose inhabitants were never seen; followed up by intel from personnel on the ground who were able to confirm it as a probable location of UBL not least because his best-known courier paid visits there). We know, rather, that this is a fictional account of the hunt for UBL that has all the historical and factual veracity of a John Wayne movie. So if you want to fill up on the movie version of patriotic popcorn then go right ahead; but if you want any sense of what really happened, this pathetic charade is a total waste of your time and you'd be better off watching Zero Dark Thirty which, for all its faults, is a slightly more accurate (though still whitewashed) account of the events in question.",1448150400,,1593,4.852941176470588

I was expecting the story about the raid on Abbottabad by the title Navy SEAL team, perhaps dramatized, but at least realistic. Instead, I got a thinly-disguised Obama campaign propaganda piece, with attacks on certain Republicans thrown in to ensure the point.

It tries to throw in interviews with the participants (actual ones, or actors?), dramatizations of what happened before and during the raid, what happened at the CIA with the different people, some infighting among the team members...and ends up with a confusing mishmash. We jump from one thing to another to another to another, but one point is made clear...the real hero is President Obama and his wonderful leadership.

I happened to read the account of the raid in ""The New Yorker"" magazine. Despite the magazine's pro-Obama bias, even that article hardly played up Obama's role in it like this movie did.",1438473600,5,953,4.987421383647798

5380983,3,B00A34LX2M,"I bought this movie because I hadn't seen it before. I had already seen Zero Dark Thirty and bought it at the same time. If you don't know which one to buy and view, I recomend Zero Dark Thirty. More details, more of the real life drama of the hunt for Bin Laden and much less of Obama. Much, much less of Obama and more of the people that really made the search for Bin Laden, their sacrifices and ultimate success, in spite of Obama. The movies are in stark contrast with respect to the shorter length of ST6 compared to ZDT. Given the longer length and larger budget in ZDT there is the advantage of presenting more details and real life drama.
From an online review;
""The latter movie [Seal Team Six] brings with it an unlikely group of players. Directed by John Stockwell (""Tursistas,"" ""Into The Blue,"" ""Crazy/Beautiful""), its biggest names are Cam Gigandet and Xzibit, and unlike Bigelow's two-and-a-half-hour epic, it runs a mere ninety minutes. The picture earned a tiny bit of press and controversy last fall when it was reported that the filmmakers were tweaking the movie to better position President Barack Obama, an argument not helped by the decision to air 'Team Six' on the National Geographic Channel on November 4th, two days before the election. And while it was cut for the TV broadcast, select clips of Mitt Romney and John McCain opposing the hunt for the terrorist leader remain in the home video version. It's a lone partisan moment in an otherwise straight-laced effort.""
""And while the budgets and scope between ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Seal Team Six"" are wildly different, they also overlap in several key areas. Given that both movies will be widely available this week, we thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast the two. But screenwriter Kendall Lampkin, who penned Stockwell's flick, [Seal Team Six] perhaps sums up the key difference best.

5381047,1,B00A34LX2M,"This is supposed to be based on a true story yet this movie follows a plot line that is slightly worse than what I did for my high school Spanish class video. Ok, ok, so they have a terrible plot and script to work with, maybe the actors can pull it out? Nope. Wrong. They're acting is even worse than the shoddy script-job. Like if you were to imagine hiring D-level actors (at best), dressing them up in cool military gear, handing them their lines while a stop watch counts down from 25 seconds, then snatching the lines away and saying ACTION! That would be an improvement to what I saw in this movie. That would actually be better.

[SPOILER ALERT]
So this movie follows SEAL team 6. Which for those of you who don't know, is like the Super team of Navy SEALS. Like they're really hardcore. Yet this movie makes them look like a bunch of 16 year old's fresh out of bootcamp with no concept of the word 'professionals.' In the beginning, they have a mountain pass scene where they're transporting these terrorist insurgents on foot and all of a sudden they take fire and don't know what to do and basically sit there.....kind of shooting back. Bad guys get killed, fights over. Then these 'normal afghans' show up out of nowhere and one of the Navy Seals gets the bright idea to run up to them to check em, even though the fight was over, he really didn't need to, and they could have just left. Surprise its a terrorist and she blows up her vest killing them both.

Like I said, 16 year olds out of bootcamp. Except even they would have probably made out better than these 'Seals.' BUT! This plot device gives the out-of-work writers that were hired for this not-movie (it wasn't even in theaters) a chance to sow bitterness and anger between the characters now. Which they try to do. Miserably. As even a 3 year old could predict, the (super skinny, 17 year old) leader of team 6 is not himself anymore after the terrible, totally avoidable female suicide bomber atrocity. He starts losing his edge and the other members see it. Typical ""do you have a problem with me!?"" allegation occurs, followed by even more cliche ""yeah, I think you're weak. I think I make a better team leader than you. I think so, and [dead suicide vest seal guy] would have thought so too!""

Lame little hissy fit half mma/ jiu-jitsu fight occurs which is then broken up by the GENERAL! Uh oh! we're in trouble now. And the rest of the movie including killing Bin Laden is a blur because all I could think while watching this is Zero Dark Thirty did it SO MUCH BETTER.

Okay. I'll confess. The only reason I bought this was because I saw a scene on youtube where the only cool actor in this movie (mr. I should be the seal team captain) sees a super cute girl on base and basically charms the hell out of her with him being a badass navy seal and I wanted to see that scene in the movie. Imagine my shock when its not even in there! They cut it out! I paid $6 for nothing! Actually that's not true, I do listen to the soundtrack all the time because its really good. Its like a cross between inception and.... something.. good. But yeah please don't buy this movie. The hot girl scene is not even in there. I warned you.",1394841600,10,3201,4.35678391959799

1)  Inaccuracy:  I've read and researched a lot about this event.  Unfortunately too much of the movie just doesn't stack up.  There are sources of information, even days after the event, that contradict what is shown on screen.  For instance that the president played golf that day while they were executing the operation.  Or that the helicopters used were secret stealth helicopters.  They also don't go into any of the things we found out after such as the controversy of never showing Osama's body.  Or that America left the doctor in Pakistan out to dry, for which he was subsequently jailed and tortured.  Or that the seal team all died in a mysterious helicopter crash a year later.

2)  The Politics:  It starts off with clips that prop up Obama and edit clips out of context to make fun of Romney and other Republicans.  I found that off putting from the start.  Look, getting Osama was a good thing for America.  Many people contributed that are both Democrat and Republican, both in Obama's Administration and during the previous one.  This story is one for all Americans.  So to re-write history to prop up Obama was bad enough, but to then to take it further political with denigrating views of Republicans sort of infused a certain feeling of propaganda.  It certainly wasn't as blatant as the typical Michael Bay film, but it was unwelcome for something that is more of a documentary look at the event that America takes seriously.

3)  The Experience:  The acting was well done, certainly better than that of a movie I love, Act of Valor.  So I give credit to the actors and the director.  However, the execution of the story just didn't do it for me.  I can't take too much away from the movie since it is supposed to be the retelling of an actual event.  Events don't package up all nice and neat like a 2 hour movie does.  And I don't want them to stretch or malign the truth any more than they already did.  But in the end, it just felt like it was so-so.

I would recommend Act of Valor or even Black Hawk Down over this movie.  I haven't seen Zero Dark Thirty yet but anticipate it.  I would only recommend this movie to fans of those three movies but not to the average movie goer.  I think there are plenty of other movies that are more entertaining and plenty of other military style movies that are more accurate.",1379808000,4,2371,4.5058823529411764

5381082,1,B00A34LX2M,"Although this film exists in a Blu-ray version, most of it is presented through extremely poor imagery. Your grandfather's 8-mm movies, shot from a car traveling over a potholed road in a dust storm during an earthquake, were far easier to follow and endure. The driving, incessant soundtrack (it really isn't music) overwhelms the production: it is relentless. If you turn on the English captions and turn down the sound all the way, you can see why: this is a film without much plot to engage anyone. One gets the impression that the whole thing could have been produced more compellingly in a 20-minute documentary (or pseudo-documentary) than in a full-length feature. I ejected the disc a half hour into it. Whatever might follow could not possibly engage me, I was sure. I did manage to see a few seconds of footage taken in a federal building that was well filmed, clear, and steadily framed, to real Blu-ray standards. As such, it was jarring in the context of the chaos that mostly preceded it.

5381085,2,B00A34LX2M,"The raid that took place to kill terrorist Osama Bin Laden was standard procedure and put together not over hours but over years. As in the film ZERO DARK THIRTY the difficulty in simply finding him took a great amount of time. Once found, in a country that would have objected to our simply going in to take him out, the difficulty of capturing or killing Bin Laden was even more difficult. So why make a movie that appears to be a semi-action film when the real story took place behind the scenes?

The plot line of the movie is simple and well known to most. Osama Bin Laden was the terrorist responsible for the attack on U.S. soil that happened on 9/11 where the Twin Towers in New York City were brought down by two jet airliners. The entire military and espionage organizations of this country then focused on capturing/killing Bin Laden who went on the lam for years before they could find him. Once found a plan was formed and Seal Team Six was sent in to capture/kill him. They did kill him and then dumped his body in the ocean. That summarizes the events and most of this film. But the film is 90 minutes long so we have to round it out with more.

That rounding out goes from good to bad. As with ZERO DARK the movie tells the behind the scenes actions going on that led to the event. Some of these come off as believable and others come off as far from it. The other meat around the bones of this film is the fictional depictions of the men of Seal Team Six and the melodramatic problems that they have with the plans and with each other. With as compelling a story as they have to work with here, why insert this clap trap garbage to round out the film to 90 minutes?

On the good side the acting here is well done with a number of good performances, enough not to single any one out. The production values seen on screen are also well done.

On the bad side is the fact that this film feels rushed, as if it had to be put together and slapped on the screen as fast as possible. Thinking back to what was happening at the time that it actually the case. Some may choose to ignore the politics involved with this movie's release but it first aired on cable TV just before the elections of 2012. This could be considered a coincidence but the fact that the film was financed by the Weinstein brothers who supported President Obama, that the film portrays him in the best light possible and that there is the inclusion of a snip of Presidential contender Mitt Romney saying the war was over, even though he wasn't a part of any of the events happening here, makes it hard to believe there weren't political motivations to this movie not just being made but rushed to be seen.

This is sad because in the haste of releasing this film all thoughts of making the best film possible seem to have been tossed aside. A number of people who are involved in the military or who have served found the depiction of the Seal Team deplorable. The schizophrenic feel derived from a movie that goes from melodramatic moments between soldiers to a depiction of how events transpired makes for a confusing and unenjoyable film.

ZERO DARK THIRTY may not have been the most exciting movie about a military event ever filmed but it did offer a straight forward story that wasn't focused on doing little more than portraying the military as angst ridden co-workers or the President as the hero who came to save the world. It told the story of the men and women who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make the capture/death of Bin Laden a reality. This film doesn't compare.",1372118400,2,3570,4.3933434190620275

Obviously another team member would not use that term to reference a fellow SAILOR, or OPERATOR. Also, SEALs are not part of a ""squadron"", which, as the other writer pointed out, is a British, primarily an SAS, term. SEALs are members of boat teams. Also, as picky as it may seem, when the LT Cmdr, or ""Skipper"" of the team, was wearing his Navy blues, he wore his jump wings below his ""BUDweiser"", or Trident. SEALS wear their Navy/Marine gold jump wings below their ribbons.

Right after the Oscars I began reading reviews for this film, Seal Team Six and was pleased with the reviews worth reading. Deciding this would provide me with my selection of film portrayal, I bought it. This time I make the right choice to purchase. The casting, editing, format were perfect. A fast paced, engaging film that captures one from the first scene until the final credits.

Unlike Zero Dark Thirty, the captured terrorist has a bag put over his head and then easily gives up critical information. Obama's movie can't have anything to make it look like Obama is responsible for water-boarding or aggressive interrogation. This movie while making the most of the Bin Laden killing to show Obama as a fearless leader, it can't actually have any torture or water boarding, because Obama was against it. Obama was also promised to close Gitmo. But, He is glad to take credit and get the benefits of the Bush administration policies dealing with terrorist.

Having rewatched both Zero Dark Thirty and Seal Team Six, I wanted to add some further comments.  First, those that see ""Seal"" as a campaign project for Obama's reelection have a point.  He occupies a prominent position in this movie.  Personally, I think he made the right call. but I also think that almost anyone in his position would have made the same call.  Secondly, and most importantly, ""Seal"" gets many of the important particulars wrong, if Zero Dark Thirty is the benchmark, which I think is fair, as few have challenged the basic honesty of that portrayal(except, of course,for those that question the effectiveness of the enhanced interrogations or torture.)  Whether it's the identification and location of the courier or the actual raid, ""Seal"" apparently gets almost nothing right. Clearly those involved with ""Seal"" simply didn't do the comprehensive research that those responsible for ""Zero"" did. I still recommend ""Seal"", but simply be aware that it is inaccurate in many regards.",1361836800,5,1125,5.081521739130435

5381143,3,B00A34LX2M,"I saw this before Zero Dark Thirty - not too bad.

Of course Zero Dark Thirty had more time / money for their production - they spent more time on character development than this movie did, or at least focused on different characters. Zero Dark Thirty spent more time on the female CIA analyst (it was interesting), Seal Team Six spent more time on the Seal Team Six members. Both cases of character development are probably largely fictional, as one wonders how much accurate info anyone's going to be able to get regarding either?

One thing I did like about this movie was as they were going through the compound, as they shot someone, the film froze and they printed the name of the terrorist shot and their relation to Bin Laden or their position in the organization.

If I give this one a 3-star rating, I'd probably give Zero Dark Thirty a 3 1/2 star rating?
Yeah, Zero Dark Thirty is probably better, but it's not as good as some would have you believe (It would have to be a slow movie year before I gave it film of the year).

I first watched this movie in a Singapore cinema and had the suspicion it was CENSORED by the Singapore pro-Islamic authorities which usually censors everything of a political or religious nature.

I like this movie because it gives a personalized human face to those brave Navy Seals who not only had to struggle with their jobs, but also with their own personal lives when they're not on duty. It also shows the tenacity of the female CIA analyst (in reality: there was more than 1 female involved) who battled discrimination with her male colleagues in order to make the Mission a success.

What I don't like about this movie is that the last few scenes were too hastily edited. I'm sure the soldiers did a lot more strenuous training and practice, and that the raid didn't last less than 5 minutes.

I also don't like the FACT that the CIA and the Americans didn't perform satisfactory, if any at all, rescue operations to save their key human assets who helped them secure their Mission objectives. Those non-Americans were jailed, lives were lost and America doesn't seem to even care! Then again, this notorious American ""use and abuse"" trait seems to be in sync with their past historical treatment of their ALLIES in Indo-china during the Vietnam war. After the war, the Viet Commies massacred local American ALLIES with impunity and America didn't help them at all! All the Americans did was to spend time rescuing hookers to bring home.

IF anyone can learn anything from this historical reminder: NEVER work for the CIA, or any agency, etc. unless you secure a good deal, and please don't rely on empty verbal promises of the CIA. When push comes to shove, Americans mostly care about themselves, then again, the same is true for all government agencies everywhere, they only care about themselves.

The movie shows the main entry to the compound opens right into the main courtyard...wrong.  The real UBL compound the main entry doors opened into a long corridor like alley that then finally opened into the courtyard, a kind of foyer to the compound.

Oh, yes, they prattle on about torture and whatnot...hey, we'll never really know. Classified still exists even though Hollywood prattles about access...yeah, right. Access.

Particular kudos go to Freddy Rodriguez and Anson Mount who has a H U G E career ahead of him. See him play ""Cherry"" in this flick and then watch the bonus and find that accent doesn't exist. He's an A+ actor and I hope he is therefore recognized as such.

Seal Team six is a movie I like so much I will never lend it out. I suggest you buy it, and study it.

Before I go into any real analysis let me just say that I am NOT a republican.  I, personally, find both parties to be corrupt, out of touch, apathetic to anything/anyone but the security of their own jobs, and other negative phases, metaphors, and adjectives involving several species of leeches.  I hate politicians, period, regardless of political affiliation.

Now that THAT is out my system, let us begin.

While I love just about any production shown on National Geographic (NATGEO) given their high production value and (usually) strong sense of objectivity, SEAL Team Six came off as a political commercial or pat on the back for President Barrack Obama.  The film dedicates its first ten minutes to barely mention information obtained from a detainee at Guantanamo Bay in 2002 and montages its way to 2010 with LOTS of clips showing President Obama defending his position on hunting for Osama Bin Laden while, curiously, only republican politicians slammed his position.

This, the film could have done without and supplemented it with Presidents Bush and Obama talking about an ongoing hunt for Bin Laden or, God forbid, NOT bring in politics at all.  This would have made the first part of the film easier to be taken seriously as it blatantly came across as a political ad... especially given it's on-air release date of November 4th.  However, it didn't end there as the film kept reverting back to the political side showing Obama and Clinton watching a live-feed of the raid when no such thing happened (or so it was reported).  While many would see this as awesome given their political affiliation, it alienates others and, therefor, is not as appealing to the general audience.

On to the film itself.  I could tell that the production crew were deeply in love with GoPro cameras as they were featured heavily and much of the on-screen footage came from GoPros.  BTW: when you're showing any camcorder footage as on-screen with the dates in the corner, be sure to keep it within continuity as one scene had 1-31-2011 dated in the corner and immediately cuts to a scene in Hampton Virginia with the dates October 28, 2010 front and center.  Either way, the constant helmet cams and GoPros, while fascinating, were used too much and were used to make the action seem faster when it wasn't.

My next criticism involves the format of the film itself.  It self-labels itself as a docudrama, a highly dramatized documentary of sorts even though it's not.  SEAL Team Six presents this with a flashback format as the operators and players are detailing their experiences and feelings after the fact.  Never was really fond of that style as it takes away surprise as well as any riveting sense of excitement: it just goes on and on.  Indeed, SEAL Team Six is, for a lack of a better SAT term that critics love to use, boring.  While there was a little 'excitement' as an old school SEAL butts heads with a younger one he has to take orders from, there was little else.

I tried to wait until the end raid and noticed several things that directly contradicted ""Mark Owen's"" account in ""No Easy Day.""  The raid on Bin Laden's compound was portrayed as considerably more... loud than the silent raid depicted in the book.  Granted the scene was still lackluster and failed to keep me on the edge but maybe the trick is keeping the audience on the edge by suspense, not action.  The filmmakers could have have accomplished as much by keeping it suspenseful thus making the film more enjoyable and keeping true with the historical accuracy.

Next is the acting and in a word; bland.  While William Fitchner is a grossly under appreciated actor, the rest of the cast did not contribute anything decent.  They just read lines and the story went on.  Oh yeah, they had a rapper from MTV... applause?  Didn't think so.

SEAL Team Six could have been a really good film as the production value was high but the story is a good one but for a myriad of reasons it just fell short.  It wasn't exciting, well acted, and tried too hard to push Obama in the spotlight, which is a total turnoff regardless of who the president is.

You could tell it was rushed to get out before the other Bin Ladin movie.  Secondly, it used the fake documentary format which made it seem even more fake.  Lastly, Harvey Weinstein, a huge Obama donor, couldn't resist making it into a propaganda love fest for the Obama campaign.  Not sure how many people were affected by it, but it was still unseemly.  Oh yeah, plus the casting was pretty weak--for example one of the SEALs was played by a rapper famous for the MTV show ""Pimp My Ride.""

5381176,1,B00A34LX2M,"Total Obama propaganda especially since it orginally aired 3 days before the election. And with a cast like it has there's no way to take it seriously. I thought this was suppose to be a documentary nothing but facts from legit sources type movie but it only confirmed who much pro obama propaganda hollywood has & took great artistic license in making this film which helped show that the true point of the show was for & why it was rushed to completion & air in time to try to affect the election. You might as well put a guy in a clown suit & have him try to report real time serious breaking news. Could you take seriously a clown reporting Hurricane Katrina or the Tsaumai that hit Japan or India? Doubt it. Had the mission not gone well I doubt you'd see anyone rushing to put out a tv movie about it just like when desert one failed or showing anything that made the president look bad. Regardless of one's politics, every party/ admisistration has it's faults & failures this show is full of it & wraps it with a bow of peace, love, & nieve wishful thinking. Clearly when it comes to Iraq or Afganistan & especially osama bin laudin it's hard to not show politics one way or the other but this movie is total BS propaganda dripping with bias particularly with anti military anti security neivity. Watching this ""movie"" you would think the world didn't need the likes of regular army let alone special operations units like Seal team 6 except once in a while after a successful mission & that after rejoycing in the successful mission that the unit & anything like it should be able to be locked away behind glass that reads ""break only in emerency, till then party like nothing bad ever happens"". You can't take any of the cast seriously in their roles which lessens the events and truly give the impression of a hollywood attempt at history telling. It's like having Kat Williams or Eddie Murphy or Dave Chappel report serious news you just cant do it there's no creditiblity to it. Regardless of your own politics you'll agree it's just bad & takes away from the point of the team, the mission & the years & resources spent trying to get the most wanted man in the world & the joy when the missions finally successful. I read in a book by one of the first leaders of the seal teams about how ""truth be told no one works hard to put themselves out of a job then seals.""

Some of the details, no one except the SEAL team knows. Much is left to interpretation and speculation. My only peeve is that during the raid too much english is spoken and they didn't use silencers which are very common in the SPECOPS world. The critique about the trouble between the SEALS is overblown. These guys are run thru a very narrow sieve to find guys who can do this job. They are tough, smart dedicated and crazy. They train until they don't think about it. They make great sacrifices and have great egos that they must control. There is a pecking order and rank means little expirence is everything. They have the supreme discipline to be undisciplined! Still this is a very entertaining movie and should be viewed as well as any/all movies/books related to this operation.

5381187,5,B00A34LX2M,"This movie, a masterful but understated portrayal of UBL's hunt-down and killing is about the most honest rendition of what it is like to work in the USG that I have ever seen -- period. The lead character is a CIA grunt who is bright, but not brilliant; a bureaucratic loner, dedicated to and living only through her work. She is one who keeps her head down and her antenna up.

Working in a small group of Specialists without much supervision, it is the group's job to catch and kill UBL. No one else in the whole USG has this single mission assigned to them. That's it, literally: No road maps, no hardwired theories, just a small budget and blood and guts with your butt always on the line for instant results.  It is a heady cultural environment that can either drive you nuts or drive you to finding the right answers, which is what happened in this as in so many other less heralded cases. This movie reminded me of my group fighting the issue of small arms and light weapons at the United Nations.

As this movie shows, working in the USG is a ""contact sport"" in which ""loaded dice"" are rolled daily. Any unit that comes up ""craps"" one time too often can and will be either shipped off to Siberia, or looking for a job the next day. It is always brutal, high-level work with low pay and even lower rewards, but when you are in the trenches, patriotic exhilaration takes over and you find yourself running on the fumes of history.

Here in the aftermath of 911, the USG was never more highly motivated. It worked like a single mad organism. Ad Hoc groups popped up across the landscape, and a network of concerned bureaucrats from top to bottom found ways to work together. It was a no BS environment. Hunting down a single fugitive was and probably will always remain an iterative trial and error process: The best ideas, do indeed somehow finally filter their way up to the top. That is the nature of the process.

Maya was stubborn, a common characteristic of people caught in the trenches between the proverbial ""rock and a hard place."" It was not just her intuition that told her that UBL's driver was the Holy Grail to locating him. It was also the logic in every piece of data she had ever collected for her entire brief career. Only the truth comes packaged in such a configuration that there is the kind of certainty she had.  Once she ""latched on"" to this thread, no one was going to ""talk her off of it.""

Like a dog holding on to a bone, she did not let loose until she hit pay dirt.  After being ignored and mistreated for almost six years -- and was again being insulted in the very meeting where her efforts bore fruit. The chairman of the meeting was asked what she was doing in a high level meeting where UBL's house was displayed on a large screen? Maya finally got her revenge of sorts by answering that she was the MF who located that house on the screen? This, ""come back,"" will live in cinematographic history.

I did not join the Katherine Bigelow bandwagon on the film where she landed an Academy Award, but I am fully on board this time, even though ZDT is not even one of the nominees for Best Film (go figure?)

The torture in the movie, such as it was, not only was effective, but was also strategically sensible. It was not a case of a bunch of ""cowboys"" (like Abu Ghraib) out to have some fun, but dedicated CIA operatives who knew what they were looking for and were prepared to do what was needed (and nothing more) to find it. They did not succeed, but from where I sit, it was sure worth the try. If torture has to be justified, this portrayal of how it was done gets my vote, and I am profoundly against the use of torture. However, when it is announced to a prisoner : ""that If you lie, I will hurt you,"" the prisoner has been warned. They know the deal: All's fair in war. Ten Stars.",1357862400,8,3827,4.33986013986014

5381189,3,B00A34LX2M,"""SEAL Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden"" was first shown on the National Geographic Channel in early November, 2012 in an attempt to beat Kathryn Bigelow's ""Zero Dark Thirty"" -- which tells the same story -- to the screen.  A break in the manhunt for Osama bin Laden serves as the backdrop for the story about a group of U.S. Navy SEALs who undertake to find the terrorist leader.

Eight months of surveillance of the suspected bin Laden hideout reveals high walls, tinted windows, and barbed wire surrounding a two-story home and guest house.  Despite inconclusive evidence that bin Laden is inside the compound, and ignoring the possible ramifications of an unannounced attack on Pakistani soil, the Pentagon orders the attack.  SEAL Team Six bands together in the most daring military operation in a generation, completing their mission in a dramatic final showdown.

Interpolated into the film is actual news footage of President Obama announcing the raid to the world, which gives the movie a documentary feel.  The movie parallels the plot of TV's ""Homeland.""  Both CIA analysts Carrie (Claire Danes, ""Homeland"") and Vivian Hollins (Kathleen Robertson, ""SEAL Team Six..."") have been determined to get their man since the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers -- Carrie the fictional Abu Nazir, Vivian, bin Laden.

The characters in ""SEAL Team Six"" have little depth and resemble  types prevalent in numerous wartime movies.  They tend to blandness.  What works, however, is the depiction of the long, often tedious hours, days, and months spent by teams of professionals in various areas.  The raid is the culmination of the work of hundreds of these individuals.

The single bonus extra on the Blu-ray edition is the featurette, ""The Making of `SEAL Team Six:' The Raid on Osama bin Laden.""",1356912000,6,1794,5.02027027027027

5381191,3,B00A34LX2M,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi

White House officials will not ""confirm or deny"" if Seal Team Six got it right or not.
There are a couple things we know they got wrong. None of the compound's children wandered outside as the Black Hawk's arrived on the scene like they did in the movie. Also Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head when he ducked his head out the doorway to see what was going on.
I haven't seen Zero Dark Thirty, a film also about this successful Seal mission. But I suspect it's the better of the two knowing the actors involved and what some critics, I respect, have said.
But Seal Team Six is worth a watch while waiting for the other to arrive on DVD.
There's little doubt that this mission was what every Navy Seal has been trained for and more than willing to participate in.
The film mixes actors with real characters via news footage in a documentary style thriller. The CIAthink they have located Bin Laden but clearly most operations can't be carried out on a hunch. The President does have to also weigh an unannounced attack on Pakistani soil.
I liked the peak inside of how Navy Seals lived and trained. At one point there is conflict between two of the Seals, basically because an older member of the unit, has been passed over, and made to answer to a younger unit commander. But regardless, of petty circumstance the men know they must show no show no sign of division as they carry out an impressive attack, which lasts less than 38 minutes.",1356566400,34,1507,4.5
