741808,5,6303962068,"I love this movie so much. ""Harriet Craig"" has to be one of Joan's very best dramatic roles and one of, if not the very best film she ever made during the 50's.

...Why is this movie so perfect?

Now more than ever before, Joan played such a personal role. I am not going to say that Harriet Craig was just like Joan. But I think this was her most private movie role, either before or since; because Harriet was so fundamental.

As you already know, Miss Crawford plays the title-role, Harriet Craig. Harriet is a domestic artist (in 1950 when this movie came out, the term was known as ""housewife."") Harriet lives with her husband, Walter (played by Wendell Corey) and her adult (yet, somewhat younger) cousin, Clare Raymond (portrayed by K.T. Stevens.)

The Craig's are an upper-middle class family. They live in a beautiful colonial home that Walter grew up in. And, Harriet takes much pride in managing her home. In fact, she has made it her life-long reason for living to make sure everything in her home is absolutely up to the high standards that she has always had. For example, Harriet doesn't like the blinds opened past 11:00 a.m. because as she put it, ""I am not going to have the sun fade my furniture."" Of course, she has a grand wrapping staircase that empties into an elaborate foyer. But it goes without saying that Harriet's two domestics (Mrs. Harold played by Viola Roache and Lottie played by ""Grandma Walton"" aka, Ellen Corby) are relegated to using the back entrance to go up and down the house floors. It was somewhat interesting to see Harriet scold Lottie for using the front stairs. Joan looked even more frazzled and caught off guard than her counterpart; perhaps, because she knew the importance of keeping a good home?

The movie has a lot of subtext and maybe even secondary subplots. For example, Harriet was made out to be this huge mean-spirited villain. By the end of the movie the film's director wanted the viewer to dislike Harriet because (by now) Harriet had managed to chase everyone in her life away from her. But what did she do that was so wrong? She wanted to make sure that her home always looked perfect and she liked to keep her hubby on a (somewhat) close leash. One might argue that any good wife would do the things that Harriet did?

I really picked up that the others in her life (besides her sweet cousin, Clare) all had an attitude problem. Harriet's husband, Wendell was a huge wimp. He let all the women in his life tell him what to do. He lived in his parents' home his entire life, then when his mother passed on he married a woman that would baby him. And, if that's not bad enough, he also had a full-time maid, Mrs. Harold that loved to kiss and pamper his bee-hind. Why? Speaking of Mrs. Harold, she had such a personality problem. She was simply an hourly maid; so why did she think she was in the same league as Mrs. Craig? The woman was so stuck-up and persnickety towards Mrs. Craig. Maybe she was envious of Mrs. Craig? Maybe not. One thing I am certain of is that she resented Mrs. Craig. Mrs. Harold resented her because she thought she should run the home, not Mrs. Craig.

And if this isn't bad enough, Harriet had to put up with her neighbor who made Mrs. Kravitz look like a walk in the park. Mrs. Frazier (Fiona O'Shiel) was a huge busy-body that was looking to weave her widow's web right around Harriet's husband. She even used her young son, Danny (Pat Mitchell,) to lure Walter to her home. I can't think of anything lower than to use a small child in such a disgraceful and wanton way. But Walter (always) fell for it! Hook, line and sinker.

Here's a little bit of trivia: Kathryn Card played  Mrs. Norwood (a bit/uncredited role) in this film. Of course Kathryn Card is world-famous for portraying Mrs. McGillicudy; the mother of everyone's favorite redhead!

The last scenes between Walter and Harriet are probably Joan's most pivotal acting ever. Again, I must reiterate, this was her most exclusive role ever. And over the years since this movie has been out (57 to be exact) it has been written that Joan was just playing an extension to herself. I do not know if that is true or not. What I do think is true is that Harriet just wanted some happiness. She wanted someone to give her a chance. She was always afraid to let her true self show because she couldn't trust anyone; least of all, a man. And when Walter finally got a good look at the real Harriet do you know what he did? He walked out on her.

Many years later, when asked about this movie, Miss Crawford only said this, ""'Harriet Craig' was all right. Formula but not too bad. At least I played a woman with which a portion of the audience could identify. Or is it, 'with whom?'"" Maybe there's a little bit of Harriet Craig inside all of us. Someone that just wants to be understood and loved, unconditionally.",1194566400,14,4859,4.485294117647059
741809,5,6303962068,"In the1935 film Craig's Wife, we get Rosalind Russell, the woman for whom the word ""madcap"" seemed coined, whose giddy portrayals of fast-talking, double-dealing dames with machine-gun delivery - acting! Well, it turns out that Miss Russell could act, but she often didn't get the chance once she'd been typecast as a motor-mouthed madonna. However, in playwright George Kelly's Pulitzer Prize-winning story of an overbearing, scheming matron who is a little too involved with her possessions, she acts her marvelous, little heart out. Mr. Kelly, uncle of Princess Grace, has written one of the all-time great female roles, one that any actress would give her eyeteeth to play.

So, in 1950, full-time Star Joan Crawford, along with director/lover Vincent Sherman, streamlined ""Craig's Wife"" (removing every scene that didn't include Ms Crawford), retitled it ""Harriet Craig"", and turned it into a tour-de-force for the Diva. The epitome of every neurotic, deeply disturbed female that Joan ever portrayed, Harriet Craig is a housewife - married to her house, a monster of control who cares more about her home and her possessions than she cares about her marriage. Because of her domestic obsession, she alienates friends and family.

Crawford, then in her middle forties, was in yet another phase of her remarkably resilient career, which had taken her from flapper to proletarian working girl to fur-swathed glamour queen to steely, against-all-odds survivor. Her subsequent roles were even fiercer. Sherman was the first, (but not the last), to see the similarities between Harriet Craig and Joan Crawford. As he recalled in his 1996 autobiography, ""I realized that in many ways, she was the embodiment of Harriet Craig...in her obsessive attitude toward her home; her distrust of men and her desire to control; her power of manipulation; and her concept of the proper way for a man to behave toward his wife."" Years later, when Crawford's daughter Christina published her tell-all memoir, Mommie Dearest, it was not difficult to see those same parallels in her daughter's description of Crawford's compulsive housekeeping.

Harriet Craig is a must for any true collector of Ms. Crawford's film work.",1187481600,5,2204,5.291428571428572

741811,4,6303962068,"Joan, with director Sherman, trimming *all* the fat away from *Craig's Wife* (that means removing every scene in which Joan would *not* be present), and turning it into a tour-de-force for La Crawford. As the epitome of every neurotic, deeply disturbed female that Joan ever portrayed, *Harriet Craig* is Joan with a capital J. Taking the role in her mouth and shaking it into submission, she is playing, ultimately, another facet of Joan herself. But what Joan film role *didn't* become Joan herself - either before or *after* filming? In a case of Joan's art imitating her life, as well as her life imitating her art, Harriet provides Joan with yet *one* more of those peculiar roles - roles which must have been written with *only* Joan in mind, since it would be difficult to imagine *any* other actress in this role. If Rosalind Russell had had this much focus on her in *her* version, *Craig's Wife*, it's hard to imagine if she could have sustained it, since part of Russell's strength was her ability to respond to other characters while seemingly on a course all her own. But Joan, never one to shy away from *any* movie role, makes *Harriet Craig* one the great milestones of her career. And we are indebted to her for it. As she explains to her niece (she *always* has nieces in movies like this - sweet young things who come to live with her and become her indentured servants) about how to ""keep men in line,"" we are given more pure-Joan philosophy. With lines like, ""...the average woman *does* put her life in someone else's hands - her husbands'. That's why she usually comes to grief,"" and ""No man is *born* ready for marriage - he has to be trained,"" it is familiar Joan territory. Familiar now, because we've seen Joan spackling her angst all over movie and TV screens for decades, but along with *Mildred Pierce*, *Queen Bee* and *Torchsong*, *Harriet Craig*, at the time, was a new dimension in Joan's personal psychosis committed to film.",1106352000,6,1960,4.700581395348837
741812,4,6303962068,"Joan Crawford, by all indications from so many who knew her, was a control freak.  She had a fetish for cleanliness; she had to dominate everyone around her or she would destroy them.  Everything had to be perfect.  Nothing out of place.

So when one watches Harriet Craig one realizes he is watching the Real Joan Crawford......someone who is NOT acting but playing her True Self.

The movie is fun to watch just to see Crawford get off on being manipulative and controlling.  One just loves to hate her.  The performances by the supporting cast are outstanding.  As I said before, Crawford is just playing herself.  This is the way she really was.....and phony to the bone.  This is also why it is so much fun to watch her in movies like this.

741814,5,6303962068,"This is an engrossing film of a cold, calculating, and manipulative woman, Harriet Craig, who is married to Walter Craig, a very nice man who adores her. She lives in an impeccably appointed mansion with him, has two servants, and a poor relation, Claire, who caters to her every whim. Life should be great. Wrong!
Harriet is not happy, unless she is able to control everyone and everything around her. A regular martinet and perfectionist, she is cruel to the servants and totally self absorbed. If something does not revolve around Harriet, then it is of no import. She stops at nothing to get what she wants, even if it means destroying those who love her.
Harriet keeps her husband on a short lease, and he is so besotted by her that, at first, he does not even notice. She is a master at maintaining her own status quo. Then, one day she goes too far. Walter is going get a long awaited promotion that will require him to travel abroad. As this does not fit in with Harriet's plans, she surreptitiously moves heaven and earth to quash the promotion. At first, Walter is puzzled by his change of circumstances, but when he discovers Harriet's treachery, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Joan Crawford is magnificent as the cold, implacable, and  shrewish Harriet. Wendell Corey is wonderful as the besotted husband, who has his kind heart ripped out by his wife's perfidy. Look for a wonderful performance by the delightful Lucille Watson, as the perceptive wife of Walter's boss. While Harriet may have fooled everyone else, she certainly did not fool her.
This is a wonderful film that all Joan Crawford fans will love. Aficionados of classic films will, likewise, enjoy it. Bravo!",1007251200,44,1676,4.739726027397261

A neurotic perfectionist and a stickler for absolute cleanliness (shades of Mommie Dearest!)  Ms. Craig makes it impossible for her husband  Walter (Wendell Corey) to feel at ease in his own home.  Eventually, Walter begins to get intimations of his wife's true character and when he finally sees the light, he smashes her favourite vase and walks out!  Bravo!  Joan Crawford does a prime job of putting over the selfish title - character, equipping it with enough sock to cloak the obviousness that motivates the dramatics. The original (and rather better) screen version of this story was made in 1936 as CRAIG'S WIFE with Rosalind Russell in the title role; it was  faithfully directed by Dorothy Arzner.",997228800,4,960,4.846625766871166

Her reasons come to light when one learns of her early family history.  To a certain extent I agree with her.  In the long run a woman must depend on herself for her own protection, but Crawford's agenda leaves no room for consideration of other people's feelings.  The end leaves you feeling though that what happens is really what she wants.  I always felt this film is the one that shows what Crawford may have REALLY been like.

Living in a world of elegance,she seemingly has everything, including a devoted loving husband in Wendell Corey. Watching her hen-peck him is painful, and you wonder how he keeps on taking it (along with everyone around her). I wanted to feel sorry for Corey's character, but I couldn't. He goes around sucking on his pipe as if sucking on a lollypop. Just when you think he's going to grow some hair on his chest, he continues to whimper and apologize.  Ultimately there is a breaking point.  I love Joan Crawford movies of the 50's because the parts she played were so over-the-top, and even campy.  Harriet Craig is all that and more.

Six of one, a half dozen of the other, take your pick.  There's a cousin floating around the house as her assistant.  Harriet Craig needs an assistant because, obviously, the maid and the cook are too busy doing other things.  No one can move in Harriet Craig's house without her say-so.  Even the little boy next door gets the heave-ho.  And if you're going to invite your boss for dinner, don't sit and play cards with his wife at THAT table and move THAT lamp because now you've screwed up everything.  And really, if you're going to be a shaking idiot of a maid you WILL be fired.  ESPECIALLY IF YOU BREAK ONE OF MY COFFEE CUPS.

742185,5,6303962068,"Before reading the following review please keep in mind that this is a Region 2 DVD and will not play in any Region 1 DVD or Blue Ray player. Your DVD or Blue Ray player has to be equipped to play any region DVD. These players are known as Region Free machines. Unfortunately, ""Harriet Craig"" has never seen a Region 1 North American release, but has been released in foreign countries, most notably Spain where other Joan Crawford films from her Columbia years have seen a limited DVD release. Those films include ""The Story of Esther Costello"", ""Autumn Leaves"", and ""Berserk!"".

 Having been a huge fan of Joan Crawfords for the past 20 years I have studied her films closely. In 1950 she was dating her director Vincent Sherman who had recently worked with Crawford on ""The Damned Don't Cry"". The much married Sherman was having an affair with Crawford and would direct Joan in the follow-up film ""Harriet Craig"" (as well as 1951's ""Goodbye, My Fancy"") that was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play ""Craig's Wife"" which was turned into a 1930's motion picture starring Joan's friend and co-star from ""The Women"", Rosalind Russell. In this version Joan plays a woman married to a successful engineer, played by Wendel Corey. Joan's character, Harriet, is more concerned with the running of her house and expects her servants to do what they are told or face harsh consrquences. She announces she can't have any children because her husband Walter ""doesn't like kids"". So despite the fact that Harriet's home is devoid of any little creatures she still demands to have three servants working for her, one as her maid, the other her cook, and one as her secretary/confidant who is a cousin she took in.

 The movie really is the best film in Joan's library of motion pictures that has her portraying a character that really resembles what she (Crawford) was like in real life. From the reading I have done on Joan her portrayal of Harriet Craig wasn't that much of a stretch for her. In reality Crawford was a control freak, wanted her home cleaned impeccably, and was obsessed with neatness. At the beginning of the movie Harriet tells her maid that she wants the window blinds closed before 11:30 am as she doesn't want the sunlight fading things. She then instructs her to take care of her most prized possession, a vase that stands above the fireplace. Before leaving the house Harriet gives the maid a long list of instructions that she expects her to remember. If you have read Joan's daughter's memoir ""Mommie Dearest"" you can't help but see the similarities between Crawford and the role she played in this film. In one part of the book Christina talks about Joan's film ""Queen Bee"" and how she had to leave the theatre upon viewing it as she stated, ""That wasn't any acting job on mother's part. That was exactly the way I knew her at home"". I have a feeling Christina was talking about ""Harriet Craig"" as she got the films confused in her mind.

 There are also some amazing supporting players in ""Harriet Craig"": among them are the wonderful Ellen Corby who played Harriet's maid Lotty. ""Lotty is completely hopeless""; ""Now look at what you've done!""; ""Mrs. Harrold will send you your wages minus the cost of the cup!""; are some of the lines Harriet barks at the innocent and vulnerable Lotty before she fires her. Ellen would become quick friends with Joan in real life and go on to win three Emmys for her role as Grandma Walton in ""The Waltons"". Another great performance is by KT Stevens who plays Harriet's cousin/secretary Claire. Stevens is most famous for her television soap opera work on ""General Hospital"" and ""Days of Our Lives"" in the 1960's, and for playing psychotic Vanessa Prentiss on ""The Young and The Restless"" from 1976-1981.

 I really believe director Sherman conferred with the script writers on ""Harriet Craig"" to put as many Joan Crawford attributes into the role as possible. Like Harriet Joan's father deserted her and her mother when she was only a child, and most alarmingly like Harriet Joan worked in a laundry to put food on the table before she became an actress.

 An excellent film, if you want to see the real Joan Crawford forget about ""Mommie Dearest"" although that film does have a ring of truth to it. Watch ""Harriet Craig and see Joan Crawford play Joan Crawford.

 ""Harriet Craig"" finally gets a DVD release in November, 2012 when it will be available in a beautiful box set by Sony/TCM called ""Joan Crawford in the 1950's"". The film will available with three other Joan movies, two which have never been put on DVD: ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Story of Esther Costello""!!! ""Queen Bee"" will also be part of the package.",1297209600,4,4670,4.737684729064039
742186,5,6303962068,"For fans of Joan Crawford who discovered her through the 1981 camp classic ""Mommie Dearest"" hoping to see movies that depicted Crawford as a meticulous neat freak, look no further than ""Harriet Craig"". The film is about a woman married to a rich man whose life revolves around her home, a house that she is dedicated in maintaining order and cleanliness. No doubt Crawford chose the role because she could relate to the theme in the film as many who knew Joan in her personal life discovered Joan was obsessed with keeping a clean house almost to the point of insanity. Obviously, both Harriet Craig and Joan Crawford suffered from bipolar disorder as well as having early signs of dementia.

 ""Harriet Craig"" was the second film Vincent Sherman directed Crawford in, the first being ""The Damned Don't Cry"". He would eventually direct Joan in 1951's ""Goodbye, My Fancy"", one of her last films for Warner Brothers. When Joan did ""Harriet Craig"" she had enough power as a leading actress in Hollywood to be ""loaned out"" to Columbia which shows how popular she was in the eyes of the public. Speaking of Vincent Sherman Joan was having an affair with the much married man during production on all three Sherman/Crawford collaborations, something Crawford was known for as she would often ""date"" her directors to give her a certain power.

 ""Harriet Craig"", like many of Joan's Columbia films, has never been released on DVD or Blue Ray here in North America despite being released on DVD in Spain.",1293494400,5,1494,4.82421875

I've looked for a DVD (apart from the Spanish version) for years. Why on earth has no one reissued a remastered print of it in this format? Joan Crawford gives her best style of melodramatic performance, full of looks, innuendoes and totally conniving, manipulative, lying bitchiness. She is surrounded by sterling performers. This represents the movies as they used to be and is totally riveting. PLEASE let us have a DVD.",1244246400,4,563,5.0

It really shows how controlling individuals really end up very, very lonely and alone in the end.

742192,2,6303962068,"Harriet Craig has a serious personality disorder. She is a skilled manipulator, and justifies her destructive lies by blaming her father. Seems that way back when little Harriet was 14, she caught her father with another woman, and in a rage she turned her back on him completely. Extreme behavior for a 14 year-old--but she was vindictive then, too. There is no room for forgiveness or understanding in her perfectionist personality.
Anyway, Harriet is so controlling that she does great harm to the lives of all those around her, mostly by sowing discord with lies, and also with her husband using sex to keep him tied to her leash.
It all comes crashing down when her web of lies ensnares her.
In today's day and age, she would need counseling and therapy, and her wounded vicitms would need years of therapy to recover, too.
Was Joan Crawford like this character in real life? I would wager yes.
Christina was scarred for life. But Miss Crawford's mental illness was not obsessive compulsive; it's diagnosed now as a borderline personality disorder.  And that's what we see on screen. A human train wreck.
In sum, a meaningful, brave movie, and a time capsule back to a vanished era.",1206489600,9,1187,4.790243902439024
