8414579,5,B0043CCMD4,"Don't bother if you don't do subtitles but if you do you are in for a romantic treat. Artist Eloise finds a muse in the sheltered Asia where Asia finds herself in Eloise. It is beautiful, sad, and confusing. Your imagination maybe necessary to get the ending that you want to see.",1402444800,,280,4.403846153846154
8414580,5,B0043CCMD4,"Eloise's Lover (also titled Eloise) originally came out in 2009 and is a coming of age movie of college student, Asia. She seems inexperienced in relationships and love and the story begins with her entering a relationship with Nat. But after a meeting with Eloise, an artist that Asia volunteers as a figure model, she starts to develop feelings for her. Asia's friends dislike Eloise because she's a known lesbian. Once Asia's mother suspects the nature of Asia and Eloise's relationship she pushes her daughter to go out with Nat and prohibits Eloise to see Asia. The movie is not exploitational and very sensitive to the confused feelings Asia has about her love for another woman. The lead actress Diana Gomez is perfect in conveying the many emotions Asia goes through in her journey. I caught this on the Sundance channel since it doesn't seem to have a U.S. dvd release. But if you can see it I highly recommend it. Five stars.",1357430400,5,935,4.742331288343558
