I was looking for a video on Russian architecture and was excited to see this DVD with beautiful churches on a cover on Amazon. Huge disappointment! I wanted to show my students, who don't know anything about Russia except an old anti-communist propaganda, how beautiful this country is and what it really looks like. What I got from this video is a very depressing history of rising and fall of Christianity; all the people shown there look depressed and the spirit of magnificent architecture is lost behind the long and slow narration. Even the story about restoration of monasteries and icons destroyed by Soviet government sounds depressing, and it is about restoration and recovery from 70 years of suppression.  Even Suzdal, the most beautiful and happy town in Golden Ring looks and sounds depressing. And I've been there so many times and it always gave me a feeling of joy and beauty!
I don't think I will show this movie to my students. May be short cuts and without narration...",1344470400,2,1053,4.81767955801105
