Well, this summer I found that my classic Rudolph dvd had been stolen.  So I decided to pick up the blu ray after Christmas.  Not only was I surprised that the 50th anniversary edition had skimpy extras.... THE EXTRAS WEREN'T THERE.  The menu on the disc didn't even say it's the anniversary edition.  I wonder if the company just took old blurays from a bare bones release and put a new label on the disc. SO DISAPPOINTED.... I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHAT I CAN DO.",1515369600,,567,4.252336448598131

The story is lovely in its message that everyone, regardless of being different in some way, should be cherished and valued.

1630404,4,B00005NB93,"I was a child when this TV special first came out. I loved it then and still do. It was  not created with computer animation but with stop motion animation using detailed figures. It was just watch Christmas TV every year after its debut. Just like ""The Charlie Brown Christmas"" special and ""The Grinch who Stole Christmas"" special using Seuss' drawing style. Memorable songs and memorable stories.

My first complaint with this is  the previously mentioned stretching of the screen. It should have been done with black side borders instead to retain the proper dimensions. This was apparently someone's conscious decision to do it this way.

My second complaint is that the colors are not as vivid as they are when this is shown by a TV station.  It is apparent in the very first scene with the snowman (voiced by Burl Ives). The colors are off. Why can TV stations run a version with vivid colors but this digital version is not as vivid? I thought computers could do everything. What's up the faced colors????

Lovely heart warming story about a reindeer who is different and suffers some bullying for being different. In some way, all of us are square pegs in round holes. Being accepted for or despite our uniqueness and oddities is what creating a loving world is all about.

The monster in this story was never as scary as the wicked witch and her flying monkeys in the classic movie, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (with a young Judy Garland) which was aired on TV every Halloween season.

Dear some computer genius, please fix this TV classic to be as technically outstanding as it was in TV over fifty years ago. Sharpen those colors and get right of the horizontal picture distortion.

One star removed due to technical complaints.",1510272000,,1730,4.701986754966887
1630405,5,B00005NB93,Younger kids will get it.  Afraid millennials may not.  The program came out when I was a kid and fosters old time values and strong nostalgia for when life was more simple.

1630407,1,B00005NB93,"As the other reviewer has said, this version has been altered from the original by stretching the square 60s TV picture to fill the current rectangular TV frame.  This is always a stupid idea.  Everything looks short and wider than normal.  The giveaway is anything that would be a circle is an oval.  When the narrator is a snowman who's head should be round, and it ends with a shot of an oval moon, the distortion is perfectly obvious.  The picture could have been carefully cropped to our current width as other some older TV programs have recently been, which would require some expert care being taken and probably cost more money, but the result would be far better than this.  We've been watching this yearly on TV for over 50 years, and on video for over 30 years, we know how it's supposed to look.  This cheap video was a cheap effort by someone who thought people wouldn't be smart enough to tell the difference.  Don't reward people who think you're stupid.  Don't buy this version.  Why would you buy this inferior version with mediocre picture quality when there is a much better version that's NOT distorted?",1509753600,,1124,4.6313131313131315

1630471,5,B00005NB93,"This is the original Rankin/Bass production, a real Christmas classic. Although if you really watch it and listen to the dialogue, you can certainly tell that it was made in a different time. Frankly, the elves are really jerks, especially the supervisor who would be reported to HR for harassment of Henry in a heartbeat if he worked in a modern work environment. And Rudolph's dad is not particularly nice, playing the role of the stern, heartless father in typical 50's stereotypical fashion. It was definitely written in the era before everything become whitewashed in political correctness... which of course, makes me want to show it to my 3 year old every day all year long. She loves it. And I crack up laughing every time Yukon Cornelius licks his ice pick. Don't ask me why that's funny, it just is.",1485216000,,809,4.74468085106383

1630519,4,B00005NB93,"I was skeptical, I wasn't sure the animation would hold up to the claymation of the previous stories with Rudolph and the gang. I bought a used copy because the price was right. It was better than expected. Returning characters were familiar and well voiced, new characters were interesting and helped the story along. I held back the last star because the animation was just short of finished. There were animation details that could have been added that would have made the overall feel of it so much better. (like the edge of water interacting with land, should have had some attention to create a more reasonable interface.) Alas many of those details were not attempted and their absence was palpable, leaving this looking like the intermediate steps for some special effects footage. Overall though it was good, Animation was on a par with children's shows like ""Word World.""",1483142400,,881,4.919463087248322

From the days before commercials  that demand 25 percent of an hour time slot, this version runs for 51 glorious minutes.

I purchased a digital copy of it to enjoy today but was very quickly disappointed since the audio track is not synched very well to the video and I had to stop watching it.  Buyer beware.  I guess I'll have to dig out my DVD and blow the dust off of my player if I want to watch this today.

I'll admit it's not really any different the video quality than the regular DVD. I bought this while it was less than $8 since it was used and I could use Prime shipping. If you all ready have the regular DVD I would advise you not to upgrade. In my opinion this movie shouldn't be more than $10 since the quality is not Blu Ray quality. I think someone complained the scene where Cornelius finds peppermint is missing from the Blu Ray. That scene is included in my copy.,1451952000,,586,4.435185185185185

1630691,4,B00005NB93,"I rounded out my viewing of Christmas classics I had missed with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.  This was the final special in a collection I got recently in exchange for honest reviews.  I knew that the special expanded on the story in ways I wasn't familiar with.  Some work and some didn't, but overall it's a good special.

The story starts off in the way you would expect.  Rudolph (voiced by Billy Richards) is born to Donner (Paul Kligman).  There's just one problem, Rudolph has a nose that glows red.  They try to hide it from the other reindeer, but when it comes out, everyone shuns Rudolph.  Even Santa thinks Rudolph is flawed.

Meanwhile, we meet Hermey (Paul Soles), an elf that doesn't want to make toys.  He wants to be, gasp, a dentist.  After making a mess of things one too many times, Hermey heads out, where he meets up with Rudolph.  The two decide to run away together, but soon meet up with Yukon Cornelius (Larry Mann), a prospector.  Can they find a way to survive while avoiding the Abominable Snow Monster?

Obviously, if you are going to turn a two minute song into a 50 minute special, you are going to have to expand on the story.  Most of that works well.  Hermey and his parallel journey to Rudolph's allows for the moral of the story to be reinforced.  Yukon adds some much needed fun to the second half of the story.

On the other hand, I'm still trying to figure out why the Island of Misfit Toys appears.  Yes, it provides some nice gags, but their story is never really paid off.  The Abominable Snow Monster ties into the theme a bit more, but he could easily frighten the main audience of young kids.

The only name in the cast I recognized is Burl Ives.  He narrates as Sam the Snowman and sings a few songs, which is a real treat.  The rest of the songs were pretty bland to me.  On the other hand, the cast is great at bringing life to their Claymation characters.

Claymation isn't my favorite form of animation, and the usual herky jerky movements are here.  It's well done although not as polished as other versions of the media I have seen have been.

Which brings us to the moral of the story.  With all the talk about bullying in the news right now, it amazes me to see something with that as the main theme written almost 40 years ago.  Just proves that there is nothing new in our society today after all, doesn't it?  You can really see this piece as a dual message.  If you are being bullied, remember that you are special and the others don't know what they are talking about.  Bullies need to remember the same thing; there is something special in every one.

What bugs me a bit in this piece is that everyone but our heroes turns out to be a bully.  Even Santa gets into the act before seeing how Rudolph's differences might be useful.  It would be nice to have a wise adult character who expressed those sentiments early in the story.

But I'm probably over analyzing a special meant to turn a classic Christmas song into an annual family tradition.  Or here's a radical idea, talk it over with your kids yourself after you've enjoyed it.

Even with the flaws, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a fun Christmas tale.  I can certainly see why it is still so loved today.",1431475200,,3228,4.406779661016949

1630802,5,B00005NB93,"This DVD is a digitally remastered one done in 2010 but it is actually the real 1964 version and states that when you open up the ""special"" index at the first download on your player.  The cover says ""The ORIGINAL Christmas Classic"", and this is honorable and true.  Mine plays very clear on the Blu-ray player even though this item is not a Blu-ray edition disk.  You get to take a quiz about the story itself, there are two other cartoons one of which has Kelly and Mr. Trump on it and the other is female singers, plus you can set up subtitles in English, Spanish or French which is great since other editions never provided that option.  This is 52 minutes for the regular Rudolph story and it was great!  I own the other Limited Keepsake Edition The Original Christmas Classics 7 Holiday Favorites Set made remastered in 2007 which has Rudolph also but this 2010 is a better DVD because the set does not give subtitles.  I'm so happy I got this better Rudolph!!  I was sorry to see so many bad reviews and disappointments with the 50th Anniversary edition and was glad I didn't give in to getting that one.

1630804,2,B00005NB93,"There are good and bad points regarding this product.  I will touch on both.

First the good.  It's Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition.  It contains two discs, a DVD and Blu-Ray, plus a Legend Storybook.  It's also a Walmart exclusive.

Now the bad.  The DVD is fine.  The Blu-Ray is seriously flawed.  In a collector's edition of a production, you would expect everything to be perfect.  Not so here.  On the back of the packaging, it says the Blu-Ray features DTS-HD Master Audio.  This is repeated on the label of the Blu-Ray disc.  Upon playing the Blu-Ray, there is NO DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack.

If you want this because it's the anniversary edition of Rudolph, buy it by all means.  However don't be fooled into thinking the Blu-Ray has DTS-HD Master Audio.",1419552000,,802,4.837037037037037

1630830,5,B00005NB93,"When the storm of the century hits, Santa decides to cancel Christmas. Sam the Snowman tells us the story of a young red-nosed reindeer named Rudolph who will be the one to save Christmas; he just doesn't know it. Rudolph tries to hide his glowing nose so he can participate in the yearly reindeer games. During the games his nose becomes exposed to all the other reindeer and he is quickly banished from the games. It's at this point Rudolph meets up with Hermey the Elf who's had some bad luck of his own. It seems that Hermey would rather be a dentist than an elf and together the two misfits set out for an adventure.

Rudolph and Hermey soon meet up with Yukon Cornelius, the wacky prospector searching for gold. Along the way they also encounter the Abominable Snowman and find an island of misfit toys. Rudolph gets a brilliant idea about the misfit toys and promises them he can get Santa to help. When Rudolph returns to the North Pole on Christmas Eve, he learns Santa's sleigh is fogged in. When Santa looks over at Rudolph and spots that shining beacon of a honker, he gets a very bright idea!

Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a timeless Christmas classic that brings back so many wonderful childhood memories for me. It came out days before I was born and growing up in the 60's it's always been a part of my life. Rudolph has been televised every year at Christmas time and I still get excited when it comes on. At 50 years old with no modern special effects or CGI, Rudolph still manages to entertain.

Today was a dream come true for me. I was fortunate enough to meet the one and only Paul Soles at the Windsor Comic Con. For those of you who don't know, Paul Soles was the voice of ""Hermey"" the Elf in Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. He's 84 years old and as sharp as can be. Believe it or not, this was his first ever convention of any kind. He said that he never knew that these conventions existed and he was clearly overwhelmed by the support at the show. Mr. Soles is one of the most gracious men I have ever had the pleasure to meet and it truly was an amazing experience. I was able to purchase a 12"" x 18"" Rudolph print that was created for the comic con and have it signed by ""Hermey"" himself.

As for the 50th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD combo release in terms of picture and sound quality, I think it could have been much better. I found the picture quality to be marginally better on the Blu-ray than the previous DVD release and the sound is pretty consistent throughout. There are a couple different sound options in the menu section of the Blu-ray. I don't know where the source material came from but it definitely could use some proper restoration. I believe when you release a 50th anniversary edition of a classic, the studio should spare no expense; clearly that wasn't done.

In my opinion this release was a missed opportunity by those involved to bring fans a spectacular 50th anniversary edition with tons of extras and one that they deserve. I bought my 50th anniversary edition with special gold embossed packaging containing a built in story booklet and Blu-ray/DVD combo. Sadly the booklet was already torn and the DVD scratched. Fortunately the Blu-ray was not damaged and it played without any problems. I returned my damaged set for a new one without any problem. There are some nice special features included that small children will probably enjoy but nothing to really get excited about.

1630833,4,B00005NB93,"I wasn't sure about this after reading some of the 1-star reviews, but it's really not that bad. The PQ isn't ""top notch stuff"" but it is comparably better than the DVD. I watched the ""Silver and Gold"" part three times, listening closely for the so-called glitch. It might be there, but occurs so quickly that I didn't notice it in any of the three times I tried to hear it.

Also for those complaining about ""Fame and Fortune"" that was NOT part of the original airing in 1964. It was in the 1965 re-broadcast and definitely not ""way into the 90s"" as some on here claimed. I have the official VHS copy that was sold in the 1980s and ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" was there instead of ""Fame and Fortune"" - Anyone under the age of 40 probably never heard the ""Fame and Fortune"" song, other than the YouTube clip. I think they either like to complain, or they are old enough to remember the 1965 airing of the movie, and haven't watched it since.

Don't let the 1-star reviews discourage you from getting this. It's just fine.

Also, there ARE bonuses (some of the reviews on here say there aren't). One of the bonus features that's new to this release is called ""Rudolph Unwrapped"" and it's great for people that enjoy trivia. It's 50 little tidbits about Rudolph and some information you may not have known before.",1417564800,,1311,4.454166666666667

My mom has watched the movie since the 60's and she has never missed the movie yet on TV. From Rudolph's Red nose to the awesome character known as Yukon Cornelius and the Scary Abominable Snow Monster who scared me every time I watched the movie. This is bye far the greatest movie any kid could watch to get ready for Christmas. I love movie so much that I've collected all the toy figuring's and small statues. Its a great classic in every person who loves Christmas should buy this movie.

1630843,5,B00005NB93,"The 50th anniversary edition of Rudolph is probably as close to the original as we will ever get. There are several reviews that are complaining about what is included and what's not included. The fact is this edition, with the exception of the Island of misfit toys tag at the end, is pretty much as it aired in 1964. Beginning in 1965 edits were made including dropping Yukon finally finding the Peppermint mine (an edit that never made sense because you never find out why he's always licking his ax). Also swapped out was the ""We're A Couple Of Misfits"" replaced with ""Fame And Fortune"", a instrumental bridge of ""We Are Santas Elves"" was also edited out which was removed to make room for the misfits ending. All of these edits are back as they originally aired. The only thing ""cut"" from this release is the 1965 addtion of ""Fame And Fortune"". That's not a big loss, if you've never noticed the trees in the back ground for that song have no decorations because that footage was done rather quickly to make it in time for the '65 broadcast. Nothing else is missing, in fact you actually get more on this release than you'll get if you catch it on TV.
 Yes it would be nice to have better extras, the original commercials, even the original end credits, rather than these rather dull extras, but it is what it is.  The show itself though is as complete as it can be.",1417132800,,1371,4.45816733067729

This edition was released for one year when Rankin and Bass decided to replace the lame couple of misfit extended version with the better Fame and Fortune song. The Fame and Fortune version ran on television for over 40 years and is the version most people know and love.  This stinker has only been around at best for 4 years, first way way back, then with the restoration and release by idiots.  There is ABSOLUTELY no reason both version can't be included but for some reason they keep printing this one.  Rankin and Bass improved the TV special when they removed the extended misfit song, it wasn't cut to include more commercial time for the network, it was cut because it sounds awful.  I was alive when it was first aired, and new when it was changed and it was changed for the better.  I guess I'll keep hoping someone at Classicmedia will get a Brain and give us the true version America enjoyed for over 40 years, this ain't it!!",1416960000,,1065,4.380710659898477

1630851,1,B00005NB93,"2014 is a noteworthy year for this, the reigning king of Christmas specials - not only is it the 50th Anniversary for Rudolph but also the unfortunate passing of its creator, Arthur Rankin. As such, one would think this golden year would produce a no-holds-barred loving tribute to commemorate both events. But those awful terrible cheapskates at Dreamworks have gone the same penny-pinching route as their predecessors, Classic Media. Unless you find the lure of this new cover too irresistible to withstand, there really is NO reason to pick up this wasted opportunity. So many mouth watering possibilities were at their disposal - the original end credits IN COLOR, various cuts of the film, excised songs, an introduction by Arthur Rankin himself, original TV promos, original GE bumper commercials featuring the Animagic characters hoisting GE products and so much more  - but guess how many of these made it to this ""Golden Anniversary Bluray""? None!!!! .... Instead, we get a few awful cheap extras that appeal to absolutely no one AND the same remaster that was out on the last Bluray release, complete with a skip in ""Silver and Gold"" - one that was fixed for the DVD release over a decade ago! Completely unforgivable!",1416441600,,1228,4.990243902439024

1630856,1,B00005NB93,"I'm forced to agree with many of the reviews. This is worse than a double dip. It pretends to be an 50th Anniversary Edition (Blu-ray) with extra features. The extra features are a joke. It is the same poor transfer we have had in the past. No improvement and certainly no extra footage.  Let CRITERION have a crack at this title. I'll bet they could dig up some worthwhile goodies to honor this TV classic. At least the older DVD version of Rudolph had The ""Fame & Fortune"" song, TV Promo spot and a feature with Arthur Rankin.",1415404800,,528,4.387755102040816
1630857,1,B00005NB93,"Ugh! I'd blame The Grinch for making this 50th Anniversary Edition of Rudolph, but that would be an insult to him. Because surely a heart much smaller than the Grinch's was responsible for this huge disappointment. And I'm not convinced the beancounters at Dreamworks have any heart at all.

Could there be any show more deserving of a full-out, no expense spared box set with all the goodies for its 50th anniversary than this beloved holiday classic? I think not. And there are countless millions of fans--50 years worth of them!--who'd happily pay a premium price for that kind of special edition if it had been done right.

What we've gotten instead is this cynical money-grab in which the absolute minimum effort was expended to slap a ""50th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" label on the box. (Which begs the question: Collector of WHAT?) So here goes...

NO NEW REMASTER: This is the same blu-ray remaster from 2008, complete with the dust, scratches, wavering colors and other artifacts that they failed to remove back then, along with the ""Sliver and Gold"" audio glitch. Really Dreamworks? You couldn't expend the effort to finally restore Rudolph to its original, pristine condition?

AWFUL EXTRAS: They're mostly SO bad, they're an embarrassment--better to have not included them at all. You get:

* The Rudolph Pop-Up Book: A Sam the Snowman impersonator narrates a heavily abbreviated version of the Rudolph story, accompanied by super low budget animation of a pop-up book with the characters.

* Sam the Snowman's Sing-Alongs: The two scenes from the show featuring the songs Holly Jolly Christmas and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer are simply replayed here, except the lyrics are superimposed on them. But it gets better: since there are two songs, this is actually listed as two separate ""extras."" Wow, how generous!

* Learn to Draw: Some Dreamworks animation artist teaches you how to draw three of the characters from the show. 'Cause you were really hoping for that as an extra, right?

* Rudolph Unwrapped: It looks like Dreamworks spent about a dollar to make this, but at least it's entertaining: this extra simply reveals a series of fun and little known facts about the show. Ex: do you know the five different breeds of dogs that pull Yukon Cornelius's sled? I didn't. Or that the time never changes on Sam the Snowman's watch throughout the show--it's always 2 o'clock.

THAT. IS. IT. Unfortunately, you don't have much choice if you want a blu-ray of Rudolph. The first blu-ray, which uses the same remaster, contained no extras at all and sells for more than this 50th Anniversary edition. The best version I've seen for extras is the 2002 Sony Wonder DVD, which has about 45 minutes worth of them. That's also a very good quality remaster, which looks pretty darned good when uprezzed via your blu-ray player or television to high def.

So Happy 50th Birthday, Rudolph! This is no way to treat an elderly reindeer!

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a purchase decision.",1415318400,,3053,4.897286821705427
1630858,5,B00005NB93,"Great release of an old television classic. It's absolutely absurd and idiotic that one reviewer found this film too scary, but judging by her other reviews she's definitely got more than one screw loose anyway. As for other reviewers that have given over exaggerated negative reviews for such silly crap as extras, get a clue this show was produced in the 60's when nobody was concerned about keeping track of stuff like commercials.",1415145600,,434,4.958904109589041

The remastering looks nice, although not any different from the last Blu Ray release. Where is the alternate song of ""Fame And Fortune""? This was included in a previous DVD version. Where are the original broadcast elements for the GE Fantasy Hour? Where are the original GE commercials featuring the characters? The soundtrack is in stereo as is presented on CD? Why not add alternate listening options? Why not give us the original 1964 cut, the 1965 cut and then the current cut? Original promos? Promos through the years?

So, here we are four years later with a chance for Classic Media/DreamWorks to correct the mistake and give us a quality 50th anniversary release and they released the same thing, with a tiny add-on or two for ""bonus"" features. No classic TV commercials from the original airing, or anything worthwhile like that. No re-mastering of the show to fix the song issue.

The blurb on Amazon says there are no special features, but there are.  There are some animated songs, a Rudolph quiz, and the movie in both a Spanish and a French version (which were extremely interesting to watch).

This is the best Christmas special and it is not CGI.  It is a heartwarming movie and always signals the beginning of the holidays.  Baby Rudolph will always be one of my favorite characters - his voice is adorable.  A great treat for children of all ages!",1387843200,,585,4.523809523809524

Don't you realize that they wrote, produced, and performed all of the voices??!! You know, Jay-Z wrote the famous tune by the same name; in fact, Burl Ives is really just Jay-Z in white-face. How do you expect minorities to take their deserved place in the building of American culture if we don't let foreign interests like Sony help them rewrite themselves into it?--sort of like the wild west getting tamed by a black cowboy named Django. I really hope nobody buys any of this crap, and that Sony goes broke and has to sell its entertainment interests to someone who can maintain the integrity of American history and classic American entertainment features.

By the way, if you can get the unedited, non-Sony version without Destiny's Child, this is, of course, a five. However, I'll bet those clearly-superior, less-sickening versions without the hip-hop will be more-and-more difficult to find, so I would suggest searching for your own copy now.",1387497600,,1068,5.102857142857143

I actually saw this wonderful holiday classic when it first aired on TV decades ago and have grown up with seeing it on TV ever since at  Christmastime.  It is a sweet holiday classic taken from the children's storybook of the same name.  The stop motion is well done and the actors who voice the parts of the characters did an excellent job!  I also love the Snowman narrator, played by Burl Ives, who also sings beautifully in the film.  I know my grand niece will love it as I know her parents will, too.

1630945,5,B00005NB93,"Let's face it: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has been an iconic symbol of the American-made stop-motion animated Christmas special. This 1964 classic carries a special message of forgiveness and kindness, as a tormented Rudolph finds his place in the world after having run away from his peers. Seeing what their actions did to poor Rudolph, they come to accept him as an equal, and perhaps admire his gift of a shiny nose that saved Christmas. Burl Ives is the perfect narrator, who sings two signature Christmas songs, SILVER AND GOLD and HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS. This special has all the right sights and sounds for its kind. Do yourself a favor and purchase this DVD for a nostalgic look at the origin of the stop-motion television Christmas special.",1386374400,,753,4.937007874015748

1630949,5,B00005NB93,"As I watch this movie for over the 50th time, have to laugh more and more. The movie is fun, yet have to wonder how Santa tolerated the elf and reindeer bullying. Reindeer tease poor Rudolf because of his nose. The elves tease poor Herbie because he doesn't want to make toys, and the head elf makes him work through his ten minute break, a true labor law violation.

The Land of Misfit Toys is quite the site, can't help but to blame the elves for such mistakes. And why santa never knew about this place, since he knows everything and everyplace.

The Abominable Snowman is more funny than scary, and is very entertaining.

Always a classic and the flaws in the plot have holes bigger than the Grand Canyon, but that adds to the fun.

A great way to enjoy a night by the fireplace with the family and friends.",1385596800,,811,4.3509933774834435

1630963,5,B00005NB93,"While I gave Frosty the Snowman 5 stars and feel it deserved it,Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is a classic to behold and EASILY the best of the Christmas specials of the 1960's. A good place to start is Rudolph himself. Rudolph is wonderfully voiced by Billie May Richards and is an easy character to root for right from the start. We see a wonderful character progression from Rudolph being mistreated by everyone in Christmastown to him being on the run to him growing older and realizing he has to face his troubles rather than run from them and that he must go home to the big moment where Santa says ""Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight.""  Rudolph's journey is just fantastic. What the producers have also done with this show is expanded on the misfit theme and added other characters not in the song to obtain a reasonable length show. There's a misfit elf and a wonderful collection of ""misfit toys"" on the Island of Misfit toys. I especially like the train with square wheels on its caboose. The idea for the misfit toys was bloody brilliant! And then there's the music. All the music throughout this show is wonderful. But I especially love Holly Jolly Christmas and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Not many people know that Holly Jolly Christmas was originally written for the purpose of being included in this show and it's still one of the best Christmas songs there is. And Burl Ives's performance of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is far superior to the Gene Autry version of the song.  Everything about Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is wonderful and classic. I watch this show 2-3 times every December,including every Christmas Eve night. And last November I purchased the mp3 Versions of Burl Ives Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and 3 mp3 versions of Holly Jolly Christmas,including Burl Ives. Rudolph the Red Nosed is a timeless and classic Christmas special that can't be anything but 5 stars. :)",1370476800,,1946,4.720588235294118

There are a couple of extra music videos that I don't particularly care for, but how many people acutally go through all the extras on a regular baisis?  The actually movie is the original version that has the song ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" instead of ""Fame and Fourtune"", which was added the year after the original was released.  I actually perfer this as it guides the theme of the movie toward overcoming obstacles, and being yourself.  In my opinion, the ""Fame and Fortune"" song completely changes the moral of the the show.

The CGI was amateurish compared to more modern offerings, but considering the time period, it is not so bad.  The original Rudolph is beloved because...it is a ""classic"" and had cool animation for the time period, not because it was an example of particularly brilliant storytelling... It is really just a lame feel good kid's Christmas program, nothing more, nothing less.  Older kids will pick it apart and tear it to shreds; little kids will love it.

We've been doing this for thirteen years, and I wasn't too happy with changing to DVDs because I'm an old-fashioned kind of gal and I like to stick to tradition. But I bought it under my mom's insistence. So we put it in this morning, and damn it if I was expecting the same movie. Do not edit a good thing! Why would you replace Fame and Fortune??? What is the reasoning?!?! We were severely disappointed, and now I've read some of these reviews and I'm really upset. If you like your movies as you grew up with them, don't buy this.

1631038,3,B00005NB93,"I just watched this, and for those of us who grew up watching the Rankin-Bass specials of the 60s and 70s, this is no Rankin-Bass.  Most of the characters have the same general look to them, but the newer, smoother rendering and animation loses the warmth and nuance the characters and setting used to have.  I also have to tell you retro-fans...and I don't quite know how to break this to you...the Snowman neither looks like nor sounds anything like Burl Ives.

I found the story itself to be too long and drawn out.  I actually watched this on TV...the run time was 1:30 with commercials, and I didn't think it was very entertaining at all for the first hour.  At around the one hour mark, the story did pick up, and I do have to say the last parts and the ending weren't bad.

To sum up, if you are one of the kids who religiously started checking the TV Guide every holiday season to see when Rudolph and your other faves would air on one of the three or four channels you had for fear of missing it for an entire year, this one is going to be mildly entertaining for you at best.

finally the restored version that first aired in 1965.  Make  sure you are buying the disc with only the Rudolph Classic.  The box has Rudolph's giant face on the cover
and a small circle next to his nose with a green trim and the red text saying The Original Christmas Classic.

the running time on the back is 52 minutes.

I almost fainted when Cornelius lifted his ice pick and shouted PEPPERMINT!  I couldn't believe it.

in the special features menu on the tv  screen (it doesn't mention it anywhere on the box), you will see the FAME and FORTUNE song!!  For Real!

if you can get past the Destiny's Child video clip.  And guess what?  You can.  Just toggle past it down to Fame and Fortune.
So finally after 47 years, we get to see it restored.  And the colors are beautiful as is the video itself...  You will notice little extra moments here and there.

The one that really stuck out for me was as Rudolph and Santa are taking off, we cut to Rudolph's Father, Mother and girlfriend watching and then the girl says
in a very odd quiet way ""my hero"" then Mom utters the  same phrase also in a weirdly whispered way.  Then Father shouts ""thats my boy""
It is directly after this odd moment that the Yukon Cornelius famous Peppermint Discovery scene is shown, so pay attention!

Now if only they can find the missing Spider Pit Scene from the 1935 King Kong.",1354579200,,1373,4.376984126984127

The songs: timeless.  Burl Ives crooning in his warm voice makes this winer wonderland a cozy place to hang out.
The animation: creative.  Eclectic.  They don't make them like this any more and that's too bad.  From the salt used as water fizzle to the black gum drop used as Rudolph's temporary nose this movie has more charm that a 100 CGI flicks.
The characters: relatable and wild.  From the elf that wants to be a dentist instead of a toymaker to that great, white terrifying furball to Yukon Cornelius and his taste for snow.

1631114,4,B00005NB93,"If you were alive when RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER debuted as a Christmas television special back in '64, you may recall being intrigued by it simply by dint of its elaboration of the events potrayed in Gene Autry's well-known song and in the various Golden Book and comic book editions that had been kicking around throughout the 50s and early 60s.  (Less well known--if not totally UNKNOWN--at that time would have been the orignial 1939 story by Robert L. May.)  Nowadays, of course, kids grow up with both the song and the now annually broadcast special and probably don't really have an inkling of the history of the tale.

But literal minded kid that I was, I remember being a little perplexed that Rudolph's father was DONNER in the animated version.  Everything else I'd ever read (including the annual comic book edtions) suggested that Rudolph and Donner were simply, well, TEAMmates--and contemporaries.  I recall, as well, having some ambivalence about the Hermey subplot.  Yes, it drove home the ""misfit"" theme of the story by providing Rudolph with an actual friend and kindred spirit, but, I mean, c'mon, an elf who wants to be a DENTIST??  Shouldn't they just be magically protected from something as mundane as tooth decay to begin with?

But like most 60s kids, I was still kinda taken with the production, whatever my reservations.  However you tell it, the RUDOLPH saga is a classic ""Ugly Duckling"" story, a genre just about every kid identifies with on some level.  (Who doesn't feel misunderstood and unappreciated?)  And in an era when anti-bullying messages are proliferating (and,  I sincerely hope, are being heard),  it does a body good to remember one such classic tale from an earlier era.

Some kids may be taken aback to learn that, in this version, even Santa is insensitive (AND, oddly enough, kinda SKINNY most of the time, 'til Mrs. Claus fattens him up anyway).  Santa's initial reaction is to dismiss Rudolph as a potential drafts-reindeer, and rather summarily at that.  But even in the original song, come to think of it, there's no indication that Santa's interest in Rudolph is anything but utilitarian.  You never saw him scolding the other reindeer for not letting ""poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games."" If it hadn't been for that foggy Christmas Eve...

I've often wondered if the stop motion animation of this version of RUDOLPH might not seem too primitive and awkward for the current crop of tykes out there, weaned as they are on whizzbang computer generated special effects.  Well, a few years ago, I watched the DVD with my niece and nephew, and they were captivated with it.  That was heartening,  RUDOLPH is a warm-hearted, compassionate tale.  It's good to know that it still speaks to children.

PS--Oh, yeah, and the kids get to discover Burl Ives' songs too.  Love me some Burl Ives.",1324771200,,2846,4.88125

1631118,4,B00005NB93,"Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer is the first Rankin/Bass holiday special, and only their second TV special ever (the first being Return to Oz). Still the all-time champ, Rudolph is the longest-running holiday special in television history, running annually since 1964, mostly on CBS and NBC. You can get hung up on the modest scope of the stop-motion Animagic figures, elemental sets and limited effects, but you can't deny its power. There is simply an engaging quality about the production that charms every generation, regardless of how high-tech things become. Production designer Anthony Peters deserves more attention for his creations, which we see almost everywhere today -- even the lettering is widely imitated.

At its core, the story is about being ""different,"" and how those differences become strengths. For a show aimed at children's, the characters can be downright cruel (this particular Santa, besides appearing to have an eating disorder, shows such displeasure he'd be right at home sitting next to Donald Trump on The Apprentice).

If you view the special in its historic context, during the civil rights movement, suddenly Rudolph is a victim of prejudice -- Clarice's father won't let his daughter be seen with him. Maybe that's reading too much into the story, but it makes one wonder if some members of '60s households realized they were watching or just dismissed it as a cute kid's show. Probably the latter.

As a cultural icon, you can't dismiss the influence this single special had on so much that followed it. Many of today's greatest names in animation have either cited it as a favorite (along with other Rankin/Bass films) or slipped its lore into their own work. Like The Wizard of Oz, elements of Romeo Muller's script have become part of our vernacular, from Charlie in the Box to Hermie the Dentist.

On Blu-ray, of course you can see the handmade quality of the animation in all its glory -- as well as details you may have missed, like Clarice's touch of blush or Fireball's freckles. AND, the long-omitted ""Peppermint mine"" scene has been included. If you've ever wondered if there was more to Yukon Cornelius' quest for riches, you'll see it just before Santa goes off to pick up the misfit toys.

For more about Rankin/Bass and Rudolph, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.

NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Rudolph, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.",1322352000,,2516,4.96437054631829
1631119,5,B00005NB93,"Always a great holiday classic, this special strikes a chord with anyone who has ever been rejected for being different and longs for acceptance on their own terms.  I should know, having been picked on most of my life for having undiagnosed ADD.  Rudolph is the son of the famous Donnar, who is ashamed to find out his son has a red shiny nose that glows and gives off a horrific, wailing beep, so he tries to hide it by packing mud over it when a visiting, arrogant Santa disapproves.  Well, shame on Santa, and shame on the others--especially the reindeer clique--who picked on him.  They don't even take into consideration how well he can fly, or that he is a good ""person"" with a good heart.  All they see is his nose.  Fortunately, like any misfit, Rudolph has some allies in his mother, Clarice, Ukorn Cornelius, and Herbie the elf--a veritable misfit himself in Santa's workshop--who wants to be ""a...a dentist.""

Due to lack of acceptance, Rudolph and Herbie set off on their own to find their special calling, and meet up with gold prospector Ukorn and his pack of sled dogs.  Ukorn knows no fear, and is the only one who isn't afraid of the Abominable Snowman.  PCers lighten up!  Herbie removing his teeth was better than killing him, and the Abominable was indiscriminate about where he got his lunch.  Was Herbie removing his teeth awful in comparison?  I think not.

The group lands on the Island of Misfit toys, ruled by a great and kindly lion king who wants Santa to find homes for them, and rightly so.  Everyone wants to be accepted and loved for who they are, don't they?  That is the lesson in this wonderful yuletide story for young and old alike, and it always puts most of us in the Christmas mood.  Did you ever notice how people are more accepting of those who are different around the holidays, and then they revert back to the way they treated them previously?  This story is about how anyone can change--even the ""bumble""--that acceptance is a worldwide theme, and that's what the lesson is in this wonderful old classic.  It doesn't mean you should only make exceptions on the holidays, however, but you should be accepting all year long.  The spirit of Christmas should last throughout the year in kindness and tolerance of difference, which makes this appropriate for children of all ages.  It's a great lesson full of good old classic songs, and Burl Ives makes a great snowman narrator.

It's obvious Rankin Bass put a lot of care into this one, and I also recommend Santa Claus is Comin' to Town along with it.  They don't make specials like this anymore, and I know 3/4 of the dialog due to repeated watching!  Good old Christmas classics never go out of style when they're done right, and that's the reason adults still love to watch this one with their kids.  Pass this one on to your kids and emphasize the lesson here about being generous to your fellow man and animal.  Also, have a happy holiday!

Dedicated to the memory of my late brother Mark, who always loved this when we were kids and beyond.
Sincerely, Carlisle.",1321315200,,3062,4.593001841620626

The story is a simple, sweet tale of frienship, trust, and overcoming problems.  It shows how to have confidence in yourself and be able to help others in the same situation.  Everyone has a place in society regardless of how they look (Rudoplh, misfit toys) or what they do (Herbie, the elf who wants to be a dentist).

1631169,3,B00005NB93,"How you feel about the blu-ray release of this deservedly beloved Christmas classic will depend a lot on how you've been viewing Rudolph up 'til now. If you've been watching the DVD on a standard def TV--or watching it on broadcast television--then the blu-ray may strike you as a revelation, perhaps like seeing it for the first time, because there's no question that it trounces an all standard def set-up.

But if you, like me, have been watching a DVD (I have the excellent 2002 version on Sony Wonder), then uprez'd to high def via one of the better blu-ray players and/or high def television, then this blu-ray will come as a disappointment in more ways than one. It's not that it's bad, per se, but you will see virtually no difference from what you've been watching. That's a real shame, too, because you can't help but wonder what might have been had they given Rudolph the loving care remastering job he so deserved for his first appearance on blu-ray.  Instead, they simply used the existing master with its scratches, dust and occasionally wavering colors.

I'll never understand this Scrooge-like approach to blu-ray for a beloved, popular title like Rudolph which will unquestionably sell very well. The investment to do a top-notch remastering job is minimal on a cost-per-disc basis when averaged out over a high volume of sales.

That brings us to the second disappointment: the extras. Simply put, there aren't any. My old DVD copy from '02 runs 135 minutes with extras. This new blu-ray is 52 minutes.

How unfortunate that Rudolph's debut on high-def was handled by stingy bean counters who said ""Bah, humbug!"" to giving this title the same level of devotion shown to it by fans for almost 50 years.",1292371200,,1719,4.813559322033898
1631170,1,B00005NB93,"It didn't take more than two minutes for me to notice that the soundtrack on this DVD was a second or two out of sync. As a result the dialogue starts before the characters start to move their mouths and then ends and the mouths continue to move!!! I hoped that at some point the audio would get back on track, but from beginning to end it never improves, making the whole show painful to watch.

HOW on earth could so obvious a defect have been overlooked? It is outrageous that this sub-standard product made it past quality control and was passed on to unsuspecting customers. Sadly, this is not the only problem with this version of Rudolph. But since the issue with the audio is so completely egregious there is simply no point in taking the time to comment on anything else.",1292025600,,780,4.454545454545454
1631181,5,B00005NB93,"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer is indeed the most marvelous Christmas film ever!  It is one of many splendid animated films written by a great man named Romeo Muller.  Rudolph is doubtless his best-loved work.  I remember watching the film as a child, delighted and enraptured by the story that it told.  Do you remember?  Sam the Snowman as narrator (voiced and sung in the performance of a lifetime by Burl Ives); Rudolph the misfit and rejected reindeer; Rudolph's friend, Hermie the Elf, also a misfit because he doesn't like to make toys but wants to be a dentist; Yukon Cornelius, the prospector who befriends them both; the Abominable Snowmonster of the North (whom Yukon, in prospector slang, invariably calls a ""bumble""); the Island of Misfit Toys, and its winged lion king; and many other characters and story threads.  The presentation, interweaving, and resolution of all of these elements is positively Shakespearean in deftness, wit, poetic beauty and brevity of expression, depth, pathos, joy, moral instruction, and the sense that all ends as indeed it should.  Grounded in a deep and sparkling love of all creation, these qualities characterize all of Romeo Muller's films.  Merry Christmas!",1291852800,,1209,5.164102564102564

1631184,4,B00005NB93,"""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" has been a Christmas classic since its first presentation on television in 1964, and has nicely survived the transitions to VHS, DVD, and now HD formats.

""Rudolph"" is the story of a young reindeer growing up in Christmastown, who is shunned and bullied by other reindeer for his shiny nose.  Rudolph leaves Christmastown with another misfit, an elf named Hermy, who wants to be a dentist rather than make toys.  The pair team up with Yukon Cornelius, a wacky but savy prospector, to explore the Great North.  The trio will dodge the Abomidable Snowman and find the Island of Misfit Toys.  It will take a family crisis to bring them back to Christmastown, just in time for a big blizzard and a chance to save Christmas...

""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" has lost none of its charm and wisdom through an annual retelling.  The songs are still fun, the characters are charming, and the moral of accepting others is as relevant as ever was.  Highly recommended to children of all ages.",1291161600,,1017,4.804597701149425

When Sam the Snowman sings ""Silver and Gold"" which is my absolute favorite song in this classic TV special, one word is lost as apparently there was a skip in the old film elements when this was transferred. Instead of singing,""Everyone wishes FOR silver and gold..."" it says, ""Everyone wishes...silver and gold."" That is really the only defect I found but it was a bummer. Was there no way to simply take the song from a CD (it has been released on CD) or somehow restore it a bit better? Also, there are no extras whatsoever. I found that to be a bit cheap, a bare bones release. But for the picture quality, if you love this classic Christmas special as I do, it is still very nice to own in High Definition.

1631190,4,B00005NB93,"Founded in 1960 by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass, Rankin/Bass followed in the footsteps of such stop-motion animators as Ray Harryhousen--but with less budget.  Although the company made quite a few feature films over the years, with the 1967 THE MAD MONSTER PARTY probably the best known, they were most famous for their seasonal television specials.  These included the 1964 RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER, which has been televised on network television every year at Christmas since its debut.

Obviously inspired by the song by the 1939 song, the story veers in several creative directions.  Not only does Rudolph have a glowing red nose, his father attempts to conceal it, and even Santa rejects Rudolph because of it.  This story line is combined with the tale of elf Hermey, who dislikes making toys and wants to be a dentist.  Rejected for who they are, Rudolph and Hermey flee the north pole--and eventually stumble upon the Island of Misfit Toys, where unwanted toys are gathered and will remain until some little girl or boy actually wants one of them.  Still later, the pair encounter Yukon Cornelius, who helps them defeat the ""Bumble,"" a version of the abominable snowman.  Rudolph and Hermey return home, where both now find acceptance; Yukon Cornelius joins them, leading the Bumble, who he has converted into a helpful beast.  When a violent snow storm threatens to postpone Christmas, Rudolph uses his nose to light Santa's way, and after a quick stop to pick up the misfit toys for a happily-ever-after Christmas delivery, Santa is on his way.

The stop-motion is hardly on the same level as that of KING KONG or EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, but it has a certain innocent charm, and the puppets are truly smile inducing.  The show also includes a number of truly enjoyable Christmas songs, two of which are performed by Burl Ives as the narrating snowman and which went on to a broader popularity: ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" and ""Sliver and Gold.""  The DVD release is not pristine, but it is extremely good, and children of all ages will enjoy the show.  The same can't be said for the Beyonce video, which really has no place here and should be skipped.

 Watching this cute production is an annual ritual in which I, like many, have indulged since childhood. It doesn't seem like Christmas without it. It's rather amusing that in recent years, stores have carried dolls of the beloved figures, which should further promote the film's charming legacy.
 We follow Rudolph from his birth as the son of Santa's(Stan Francis) sleigh team member, Donner( Paul Kligman), and his mate(Peg Dixon), through formative years where the long-hidden secret of his neon nose is revealed, the prejudice he faces, the consolation he receives from the Reindeer Coach's daughter, Clarice(Janet Orenstein), and the delightful friends he finds on his way to self-discovery, such as Yukon Cornelius (Larry D. Mann), and King Moonracer. Even the Aboninable Snowman finds his purpose in the course of this tale, which has captured the hearts, minds, and imaginations of children for 45 years, and whose magic, brightness and delight will continue to do so for many more years to come!",1260489600,,1395,5.114035087719298

The plot concerns the adventures of an unlikely pair:  a disgruntled elf who would rather be a dentist, and Rudolph, who is ostracized from the reindeer community on account of his luminous nose.

What makes it particularly excellent is the theme:  ultimately it's not about the danger that ""Christmas might be canceled!"" but instead about inclusion and the feeling of home, which is what Christmas oughta be about, dagnabit!  The warmth and purpose of the holiday extends to those who consider themselves unloved and outcast misfits.

While the show might seem like a random series of nonsequitur adventures, they are all woven together by this overarching theme.  The entire show is rightly regarded as a classic, and not just because it was made so many years ago.  Musically, visually, thematically:  it all hangs together.

1631265,5,B00005NB93,"This stop animation special ultimately is a compelling allegory about the need to deinstutionalize children with disabilities, for the benefit of them--and society.

A reindeer named Rudolph has a physical difference from his peers. Barred from attending reindeer school because of this difference, he ultimately discovers an island where 'misfit toys' with various deformities (a choo-choo with square wheels..etc) have been involuntarily isolated.

Technically they are among their own kind so they should be happy, but they are instead gloomy. Unable to fulfil the role of what a toy SHOULD be doing, they instead feel lonely and punnished--wanting to escape the island and travel with Santa. They know that if they were like 'normal' toys, children would play with them.

Joined by an elf-dentist named Hermey and a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (who does not add much to the story), Rudolph himself saves the day. And he maintains the love of a doe named Clarice who had always loved him for who he was, even when his own family was publically ashamed of his difference.

Finally, it's important to note that Fireball and the other reindeer who teased him as 'children' could not even make Santa's prestigious team. In the end, Rudolph himself enables Santa to continue bringing toys to children around the world.",1229126400,,1321,5.158878504672897

This story of misfits finding their rightful place in the world is just the Christmas tale solitary children the world over need to hear. Its beautiful and subversive message feels all the more heartfelt because we receive it through the delicately hand-wrought images of stop-motion animation. There's something especially touching in the craft behind the images: you can feel the resonance from the touch of each person who posed these figure, frame after frame.

A beautiful story, a wonderful early-60s design aesthetic and a talented group of voice actors make this feel as important today as it did when I first saw it in 1964.

Most importantly, it restores the original ""We're A Couple of Misfits"" song to its proper place.

1631289,1,B00005NB93,"In the prominent, well-known, and award-winning movie Rudolf the Red-nosed Reindeer, FHE, (which is) also known as Family Home Entertainment, presents the most famous cartoon of Christmas. With all of its history and fanfare one would not expect a disappointment. Incessantly and irritatingly, though, Burl Ives wrecks the film as he interrupts, dances, and sings throughout all of the key moments in the movie! Perhaps singing and dancing make for a family-friendly movie, but at what expense? Leaving this narrative without any content rating whatsoever, the producers of the film neglected also to provide any content because they were more concerned about its suitability.  Rudolf the reindeer relinquished its' ratings. To be fair though, the qualities that are lacking for some must have been heavily compensated for in the eyes of others in order to receive award-winning film status.  If any movie escaped having been rated less than this classic, I must have missed it. Despite its shortcomings, the film succeeds in producing a very clean and prize-achieving storyline.

As you may not be aware of, this is the story of a dumb deer, bestowed with the name of Rudolf, and who lives in a fantasy setting. As described, the narrator of the story is the talking snowman that follows Rudolf in his travels as a likeminded misfit, and consequently he gradually, and yet somehow calmly melts to death when nobody is looking. This is not revealed however. Dotting the landscape with white snow, the leitmotif weather of Christmas annoys viewers with a bland background of white snow. Within this setting appears a young deer named Rudolf with what appears to be an irritating pimple on his nose. It is so big that it looks like a cherry tomato. He tries his best to cover it with mud because it is not just an ordinary pimple. It has the magical ability to glow like a nightlight! In addition to this defect, Rudolf and all of the other young reindeer have small horns that stick out of their heads like lumps of black licorice. Now, is that not silly? This important youngling also runs away since he is made fun of and meets up with a complete stranger. This stranger is a toothless runaway elf who wants to be a dentist! And so the portrayal of Rudolf continues as he squeaks about with a high voice and a short outcast of the elf society.

Although scarcely a conflict, the storm that had arisen became so strong that it prohibited Santa from applying navigation techniques, and because he was too dumb to have his elves create a flashlight, he was just about to cancel Christmas. The storm was a blanket. Santa, (who was) previously regarded as not so bright, now fires his toothless dentist wannabe. This brings Rudolf full circle. Meeting up with this ostracized elf, Rudolf seeks a new life so he teams up with the dwarf. Along the way, these two misfits meet an ignominious, oblivious, and selfish man who licks gold for a living and whose name is Cornelius. Cornelius helps them to ward-off the Abominable Snowman. After they had pretended to escape this defenseless giant, the three characters moved on to a greater cause, leaving their past in the tumult of Global Climate Change. The world's toymaker primarily suffers however from the inability to see though a storm and he has to find a solution other than search lights and that becomes the highlight of the movie at this point in the narrative.

Rudolf finally discovers hope. Above the wreck of confusion the two absentminded teenagers, (who were) having trouble fighting, racing, and competing with the storm, finally reappeared at their homes. Santa had been patiently waiting for the two because he wanted to reward them. Surprising even the smartest critic, these two outcasts saved Christmas. The poor old Abominable Snowman that I mentioned earlier is invited to top the Christmas tree with a star. The tree had been erected as a part of the huge celebration for Rudolf, who could light the way through the storm with his nose and prevent Christmas from being cancelled. Unfortunately this version of the film shows the narrator being left outside in the lonely cold and kept out of the marvelous party. If he was upset, the poor snowman did not show it, for he actually chuckled to see the outcasts enjoy themselves before they would be put to hard labor the next day. This ends the silly adventure of the pair of lazy kids. They lived happily ever after.

Rudolf the Red-nosed Reindeer is a rather depressing film because it unfortunately had a sinister motive. Rudolf actually indoctrinates little kids. Unfortunately, Rudolf the reindeer, (who was) previously regarded as being up to no good, is a movie that seems to say O.K. to running away from home but only to return after being chased by a curious monster and a snowstorm. When I am told that this movie is a classic, I laugh because classic means different things to different individuals. Even the dramatic Gone with the Wind is regarded as a classic, but classic does not mean interesting, moral or even instructive as classic probably had been defined in the past. (The phrase, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a @#!$%^&*()_+"" is considered a classic but would not have survived a normal children's cartoon.) Because of the fact that Rudolf escaped any content ratings at all disturbs me. The video jacket describes the film as being harmless and suitable for all audiences but fails to warn consumers of the possible side effects which may include drowsiness, boredom, and addiction to pain killers and even death from brain inactivity. Judging this movie personally, I will agree that it is entertaining for children, but so are the Power-Rangers, Tellie-Tubbies, and Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles. I personally believe that Rudolf the Red-nosed Reindeer is a poor movie that should not be placed on the shelf labeled classics.",1181952000,,5867,4.891457286432161
1631290,4,B00005NB93,"I picked up this DVD at a garage sale thinking it was the 1964 classic until I read the back when I came home to discover it's a sequel.  Regarding the songs, they are horrendous (which is why it loses a point in my rating), but the cartoon, story and all, surprised the heck out of me! All the lovable characters (including Charlie-in-the-box) from the 1964 classic is brought back with a new set of vocal talents that sound so much like the original cast, it's breath-taking and a little eerie. Yes, it's computer-animated instead of the stop-action of the '64 original, but so much attention, care, and love was given to the details, it doesn't become an issue and it gives this installment its own special charm.

Even a new twist on the social issue of Rudolph wishing to be like all the other reindeers was thought-provoking, clever, and wonderfully done. The animators even gave new dimension to Rudolph's nonconformity that does not, in my opinion, ruin the charm of the original. If anything, I look at it as Rudolph's nose changing its nature as he grows older, just as children's traits grow and change and evolve as they go through life.

The writers and animators thought of everything, including Rudolph's continuing relationship with Clarisse, and even giving Hermie the elf a love interest after graduating from Dental School. There are lots of in-jokes galore, including Hermie's vehicle having a modern-day alarm remote that chirps when activated, and there's even a ""borrowing"" from ""Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom.""

The main crux of the story is a dark character called the Toy Taker who has taken toys everywhere including all of the toys in Santa's workshop, and it's up to Rudolph and his friends to solve the mystery, catch the Toy Taker and return the toys in time for Santa's run on Christmas Eve.

Still, I think some of the comments made were a real depiction of the mindset of the time period and it makes me laugh every time I watch it. Everytime Rudolph's Daddy says that, I look at my fiance' and (jokingly) say ""That's right! You heard him! It's MAN's Work!""

A great holiday classic full of laughter, fun and adventure. And the story of Rudolph speaks to one thing in particular. Our differences make us unique but those differences don't have to be a hinderance. They can be a gift. In the hands of a powerful spirit, a weakness can be transformed into a strength.

In addition, the movie includes Rudolph & the other characters from the original movie from 1964, & with the same voices.

The key to enjoying this sequel, & the reason for my 5 star rating, is simple:  I viewed it through the eyes of my 3 year old son, rather than through my now jaded & critical adult eyes.  The only adult criteria was whether the story was good, and was it easy to follow for children, and it definitely is both.

1631323,5,B00005NB93,"The unsurpassed ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" has it all -- innocence and menace, a coming-of age story, a riveting plot, terrific voicing and immortal songs by Johnny Marks.

Released in 1964, ""Rudolph"" captured the issues of the black heart at the center of the bland conformity of the 1950s. In that age, those who were a little bit different did not fit in -- not to mention those who were a lot different! Neither does the film spare depicting less than admirable traits in beloved characters. It is most shocking to see Rudolph being oppressed, not only by his status-minded father Donner but by Santa himself!

""Rudolph"" continues to mesmerize because of its adorable cast of characters - including Herbie the Dentist, lovable Clarise, Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable, the Charley-in-the-box and a host of others. But its world-weary air, thanks to Burl Ives's voicing of Sam the Snowman, removes it from the realm of saccharin holiday tales. It would take a cold heart indeed to watch the story of the misfit toys and remain unmoved.

""Rudolph"" is a tale of social conformity, rejection, single-minded determination and eventual redemption and social reintegration. It is these large themes -- not the cuteness of the animals or colorful sets--that make the story a perennial favorite. But the animation almost steals the show. Every tiny bird and squirrel is lovingly crafted and animated. And Johnny Marks' tunes - ""Silver and Gold,"" ""There's Always Tomorrow"" ""I Am Not Just a Misfit"" and ""We are Santa's Elves"" among them - each add their own luster to the gleaming, heart-shaped Christmas ornament that is ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer."" If you don't find yourself singing these adorable songs at odd times during the year, it's time for a rewatching!

1631327,5,B00005NB93,"Absolutely, without a doubt, my all-time nostalgic favorite Christmas movie from childhood!  And I imagine this is true for many, many others as well.

I think perhaps my favorite memories of Christmases of childhood revolve around waiting anxiously for Rudolph to air on TV.  Anyone here remember the days long ago when you got ONE chance to watch it each year, and that was IT?

As much as I adore our modern age of DVDs and the ability to watch a well-loved film over and over, this is one instance where I find it kind of sad.  I recall excitedly purchasing this DVD for my kids, only to find that the fact they could watch it over and over made it a rather mundane experience (I have since made a strict policy in my home that each of our Christmas movie favorites are to be treasured ONCE each season, just as in my own childhood.  Strict?  Maybe.  Worth it? You bet!).

Romeo Muller, known for his many heart-warming, classic children's animated Christmas films, hit the proverbial home run with Rudolph.  The varied and colorful well-loved characters alltogether formed the finest collection of Christmas personas of all time.  Sam the Snowman (voiced magically by Burl Ives -- who can ever forget ""Have a Holly Jolly Christmas""?), Rudolph (""She thinks I'm cuuuute!""), Hermy the elf that wanted to be a dentist (""I'll never fit in!""), Santa and Mrs. Claus (""Eat, Santa, eat! Whoever heard of a skinny Santa?""), Yukon Cornelius (""Mush! Muuuush!""), The Abominable (terrifying when I was a child, delightfully goofy now that I'm a supposed grown-up), and of course all of the mis-fit toys (""Whoever heard of a CHARLIE in the box?!"").

How about instead of continuing my heartfelt ramblings about my favorite Christmas treat of young childhood, I urge any of you who have not seen Rudolph (i.e., those who have lived on another planet) to get a copy pronto and enjoy it (or better yet, share it with your children).

For those of you who have seen it, but haven't in a long time -- please, indulge yourself!  Get a copy (or at least rent it), pop some popcorn and make some hot cocoa, and soak up the warm memories.  You won't regret it.

Oh, and Have a Holly Jolly Christmas!! : )",1165708800,,2185,4.636363636363637

1631338,5,B00005NB93,"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer is indeed the most marvelous Christmas film ever! It is one of many superb animated films written by a great man named Romeo Muller. Rudolph is doubtless his best-loved work. I remember watching the film as a child, delighted and enraptured by the story that it told. Do you remember? Sam the Snowman as narrator (voiced and sung in the performance of a lifetime by Burl Ives); Rudolph the misfit and rejected reindeer; Rudolph's friend, Hermy the Elf, also a misfit because he doesn't like to make toys but wants to be a dentist; Yukon Cornelius, the prospector who befriends them both; the Abominable Snowmonster of the North (whom Yukon, in prospector slang, invariably calls a ""bumble""); the Island of Misfit Toys, and its winged lion ruler, King Moonracer; and many other characters and story threads. The presentation, interweaving, and resolution of all of these elements is positively Shakespearean in deftness, wit, poetic beauty and brevity of expression, depth, pathos, joy, moral instruction, and the sense that all ends as indeed it should. Grounded in a deep and sparkling love of all creation, these qualities characterize all of Romeo Muller's films.

Special effects such as the ocean and snow flying up into the air made me feel more like I was watching animation from a Nintendo 64.  The video quality gets 2 stars.

For the cast of some bigger celebrities of their time, Jamie Lee Curtis, Richard Dreyfus and Rick Moranis, the movie was worth a look.

Music and sound quality is good.  Many of the songs were very good.  The storyline is decent and kept my daughter entertained.  The mystery of the villain at the end of the movie was a big disappointment.  Additionally, rather than bringing spirit and cheer, this movie is another spin off from the Grinch by Dr. Seuss.

For the entertainment of a child less than 6, the movie is at best acceptable.  For anyone else, don't bother.",1137542400,,876,4.551282051282051

1631341,5,B00005NB93,"In just telling the story in the song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" would make for a decent enough animated holiday television show. But where the 1964 production from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. achieved greatness was in the creativeness it showed with the supporting cast. The story is narrated by Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives (who sang the second most popular version of the song after Gene Autry's orignal), and Rudolph (Billie Mae Richards) becomes friends with both Hermey (Paul Soles), the elf who marches to his own drummer, and Yukon Cornelius (Larry D. Mann), the prospector. However, the most unforgettable characters in this story are the toys from the Island of Misfit Toys: Charlie-in-the-Box, the Spotted Elephant, and the others, along with their leader, King Moonracer.

The result is a much deeper version of the story than was even hinted at in the lyrics of Johnny Marks' classic Christmas song. We all now how the story is going to end on that foggy Christmas eve, so it is everything leading up to that fateful night that is where this story gets its deserved reputation as Rudolph is not the only one who ends up having their life take a turn for the better, as even the Abominable Snowman finds he can put the finishing touches on a perfect Christmas. Besides, how often does a dentist get to be the hero in a Christmas story?

Bass-Rankin took at similar approach in 1970 with ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,"" and while that animated holiday show is pretty good and worth watching each Christmas season, this one is better. If you have been in a store and seen the looks of pure delight on people's faces when they see the line of toy figures associated with ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" then you already know this. Hard to believe this particular ""Rudolph"" will enjoy its fortieth anniversary next year.",1135468800,,1850,4.778125

Wow...was I mistaken. The story is mean-spirited, moreso than I would have dreamed. I realize that the same could be said about parts of the original, but it 'feels' different.

Beyond that, the animation is atrocious. In an age when 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was about to hit the theaters, I would expect a team of computer animators to absolutely nail the 1960's look at worst, and at best show me a much more elaborate view of Rudolph's world.

Nope...

no such luck.

It is quite honestly some of the worst 3d animation I've ever seen.  There are mistakes in it that a novice with some low-end software and a 'Dummies' book wouldn't even make.  Amazing.

Anyway, stick with the original. Let something as wonderful as that stand alone, no need for revamping, rehashing, or retelling.  Some things are best left as is.",1134864000,,1021,4.53551912568306

Of course, when the Toy Taker makes off with Santa's toys, it's up to the red nosed caribou to save the day.  The songs as usual are pretty forgettable and the main voice actors are merely adequate.

1631358,4,B00005NB93,"Back in the days of VHS, one of the cheapest things you could buy was a low-quality cartoon compilation of obscure shorts and public domain classics. Some were watchable and some were not, some gave you a ton of cartoons while others presented only a few, and the Christmas compilations were often the most fascinating. Now, we have DVD, and the same such compilations can be found. Being a huge fan of both Christmas AND cartoons, I finally picked up my first such disc a year or so ago, and this is it: ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Friends,"" from Front Row Features.

""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Friends,"" released on DVD in 2001 by Front Row Features, includes the following cartoon shorts:

1. ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" - This is the 1948 Fleischer Studios classic you may have seen on television during the Disney Channel's better, earlier days; a magical interpretation of the song's story with that magical Fleischer Studios look. (color)
2. ""Santa's Surprise"" - From Famous Studios in 1947, this was the first ever Little Audrey cartoon. It's a very cute and charming little short about children of the world gathering together to give Santa Claus a Christmas gift for a change. (color)
3. ""Ginger Nutt's Christmas Circus"" - This 1949 short is one of the classic ""Animaland"" cartoons by former Disney animator David Hand! In this story, Ginger Nutt the squirrel puts on a Christmas-time Circus, and a heckling parrot sneaks his way in at a weasel's expense. (color)
4. ""Christmas Comes But Once a Year"" - From 1936, this Fleischer cartoon features that ol' Betty Boop character, Grampy, as he uses his inventiveness to cheer up the inhabitants of a rundown orphanage on Christmas morning. This is another old fave from Disney Channel airings years ago! (color)
5. ""Shanty Where Santy Claus Lives"" - This Warner Brothers Merrie Melodies cartoon from 1933 is the musical story of a poor little boy who gets to take a ride with Santa to his toy shop full of lively toys. (black and white)
6. ""Hector's Hectic Life"" - Missing the title card and mislabeled on the DVD case as ""Christmas Pups,"" this 1948 Famous Studios short is a sweet story of a messy dog who has to keep things neat on Christmas Eve to avoid being thrown out in the cold. When three puppies show up on his door, his job becomes more than a little difficult. (color)
7. ""Snow Foolin'"" - This 1949 Famous Studios short is a ""funny animals"" type film, and the majority of it is a bouncing ball sing-a-long of ""Jingle All the Way."" Cute and enjoyable, especially for nostalgic reasons. (color)
8. ""Little Tin Soldier"" - This cartoon, taken from the UK's ""Mr. Piper"" TV show of the 1960s, opens and closes with the live-action Mr. Piper (a Canadian opera singer named Alan Crofoot) and is a limited animation version of ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier."" Nice little cartoon. (color)
9. Tweety in ""Gift Wrapped"" - In this enjoyable 1952 Tweety classic, Sylvester is overjoyed when Santa leaves Granny a tweety bird as a present, but Granny and an interfering bulldog won't allow him to enjoy the gift. Sadly, this cartoon is among the lowest in picture quality on the disc. (color)
10. ""The Christmas Visitor"" - A 1959 British cartoon from Halas and Batchelor, this film presents itself as a rendition of ""The Night Before Christmas,"" but takes a break from the classic poem to tell a story of a toy sailor, a musical statuette shepherd girl, and a jealous villain as Santa enjoys cookies and a cigar. (red and white?)
11. ""Star of Bethlehem""- From Cathedral Films in 1959, this is a lovely presentation of animated silhouettes on colorful backgrounds telling the narrated story of the birth of Christ and the shepherds and wise men who came to worship him. (color silhouette)

The eleven shorts that make up the disc's programming are, as I said, not presented in very good quality, but they are watchable for the most part and some are much better than that. Also, the classic Fleischer ""Rudolph"" is complete, while I've read that other discs cut off the beginning and end. You also get ""Christmas Comes but Once a Year,"" another Fleischer classic that gained fame through Disney Channel airings in the `80s. Some of the other `toons are from Famous Studios, such as ""Santa's Surprise,"" starring Little Audrey. However, be forewarned that some of the shorts, such as that Little Audrey one, contain racial stereotyping of the time. There's some great animation here, obviously (considering the studios I've mentioned so far). The ""Star of Bethlehem"" is enchanting, and you even get one of David Hand's Animaland shorts. Of course, this is not the source to go to if you are seeking definitive copies of these cartoons. This is simply a good disc to pop in while wrapping gifts or winding down after a night of holiday shopping. The runtime of the disc is stated as 90 minutes on the snap-case, which is an attractive one compared to some I have seen lately. I'm giving this disc 4 stars because some of the cartoons are outstanding, even if the quality presented isn't the best. I've seen much worse, and these range from watchable to more than watchable and are all enjoyable shorts. Recommended mainly for Christmas and animation fanatics.",1133222400,,5226,4.798002219755827
1631359,4,B00005NB93,"Every year as a child I looked forward to watching Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer during the holidays. In fact, I looked forward to seeing it on TV even as an adult!

Wanting to share this great classic with my 7 year old son, I bought it for him a few weeks ago. Sure, I had it recorded on a VHS along with other Christmas classics, but the quality wasn't that great and we had to endure commercials.

The DVD version seems to be cleaned up from the TV version in terms of quality. I seem to recall more background ""fuzzies"" when it was on TV (perhaps the DVD was re-mastered?)

The Desinty's Child claymation video is basically worthless, in my opinion, unless you have a little fan of this kind of music (and I don't).

With a run-time of 65 minutes, this DVD has hardly any extras. There's a lost scene which originally aired in place of the song ""Why Am I Such A Misfit?"" (an optimistic tune about striking out and finding your fortune). You can also view the DVD in Spanish, and my son gets a kick out of doing that once in awhile.

The ""previews"" for other DVD's--including an annoying promo for one about Peter Rabbit/Easter--seems ENDLESS. It's a shame how they advertise to death on DVD's for youngsters!

And as far as the Rudolph story: well, I was always bothered that Rudolph's Dad rejected him for being different--as well as Santa himself! Very disappointing, but isn't that like life--where people judge based on appearances?

1631364,5,B00005NB93,"This animated movie charms us and can still be counted on to bring smiles to our faces.

I believe that Rudolph was created by Robert L. May ... originally for a coloring book (for the kids) ... that accompanied the Montgomery Ward Christmas catalog of that year (1939).  The song ""Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer"" was later (1949) written by Robert L. May's brother-in-law ... Johnny Marks ... and recorded (reluctantly) by Gene Autry.

The first animated film ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" was a Max Fleischer cartoon of about 1951.  In that one, Rudolph lives in a reindeer village far from the North Pole, and is discovered sleeping by Santa ... who wakes Rudolph and asks him to help.  Rudolph saves the day, and is later honored in a stadium (in his home town) and named ""Commander in Chief"".

This version (the Johnny Marks one here) is about a hundred times better.  I love the puppets here ... though they must have required a lot of work (and about a million photos) ... but it is the story that, I believe, captures our hearts.

The credit for that (the story) goes to Mr. May, but also to a guy named Romeo Muller ... who filled out and embellished the original tale for this, the 1964 made-for-television movie.

Having Rudolph be a heartbroken misfit ... who prevails ... is an excellent lesson for many of us who were (and are) in the same predicament as kids... and adding in Hermey and Clarice and Yukon Cornelius (and even the snow monster) ... just makes it a wonderful and meaningful story.

And the songs are very excellent.  Johnny Marks did high quality work here (as the song writer) ... as many of them are still being heard (at Christmas time) today ... some 40 years later.

This is just a great movie for everybody ... children and children at heart ... to watch.",1126224000,,1793,4.5514018691588785

1631366,5,B00005NB93,"One of a plethora of animated Christmas classics created in the 1960's - A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) and How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966) come to mind - this rendition of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is unique in that it uses stop-motion animation instead of cartoons to tell its story. Sam the Snowman (voiced by Burl Ives) brilliantly narrates the tale of an awkward reindeer and his struggle with discrimination. Along the way, he sings a number of holiday classics such as ""Silver and Gold,"" ""Holly Jolly Christmas,"" and of course - ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"".

The story begins when Rudolph's father, Donner, tries to cover up his son's shiny, bright red nose with a disguise. When Rudolph attends a flight training school for young reindeer, he encounters Clarice - a young doe who thinks that Rudolph is cute. This revelation causes Rudolph to leap into the air and fly around the sky like a seasoned aviator. But when he lands, the nose disguise falls off and Rudolph's red honker is exposed to the scorn and ridicule of the young bucks in flight school. Clarice is the only one who doesn't view Rudolph as an outcast freak, but her father quickly escorts her out of the presence of such a ""monster"".

Following this episode, Rudolph runs away only to meet up with an outcast Elf named Hermey who has committed the unforgivable sin of not wanting to make toys. Contrary to the social conventions of his time, Hermey wants to be a dentist. Feeling unwanted, Rudolph and Hermey decide to run away together. But in due time, they encounter the dangerous Abominable Snow Monster - a giant, hairy beast who crushes anyone who leaves Christmastown. Aiding in their rescue is Yukon Cornelius, a burly prospector who chops off a piece of ice with his pick ax, allowing Rudolph, Hermey, and himself to float away from the Abominable Snow Monster (who can't swim).

After floating through the night, the three characters discover The Land of Misfit Toys - an island of handicapped, screwed-up toys rejected by elf quality-control managers and forced to live away their best years in an icy wasteland. Our three heroes can relate to the misfit toys, and Rudolph promises to inform Santa of their status the next time he sees him.

When Rudolph sneaks away in the middle to return home, he meets up with Clarice (who ran away from home to search for him), and the two of them get cornered by the Abominable Snow Monster. But Yukon Cornelius faces down the Monster, and together with Hermey, he coaxes the beast into a trap - where Hermey neutralizes the Monster by pulling out his teeth.

Meanwhile, Christmastown is covered with a thick fog, and Santa ponders the cancellation of Christmas. But when he sees Rudolph's bright red nose glowing in his workshop, Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh through the night. With Rudolph taking the lead, Santa swoops down on Christmas Eve just in time to rescue the depressed residents of The Land of Misfit Toys and deliver them all to expectant boys and girls who will love them for who they are.

This breakthrough Claymation classic is essential for any child's Christmas experience (and that of adults who grew up watching much-anticipated annual holiday special on TV). That's why this ranks as a definite ""must-see"" by any standard. But undoubtedly, we all owe a special thanks to Montgomery Ward - the giant retail chain that created Rudolph as part of a promotional gimmick one fabled Christmas season decades ago. For after all, it just wouldn't be Christmas without Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer...

1631377,4,B00005NB93,"This is a great holiday special. I especially like the Island of Misfit Toys detail. The only reason I gave the special 4 stars rather than 5 stars is the detail in which Hermey pulls out the Bumble's teeth to make him safe(this could not be done to real-life animals that bite, for they cannot live without their teeth.  I think this is improperly teaching the viewer that an animal who bites can have its teeth pulled to make it less harmful to humans.  Therefore, I believe that this segment can easily send the wrong message to children.) Nevertheless, the special shows how okay it is to be different. Sometimes I cry when I watch the Island of Misfit Toys segment, but light up again with a smile when I see the misfit toys being dropped out of the sleigh at the end. If you have the older VHS, be sure to upgrade to this DVD version with the original song, ""We're A Couple of Misfits."" The ""Fame and Fortune"" song is included as a bonus feature.",1104192000,,952,4.372881355932203
1631378,2,B00005NB93,"I cannot believe that some level of management actually approved to spend money to produce this major but unnecessary project.  Clearly a lot of effort went into making it but it is an overwrought and underwhelming gilding of the lily.  The old one was fine, simple and charming.  This one is complicated and frankly a bit stressful.  This was more a platform for computer animation stunts than a childrens' Christmas flick.

I just ordered the original for my under 7 year old four kids for next year.  This new version just went in the bin.  Fortunately it was a great buy.  But . . . you get what you pay for.",1104105600,,612,4.45045045045045
1631379,5,B00005NB93,"First televised on NBC-TV on Sunday, December 6, 1964 (but usually associated with CBS-TV due to that network's many airings of the program throughout the succeeding years), the animated color TV Special ""Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" has now turned forty years of age (as of this writing), and has endured for all those years as an annual staple in many American homes.

The DVD edition I'm reviewing here is the one issued by ""Sony Wonder"" and ""Golden Books Family Entertainment"" (1-Disc version). It provides a very good-looking Full Frame (1.33:1) video image of the perennial ""Rudolph"" Christmas Special; with a Dolby Digital soundtrack recorded in 2-channel (original) Mono.

This particular version of ""Rudolph"" is quite unique actually, in that it is the ""unaltered"" version of the TV Special, as it aired originally in 1964. Which means that one song which has been routinely cut out of subsequent broadcasts of the program is presented uncut within this DVD version. That song being ""We're A Couple Of Misfits"", sung by Rudolph and dentist-to-be ""Hermey"" near the beginning of the show. This song was replaced in 1965 with the ""Fame And Fortune"" song instead.

The alternate song used in that scene (""Fame And Fortune"") is included, however, as a separate Bonus Feature on this DVD. .... To tell you the truth, I prefer the ""Fame & Fortune"" number to the original ""Misfits"" tune. And I can see why the producers of the Special decided to make the switch during the second broadcast of the program in 1965. ""F&F"" is a better ditty, IMO. And, obviously, others thought so as well. Hence, the substitution.

This DVD contains the complete, uncut version of ""Rudolph"" (with a total run time of 51 minutes, 32 seconds). This is significant (and most welcome), because after the first few broadcasts on network TV, as we all know, many cuts and edits were made to the original print, so that more and more commercials could be jammed into the one-hour network timeslot over the years. It's doubtful we'll ever encounter this original ""51-minute"" version on network television again, due to the ever-increasing sponsors' demands for prime-time air time.

All of the rarely-seen snippets of the ""Rudolph"" Special are re-inserted into this full-length DVD version -- clips like: the ""Peppermint"" scene at the tail-end of the special, where Yukon Cornelius discovers ""a peppermint mine! Yahooo!"" .... And: the complete musical numbers (""Jingle, Jingle, Jingle!"" and ""We Are Santa's Elves"") are fully intact on the DVD; whereas, in many chopped-up prints, one (or both) of these songs have either been severely truncated or cut out entirely. It's nice to be able to see the ""whole"" show via this nicely-done ""Sony"" DVD release.

This disc has a few nice add-on bonus supplements, too. In addition to the aforementioned bonus song (""Fame And Fortune""), there's also a Rudolph trivia game, an original TV promo, some ads for other ""Golden Books"" holiday DVD titles, and a fun and informative 11-minute ""introduction"" by producer/creator Arthur Rankin.

In addition, you can access English Subtitles in two different ways on this disc -- there are the traditional ""captions""/(subtitles) that can be turned on at the bottom of the screen. Plus, this DVD offers what is called ""Read-Speak Action Captions"", which show the words on the screen in a unique, 3-D kind of fashion, displaying the words in large print right beside the mouths of each character speaking, one word at a time. An interesting alternative to the normal captioning process.

Chapter breaks are also included on this disc, with a whopping total of 27 ""Scene Selections""! My goodness, some three-hour movie DVDs don't have this many Chapter Stops! :) *

* = NOTE: The ""Read-Speak"" Captioned version of ""Rudolph"" (which can be accessed via the Bonus Features area) does not have any ""Chapter"" breaks included.

An added word or two about the ""TV Promo"" on this disc --- This is a nice little bonus, which runs for 59 seconds and exhibits very good color and overall picture quality. It's an original 1966 NBC-TV promo that informs the viewers that ""Rudolph is coming on Sunday, December 4th, on the General Electric Fantasy Hour"" program.

A word about the DVD Menus ..... I'm not a big fan of ""Animated Menus"" on DVDs, but this disc's Menu system is an exception. For some reason, I really like these Menus, which offer up cheery music and cute animated sequences. The Main Menu puts the viewer right into the Christmas spirit, featuring falling snow, a decorated Christmas tree, and ""Rudolph"" looking skyward, complete with batting eyelids and a bright glowing nose. While the various Sub-Menus also have animated moving pictures and a ""falling snow"" background as well. Each Sub-Menu features a different character from the ""Rudolph"" Special.

Some additional ""Rudolph"" Notes and Trivia and Miscellaneous Ramblings :-) ..................

>> The voice talent for ""Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" was supplied by Burl Ives (Narrator/""Sam""), Billie Mae Richards (""Rudolph""), Paul Soles (""Hermey""), Larry Mann (""Yukon""), and Alfie Scopp (""Head Elf"").

>> I hadn't realized this trivial tidbit until recently ...... Comet (the reindeer coach) was voiced by Don Adams (of ""Get Smart"" TV fame).

>> I've often wondered how many little kids who have watched this ""Rudolph"" Special were suddenly scared to death that Christmas might be ""cancelled"" (as feared in the show due to foul weather). LOL!

>> Has anyone (besides me) ever noticed with amusement that the gruff voice of the ""Head Elf"" dramatically changes, somehow, just before he begins to direct his ""Elf Chorus"" in the song ""We Are Santa's Elves""? Throughout the majority of the show, Mr. Head Elf is the very coarse-sounding 'meanie' -- when he dishes out some of my favorite lines from the show, such as: ""Now you come to Elf Practice and learn how to wiggle your ears, and chuckle warmly, and go ""hehe"" and ""hoho"", and important stuff like that! A dentist! Good grief!"" .... And yet, in the ""chorus"" scene, his voice changes completely. He sounds a bit wimpish when he utters: ""Now let's try out the new elf song I wrote; and remember, it's for Santa."" (LOL!) This sudden and drastic vocal-cord switch always cracks me up when I watch this program.

The ""Rudolph"" TV Special is truly an American tradition. A must-see each December. And now, via this nice uncut DVD edition, the adventures of our antlered hero with the crimson-colored snoot should remain crystal-clear and in pristine condition forever.",1104019200,,6561,5.070500927643785

1631382,4,B00005NB93,"This is an all-time classic and the best part about the DVD release is that, unlike the VHS version, there's songs and brief little moments that you never see on TV anymore that were in the original 1964 broadcast. As for special features, there's the ""Fame and Fortune"" song, which replaced the ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" reprise that was in the original broadcast in 1965. It was a nice touch restoring the original print to the original broadcast, not the chopped-up versions that followed in years since. Since I was born in 1982, much of this stuff was a new experience for me, as I had only seen the CBS syndicated version, and the chopped-up VHS versions.

Kudos to the DVD publisher for including the ENTIRE movie this time around! :-)

Pluses: ""We Are Santa's Elves"" and ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" included, as well as other bits and pieces that were cut out of the original print to make more commercial time. ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" replaces the inferior ""Fame and Fortune"" song that had replaced ""Misfits"" almost 40 years ago. Original broadcast version, in its entirety. ""Fame and Fortune"" included as a bonus feature, and there's an interesting bit with Arthur Rankin, one half of the Rankin & Bass team (think Pixar, but in the 60s and with puppets instead of computers). Also included is a spanish language track, AND an original 60s television promo for the film. Colorful menus and trivia game. Oh yeah, and great movie.

Minuses: The color and picture could be more polished, the sound is about a B+. Not much in the way of bonus features or featurettes. Doesn't include any other Rankin & Bass holiday favorites like other Rankin & Bass DVD sets do. DOES come with a Destiny's Child single of the group singing ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" -- you might want to pass on that part.

1631383,5,B00005NB93,"""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" sends a Christmas message of acceptance, individuality, and the value of friendship. At least, it does after the last five minutes, when Rudolph saves everyone's butts from...er...fog.

The story begins when Rudolph is born. To his parents' horror, he has a flashing red nose. When Santa, the cruel despot of Christmastown (seriously -- in this show, he's a jerk), makes no attempt to hide his disgust, Rudolph's father, Donner, displays some dubious parenting techniques by forcing the young deer to disguise his luminous snout. Unfortunately, Rudolph's shameful deformity is discovered by the other young reindeer, who laugh and call him names. One of these cretins is named Fireball - he's got a single wisp of blond hair and freckles, so he really shouldn't be one to talk.

When Rudolph is cast out from Christmastown, he meets some new friends:

Hermey - a toy-hating elf with an oral fixation, and a finger-wave hairdo that would make Conan O'Brien jealous. Hermey loses his job because he wants to live an alternate lifestyle. How PC.

Yukon Cornelius - a burly prospector seeking to increase his personal wealth. Interestingly, he carries a gun. Yukon helps Rudolph defeat a giant snow-monster. The monster (who is white) represents The Man, crushing anyone who does not bow to conformity (by staying safely in Christmastown).

Misfit Toys - a bunch of toys that nobody wants: a boat that doesn't float, a train with square wheels, a squirt-gun filled with jelly, etc. Frankly, I think Santa's workshop needs better Quality Control, if they're turning out junk like this. Besides, I can think of a few seventh graders who could make the most of a jelly-gun.

Clarice - a doe-eyed...well...doe, with Revlon lashes and a bow in her hair. She's lovely and tolerant, and the most under-developed character in the story.

While this enchanting tale is a family-favorite it fails as an origin story, neglecting to explain why Rudolph's nose glows. It's obviously a genetic mutation, but we never learn the mechanism behind it. Does it give off heat? Why does it make that feeble whistling sound? Is it any more horrifying than the fact that Santa can go from skinny to fat in the course of one day?

It's also disconcerting that, by story's end, Rudolph has reached maturity (with tall, pointed antlers), but his voice has not changed. Perhaps reindeer puberty is unpredictable, but Rudolph is the only adult male who doesn't sound like J. Jonah Jameson.

Still, I recommend this Claymation Classic for anyone. Despite the flaws, it just wouldn't be Christmas without ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!""",1101168000,,2637,5.057603686635945

1631386,5,B00005NB93,"I always loved the anti-authoritarian messages of the 60's-era Rankin Bass films. ""Rudolph"" is probably my favorite.  Its sense of history, and sly use of metaphor, are unrivaled among holiday specials. Santa is a case in point: the brash young rebel of ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" has aged, like so many real-life revolutionaries, into a complacent, jackbooted despot. He has mislaid the flame of revolution, which is now in the hands (or rather the nose) of young Rudolph.

To some degree, the tale is predictable, with a familiar set-up. A rebel-hero requires that the status quo (or ruling party) be, if not evil, then extremely jaded and misguided. Santa, the tyrant of Christmas Town, who has Castro's beard and pomposity, has built an austere, Walachia-like kingdom on the sweatshop labor of elves in the unregulated North. He seems the ideal villain-a capitalist straw man from a Socialist tract-and you eagerly await his downfall.

Of course, Jolly Saint Nick can never be deposed. As a young man, he once swept the Burghermeister into the flames like so much tinsel, but in the centuries since he has become the face of a nation and seems destined to fade, like Castro, into white hairs and senility. Thus, the tension-how will they resolve it?

Rudolph, shunned in his homeland, reaches maturity (like the prophets of old) on the howling wastes, where he regards the hollowness of Santa's regime.  Like Simon in ""Lord of the Flies,"" he realizes that the Abominable (the State bogeyman) is, in reality, just some harmless bugaboo, the product and victim of government hype. In a stirring climax, Rudolph the Red, assisted by an inner circle of misfits and weirdoes (including the defanged Abominable), returns to Christmas Town to confront Santa. He knows that the old regime, beset by storms and malaise, is doomed. What follows demonstrates his tactical genius: the venerable Santa will become the Revolution's impotent figurehead; Rudolph, its scorching beacon. The old king, recalling the glory of his own Putsch, hands the reins of power to the young firebrand, who quickly liberates the deformed misfit inmates of a floating Bastille (imprisoned ""for their own good"" by an imperious, leonine, eagle-winged warden) and unleashes them on society.

While I had hoped The Year w/out a Santa Clause was among them so I could see the boys again [Heat Miser and Snow Miser] this collection supplements its cousin nicely.  Both in our mid-30's there is something comforting about watching Rudolph and remembering your childhood and past Christmases where the family would gather on the day this was being broadcast and enjoy Burl Ives plowing about as the nattily dressed snowman narrator.  Approached w/ an adult sensibility, one really sees how disparaging if not outright cruel the mocking was on Rudolph and to a lesser extend Hermey.  The misfit toys solicit `aww's as usual and we actually found ourselves rooting for the ultimate misfit, that poor prisoner of his station, the bumbling abominable snowman.  That toothy visage was actually scary once upon a time.  Rudolph's personal journey and eventual transformation to hero is handled deftly and will appeal to people across the age range.  The songs and feeling of nostalgia definitely make for a feel-good holiday viewing.",1072051200,,1146,5.0
1631390,5,B00005NB93,"Do you recall the most famous Raindeer of all? In 1964 Author Rankin Jr., and Jules Bass created a ""Claymation"" production that involved, puppets, magic, music and great storytelling.
Based on the classic Johnny Marks (Ballad of Yogi Bear) song the story tells the tale of the young Reindeer who grew up a little different from everyone else. And in the process makes some great new friends who are all different and have their own special abilities.
Together they learn, friendship, teamwork and love and the real importnace of Christmas and the Christmas spirit. Amazingly charming and fun for the adults and the kids will laugh and cry and feel good about themselves knowing that being diffrent is often better then being like everyone else.
Burl Ives (The Ewok Adventure, Roots, Day in An Outlaw) does the incredible narration and even sings the second signature song in this classic ""Silver and GOld"". A wonderful ballad. Billie Mae Richards (Care Bears, Spiderman) is the voice of Rudolf herself. Stan Francis (Spiderman) is the voice of Santa and Larry D. Mann (Columbo, Oliver Twist)is the voice of Yukon Cornelious.
The DVD Extra's include behind the scenes storyboards, pencil tests and pictures of the original creators. There is also a deleted song that was not included in the original broadcast but added later in some versions. Rudolph trivia game.
This is a great DVD for the whole family and fun to watch EVERY Holiday season. You can't help humming the song even after the show is over. (12-11-03)",1071100800,,1515,4.9450980392156865
1631391,5,B00005NB93,"I can remember the days when I was a child and looked forward to watching the musical fantasy ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" on television, with its adorable, stop-motion, puppet-like characters and the enchanting songs sung by Burl Ives.  Written by Robert L. May and directed by Kizo Nagashima and Larry Roemer, ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" is just as engaging and entertaining for children today as it was when it was first released in 1964.  The story is about a young reindeer named Rudolph (voice by Billie Mae Richards) who is teased and jaunted by other reindeer because he has a glowing red nose instead of a little black nose like every other reindeer.  Seeing himself as a misfit, he decides to run away and is joined by an elf named Hermey (voice by Paul Soles).  Hermey also considers himself a misfit because he wants to be dentist instead of a toy-maker like the other elves.  They meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (voice by Larry D. Mann), unwanted toys on the Island of Misfit Toys, it's lion king named King Moonracer (voice by Stan Francis) and the scary abominable snowman.  Other characters include the young reindeer Clarice (voice by Janet Orenstein), her father (voice by Paul Kligman), Comet the coach (voice by Paul Kligman), Santa Claus (voice by Stan Francis), the Head Elf (voice by Alfie Scopp), Charlie-in-the-Box (voice by Carl Banas) and a spotted elephant (voice by Carl Banas).  The story is also narrated by Sam the Snowman, whose voice was done by Burl Ives (1909-1995).
Songs in this adorable children's fantasy include:
* ""A Holly Jolly Christmas"" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)
* ""Jingle Jingle Jingle"" (5 stars, performed by Santa Claus).
* ""We Are Santa's Elves"" (5 stars, performed by Santa's elves.)
* ""There's Always Tomorrow"" (5+ stars, performed by Clarice.)
* ""We're A Couple of Misfits"" (5 stars, performed by Rudolph and Hermey.)
* ""Fame and Fortune"" (4.5 stars, performed by Rudolf and Hermey.)
* ""Silver and Gold"" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)
* ""The Most Wonderful Day of the Year"" (4.5 stars, performed by the misfit toys.)
* ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)
Overall, I rate ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" with 5 out of 5 stars.  It's a wonderful musical fantasy that is sure to please and excite any child that watches it.",1071014400,,2390,4.898514851485149
1631392,5,B00005NB93,"This is one amazing show that everybody loves. The unforgettable characters and memorable music make ""Rudolph"" one of the videos my family never fails to watch each winter. See, I'm 16 years old and didn't grow up with all these stop-motion, ""Animagic"" Rankin/Bass holiday special shows, but I do love them. For the longest time I watched ""Rudolph"" every Christmas and ""Peter Cottontail"" every Easter, but didn't know the wealth of other wonderfully great shows awaiting me. Luckily just today I finished watching the Rankin/Bass marathon on TV, and was introduced to some other incredible classics that I must buy: ""Pinnochio's Christmas,"" ""Jack Frost,"" ""The First Christmas,"" ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" ""Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey,"" ""The Year without a Santa Claus"" (the best one), ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year,"" and more. I know most of the voice acting because I enjoy watching older TV sitcoms and game shows, in which all these 70's actors and actresses starred. ""Rudolph"" will always remain a favorite part of my holiday traditions. The characters of Yukon Cornelius, the Bumble, Clarice (Rudolph's girlfriend), and Hermey, along with the songs like ""Silver and Gold"" and ""Santa's Elves""--oh, and let's forget the BEST part of all, those poor little Misfit Toys!--make this one video you can't afford to miss.",1070668800,,1324,5.25

1631394,5,B00005NB93,"In just telling the story in the song ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" would make for a decent enough animated holiday television show.  But where the 1964 production from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. achieved greatness was in the creativeness it showed with the supporting cast.  The story is narrated by Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives (who sang the second most popular version of the song after Gene Autry's orignal), and Rudolph (Billie Mae Richards) becomes friends with both Hermey (Paul Soles), the elf who marches to his own drummer, and Yukon Cornelius (Larry D. Mann), the prospector.  However, the most unforgettable characters in this story are the toys from the Island of Misfit Toys: Charlie-in-the-Box, the Spotted Elephant, and the others, along with their leader, King Moonracer.
The result is a much deeper version of the story than was even hinted at in the lyrics of Johnny Marks' classic Christmas song.  We all now how the story is going to end on that foggy Christmas eve, so it is everything leading up to that fateful night that is where this story gets its deserved reputation as Rudolph is not the only one who ends up having their life take a turn for the better, as even the Abominable Snowman finds he can put the finishing touches on a perfect Christmas.  Besides, how often does a dentist get to be the hero in a Christmas story?
Bass-Rankin took at similar approach in 1970 with ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,"" and while that animated holiday show is pretty good and worth watching each Christmas season, this one is better.  If you have been in a store and seen the looks of pure delight on people's faces when they see the line of toy figures associated with ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" then you already know this.  Hard to believe this particular ""Rudolph"" will enjoy its fortieth anniversary next year.",1070323200,,1855,4.778125
1631395,5,B00005NB93,The first Rudolph animated movie is pale in comparison to this one. OK it may be sugary sweet but your kids (under 9) will love it. Why people pour scorn on this version is beyond me. Maybe they should have left it to their kids to review it!,1070236800,,242,4.0625
1631396,1,B00005NB93,"While I must admit at the outset that my children like this movie, I am somewhat appalled by it.  And I don't think it's necessary to compare it to the Rudolph I grew up with in order to rank it poorly--nostalgia tends to color our opinions.
What is obvious immediately is that this is, oddly enough, a vehicle for celebrities to lament their fame.  Rudolph, once hating his unique glowing nose because it made him a misfit, gained acceptance because he saved Christmas with that oddity (really, a questionable moral for the first flick--you're only accepted if you can prove yourself worthy--compare with Thomas the Tank Engine's highest sought-after praise being that he's useful).  Now Rudolph is famous and can't go anywhere without be asked to shine his attribute.  It's all the other residents of the north pole care about.  Poor Rudolph, if only he was just plain normal.  (Hermie, at least, has discovered his bliss as a dentist--a rather plain profession where no one stalks you and asks you to show them your skills at root canal.)
Anyway, the rest of the movie plays on this theme throughout.  The low-light of the movie, and surely, after some distance, of this actress's career, is when Jamie Lee Curtis, playing a hippo Queen who is a plastic surgeon, sings about her ability to make everyone beautiful through her artistic abilities with the scalpel.  She sure can give Rudolph the nose he wants!  Now that Miss Curtis has come out against just this kind of thing and advocates aging without anxiety and without surgery--and wants to encourage young women to believe in their inner beauty (older women too!) rather than needing to ""fix"" what the society that is fashion magazines and Hollywood see as ""flaws"", she must want this one to get lost in a dust bin.

""Rudolph"" begins, preposterously, with a rendition of ""Jingle Bells. Yes, I said ""Jingle Bells,"" and not the namesake song.
Then the narration begins in mid-sentence (""...and all through the hills...""), clipping the first line. It does the same thing at the end: ""Merry Christmas to all, and --."" And WHAT? The visual and sound quality is also poor--my VHS copy, an older one we've watch hundreds (and hundreds, and...) of times, remains far superior in clarity.
But this edition saves its true savagery for ""Christmas Comes...."" Anyone who has seen the original knows this early Max Fleischer cartoon is a genuine classic for its sometimes dazzling animation, its inventiveness, and its score. Sadly, this edition obscures almost all of these qualities, and the result is barely watchable.
On top of being visually fuzzy, this edition of ""Christmas Comes"" has a botched soundtrack. The different tracks are out of sync, twisting the originally well-done score into pure cacophony. Even my two-year-old noticed. And my four-year old went ballistic.
The other cartoons on this edition are cute enough, but again they're dark visually--and only the first two are Christmas-themed.

I was pretty nervous that this movie wasn't going to be good,but I realy enjoyed it, I've always loved the 1964 classic Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. At some points the animation makes it look like a video game,and some of the character designs look weird. I loved the songs they sang though.
My little sister Sarah hates Hermey she calls him H instead. My oldest sister Randy thinks that Hermey is cute though. Me and my oldest sister noticed something about Hermey,his ears aren't pointy so that means he's not an elf,so how come everybody calls him an elf,I wonder if anybody ells has ever noticed that before,I think he was a kid that ranaway from home.
I loved the Toy Taker,and Queen Camilla,they were my favorite characters. Queen Camilla reminded me of my mom,because she's a parametic,and I loved her song to. I thought the Toy Taker was cool I loved the song he sang,I felt realy sorry for him though poor guy:(.He deserves to ruin christmas,just like how Washu( Tenshi Muyo)deserves to destroy the univurse.

1631407,1,B00005NB93,"On the surface, I rather like the idea of a new computer animated feature using characters from a classic stop-motion picture. The two art forms have quite a bit in common and it seems like a natural marriage. However, if the execution is as bad as it is in this DVD, I'd rather the potential be left unexplored.
The animation in this movie is terrible. Maybe it would have been impressive ten years ago, but since then we've been spoiled by the likes of ""Toy Story,"" ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" This movie can't possibly measure up. The motions are jerky, the backgrounds don't blend, any character with hair or loose fur looks terrible... if you've got the ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Shrek"" DVDs, you've seen the test animation they did on those two far superior films. This entire movie looks like that kind of animation.
And the story is.. okay, it's a kid's movie, but it's a REALLY predictable kid's movie. While I have to confess there were a few clever ideas -- the kite that's afraid of heights, for instance -- the music and story just are nowhere near as good as the original. Granted, that's a high bar to hurdle -- however, if you're going to fall this short, you'd be better off trying something else. Heck, the titular ""Island of Misfit Toys"" barely plays into the story at all.
If this movie had been made in the early 90s,  it might have been interesting. For a 2001 release, it just doesn't cut it. Save your money and get the classic Rankin-Bass ""Rudolph"" instead.",1039996800,,1477,4.573584905660377

For the first time since 1964, the complete, unedited version can be seen on this DVD.  Throughout the years, the special has been trimmed to allow for more commercial time, including the removal of a longer version of ""We Are Santa's Elves"", a duet reprise of ""We're A Couple Of Misfits.""  The edits where made as long ago as 1965, so getting the complete version is a real treat.  It even restores Rudolph's Elf friend's proper name, ""Hermey"" as opposed to the edited ""Herbie.""
Burl Ives has perhaps his most classic role as Sam the Snowman, singing many now-classic songs that were written for this program, such as ""Holly-jolly Christmas"" and ""Silver and Gold.""  (Of course, he also sings Johnny Marks wonderful ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!"")
The Animagic puppets are never more welcome than at Christmas.

1631413,4,B00005NB93,"There are three types of reviews worth ignoring for this video:
(1) Anyone who thought they were buying the 1964 classic.  Why would you trust the review of anyone that dumb?
(2) Anyone who says ""Rudolph is sacred.""  Rankin Bass et al. have already done two Rudolph sequels.  This isn't virgin territory.
(3) Anyone who says my kids loved it, but I hated it.  Just who are animated Christmas specials produced for, anyway?
Truth is that this could have been awful like Goodtimes Rudolph movie from a few years back.  This time the writers went out of their way to be faithful to the spirit of the original.  Nearly every moment pays homage to some element of the original Rankin & Bass production, from the opening credits to the concluding musical number.
Rankin & Bass's Rudolph sequels, great as they are, abandon all the other characters but Rudolph (even Santa was replaced by the Frosty Santa or the Year w/o Santa Claus Santa).  The writers of this try to pick up where the 1964 special left off, with Hermie and Clarice and Yukon et al. (no Fireball, unfortunately)
The songs are, with some exceptions, a definite attempt to draw on Rankin & Bass type orchestrations.  They aren't all as great as the Johnny Marks songs, but ""Best Christmas Ever"" is a worthy contender.
I was pleasantly surprised at how the writers were able to build on Romeo Muller's world from 1964 without wrecking it.  It's a fun, warm holiday special.  Real Rudolph fans ought to give it a chance.
My chief complaints are that the computer animation falls apart with Yukon and the Bumble and Yukon's voice is off.  These are really pretty minor complaints, however.

All the best elements are borrowed from the original Rankin/Bass specials. All the new character designs are lame. Plus, Rudolph's relapse into deep depression over his misfit nose gets old, really quick. There's nothing humorous about it and he comes across more as a pathetic whiner.
Stick with the originals...this weak effort, destined for obscurity, will only disappoint. Hardcore fans will be mortified.",1008720000,,822,5.37984496124031
1631423,4,B00005NB93,"Being a huge fan of the original 1964 Rankin/Bass puppet-animated masterpiece, I immediately took offense to this computer-animated sequel. So I watched this movie pretty intent on hating it. I would have preferred that if they were going to make a sequel, that they'd at least use stop-motion animation, but this was not bad. To my surprise - I actually enjoyed this special. I found it to be very colorful and Christmas-y looking, although the characters did lack facial emotions (at some points in the film, some of the characters reminded me of the ghosts from ""Pac-Man""). I'm not an expert on computer animation but I liked what was done here....a little bit weird....but weird is good.
The story was cute - it concerned the faceless Toytaker who sucks up toys through a giant vacuum into his blimp. Most of the original characters were here (Rudolph, Clarice, Hermey the Dentist, Yukon Cornelius, Charley-in-the-Box, King Moonracer etc...) as well as a few new ones (a different Snowman narrator, a pink hippo who performs plastic surgery on toys, a piggy bank with no slot for coins etc...) I felt, after viewing this, that the makers did actually have a genuine like and respect for their predecessor (after all, imitation is the highest form of flattery) and that they tried to keep the look and sound of everyone as close to the original as they could.
The burning question of the original....""What exactly was wrong with the doll that caused her to be on the Island Of Misfit Toys""?....is never answered in this sequel and I guess, will forever remain one of the great mysteries of our time.
The one thing I did not like about this special were the songs...the best of which were bare-able, the worst of which were pretty bad. While an excellent score like that of Rankin/Bass's ""Rudolph"" would be almost impossible to top, this one did not even come close.
But overall, a very enjoyable Christmas special (especially for kids) that I will probably watch again. However, I think when all is said and done....in a couple years, this show will fade away - like the other ""Good Times"" Rudolph remake a few years back - and the original classic will still be shining as brightly as Rudolph's nose!",1008547200,,2204,4.78740157480315

Which is good because I think that everyone's favorite part is the music.  It was kind of refreshing to see something not PC at all.  I haven't seen it in a couple of years and I was amazed at what would now would be considered harsh taunts but were the norm when I was growing up.  It was refreshing, because of course in the end it was all well.  Alls well that ends well.
The extras were rather nice.  The Rudolf quiz was cute and I am sure kids would love it.  Some of the other stuff was interesting, like the deleted song, although there wasn't a lot.

Stop motion animation has never been this charming and though I may be reviewing this with nostalgic-colored glasses, certain things about this TV special-made-into-DVD are undeniable.  The music of course is catchy, especially Burl Ives' Pillsbury Dough Boy persona belting tunes like ""Silver and Gold"" and ""Holly Jolly Christmas"".  All supporting characters are lovable and the message couldn't be any more universal and thoroughly modern: don't try to be anyone, but yourself.

There is no story line to keep a viewer interested.  My young son paid no attention at all.

1631427,4,B00005NB93,"I'll be the first to admit that GoodTimes has produced some, shall we say, ""less-than-perfect"" features over the years, but they have done very well here.  This tale was obviously made by people who have a great deal of love and respect for the 1964 classic original.  They have worked very hard to use computer animation to come as close as possible to the look of the old stop-motion animation, and I think they have succeeded.  The characters' movements are a bit smoother than the original, but that is about the only difference.
Returning from the '60s are Rudolph, the reindeer of the famous shiny nose, his dentist/elf buddy Hermie, the whacked-out miner Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable Snow Monster (will he ever learn to swim?), Rudolph's girlfriend Clarice, all of the minor characters, and of course, Santa Claus.  They have come together to investigate the mysterious Toy Taker, who has managed to succesfully pirate all the world's toys, including Santa's workshop itself.  The new actors provided to give voice to the classic characters all sound perfect.  Richard Dreyfuss does well in a role as the obligatory snowman narrarator (though I do miss Burl Ives), and Jamie Lee Curtis puts in an appearance as the Hippo Queen.  Rick Moranis provides the voice of the Toy Taker himself.
Like many others out there, I grew up watching the original stop-motion Rudolph every year.  I was a little worried that this wouldn't be any good, especially when I saw the GoodTimes label on it.  But, my kids LOVE it!  And, it was produced for them, after all.  This movie makes absolutely NO pretense whatsoever that it was designed and produced for anyone but preschoolers, and it certainly succeeded with mine.
As adults, we see the world with different perspectives than we did as little kids.  Nothing, no matter how well done, will ever recapture the joys of the specials we saw for the first time as little kids back when you only had a chance to watch these shows once or twice a year.  Especially since now you can buy them on DVD or VHS and watch them over and over, any time you want.  Anything is more special when you are a kid and it is only availble to watch once a year.
The animation is not the most top-notch out there, but then, it's not supposed to be.  It's more concerned with looking like the original, with all its flaws due to 60's technology.  And yes, the plot is not the most original in the world.  Any parent will figure out the identity and motives of the Toy Taker before the movie is half over.  But the kids will love it, and really, isn't that what it's all about??",1007424000,,2599,4.637554585152839

While the stop-motion animation seems just a wee-bit antiquated, everything else about ""Rudolph"" remains timeless.  The eccentric characters such as Herbie the Elf, Yukon Cornelius and the Abominable Snowman are unforgettable. The journey to the land of misfit toys -- toys which no children want -- is so sadly touching. The soundtrack, filled with sing-a-long classics, is one of the best, if not THE best, of all Christmas specials. Best of all is the grandfatherly Burl Ives in the role of narrating/singing snowman. Congenial and witty, Ives is the perfect host for this perfect holiday special. Overall, ""Rudolph"" endures because it delivers a timeless story in a very entertaining manner. Like a handful of Holiday classics -- ""Charlie Brown's Christmas"" and the animated ""Grinch"" come to mind-- ""Rudolph"" will undoubtedly entertain children for decades on end. Of course, we adults know that ""Rudolph"" isn't for kids only! Simply unforgettable.",1006992000,,1026,5.4125

Not only is it not stop motion anymore but the animation is horrible.  Maybe if it resembled something like Toy Story it would be more entertaining but the rendering of the animation was so simple that i felt like I was watching something that a beginning animation student made.

The only thing positive that I can say about it is that some of the voices were well done. Richard Dreyfuss's nasal whine, however, made his storyteller snowman sound villanous. The computer animation was mostly horrible. Considering that it would have been technically possible to make the production look just like the classic, I'm dumbfounded. All the sweeping & swirling camera moves made me dizzy, too.
I guess I shouldn't be surprized, though, as the folks at GoodTimes have burned me before. Their re-releases of stuff like the old Sherlock Holmes movies were terrible. I spent half the movie adjusting the tracking. But, I digress......

When I picked this out I thought that it would be cool cause the computer stuff looks exactly like the clamation that they used in the original on (except for Santa and the snowman). But they turned out to be very cheaply done.

1631436,2,B00005NB93,"This was a letdown. I was a huge fan of the old Rakin/Bass incarnation of Rudolph, and was excited to get this video, but I hafta say it's pretty low rent.
The animators did a fine job of creating computer models of the characters. Problem is, they seemed to stop there. Things are rendered often very basically, with no texture. Rudolph himself appears smooth and hairless, which may actually be a good thing seeing as how Bumbles' fur and Yukon Cornelias's beard appear to exist in a dimemsion slightly removed from the characters they're attatched to. It's not that I'm against the classic characters being rendered via computer animation, it's that I'm against them being rendered via BAD computer animation. Contrary to what the Amazon.com staff critic says, this movie doesn't look ""sharp"". In places, it looks quite bad.
It would be nice if the story and writing were interesting enough to carry the day despite the technical limitations, but they're not. Only a handful of clever moments are present in the film, and they aren't terribly brilliant. Also, the songs are downright painful.

1631440,2,B00005NB93,"I wasn't really thinking when I picked this movie up.  For some reason, I had thought that I had seen it before.  Within moments, I realized that was not the case.
  Misfits is a totally computer generated animated movie that has no creativity.  The writers borrowed heavily from the storyline of Toy Story 2 and spun their version at the sake of the classic Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Christmas special.  Albeit, they put a really dark spin on it.
  Enter the ""Toy Taker"" who steals every toy from all over the world, including Santa's toyshop.  Who is this mysterious person and why has he done this?  That's where Rudolph's continues.
  Rudolph leaps to the lead this time because he still feels outcast by nearly everyone living at the North Pole.  His problem now is he's being smothered by his new-found fame.  The exceptions are his old friends--Hermey (who's now a dentist), Clarice (Rudolph's girlfriend), and Cornelius and Bumbles the abominable snow monster (both of whom operate a failing peppermint mine).  Along the way, they pick up a few new friends.
  They eventually corner the ""Toy Taker"" and discover he's a teddy bear who was thrown away by his owner after the owner grew up.  Seeking his deranged justice, the teddy bear stole the toys so no other toy would have to share his fate.  However, even deranged toys have hearts.  So when Santa Claus explains the trashing of the teddy bear was all an accident, it's all forgive and forget and Christmas goes off without a hitch.
  Even though I found the storyline totally unoriginal, it was good enough to capture my girlfriend's baby's attention for an hour or so.  That was enough to convince me to give the show a second star to indicated it's not totally worthless, like its graphics are.
  I noticed a lot of problems with the graphics and wondered what tools they used.  I've seen much better animation generated by free piece-meal software from more than 7 years ago.  Some of the most recognizeable problems were the blacking out of Cornelius' beard whenever he turned his head to the choppy effects of the rolling ocean.
  Of the entire movie, the one thing I disliked the most was the decision to make Rudolph's shiny nose shine like a spot light into a concentrated area, such as a disco ball, instead of glowing.",1005177600,,2296,4.712846347607053

1631451,4,B00005NB93,"Filmation took a seemingly benign tale and infused the politics of the time (the women reindeer are assumed to need protection) with the foreshadowing of social change to come. I have seen this movie several times, and I would reccomend people sit down with their children and watch this movie together.
In the opening minutes, we learn Rudolph is different from other reindeer because of his nose (general physical disability)and feels like an outcast because the other reindeer shun him and think he is weird. Throughout my years in public school, I could completely relate to this character.
The island of Misfit toys contains some Toys that were misnamed but otherwise okay (The Charlie in the box), however the real political symbolism comes when we see the cho-choo with square wheels (he cannot walk), the spotted elephant (skin pigment problems) and the doll that cannot cry (gland problems), because this was produced during the time when conventional medical knowlledge reccomended the instutionalization of mildly disabled children on the grounds that they would be protected from harsh judgement, although they were still stigmatized because society knew they had some kind of physical disability/condition, or otherwise they would not have been separated to begin with.
As a person with a disability, I am very concious of this part of the film, and remain amazed how fast progress reversed this trend. While the film does suggest that eventually the different will find someone who loves them for who they are, it is also hinted that it is an impossiblity that would require a major miracle. Although the toys are presumed to not be as interesting or as 'toy smart' as the others, they indeed prove that people with disabilities are not without intellengence or skills.
Unlike Hermes, whose outcast status occurs because of a job occupation, the misfit toys and Rudolph did not have a choice if they wanted to be different. While it was never formally adressed in the film, we do not learn if they were made that way, or something happened in the transportation of already made toys that caused the difference.
Eitherway, this film provides a wonderful (if unintentional) tribute to diversity of ability, and is a nice break from the tradditional tendency to steer clear of anything too upity at this time of year.",992736000,,2328,5.033678756476684

1631454,5,B00005NB93,"This was and is my favorite Christmas special of all time. I have always watched it every year (I am now 27). I just bought the CD of the special's music and listen to it all day in work. Even though it was made in 1964, the special is still superb, and looks timeless. The only concern for parents I have with this special is, since it was made in the 1960's it sends some non-timeless messages to its viewers...specifically, some sexist issues. The line in particular I am thinking of was where Rudolph's father, after searching for Rudolph, thinks it's best ""to get back to the women and children"" as if they needed taking care of and couldn't do it themselves. *I still shudder when I hear that line.* If parents make sure that they teach their kids that women are as strong in character and ability as men, then there is no problem with this movie. I love it and always will...",976838400,,882,4.384146341463414

Who can forget about Sam the Snowman, Herbie (I want to be a dentist), Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable Snow Monster, and of course, Rudolph. I have watched this every year for at least the last 25 years. But now I don't have to check the TV Guide to find out when it's coming on. I can watch it whenever I want. When I was young, I used to wonder if my toys talked (wonder if this is where Toy Story got their idea). A perfect family movie that will make you laugh, cry, and be a little frightened. Excellent is all I have left to say.",976665600,,636,4.178861788617886
1631464,5,B00005NB93,One of the best Christmas classics of all time. Made in 1964 the stop-still animation quality is superb for the time period. Most importantly the story is heart warming and exciting. Burl Ives does a fantastic job as Sam the Snowman the storyteller. The songs are both touching and cheerful. No family home should be without this timeless classic. The Bumble will make you rumble!!!,976579200,,382,4.892307692307693
1631465,5,B00005NB93,"This is a Christmas classic from 1964 that I grew up watching, and it is just as much fun to watch it today with my three year old as it was then.  The film pioneered stop motion animation, which was used later in the popular ""Gumby"" TV series.  It features narration and songs by Burl Ives and they couldn't have picked a more loveable or jolly soul for the job.
All the little characters are adorable, especially the misfit toys.  This is my son's first year seeing this video, but he keeps asking for it every day.  He's already starting to sing the songs.  We were able to find a Rudolph stuffed animal which is a replica from the movie and he won't go anywhere without it.

1631469,4,B00005NB93,"Actually, this movie is quite good. Along with ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" this is my friend Amy's favorite Christmas special. The story (despite it's implausible characters) is actually well done. Rudolph is persecuted and isolated because of his harmless abnormality. Through his tragic isolation, he learns that others (like Hermie) suffer the same thing. Through the friendship of these two characters, they go on to find the toys who suffer the same feelings of isolation. It is striking that the king of the 'Island of Misfit Toys' does not permit them to hide from their problems, but rather, they are lead to doing something about it.  Once Rudolph and Hermie recognize that their problems are shared, they realize that they can not just run away. Rather, they have to do something and face their troubles. (In my opinion, it is even possible to wonder if the abominable snowman was so mean because he too felt persecuted and unwanted. After all, once Ucon Cornelius befriends him, he too helps bring Christmas everywhere.) Donner (Rudolph's father) is a real complex character. While he may appear hard and forceful, his actions are understandable. It is as if he can detect the tragic events that will distress his son. The author also makes Donner's concern for his son clear when he teaches Rudolph the dangers a reindeer faces.  He is struck with sorrow when he sees how much his son is persecuted. And, when Rudolph runs away, he risks his life to find his son. In addition to the fine story, we have nice scenery, entertaining characters, nice songs, suspense, and well placed comic relief. This truly deserves a place in the classic museum of Christmas videos.",973900800,,1682,4.919014084507042

Maybe the best thing about Rudolph is watching a young child watch it and love it.  It's like reliving your best Christmas memories all over again.",972604800,,390,4.16
1631471,4,B00005NB93,"The 2000 edition of the ""Rudolph"" DVD is definitely superior to the 1999 version, but the few improvements are probably not significant enough to warrant a second purchase.  The sound on this new edition may be slightly better than that of the previous disc (which warbled badly in a few spots), but it's still far from perfect.  The picture quality is very good, considering the age of the film.  Special features include: animated menus, the Rudolph trivia game, the ""Fame & Fortune"" song (which replaced the original ""We're a Couple of Misfits"" in 1965), a short TV promo (not very exciting), and a ten-minute introduction by Arthur Rankin.  Said introduction is somewhat informative, but I would have appreciated a more detailed explanation of how the ""Animagic"" process is done.  Another feature on this disc, called ""ReadSpeak"", is an innovative new captioning method which, when selected on the menu screen, shows written words coming out of the characters' mouths as they talk, thereby helping kids learn to read.  And don't miss the Pilsbury cookie dough commercial at the start of the feature!  In closing, if you don't own ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" on DVD, don't hesitate to pick this one up (it's not Christmas without Rudolph, right?).  But, if you already have the previous version in your collection, you might want to save your money.  Aside from the great new photo cover, the special features here really aren't all that impressive (and how they add up to a 135-minute total running time is beyond me).  For next Christmas, Sony should consider putting ""Rudolph,"" ""Frosty,"" and ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" on the same disc for one low price.",972432000,,1670,4.974820143884892
1631472,5,B00005NB93,Christmas wasn't christmas without Rudolph the red nosed reindeer and Frosty the snowman. I grew up watching these timeless masterpieces. My children and my grandchildren look forward every year to Rudolph the red nosed reindeer and  never tire of the story of that stormy night in christmas town and the plight of the cartoon characters. The wonderful narration by Burl Ives seems to make the story come alive. Every child should see this movie and learn to sing along with Rudolph the red nosed reindeer as well as the other unforgettable songs in this movie.,971308800,,561,4.905263157894737
1631473,5,B00005NB93,"Ups:  I wasn't born when this was made and aired... but I do remember seeing this nearly every year on TV.  Every year I still felt the same way... I loved it.
Your kids will love it.  At Christmas time, just having this around will entertain the children of your guests.  I find sing-a-longs so much easier after kids see this...  and caroling is a breeze after they frolic through this magical experience.
Burl Ives voice is incredible.  Very few people have the power, cheeriness, and wholesomeness naturally in their voices as much as Burl Ives does.  To me this ranks up there with the original 'Miracle on 34th Street' without being near so 'deep.'
This is a keeper.
Downs:  None.

1631474,5,B00005NB93,"This highly theatrical claymation Christmas ""special"" has justly earned the title ""classic"".  Though it might at first blush seem aimed squarely at children, it is so much more than a holiday confection.  With its well-drawn characters and story, and its bevy of melodic showtunes by Johnny Marks, this musical fable is enchanting and quite moving.  A story about fitting in, it has all the hallmarks of a cross-generational, true FAMILY piece of enduring entertainment.  Sing a long, shiver in fear, huddle in suspense, and delight all together in the colorful adventure of Rudolph, Hermey and friends, narrated by the warmly rendered Burl Ives/Sam the Snowman -- your Christmas will be merrier indeed.",970358400,,703,5.25
1631475,5,B00005NB93,"Do you recall the most famous reindeer of all?  Sam the Snowman does (voiced by the unforgettable Burl Ives) and he tells us the unknown story  behind the legendary ""Rudolph Song"":  When the other reindeer  won't let him play in all the reindeer games, rejected, red-nosed Rudolph  goes on a quest to find himself.  He meets up with another misfit, Herbie  the Elf, who leaves Santa's reknown toymaking elves to pursue his life-long  career in dentistry (""You wanna be a what? "").  Together with the  help of the affible gold miner, Yukon Cornelius (who's on his own quest to  track down the Bumble - that's the Abominable Snow Monster to you and me)  they find the island home of the Misfit Toys who just want to be loved  (hey, before there was ""Toy Story,"" there was the Island of  Misfit Toys. )  Rudolph and friends return to the North Pole in time to  find a frantic Santa ready to cancel Christmas on account of a blustery  storm.  But Rudolph's ""shiny nose, so bright"" helps Santa guide  his sleigh through the fog...and rest, as Sam the Snowman says, goes down  in his-tor-y.
Christmas just ain't Christmas without watching RUDOLPH,  THE RED-NOSED REINDEER.  This is my favorate Holiday cartoon (closely tied  with Santa Clause is Coming To Town).  This stop-motion animation classic  paved the way for more recent animators like Tim Burton to flesh out the  medium, so to speak.  But nothing touches the heart and soul of Christmas  like this story does.  I'll admit it, I still wait for it to come on every  year just so I can sing along and hear some of my favorate lines again:  ""I'm cuuuute. She said I'm cuuuute!"" , ""Bumbles  bounce!"" and ""Eat.  No one likes a skinny Santa"" to name  just a few.  Am I glad it's out on DVD?  Yes!  But, as always I wish,  wish, wish that there could be some extras included.  Even just a little  making of featurette.  Ah well, at least now I can pop in my favorate  holly, jolly Christmas special anytime I want.

After nearly 20 years, I still laugh at the  jokes, and sing along with Sam the Snowman. It's a delightful tale of  individuality, growing up, and responsibility (all that in a 60 minute  Christmas show!) that tells kids to follow their own path and never give  up. Plus, the animation is wonderful and the characters are all adorable -  even the Bumble! - Yet I never knew why the little doll was a misfit.

I was immediately impressed by the video -  vibrent color - clean sharp images, a wonder to behold - then came the let  down THE SOUNDTRACK - How could this be?  How could so much work be  done on the video end and none on the soundtrack. The soundtrack was almost  painful to listen to at times. During many of the songs the fluxuations in  pitch and general wobbel of the musical accompaniment made me grimace and  want to cover my ears. How could this be released like this?  On  the plus side we get to see Rudolph in it original form - Elf Orchestra  during ""We Are Santa's Elves"" - the orignal reprise of  ""We're a couple of Misfits"" ( replacing the shorter ""Fame  and Fortune"" - it would have been nice to have this as a bonus track  added as an extra) plus extra seconds of the show that you never see  anymore pop up unexpectedly and fill you with delight.

1631484,5,B00005NB93,"Rankin-Bass' ""Rudolph"" has been a X-mas classic for 35 years.  The home video and network prints of the show had taken on a reddish tint until Golden Books digitally remastered the print in 1998.  With noticably  sharper visuals and restoration of the original colors, Rudolph never  looked better!  Also new to the home video is the restoration of almost  three minutes of footage not seen since 1964 (the first year it aired on  CBS).  The additions include ""We are Santa's Elves,"" restored to  its original full-length, complete with a quintet of elves playing a tuba,  a xylophone, a tympani, a violin, and a harp.  Also returned to the show is  a very cute duet by Rudolph and Hermey the Elf, singing ""We're a  couple of misfits.""  This song is especially crucial to the  establishment of Rudolph and Hermey's relationship, as they bond in their  misery.  Unfortunately, it was snipped from the show beginning with the  1965 network airing (at the request of GE, the sponsor) and replaced with  the much shorter and inferior ""Fame and Fortune.""  Because of the  way the song is set-up, ""Fame and Fortune"" no longer appears in  the restored show for continuity reasons.  There's also a restored scene at  the end of the show where Yukon Cornelius discovers a peppermint mine at  the North Pole.  The restoration and color-corrections aside, the story  remains the same:  Rudolph and Hermey overcome prejudice and bigotry (Santa  Claus sure wasn't very PC in the beginning of the show!), Rudolph leads  Santa's team of reindeers, Hermey becomes a dentist, and the unwanted toys  are rescued from the Island of Misfit Toys.

Rudolph is doubtless his best-loved work.  I remember  watching the film as a child, delighted and enraptured by the story that it  told.  Do you remember?  Sam the Snowman as narrator (voiced and sung in  the performance of a lifetime by Burl Ives); Rudolph the misfit and  rejected reindeer; Rudolph's friend, Hermy the Elf, also a misfit because  he doesn't like to make toys but wants to be a dentist; Yukon Cornelius,  the prospector who befriends them both; the Abominable Snowmonster of the  North (whom Yukon, in prospector slang, invariably calls a  ""bumble""); the Island of Misfit Toys, and its winged lion  monarch; and many other characters and story threads. The presentation,  interweaving, and resolution of all of these elements is positively  Shakespearean in deftness, wit, poetic beauty and brevity of expression,  depth, pathos, joy, moral instruction, and the sense that all ends as  indeed it should.
