IN YOUR HOUSE
GREATEST MATCHES

This is a tape form the Coliseum days of the WWF which is as the title says, best of In Your House.

1. BRET HART VS JERRY LAWER-I have always liked when these two would go at it, I don't know why but I liked the feud between these two. The story here was Bret had faced Hakushi earlier in the event and won, but hurt his knee. Of course that was all faked as he really wanted to get one over on Lawler. Kinda more of a brawl as these two go at it, Bret is in control most of the time until the ref is knocked into the ropes. As the ref is tied up in the ropes Hakushi hits the ring. After three or so flying head buts The King pins Hart for the win. This match took place at the first ""In Your House"" event.

2.[I-C TILE]SHAWN MICHAELS VS JEFF JARRETT-one of the best matches on the tape for sure and actually one of my all time favorites. This has got to be one of Jarrett's best matches ever for sure, and Shawn is always great. Jarrett does very well in this match with The Roadie at ringside until he interferes and accidentally cost JJ the match. HBK of course was going to win any way since he is the greatest of all time, personal opinion. This match was on the second ""IYH"" event, one of the best matches from this set. The pace of this match was excellent was never boring at all, great job by both competitors.

3. GOLDUST VS MARTY JANETTY-this match was Goldust's debut and he did a great job here with his character. Marty was always a guy that could have been such a huge player and was one of the most skilled guys in there. Here he has a good match with Goldust but comes up short. This match was on the forth ""IYH"" event and is a much better match than people give it credit for. This was when Goldust was being taken seriously, I wish they would use him like this again.

4.[CASKET MATCH]UNDERTAKER VS KING MABEL-this was a casket match that took place during Taker's feud with Mabel who had also won the King of the Ring that year. This was also during the time that Taker wore the creepy mask to protect his face. This was your typical big man match with high impact moves and such but the story here was Taker getting his Urn back even though it was now a chain that Moe melted down. Taker gets the win after putting both Mabel and Moe in there and slamming the lid shut. This match was held at the fifth ""IYH"" event.

5.[WWF CHAMPIONSHIP STEEL CAGE MATCH]BRET HART VS DIESEL-now I am a big fan of Bret Hart and of Nash for that matter so every time they hooked up I enjoyed it. This like the others was a fun match and then you add in the WWF title and a steel cage, you know you will like it. This match took place at the sixth ""IYH"" as the main event of course and was a great brawl between the two. Full of high impact moves and near escapes as if you didn't know. The action is back and forth but it is the end that most people remember. As Diesel is making his way to the door the Undertaker comes up from the ring and pulls Diesel into hole. Bret of course escapes and retains the title. Taker did this as pay back for Diesel costing him the title at The Rumble earlier that year.",1312156800,4,3144,4.0792880258899675
