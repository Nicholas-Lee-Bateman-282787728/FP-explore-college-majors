""Some people say there are ghosts."" Some say there are no ghosts. ""But I say: Hui Buh is a ghost!"" These lines, which in the film are spoken by Hui Buh storyteller Hans Paetsch, have filled German nurseries for more than about 30 years. Hui Buh, the lovable and clumsy castle ghost, who in the audio book and book series of the same name by Eberhard Alexander Burgh, has moved over 20 million times across shop counters, attracts even today spirits of all ages. It was only a matter of time before Hui Buh, in the computer-animated form of Michael Bully Herbig, came to see the light of the big screen. This fun filled ghostly comedy, without rough edges for the whole family, was directed by Sebastian Niemann, who with films such as ""The Jesus Video"" or ""7 Days To Live"" has already proven his penchant for the supernatural. European stars such as Rick Kavanian, Christoph Maria Herbst, Heike Makatsch, or Wolfgang Vlz ensure that even adult viewers can feel well entertained. However, this film with its harmless horror gags, is definitely geared towards a younger audience. For one last time you get to see Hans Clarin, whose voice is forever bound as that of the original Hui Buh, voicing him in the audio book series for nearly three decades. He plays the old Castellan, who in the movie assists Hui Buh with his wisdom - shortly before his real life death 2005.

Great movie to watch with younger kids if you speak and understand German.",1350000000,,1477,4.680769230769231
