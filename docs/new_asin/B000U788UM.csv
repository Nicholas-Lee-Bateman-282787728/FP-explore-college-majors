2917067,5,B000U788UM,"This DVD is excellent. Highly recommended. The ten questions are asked by an interviewer and not originated by the Dalai Lama. The questions are very good... ""Why are poor people so happy?""",1196812800,3,189,4.9375
2917068,5,B000U788UM,I have long been an admirer of Tibetan culture and its particular form of Buddhism. I found this film to be absoultly delightful and informative. Everyone needs to be aware of Tibet's plight at the hand of the Chinese communist regime. The most insightful and gentle civilization on Earth is slowly being destroyed.,1196467200,5,315,4.962264150943396
2917069,4,B000U788UM,"This is a great film, but I so enjoy listening to the Dalai Lama that I wish the interview portions of the film were longer.  I understand Rick Ray only had 45 minutes with the Dalai Lama so it is understandable.  The historical background information on Tibet and China was similar to what you get in most documentaries on this topic, but Rick Ray's personal journey through India was a unique approach we don't often see.  The scenery and landscapes are phenomenal.  I showed this film to a group of 90+ high school students who voluntarily stayed after school to view it.  They loved it and were captivated by his Holiness.",1195862400,3,626,4.603603603603603

2917071,4,B000U788UM,"This is a very gentle documentary film of the most famous monk in the world, his humble origins and his joint role as spiritual and political leader of Tibetans.

It's combination of background and insertion of clips to illustrate points during the actual interview with his holiness enhances what would be to most people a relatively staid movie. What results is an interesting story of a man who insists that he is but a man despite everything which his many follwers wish upon him. He is his own person, someone who wishes his own privacy despite the pressure upon him to be a purely public figure.

The documentary also deals with real political difficulties, addressing the issue of China and accusing the Chinese government in all but name of the kidnap of the Panchen Lama, yet managing to maintain some degree of impartiality so that it avoids the charge of being mere propaganda.

We learn much too, of the filmmaker and his observations, especially where he notes that it is those with least who display outward signs of happiness while those who have the most are the least happy.

Overall this is well worth watching especially to gain some insight into the mind of one of the most influential men of the 20th Century. After having watched this film today, I was reminded of the famous remark of Stalin who is reported to have asked: ""How many legions has the Pope?"".
Perhaps China's current rulers would be advised to ask the same question about the Dalai Lama.",1192838400,25,1474,4.723735408560311

It was absolutely fascinating from beginning until end. Tha Dalai Lama is one incredible man and Rick Ray did an really nice job of capturing some beautiful images and putting together this film.

Based on the description, I had assumed it would mostly be a recording of the questions and responses, but actually each topic is given plenty of attention. Clips from historical films are used to weave an account of the Dalai Lama's journeys; out of naive childhood, out of Tibet, through the political landscape of the US and India, and so on.  Very balanced perspective on the Chinese repression of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama's approach to dealing with the Chinese government without hatred, and his utilization of the tools of nonviolence.

2917091,4,B000U788UM,"I found this to be a great documentary. Half of it is a neat exploration of Northern India, the other half an informative look at the Dalai Lama. There is, however, one glaring inaccuracy here. Rick Ray states that the Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama is the reincarnated Buddha. That is totally INCORRECT. He is thought to be the reincarnation of Avalokitesvara, the boddhisatva of compassion. I know it's only 1 piece of information, but it's a big one. The whole thing about enlightenment, and the Buddha's attainment of nirvana, is that one escapes the cycle of rebirth. I'm not even sure how one could get this wrong, since even a novice's introduction to Buddhism will make this obvious. Anyway, that point aside, I would recommend this.",1369094400,,751,4.875
2917092,5,B000U788UM,"Beutiful photography, very interesting story, and enlightening about Buddhism, inspiring, and fulfilling. I'm going to see and hear the Dalai Lama in a few weeks and this film was a great introduction to knowledge about him.",1367539200,,224,5.25

2917094,4,B000U788UM,"This was a great DVD on the subject of the Chinese invasion, the holocaust of the Tibetans and the response of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. There is just one major flaw that could have been corrected but no one thought to research the matter.

This Dalai Lama is believed to be the 14th incarnation of the prior Dalai Lama's who were and are all an embodiment of the celestial Bodhisattva Chenrezi, known as Avaloketsvara in India/Sanskrit and as Kuan Yin in China and Kannon in Japan.

Yet, this Director repeats many times that he is believed to be a reincarnation of the Buddha. Absolutely not!

There are many aspects to Vajrayana or Tibetan Buddhism and one is that all sentient beings have a true Buddha Nature... only to that extent can we say that anyone is an incarnation of the Buddha.

Otherwise, this is informative and caring in its presentation.

Thank you, Namaste and Shalom,
Dr. Arlette Poland

2917095,4,B000U788UM,"""I am just a simple human being. This is nothing special. I come from a small village with no modern education and no awareness of the outside world"" -14th Dalai Lama. First I would like to start off by talking about the profound shock that I had after watching this movie. I never knew that the land of Tibet was so oppressed by the Chinese and as many as 1.2 million people were killed. This movie gave me a general conscious idea of what Tibet and northern India is like today. Tibet's freedom, liberty, and unity have vanished, whilst India is constantly putting everything in perspective, life and poverty. After showing the visual component of his journey I realized that the life they have is very hard. It's not like ours where it is 'unsatisfactory' or 'stressful' it is downright hard. At the age of 15 the Dalai Lama was striped of his freedom's. This caused the country's most divine leader to flee to India for asylum. He had to support his country in exile. Think about it, the Dalai Lama is like ''Jesus in the white house'' he is a living incarnation of Buddha and he had to flee from his country. After he did this many of his people followed. The questions that Ricky Ray asked him were very sentimental, in my opinion. But Dalai Lama's answers were compassionate, honest, and disciplined. Moreover, I thought this was a very interesting documentary. It made me think about moral/political issues that I have never thought about. I would definitely give this movie a 8 out of 10 because the Dalai Lama is no ordinary, simple human being he is a man that is a hero fighting for liberty in silence.",1353196800,,1614,4.568965517241379
2917096,4,B000U788UM,"10 questions for the Dalai Lama is a very inspiring movie. I thought it was clear enough that a teenager was able to understand it and it wasn't too complicated or deep. It was interesting enough that you wouldn't get bored and it held your attention. The questions were relatable and gave you good insight.
 I think the scenery was very pretty and well filmed. The movie also helped me gain a greater knowledge of China and Tibet. I knew that Tibet wanted freedom but the film really showed the ruthlessness of China.
 I think that one of the questions I liked the most was why are the poorest people the happiest. I find that relatable because I always find that the poorer people are the happiest and I've personally always wondered why. The Dalai Lama's answer was that richer people have more to worry about. I now understand the answer because when I see it in the world now and it's true.
 I also liked the Dalai Lama's reasons of non-violence. If you use the force of a gun you are showing weakness because you're not strong enough just to use your words to get your point across. There are more powerful ways than violence such as smiling. I thought it was a cool little fact that the Dalai Lama even has email. Overall it was a good inspiring movie that helps you understand non-violence and the history of Tibet. They show the Dalai Lama as a very humble and likeable person. Most modern politicians don't have these qualities.",1352505600,,1438,4.523076923076923
2917097,5,B000U788UM,"Appreciated the rich warp and weft of this documentary: an intense and intimate interview interspersed with flashbacks not only to 14th Dalai Lama's childhood (with photos & stories) but stock archival footage from Chinese invasion and atrocities against Buddhists generally.
I also grokked Rick Ray's devotion to his subject.  Make sure you catch his interview within Special Features section; the Director's pathway (in India) to find -- and engage -- the Dalai Lama presents akin to answering a Zen Buddhist koan(Use your intuition:)
We then tour the Dalai Lama's current hometown-in-exile, Dharamsala,to understand where and how he spends 1/2 of his year -- when not traveling as world's #1 Peace SuperStar. What a contagious sense of humor and endearing spontaneity is still evident in this 75-year-old wise child! Moveover, I always magically feel calmer having been in his presence -- even via a DVD.",1308096000,,907,5.298611111111111
2917098,5,B000U788UM,I LOVED this film! It was amazing and really mind opening! It has inspired me to look further into the Dalai Lama and even Buddhism.,1290470400,,132,4.32
2917099,5,B000U788UM,"Exquisite film that is much more than the title suggests. It's really a travelogue through Tibetan history and the Dalai Lama's biography, capped off with the Dalai Lama's answers to ten tough questions.",1263600000,,203,5.181818181818182
2917100,3,B000U788UM,"The Dalai Lama seems like a great guy, but if you didn't know his ways you might find him a little disconcerting.  Rick Ray, the filmmaker, yearned to get some footage of the man, but the production company that sent him to India had neglected to tell Dharamsala that he was coming, so he found himself in utter despair, thousands of miles from home in a caste-ridden land where he didn't know a soul, with no date with his target.  The resulting film is the result of his coming up with Plan B (the whole movie might be called, ""Plan B"") which was to contact the press office and ask for a brief interview.  I don't know why.  It seems like Dalai is very familiar with being interviewed, and has felt the ambiguous kiss of the camera's gaze upon his handsome face since a very young age.  Why. he has been famous since 1938 or so and really knows how to play to the camera.

Ray doesn't seem to be able to penetrate much beyond the public face of the Dalai Lama.  Is there a private face?  Maybe he's one of those celebrities who are always on, like William Burroughs used to be and like John Waters is always John Waters.  Footage of Dalai twenty years ago is exactly the same as footage of today--the illusion is aided considerably by clever use of his standard red and saffron colored robes and the same style glasses.  And always that unearthly laugh, promoted by his fans as his ""sense of humor,"" but in Rick Ray's well-researched documentary that laugh keeps coming out at unexpected, not to say unwarranted places, like the Joker locked up in Arkham Asylum.  Rick gets high marks from me for not betraying even by the blink of an eyelash, any surprise or alarm when that infernal laugh floats up into the high corners of the palace.  He just sits there, like a man, knees apart, elbows on Indian exile chair, and a sort of smile plays over his lips, he breathes stertorously like a man thinking thoughts so ecstatic they seem almost visible.  Oh s--t, I'm sitting right here and the f&&ing Dalai Lama is answering my 10 questions!  Play it cool, buddy, play it cool.

It seems so sad that, when Dalai finally leaves us, the Chinese have kidnapped the child lama who ws supposed to help locate the next him.  Worse, they have brought onto the stage their own impostor child lama, whom Rick Ray regards with utmost suspicion.  He doesn't seem to have much good to say about anything Chinese.",1262908800,,2397,4.4735632183908045
2917101,1,B000U788UM,"I'll be short here, because most has been said already by the other reviewer who gave one star. This is an incredibly badly researched film, superficial to the extreme, and full of embarrassing platitudes. Why do poor people seem so much happier than rich people? The filmmaker has apparently never actually bothered to get to know some of the poor people he refers to. A smiley face does not mean a happy life, especially in Asia.
To actually get the privilege to interview the Dalai Lama personally, and not even do the most basic homework first, is in my opinion an incredible show of disrespect for the Dalai Lama (who has a very busy schedule).
The film does seem to satisfy a certain Western desire for happy poor people and saintly Buddhist Tibetans, and perhaps this explains the many good reviews. But if you want to learn something about the Dalai Lama or the Tibetans, then better watch another film or better yet, read a book.",1260748800,8,938,4.656626506024097
2917102,1,B000U788UM,"Travel ""filmmaker"" Rick Ray didn't seem to do the most basic kind of research about Buddhism or the Dalai Lama despite having had at least 3 full months to prepare. Due to his background as a travel filmmaker, perhaps he is used to oversimplifying complex subjects for easy digestion by a distraction-seeking audience. But when you are granted an audience with an extremely busy world figure and religious leader, you really should prepare properly. Shame on you, Rick Ray.

The resulting film is dull and superficial in the extreme, overflowing with random footage of people staring into the camera while the narrator drones on and on with his ill-informed hypothesizing about the human condition, full of platitudes about happy poor people and tales of feeling ""close to heaven"" inside a monastery.

And his 10 questions? Incredibly vague & simple minded stuff like ""why do poor people seem to be happier than rich people?"" and ""how important is it to preserve tradition?"" When speaking about Middle East tensions, the Dalai Lama says there is too much anger, hatred & negativity and that these high emotions need to first be ""cooled down"" before more constructive action can be taken on the serious issues facing them. He suggests (half jokingly) that festivals & picnics would be a good way of achieving this *first* step. The narration immediately proclaims: ""so festivals were the answer to peace in the middle east"". I cannot describe my utter disbelief when I heard that. I wanted to yell at my screen ""THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID AT ALL!!"" Not only has he done no research, but he apparently didn't pay any attention to the interview itself - either at the time or while editing.

Time and again, he seemed intent on squeezing the Dalai Lama into a preconceived box he's made for him. At one point, Rick Ray drones: ""it might come as a surprise to learn that although he PROSCRIBES festivals as the answer for peace around the world, he personally dislikes them, especially when they're in his honor."" In addition to repeating his obvious misinterpretation about festivals, no one who knows anything about the Dalai Lama would have been surprised by that - it's perfectly in line with his humility as someone who routinely describes himself as an ordinary person from a small town. As I continued watching the film, I got the distinct impression that Rick Ray was treating his subject almost as an idiot savant, wasting his time with ridiculously simple questions and offering to re-interpret the answers for the audience (and totally misinterpret it in the process).

To add to all this, the filmmaker has inserted himself into this film far too much. For example, he worries out loud about not wasting the precious 45 minutes he's been allowed for the interview and that if the Dalai Lama were to cut it short (because he's been known to do that if he senses you're a disingenuous fool), it would be the most humiliating experience of his life. I say ""who cares?"" He should have just spent his time PREPARING for the interview instead of narcissistically recording HIMSELF worrying about it out loud. This is not a documentary but an ill-informed, self-absorbed, not at all ready for prime time, grade school-level personal diary that should have been uploaded directly to YouTube. At best.",1259539200,25,3297,4.892665474060823
2917103,5,B000U788UM,"10 Questions For The Dalai Lama fascinated me from the very beginning; I had until now little knowledge of the history of Tibet and this DVD about their spiritual leader who is also their head of state in exile will hold your attention, too! The film flows very nicely; Rick Ray really put this together rather well and the footage shows India close to where the Dalai Lama and his followers live; excellent archival footage of the Communist Chinese forces overtaking Tibet and killing tens of thousands of people and the footage of Rick's interview with the Dalai Lama himself is more than worth the price of admission alone! The cinematography is terrific, too.

The film starts with director/writer Rick Ray narrating as we watch him doing a film project for next-to-nothing in India in order to get an interview with the Dalai Lama. However, when Rick gets to India he soon discovers that the promise of such an interview was bogus and he's on his own if he wishes to meet this spiritual, political leader and sage. Fortunately for Rick, his guide tells him that the Dalai Lama has his monks reading email on the Internet; and eventually Rick lands an interview with the Dalai Lama himself. Rick is nervous, however; he has heard that if the Dalai Lama does not consider you to be sincerely interested in a meaningful conversation he will simply dismiss you. Rick also faces tough time constraints--he has only 45 minutes and he is limited to asking the Dalai Lama only 10 questions.

This film also shows the history of the Dalai Lama and his predecessors who were all picked with great care; and we see terrific footage of the current Dalai Lama trying so hard to be nice to the Chinese when he first had power as the leader of Tibet. We also see graphic footage of how the Chinese overran Tibet; and these atrocities committed by the Chinese are not easy to swallow. The Dalai Lama had to put his boyhood behind him; and he even had to flee in disguise to make it out safely without being captured by Chinese forces. Many Tibetans who escaped the brutality of Chinese forces also fled and followed their leader to the town of Dharamsala in Northern India where the government of India provides them with a place to live.

Then comes the big interview--what will Rick ask the Dalai Lama? Be prepared to see Rick gain incredibly meaningful and wonderful insight from this exceptionally thoughtful man who is actually put on the spot when one unanticipated question from Rick comes up and needs a good answer. It's a terrific interview to say the least.

The DVD comes with an interview with director/writer Rick Ray, an interview with the man who is the personal secretary to the Dalai Lama and additional scenes not in the final cut of the movie. These are excellent features.

This documentary which also features a unique, up close and personal look at the Dalai Lama was made with care and compassion for him and his people. I highly recommend this film for people studying the Dalai Lama; the importance of a free Tibet and other issues related to the Tibetan people.",1256083200,2,3077,4.6802218114602585
2917104,4,B000U788UM,"85 minutes. Rick Ray describes the film perfectly in one of the bonus features: ""... a tapestry of my personal journey, my thinking of the questions, his biography, the Tibetan struggle, and then his answers all woven together into one story.""

After traveling around India, including visiting Ladakh where Tibetan culture and lifestyle still flourish, Rick Ray visits the Dalai Lama's monastery in Dharamsala. He interviews the Dalai Lama's secretary and then has an hour with the Dalai Lama. Among the 10 questions, he asks the Dalai Lama about why the poor often seem happier than the rich, about Tibetan traditions and culture, and the China issue. Often laughing aloud, the Dalai Lama answers the questions with simple, yet profound, insight. Ray intersperses film footage with the answers.

Rick Ray shows lots of rare archival footage that he was able to find, including the young Dalai Lama in 1939, the Chinese invasion, the Dalai Lama after he fled to India, and his acceptance speach for the Nobel Peace Prize. The modern footage of Lhasa shows kids on go-carts across from the Potala Palace, the ever increasing number of Chinese, and the ever present security cameras, resulting in what the Lama refers to as a ""cultural genocide.""

Bonus features are a 19-minute interview with Rick Ray, a 52-minute interview with the Dalai Lama's secretary Tenzin Geyche Tethong, and 17 minutes of six deleted scenes.

I highly recommend this film as a basic overview of the Dalai Lama and his philosophy, and the Tibetan issues. If you are looking for in depth analysis, this is not the film for you. The film could have been a bit tighter if some of the Indian travel was moved to the deleted scenes. I especially enjoyed seeing the Dalai Lama's playful side, where he doesn't pay attention at long pageants and celebrations, and dashes delightfully into the crowd that had gathered to watch a religious procession because he recognized someone there. The soundtrack by Peter Kater is very good, with beautiful piano playing with occasional flute and chanting.

Two Dalai Lama quotes I really liked are: ""Destruction of your enemy is also destruction of yourself."" In the U.S.: ""I don't admire your weapons. I admire your principles: democracy, liberty, freedom.""",1254268800,3,2264,5.026666666666666

 He called the local military there arrogant which I did not agree w/.
 They weren't being arrogant - it was a 1 lane road & they had the right of way.  They were honking their horn for the right reason.
 If anyone actually bothers to read the driving manual, no matter what State or even Country you're in - it'll state the same reason for honking the horn.

The Dalai Lama admits truthfully that, though Budhism highly regards life, there is too much life ... that the correct value of life is for high quality of life, not high quantity of life which ultimately devalues life.  It is worth the price of the DVD just to hear the Dalai Lama say that.",1227052800,,337,4.508196721311475
2917111,4,B000U788UM,"In ""10 Questions for the Dalai Lama,"" documentary filmmaker Rick Ray journeys to Dharamsala in northern India to speak with the man he describes as both a ""humble Buddhist monk"" and a ""rock star of peace,"" and who is believed by many to be the reincarnation of Buddha here on earth (though the Dalai Lama himself denies this, insisting that he is a mere mortal like everyone else).

You don't have to be a believer or even a particularly spiritual person to be moved and inspired by this film, which provides us with a rare up-close-and-personal look at one of the key religious figures in the world today.  What comes out both in the interview and in the various glimpses we are given of him in his meetings with many of the world's movers and shakers in government and religion, is just what a fun-loving, down-to-earth, and self-effacing a man he truly is, even though he is never shy about confronting injustice whenever or wherever it rears its ugly head.  Much of that feistiness derives, of course, from his own experience of having to flee his native Tibet in the early 1950's when the Communist Chinese invaded that country, and then being forced to live as an exile in a foreign land ever since.

To a disinterested observer, the Dalai Lama may seem, in many ways, to be a walking contradiction; an advocate for the ancient art of transcendence through meditation, he is also a passionate devotee of science and a champion of modern technology (his monks are very ""hep"" to the internet, and he, himself, is well-versed in quantum physics and neuroscience).  In fact, if there is disagreement between science and religion, he will generally come down on the side of science.  Fiercely ecumenical and tolerant of the beliefs of others, he's quick to point out the flaws in his own traditional beliefs when they conflict with the more enlightened ways of the modern world (the elimination of the caste system, equality for women etc.).  The Dalai Lama comes across as a man ruled as much by the practical concerns of having to exist in a highly diverse, multicultural world as by his obviously innate love for humanity itself.

But it is when confronted with the question of how to respond to evil in the world that this man shows what he is truly made of.  A passionate believer in civil disobedience (like Jesus, Gandhi and Martin Luther King before him), the Dalai Lama stays true to his principles by not calling for violent action even against his own people's oppressors, the Chinese.  He still believes, all these years later, that more can be gained by engaging on a personal level with one's enemy than by fighting them.  That's a bit tough for us in the West to understand, especially when the film shows us the terrible suffering and injustice the Tibetan people have endured under Communist rule.  Yet, when you hear him speak, it's impossible not to be convinced by the depth of his wisdom and the force of his moral character.

Going beyond the conversation itself, Ray provides fascinating background information on the history of Buddhism, the invasion of Tibet, and the biographical details of the Dalai Lama himself, including how he was chosen for this exalted position, how he spent his childhood, how he fled the invaders when still a teen, and how he has dedicated his life since to fighting, through nonviolent means, for the restoration of Tibet to its rightful people.

Filled with exquisite vistas and beautiful images of nature, Ray's film is a passionate cry for justice as well as a finely-wrought, contemplative vision of a leader who calls upon the better angels in all of us to help make this world a more peaceful place both for ourselves and those who will come after us.",1219708800,2,3712,4.752721617418351
2917112,5,B000U788UM,"Though wise beliefs, and a gentle spirit are evident in this man; it is clearly his sense of humour that struck me the most.  Add to this the genuiness and authticity with which he greats the people of the world and I must say this film had a profound impact on me.  Though some here have questioned the film makers take on things, I would suspect the Lama himself only embraced this work and saw it as a step in the right direction - that is he would have commented on it with gentleness, humility and acceptance.  I thought Mr Ray's back drop of history, off set the Dali Lama's message beautifully provding a rich context from which one can understand just how breath-taking his acceptance of the modern China is.  His answers to world problems are profound in their simplicity and in his conviction.  Coming from a evangelical Christian tradition myself, this man lives out the beliefs of my own spirituality as or more effectively than the Christian leaders of our day.  And yet, he would not see it that way...it is said ""the humble will inherit the earth"" ... if such is true I hope that what ever a person's spiritual convictions,that the key ideas in this film will not need to be diminished or attacked - i.e. win-win problem solving, openess, peace via non-violent means, acceptance of science as a useful tool in religion, religious tolerance, love, gentleness and respect, that attachment to things brings misery, the place of women and the poor in regards to power.  I think these are the very messages my Lord taught also...and though there are key differneces from my perspective surely we can learn from each other if openess and acceptance are practiced.  This documentary is well worth the time and my hope is it might even change a few hardened hearts.  Mr Rick Ray thanks for your noble efforts and risk taking to bring this too us.",1216944000,3,1853,4.6422018348623855
2917113,5,B000U788UM,"This is definitely a documentary for our times.  Rick Ray did an excellent job of combining current conditions he observed, prior to his meeting with the Dalai Lama, which helped him formulate his 10 questions he asked. These questions are pertainent to the challenges facing Tibetan Buddhists, in terms of its relationship to China, as well as how world events effect all of us.  Greed, the desire to have more (and never feel content vs. having nothing and being happy), and living in an over populated world (just a few of the topics discussed) are individual issues, perhaps, each one of us need to look at.  You need not be a Buddhist to consider these issues.  These are universal.  The Dalai Lama's anwsers were not difficult to understand; they were down-to-earth, common sense.  As always, the Dalai Lama never ceases to amaze me with his compassion for all sentient beings.  Though he considers himself to be a ""simple monk,"" I truly believe his is the living embodiment of the Buddha of Compassion. (And then there's his robust laugh which is infectious. I had tears in my eyes from laughing so hard.)

Unfortunately, it's too bad that Ray only had 45 minutes to talk with the Dalai Lama.  More questions popped into my mind as the two men conversed. I wonder if Ray felt that way too.  Overall, as a Buddhist I walked away with a new awareness and food for thought.  However, I'm deeply concerned about what will happen to Tibetan Buddhism once Dalai Lama passes over.  Will China euthanize all Tibetan Buddhists?  Will the new generation of Tibetan Buddhists throw the practice of non-violence to the side and take up arms against the Chinese in order to recapture Tibet?  More things to think about.

I give Rick Ray and his wife a 5 star rating.",1213747200,3,1760,4.705882352941177
2917114,5,B000U788UM,"This video is concerned with the fourteenth Dalai Lama's activities as the political and spiritual leader of a refugee community and advocate for peace, and the historical, political and social context for these activities.

This is an accessible video, providing basic information in a visually engaging manner, and showcasing the Dala Lama's personal charisma, sometimes by showing the Dalai Lama ""in action,"" sometimes through observations from those whose lives he has touched. I'd recommend this video to those interested in any of a number of things -- the situation of the Tibetans; the Dalai Lama's personality, political and social activities and life story; and some of his basic social and political views, in particular, nonviolence.

This film's focus is broader than the title suggests. presenting briefly, but vividly, aspects of life in India, particularly the Himalayan region (entirely consistent with my recollections of time spent in India). Also included are a brief biography of the fourteenth Dalai Lama (including footage of his accepting the Nobel Peace Prize), and some aspects of the situation and character of some Tibetan exile communities, including a small monastery in Ladakh.

These somewhat disparate elements are unified by a first-person narrative that discusses the filmmaker's interests leading to the interview, provides background for the discussion with the Dalai Lama, and then explores themes pertinent to the content of the interview. Like another reviewer, I found some of the observations trite, but the approach works well overall.

The most significant part of the ""ten questions"" for me was the discussion surrounding the Dalai Lama's commitment to nonviolence, and advocacy for peaceful and positive engagement with the Chinese government in a very difficult situation.

The Dalai Lama is an insightful and prolific teacher and philosopher, and there are interesting texts and videos that present in-depth teachings on specific topics. This video seems to be addressed to more general interests.",1208304000,4,2045,5.541666666666667
2917115,2,B000U788UM,"This is billed as a film about the Dalai Lama, but I think he only gets roughly 5 or 10 minutes of its entire length. The rest of the time, the film is being poorly narrorated by its writer/director. It seems as though the questions he wrote were intended more to capture his personal musings on film than to hear the answers of the Dalai Lama. I didn't even find the questions that enlightening. In the end, it seems to be more about the film director than about the Dalai Lama, which is a shame because the latter is such a fascinating human being and the latter, at least by comparison, not so much. It gets two stars for when the Dalai Lama actually does get a chance to speak and for some of the beautiful scenery it depicts. Also has a little information on the history of Tibet, but less than you'd find in five minutes on Wikipedia.",1205798400,9,840,4.289308176100629
2917116,3,B000U788UM,"10 Questions is an entertaining introduction to Tibetan issues, but offers little revelatory to Buddhists or Tibetophiles.

American travel documentary filmmaker Rick Ray manages while shooting a project on India to arrange an interview with the Dalai Lama, a 45-minute meeting which he spins into a two hour documentary on the modern history of Tibet.  Largely ignoring Buddhism, Ray filters political and cultural issues through his romanticized first person account of his three months in northern India.

The parade of cliches begins early on with Ray describing the Tibetans as people whose ""spirit [is] rich beyond imagining.""  He sets off on the ""journey of a lifetime"" to immerse himself in Buddhism and live for a time in a Tibetan monastery.  Along the way he finds that India ""works in mysterious ways"" and that in a monastery in Himachal Pradesh he had ""somehow been transported closer to heaven.""

The viewer is left to wonder, once safely through the platitudes, how Ray was affected by his experience.  Perhaps he wasn't.  Monastery life is little more than a prayer at dawn, a sand mandala, and a joke about butter tea.  Of his Buddhist ""immersion,""  we are presented with only a thumbnail review of  the Buddha's enlightenment.  Of his meeting with the Dalai Lama, he offers no conclusions.  In the end, we are left to wonder why Ray went to such lengths to include so much of himself in the film when he has nothing to say.

Fortunately, the Dalai Lama does, though nothing he hasn't said at other times or other places or in one of his many books.  Still, the wise old man whose laugh sounds a bit like Yoda's is always engaging (even if he isn't making any new points) and literally saves this film from irrelevancy.

Apparently 10 Questions has won a handful of film festival awards, a rather lamentable backhanded compliment to the Tibetans.  Although the awards may attract the attention of those who might not otherwise be interested in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan diaspora, or the occupation of Tibet, that festival judges see this film as worthy of award shows just how little Western audiences still know about these subjects.

First , he sorta takes us through a history of tibet and the finding of the 14th Dalai Lama. The actual interview is at the end of the movie and maybe 15 minutes. The other 70 minutes is a visual feast and excellent soundtrack traveling thru the story of the plight of the Tibetans. Very well done i rented it and watched it 2 or 3  times then i decided to buy it. If yu are a fan of the Dalai Lama this is an excellent archive to possess.

2917120,4,B000U788UM,"The title of this DVD hints that the film's focus is on an interview with HH the DL.  That is not the case.  The major part of the film is a background on the ""Tibet Question"", which is also extremely interesting.

Filmmaker Rick Ray uses what appears to be stock footage of the DL in his youth, meeting with Mao Tzedong, and attempting to negotiate a settlement with the Chinese soon after the Chinese invasion of Tibet.  He also explains both the political and religious significance of the DL's role in Tibetan culture, visits a monastery to see the day-to-day life of Tibetan Buddhist monastics, and films extensive portions of a cultural dance and music festival.

Some of Ray's questions are quite interesting, such as ""why do poor people seem to be happier than rich people""?  He also asks about what the Dalai Lama would recommend as a course of action to help secure peace in the Middle East (the answer: more shared cultural events and festivals).  Sometimes Ray's questions get quite expository as he gives his own ""background"" to how he got the the question to begin with, and you can almost see the DL's eyes starting to glaze over, but generally the interview is quite interesting.  I don't know that I would have chosen the same 10 questions, but that's me.

HH the DL comes across as being a genuinely cheerful and thoughtful person.  His English is heavily accented, and not too good, so the film-maker helps out his viewers by adding English subtitles.  The movie is quite short at 84 minutes, but contains a lot of interesting history and insights into Tibetan culture.",1200355200,3,1588,4.717391304347826

Perhaps I might want to view this one more than once or share it.

It is not the answers to the 10 questions that makes this DVD a ""keeper"". Rather, it is Rick Ray's lively, sometimes colorful, sometimes starkly black-and-white, introduction to the history of the Dalai Lamas, the culture of Tibetan Buddhism and the politics and geography of Tibet, that holds the viewer's attention long before we are introduced to the current Dalai Lama.

The questions that remain for the viewer at the end of the film are as intriguing as the answers we hear. How does one balance nationalism and belief in one's wisdom tradition against love of all humanity and openness to new knowledge? The Dalai Lama provides his view but tempers that with his offering of himself as a limited human, rather than an all-knowing deity.
