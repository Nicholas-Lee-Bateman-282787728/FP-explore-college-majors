1634342,5,B00005NKCR,"Despite the superfluity of attention lavished on THE PRISONER, you get much the best of John Drake and Patrick McGoohan in the original series, DANGER MAN (shown in the US as SECRET AGENT).  Originally written as a spy for NATO, Drake eventually became a British agent in the Bond tradition, but with a decidedly sardonic working-class flavor that meshed neatly with McGoohan's Brooklyn upbringing.
There is something for everyone in the one-hour SECRET AGENT teleplays.  The writing and character-acting (featuring the cream of the British TV troupe of the time) are superb, so that your intellect is diverted regardless of the subject matter.  Although the location budget was limited, the producers managed to convey a genuinely exotic flavor week after week in luminous black-and-white.  Noticeable wisps of LA DOLCE VITA suffuse the wardrobe and coiffure of these swinging-60's episodes.  The music is exquisite, often using a single harpsichord or spare brass and drums to convey a wide range of moods.  And has been noted, Drake takes on assignment after assignment using his own brains and a certain amount of brawn, often under his own name, and often in the face of local (including British) authorities.  Towards the end of the series, when McGoohan's celebrity value had maxed and the limitations of the DANGER MAN formula were evident, a remarkably freewheeling style emerged, one that made THE PRISONER a logical next step or perhaps a reaction.
I have watched these shows for years with fierce affection.  To develop a taste for DANGER MAN is to partake of some of the very best British TV of the 20th century.  Their release on DVD is an occasion of great joy, and I intend to collect everything issued.",1010880000,42,1719,5.024647887323944
1634343,5,B00005NKCR,"For those who were in their teens in the sixties, this set is just like bringing the old memories back. This series was aired by Pakistan Television in the late sixties alongwith hit series like 'The Fugitive','The Man From U.N.C.L.E','Mission Impossible'etc On the particular evening when 'Danger Man' was aired, the town bore a deserted look. Notes were exchanged about the episode the next morning among the viewers. Only if all the episodes of this series are released, will do justice to the old, faithful fans of 'Secret Agent aka Danger Man'",1009324800,4,548,4.967391304347826
1634344,4,B00005NKCR,"Set in the mid-sixties when ""cold war"" activity was intense, ""Danger Man"" presents a ""street level"" view of espionage.  Here there are no grandiose plots by megalomaniacs out to rule the world.  No wild gun battles, secret underground hideouts or pyrotechnic explosions.  Down in the trenches, the action is less spectacular and the objectives are far less ambitious.
Patrick McGoohan as British agent John Drake, is strictly business.  Serious, competent and efficient.  A tightly wound man, without much of a sense of humor, and underneath perhaps a very nasty temper.  McGoohan's short, and clipped manner of speaking adds to the impression of an impatient man with a short fuse.  Fortunately he always finds street parking when reporting for duty at ""World Travel"".
""Danger Man"" is decidedly ""low tech"".  John Drake does not employ any cutting edge, James Bond type gadgets, relying instead on his wits to survive.  No computers, or tricked out vehicles here.  The most ""advanced"" device used, is closed circuit television.  Messages are passed in matchboxes and folded newspapers.  Flashing back on an obsolete technology, how about the microdot?
""Danger Man"" features well developed plots, rather than excessive violence or gunplay, and the body count is low.  In the six episodes, the total number killed personally by Drake is exactly ""00"".  Don't be dissuaded by this, there is still plenty of tension and suspense even without the dramatic fireworks.  The change is refreshing.
Regarding this first ""Danger Man"" collection, the quality of the episodes steadily improves.  Volume 1 opens with ""The Battle of Cameras"", probably the weakest offering in the collection.  McGoohan is not quite convincing, in the role of a suave playboy on the Rivera.  He's no Roger Moore.  This episode features the closest thing to a stereotypical ""cartoon villain"".  The second episode, ""A Room With A View"" is a little better.  With the somewhat over dramatic plot revolving around Drake's efforts to free a captured friend held prisoner in a foreign embassy.  Things start to improve with ""Fair Exchange"", an episode featuring a delusional former agent bent on killing the man who tortured her.  He just happens to be an official in East Germany.  Drake must stop her.
Moving to Volume 2, we find three winners.  In ""Fish On The Hook"", Drake searches for the mysterious ""Fish"", the head of an espionage cell in Egypt, who is in danger of being exposed.  This episode features Zena Marshall who appeared in ""Dr. No"".  Drake plays a butler in ""No Marks for Servility"".  Mervyn Johns is truly obnoxious as Drake's unscrupulous employer.  Here we can plainly see Drake's restrained anger spotlighted.  ""Yesterday's Enemies"" is a fitting finale, the conclusion catches even Drake by surprise, and causes him to question the very authority he serves.  The spy game does have some harsh rules.  Drake barely avoids having his eye used as an ashtray.
Composer Edwin Astley's use of music for ""Danger Man"" is very reminiscent of his work on another series, ""The Saint"".  Though the instances where music used is somewhat reduced, the style is similar, and effective.  The ""Danger Man"" theme is quite energetic and engaging, and the sound of the harpsichord appears with regularity throughout the episodes.  As a bonus, the opening clip of the American incarnation featuring the song ""Secret Agent Man"" by Johnny Rivers, is included.
All in all a very well rounded opening collection.  Hopefully the first of many to come.  ""Danger Man"" is certainly dated, but if you want a more realistic, somewhat ""gritty"" taste of espionage set in those times, this set is highly recommended.  John Drake may not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy, but he gets the job done.  Like A & E's previous collections for ""The Saint"" and the ""The Avengers"" there isn't much in the way of bonus materials.  This is disappointing, but hardly unexpected at this point.
Get this set!",1006214400,28,3940,5.066874027993779
1634345,5,B00005NKCR,"This set of videos was very engaging, and very worthwile.  It was well worth the price.  Our whole family enjoyed watching.  If more ""Secret Agent"" becomes available in the US, I would be very interested.",1003795200,,204,4.771428571428571
1634346,5,B00005NKCR,"The Dangerman series(the 30 min.series)and the Secret Agent series (60 min. each) were and still remain the best of the espionage (films and TV) series ever made (to my knowledge, anyway). I thought that present day viewers would never be able to appreciate these videos, because for some strange reason they have not been  rerun for years in the US. And then when Columbia Video got a hold on them they were buried away in their vaults to be forever forgotten. Well, all I can say is hooray for A&E (the reissuing company)! And let's hope that they will also reissue the rest of the series (some 40+ altogether, as I remember) and the 30 min Dangerman videos as well.",1003536000,,668,4.566666666666666
1634347,5,B00005NKCR,"While most DVD televiewers were first exposed to Patrick McGoohan's magnetic personality with the excellent TV series ""The Prisoner"", most fail to realize that before it, McGoohan played in this enjoyably realistic espionage series in which McGoohan excels as the dry, cynical agent John drake. The true Bond precursor, the series brought you in a totally different ""spying"" environment each week, with various fascinating situations in thoroughly more credible fashion than the unavoidable Ian Flemming's cinematographic derivatives. I found that ""Secret Agent/Danger Man"" has stood the test of time extremely well among cult TV series. Intelligent scripts and superbly cool British actors. There are many more episodes in this long-lived series, all of which I am eagerly waiting to acquire as soon as they come out! - I secretly relish the vision of this whole series on DVD on my shelf! - An absolute must for all Sixties'TV fans!",1003536000,3,934,5.275167785234899
1634348,5,B00005NKCR,"I've always loved Patrick McGoohan's work, from the time I crawled into bed with my parents as a child to watch The Prisoner to recently buying Escape From Alcatraz on DVD. So I had high hopes for this series, which I'd heard about both directly and through references, such as in  Dangermouse.
I wasn't disappointed.  The writing is clever, and the hero is the no-nonsense, wryly cynical sort of man you'd expect in the position of an intelligence operative.  While his adventures might not be parallel to what intelligence operatives actually experience, they are certainly believable in that they don't rely upon fantastic gadgets, wacky strained plot devices, or really anything other than intelligent analysis and shrewd execution.
I was very happy with these DVDs, and I hope the entire series (or rather, all of this and the other two series, for you Brits) comes out on DVD soon.
Todd Bob sez check it out.",1003104000,5,914,4.883870967741935
1634349,5,B00005NKCR,"OK, go ahead, tell me I'm wrong, but point out a better series. No cheap thrills through pyrotechnics, smut and inuendo. Just solid writing, good story lines, excellent and real character development. John Drake was THE man of the 60's. I would hold up Saturday night dates until Secret Agent was over - never regretted it.
Colorize this series and run it on Fox and they would have another hit. Sure it's dated and the sets are pretty retro, but the style is fast-paced and the creators didn't waste time trying to save the world, just making one case at a time.
I always regretted that this series did not last longer. Is it too much to ask for someone to wise up and bring it back? Not nostalgia, just sick of current TV fare. This is what TV should be.",1002585600,9,756,4.368794326241135
1634350,5,B00005NKCR,"I have waited for years for someone to release this series on tape and DVD!
Leave the fancy, posh-sounding reviews to the folks in the paper!  This collection of episodes shows John Drake at his best, and is just plain FUN to watch.
What's even better is that this show is not like the sex-and-violence-with-too-many-special-effects filed junk currently on the TV and at the movies. It's also relieving to see someone take care of business just by using his wits.

I loved watching them as a kid and I like them even more now. You can bet that I will be among the first in line to get subsequent releases!",1001894400,4,605,4.490909090909091

7947317,5,B00005NKCR,"It was a joy to watch John Drake in action once again, after 50 or more years, and recapture the pleasure of viewing one of my first TV fictional secret agents to be serialized. I watched this program faithfully from its first season on U.S. TV to the very end - also followed actor Patrick McGoohan through his entire performance as ""The Prisoner,"" which showed off my very first favorite actor as a skilled storyliner and writer.",1173312000,,431,4.6103896103896105
7947318,5,B00005NKCR,"Patrick McGoohan stars as British agent John Drake in this little-known but wonderful series from English TV. The show initially ran in the early 1960s, and can really be seen as a precursor to ""The Prisoner,"" with some fans insisting that Drake actually is Number Six from the later series. I have been a fan of ""The Prisoner"" for years, but have only recently seen this earlier series, and honestly it took me a couple of episodes to really warm to it. Now that I have watched it, though, I am delighted to have it in my collection.

The stories are imaginative, if a bit more predictable than ""The Prisoner,"" are extremely well acted, and are thoroughly absorbing. I have always found McGoohan to be a fascinating and convincing actor, and here he certainly does not disappoint. As Drake I believe that he is infinitely more suave than any James Bond from the big screen, appearing clever, inventive, and supremely in control.

Though the series is in black and white, the print and sound are both excellent. (The shows are so engrossing as to forget any technical shortcomings, anyway.) This is the height of cold war espionage adventure, and anyone who loves that era, complex drama, or ""The Prisoner"" will love this as well. I highly recommend this DVD set and series.",1122076800,3,1274,4.7342342342342345
7947319,5,B00005NKCR,"... I'm the proud owner of set1 of this video which keeps
me glued to the telly whenever the video is played. The theme
music is thrilling and sets the pace for a fast paced episode.
Patrick Mcgoohan aptly fits into the title role. I could only wish
that the full 48 episodes are published and the danger man fans
have a larger collection to play over and over rather than risking damage to their cherished single set.",1018137600,4,418,4.371794871794871
7947320,4,B00005NKCR,"When I first heard the theme it immediately brought back memories of watching this the first time as a relatively young child.  I refer to the original theme of Danger Man - I saw these in the UK - not the truly terrible ""Secret Agent Man"" song that is given as a ""bonus"".
I was concerned that they would not stand the test of time but was pleasantly surpised.  A little dated in places, they still show what good plots and great acting can produce with an obviously limited budget.  They do require a certain amount of attention and mental effort by the viewer but I think that's a plus not a negative.  The fact that my college age kids watch them and think they are pretty good is a tribute to their quality.
These truly represent a time when British commercial televsion was producing top quality programs.  Highly recommended.",1015632000,3,831,4.513333333333334
