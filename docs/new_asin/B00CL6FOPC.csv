My biggest gripe was lack of subtitles. However this set was the best pricing and easy to watch.",1495324800,,208,4.648648648648648
8582977,3,B00CL6FOPC,"Unfortunately I was not able to play this with my Samsung player (regional a, United States player) because the movies are made for region B  but it played fine with my multiregional Philip Blu-ray player. It is crystal clear but without subtitles. Another strange thing was I got two copies of disc number one. Anyway, I am happy to say that the return policy was generous and I was able to get my credit almost immediately after I dropped it off at a 7-Eleven drop box.",1478131200,,471,4.476744186046512
8582978,5,B00CL6FOPC,"For the record, Series 6 has yet to be released on Blu-ray in Spain and likely never will be, so this is the most complete set you can purchase on Blu-ray. That having been said, there are issues to be aware of. First, while this is not available on Blu-ray anywhere else in the world, it is available digitally. Second, the quality is wonderful for a budget release with vibrant colors and true blacks (none of that gray nonsense we see from echo bridge, among other companies nowadays) but the detail is not always what you will be used to if you are, like me, a Blu fanatic, so don't expect the finest detail in the background. The picture here is in keeping with, as an example, Grantchester on Blu-ray. Third, while this is not slowed down in transition (thank goodness) it was not changed from 25fps to 24fps for seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5 so certain A players won't be able to view the discs even though they are, officially, region free. Series one was 24fps as native format so it is viewable on all players. Series 2, 3, 4 and 5 required a region free player in our home as we have Sony players which cannot convert 25fps to 24fps for output to an NTSC television. All that having been said, we have all of these and absolutely love them. You can't beat high definition for viewing pleasure when you are looking at quaint English homes and gardens and the sound quality on the discs is quite good, though not master quality. To reference the DVD set we had of series one, the sound was slightly better on the Blu-ray. We did not have DVDs of 2, 3, 4 and 5 to compare but the encoding was the same so it is most likely also slightly better than on the NTSC DVD releases. For series 6, we got the UK PAL DVD release which is quite good, for DVD but would still love to see  Llamentol do a release on it and would purchase it if they did. For the record, of course, you must select English or the Spanish language track will play. Again, these Blu-rays are wonderful and well worth importing if you can view them. Good luck.",1457740800,5,2026,4.289817232375979
