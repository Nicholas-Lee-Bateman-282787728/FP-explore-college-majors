4214172,5,B003WL42ZI,"Let me just say that I've been watching Tara Stiles on YouTube for the past couple of years, and I love her and her style of teaching.  So it's no surprise that I'd love this DVD.  As far as my yoga practice goes, it's been pretty off and on, always lacking consistency.  So I still consider myself a beginner.  For beginners, this DVD is tough.  I had almost zero upper body strength, so even plank pose was a challenge.  But Tara does show you some modifications that made it doable for me, such as the side plank.  If I hadn't been able to keep my knee down in the beginning, there's no way I'd have been able to do this video. Also, Tara's also good about reminding you to start where you are and don't feel bad about it.

I couldn't do the entire DVD at first.  I started with 15 minutes and worked my way up.  It's the only workout DVD that I look forward to doing!  And if anyone is reading this and maybe thinking that they aren't in good enough shape to try this, just do it and start slow.  You'll build strength pretty quickly.  This DVD is a good workout.  You will sweat and your heart will pump!  I think she has kept her promise that yoga can be a good cardiovascular exercise.  I'm still nowhere near as graceful and strong as I want to be, but for the first time I'm enjoying sticking with it.  I know I'll get there.

As far as the music, I honestly never even notice it until maybe the seated poses, and it's fine.  I have no trouble hearing her over it.

I'd recommend buying this DVD if you like unpretentious, challenging yoga with a great teacher.  Just be aware beforehand that beginners lacking upper body strength will have to modify a bit at first.",1285718400,6,1675,4.253968253968254
4214173,5,B003WL42ZI,I bought this on spec because I've watched a few of Tara's online videos. The DVD will not disappoint. Tara makes yoga very accessible. The best thing about this DVD is that the one routine (60 mins) can be used at all levels. For each pose Tara starts at the beginner level and then quickly shows what you could also do with the pose (intermediate and advanced variations). I have never seen this aspect (pose variations) done as well (and I own a lot of yoga DVDs).,1284768000,4,467,4.379310344827586
4214174,2,B003WL42ZI,"I don't understand the high reviews, which gave me high hopes for this dvd.  I own over 50 yoga dvds and am always looking for something interesting to add to the rotation, but this was a disappointment.

Perhaps my first clue should have been when I opened the box and was greeted by Ms. Stile's come-hither look on the dvd's cover picture.  And then, there was the quote chosen for the cover: ""Tara's got to be the coolest yoga instructor ever,"" (Vanity Fair).  Oh, dear.  Seems rather un-yoga, to care about looking sexy and being ""the coolest.""

Still, I gave the ""hour"" practice a shot.  Although there are some interesting balancing sequences, the poorly chosen music and/or sound mix prevents her voice from being clearly heard.  Also of no help in that matter is the fact that she wears her long hair down for the entire practice, and it -- surprise! --  keeps getting in her face.  Yo, yogini:  use a hairband.  Pony tail.  Something.  She makes many references to having to adjust her hair.  I want an instructor who cares more about clearly communicating form and sequence than needing to flip back her flowing tresses.  She also made more than one reference to yet another distraction: needing to adjust (ahem) her shorts, which are teeny, teeny, and did I mention teeny?  Acceptable working attire for a roller derby queen or lap dancer but not practical for a serious yoga instructor, who's lifting her leg way up high and...oh, where are those little bits of spandex creeping? What's the sanskrit term:  Wedgie-asana?

Save your $$. Namaste.",1284336000,45,1556,4.7819548872180455
4214175,5,B003WL42ZI,"I have not done yoga in awhile, so starting off with Tara is great.  Something to workup too.  My body feels alive again.  Love it!",1284163200,4,131,4.16
4214176,4,B003WL42ZI,"Overall, LOVE, LOVE this dvd -- great addition to my yoga practice. I thought it might be easier to lay out positives & negatives below.

Positives:
*I think the dvd gets incrementally better each time I do it. The first time I did it, I was on the fence about it...the second time, liked it better...now after the 6th time, I can't wait to get back to it. There's something very addicting about it.
*Stretching section is one of the better ones I've done (as an owner of ~20 different yoga dvds) -- hamstrings feel amazing afterwards.
*Love all the different splits intertwined -- you feel so long & stretched afterwards.
*Music is fun (in my opinion) - not super chanty/""om""-like
*Challenging, but not overly...blends strength-building with stretching enough so you're getting a workout, but you're still breathing deeply & feeling relaxed.
*Tara has a GREAT energy about her; she makes yoga very accessible to people like me who aren't pros.

Negatives:
*the ""1-hour"" session is really ~50 minutes...not to be a nudge...but if you're neurotic like me and like doing ""a full hour"" workout, you'll notice.
*I prefer more emphasis on the breath-linking as I work through movements; sometimes I'm running through different poses and not sure if I'm supposed to be breathing in or breathing out. Probably more my issue, as I've only been doing yoga for <5 years.
*the ""1-hour"" session doesn't feature anything crazy different from poses you've seen before, but with that said, the sequence she runs through is phenomenal.

Overall, positives DEFINITELY outweigh the negatives!",1284076800,13,1574,5.022988505747127
4214177,4,B003WL42ZI,"The hour long, in-studio session on this DVD is excellent -demanding but without crazy, circus-type stunts. It is comparable to the Sadie Nardini DVDs I've tried. The only drawback in my opinion is the monotone, sometimes mumbling instruction that at times gets drowned out by the music (perhaps recording the instruction separately would've helped). I found the additional sessions filmed throughout the city peculiar. They lack instruction and aren't filmed in a way that makes following along very easy. They are artfully edited and show off Tara's skill but these qualities are likely of secondary concern to most shopping for yoga DVDs. These are minor quibbles though and the hour long session alone makes this a worthy investment for anyone looking for a challenging yoga DVD that will leave you sweating.",1283990400,5,812,5.206106870229007
4214178,3,B003WL42ZI,"*Updated Review*
I've owned this DVD for a while. There are good & bad things about it.
Good- The routine is challenging & great for people trying to improve or advance their practice; Tara is great at instruction: I find I do not need to look at the screen to figure out what she is telling to do.

Neutral - The routine is OK. There's not much time for rest or easing into poses as I find this DVD for the advanced. I say I am intermediate. I do not feel at ease doing this routine. In fact, I feel more stressed out during & relieved after!

Bad- The music choices are terrible. I have no idea what they were thinking!; the sound editing is not mixed very well and sometimes I have to struggle to hear her over the music; her voice can muffle at times; the bonus routines do not have instruction and are ""over-edited"" with flashy colors and all. Not sure what that's about :P

The biggest problem with this DVD is the lack of quality.
Since her second DVD came out, I do not use this one anymore. I tried to go back to it, but the quality is lacking.
Tara is fantastic & this DVD does not show case her at all.",1282953600,,1113,4.119815668202765
4214179,5,B003WL42ZI,"Tara knocks it out of the park when it comes to explaining and teaching yoga in a way that is helpful to Everyone.  This video is equally good as an introduction to yoga (she moves slowly enough that you can follow along in your own way, and the moves are all pretty straightforward), as well as something that will keep you challenged for a long time to come (you can always do more and go further).  While it's great if you can make it to class, this is the perfect DVD to keep you going during road trips or if you can't make it to NYC.",1281657600,7,539,4.0754716981132075
4214180,5,B003WL42ZI,"Tara Stiles has officially transformed me into a Yoga addict! Prior to buying this DVD I had begun to practice basic yoga poses; I have been practicing yoga, along side Stiles, for approximately four to five weeks. The results of yoga have impacted multiple areas of my life: I have increased in flexibility, strength and stamina; breathe control has improved, along with stress management; prior skin issues, mainly adult acne have seriously subsided, and my skin has obtained a more ""youthful glow;"" and yoga has made me more mindful of diet and nutrition. My only advice to others, especially beginners, is to realize that your body has limits and will eventually gain the strength, flexibility, balance and openness to do forearm stands and standing splits (that is just to name a few- Tara makes it look so easy that it may be discouraging to some).

 I honestly love Tara Stiles and cannot get enough of her now! I can't wait till her book ""Slim, Calm, Sexy- Yoga"" is released at the end of the month!! More reviews will follow!",1281571200,7,1034,4.770949720670391
4214181,5,B003WL42ZI,"Heres the basic info ""Yoga Anywhere The New York Sessions features a flawlessly carved out 60 minutes of intense calorie burning yoga, with Tara showing you the basics, then guiding you through more advanced moves with her precise form and expert instruction. Plus 4 bonus routines that can only be described as yoga art. Hip, stylized scenes set to rock music, with Tara performing the most inventive poses, in the most unexpected places. From the tunnels in Central Park to the famous FlatIron Building on Fifth Ave., the intent is to inspire the practice of yoga anywhere; you have to see to believe!""

I found this DVD to very advanced and I have been doing yoga Ashtanga and Kundalini Yoga for over 10 years. Being a NY native I really enjoyed seeing all the landmarks. Very entertaining. Different from the usual forest or ocean backdrop you get in most dvds.",1281312000,29,865,4.766666666666667
4214182,2,B003WL42ZI,"I purchased one other dvd of hers and loved it.  This one is a little out there.  If you are super experienced and want to be awesome at yoga this is a good dvd.  If you're just looking to stretch, not a good choice.  Pretty difficult moves.",1355529600,,241,4.0638297872340425
4214183,4,B003WL42ZI,"I've only used this DVD once and the reason I bought it is because I'm a fan of Tara's books. This DVD contains a one hour yoga session filmed in-door and 5 ten minutes sessions of Tara doing yoga in different places of NYC. The one hour session is very difficult for me considering I have a fairly WEAK upper body. I did stop a few times as I couldn't follow along but I tried my best and hope one day I'd get there. The music is fine, not annoying at all and also not so soothing to put me to sleep. The 5 ten minutes sessions are just like everyone else said, but for a New Yorker like me, I find it somewhat inspiring. They did get me thinking although I might not be able to do what Tara did there, at least I could work on my breath or do short meditations there, or anywhere else. Some reviewer complained about Tara's outfits and hair. Her Outfits are fine, comfortable and easy to move in them. Many people go to yoga classes in these outfits. As for her hair, I don't see any problem with that, it's not like I couldn't see her movements because of it or something. The only reason I give this DVD four star is because Tara sometimes talks very fast, resulting in unclear instruction and force you to look up the screen. This is a problem not only with this DVD, but with all her youtube videos.",1342224000,,1305,4.16205533596838
4214184,5,B003WL42ZI,I have Tara Stiles' book and was curious to try her workout dvd.  I love it! It is a great workout and it's so relaxing! I would recommend this to any level of yoga-doer.,1341792000,,170,4.0
4214185,1,B003WL42ZI,"I am an avid tara stiles follower.  I love her videos on youtube, so i bought this dvd.  The one hour of yoga instruction is very good, i think.  The huge disappointment followed when i realized all of the NYC stuff is actually just her showing off for about 5 hours of footage that is not beneficial at all to the person who paid money to own this DVD.  Yeah, of course you look great Tara Stiles, but that is not helping anyone here.  We can not follow along your routines, there is no instruction. I searched for some kind of instruction audio feature, there is none.  Just tons and tons of minutes of useless selfish yoga in NYC.  unfortunate.  I would like my money back.",1341187200,5,676,4.309523809523809
4214186,4,B003WL42ZI,"I enjoyed Tara Stiles's Yoga Anywhere.  Although on the cover of the video it says the workout is two hours.  That is very misleading. The main session is about 52 minutes.  Then it has four different ten minute sessions showing Tara doing yoga in different places.

If you want to get the most out of this workout just do the 52 minute main section.  I didn't think the music was annoying at all.  I was suprised at all the negative reviews.  She went slowly through most of the yoga postures and then did a few challenging postures that I modified.

I did not like the four ten minute sessions, which is why I'm giving it four stars.  The ten minute sessions are set to loud music and she does not instruct at all.  It's just her showing off some yoga moves.  I would buy this dvd for the 52 minute session.  I was suprised at the amount of sweating I did.  She does give a lot of instructions in the main session.  The ten minute sessions were hard to follow.

I did not think her clothes were too tight or revealing.  I have seen her on her utube videos with her hair in a pony tail.  She is a great instructor.  I think a lot of people may hate her because she's a beautiful young lady with a successful business.  She's got beautiful hair and she was not messing with it doing the video.  Either that or I was too busy doing the postures to care about what she was doing with her hair.  On her website she also talks about eating clean etc.  Yoginis may also be mad because at the end of the session we didn't do any kind of meditation.  That's fine with me.  I'm just trying to get more flexible.  If I want to relax a few minutes I can lay down on my mat once the session is over and work on my breathing.  I think this dvd would be great for weight loss benefits.  When I do yoga dvds I don't normally sweat.  I sweated with her workout.  I hope this helps.",1337472000,6,1866,4.134078212290503
4214187,1,B003WL42ZI,"Wow, I sure was disappointed in this DVD!  Let me count the ways:

#1 with a bullet - the music...sorry, but hip hop music and yoga Don't Mix!  I don't want to hear a singer going ""Yo, yo"" while I'm in downward dog, ok?  I mean, at least provide a music off option for those not hip enough to enjoy the music.

#2 - the hair...what's up with that?  It's called a scrunchie!  Oops, I'm sorry, scrunchies are out!  How about a headband or a couple of barrettes?  If you MUST wear it loose, at least stop mentioning it every 2 minutes.

#3 - the outfit....short shorts, a tank top, and leg warmers?  Is this the 70's and you are going out to roller skate after your yoga session?  Do I really need to see that much of your butt cheeks peaking out of your short shorts?

It's such a shame because Tara really is a decent yoga instructor.  I quite enjoy her Daily Yoga workout with Team Fonda and was hoping for more YOGA, less LOOK AT HOW COOL I AM.

I'm just going to try and forget this DVD was ever created....still trying to be interested in the Deepak ones coming out late 2011 (and the rumored rooftop yoga workouts early 2012) but this one is making it hard to be enthusiastic!",1318636800,7,1180,4.205357142857143
4214188,1,B003WL42ZI,"If you like to rush your yoga and do it solely to admire yourself in a narcissistic way, Tara Stiles style yoga is for you.  First, just go to her website and the first thing you see are photos of Tara posing provocatively in a nude colored body suit, on a couch with her ass in the air, like she's ready to be taken doggie style.  That's poser yoga.  Secondly, she rushes through everything and there's no time to get a real stretch.  Thirdly, on the DVD cover, she's posing with incorrect alignment (hips are optimally squared, not open to the side).  Again, to better view her long hair? So which is more important?  Proper alignment or a shot of Tara's hair? It feels like something a teenager might produce and market.... Look at my hair.... Bad sign.

Sorry, but with so many really GOOD yoga DVDs out there and so many good teachers, this model who's so into herself instead of the art of the yoga practice is not necessary.  And how did she get Deepak Chopra's endorsement?  That really says a lot about endorsements these days... they're pretty much worthless.",1308528000,10,1069,4.526041666666667
4214189,4,B003WL42ZI,"I wondered quite some time if I should order this dvd or not, considering the reviews. There are 2parts: one hour session which I really enjoyed, and then there are the 5small ""practices"" where Tara Stiles practices in different places of N.Y, but those 5 are not instructed at all. A little disappointing beceause I expected instructions; that being said, I like the idea, meaning you can really practice anywhere, and ok, you're not going to suddenly stop walking in the streets and get into utkatasana, but you can practice the breating exercises, letting go etc. And you can practice an early sunday morning in a parck ;) I had fun trying to follow her in the first two small practices, and I'm going to try the others in the next few days... Also, her yoga is ""non-tradditional"", but it's something I like from time to time! :)",1304294400,3,832,4.628378378378378
4214190,4,B003WL42ZI,"I enjoyed the 1 hour yoga session it is commentated very well and is a great yoga routine, but the shorter 4 x ten minute sessions have no commentary therefore make the practice very difficult to do as you must watch the DVD the whole time through the practice (not so good).",1301097600,,275,4.3076923076923075
4214191,1,B003WL42ZI,"After following Tara on Facebook on Youtube I was excited for this DVD.  I am high beginner to intermediate and this is too confusing and difficult to follow along with.  The setting is distracting, you can't understand her, there's really no instruction. Did I miss something?!  I'm sure she is a great yoga instructor (she has a huge following!) but this DVD was perhaps a concept that needs more work.  I will still try out her Jane Fonda Yoga Video and hope that's better suited for me! But my honest recommendation is:  If you are a beginner to intermediate student wanting a CD that you can really learn from you should pass on this DVD.  If you are a Tara Fan it could be a nice addition to your collection but I don't see it getting much use.",1300147200,13,750,4.398550724637682
4214192,1,B003WL42ZI,"This was the most rediculous yoga dvd i have ever purchased. I can't even believe they sell these.

So when I got this DVD, I thought only great things would come of it. Unfortunately not. While Tara is awesome and truly knows her yoga, the DVD is far from an instructional tool. It can serve great as yoga entertainment, as yoga art indeed, but not as a DVD to help you with your yoga practice or to even be able to easily follow along or would even want to.",1296777600,12,519,4.2
4214196,2,B003WL42ZI,"it's a great workout, not a yoga practice. yes she looks great, yes she can deliver the moves and the poses, but in reality her practice is too americanized, not real yoga. this is exercise-yoga not true yoga. fast moves, fast talking just like her you tube videos- she's far from a yoga master or expert. those who call her that don't know anything about yoga. definitely not for beginers - good for those in the exercise scene or those yogis & yoginis that want to supplement their traditional yoga practices and use yoga as exercise. it is just what new-yorkers and big city dwellers like- fast pace, stressful workout to go with their lifestyles. however, that is truly what new-yorkers don't need. this is what sedentary and overweight people need. new-yorkers need real yoga, tai chi and qi gong. otherwise, they are shortening their lives. her book has a lot of good info. on yoga, but then again, there are many other great yoga books out there. nonetheless, if you want to exercise in yogic-style way, this is for you.",1296000000,8,1027,4.679558011049724
4214197,4,B003WL42ZI,"I have only used the DVD twice (2 days in a row) and I am feeling happy and energetic,already. I am not new to yoga. I have been on yoga for the past 3 years, of which 2 years I practiced consistently everyday and the last 10months or so, been behaving like a lazy bum and only practicing in class once a week. So it was no surprise that on my first attempt at this DVD, I was really struggling my way through but today (my second attempt) was a bit easier. And mind you, I had a wonderful sleep last night. I was actually smiling to sleep. I felt happy all over and I am sure it is because of the workout. I can see myself getting better with this DVD. And I am sure I will grab any other DVDs by Tara Stiles if she is ever planning to make another :)
You may wonder why I rated it as only 4, that's because, I really couldn't follow her instructions clearly, as her voice was a bit soft. (That could also be the reason why I was struggling through the first attempt). But what I did was, i sat through the DVD and watched without following the workout and managed to catch up the second time.

And also I was bit disappointed with the packaging as it came in a bad shape. The DVD cover was cracked and the DVD had a scratch on it. So I wasn't sure if I got a new copy (though I ordered a new one). I know I shouldn't be writing it here, but I don't know where else I could raise this issue. Kindly take note.

Stiles starts the video by saying something along the lines of #this is good if you are a beginner..."" Believe me when I say that is not true! She is so fast and she is mumbling. I couldn't follow one move and I barley heard what she was saying when I was doing my downward dog. Also, the background music is stressing and annoying.

Firstly it is so distracing with the noise and the movement and most importantly are you supposed to follow along? There is no instruction at all! This is a dvd of Tara Stiles showing off her yoga poses! Very decieiving unless it should have been titled Tara Stiles doing her yoga for herself. Maybe she should watch shiva Rea or some of the other qualified teacher to see how you teach yoga on a dvd rather than just showing off the poses.

The workouts in this dvd were so fast and advanced that it was actually unmotivating. Half the time her hair is hanging in her face to it's hard to see/hear exactly what's going on. She breezes through poses so quickly there's no way I could keep up. My boyfriend couldn't keep up either and he has far more yoga experience than I do. The pulsing color changes made us dizzy and gave me a headache. This dvd is back in its case and at the bottom of the stack. Not sure I'll ever view it again.,1286582400,62,644,4.286885245901639

8407389,5,B003WL42ZI,"Never mind about envious reviews. This is a completely awsome, STRONG and challenging 60' yoga class, with the most clear instructions that I've ever watched in Tara Stiles' videos. She guides you through the poses almost patiently, with less chatting than usual, and better shape in preparations and poses. Of course, you should know it would be a journey to complete the sequence only by breathing deeply and moving with ease... It would take time, sweat, balance, strenght and so on. This dvd is going to be your yoga companion for several months, before you can achieve a graceful performance (or even finish it with some pride). By then, your entire body would be more strong and flexible than ever. And you surely would sweat some pounds off. NOW: Some reviews complain about the bonuses: the music is so loud, the clothes are not proper, instructions are not given, Tara is just showing off yoga poses... I think the bonuses are beautiful. They show you how much you can achieve by learning from the class. The incredible freedom of yoga, the art of developing such graceful balance, and be FREE to express it ANYWHERE with ease. I found the bonuses very inspiring. You can see the development of the poses far beyond the class, not for ""showing off"", but for YOUR motivation. For you to find your own Yoga, ANYWHERE you are.",1389571200,2,1332,4.745689655172414

8407391,5,B003WL42ZI,"I love Tara Stiles and was really excited to get this DVD. It doesn't disappoint. I agree that it is not for beginners, but that is ok. I really like how out of the box it is. It has a completely different feel and great music. I don't feel it is her showing off poses as some reviews said, at all. It is a very devoted yogi sharing her practice with us in a beautiful format. I like the different settings and the choices you have for practices. Maybe just watch them through once to get a feel for them. I am really happy to have added this to my collection, and would definitely recommend it!",1375315200,,595,4.137931034482759
8407392,3,B003WL42ZI,"No, this is not a DVD for beginners. Tara's instruction style is too sparse, and the strength/flexibility required for the hour-long yoga session is unrealistic to expect of a beginner, unless they are a dancer. However, I enjoyed the hour-long session quite a bit. I teach yoga, and even I was a bit confused by her mumbling. But her sequences are actually really brilliant, and I had a lot of fun doing this DVD, even if I had to look up at the screen more often than was ideal.

Yes, her New York Sessions are more art than yoga instruction. I wouldn't buy this DVD with the expectation that you will get more than one yoga workout from it. Yes, Tara Stiles teaches in booty shorts, so if you are a yoga purist, this DVD is going to drive you crazy. But this DVD does incorporate the important element of breath work, and the flow is much more elegant than yoga DVD's taught by overall fitness instructors, so don't count Tara Stiles out. Also, if you found her youtube videos too fast, the pace of this DVD is a little slower. She still breezes through poses like pigeon a little too quickly for my taste, but I just pause the video for a few extra breaths. I think this DVD is a perfect addition to the collection of an experienced practitioner who enjoys power yoga, and isn't going to be bothered by an instructor who is wearing clothing that wouldn't be out of place at a strip club.",1371513600,,1391,4.391472868217054
