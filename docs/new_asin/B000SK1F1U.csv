8205613,5,B000SK1F1U,"If you are a fan of Hawaiian music and find this anywhere, GRAB IT!  It is doubtful that this rare performance will ever be re-released. This performance pre-dates DVD and is available only on VHS. The soundtrack is linear mono but still quite good. If you are a fan of the Makaha Sons of Ni'ihau, this will be a total immersion experience.",1369440000,,340,4.483870967741935
