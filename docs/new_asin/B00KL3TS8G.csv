8659661,5,B00KL3TS8G,"The Cato Isaksen Mysteries is a superb television series from Nordisk Film, which was adapted from the detective novels of the international best-selling Norwegian crime author Unni Lindell. This series is essentially a combination of a detective procedural and a family drama, and it is presented in its original Norwegian language format, with English subtitles. This second season continues the story line centering around Cato Isaksen, a tired and troubled veteran Norwegian homicide detective, whose personal life is completely dysfunctional, and who seems to be suffering from elements of both severe job stress and generalized burnout. Cato Isaksen has a longstanding history of trouble with interpersonal communication, turbulent relationships with the women in his life, and difficulty making time for his children and being an involved father. Although Cato Isaksen usually looks scruffy, disheveled, and distracted, and often displays an extremely volatile demeanor, his unkempt appearance and his obvious emotional distress belie his exceptional investigative skills and acumen. When he is not distracted by his chaotic personal life, and he is able to focus, Cato Isaksen is a masterful detective, who is extremely intuitive, methodical, and persistent, with an uncanny ability to solve complicated homicide cases. The Cato Isaksen Mysteries is a superb detective procedural, which is characterized by excellent writing and plot development, with murder mysteries that are intriguing, gripping, and suspenseful, replete with many interesting twists. Reidar Sorensen delivers an outstanding performance with his brilliant portrayal of Detective Cato Isaksen, and the acting performances of the supporting cast are also stellar. The Cato Isaksen Mysteries is a decidedly intelligent, engaging, and entertaining Norwegian detective series from Nordisk Film, which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1507420800,2,1943,5.942857142857143
8659662,5,B00KL3TS8G,"Great series, rich atmosphere, dialogue well done, characters interact in changing complex ways instead of simplistic ones.  Nice music, beautifully photographed.  Only flaw...the almost universal fixation on gruesome depiction and violence against women.  Even so...where is season 3?",1496793600,,285,6.447368421052632
