6426868,5,B00KH57UPG,"Your favorite paranoid pooch who desperately needs an oral surgeon is back in a brand-new 2-disc DVD set !  Join Courage as well as his owners Muriel and Eustace as they take part in 13 more frightening adventures such as:

""The Magic Tree of Nowhere"" - A tree grows in front of Courage's farmhouse and it has the ability to grant wishes, but Eustace is determined to cut it down because it's getting more attention than him.

""Robot Randy"" - A robot named Randy proves he's not a failure by enslaving Courage, Muriel, and Eustace.  However, he soon realizes that there's more to life than just conquering planets.

""Family Business"" - An absent-minded burglar mistakes Muriel, Eustace, and Courage for his own family and suddenly enlists them in a plot to pull a heist.

""1000 Years of Courage"" - A meteor hits Earth spiraling it to the year 3001.  When Courage goes out to investigate, he discovers the planet is inhabited by banana people.

""Courage Meets the Mummy"" - A centuries-old mummy seeks revenge on an ancient Mayan queen and pooh-bah who strikingly resemble Muriel and Eustace.

""Invisible Muriel"" - Courage unearths a strange gem and gives it to Muriel.  Little do they know is that gem is actually a secret government invisibility stone, and Muriel is captured by said government for it.

""Courage the Fly"" - Courage gets turned into a fly, and that's not the half of it.  A satellite is hurtling towards the farmhouse and only Courage with his newfound size can be able to fly up there and stop it.

""Katz Kandy"" - Sick and tired of being second to Muriel, the felonious Katz concocts a mutant jam to kidnap her and Courage.

""Mega Muriel the Magnificent"" - To show Courage what true bravery is all about, his computer downloads itself into Muriel's body turning her into a daredevil.

""Bad Hair Day"" - Muriel has been taken to a secret institute on account of her rare blood type that can restore hair growth.

""Car Broke. Phone. Yes?"" - A mysterious stranger stops by the farmhouse to use the phone, but he turns out to be an alien set out to steal Muriel's kindness !

""Cowboy Courage"" - Courage drifts off to sleep and dreams he's the Wild West hero of a bedtime story Muriel tells him.

""The House of Discontent"" - The spirit of the Harvest Moon tells Eustace he should prove his worth of being a farmer or suffer the consequences.  Knowing how stubborn Eustace is, Courage steps in to set things right.

""The Tower of Dr. Zalost"" - An evil scientist and his moving tower shoot cannonballs all over Nowhere making them - Muriel included - depressed and unhappy.  Courage must find a cure for this epidemic by infiltrating that tower.

Some skeptics say that all those weird creatures and villains are all hallucinations in Courage's canine cranium, but I somehow doubt that theory despite the fact that dog went through early abandonment.  Still, he sure does his best to be a hero in the best way possible, so don't call that dog off as stupid.  So this is great to see a classic Cartoon Network series get a new season set, and I sure hope more are in development like season two of ""Johnny Bravo"" or ""Dexter's Laboratory"" or even a season one set for ""Cow and Chicken"" or ""Camp Lazlo"" or any other hit series that need a DVD set.  Let's hope it does happen.",1413763200,9,3281,4.586620926243568

6426893,5,B00KH57UPG,"Back in the late 90s/early 2000's, Cartoon Network was at an all time high; hitting one home run after the next with their list of cartoons, including ""Powerpuff Girls"", ""Dexter's Lab"", ""Ed, Edd, n' Eddy"", and many others. But out of all their benchmark shows, the weirdest one out of the pack was, no question, ""Courage the Cowardly Dog."" Taking place in the fictional town of Nowhere, Kansas, the series was about a dog named Courage, who lived on a farm with his two owners; a kindly old woman named Muriel, and her grumpy husband, Eustace. Unfortunately for the tiny family, their farm seems to constantly be a magnet for trouble of all kinds, including monsters, magic, aliens, and other worldly happenings. So in spite of being terrified all the time, Courage must always summon his bravery to save his family and his home--often with both creepy and hilarious results. (Because remember folks, 'courage' doesn't mean you're not scared--it's doing what you have to, despite being afraid.)

Simply put, this was a horror show for kids, with a wide range of stories with unconventional heroes and villains. You never quite knew what you were in for, be it something cute, funny, or outright disturbing. Although you always knew Courage would save the day, you never quite knew HOW he was going to do it, making each episode filled with constant twists and surprises. The cast and crew behind the show really knew how to use the off kilter animation and artwork to their full advantage, along with music that would appropriately set the mood (often sounding classical and/or very old, unlike the electronic/techno music that seems to dominate most cartoons). It also wasn't afraid to push the boundaries of what could get past the censors, often throwing in dark and/or adult subject matter, but disguising it under a ton of symbolism and metaphors that a younger audience could understand.

After owning the first season DVD, I was thrilled to find out that the second season finally saw a release. Included are the next thirteen episodes (meaning two 11 minute cartoons to make up a half hour). Some of my favorites include ""Robot Randy"" (in which a robot created to destroy things just wants to live in peace), ""Human Habitrail"" (in which Muriel and Eustace become lab rats in a series of experiments and Courage has to save them--ending with an exciting boat chase....that's completely silent, save for the odd choice of putting classical music overtop it--goes to show just how entertainingly weird this series was), and ""The Tower of Dr. Zalost"" (the show's only half hour long episode, in which a depressed mad scientist spreads doom and gloom across the world, leaving Courage to have to find him some true happiness). Unfortunately, there's no special features what so ever. It would've been nice to have at least a featurette of some kind talking about the show's creation, or the lasting impact it had on the fans.

But despite the cut and dry release, if you loved the show, this two-disc set is a must have! Here's hoping they not only release the last two seasons, but start bringing the other Cartoon Network shows onto DVD.",1445299200,3,3142,4.869158878504673

6426895,5,B00KH57UPG,"Courage the Cowardly Dog is a cartoon that appeals to children because if it cute dog, but is more geared to adults.  It may be a little scary for young children.  But for older children and adults it is unusual, unique, and fun.",1440892800,2,229,4.3023255813953485
