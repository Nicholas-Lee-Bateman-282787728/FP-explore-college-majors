8021981,4,B000247642,"Barbara Dickson is a Scottish actress/singer who is probably best known for her hit recording (with actress/singer Elaine Paige) of the song I Know Him So well from the hit show Chess. But shes also a musician (she plays piano) and has a varied repertoire of music styles.

This DVD/CD set contains a 1987 Concert at the HUGE Royal Albert Hall in London. It was obviously made for TV in the U.K. and is making its US debut now.  Of the 10 songs she sings in the 50 minute concert, two are Randy Newman songs. One is the classic, I Think Its Going To Rain Today and the next one shows Newmans sardonic side (Its Money That I Love. She covers the U2 hit Pride (In The Name of Love and Marvin Gayes version of I Heard It Through The Grapevine. Between some of the performances are inserted short backstage interview clips where she discusses her career. One thing we learn is that she turned down the opportunity to sing the hit duet with Paige because that character has only one song in the show. The DVD does include two bonus videos: The promo video with Paige and Dickson singing their hit, and Dickson solo on Dylans Dont Think Twice, Its Alright.

Because the original recording was in the 4:3 ratio aspect, the producers have placed WHITE lines above and below the screen image on some of the songs. (Its odd because they did this on the odd number chapters (1,3, 5, and 7). I found this annoying but it may not bother you.

The CD enclosed is the audio portion of the musical performances.

I was entertained by the CD/DVD package and its a rare chance to actually see Dickson perform. Broadway and musical theater folks may enjoy it as well, though there is only one show tune here.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
