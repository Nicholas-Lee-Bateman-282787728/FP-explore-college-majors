7455847,5,B0162CMIWC,"LIKE YOU MEAN IT is a personal and poignant look at a gay couple as they try to keep their relationship together.  Honest and heartfelt, it is a glimpse inside a man trying to come to terms with his inner struggles and how they impact his relationship.  Wonderful acting by the two leads.  Writer/director Philip Karner does a terrific job with the tone, showing the relationship slowly coming undone.  A beautiful indie movie I strongly recommend.",1449964800,5,448,4.855263157894737

7455852,5,B0162CMIWC,"I was able to catch this film during a recent screening in Los Angeles, and just purchased it today.  Philipp Karner did a fantastic job, as he was wearing the hats of writer, director, AND lead.  The film did a great job of making the story very relatable whether you are gay or straight.  Relationships deal with the same sets of challenges across the board.  It definitely hit home on a lot of things Ive gone and am going through, and in the end left me feeling hopeful.  Fantastic story, full of truth, great acting.  Theres no reason you shouldnt own this film.",1449532800,,567,4.456310679611651

7455855,5,B0162CMIWC,"Even though this movie may be cast as a gay themed movie, i think it more appropriately deals with a relationship between two people, as opposed to a gay relationship. This could be any couple, any where. I like that we have gotten to a point in our society where the main theme of a movie does not revolve around the fact that two men are in a relationship, but rather the issues that face Jack & Diane are the same issues that face Jack & Jimmy. How a painful past can manifest itself over time and mould your life for years to come. How that past can influence every relationship we have, whether it be with family, friends or lovers. Philipp shows great depth exploring a wide range of emotions. So beautifully shot, I got a real sense of what it must be like to be an actor living and working in LA. I like that a movie can make me feel like i know whats it like to live in it. I was really rooting for them. I wanted them to find their happiness. Jonah is such great guy and what a beautiful voice. But as in life it doesn't always work out the way we want. Mark is cold and distant but still incredibly warm and open in his own way. As all of us flawed creatures are finding our way through life. I think there is hope for Mark. I think he was on his road to working it out. Looking forward to watching it again.",1473120000,,1319,4.076923076923077
7455856,5,B0162CMIWC,"This is probably the most realistic movie I've ever seen portraying a couple who love each other and are fighting for their relationship and unfortunately, also failing at it.  The scenes are both emotional and relatable, and not just for gay couples, but for all couples.

Mark has deep issues with insecurity, anxiety, depression, and although it's never explained, there are hints that he also has issues with his father.  For whatever reason, Mark feels like he can't talk about his issues with Jonah, which ultimately is what causes him push himself so far away from the man he loves.  Jonah knows that there are problems in the relationship, but chooses to ignore it until Mark points it out.

The acting by both of the main characters is superb!  It's so refreshing to see a gay drama that is well-acted, non cheesy, and doesn't have the same boring cliche story line.  I like that the movie focuses on real issues the couple has as people -- not just gay people, rather than the usual sort of story plot of homophobia, gay-bashing, coming out of the closet, or gay people falling in love with or secretly in love with straight people. We've seen that story over and over.  This was wonderfully different, thought-provoking, and pulled at the heartstrings.

Definitely recommended.",1472342400,,1288,4.844748858447488
7455857,5,B0162CMIWC,This movie is both beautiful and heart breaking. I loved it so much. The film had such a life like quality to it.,1466380800,,113,3.9565217391304346

7455859,4,B0162CMIWC,"Much better than I thought it would be.  Really good acting by the two leads and Jonah is adorable!  The script is good and hit home in a lot of ways.  Favorite scene:  where Mark quits an audition right in the middle.  Believable upbeat ending.  A few too many scenes in the car wash and of Mark just driving.  Overall, though, moving.",1464307200,,336,4.32258064516129

7455862,4,B0162CMIWC,"This was a nicely serious flick, and I hardly fastforwarded ever.  If a queer movie, it also suggested that homoexperiences can be generalized from the human condition.  I liked the way the camera worked, too, to suggest unspoken things as well, even when it undercut the dialogue.  So it was artful too.  Nice film.",1463616000,2,316,4.796296296296297
7455863,4,B0162CMIWC,"Mark is an actor who like many is struggling; he is having other problems and has a past of mental issues. He decides that he wants to reconnect with his caring partner  Joshua. The thing is he does not know how and in trying to do so he starts to learn more about who he actually is.

We follow him and his partner Joshua on their journey and it can be slow going at times  but life is hardly a white knuckle roller coaster ride all of the time  so I am fine with this. The issues they have seemed to be universal and not just limited to the gay community and that is exemplified by some of their straight friends who have alternate relationship issues.

Now as I said this can be slow in places but it is the resonant honesty about the characters and situations that will pull you in and make you care. It is all handled in a very adult way. It is also acted extremely well and the cinematographer has done a rather excellent job with the complimentary and often inventive camera shots. There are some bedroom scenes here too but nothing to frighten the horses or anything. It is one for people who like their films to be more on the contemplative side and if that is your thing then I am sure you will find a lot here to appreciate.",1460419200,,1235,4.194092827004219

7455869,5,B0162CMIWC,"A beautifully shot film. I still have the image of Jonah lying on top of Mark, trying to offer that weight of comfort that just doesn't succeed. There was something about that moment that really touched me and said so much about what each character was seeking, and ultimately not getting from the other. This film left me very impressed with what I believe is a very personal story for Writer/Director Philipp Karner, and looking forward to future stories he will tell.",1455667200,,470,4.7439024390243905

7455871,4,B0162CMIWC,"I saw Philipp Karner in the movie ""Kiss the Bride"" and was impressed. That light, frothy romantic comedy also landed some serious relationship messages (lots of layers and texture) and was an overall good production with some fine actors. Karner's work in this area continues with what seems to be a very personal story. It is difficult to divorce one's negative childhood familial relationships from the relationships of adulthood. Left unresolved, those childhood relationships (often dysfunctional), emerge in adult relationships of all kinds (work, friends, etc.), but they are perhaps most salient in relationships involving long-term commitments, partnerships and marriage. Without revealing too much, Karner's character (Mark) has unresolved familial dysfunction involving his father. So much so, that the news of his father's death doesn't even register a tear. On top of that, Mark is an actor--among one of the most demanding and disappointing professions on the planet. He is depressed. He is with someone, but just barely. I like this story because it highlights the truth of mental illness in many, perhaps most relationships. To say Mark's depression is probably rooted in the dysfunction of his childhood, is perhaps obvious, but it is more layered than that. Soap box time: We must acknowledge mental illness as we do other human maladies and remove the stigma attached to it. There is no shame, THERE IS NO SHAME, in recognizing that you or the person you love is depressed, anxious, angry, etc., The good news is there is help available and if your partner is willing to go through the experience with you, so much the better, but ignoring it, is not a healthy alternative. To ignore mental illness is to miss out on the good parts of living and there really are some good parts to be experienced, even though evidence to the contrary surrounds us.",1454889600,6,1866,5.101307189542483
7455872,5,B0162CMIWC,"I saw the movie recently and found it to be a true testament to love, not just love between two men but love with couples in general. I found it interesting to see how easy irbid to judge and take sides or immediately blame one person in a relationship for being a screw-up. It's great to see a film that explores the issues that are not always easy to pinpoint or to think about. I highly recommend everyone see this film as there is so much to take away for everyone!!!",1454716800,,471,4.186813186813187

7455874,5,B0162CMIWC,"I found, ""Like You Mean It,"" to be extremely relatable to my own experiences trying to pursue my dreams in the creative field while staying connected to my relationship. It's really easy to become emotionally distant when I don't feel like I'm making progress in my profession, and this film expressed this dilemma quite clearly.

7455880,4,B0162CMIWC,"This is a good film. On the surface it is about a gay couple struggling to stay together, but it is actually about one-half of this couple.

Mark, played by LIKE YOU MEAN IT'S writer/director, Philipp Karner, doesn't merely have difficulty committing, he has increasing difficulty communicating with anyone. His character is interesting, especially in that, as a professional actor, auditioning generally for voice-over assignments, he must use a wide variety of voices. That English is not his native language, and though he has mastered an infinite variety of American accents, he is finding himself unable to continue.

Jonah, his boyfriend, played by Denver Milord, is a struggling musician. What is very subtle about this movie is that it shows us typical tensions a gay couple experiences but demonstrates a unique element: Post-traumatic stress disorder. Jonah, an intelligent man, is helpless to reach Mark, whose relationship to his estranged father is the backdrop to this couple's crisis.

It is well-acted and photographed, and unlike a lot of movies which have entertainers as main characters, it shows what they do. We see that Mark isn't just an actor down on his luck. We see him auditioning and we realize he's good. When Jonah sings to Mark one night, at Mark's request, we are shown that he is good and that he is doing the sort of music heard today. This adds to the realism.

LIKE IT IS is as thoughtful as any story by John Updike or Joyce Carol Oates. The short story may be the form which has most influenced this film. In my view, that is a plus.",1453334400,,1571,4.828996282527881

7455887,5,B0162CMIWC,"This film manages to bridge the gap between mainstream relationship dramas and romantic comedies. In fact it manages to pull them together and create a perfect hybrid of the two. After seeing it and learning a bit about the filming process, I found that this is a true independent in the best sense of the word. You'll notice the name Phillipp Karner repeated multiple times throughout the credits. Normally when that happens you figure one aspect of that person's responsibility to the film would fall short, not in Philips case, he manages somehow to take on his roles as producer, actor, writer, and director and execute them all seamlessly and independent of one another.

I highly suggest this film to anyone. I say anyone cause the themes of this film are universal. Its not limited to race, gender, or sexual orientation, it deals with issues that every human person, who has ever tried to love and live at the same time, has had to face. Its not all tragic however, there are some perfectly place moments of comedy throughout the story, providing you with a respite from the realities these characters face.

To look at the cover of this film or to read a brief synopsis, one would think its easy to assume what it was going to be about. But don't make that mistake. This is a simple relationship drama with a beautiful comedic sense, made with the best traditions of an independent spirit.

(That was my critic review, this is my normal person review)

I loved it, I could relate to it, and it made me laugh. It held a mirror up to my own experiences of trying to navigate love and life. I really recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!",1452556800,,1636,4.6116838487972505

7455890,4,B0162CMIWC,"So I gave it a 4 star rating. This movie was written, performed and filmed very well. I wouldn't give it a 5 star rating because there was just something missing. Jonah has beautiful soul. The character is patient and understanding yet totally taken advantage of. Mark is somewhat of a spoiled man who needs to figure out where his life is going professionally. The film takes you through various stages that some can relate to and some you cannot. I would watch it again. As a cynical gay man living where the film is set, I can attest that we all have the love life that we want. The question is, can you notice when it is the love life that you shouldn't have? I say, go watch this film. Pay to rent it. It's eye opening on a self reflection of how people conduct themselves.",1452297600,,778,4.299319727891157
7455891,2,B0162CMIWC,"This quasi-autobiographical film by Philipp Karner (who served as writer-director and star) is a dreary self-indulgent catharsis that deals with the subject of falling out of love with your partner. Neither character (Karner as Mark and his partner Jonah) displays any chemistry with the other and one wonders if there ever really was any in the first place. There is no affection, and boredom -  especially on the part of Karner -appears to be the order of the day. An attempt to infuse their relationship with new life and renewed love by seeing a psychotherapist proves fruitless. Karner is almost obnoxious during the sessions while his partner is seemingly willing to endure anything in order to continue the relationship despite the obvious fact that it is DEAD. Except for a few scenes between Karner and his sister who communicate in German, the primary characters come off as being one-dimensional and wooden. (One reviewer noted that Karner's sibling encounters were more like padding and I would agree. Indeed. The conversations in German were almost showy and far more engaging than anything between Karner and his partner.)  At one point I even wondered how the two earned enough to pay for their basic needs. Karner was an unsuccessful aspiring actor and I'm not sure how Jonah made a livelihood. In the end, the two part company as if they had never even been together and one is left to wonder ""what was that all about?"".  Karner was brilliant in ""Kiss the Bride"" and his quadruple role (I think that he also was a producer) as well as personal emotional experience may have negatively affected what could have been a very impactive and moving subject. Instead, it made me feel as though I had accidentally walked in on someone else's gay blind date gone bad.",1451692800,,1775,4.870860927152318

7455898,5,B0162CMIWC,"Many low-budget, independent films I have seen, especially those with gay themes, are disappointing because they are amateurish, unrealized artistically and thematically.  When I begin watching one, I try to keep my expectations low.  But occasionally one appears that is so fine, so fully realized that I feel it is being cheated by not having many more viewers than it is likely to get.  I could list at least a half a dozen or more, Green Plaid Shirt at the top of it, but, though it is a very different film, Like You Mean It is as good.  I mean by that last word that it is emotionally and substantively complex, realizing that complexity through its dialogue, its plotting, its cinematography, and its acting.

The story, as Philipp Karner has said, is clearly at least semi-autobiographical.  That is a dangerous proposition, since it can easily lead either to sentimentality (the director is romantic about his former self) or to excessive distance (the director has rejected his former self).  Of course, to say ""former self"" is nonsense.  We are each inevitably bound to our pasts without necessarily having to repeat them.  That doubleness is what Karner clearly understands and his character Mark, both himself and not himself, comes to understand.  He must see himself in the past with both empathy and as clear-eyed a detachment as he can summon.

It is a sad movie in many ways.  It has been called heart-breaking, and it is certainly that.  One of the many ways in which it is original is that it starts with the relationship between its two men, Mark and Jonah.  Love is not what they find at the end of the movie but what begins it, its ""given"".  What follows is their long, painful, and perhaps and perhaps not inevitable separation.  It all depends on character, the sort of ""character"" that is often most strange and mysterious to the person himself.

Mark, who is certainly capable of emotional coldness, even, in a few moments, cruelty, is a difficult person.  What is striking is how doubly, how confused he is seen to be by both Karner the director and Karner the actor:  he is both remote and capable of tenderness, selfish and able to be emotionally generous, cold and yet also sometimes sweetly warm, as, for example, when he tries to hold hands with a man who sees their having sex together merely as a hook-up.  But capability does not equate with realization.  The relationship between him and Jonah fails in part because what he might be he can't be.  He is trapped by his own failures, and he understands that, even without being able to articulate it, not even, quite, in the couple's therapy sessions.  We know it mostly not because he can talk about his suffering but because we can see it in Karner's  remarkable performance.

Almost equally fine is Denver Milord as Jonah, whose sweetness and vulnerability find him unable to resist Mark's emotional retreat and needy self-containment.  Sometimes passivity can be mistaken for kindness.  One can never be sure with Jonah if his love is fully love or as well a sort of need for love no matter what.  The difference matters.  The film itself knows that even if neither of its two main characters can say it.  They love and do not love, each in their different and finally irreconcilable ways.  It is a dilemma which is both hard and necessary to watch as they come undone from one another.

Perhaps there are too many shots of Mark riding through L.A. in his car or sitting in it while it goes through a car wash, the latter something of a clich&eacute; in films set in that city (and elsewhere, too).  Yet those moments are expressively powerful nonetheless, with  disturbing  sounds sometimes intruding through the radio or in messages he receives.  He is and is not alone, both solitary and unable to be cut off from the world which seems not to want him.

The scene between Mark and his sister Isabella, both speaking German, is one of the film's richest, though it is brief.  His past intrudes upon his failing present and clarifies it.  That he speaks in the language of his childhood intensifies that intrusion and the emotional presence of it still in his life.  As is true between Mark and Jonah, Mark and his sister are both close and distant, emotionally bound and remote.  What so often looks like, and is, coldness in him is also a grief he is barely able to contain.  It is his need to hold it in that is part of his pain.  It is a deeply moving scene, brilliantly acted.

Like You Mean It is a fully realized film, innovative and risky.  It is far, far better than many studio films or big time independents because, though small in scale, it digs deeply into its characters' emotional lives and finds there an almost novelistic complexity.  Many gay themed films too frequently indulge in their own sorts of sentimentality, playing into fantasy and wish fulfillment.  That can be quite enjoyable in its way, and they ought not be dismissed merely because of that.  But this is not that sort of movie.  It's grown-up and difficult and, yes, heartbreaking, no less so than in its final scene which is both an opening up into new worlds for both men and a return to a past that was never allowed its fulfillment.  The abrupt cut that ends it is the work of a true artist's understanding of what needs to be left unsaid.",1450828800,22,5318,4.6534334763948495

7455900,3,B0162CMIWC,"Moderately interesting drama focusing on the gradual breakdown in the relationship between the moody Mark and the easy going Jonah.
Mark appears determined to end the affair whereas Jonah is hoping for a return to the happier days they once enjoyed.  Even though Mark instigates efforts to reignite their passion by arranging therapy and even a bungled ""date night"", he appears unwilling to legitimately fulfil them.
Nice guy partner comes across as a bit too shallow to fully cope with Mark's many personal issues
Obviously characters could have been better developed as to what drew these two together in the first place is rather vague.  There appears little communication of any depth going on and whilst they spend a lot of time together in bed, nothing much is happening there either.  Other characters except for the therapist (these scenes are really well done) appear more as padding material and all those solo car scenes with Mark and the German language scene with his sister seem more self indulgent than anything.  Why do these two guys require a cleaning woman?
Despite my reservations, it is  refreshing to see a film attempting to tackle intimate issues between gay men and thus, this is a promising first feature by writer-director Philipp Karner who also stars as the troubled and rather unsympathetic Mark.  Denver Milord is an attractive co-star even if his role as the perplexed Jonah is mainly spent flashing that infectious smile of his.
Very much Bergman material without the master of angst in attendance!

8735434,2,B0162CMIWC,"***Spoiler Review***

In Like You Mean It, Phillipp Karner plays actor Mark who is struggling with his relationships, a fledgling career, and a mild drug addiction. The entire film pretty much showcases Mark's emotional impotence in 3 different aspects of his life:

(1) His Relationship with Boyfriend Jonah - Mark rarely showed affection for Jonah and pretty much treated him like crap later in their relationship. They attend couples' therapy where the counselor instructs them to complete a series of exercises to help Mark rediscover his love for Jonah. Jonah easily recalls and identifies moments of love and bliss in their relationship while Mark fails. I'm not quite clear why Jonah extended himself so far toward Mark who doesn't reciprocate such affection. Mark was really nasty in the final therapy session, and my heart broke for Jonah.

(2) Audition Struggles - Mark struggled in auditions for bit parts throughout the movie which is clearly a reflection of the emotional void he carries. In one scene, a jerk of a casting agent asks him to read a line for the fourth time ""with energy this time"" and Mark fails by not even trying. With little humanity to make a human connection, it's ironic that Mark aspires to be an actor.

(3) Disconnected from Sister - Mark listened to a voice mail in which he sister wishes him a happy birthday. She also asked him to call her because she had other obviously important news that she did not want to leave on his voice mail. He doesn't return the call. Finally, she visits him unannounced to share news of their father's death and to deliver a box of masks that he made when he was younger that his father kept. Like Jonah, she extends listening ears and an open heart to Mark; however, he is glacial. The history of his relationship with his father was apparently a contentious one, but the film never really fleshes out the details.

Like You Mean It is beautifully shot and well acted; however, the film desperately needed more character development. What makes Mark tick? Did he ever love Jonah? More flashbacks of different loving moments in their relationship would have helped. Also, flashbacks of his relationship with his father could have given us insight into his psyche that could have inspired sympathy from the viewers for Mark. Instead, I despised him and how he treated those around him. At the end, when he finally decides to read a letter to Jonah to share what he appreciated about their relationship, I didn't care. I wanted Jonah to push him off a cliff. This was a frustrating film with a contemptible character at its center that I did not have tolerance for.",1519516800,,2635,4.782417582417582

8735436,5,B0162CMIWC,"This film is a journey of two men's lives and how the events of everyday living start to interfere with the love that bound them together.  This is a fascinating study in relationships and how these two men literally grow apart from each other.  Love can be a very fickle mistress.  The old saying, "" Just sometimes you cannot live with them and you cannot live without them,"" says it all in one chaotic group!!  NJMJr!!",1512864000,,420,4.4868421052631575
8735437,4,B0162CMIWC,"Mark has issues, there's no doubt about that. And Jonah faces challenges in life, like anyone else. But, at this point, most of Jonah's challenges are named 'Mark'.

The honest and realistic presentation of a relationship is at a high level here. The dialogue is spot on, always advancing the plot and informing the emotions of these characters. Just as effective are the quiet moments, the silent gestures shared between Mark and Jonah just as strong in the expression of their needs, doubts, hopes, and disappointments.

Both lead actors do well in communicating all of those feelings, and how they're often not on the same page about them.

Or are they? Mark and those issues of his cause him to engage in self-defeatist behavior, punishing himself for what he believes is his unworthiness of Jonah's love and support. We don't know exactly what all of those issues are because 1) he often doesn't tell Jonah and 2) this aspect of the story is the least developed. We're introduced to some teasing tidbits in various forms but we're otherwise kept in the dark, forced to conjecture.

This is gorgeously shot, wonderfully written, and beautifully scored. And I love the ending: there's possibility, hope, a chance...

I'll be watching this one again.",1506211200,,1252,4.942857142857143
