4432081,5,B004MOFGFO,What can you say about George Strait.  I am not a big fan of the second movie.  He basically has a very small cameo.  I wanted Pure Country on Blu-Ray.  You could really tell the difference and it was worth the purchase.,1431820800,,220,4.166666666666667

4432131,4,B004MOFGFO,"We purchased the VHS version of Pure Country years ago when it first came out.

We all love George Strait and, just recently, saw him in concert during his Cowboy Rides Away tour so it was natural we'd want to get a DVD of the movie.

Pure Country 2 was really not what we expected since it was not a sequel to the original and George Strait had very few parts in the movie about a young woman who is endowed with a powerful voice (The Gift) by some ""angels"".  It was entertaining but not what we expected.

If you love George, you'll love Pure Country.",1397520000,,553,4.188679245283019

4432143,5,B004MOFGFO,"Knowing that the main characters in both films , are musicians / singer/ songwriters , I already knew that both films were not going to receive any 'Best Actor/ Actress awards any time soon . But I did not know how convincing they both could be !! I highly recommend these films to anybody that wants to get away from the Action Packed -- Dramatic -- and more recent those Paranormal films -- and relax and put one or both of these good ol' family flix into the DVD player and kick back .  The story lines are a little cheesy but fun . Especially in the 2nd of the Pure Country series - 'The Gift'.  First of all , the lead actress Katrina Elam can not only sing her butt off - but is extremely nice to look at ! Yes!! Very easy on the eyes !!--- And YES-- That is her voice !! -- What really was fun to watch , was Travis Fimmel . I had watched him in films like Baytown Outlaws , where he is more of a wild and crazy long-haired red neck with a passion for shooting 'bad' people --- and now totally transformed into this -- clean cut - handsome-All American Cowboy .-- Pretty cool !! -- Anyway-- again- I recommend both films to anyone who likes the Hallmark Channel - with a little country flare .",1389398400,2,1200,4.102127659574468

4432161,5,B004MOFGFO,"I like to shop the bargain bins for DVDs. I found this ""Pure Country - Double Feature"" DVD in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I'm not a big country music fan, but I like to listen to a little from time to time and this DVD will fit well with my music-oriented DVD collection. It consist of two very different movies: ""Pure Country"" starring George Strait and ""Pure Country 2: The Gift"" starring Katrina Elam. George Strait makes  a cameo appearance in ""The Gift."" The two movies are completely different and the only thing they have in common is a devotion to country music. Both are quite enjoyable movies and I might have a  slight preference for the George Strait movie.

Both movies have a certain corn content, but if you're used to country music and country movies you'll probably find it more enjoyable than annoying. I mention this because not everybody likes the corny, down-home style. Both movies are based around country music singers, so you'll be hearing a lot of songs and musical background. It's rather well done, I might add. I've reviewed these movies independently, so if you're interested in my  specific opinions you might go to the individual movie and look up the review. Here I'm noting the double-feature packet and I'd say it was quite good. I'd give it a 4.5 star rating, but I have no way to do that. Raising it to five seems more appropriate than lowering it to four.

4432169,5,B004MOFGFO,"The original Pure Country is a classic.  Too bad George Strait didn't make a real sequel.  However, once you get over the shock that ""Dusty"" isn't the center of the new story, the second movie really grows on you.  The guardian angel subplot is reminiscent of ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Although George Strait appears in PC2, they chose not to have him do any singing.  That's the only negative about the film.  A duet or two with the star, Shannon Tweed,  would have been really nice!  So, my five star rating is really for the first movie; I love it and will have to grow to love PC2.",1358726400,,585,4.351851851851852

4432173,4,B004MOFGFO,"I love George Strait, he is the reason I bought these movies. I liked Pure Country the best, because George plays a bigger part in that movie than in #2. I love most of the songs from Pure Country. #2 has a good storyline and the main character has a wonderful voice, I just think that George should have sung one or two songs!!",1353715200,11,328,4.140625
4432174,4,B004MOFGFO,"Picture: It seems to have the saturation dialed up a bit in some areas, then others it's fine. Skintones teter on a balance of fine and too hot, as does some of the picture detail. There's a constant layer of grain throughout most of the picture, although sometimes it does to appear to have been filtered, while not affecting detail. To be honest, I've seen this film over the years on EP speed duped VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. This is a HUGE leap in detail, clarity, color, you name it. Now, is it as sharp as modern pictures or of a bigger restoration projects? No. Could Warner improve? Yes. But it is a budget release. I'm shocked it got it's own disc in the two pack with Pure Country 2.

Audio: I think that the surround mix that was created for the DVD was the same that was used here, as the bass and the surrounds kick in at the same time and about the same volume, and that's the concert scenes. Otherwise, nat sound here and there in the surrounds appear, and some bass reponse, but otherwise, it's a pretty standard audio driven film. Front three channels serve their purpose to give us some direction and separation on normal conversations and settings. Surrounds and bass is used when need be.

Special features: Trailer and a music video for ""I Cross My Heart."" Yep. I mean, this isn't a HUGE film, nor did it become a breakthrough for George, and it's not particulary popular outside of George Strait, country people, and/or country music fans. So of course nothing of value would be here. I'm surprised it got a sequel, although looking at the synopsis it's plot is a lot more ludicrous and fantasy related than this film.
Overall, not a bad Blu-ray.",1353715200,,1668,4.5016501650165015
