8235913,4,B000ZM1MPA,"Lots of Spaghetti Western action for not much investment. Do the math, 3 dvds at around 10 bucks = 9 movies, so a dollar or so per movie or $3.33 per disc. And yes, these are public domain releases, so quality & content varies per movie. However, the deciding factor here is that all 3 discs are SINGLE SIDED!!! No scratched up flippers!

And there's lots of enjoyable Spaghetti action here. DEATH RIDES A HORSE is the most widly known offering, but ANY GUN CAN PLAY, Corbucci's THE HELLBENDERS and MINNESOTA CLAY and THE GRAND DUEL and THIS MAN CAN'T DIE are some of my favorites. Recommended especially for those who want a taste of Spaghetti...you get alot of bang for your buck!

Single sided discs with 9 Spaghetti Westerns. A super value. Take the plunge, after all you can only watch John Wayne's THE WAR WAGON (a great Western!) so many times without wondering what's being done over in Italy and Spain at around the same time. This set is probably the best sampler out there. Quality-wise, hit or miss, but the value here more than compensates for any shortcomings... and again, these are single sided discs. Go for it.",1337731200,,1128,4.606965174129353
8235914,2,B000ZM1MPA,"St. Clair puts out another re-hash of some minor (and pretty bad) third rate spaghetti westerns.  they drop one of these on us every couple of years;  unfortunately, 4 or 5 of the films on each ""new release"" is on one of their previous releases, so at best, you only get one or two new ones.  although Amazon isn't listing the titles on this release, it looks like they are:
The Grand Duel (1973, 90 min)
A young gunslinger is falsely accused of murder and only one man can set things right. An actionpacked Western with European flair, starring Peter O'Brien and Horst Frank.

This Man Can't Die (1968, 90 min)
Director Gianfranco Baldanello works his magic in this classic Eurowestern, starring Guy Madison as a cowboy out for revenge against the men who killed his parents and raped his sister.

It Can Be Done, Amigo (1971, 98 min)
Jack Palance stars as Sonny, a gunfighter out for revenge against the man who dishonored his sister. Chock-full of true tongue-in-cheek Spaghetti Western wit and style. Also starring Dany Saval and Bud Spencer.

Minnesota Clay (1965, 84 min)
One of the earliest Spaghetti Western masterpieces, this film sees a captured gunslinger (Cameron Mitchell) sentenced to hang, but before his execution he escapes from prison to seek the one man who can prove his innocence. Directed by Sergio Corbucci.

Johnny Yuma (1967, 95 min)
A conniving widow gets more than she bargained for in this fun edgy film that has it all - romance, betrayal, gunfights, suspense and a great musical score. A true Eurowest classic starring Rosalba Neri and Lawrence Dobkin.

Any Gun Can Play (1967, 97 min)

Death Rides A Horse (1969, 114 min)
John Phillip Law stars as a revenge-seeking outlaw who pairs up with a veteran gunslinger (Lee Van Cleef) with an agenda of his own. With guns a' blazing, the two wreak havoc until they uncover a secret that changes everything.

The Hellbenders (1967, 92 min)

White Comanche (1967, 94 min)
The sons of an Indian mother and a white father come face to face after leading very different lives. William Shatner stars in the unforgettable lead role as the White Comanche.",1202256000,,2511,4.789351851851852
