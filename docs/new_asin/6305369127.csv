1014924,5,6305369127,"I had no intention of my son watching large amounts of television (I still don't), and I didn't plan on introducing him to television until he was much older.  However, my son had a bit of a bumpy ride for the first few months of his life and I tried everything I could think of the bring him comfort.  One day when I couldn't think of anything else, I started flipping through chanels and found Teletubbies.  It was like magic.  For the first time in months, he stopped crying.  He was so mezmerized that he didn't even noticed that I had left the room.
The thing that I love most about Teletubbies is that something that brings my son comfort and enjoyment is also educational.  Being able to take a shower, and fix myself something to eat is pretty cool too.
At 9 months old, I think the thing that my son likes best about Teletubbies is the baby 'sun'. Although he is starting to 'interact' with the Teletubbies a bit more.
So, for the past few months we have had a daily date with Teletubbies.  And now I have started buying the videos.  That way we can watch the whenever we want and not have to plan our day around a TV schedule.
We LOVE Teletubbies and recomend them to every parent and child.",1024876800,10,1201,4.306666666666667
1014925,5,6305369127,"What makes the Teletubbies so enjoyable for young children is their predictability. The opening section of this video is just that, predictable. The Teletubbies all gather together with their favorite things- but uh oh... someone has lost something. Each Teletubbie loses his/her favorite thing, as each items is found, they gather together again, only to find someone else has lost his/her favorite thing. And so it goes, until every favorite item has been lost and been found.
The ship segment is my favorite segment: nice music and great graphics. My children both enjoy this segment. The boy, Ned riding his bike is very fun and reminds my son of how he enjoys riding bikes.
I know there is controversy on the Teletubbies. However, I think they are cute and harmless. Surely they don't teach anything negative, they teach hugs and fun and sharing and caring, if they teach anything at all. Mainly I use this video (and all others and TV) as a time for my kids to wind down at the end of the day or just prior to nap. A short time to just sit and turn off their brains for a few minutes.
Enjoy.",1024185600,10,1097,4.573604060913706
1014926,5,6305369127,"As others note, the ""Ned"" video (a little boy getting ready to go for a bike ride) is great, and the splashing-pool video is fun, too.  But I've had the same experience as another parent -- my son is terrified by the ships sequence (which is only a few minutes long -- but we have to fast-forward through it).",1022803200,4,309,4.237288135593221
1014927,4,6305369127,"My 20 month old son loves this video, however, he is so frightened by the ships sequence that I have to stop the tape and fast forward it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? My son gets a kick out of the padding pool scene because he loves getting wet. Ned is a riot as he goes about trying to fix his bike.",976060800,3,314,3.921875
1014928,5,6305369127,"My friend has children, so I have been exposed, like it's a virus.
Not for the faint of heart.
I grew up on Sigmund and the Seamonsters and other such nonsence that S/M Kroft could wrest out of their crazed brains,  but this is nuts. These children's soft personalities will be partially  formed by this. I am impressed.",950572800,3,320,4.5

7888329,4,6305369127,This was my kids first video and most favorite-they watched it countless hours over and over and over.......and over. Teletubbies (like fingernails running down a chalkboard to me)as annoying as they are to grown ups-they keep the attention of the weee lil' ones and put that beautiful little smile right where it belongs!!! Recommend highly for ages 6 months to 2 1/2 years.,1109808000,,375,4.968253968253968
7888330,4,6305369127,"Powerful metaphor for the loss of the British Empire as Dipsy searches all over for a missing hat.  Tinky Winky and his controversial bag (...) is also lost, as well as Po's scooter, symbolic of the once powerful British Navy.
Don't miss the stirring performance by Laa-Laa in her lament over a misplaced yellow ball.  Laa-Laa was definitely robbed by the Academy when they overlooked this powerful emote-o-fest.",1081641600,,412,5.044117647058823
7888331,5,6305369127,"Let me set the record straight, for those of you who dislike these folks: I hated Teletubbies! I thought it was a foursome of weird characters, that couldn't talk well, etc... Well, while they continue to be weird (though you gotta admit they're kinda cute), and they still haven't gotten past the ""He-o!"" (for 'Hello!') one thing Laa-Laa, Tinky Winky, Dipsy and Po have done is make my baby laugh and calm down when cranky in a way only Baby Mozart is able to do. So all other criticism became secondary after I saw this happen over and over. He just loves it, so it's become one of the 2-3 official videos to be played while his mom and I fix breakfast, because it ""buys"" us enough time! :)
This particular video has a particular story where all Teletubbies loose an item each: a ball, a bag, a hat and a scooter; to be found later on. What is interesting about it is the repetition within it: repetition of words in the dialogs, in the scenes during the searches for each item, etc. in a way that becomes educative, since the babies learn about patterns, things and colors in the process.
If you haven't gotten yourself a copy of ""Baby Mozart"" I'd probably recommend you do that before, but if you already have that covered, you have to have Teletubbies' ""Favorite Things"".",1079222400,2,1276,4.504310344827586
7888332,5,6305369127,"My two boys, ages 35 and 21 months just never seem to tire of Teletubbies. We have numerous videos and this one is very well liked. Sometimes I think they are starting to out grow the novelty of Tubbies, but they always eventually start asking for Teletubby videos ""again, again""! Teletubbies are very consistent, just what babies and toddlers desire and thrive on. This volume, like all others, has everything you expect from the television series format. The tubbies are always entertaining, kind, friendly, and love to have fun. What more desirable personality traits could any parent hope for in thier children?",1028505600,4,615,5.03921568627451
