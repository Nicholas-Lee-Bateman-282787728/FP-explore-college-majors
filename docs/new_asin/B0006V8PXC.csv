2409153,4,B0006V8PXC,"I'd never heard of this movie before, but came across it as an Amazon rental.  I was impressed.  It is fun, has twists and turns in the plot, and will make you laugh.  James Stewart certainly played a different role than usual, but he did a good job at it (of course, I've never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like).  It's a good, clean, old-fashioned movie with romance, intrigue, and a bit of tension.  Really it's a fun adventure the whole family could enjoy without having to fast-foward or cover your kids' eyes or ears, unlike a lot of movies nowadays.

When James Stewart's character promises to clear a soft-of friend's name by looking for a murderer, he has no idea what he's getting into.  He certainly doesn't want Claudett's character tagging along, but she can't seem to help it--she likes James and she likes the thrill of danger.  She ends up helping him out of a tough spot on more than one occasion, including one moment when he's just stepped off the ferry, thinking he's rid of her and one step closer to finding a clue about the murderer, when the police, who are hot on his trail for hiding their suspect, show up.  Luckily he's disguised in a scout uniform and thick glasses, but they still want to question him about the guy they're chasing.  Claudett shows up at the same time and cleverly spins a tale about her eloping with him, an English actor.  And that's just a taste of the treat you're in for if you watch It's a Wonderful World.  I highly recommend this movie!",1373932800,6,1504,4.429090909090909
2409154,5,B0006V8PXC,"It's Jimmy Stewart, what more could a Jimmy Stewart movie lover ask for.  Jimmy Stewart, Claudette Colbert, Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, if you are a fan of any of these actors you'll love this picture.  I love screwball comedies!",1355529600,,226,4.769230769230769
2409155,5,B0006V8PXC,"When this film was made, Colbert had been around long enough to have had a year as highest paid actress in Hollywood and a year as highest paid performer. She was both a sure-thing box office hit and a highly respected professional. She was versatile: comedy or drama, she could do it all. Steward was acquiring versatility: he had featured with tough guy, Edward G. Robinson, and done comedy (and even a song) in a film with Eleanor Powell. He was fast moving into stardom,
Both show their comedy side in this dizzy dazzler, with Stewart as a private detective, on the way to Sing Sing (although it doesn't say so), who would do anything for a buck (or, as in this case, 100,000 bucks--more than a million in today's coin of the realm). Not to reveal any more than necessary, his path crosses with a daffy poetess, who becomes attached to him. The plot line: how is he to clear himself, while saving his client from THE (electric) CHAIR. Edgar Kennedy and Guy Kibbee are excellent in their patented comedic roles and Nat Pendleton is the epitome of the Dumb Cop. In a brief appearance, the virtuoso of innumerable radio roles (and later a frequent guest on the Jack Paar Show), Hans Conreid, is recognizable.
Most of the comedy is anything but subtle. Physical gags and outrageous mugging are the norm. So, too, are the expert comedic way with lines of both stars.
I wouldn't call this a classic film, if only because it does almost anything for a laugh. I would say that many people will find this 70 some odd year old film a pleasure.",1318204800,20,1537,4.532374100719425
2409156,5,B0006V8PXC,"I saw this movie on TCM a long time ago and researched and it was not on DVD yet. I was crushed because I love James Stewart and this movie was great. This past month it showed again on TCM and I looked it up and saw it had been released oh that was a great day! It is a wonderful, fun, enchanting, classic, story that will keep you interested and laughing the whole time with a little bit of mystery surrounding it. I'm not writing out a synopsis, but I will say if you like James Stewart and Claudette Colbert in anything you will love them in this and it is for sure worth the buy and the watch!",1315872000,3,598,3.9916666666666667
2409157,5,B0006V8PXC,"This is a fairly unknown title, but with these actors, how can you miss? It's a fun romantic comedy that every Jimmy Stewart fan should see.",1293235200,,140,4.423076923076923
2409158,4,B0006V8PXC,"This is a neglected, but very, very funny film. James Stewart is on the run from the police, but his troubles have hardly begun compared to when he runs into dizzy dame Claudette Colbert.

The scene in the apple orchard is simply side-splitting, with Colbert proving what a brilliant comedienne she could be.

This film is full of crazy characters, including Edgar Kennedy at his most incompetent. ""Screwball"" really is the correct word for this one, and it is up there with the very best of them.

I should point out that this is an official DVD-R download from Warner which played with no problems. However, it has to be said that the copy of the film used here is fairly poor with numerous picture faults. A copy from U.K. TV which I saw wasn't any better, so perhaps this is the best that has survived - which is a shame.

Don't let this put you off, because it would be unfortunate to miss seeing this brilliant film. Highly recommended with slight reservations.",1293148800,24,967,4.572254335260116
2409159,3,B0006V8PXC,"It was hard to believe I had never seen this film before.  In fact, I had never even heard of it.  Jimmy Stewart, Claudette Colbert, a script by Ben Hecht?  Leonard Maltin describes it as ""very, very funny.""  I figured I was in for a real treat.  Unfortunately, it turned out that there were good reasons for this being a rather obscure film -- it's just not very good.  The main problem is the script.  The idea is pretty good:  Stewart plays a private detective who gets arrested while trying to clear a millionaire client of murder.  He escapes and has various adventures with Colbert while on the run.  Unfortunately, it's just not very funny (I don't know what Maltin was thinking).  There is an over reliance on slapstick and physical humor -- Stewart wearing as a disguise glasses that he can't actually see through, his partner repeatedly getting hit on the head, and so on.  Anyone looking for snappy dialog from Ben Hecht won't find it here.  Much as I love Jimmy Stewart, his performances could sometimes edge into the shrill.  That happens a number of times in this one, perhaps because he is trying to use the energy of his delivery to compensate for the weakness of some of the dialog.

If you are a 1930s movie buff, this one is worth seeing, but I give a disappointing 2 1/2 stars.",1279584000,18,1297,4.506437768240343

2409162,5,B0006V8PXC,"I know that  ""It's a Wonderful World"" sounds like a cheap knock-off of the classic ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Don't let that stop you from watching this gem, because the two films couldn't be more different.

This is funny, fast-paced, and allows Stewart and Colbert to show their acting chops with a comedic flavor. There is great chemistry between these two actors. Jimmy Stewart has a wonderful way of addressing a woman with such genuine sincerity that her heart HAS to melt. Claudette Colbert has a way of thinking fast and sticking by her man that makes you antsy to wish her 'man' would come to his senses.

I listened to several scenes over and over again because the plot does get kind of twisty-turny. It's a good plot. You could say that the cast is multiplied by at least 5 before the final scene gives you the original characcters as they are.",1466553600,3,854,4.568627450980392

2409190,4,B0006V8PXC,In reference to the negative reviews of this and so many other old movies: People who don't like the slapstick or outdated themes presented in old black and white movies shouldn't watch them. Most acting in these pictures (of which I own hundreds) is nave and innocent. I know the stories are often contrived and unrealistic.  It's a MOVIE!!! Hello.,1392854400,9,349,4.816666666666666

2409192,4,B0006V8PXC,"This is one of Jimmy Stewart's earlier roles, but he is of course quite good, as is Claudette Colbert.  Very fun movie to watch - was the first time I had seen it.  Snappy dialog (written by one of the writers of 'His Girl Friday') that pushes the (predictable) story along.  If you like the actors, you should enjoy the movie!  Glad to have it in my collection.",1390867200,2,362,4.279411764705882

2409194,2,B0006V8PXC,"I never thought I'd be watching the clock in hopes a Jimmy Stewart or Claudette Colbert movie would end soon--let alone do that when the movie featured both of them--but I was hugely relieved when this clinker was finally over.

The plot was completely unbelievable from start to finish. The dialogue wasn't witty, realistic, or funny. And I've never seen Claudette Colbert be half as shrill, simpering, and downright annoying as she was in this film--everything from batting her eyes to fainting to hysteria.

So, my advice to old movie buffs is to invest your $3 in Sullivan's Travels, My Man Godfrey, or To Be or Not To Be (or No Time for Love, if you're a Claudette Colbert fan). All are far better classic films than this one.",1389484800,,731,4.658914728682171

2409196,1,B0006V8PXC,"Even the charm of Stewart & Colbert couldn't save this stinker!  It's a wonderful life is one of my favorites, but don't let this title fool you.

2409197,5,B0006V8PXC,It's a Wonderful World is a lovely film much overlooked in favour of it's near namesake. It stars James Stewart (that alone makes it worth watching) but this adds Claudette Colbert as the fly in JS's ointment.  Very funny and touching.,1378166400,,235,4.7317073170731705
2409198,3,B0006V8PXC,"Okay I hate saying this because I love Jimmy Stewart and Claudette Colbert, but unfortunately this is not one of their better films. Personally I think it has nothing to do with either of the actors or their acting abilities. I really think it has to do with the weakness of the script. With the right script these two are amazing. I've seen plenty of their other movies. If you're new to old films this is not a good one to start with. But anyone who adores old films and is an old hand at them go ahead and check this out. Its worth watching for the sake of the actors and their body of work, but not a classic.",1375488000,3,613,4.116666666666666
2409199,3,B0006V8PXC,"it's funny and it's got Jimmy Stewart, but some bits are offensive. Those 1939 values really are pathetic. So, here's Jimmy Stewart, hiding out in a regional theatre production of ""What Price Glory,"" with the characters, during the course of the play, rubbing dirt on their faces to camouflage themselves in war. He's confronted by police officers who are looking for him, and he, there in a kind of ""blackface,"" starts speaking what apparently passed for ebonics in 1939. Someone else mentions going to Harlem and another person says something substantially to the effect that they'll have to put their blackface on. Jimmy Stewart punches Claudette Colbert.  So all that's gruesome, but also there's Claudette Colbert at age 36, looking a bit matronly, and the storyline shamelessly stealing from ""It Happened One Night"" (but Jimmy Stewart is a DETECTIVE, not a journalist, see?). Still, it's funny, and Jimmy Stewart is just so terrific, in spite of all the screenplay dreck.",1374537600,,977,5.10625
