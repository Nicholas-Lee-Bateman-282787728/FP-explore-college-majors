3156088,4,B0016G8HX4,"This product would deserve a 5-star if only it had just one more disk on correlations, regression, and hypothesis testing. Without that additional disk, it is a VERY GOOD AND NECESSARY product for beginners, but not as useful as it could be for people who want to start applying statistics in their work. What I mean is the following: probability is nice and pretty, and even necessary in sampling etc -- however, it is hardly sufficient, and the little space devoted to statistics here means that these DVDs are only a starting point to loads of additional study.

Having said that, the strengths of these DVDs are those of the usual Jason Gibson DVDs: solid stuff, enthusiastically presented, for enduring knowledge. Even if one happens to forget something, it is always a pleasure to go back and watch the relevant section. The presenter has a true gift for communicating concepts he is clear, he uses interesting examples, and he really puts himself in the student's seat to focus on questions and tricks that lead to true knowledge.",1210464000,45,1037,4.858757062146893

3156091,5,B0016G8HX4,"Jason is just soooo cool.  He has perfect instincts for what he is doing.  I think he is an engineer by trade, if i am not mistaken, which is maybe why he knows exactly what to emphasize.  It is such a pleasure watching him work. He is unassuming, and has a deep understanding of his subject. You HAVE to admire his audacity.  Just him, a few particularly squeeky dry erase markers, and a white board. No editing majic, no bumper music, no distractions.  It is a close as you can get to having a live tutoring session.  I will watch, with great pleasure, every dvd he produces.  Other dvds, I watch most all of them, you might get one or two gems if you are lucky.  Jasons lessons are a string of pearls.  He is tireless, consistent, very personable.

3156092,4,B0016G8HX4,"I started the DVD shortly after receiving it and worked through the first 2 sections immediately. I like the straight forward approach that Jason Gibson has to teaching the material. These DVDs work well for me because I can go over the material as often as I want to ensure a good understanding. If you want to review or learn the Probability and Statistics for the first time, I recommend you buy these DVDs.",1374969600,,410,4.554054054054054

3156094,5,B0016G8HX4,"I am 44 years old and I'm having to go back to school to pass some calculus classes to basically keep my defense engineering job (the government is really getting strict and demanding on the computer scientists and engineers it will hire).  The big problem is I never went beyond College Algebra 1 and 2, and that was over 10 years ago, and due to lack of use, I've pretty much forgot it all again.  Back in high school, I passed standard algebra with fairly average grades at best, and was never exposed to trig at all.  So you can color me desperate for a ""crash course"" solution to basically getting not only calculus in my head so I can pass a few classes to keep my job, but also provide a total review of even some basic math skills I've forgotten.  I have forgotten pretty much all of algebra as well due to lack of use, and I have never been exposed to trig, a prerequisite of learning Calculus.

In short, I basically have to learn it ALL.  And FAST.

I  bought a few of these DVDs (featuring Jason Gibson) because of all the high reviews on Amazon.  WOW!  Worth every penny.  The first disc I popped in was the 1st-7th Grade Math DVD.  Jason Gibson's teaching style alone actually attracted my kids into the TV room.  All 3 of them (aged 6 to 14) all eventually wound up sitting next to me and watching the DVD with me!  It immediately solved several different areas that my kids were struggling with that I didn't even know they were having problems with (Egad, bad Dad!).  I was impressed both by the way Jason Gibson instructs (my kids like him, which says it all) and the way he repeats each lesson multiple times to make sure you ""get it"" before moving on to the next lesson/topic.  TOTALLY perfect for me, because I really need my hand held like a little kid as I crash my way from basic mathematics up through algebra, trig, and calc.  Embarrassing to admit all of this, but hey, math is really tough for most of us, and that's if we didn't forget it altogether since high school or college.

I do not have thousands and thousands of dollars in my pocket for prerequisite/catch-up pre-calc college courses or personal tutors in prep for my calculus classes.  I'm lucky to get a tax return.  What I DID do, however, especially after seeing the immediate results with my kids, is I bought the whole entire ""Math Tutor"" DVD set (making sure Jason Gibson is the instructor), I think I paid about $250-300 here on Amazon for all of them combined.  They are now a large ""Math Tutor Library"" sitting in my TV room that both myself and the kids can access at any time for any cramming or homework assistance we may need.

This DVD set is a total jackpot, exactly what I needed, and also acts as the perfect ""good grade insurance"" for my kids.  As a Dad, I feel I've helped my kids with their homework in the best possible way I possibly could have - I have basically brought into my home a friendly, permanent, personal, likeable, 24/7-available, Ph. D-level Math Tutor of the highest caliber for my kids who covers nearly every single topic of mathematics that my kids will experience in their studies and in real life.  This includes college-level instruction.

I could not be any happier with this purchase, so much so that I bought ALL of these Math Tutor DVDs just so I could have the entire set and cover every base no matter what classes my or any of my kids will ever take.

Looking forward to coming back in a year or so after I take my own classes to post the results of using these DVDs to basically save my butt, job, and family's well-being).  I have already been thoroughly enjoying the wonderful results they have produced in my kids' math grades at school, so buy with confidence.  These DVDs are excellent, both in ""damage control"" for bad grades and ""good grade insurance"" for you or your kids.",1330992000,9,3821,4.427753934191703
3156095,5,B0016G8HX4,I'm a math teacher and am often frustrated by the fact that people who are great at math are not necessarily great at explaining it to others.  Often students are simply bombarded with formula after formula without any clear understanding of where the formuluas come from and how to apply them to actual problems.  The instructor on this video clearly explains and justifies each formula and gives detailed examples of how to use the formulas to solve real problems.  I highly recommend this video.,1328745600,,498,4.904761904761905
3156096,5,B0016G8HX4,"Having put Statistics II off until the very last class of my Ph. D. program in Health Psychology, I was concerned when I had no choice, and had to finally take it. It had been 3 years since I had taken Statistics, and didn't do well, when I did, so the thought of taking it up a notch was an issue. Will this teach you everything you need to know? Maybe not; it WILL however, teach you everything you need to know, to have the confidence, and ability, to learn anything else in the area of statistics. This guy is a master at making it simple, and memorable, and you can bet that I'll be buying some of his other DVD's.....not because I really need them, at this point, but because he makes learning that simple.",1323734400,3,712,4.242647058823529
3156097,5,B0016G8HX4,"I only wish this course went more into Statistics, as a couple of reviewers had already stated. Very happy with the outstanding quality of the probability material, but hopefully Jason Gibson will do a badly needed separate full Statistics follow-up course, as I'm sure his teaching style would demystify various traditional Statistics topics as well.

3156098,5,B0016G8HX4,"This is a great preparation for 1st semester college level statistics. I did really well because of this DVD, along with my ""Idiot's Guide to Statistics"". Previously I had used his ""Fractions thru algebra"" and ""algebra 2"" DVDs to get me ready for college algebra 1. I got an A in algebra 1 and an A- in stats because of the DVD prep.

However, at U of Phoenix, my major demands 2 semesters of stats and you have no prep course available for the second semester of stats, Mr Gibson! I have no idea how I'll get through such a tough subject without a lecture, since U of P doesn't provide lectures, but I'll have to rely on my ""idiot's"" book, I guess.

Overall, Mr Gibson does a great job of explaining stuff, and I appreciate his series. Please do an advanced stats course, Mr. Gibson- you're a good teacher and you'll save a lot of hopeless math students out there like me.",1303689600,2,873,4.3496932515337425
3156099,5,B0016G8HX4,"For a first time in 10 years, I actually enjoy doing math. Jason is a very good instructor who actually make math interesting and simple. I highly recommend this DVDs.

3156100,5,B0016G8HX4,"I am a teacher who has been tasked to teach statistics with my science class and I needed a thorough refreshing on the subject.

I read books and I was being even more confused! so I started looking for a multimedia product (which suits my learning style) and I opted for Jason's DVD and was pleased I did.

The DVDs were with me in Scotland wihing 10 days and I spent my weekend viewing them and they are the best learning resource I have viewed as a learner myself for many years. Jason is an excellent presenter and knows his stuff and his presentation style puts learners at ease and as he says ""it is no big deal"" - sometimes mathematical ideas and formulae are shrouded in mystery - this guy gets rid of that and gives numerous examples to illustrate the points.

I would certainly recommend this set of DVDs to you if you need a refresher or indeed are starting from no previous knowledge.",1273536000,3,896,4.385542168674699
3156101,5,B0016G8HX4,"I need stats for use with 6 Sigma in manufacturing, so I am not the target audience of high schoolers. The video does not come with a booklet or a Web site for reference, however, I don't think those would be necessary. The instructor works with a single camera and white board and walks through each concept in a clear, understandable way.

While problems are a pain in the neck, the instructor walks through each one, giving clear explanations on the processes and techniques he uses. The problems augment the conceptual learning, not merely repeat it.

If you are struggling with stats in school or need to learn stats outside of a classroom, like I am, this is an effective, cheap way to do it.",1269907200,3,698,4.576
3156102,5,B0016G8HX4,These DVDs are excellent.  They explain topics very well and give you practice problems which they walk you through.  Anyone taking a Probability and Statistics class would benefit from this product.,1269648000,2,199,5.387096774193548
3156103,5,B0016G8HX4,"This instructor does an amazing job in teaching the subject of statistics.

3156104,5,B0016G8HX4,"Without this DVD I would have easily failed my class.  This easy to understand no frills DVD covers all the basics of elementary statistics that you will need. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.  I could not have passed my class without it.  I was especially pleased with the basic teaching method.  There is no music or fancy graphics.  It is the instructor in front of a white board.  GREAT GREAT GREAT!

Good job putting this no nonsense DVD together.  Best money ever spent.",1259539200,2,488,4.658823529411765

3156106,5,B0016G8HX4,"As with all of the mathtutor DVDs I've viewed (geometry through calculus 3), this DVD set is a guy standing in front of a white board working problems and explaining the solutions step-by-step.  No gimmicks, nothing fancy, but effective at communicating the central ideas of a course of study.  This DVD set is probably best used as a supplement to an introductory probability and statistics course or for a quick review prior to beginning a calculus-based probability and statistics course.  Assumes knowledge of high school algebra and counting principles.  As a fan of these products, I hope that an advanced, calculus-based probability and statistics DVD set is also in the works.",1253145600,,684,5.135135135135135

3156109,5,B0016G8HX4,"I have not taken any probability or statistics since my grad school days back in the late sixties and early seventies.  So last month I bought an introductory statistics text.  For some reason I just could not get much out of the textbook so I went ahead and purchased this DVD set.

I have several of Jason's DVD sets and this one did not disappoint.  Pretty soon the cobwebs began to clear.  As usual the style and content of this DVD is perfect for someone just being introduced to the subject and for guys like myself who have forgotten most of the stuff.  Note that the material covered here is an introduction so don't expect detail stuff on regression etc.  As always I appreciate the simplicity of the presentation without any boring music or poor jokes and other bells and whistles.

A great set and for the material presented a true bargain - the cost was significantly less than the textbook I purchased.",1229040000,4,915,4.570552147239264
3156110,5,B0016G8HX4,"This DVD is a great resource for those of us taking graduate level statistics.  If you are not the best at statistics and would like a refresher on the fundamentals, then this is the DVD set for you.  Jason does an awesome job of explaining the key concepts and goes through several example problems in each section.  For the price, you really can't beat it as you can review a section over and over again until you get it.

One word of caution, don't purchase this if you are looking for advanced statistics and probability help.  This DVD set does not cover hypothesis testing or point estimates, or linear regressions.  According to the website for these DVDs, they are considering a release of an advanced Statistics DVD, but not time frame was given.",1222300800,4,755,4.639097744360902

*THIS GUY IS A SPECTACULAR TEACHER*
He has obviously been teaching this stuff for a long time, knows which areas give people trouble, and spends extra time on those areas.  Sure, if you already know how to average numbers, you don't need to see it done step by step again, but most of the material is new to me and I appreciate the way he hammers each point home.  Plus, each DVD is split into sections, so you can skip the sections you already know and replay the ones you need more practice on.  I highly recommend this.",1211673600,20,799,4.3355704697986575

3390597,5,B0016G8HX4,"I am a teacher who has been tasked to teach statistics with my science class and I needed a thorough refreshing on the subject.

I read books and I was being even more confused! so I started looking for a multimedia product (which suits my learning style) and I opted for Jason's DVD and was pleased I did.

The DVDs were with me in Scotland wihing 10 days and I spent my weekend viewing them and they are the best learning resource I have viewed as a learner myself for many years. Jason is an excellent presenter and knows his stuff and his presentation style puts learners at ease and as he says ""it is no big deal"" - sometimes mathematical ideas and formulae are shrouded in mystery - this guy gets rid of that and gives numerous examples to illustrate the points.

I would certainly recommend this set of DVDs to you if you need a refresher or indeed are starting from no previous knowledge.",1273536000,3,896,4.385542168674699
3390598,5,B0016G8HX4,"I need stats for use with 6 Sigma in manufacturing, so I am not the target audience of high schoolers. The video does not come with a booklet or a Web site for reference, however, I don't think those would be necessary. The instructor works with a single camera and white board and walks through each concept in a clear, understandable way.

While problems are a pain in the neck, the instructor walks through each one, giving clear explanations on the processes and techniques he uses. The problems augment the conceptual learning, not merely repeat it.

If you are struggling with stats in school or need to learn stats outside of a classroom, like I am, this is an effective, cheap way to do it.",1269907200,3,698,4.576
3390599,5,B0016G8HX4,These DVDs are excellent.  They explain topics very well and give you practice problems which they walk you through.  Anyone taking a Probability and Statistics class would benefit from this product.,1269648000,2,199,5.387096774193548
3390600,5,B0016G8HX4,"This instructor does an amazing job in teaching the subject of statistics. For a frightening subject, he does an outstanding job at breaking down the elements into elementary steps that are easy to understand. My grade went from a solid D to an A over the course of a month, after using this DVD. Excellent buy!",1267920000,3,311,4.571428571428571
3390601,5,B0016G8HX4,"Without this DVD I would have easily failed my class.  This easy to understand no frills DVD covers all the basics of elementary statistics that you will need. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.  I could not have passed my class without it.  I was especially pleased with the basic teaching method.  There is no music or fancy graphics.  It is the instructor in front of a white board.  GREAT GREAT GREAT!

Good job putting this no nonsense DVD together.  Best money ever spent.",1259539200,2,488,4.658823529411765
3390602,5,B0016G8HX4,"I have purchased a number of dvds in this series and they are all very good. The philosophy of the series is to focus on problems, not theory, but this dvd does an exceptionally good job of providing a theoretical framework as well as problem strategies. highly recommended for introduction or review",1253664000,,300,4.788461538461538
3390603,5,B0016G8HX4,"As with all of the mathtutor DVDs I've viewed (geometry through calculus 3), this DVD set is a guy standing in front of a white board working problems and explaining the solutions step-by-step.  No gimmicks, nothing fancy, but effective at communicating the central ideas of a course of study.  This DVD set is probably best used as a supplement to an introductory probability and statistics course or for a quick review prior to beginning a calculus-based probability and statistics course.  Assumes knowledge of high school algebra and counting principles.  As a fan of these products, I hope that an advanced, calculus-based probability and statistics DVD set is also in the works.",1253145600,,684,5.135135135135135

3390606,5,B0016G8HX4,"I have not taken any probability or statistics since my grad school days back in the late sixties and early seventies.  So last month I bought an introductory statistics text.  For some reason I just could not get much out of the textbook so I went ahead and purchased this DVD set.

I have several of Jason's DVD sets and this one did not disappoint.  Pretty soon the cobwebs began to clear.  As usual the style and content of this DVD is perfect for someone just being introduced to the subject and for guys like myself who have forgotten most of the stuff.  Note that the material covered here is an introduction so don't expect detail stuff on regression etc.  As always I appreciate the simplicity of the presentation without any boring music or poor jokes and other bells and whistles.

A great set and for the material presented a true bargain - the cost was significantly less than the textbook I purchased.",1229040000,4,915,4.570552147239264
3390607,5,B0016G8HX4,"This DVD is a great resource for those of us taking graduate level statistics.  If you are not the best at statistics and would like a refresher on the fundamentals, then this is the DVD set for you.  Jason does an awesome job of explaining the key concepts and goes through several example problems in each section.  For the price, you really can't beat it as you can review a section over and over again until you get it.

One word of caution, don't purchase this if you are looking for advanced statistics and probability help.  This DVD set does not cover hypothesis testing or point estimates, or linear regressions.  According to the website for these DVDs, they are considering a release of an advanced Statistics DVD, but not time frame was given.",1222300800,4,755,4.639097744360902
3390608,5,B0016G8HX4,"I am studying for the Certified Quality Engineer exam, which is heavy on statistics.  I am taking a refresher course to help but it assumes I already know this stuff.  I was getting behind in class so I ordered this course along with a couple of others that weren't much help.
*THIS GUY IS A SPECTACULAR TEACHER*
He has obviously been teaching this stuff for a long time, knows which areas give people trouble, and spends extra time on those areas.  Sure, if you already know how to average numbers, you don't need to see it done step by step again, but most of the material is new to me and I appreciate the way he hammers each point home.  Plus, each DVD is split into sections, so you can skip the sections you already know and replay the ones you need more practice on.  I highly recommend this.",1211673600,20,799,4.3355704697986575

8262225,5,B0016G8HX4,"Probability and statistics can be very easy or extremely frustrating depending on how you are taught.  I can be the bane of any college algebra student if your class tacks a few weeks of it onto the end of class, because it looks like nothing else that was was studied the entire semester, and if you have a teacher that is not great at explaining it, it can seem like complete nonsense.  It was certainly the hardest part of my college algebra class, and really the only material I never could grasp, so much so that I answered one of the bonus questions on my final ""I don't care"".

Jason however does a great job breaking the problems down and making sense out of them.  Far better than any of the books do, and better than my teacher did.  As is his style, he goes through a ton of examples, breaks down what each question is asking for and how to interpret them so you can easily spot the difference between a permutation and combination, and when using a particular solution method is needed versus another one.  Given that the math in many of the problems are extremely easy, at least at the level of the kind of problems encountered in this set (he has since released several more volumes under the title The Statistics Tutor) which tackle more complex problems than this set has, even in the more advanced problems knowing the kind of question it is and the process used to work through it is 95% of the complexity.

I have not taken a regular statistics class so I am not sure how much of that material this covers.  I do know it will show you how to do most, if not all, of the problem types you would see in a college algebra class that tacks probability onto the very end of the semester.  I will be taking an engineering data analysis class (which is basically just applied statistics) this fall, with a teacher that does not have a great reputation, so I am using this and Jason's other statistics sets to get the basics of the material down.  I do however have enough experience with Jason's other DVD sets to know he never covers every topic that a class will expose you to, but goes through the big topics you are most likely to see on exams and quizzes.  So while it is not a substitute for going to class, it will give you a good handle on the material and I highly recommend it.

I have used many of Jason's DVD sets.  I have been going back to school for an electrical engineering degree.  I have used, and reviewed almost all of Jason's courses, from basic algebra, to the advanced engineering material.  You have to know whether a DVD will fit your learning style.  He basically gives example heavy lectures.  He rarely works through any kind of proof material, just focusing on problems, but at the end of the day, it is still him standing in front of a white board doing problems.  So if you are a visual and audio learner, it is great.  He works through everything step by step, and explains everything he is doing for every problem.  He rarely ever skips steps and when he does it is only because it is the same thing he has shown in multiple problems up to that point and makes a point to at least tell you what steps he is skipping so you are not lost, unlike a lot of times when books skip them.",1464393600,,3226,4.327242524916944

Jason makes it a pony to show students visual diagrams in connection with solutions so the light-bulb turns on over a students head. I have several of Jason's DVD's and they are all fantastic.,1408060800,,409,4.857142857142857
