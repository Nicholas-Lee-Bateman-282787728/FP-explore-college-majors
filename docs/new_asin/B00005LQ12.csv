7944237,5,B00005LQ12,I had this on VHS IN 2001 and yes I knew it was a pocket budget film but i found a lotta parts hilarious!!! Amazon has allowed me to find a lotta movies that I thought I'd never see again. So it was twice as nice to see it was on DVD!,1366761600,,234,3.519230769230769

I am not going to waste a lot of time on plot or actors because it really doesn't have either in the film. This was an independant film on a budget, rating really low on the ""why would you buy"" scale. I think I might have seen a handicam shakin out part of this movie, too, because the mood in this is supposed to be one thing but it turns to something different.

I saw a review from someone that knew an actor from the local area and even they could find nothing to say except ""I even knew one of the guys in it."" cold but deservedly a 1/5.",1304121600,,623,3.8976377952755907
7944239,1,B00005LQ12,"Okay, not only have I seen this abomination, I know one of the actors in it.  DO NOT waste your time on this unless you are trying to support the director.  The fact that it is set in the hood is not enough reason to buy this disjointed and abysmal pice of drek.  The storyline is choppy at best, and frankly, the whole movie is only a vehicle to promote the director and the lead actor who has pretentions of being funny.  The best use for this DVD would be as a coaster.",1017964800,,472,4.043010752688172
7944240,1,B00005LQ12,"I watch a lot of independent movies and I take into account that many filmmakers do not have alot of money to totally make the film that they want, but creepin is a total disgrace. It is probably the worse independent movie I ever saw. It looked like they just turned on a video camera and did whatever came to mind. Some of the actors seemed to be funny but the movie is so poorly thrown together it is barely watchable. They should change the name of this movie from creepin to ...",1017792000,,483,4.204301075268817
