Manuel Gomez Pereira, Spain, 1994

A non-Hollywood romantic comedy 5*

This is a delightful little film that abounds in confusion, starting with the title.  The apparently correct title is ""Todos los Hombres SOIS Iguales"", but the package reads "".. SON Iguales"" (which is what Amazon titles the product page, though it is *indexed* as ""..sois.."").  My Spanish is not good enough to evaluate the subtleties of the differing verb tenses.  Then the direct translation of the title is ""All Men are the Same"", but the subtitles make a subtle change:  ""All YOU Men are the Same.""  Just to confuse matters a bit further, Amazon misspells the directors name:  Manuel GMEZ Pereira instead of Gomez, so that clicking on that link leads to only one of his other films for which they similarly misspell the name.  (I tried to submit a change, but was blocked repeatedly.) [Edit, much later:  Hey :-)  I found an alternate way to submit a correction, and Mr. Gomez Pereira's name is now spelled correctly. Amazing.]

The film starts with a frantic prologue aboard a commercial flight.  The pilot (Joaquin --  Juanjo Puigcorb) is back in the passenger compartment, ranting and raving at his ex-wife, who is jaunting off to a vacation with her new lover -- Joaquin's divorce lawyer.  He threatens to go back to the cockpit and crash the plane unless they immediately prepare a revised divorce settlement.  The shrewish ex dares him to do his worst .. he doesn't have the cojones, she declares.  Two fellow passengers -- the architect Juan Luis (Imanol Arias) and radio sportscaster Manolo (Antonio Resines) -- talk Joaquin down, sharing their own tales of divorce or separation.

Brought together in this male bonding ritual, the three middle-aged nouveau bachelors become roommates (in a rather grand apartment).  They declare it is forbidden to fall in love, or to have the same woman sleep over two nights in a row.  Juan Luis, handsome, charming, with an easy smile yet a bit smarmy, has no trouble finding a stream of young lovelies, though he is caught out on the two nights rule and comes dangerously close to breaking the no-love pact.  Manolo still pursues his (ex?) wife, while Joaquin battles over child custody.

They decide to hire a housekeeper, and a pretty, but no-nonsense, young woman, Yoli (for Yolanda, Cristina Marcos) applies.  In spite of her outrageous salary demands, and insistence on extra compensation for overtime or extra duties such as pretending to be Juan Luis's outraged wife to hurry an overstayed overnight companion out the door, she is hired and proceeds to set the apartment in order.  Each flirts with her, more or less outrageously, but she fends them off, none too subtly.  A birthday dinner out is strictly business, charged for at overtime rates.

The (ex-)wives and children of the three enter the film (and the apartment), as well as Yoli's child and ex-husband.  There are many moments of outright, laugh-out-loud humor bordering on slapstick, but also more serious consideration of the difficulty of relationships and gender roles (with no one side the clear winner).  Not having a clue what to expect, I found this one immensely enjoyable, a light-hearted romp with a distinctively non-Hollywood flair.  Each of the story lines finds its own resolution, Joaquin's in a nicely symmetric replay of the prologue.  I look forward very much to hunting up Gomez Pereira's other films.
