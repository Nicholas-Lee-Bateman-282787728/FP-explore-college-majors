5664074,5,B00BPFPM7A,"I am part Irish and can relate to these three very different Irish short films; some very,very funny; one very very sad and the other very thought-provoking and eloquent  All in all, a winner!",1388448000,,192,4.647058823529412
5664075,5,B00BPFPM7A,"I saw this film on the Late, Late Show many, many years ago and really loved it.  Finally someone at Warner Bros. has put it on DVD.  The print is pretty good with no major problems and is clean and the sound is crisp and clear.  I was watching The Quite Man recently and remembered this film, made by Ford around the same time, and looked on Amazon and WOW! there it was.  It is a DVD R but that is better than nothing.
The stories are good and the acting fits each story.  The Majesty of the Law is a ""country Irish"" story with all the expected expressions (""Is it yourself?""  ""That it is"", etc) but a good story line of a man set in the ""ould ways"" and refusing to pay a fine for hitting a man who called him a liar and willing to go to jail for it.  ""One Minute's Wait"" is about a train arriving at a station for, as the title say, a quick stop.  The stop goes on for some time as the train is delayed time and again for different comic reasons while we see the interaction between the crew, passengers and station personnel unfold to comic effect.  Broadly acted in the Irish stage tradition.  ""1921"" is an adaption of a play called ""The Rising of the Moon"" and involves trying to free a political prisoner, about to be hanged by the ""Black and Tan"", during ""The Troubles"" just before Ireland was free from English rule.  Not a really serious look at the times (as Ford's ""The Informer"" was) but with enough drama and humor to satisfy.

If you enjoy Irish storytelling, especially in a lighter vein, you will enjoy this film.",1384214400,5,1530,4.2379310344827585
5664076,4,B00BPFPM7A,I enjoyed this movie many years ago and was very glad I purchased it.  Sent another to my sister as well.,1371168000,,105,4.0
5664077,5,B00BPFPM7A,A witty and moving classic perfect for any John Ford fan and/or Hibernophile!  The quality of this transfer is superb.,1369353600,6,118,4.9
5664078,5,B00BPFPM7A,"Absolutely a great movie.  Very Irish.  Humor is subtle.  Made in the fifties but I believe it shows the true Irish spirit of the time it is set in, from the revolution to modern time (50's)",1367625600,9,190,4.222222222222222
5664079,5,B00BPFPM7A,Yet another John Ford film which depicts Ireland.  This time in three short stories.  great cators and local talent share the bill for everyone's pleasure.  John ford knew like no one before him and no one after him how to immortalize emotions on film.,1367452800,3,252,4.681818181818182
5664080,5,B00BPFPM7A,"Whurra, and it's a grand film entirely!

How many times have I watched this wonderful collection of stories from my tattered old tape.
And now, somebody at Warner's has shown the good taste to issue this on DVD.

There are many fine people who acted in this, including Cyril Cusack, Noel Purcell, Jack McGowran, and Denis O'Dea.

In fact, most of the cast is from the Abbey Players.

If you like: John Ford, any of the above mentioned, and the auld sod itself,Ireland, then do not pass up this one.
You will not be disappointed!

Slainte!",1367366400,14,538,4.5625
5664081,5,B00BPFPM7A,"These three wonderful pieces were rarely seen on TV and were simply not available on VHS.  Found this by accident linking from IMDB. For any fan of John Ford , this is a must have.",1364083200,6,180,4.142857142857143

5664083,4,B00BPFPM7A,"I remember this series of 3 short films from the 1950s and have long wanted a copy. Black and white, and they now seem very dated, but still charming for film buffs or folks who enjoyed ""The Quiet Man"" and will get a kick out of seeing some of that cast in different roles.",1448236800,3,273,4.074074074074074

5664085,4,B00BPFPM7A,"This trilogy of short films directed by John Ford is informed by his earlier works set in Ireland.  Whereas ""The Informer"" and ""The Quiet Man"" were outright homeruns this exercise is an admirable but decidedly mixed bag.  The first entry, ""The Majesty of the Law"", is a whimsical account of a proud Irishman consenting to his arrest for assaulting his neighbor only on his terms.  The story here is funny but a little thin.  The middle film, ""A Minute's Wait"", concerns a passenger train that is constantly delayed is the most successful recalling the classic Ealing comedies with an Irish sensibility.  The final story, ""1921"", about an attempt to free an Irish rebel set to be hanged by the British occupation forces for treason juggles the dramatic and humorous to a mostly successful result.  This film is a must for Ford enthusiasts and for those unfamiliar with his work should check out his earlier films set in Ireland.  Noteworthy in the cast is the presence of Godfrey Quigley and Paul Farrell who appeared in Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"".",1437868800,7,1059,4.88268156424581
5664086,5,B00BPFPM7A,"The middle story, (of three) it is 25 or so minutes of Irish hilarity of a sort that isn't around anymore; A ghost story telling engineer, matchmakers, a prize goat, the bishop's lobsters, young lovers, old lovers, a champion Hurley team and a befuddled English couple make this ""brief"" train station stop one of the best things I've ever seen on celluloid.",1429833600,6,357,4.774193548387097
5664087,5,B00BPFPM7A,"I absolutely love this film! I have viewed it many times, and it gets better with age! John Ford, probably the greatest director Hollywood has ever seen, collaborated with actor Tyrone Power on this delightful project.  Power himself is of Irish descent and, although he does not act in the film, he falls into his lovely, natural Irish accent as he introduces the trilogy of short stories.  The work was filmed entirely in Ireland with an all-Irish cast, and with the loveliest Irish music you will ever hear.  All of it makes for a very unique piece of work for its time.  Whether you are Irish or not, this film will grow on you!",1425859200,2,632,4.517543859649122

5664092,5,B00BPFPM7A,"This is a comic masterpiece, shrewdly directed by John Ford, with Irish actors in three stories that capture the charm and, yes, the
beguiling mystery and contrary humor of the Irish.  Tyrone Power introduces these tales that those of Irish descent will relish even as they wince slightly at some of the truths they capture with such charm and style.  You do not have to be Irish, however, to enjoy this
film.  It is a classic, however, that, Irish or not, everybody will enjoy for its combination of grace, humor, and sly storytelling

5664093,5,B00BPFPM7A,"I love this type of film with different stories. Tyrone Power introduces each segment performed by the players from Dublin's famed Abbey Theatre. Pop the popcorn then curl up in a throw blanket and enjoy some whimsy [that's polite for blarney]. Only downside all films made in Ireland, Scotland, England and Australia should have close-captioning.",1403740800,,347,5.327272727272727

5664101,5,B00BPFPM7A,"I was once told that by the owner of a restaurant that I managed. I didn't get it at first, but this collection of three short films from John Ford, drawn from Irish lore and culture, would be an excellent explanation as it is done will great affection and humor.

8572257,4,B00BPFPM7A,"Very Irish and charming, directed as a labor of love by John Ford.  Hilarious and inspirational to all who seek justice.  Dignity and principle overcome convenience as we respect an elder who insists on imprisonment to the chagrin of all, including his accuser, his neighbors and the arresting officers.  A hilarious train stop at a rural station.  A hanging of a patriot, thwarted amid ingenious actors.  The three stories are introduced by Thyrone Power.  Alas, no subtitles.  Best viewed with headphones.  Otherwise, five stars !",1471392000,,532,5.176470588235294
