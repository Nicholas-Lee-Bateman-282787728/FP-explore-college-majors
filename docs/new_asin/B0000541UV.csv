1392488,3,B0000541UV,"I didn't actually get all the way through Kadosh. It's too hard to watch.  This is a portrait of human misery.  Too bad we can only rate the number of stars overall; so I gave it three stars, so nobody will in any way think it's a bad film or not worth their time, but still, as a cautionary notation that maybe this might not be for you.  The cinematography and all other aspects of moviemaking are here in Five Star condition; Kadosh is as well made as any other film anywhere ever (and I don't think this was an easy film to make.)  The acting is like, perfect.  Not a false note in anything I watched; maybe that's why it's so hard to watch, since the story pretty much from the start is just plain tragic -- and I don't mean sad, I mean TRAGIC.  I don't even know if anybody dies or even gets hurt, I'm talking about people who are just in a bad situation.  You just can't show a marriage of a woman to a guy who is off his rocker (for WHATEVER reason) -- an arranged marriage -- when you've seen and heard Yaakov her real boyfriend talk to her, talk some sense into the situation -- a guy who is SUCH an Israeli, such a good Jew , a real Hebrew who sat up all night sleeplessly in a tank during the war to save these crazy people from pillage and destruction, and here he is not-quite-pleading with Malka to ... do what's right?  It's not that it's unwatchable, it's just that ... maybe because I was raised Orthodox ... I just don't have the stomach -- the intestinal fortitude to deal with it.  Hey, it's on Prime so I can maybe finish it some other time.  For you, enjoy.  It's really a pleasure to watch even a little bit of such a perfectly composed film.  BTW if nobody else has commented on it, kadosh means something like ""holy"".",1442448000,,1743,4.170149253731343

But there wasn't much plot other than the destruction of these two sisters' lives by their religious community. There were long segments without words just to let us feel how suffocating and cruel their religion was. The best line (paraphrasing): ""there's a whole immense world out there...we don't have to stay here.""  Agreed. And I felt similarly with regard to my decision to watch this film. Some people like to suffer I guess.

Rivka and Meir, who adore one another, have been married for ten years but have no children, a shameful thing in the community, and Meir is being pressured to divorce Rivka and marry another. Malka, Rivka's much younger sister, has loved Yakov forever, but is betrothed to the radical fundamentalist Yossef and sees no way out. There is no way either situation can end happily, but the unhappy ways in which both end are unexpected. I would have given this 5 stars except for what I felt was the overuse of silence.

1392539,3,B0000541UV,"Maybe not so lopsided as a 10-0 ball game, as this movie does have some redeeming social value, despite a herd of inaccuracies summarized well in previous reviews.  It's too bad the picture focuses only on the follies of an antiquated religious sect, without offering a parallel shot of the secular world's failure to do much better in a Darwinian struggle for survival.  Or maybe it does:  a former IDF tank driver's sanguine memories of praying in his tank (what I would have done) are traded for the spiritually uplifting atmosphere of his rock band's smokey club (not exactly a place where even tourists should hang out).  At least he gets a shot at some really hot, forbidden sex, but isn't likely to be celebrating Passover with his girlfriend (or their family) anytime soon.  Although this picture is usually portrayed as the misguided attempt of an intellectual to grind his axe, perhaps it should be seen more favorably as a blurry yet plausible commentary on the sinking fortunes of a heterodox society, unable to reconcile themselves to themselves, much less to their enemies.  I changed my mind:  this game ended in a draw.",1371945600,,1135,4.849740932642487

1392543,5,B0000541UV,"I enjoyed the movie very much, and often empathized with the characters. It's not about only Jewish culture, but any kind of repression anywhere.
I agree with one very low-star reviewer that not all corners of orthodox communities are rife with unhappiness. Neither is secularism the magic pill.
Too many factors are involved: from biology, to history to technology that shape our social mechanics bit by bit and in unison. Movie can only cover a fraction of it. Art can never hold reality as a whole, rather it can hold a part of reality within a frame. Same here.
The director and produce did an awesome job depicting the sorrow, the social prison for both men and women. Don't forget the rebellion. The rebellion of the younger sister is not only the rebellion of the feminine, it can be a symbol of rebellion against authority.
To the end, we all do things for the sake of our individual interests. If the female rebel was sexually happy with her husband, would she eb rebellious? If the Rivka character were pregnant, would she find her situation unbearable? I don't think so. For those character, the conservative community was repressive no doubt, but not for all.
Yet, the theme remains honest: a soul always desire to be free.
Often our unhappiness has origins without, when we compare with others. Yet, none can deny the plight of the repressed women of the movie.
Eternal power conflict between male and female also found its expression in this beautiful work.
It deserves five star for its excellent photography, scripts and all actors were simply superb.
However, one forgets that not everyone in secular societies is happy either.
Watch it, you will be touched, and may also be disturbed a bit.",1364688000,,1708,4.812925170068027

1392545,3,B0000541UV,"Short Attention Span Summary (warning! spoilers!):

1. There is a community of Orthodox Jews
2. In this community, there is a man and his wife who do not have children in spite of 10 years of marriage
3. The Rabbi pressures the man to divorce his wife (which he does), after which we find out that the fertility problem is not hers; It's his.
4. There is a subplot of a friend of the husband at the Yeshiva and his wife and a Handsome Stranger in contrast to her Unromantic Yeshiva Husband
5. Later, the friend leaves her husband and the movie sort of just......ends.

It seems like the idea of this movie was to give us a taste of the lives of Orthodox Jewish woman and their yeshiva husbands. And it was good as far as it went. There was a whiff of secular hostility toward the haredim, but the portrayal was sympathetic for the most part.

The film tried to go into something like a dream sequence toward the very end, and that is where it got weird and hard to follow.",1362787200,,972,4.271739130434782
1392547,1,B0000541UV,"Much like many of the other commenters here, I am an Orthodox Jew and living in Israel. We have family living here and in the US who are of all streams of Judaism - from totally unaffiliated to ""ultra-orthodox."" This film is filled with inaccuracies, half-truths and many out-right lies. I found the most important of these to be the idea that life of very religious people is so utterly sad and drab. The loving, fun natures of the people and the wonderful, happy aspects of the life we live were completely left out. I don't accept the idea that this was ""artistic license"" because this was done by the director for a very specific reason. He obviously has an axe to grind against religious people.

I know 1st hand that there are problematic people in the religious world, just as there are in the non-religious and anti-religious worlds. The specific abuses by this film, by altering the truth to fit the director's agendas, are inexcusable and leave the viewer with confusion and disgust. The worst part is that the film-maker and supporters claim this is a ""rare glimpse"" into the world of religious Judaism. As many have found, films like these rarely glimpse into anything other than the biased, unfamiliar minds and hearts of the film-makers.

Again, this film may have some pieces of accuracy that throw you off, making you think all of it is true. Sad, insulting and inaccurate.  Even painful to watch at times.",1361145600,,1422,4.725806451612903
1392548,5,B0000541UV,"You may be  Jew or not, this movie should not be seen by anyone. I find it pretentious, inaccurate, filled with political tone. I didn't enjoy it, left with a bad taste in my mouth.
Not worth watching",1302307200,,200,4.2631578947368425
1392549,3,B0000541UV,"Firstly, I would like to address those criticizing the film for inaccuracies. Many of these people have cited their experience in the Orthodox community. If this is the case then these people should know better than anyone else, that Orthodox Judaism is a very broad term. Your experience may not be remotely like the experience of someone from the Haredi sect. Also, if you were remotely close to being as conservative as the Charedi you wouldn't be writing a review on Amazon.

Having said that, this is not a documentary. I'm sure some of it is sensationalized but, I'm not convinced that parts of it aren't true. Men like Meir, Meir's Rabbi father and Yossef exist in all facets of life. Ultra-conservative religious practices have a history of binding women and turning them in baby-makers. Those quotes from the torah weren't made up. The movie itself is interesting but, I personally failed to understand Meir and Rivka. I definitely did not understand what happened to Rivka at the very end. That turn of events ruined it the whole movie for me. The only identifable character to me was Malka. I gave the movie three stars because it was thought provoking.",1296950400,,1164,4.82
1392550,3,B0000541UV,"Having no knowledge about the inner workings of the Jewish Orthodox community, I was intrigued by some of the works I have come across. First, I read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hush/dp/0802720889/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hush</a>, a novel which touches on the abuses against children in the Jewish Orthodox community. I have also watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arranged/dp/B00116VG3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arranged</a>&nbsp;which explores the lives of two young women living in orthodox communities, one is Jewish and the other is Muslim. Though both the book and movie portray the dark side of orthodox communities, there is objectivity in the portrayal, and it doesn't come across as an outright attack against orthodoxy.

When I saw ""Kadosh"" on Netflix, I was initially attracted by the premise, which explores the relationship of a happily married Jewish Orthodox couple. Both Meir and his wife Rivka have been happily married for the past ten years. The only blight on their marriage is the fact that they are childless. This torments Rivka, a devout and faithful wife who feels it is her duty to provide Meir with children and she feels awful because she realizes that Meir is subject to his fellow yeshiva colleagues' disdain because he is unable to have a family. When Meir's Rabbi father insists that Meir take another wife, things spiral downwards very quickly. Rivka is shattered, and when a visit to a doctor reveals that she is not at fault for her barren marriage, she feels worse, but is unable to challenge the Rabbi's decision given his word is law. Then there's the sub-plot of Rivka's younger sister Malka. Beautiful and strong-willed, Malka has a secular Jewish boyfriend who was ostracized by the Orthodox community when he left to join the army. Malka's life too is portrayed as being oppressed and ruined by the Rabbi who marries her off to a brutish yeshiva student named Yossef. Despite being subjected to violent and awkward sex, she appears to tolerate her life until she hears of Rivka's fate.

Not being overly familiar with the rituals and life of the Orthodox Jews, I cannot comment on the accuracy of the portrayal here. What captivated me was the intense performances of all the leads in this movie - Rivka and Malka are well-portrayed by the two actors who play these characters, there is a depth of emotion that connects the viewers to the two characters and makes us sympathize with their plights. The men in this movie appear to be secondary characters,to serve as props for the women's stories. I did sense a strong and virulent bias against the orthodox community in this film, and I'm not even Jewish. On the whole though, this was a compelling drama and it would have been a lot more credible if the director had maintained objectivity in telling the story.",1295136000,,2905,5.299349240780911
1392551,3,B0000541UV,"I'm not sure how to characterize this odd film.  Technically it's very well-done in many respects, but the ending is surreal and for me, lacked any association with reality.  I like the camera work-- narrow passages leading to dead ends, bare concrete walls, crumbling mortar, all leading to the sense of hopelessness and fatalism.  But if you think this is some kind of revealing look at Hasidism, you're in for a disappointment.  It's more like a Frederico Fellini film on the Jerusalem Taliban.  Just add some turbans, and some long caftans and a blue burqa and you may as well be in northern Afghanistan.

If you like watching foreign films for the artistry of film-making, you should watch this, and if you are a student of the cinema. As a morality tale, the film is subtle and accomplished.  It has layers of meaning that prompt as many hair-splitting questions as a debate on Talmud.

I rented it to watch online and was very pleased with my experience, the first time I have ever done that with a film from Amazon, and so now I'm hooked.  This kind of film rental is really great-- however, it takes awhile to figure out how to get a full screen, so maybe Amazon should include some user-friendly instructions when someone pays to watch online.",1271980800,,1253,4.659090909090909
1392552,2,B0000541UV,"I do not know any ultra-orthodox Jews (I'm not even Jewish, but Hindu) but this portrayal rings false to a neutral observer. It is easy for secular minded types, who are unacquainted with deeply pious or religious societies to end up believing that life within them is repressed, unhappy in tone, and generally unfulfilling in any authentic way.

Do Haredi not smile in their weddings? Are no families, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles or cousins who populate everyday life and bring laughter, anger, gossip and chatter and noise? Is life so solitary and non-communal in such a closed society? What's the big deal with religious rituals, anyway? We all have our own rituals, secular or otherwise, from saying ""good morning"" to strangers to hitting the gym during the lunch hour, or wearing a suit to work.

It seems the movie maker has an axe to grind. Starting from a liberal viewpoint, he ends up with the most slanted, intolerant portrait possible of a pious, ritualistic community, dehumanizing them and thus forgetting liberal humanism's most basic attitudes which are a) a tolerance for other people and their customs, and b) an understanding that people are simply people, no matter what rituals they may observe or whatever forms their societies may take.",1237075200,,1263,5.038277511961723
1392553,3,B0000541UV,"The ending was the saddest ending I ever saw.

This movie made two fatal errors in reaching the level of horror that it achieved.

First, no man, no rabbi, no rabbinic court is allowed to tell a man to leave his wife for not having childing. It says clearly in Jewish law that it is forbidden to ask a man to leave his wife.

Second, no man, no rabbi, no rabbinic court is allowed to force a woman to marry a man. A woman can only get marry by free consent. Without that clear, freely accepted act of accepting the ring, the marriage is illegal. THese matters are simple and clear.

The rabbi in this movie ended Meir's marriage by revoking his marriage contract. There is no such thing as a marriage contract. A woman and man are bonded as if they acquire one another, not contractual promise, as in the common law. A man cannot divorce his wife without her freely accepting the legal and complication process to undo that bond.

Just as incorrect, the wedding ceremenoy in this movie did not show the act of giving the ring. I was hoping that she would not accept it. That is when and how a marriage begins, everything else is irrelevant.

By leaving out the two things that begin a Jewish marriage and end a Jewish marriage, the director turned perhaps the strongest Western institution, the biblical marriage, into one of repression.",1230076800,,1337,4.5041322314049586
1392554,5,B0000541UV,"A beautifully realized and sensitive drama, Amos Gitai's controversial ""Kadosh"" observes a little-seen religious community where women's roles are severely restricted to child-bearing and strict obedience to their husbands. Love is both triumphant and tragic in Gitai's story, the ultimate cause of dark disruptions. Abecassis and Hattab inhabit their roles with deep feeling, making us believe in their mutual respect and reverence for tradition. Barda is also wonderful as the younger woman whose need for escape materializes when her new husband proves incapable of warmth or tenderness. Somber yet hopeful, ""Kadosh"" is a marvelous Israeli gem.",1184284800,,647,5.75
1392555,5,B0000541UV,"Rivka (Yal Abecassis), Meir (Yoram Hattab) and Malka (Meital Barda) walk through the frames of Amos Gitai's ""Kadosh"" as if they were ghosts: human beings without a physical presence, without a solid place on which to land their phosphorescent bodies, souls and hearts. Their haunting unhappiness with their lot in life makes them transparent. You can see their hearts slowly break as they go about the business of life.
Set in the ultra-Orthodox quarter of Jerusalem called Mea Shearim, ""Kadosh"" (meaning ""sacred"") studies two sisters, Rivka and Malka, enduring the ironhanded restrictions of their tiny, airtight society. Director Gitai fastidiously features the endless rituals of the sisters lives: everything from how tea is taken to how love is made.  Then one day someone sends a note to Rivka, happily and lovingly married to Meir for ten years...but childless, stating ""A woman without a child is no better than dead."" And thus begins the forced and tragic separation of Rivka and Meir.
Malka is younger than Rivka and questions everything about the Orthodox way. She is also in love with a Mea Shearim deserter, Yaakov (Sami Hori) but is forced into a loveless, arranged marriage with a blustering bully: the scene of their first night of marriage is brutal and frankly disgusting with Malka's beautiful spirit and life force seemingly extinguished in the process.
""Kadosh"" is very still, very quiet, claustrophobic. The only sounds evident are the sounds of hearts and souls in anguish as they are being crushed and strangled from the inside.",1176940800,,1552,5.134387351778656

However, I am writing to express my disgust and devastation at a very different issue: Jewish Orthodoxy.  Let's just start by saying that there were many, many unimportant details of Jewish Law that the Producer/Director royally messed up.  If they weren't even familiar with laws such as the opening scene of waking-up rituals, then how much more so would they be prone to fallacy in their depiction of the real underlying issues that they were trying to explore?!

Guess not.  He was extremely rough on their first time lovemaking. (she was a virgin) It turned my stomach.  The ending will definitely call for tissues.

1392558,4,B0000541UV,"Amos Gitai sheds light on how stifling and confining it may be for some women living within a Hasidic religious community. It looks nearly impossible for them to live fulfilling and joyous lives. The film has a universal message which can apply to any religion or community which influences and advises its members in personal life matters that are, in this viewer's opinion, best left to be determined for one's self. In this film, two sisters lose their self-determination and are sadly compelled to follow the norms of the community ... just because they are women ... whose roles are proscribed. They are to obey the man and be dependent rather than self-determining individuals. The community is run by men who define behavioral norms based on passages from the Torah. The rabbi interprets how these passages are to be understood in modern life. The community influences the lives of its members to a degree most viewers would find highly objectionable and down right intrusive. Whether or not this is a truthful depiction of the Hasidic way of life is unclear to this viewer but the point which is crystal clear by the director is that some areas of life are *indeed* *sacred* and are no one's business but one's own. This is a totally compelling and fascinating film in how it unravels, unbalances and destroys the lives of an apparently happily married couple who are childless after 10 years of marriage. Both Meir, the husband, and Rivka, the wife, are heart-broken after the rabbi at the Yeshiva compels Meir to consider divorcing Rivka in favor of an arranged marriage ... to produce offspring ... evidently his ""sacred"" duty to G-d. It is not at all clear why *only* Rivka is blamed for this flaw ...

The klezmer music at the beginning and throughout much of the film proclaims the joys of life and its meandering mournful paths as well ... the sadder tunes reveal the future anguish of Meir and Rivka as they sort out their problems within the expectations of their religion. Sadly, Malka who is Rivka's sister is not looking forward to an arranged marriage to Yosef because Malka has a boyfriend Yakov who had left the Yeshiva and religious community to pursue a secular life. He sang a haunting tune in a nightclub about how love can not be fulfilled in this world but instead he will  meet his lover in the next one ... Malka obeys her parents and marries Yosef but her marriage life is a sham despite going to ritual baths to become spiritually more clean and praying as required. She follows her heart and breaks her sacred marriage bond by secretly meeting with Yakov for a tryst. The film shows Yosef to be an unthinking and insensitive man which is not entirely his fault but he is also brutish which again, he may not be able to change. He entered into a marriage for the wrong reasons - just as Malka became an obedient daughter rather than showing courage and breaking with tradition to do what is in her own best interests to follow her heart and mind ... even if it meant being banished from the Hasidic community. This film does indeed film less than joyful moments in the lives of its characters, the clothes and colors worn by the women, the older brick buildings and narrow passageways in the streets ... all are symbolic of a lifestyle which makes the insides of its members crumble and breakdown ... Who should decide in the final analysis of what is important in life? Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1152576000,,3432,4.680463576158941
1392559,1,B0000541UV,"I have no idea whether this movie reflects the life of orthodox jews in Mea Shearim or not. The key to my discontent is the badly told story. There are endless scenes of the camera focusing on a face, watching somebody during prayer or just drifting into space, and none of this adds to the story. I don't mind watching a long take of a face, if this face tells a story, expresses feelings, but here these takes seem to be to add time, so the movie can be declared a real movie and not just a short film. Large parts of this movie are even less interesting than watching paint dry. The characters stay completely flat and so does the story, which in itself is interesting, but not in the least explored in its depth. I endured to the ridiculous end, hoping this move would get better.  It never did. If you want to be entertained buy another movie, and if you want to learn something about orthodox jews this is not helpful either.

This movie is deeply revealing around an untouchable issue years ago. The treatment of the women in the ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Two sisters in search of their happiness and bliss in a system that seems to confine and marginalize them, limiting and reducing her gifts.

I couldn't determine if they were Sephardi (Middle Eastern Jews) or Ashkenazi (European Jews) - some bizarre mix in the middle - Meah She'arim is a primarily Ashkenazi neighborhood. The wedding was the most bizarre... . Perhaps the producers were short of money to hire extras. The whole feel was very unrealistic as a result.

To an outsider a lot of the context wouldn't be clear as can be seen from some of the other commentaries here.

1392564,4,B0000541UV,"At the beginning of this Israeli film, one of the main characters, Meir, an Orthodox Jewish scholar, thanks in his morning prayer that God has not created him a woman.  We soon learn the painful personal ""truth"" behind this bit of humor, as Meir and his wife Rivka get lost between love and the demands of the strictly religious community they live in.

Kadosh (""sacred"") depicts the sacrifice of individualism in the name of the common good, and the kind of resistance a human being feels in a world of ""suffocation.""  Rivka and her younger sister Malka are like victims in a society where individuals have no personal space or even persona but are supposed to act and think alike.  I don't think this is only about the oppression of women -- although the film does seem to emphasize that alleged part of Orthodox Judaism a lot, fairly or not -- but it applies to the men as well.  Meir, the scholar, is a victim of his fellow scholars' behind-the-back gossip.  Yakov is a victim of being ostracism after he became secularized.  Even the religious fanatic, Youssef, is a kind of victim, too, that of a rigid system which permits no individualistic thinking or behavior.  When he, on the wedding night, tells Malka that he likes the way she walks, he sounds like an embarrassed boy who doesn't know how to act in front of a girl.  But, in a masterful stroke, the film then shows he clumsily but forcefully consummates the marriage, in a scene that's both funny and shocking.

The film flows in a slow pace and in an almost monotonous way, which is the impression most outsiders have of the orthodox Jewish way of life.  The use of many indoor scenes further darkens one's perception of this ""other world,"" a world so unfamiliar to most of us living in the West.  There's almost a constant sense of frustration the audience might feel as the film progresses.  We feel for Rivka and Malka, and we also feel their hopelessness at times.  They are almost like two typical teenagers raised in a strict family: both want to rebel, but the older feels she must save the honor of the family, while the younger feels she must break free.  Again, it's not just the women: when Meir tries to resist the rabbi's urging to divorce his wife, and when he gets drunk one night and breaks into Rivka's room, he's showing a rebellious side, too.",1107043200,,2327,4.573493975903615
1392565,2,B0000541UV,"I watched this film at the recommendation of a friend. As someone who is a part of the orthodox (or ultra-orthodox as some call it) world, I was shocked at many exagerrated negative stereotypes of orthodox Jews that were main lines in the story.  I am not saying there are no troubled marriages, or narrow-minded, ignorant people in the orthodox Jewish world. Unfortunately there are, and one such family is one too many. But dysfunctional people exist everywhere. The problem with Mr. Gitai's film is that by depicting these people against an ""Orthodox Jewish"" backdrop he implies that the characters are dysfunctional BECAUSE of their religion, not in spite of it.

The story focuses on a woman, married for 10 years and childless, who is divorced by her scholar husband (at the behest of his Rabbi) in order to marry a woman who can produce children. The story proceeds from there. Another character includes the woman's sister who is forced into a loveless marriage with a crazy man.

The inaccuracies/misrepresentations are numerous. To name a few:

Normal Orthodox Rabbis do not encourage men with ""barren"" wives to divorce their wives. Rabbis do not place their hands on the heads of non-related women as is shown in one scene. Orthodox women routinely visit gynecologists and obstetricians. Many VERY orthodox women undergo fertility treatments. Women are not forced to marry abusive men, or any men, against their wishes.

Some may counter that the movie does not necessarily imply that all Orthodox Jews are like this, and I see that point. I also understand that ""conflict"" is what makes for a successful story. After all, no one wants to see a movie about happy people with happy lives. But at the same time, all too often, movies made about Orthodox Jews are made by people with little actual knowledge of their lifestyles. It's easy to dress up a guy in a yarmulke, show him praying and say there's an Orthodox jew. Other than the Chosen, and a Stranger Among Us, I have yet to see an accurate depiction of Orthodox Judaism in film.

As for the other aspects of the film, I have no comment.

If you do choose to see this film, I urge you to take it as ""entertainment"" not fact.",1099958400,,2191,4.75
1392566,3,B0000541UV,"There are some thoughtful and well-written reviews both at Amazon and the IMDb and elsewhere in which it is claimed that the type of Jewish Orthodoxy presented here is not accurate.  There are quibbles about the unnatural way that Meir puts on his garments.  There is criticism of the selection of prayers recited, especially Meir giving thanks that he was not born a woman.  Moreover, there is the assertion that orthodox Judaism does NOT require that a man repudiate his wife after ten years of marriage even though she may be barren.  Furthermore, the character of Yossef is said not to be typical of orthodox Jewish men since he takes his wife sexually without love or tenderness, that he hits her when angry, and goes about the streets of Israel with a loudspeaker hawking his religious point of view.

First, it is a shame (if true) that the way Meir dressed and recited his morning prayers was inaccurate, because such details can easily be made accurate with some research.  Certainly director Amos Gitai had access to many orthodox people who could have helped him.  Putting that aside, the artistic point of the opening scene was to immerse the viewer into a world based on religious beliefs and practices that are strikingly different from the secular world of today.  He also wanted to introduce his theme, which is that women in Orthodox Judaism, as in the other two great religions of the Middle East, in their fundamentalist interpretations--this bears repeating: in their fundamentalist interpretations--are not on an equal level with men.  Certainly in a realistic sense, Meir, since he dearly loves his wife, would have chosen something else to recite.  However, I think we can give Gitai some artistic license here.  The fact that such a prayer exits in the Jewish canon is not to be denied.

Second, the film does NOT claim that Orthodox Judaism requires that a man repudiate his wife after ten years of childless marriage.  Instead it makes the very strong point that, from the point of view of Orthodox Judaism, such a woman is not fulfilling her role in society, and that there will be people outside the marriage who will try to persuade him to abandon her.  Gitai's screenplay contains several textual pronouncements to that effect.  The fact that Meir is torn between his love for his wife and his love for his religion is really the point.  How he resolves that dilemma is an individual choice, and that is what the film shows.

As for the unflattering character of Yossef, whom Rivka's sister Malka is persuaded to marry (not forced, mind you, but persuaded) he is a foil and a counterpoint for the loving and deeply religious Meir.  The fact that he is not a poster boy for Orthodox Judaism is not a valid criticism of the film, since all religions have their black sheep.

I think a fairer criticism of the film can be made by addressing the question of, was it entertaining and/or a work of art?

Here I have mixed feelings.  Certainly the acting was excellent, and the theme a worthy one.  Gitai's desire to show the underlying similarities among the conservative expressions of all three Abrahamic religions, through their shared patriarchal attitudes toward women and their estrangement from the postmodern world, was very well taken and appropriate.  Where I think Gitai failed as film maker is in his inability to be completely fair to the orthodox way of life--his failure to show the joys as well as the sorrows of its everyday life which would help outsiders to understand why people adhere to such a way of life.

I also think that the film could have been better edited.  In the documentary about how the film was made we see scenes that were cut that I think should have been retained, especially the scene in which the omelette was made and the scene in which the mother critiques the life choices her three daughters have made.  Instead we have some scenes that ran too long.  It is a fine technique that Gitai sometimes employs of letting the silence speak for the characters, of holding the camera on the scene to allow the audience to reflect and then to reflect again.  However, I think this can be overdone and was overdone, and that judicious cutting of some of the scenes would have strengthened the movie.

Bottom line: a slow polemic of a movie that nonetheless is worth seeing because of the importance and timeliness of its theme, the originality of some of the techniques, and the fine acting, especially by Yael Abecassis who played Rivka and Meital Barda who played Malka.

1392570,1,B0000541UV,"There was a request for more factual refutation of the falsities of Kadosh--
The movie's premises are:
a. that Orthodox Judaism, which is based on the Talmud, is discriminatory to women, particularly married women
b. that the Talmud considers a barren woman useless and requires her to divorce her husband
c. that a woman may be compelled to marry against her will
I have been unable to find any substantiation whatsoever for either (b) or (c). Either way, neither of these practices exists in the Orthodox Jewish community today.
Regarding (a) - it is true that much of contemporary Orthodox Jewish practice is based on the Talmud; however, the Talmud is not as bloodthirsty as it is often portrayed. Although compiled in Babylonia c. 450 CE, the Talmud explains that if a Jewish court issued the death penalty once in seventy years, that court was considered unusually violent (compare e.g. modern Texas...) Although it neither adds to nor subtracts from the laws set forth in the Pentateuch, the Talmud defines the terms thereof so narrowly that some punishments are rendered quite impossible to give (e.g. the Talmud itself states that the death penalty for a 'gluttonous and rebellious son' mentioned in the Pentateuch, due to the narrow definition of such a character, has never and will never be administered.)
With regard to the role of women, the Talmud is careful to reiterate the obligation upon every man to ""love your wife as yourself and honor her more than yourself"", ""love your wife truly and faithfully and do not compel her to hard work"", and notes ""it is woman alone through whom God's blessings are vouchsafed to a house""... there are many more quotes like this, all from a document dating back to 450 CE! Gitai's seemingly discriminatory quotes have all been removed from their context. The first example of this is that Meir's blessings in the movie's opening scene have been rearranged to emphasize '...who has not made me a woman', which is a particularly cheap shot. The accusation that this particular blessing is indicative of discrimination has been around for ages, and it has been convincingly refuted for just as long. In traditional Judaism, women are believed to be on a higher spiritual plane than men, and so men have more obligations in order to raise them to that high level. The '...who has not made me a woman' blessing is made by men out of gratitude for their greater number of obligations. Women say '...who has made me according to His will'. Jews acknowledge that 'male and female G-d created them', both man and woman are part of a whole, and neither is intrinsically subject to the other. (...)
If Orthodox Judaism truly discriminated against women, there would be no growth in number of the women interested in increasing their Jewish observance. However, many women ARE becoming more religious; some communities are comprised entirely of the newly Orthodox.

Much of what is in this movie is completely made up, and the rest is taken completely out of context. It was made by a secular Jew, not someone familiar with the subject (or if he is at all familiar, he is very biased), and is about as representative of Orthodox society as the human characters in the movie Chicken Run are representative of humans.

I'm also aware that the Jewish religion as practiced by those in the movie are in the minority.  Even the Orthodox in America probably don't go to such extremes.  But the fact remains that in one part of the world, this is the way people interpret that God wants it, and even if the minority, it is still accepted by some, and makes for a fascinating look at religion.
These folks, it would seem, have a prayer for everything they do.  There are prayers not only for putting clothes on, but different ones for different articles of clothing.  There are prayers one does on one's wedding night.  And all of this is set around seemingly spending one's day studying prayer itself.
This, of course, is what the men do.  It is clearly stated that a woman's job is to keep a home clean, cook meals for hubby, and engage in her only joy, which is raising children.  They don't even seem to share in the celebration of the religion.
The director definitely has a burr in his side about this type of life.  These are not the Jews of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Yentl"", who sing and dance a lot to cope with their misery.  The Jews in this film lead what seem to be very dreary lives, and none seem happy even though they go along with it.
A wedding (and a wedding night) are portrayed with all the joy of a visit to the dentist.  The groom does not even look at his bride during the ceremony, and as soon as the glass is broken, he immediately begins dancing with all his other male buddies, while the bride is led away from the ""festivities"".
The wedding night is one of the most painful scenes you'll see in movies.  The bride laughs and cries at the same time as she cuts her own hair short.  The groom has his prayers to say, of course, at the bed.  Part of these seem to include a homage to his new bride.  This comes across about as romantic as telling her she has an attractive mop when she cleans house.  Their consummation shows that neither of them really have any idea what love and marriage are all about.
OK, it's extreme, and I've seen people scream that that's not the way it is.  That's probably true for most Jews, but the fact is, it PROBABLY does exist in the minds of enough people that it became the topic of a film.  And I do believe that this goes on.  My own religion has their cloistered nuns, who spend their entire lives devoid of stimulation.  I notice there are not cloistered priests, and of course these nuns will never, ever make a decision on how the church operates.
I thank the director for showing me this world.",1037059200,,3317,4.373572593800978

It prompted me to search for more information on Mea Sherim on a search engine and I found one excellent background article on a travel site.  (The inquisitive traveller.)

1392577,3,B0000541UV,"I had mixed feelings about this film but I think it's important to explain that there is a difference between the Orthodox Judaism that is practiced here in America (and probably most other countries) and the Orthodox Judaism that is practiced in Israel. There, it is the most fundamental type of orthodoxy that one can find. It is not imposed that a man must divorce his wife if she cannot bear children, but the pressures are very real. In America, if an orthodox woman wasn't able to get pregnant, the family would not turn their back on the possibility that it might be the man who is sterile. In fact, most of the events we see in this film would not happen in our society. Nevertheless, the misogynist words that men say every morning in their prayers, the fact that women are considered 'unclean' and untouchable during menstruation and so on, is part of all orthodox Jewish belief. Ironically, many of the viewpoints of women in the orthodox Jewish religion are very similar to those of the beliefs in fundamentalist Islam (thankfully, orthodox Jews do not castrate women!). I think this film has valid viewpoints on fundamentalism. The film isn't anti-Semitic, it is humanistic. Orthodox women in Israel are terribly mistreated. They know that to leave their community means losing family and all that they've ever known. They are brainwashed like all people who are told not to question their religion, that they would be turning their back on God. Thus, they take their pain out on themselves instead of their community. Many people tend to look the other way when one brings up the misogyny present in Orthodox Judaism. Would they do so if the tables were turned and it was women who thanked God they were not born a man and considered their men unclean several days of the month and so on? If one race subjugated another the way women are subjugated in most fundamentalist religions, there would be a major outcry the world over, but most people tend to feel that subjugation of a woman is basically okay. In the name of 'religion', it is never questioned. No religion is bad, but any community that does not allow one to question the rules of a religion is very, very dangerous, be it Jewish, Muslim or Christian. I find it sad that people in the Jewish community can't accept any form of criticism about a branch of their religion that does exist in parts of the world. This is not a great film from an artistic viewpoint, but it is obviously an important eye opener for people who have a belief that Judaism, as well as all religions, should be balanced and humane. If you don't like what you see, criticize those people who even allow the philosophy that women are inferior beings into their religions. Those roots are there, everywhere! As long as they are not questioned, there will always be those who will use them literally.",1024358400,,2846,4.682634730538922
1392578,2,B0000541UV,"The DVD interviews are extremely revealing.  The actors (themselves secular Israelis) love the challenge of playing fundamentalist ultra-Orthodox Jews and manage to convey a true pathos for the characters and their lives.  Their attempt to find beauty and integrity in the characters, and their sympathetic portrayals, are admirable but paradoxical, because the script is stacked against this attempt.  The writer/director makes clear in his dvd interview: Orthodox Judaism and the Talmud are, according to him, clearly out to debase women. He chooses the most anti-woman quotations from the Talmud (certainly using a search engine) and composes a plot and shallow fundamentalists to mouthe the lines. In the interview, he claims all monotheistic religions are by nature anti-woman [unlike the Greeks, Romans, Assyrians, Egyptians,... ???] and that fundamentalists are people too shallow ""to experience spirituality in the world without ritual"" as he does. He admits making the film as an attack on the religious right in Israel.
In sum, the actors' sensitive portrayals make the first half of the film truly interesting, but the second half is all contrived preachiness, ruining what could have been a balanced critique and portrayal of women in this culture.",1020816000,,1260,5.484536082474227

A couple that has no children must divorce? According to the Orthodox Jewish law? This is not true! There is no such thing in today's Jewish Orthodox life.
I am wondering how those people produced this movie in Israel (!) without even making a simple research on the subject. An American movie ""Stranger Among us"" and a European masterpiece ""Left Luggage"" engaged much more knowledge about ultra-Orthodox Jews than this Israeli movie! Is not it funny? What a shame!

1392580,1,B0000541UV,"(this is actually a ZERO-star review, but ... doesn't allow that...)
It's not often I'll say about a movie that it had no redeeming qualities, but Kadosh can't even be called ""blessedly short."" This movie drags on, two hours of anti-Orthodox propaganda (one of the sisters is forbidden to marry an observant Jew who joined the Israeli army; a rabbi rants about conquering ""them,"" meaning secular Israeli Jews; men go on and on about women's worthlessness without children, while the women sigh and moan and are generally downtrodden).
Another reviewer has said director Gitai ""holds no punches""... but I'd prefer to think of it as outright lying. What uneducated viewers might see as a compellingly authentic portrait of ultra-Orthodox life is nothing more than a web of misconceptions, preconceptions and half-conceptions about what ""that kind of life"" must be like -- as seen from the outside. Its only authenticity comes from its use of the Hebrew language -- and even with my limited knowledge of Hebrew, I could tell that many of the prayers (the wedding service, for example) were inaccurate or taken out of context.
Gitai's men are stereotypes, chanting prayers at all hours of the day and night, while the two sisters stare lingeringly at the camera as if to say, ""pity me -- for I am an Orthodox woman."" Feminism has shown us -- at least -- that women have the power to choose their own destiny. This movie denies that premise, denies the free will of all Orthodox Jews, denies virtually every premise on which true Judaism is based.
I don't consider myself an apologist for Orthodoxy, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll know (I hope) that I have a fairly good handle on its flaws... but it hurts to hear and see such lies about any of my people. If a non-Jew had made this film, it would be condemned by all Jewish movements, leaders and spokespeople. Instead, it's been heralded at Jewish film festivals around the world as a ""refreshingly honest"" portrait of Judaism's secret shame.
I am amazed that so many, Jewish and otherwise, have bought into it. Don't be next.",1012089600,,2087,4.8

1392582,1,B0000541UV,"Kadosh was an international sensation for the simple reason that it's subject matter is controversial, with some exotic titillation thrown in for some added measure.
As a secular Jew who lived for a while among ultra orthodox Jews, I can assure you that nothing in this film even remotely resembles the Charedi way of life. The ultra orthodox have a well-developed network of outreach and referral services for barren couples. A conversation with any fertility expert will confirm this. I never heard of a single case in which a loving Charedi couple had to divorce by rabbinic decree for any medical reason. The passage in Talmud dealing with barrenness was written in the context of what was socially acceptable at that time, some 1500 years ago.
I was also amazed at how little the Israeli director of Kadosh, Amos Gitai, knows about the intricacies of daily Charedi life. It borders on complete ignorance. To find a much better appreciation of the ultra-orthodox worldview, read some of the books by these renowned secular writers, who grew up in an orthodox community, such as I.B.

This is one of the most gorgeously composed films I have seen for years and I am truely stunned. There is not much to tell about the plot. There are seven characters .... mostly trying to reconcile their love for their families and their love for the traditions of Chasidism as they understand them in the very insular world of Mea Shearim. Regardless of what the movie is about .... and even if you feel that Gitai is being a little heavy handed in his presentation of the Ultra-Orthodox, rarely outside of Bergman will you find narrative scenes so exquisitly developed with such a minimum of camera movement or unnecessary diaglogue. The power of a single shot developed by the actors/actresses themselves is treated as a true dramatic celebration by anyone who can either understand Hebrew or is not too terribly disconcerted by white subtitles against a predominantly white background and other careless DVD transfer oversights .... hence the loss of one star.",984355200,,1145,4.876923076923077
1392587,5,B0000541UV,"This is an Israeli film that deals with the forbidden subject of ultra-orthodox Jewry.  Filmed with excruciating attention to detail, the daily rituals and total immersion in the faith are deeply explored.
The word ""Kadosh"" means sacred and this film is basically the love stories of two sisters who are trapped in this very constricting world. Rifka, the older sister, is sweetly in love with her husband of ten years. There is deep and gentle feeling between them and they take joy in each other.  Problem is, they have no children, and according to Orthodox law, the husband must take another wife. Malka, the younger sister, cannot marry the former soldier and guitar player who she loves because he has left the community.  She becomes the victim of an arranged marriage to a brutal over-zealous fundamentalist who I can only characterize as a religious nut-job.  The wedding night is horrendous and depicted with startling detail and I found myself crying.  I saw this film in a theater, and when I glanced at the woman sitting next to me, she was crying too.
The writer and director, Amos Gitai, is a secular Israeli and is clearly depicting Orthodox Jews in a negative way.  I wish the film would be more balanced.  Surely, there are people who live that way without the sad unhappiness that permeates this film.  Several years ago I read a novel called ""The Romance Reader"" by Pearl Abraham.  It, too, was about the restrictions imposed in her small Hasidic community.  However, not everyone saw the restrictions the same way, and there was a lot of love and caring in the community.
Most of this film was shot indoors, in apartments and synagogues with crumbling walls.  I wondered if there was even plumbing in the buildings. Other scenes showed the crowded winding streets of Jerusalem packed with traffic.  Some of the scenes were also a little too long for my taste.  But the director certainly did capture the anguish of these two women as they struggled in their own ways to deal with their lives.
The atmosphere throughout is sad and morose but I do recommend this video. The public knows little, or nothing, about this particular world; this film provides rare glimpse of it.",982972800,,2193,4.800531914893617
1392588,4,B0000541UV,"Selected to compete at Cannes in May 1999 (52nd Cannes).  This film is based on the French Jewish novel by Ilea Abackasis about love in a Haredi (fervently Orthodox Jewish) community in Mea Shearim (the 100 gates religious neighborhood in Jerusalem). Stars Yael Abuskasis, Yoram Hatav, Metal Barda, Ori Klausner, Sami Houri, Lea Kenig, and Rivka Michaeli. The film is a blatant outright protest against Israel's religious community and its treatment of women. the director is honest about his contempt for the community and expresses himself through this film.  KADOSH (which means Holy in Hebrew) is the third part of Gita's trilogy about life in three Israeli cities. Devarim (1995) was set in Tel Aviv, Yom Yom (1998) in Haifa and now Kadosh is situated in Mea Shearim. The residents of this nieghjborhood attempt to protect and insulate themselves against modern profane influences.  The rabbis and religious leaders exercise strong social control. Rivka and Malka are two sisters who are suffocating in this climate.  Rivka has been married to Meir for ten years, but they still have no children. Meir is put under pressure to divorce Rivka and marry another woman to safeguard his biological succession. Malka is in love with a man who has been banished from the community, so the relationship is doomed in the eyes of the rabbi. The rabbi decides that Malka has to marry his assistant Yossef. Both Rivka and Malka give in to the religious and social pressures, but in a very different way.

1392590,4,B0000541UV,"In a beautifully constructed but ultimately depressing essay on the endless pain and suffering caused by blind allegiance to doctrine and tradition, Israeli director Amos Gitai turns a relentlessly critical eye on a stiflingly ultra-orthodox segment of the Jewish population in modern-day Jerusalem. No, Gitai holds no punches.
Two sisters, Rivka (Yael Abecassis) and Malka (Meital Barda) are trapped in this male-dominated society. Rivka has not been able to bear children for her husband Meir (Yoram Hattab) and, according to a direct quote from the Talmud itself, a barren woman is no better than a dead woman. Malka, meanwhile, can not marry the man she loves but must marry the ultra-orthodox Yossef (Uri Ran Klausner) who believes that the only role women play in today's world is that of producing more Jewish men.
In a brilliant stroke, director Gitai explores the ruinous ramifications of such a belief system by focusing almost solely on the impact it causes to the sexual lives of these two young subjugated women -- incredibly sweet and beautiful love scenes are juxtaposed with one of the most repugnant and mechanical sex scenes in recent memory, which drives home the sad point that the only purpose of marriage is to allow cold, painful intercourse which itself is necessary only for the propagation of the faction.",978048000,,1331,5.110091743119266
