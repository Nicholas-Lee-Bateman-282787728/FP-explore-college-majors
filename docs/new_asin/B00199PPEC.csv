3430239,5,B00199PPEC,"I've previously purchased and viewed the first four seasons of Robson Green in ""Wire in the Blood"" and find it one of my favorites of the British mystery genre.  Only criticism is that ""about"" year four, and on into year five, more and more quirky little ""tricks"" and invasions of an aural and visual variety are making their way into the action scenes; as if the director/producer/writer cannot believe the story and acting will carry itself--in my opinion, a bad and debilitating decision.  Leave it alone!  Just tell the story and let Green perform his magic.",1220832000,2,562,4.833333333333333

3430241,4,B00199PPEC,"I'm a fan of Wire in the Blood.  I don't think I have ever been disappointed by one of the regular season shows.  They are stylish British noire.  It just didn't translate as well as I would have liked to a Texas milieu.  In fact. until I checked IMdb I wouldn't have sworn it was shot in the US.  It felt just a little off at times-- for instance, a hotel in Austen without air conditioning?  They tried to paint the hotel as a local low price no-tel motel, but it would have to be several more steps down the food chain before there would be NO air conditioning.

I presume we are also to believe that his car is from a rent-a-wreck place-- uh, that's a classic car not a junker.  And why is he wearing that sweater AND a suit coat?  And what type of bar was he at that they just put the bottle on the bar so the customers could pour their own shots?  I assumed at the time it was Tequila but there wasn't any salt and lemons in evidence.

So here we are with a character and a show I'm very fond of, a plot that is too simplistic for the character of Tony, and a villain that I could see coming a mile away.  But it still was better than a lot of shows and it did have Robson Green.  That alone can make up for a lot.

Anyway, if a newby like this show then he or she will probably really like the regular seasons.",1219795200,3,1317,3.958174904942966
3430242,5,B00199PPEC,"There are many wonderful things about this brilliantly unique episode of the ""Wire in the Blood"" series, which takes the fish-out-of-water concept and pushes it to almost painful extremes.

It's physically uncomfortable seeing our beloved Dr. Tony Hill out of his native soggy England (where he is strange enough) and sweltering in a Texas summer, surrounded by people who not only don't know him (and don't want him), but don't have the slightest idea how his mind works. Without allies, Tony doggedly pursues the truth in what appears to be a cut-and-dry triple murder when he begins to see discrepencies that no one else sees. The resolution is a little disappointing, but getting there, as always, is a fantastic and bizarre ride, Tony Hill style.

I especially enjoyed seeing America (even Texas, which is sort of its own entity) through the eyes of the Brits, and it was so well done than even as an American I felt very out of place; Tony wasn't the one with the accent, everyone else was. The over-bright lighting, visuals of fans in every room, and the sarcastic Texas-y music in the background gave it an incredibly foreign ""feel."" Extremely well done.

Tony is even more eccentric and unpredicable than usual, and even attempts the occassional joke, which is very rare for him. The setting of this episode naturally gives rise to more humor than usual, although of an entirely non-comedic kind. It is all the fish-out-of-water moments, the clashing of two magnificently different cultures, that make us laugh while we squirm uncomfortably for our bemused hero. Again, extremely well done.

This is not the best story, but it's a mediocre story told exceptionally well. A true must-see for any fan of the series.

Two things puzzle me, though. Why the title? And what DOES he carry around in that blue pastic bag?",1219363200,4,1823,4.88673139158576

3430258,1,B00199PPEC,"""Wire in the Blood: Prayer of the Bone,""(2007),90 minutes,  is a feature-length film from the popular British television series WIRE IN THE BLOOD, based upon the widely-praised  series of British crime novels,  by Val McDermid which are known by the same name.  This possibly free-standing TV episode of the British mystery/crime thriller series was distributed by BBCAmerica among other firms.

In it, British crime-fighting psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (as played by the toothsome TV star Robson Green,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reckless/dp/B0001WTUKI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reckless</a>) crosses the Atlantic to investigate the small-town Texas case of Darius Grady, an American Iraqi war veteran who brutally killed his wife and two children. Can Dr. Hill, who has been hired by the prosecution, show the soldier's defense of post-traumatic stress disorder is bogus, working in these unfamiliar surroundings? Hill has a previous acquaintance with the veteran: while he had been stationed in England at a U.S. military base near Bradfield (the fictional Midlands town created by McDermid where Hill and his usual co-workers are based), the man was charged with the statutory rape of a local 15-year old.  Hill had interviewed him, but before the soldier could be prosecuted, the military transferred him back home to Texas. The soldier is now using the same defense that he planned to use then, PTSD.  So, will the Texas heat, hostile locals, and a possible violent plot against him prevent Hill from making his findings?

The episode was written by Patrick Harbinson, based on characters created by McDermid, queen of tartan noir.  And what's tartan noir, you might ask.  A crime novel written by a Scot (duh!), darker and bloodier than the usual, but leavened, thank goodness, with that dark Scottish humor.  Can this TV treatment be considered tartan noir?  Nope. Furthermore, judging from this TV entertainment, the great days of British TV are gone.  There certainly was no money wasted on hiring a well-known, or a high-performing American supporting cast, nor any wasted bringing the British TV cast across the pond.  The closest we come are a series of phone calls Hill makes to his co-worker DI Alex Fielding's voice mail. At least we do have subtitles, for which, considering the cast's variety of accents, we should be grateful.

The picture was apparently filmed on location in Austin, Texas.  But this sure isn't a Texas most American viewers will know.  It appears to be a -- very hot--Texas without air conditioning, whose residents try to get by with fans.  It appears to be a Texas in which a presumably sane British visitor believes he can take a long walk to his destination, in the mid-day heat.  It appears to be a Texas in which this British visitor can, in a small town, find and rent a 15-year old jalopy of a car.  And it appears to be a Texas in which said British visitor or his producers can't afford a brief case; from first to last, we see him carrying a blue plastic bag.  Or is it just that he forgot his blankie?

Critics hold that even the boldest fantasy movie can be absorbing if it can convince viewers of the reality and truth of the world it creates.  However, as this movie appears to have been made in an alternate reality, it really, really, didn't absorb this viewer, or convince her that its makers actually had their intellectual and emotional boots on the good red earth of Texas.  It's definitely a no-go.",1364256000,5,3500,5.0680628272251305
3430259,3,B00199PPEC,"WIRE IN THE BLOOD is a fantastic psychological thriller from the UK. I'm a fan of the series and or Robson Green. I lost track of the show after Series 5 so I was surprised that there is a Series 6 and also a movie version called PRAYER OF THE BONE. Dr. Tony Hill leaves his Bradfield Police colleagues for Texas to delve into the mind of a man who has just murdered his wife and two children. Of course, when Tony Hill is in town, no crime is ever as it seems. Unlike in the series, there is no serial killer on the loose in this movie..just one horrific crime and one suspect. It seems highly unlikely that a police department in Texas would be calling in a psychologist from England to help them prosecute a case.

I thought it might be interesting to see Dr. Hill in a new location but Texas was not the right place. The twangy music seemed to cheapen the production values. This movie seemed like a low-budget film. I wondered if it aired on TV in the UK. I don't think this movie would hook you on the WIRE IN THE BLOOD series if you have never heard of Dr. Tony Hill. Stick with the TV episodes. Robson Green is a fine actor and the series regulars are a great team of actors. If you like a psychological police drama, you won't be disappointed. The Bradfield Police Department needs you, Dr. Tony Hill. Don't leave town again.",1311552000,3,1334,4.251968503937008
3430260,5,B00199PPEC,"Three years ago, I was hurrying into court in Caldwell County;  there was a man in a beige sweater, in the unbelievable heat and humidity, pacing on the sidewalk, talking to himself rapidly.  I thought, ""Oh no, another one of our clients.""  I noticed there was a film crew around the back side of the old Caldwell Courthouse, but didn't think anything of it.

A few days later, I saw the same person on a pedestrian walkway in Austin;  I think I glared.  Apparently, Robson Green is so good that he appears to be a crazy Englishman even all by himself in the middle of Texas.  At the time, I had no idea who he was.

If you're a Wire in the Blood Fan, you'll know why to watch this.  If you're not a fan, you should be.  However, if you're even a Texas fan, it's really pretty fun to play, ""Spot the location"" with this.  That I could count, they used the Smitty's Barbecue side of the old Caldwell County courthouse for the opening shots;  a motel in Elgin;  part of the Houston ship channel for a shot over a bayou on the edge of a refinery; the first floor of the Giddings Courthouse for a police station; the arches of a building in Comal County or San Antonio; multiple floors of the old Caldwell Courthouse; a metal bridge on Eskew in Bastrop that is usually closed to cars; a long, contemplative sweep of the fields next to 71 as you drive to Bastrop from South Austin;  the view from the cupola in the State Capitol;  Congress Avenue circa 2007, before all the condos;  even the Travis County jail, before the expansion.

This is a really incredible compendium of South and Southeast Texas film locations.  If you live here, watch it for that alone.  (And I'm sorry for glaring.)",1285891200,5,1687,4.383870967741935
