3791539,1,B001TKNWVE,I absolutely hated this movie. It has nothing to do with the book that the original movie was based on. It totally takes away the sweetness of the story.,1243209600,,153,4.310344827586207

3791541,5,B001TKNWVE,"While the second movie was a great movie, I enjoyed the first one more for a couple reasons, even though the story line was great in the second too.  While I am a big fan of Genie's, I felt her acting was not as good in the second one, more fakey.  She also clearly had a face lift and appeared in a constant state of surprise.  I liked her natural look better before.
I've watched the first one many times and just don't find myself doing that with the second one.  I'm still trying to understand why, maybe because as the other reviewer said it seems more like made for TV than a movie.
King was great in the first one as well as Kristine and Mandy.  Eve Miller was awesome in the second movie and I felt stole the show.  Overall both movies are enjoyable feel-good movies that I will enjoy for years to come.",1241913600,5,811,4.166666666666667
3791542,4,B001TKNWVE,"""THE NOTE"" was the #1 Rated Hallmark Channel Original Movie which stars Genie Francis and Ted McGinley as Peyton and King return again with the the sequel, ""The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love"".

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love"" is a cable movie that is featured in anamorphic widescreen (1:85:1 aspect ratio) and featured in English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  Whereas the last film featured Peyton everywhere and ths more location shots, you still get a good amount of outdoor shots between her and King but also within the storyline of Eve Miller and her friends.

As for the audio, it is Dolby Digital and because the film is dialogue driven, it's front channel heavy but dialogue is clear and concise.  Not much use of rear channel or  subwoofer audio but there is no need for it.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The following special features are included on the DVD:

  * Heart Healers: Genie Francis and Ted McGinley - (4:52) Interviews with Genie Francis and Ted McGinley about the sequel and having to work together again, talking about their characters and taking a chance on love.
  * Mother & Daughter - (4:12) Interviews with Genie Francis and Katie Boland about their characters and the relationship between Peyton and Christine.
  * How It all Began: Notes on ""The Note"" - (4:02) A summarized version of ""The Note"" into four minutes.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Note II: Taking a Chance on Love"" was another heartwarming film and for those who enjoyed the first film, it was pretty enjoyable to see the characters reunite again.

As mentioned with my review of the first film, it was great to see actress Genie Francis again in a romantic role that is not ""General Hospital"" and also to see Ted McGinley in a non-comedic role which he has played in for shows like ""Happy Days"", ""Married with Children"" and ""Hope & Faith"".  Both have good chemistry and the storyline elevated their relationship for the viewer and overall, it was a well-told story.

As for the 2009 sequel, I feel as if ""The Note II"" was more of a televised film, whereas the first felt as if it had a bigger budget and higher production quality, I suppose you can notice the difference in film quality and of course, overall location shots.  But bare in mind that the first film is based on a novel by Angela Hunt and had a feeling of a spiritual, holiday film. The sequel is written and directed by TV actor/director Douglas Barr (""The Fall Guy"", ""The Love Boat"", ""Designing Women"") who designed the first film but again, the original was very strong on locations.

But by no means am I saying the sequel is a  slouch because its not.  It's hard enough for a sequel to be just as great or better than its first but ""The Note II"" was an enjoyable film.

Where the first film was just emotional as it revolved around people who lost love ones from a tragic airline crash and finding love at the end, ""The Note II"" as much as it was a story about Peyton and King's relationship, the story revolving around the character of Eve Williams was just heartwarming and the overall theme is ""taking a chance on love"".

Now, as far as the DVD is concerned, the first DVD had two lengthy featurettes with Angela Hunt and the other with Genie Francis about her career and playing Peyton.  This time around, we get two short features and one summarized video clip of the first film.  It would have been great to have a director and talent commentary included with ""The Note II"" DVD.

Overall, for fans who enjoyed the first film of ""The Note"", the first was a nice nod to those who enjoyed the characters.  Granted, this is not based on any novel by Angela Hunt but I can easily recommend this film to those who were fans of the first.  Definitely check it out!",1241568000,20,3729,4.545727136431784
3791543,5,B001TKNWVE,"We romantic viewers cheered the wonderful characters played by Genie Francis and Ted McGinley and their supporting cast in ""The Note"".

3791544,5,B001TKNWVE,"I saw this movie on tv and then ordered it. It is a great movie as a followup on 2 families with diferent circumstances brought together almost by chance to develope close interpersonal relationships to unite them making them each a part of the other. If no one had known the circumstances, you would have thought they belonged together to begin with. Wished it could have lasted longer. Or maybe a sequel to growing older together with grandkids????

The Note movie trilogy has to be one of my all-time favorite movies, from the story line all the way to the actors who were chosen to portray the characters and the character development throughout the three movies was outstanding.

IT IS EASY TO BE PASSIONATE WHEN YOU FIRST FALL IN LOVE AND THEIR SHOULD ALWAYS BE PASSION INVOLVED.  WHAT MAKES IT HARD IS WHEN YOU ARE WITH THE WRONG PERSON AS THIS MOVIE SHOWS.  I LOVED THE STRONG EMOTIONS YOU FEEL FROM GENIE AND KATIE IN WORKING THINGS OUT IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP.  THE SOFTNESS THAT KING ADDED IN PROPOSING TO PEYTON AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO WAIT FOR AN ANSWER IS PRICELESS.  MOST MEN HAVE THE TENDENCY TO GIVE UP,  MAKE AN EXCUSE THAT I DO NOT LOVE YOU AND MOVE ON.

There was enough extension to the original story and change from it, so that it made for another fun viewing experience.  You have to like mushy stuff to enjoy it, which I do. I have found that even teenagers seem to enjoy the plot development.  I'm glad the follow-up movie was made.",1337904000,,367,4.367647058823529
3791715,4,B001TKNWVE,I enjoyed seeing the same characters back on this one... but of course the first one was the best. Genie Francis is good in about any part she plays..  Her and Ted McGinley interacted quite well again.. Makes you want to see more movies with them in.. The story was good but not as exciting as first movie.. But i would still buy it. Liked the ending.. A good wholesome movie for whole family..,1336176000,,394,4.324324324324325

I've collected most of what she has done and will continue to do so, however, found this movie less than appealing.  It had a great story but the cast's acting was stunted and not her best work. Maybe it was the actors around her or the director, however, I've seen both actors and director's work before and just feel that they could have done better.",1335225600,,418,4.2784810126582276

I really wanted to give it as a gift to someone as a follow up to the original movie I gave her last year (The Note). I was so happy that Amazon not only had it listed but it was December 23rd and they got it to me in time in-order for me to give it as a Christmas Gift.  Thank you so much.

3791735,4,B001TKNWVE,"I loved this movie and watched it as a sequel to The Note.  It was not quite as good as the first because there was a section of a few minutes that unfortunately had plenty of inuendo regarding proposed sexual activity outside of marriage, but was all words and suggestion rather than actual activity.  It was none the less disappointing and not as pure as the The Note.  If you are happy to allow that, you'll enjoy this second movie as much as the first one, but if you like absolutely pure movies with no sexual overtones, that little section will disappoint you, as it did me.  Some people are so de-sensitised to sexual suggestions in movies that it would be of no consequence to them, so this movie won't disapoint, but if you like things pure and want to allow teenagers to watch it, that one section will disappoint you.

If you loved The Note, deciding to watch the Note II will be a matter of your level of acceptance of sexual suggestion.  The rest of the movie is good, and the matters of relationships and how to go about handling difficult situations is good and encouraging.  There wasn't quite as much mystery to this movie as the first, but it covers relationships and commitments much more and in depth in place of the mystery.  All in all, I enjoyed the familiarity of characters in a sequel type of situation.  However, you don't have to have seen the first movie to appreciate this one, but it does add a lot of background, and for those who want to know what happens after The Note finishes, this will satisfy you.",1316304000,3,1536,4.457142857142857
