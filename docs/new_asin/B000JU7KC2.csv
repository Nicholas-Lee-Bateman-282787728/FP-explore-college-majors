8153103,1,B000JU7KC2,"Why would anyone pay $1,300 for these 13 signature sets when they can be bought brand new at half the price or less. These sets go for around $40-$50. Am I missing something here?",1212019200,7,179,4.294117647058823
8153104,4,B000JU7KC2,"If you buy all thirteen signature collections individually on this site it only costs twenty dollars more than what this Mega Signature Collection costs, plus there is some overlap within this set and with some other Warner boxed sets that could cause you heartache later. My personal advice is to get the following signature collections individually: Alfred Hitchcock, Bogie & Bacall, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Elizabeth Taylor, Errol Flynn, Garbo, James Stewart, Judy Garland, Katharine Hepburn & Spencer Tracy, and Ronald Reagan.

I deleted Henry Fonda's Signature collection because ""The Wrong Man"" is also on the Alfred Hitchcock Signature Collection, and ""Advise and Consent"" is also on the ""Controversial Classics Collection"", which is another excellent boxed set you might want to pick up. I deleted John Wayne's set because the ""John Wayne - John Ford Film Collection"" is much better. It has Stagecoach and The Searchers on it, plus six more classic films. The total cost of the 11 individual signature collections plus the John Wayne - John Ford Film collection is 510 dollars. Thus for ten dollars more than this pre-packaged set you have a much better collection.

My rating of four stars was arrived at as follows: 5 stars for the sets themselves and three stars for the value of buying the 13 sets together as shown. This averages to four stars.",1172707200,76,1358,5.058035714285714
