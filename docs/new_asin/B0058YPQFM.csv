4612596,5,B0058YPQFM,"Hilarious, clever and interesting. Excellent show. Hoping for a 3rd season. I highly recommend this show to anyone how enjoys dry/witty and dark humor and also has a decent interest in science fiction and fantasy characters.",1352937600,6,224,5.25
4612597,4,B0058YPQFM,"the concept is so oddball but somehow seems to work.  New York city is become so diversified that all sorts of strange and evil beings live open among us.  Zombies, bird men, talking trees, demons all integrated.  Because it's so out there it brings soooo much different and new humor.  None of the punchlines feel recycled.  The animation is also very basic and seemingly 2D  but again the humor makes it work.",1333670400,8,411,4.638888888888889

4612634,5,B0058YPQFM,"I absolutely love this show and feel that it didn't get the credit it deserved at the time. To me, the series is on the same level of creativity, humor and great timing as shows like Archer and Futurama. Each time i watch it, i find new things i didn't notice before or better understanding of the humor. Great show!",1461196800,,316,4.283333333333333

4612669,5,B0058YPQFM,"One of the funniest animated series ever. I have watched both seasons multiple times, and will probably continue to rewatch for the foreseeable  future. Having seen them so often, they've become for me the perfect ""background"" tv to turn on when I'm cleaning or doing something else & want to have something funny on in the background to keep me amused & entertained. UA is to Futurama what Torchwood is to Doctor Who. And, just for the record, I truly love all of those shows in their different ways. But point is, it's the darker, creepier, adult version of Futurama. Not really something you should let your kids watch - lots of moderately (occasionally extremely) disturbing sex & violence. I'm seriously bummed that UA only lasted 2 seasons because even after watching so often that I can practically recite each episode word for word like a Rocky Horror live performer, I still find myself laughing out loud. If you like the Venture Bros., then it's a good bet you'll like this too. (Although I have to add a caveat here - VB is light years better than UA. But since VB is, IMHO, the best show ever made, animated or not, drama or comedy, tv or film, that still leaves plenty of room for UA to be exceptionally funny). Anyway, do yourself a favor & watch. But be advised, you may have to watch several episodes before you really start getting into it. It takes the voice actors a few episodes to find their characters, and it honestly just takes some time in general before it starts making sense and you begin to like the characters & such. But I really think it gets funnier the more you watch - and I think any given episode is actually funnier the more you rewatch it. Oh! And since this review is for the second season, I will say that overall I like the first season slightly better, but in an episode by episode comparison, the 2nd season has a few of the best episodes of the entire series (the Twilight parody, eg, is flipping brilliant).",1446249600,2,1953,4.516949152542373

4613077,3,B0058YPQFM,"When I first saw Ugly Americans, I was a bit skeptical. Another gross animated attempt at comedy with its own unique twist, but I found myself enjoying the freshness of the situation more so than the actual comedic value ( which is substantial). I mean, monsters and aliens incorporated in daily life in NYC fits perfectly in the city's legendary aloof attitude towards almost anything. I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, however, season 2 is a bit disappointing. It pretty much destroys the character groundwork laid out in the first season in exchanged for a level playing field amongst the characters and their actions. In English, everyone teams up and the status structure that was evident in the first season is now gone. That being said, it is still packed with hilarious antics and jokes that made it very enjoyable, but the aforementioned issue that I had with season two kind of watered it down. In closing, season 2 still packs the comedic punch of season 1, but it's just not as structured.",1411344000,,998,4.808139534883721

4613153,5,B0058YPQFM,"I was introduced to this program via a secondhand DVD of Season One that I purchased at a local retailer.  I love the droll humor as well as the pop culture references (plus I love a good cartoon and monsters--so it's WIN-WIN!).  I burned through all the Season 1 episodes within a couple of days.  I was rather disappointed to discover that Season 2 couldn't be had on DVD, but I am glad that it's available to stream on Amazon.  A lot of the gags are visual (the head of the wizard's guild is Oz's frightening alter ego) and there are look alikes for a young Harry Potter (albeit he's 50 years old) and Gandalf (who is always saying some version of ""You Shall Not...!"")  Mark Lilly is the straight man in all of this--his half-human/half-demon girlfriend Callie is something else! Leonard is a washed up centuries old wizard who works with Mark, and demon-boss Twayne is so ridiculously inarticulate and inept (and always trying to hook up with Callie), as in at least one episode, he is referred to as unf***able. Oh, and I did I mention that Twayne's also a lame sycophant to Callie's dad?  Mark's zombie roommate, Randall, who is obsessed with his penis: has it run away from home in Season 1.  In a later episodes, he packs an extra penis in his motorbike.  This is some pretty wild (and very enjoyable) stuff, and not quite as frenetic as another Adult Swim cartoon series, ""Superjail"".  I stream these over my iPad when I work out on my elliptical (which works quite well, if I remember to turn off message notifications). :)",1400716800,,1533,4.545454545454546

Whether it's reading books, watching TV, or (most frequently) watching movies, I've participated in a wide variety of universes.  I can honestly say, I've never seen anything like Ugly Americans before.  Like all comedies, either you get it or you don't; but the universe is objectively unique.  It's a world where humans live with fantastical creatures and have built society around them.  In most related tales, the fantastical creatures always live among us in secret.  In Ugly Americans, an entire registration system is based around becoming a Zombie.  I'm sure some people will speak out immediately about their favorite book or show that has done something similar, but keep in mind that Ugly Americans is a comedy.  So no matter what material you compare this to, the genre alone will make it unique.

Thouh this theme is less present in season 2, which goes for the more wacky storylines, opting to flesh out the cast of characters that make up Mark's world.

4613453,5,B0058YPQFM,"This show from Comedy Central was one of the most intelligent and unusual series on ""basic cable.""  The writers took care to research the various mythologies behind the assortment of creatures and characters, gaining insights that made a strong combination of humor styles.  From the grossest slapstick to the most understated satire of social services in bureacracy, the plots and voice acting were sharp as a tack.  The animators also created small treasures of art to be shown during the credits.  These well-imagined postcards, snapshots, and other stills were not simple snips from the shows, but separately drawn souvenirs of the episodes, sometimes with additional material that filled out the stories.  My favorite was a postcard from the Meadowlands (NJ) harness racing track showing sulkies pulled by minotaurs.  Brilliant!",1379548800,5,833,5.4186046511627906

4613489,5,B0058YPQFM,"When Comedy Central began airing Ugly Americans I didn't even think of watching it. It looked a little odd, the characters were raunchy and the theme was somewhat inappropriate. Well all my perspective about this show changed when I couldn't find anything else to watch for free.

To make long story show I must say...I love this show. I'm just sad they will not continue to make any more seasons. It reminds me or real life, of people adapting to each other and others making their lives miserable. Highly recommend!",1378339200,,517,4.7444444444444445

4613513,5,B0058YPQFM,"Ugly Americans is gross, politically incorrect, irreverent and very, very odd. But ultimately, it's what gave the series its charm. It follows the misadventures of a social worker -Mark Lilly-, his demon friend and a zombie roommate (among other bizarre characters), in a world where pretty much nothing makes sense.

If you can stomach its sensless violence, innapropriate language and utter whimsicality, you will find a really nice series with adorable characters (who cannot fall in love with a murderous koala?), and very clever episodes. My biggest frustration? The series got cancelled after just two seasons, citing lack of funding. Hence, don't expect grandiose endings or an overarching plot. You'll have to appreciate each and every single episode as the illogical,quirky and wonderful story that it presents. Hopefully one day the series resumes, so we'll get to know what will become of Lilly and company.",1375142400,,918,5.3310344827586205

4613534,5,B0058YPQFM,"I love this show. It's in a similar vein as ""Archer"", but a bit more random. Basically, the main character works at the department of integration in New York City, helping various characters (from an East European man to a Robot and a Koala man) as they get used to life in NYC. The DOI is run by two demons, one of whom is the daughter of the King of Hell. It sounds weird but it's funny, trust me. They have a twilight spoof episode, and another episode about Treegasm, a national celebration of two treepeople mating in central park.

The main character, Mark Lily, is definitely not the true comedy focus of the show. He's more of a straight man, or a foil that the other characters play off of. Leonard and Randall are some of the funniest characters ever. Grimes and Twayne get funnier as the show goes on. Doug the Koalaman....Croatian man...even the more minor characters are hilarious. It's really too bad there are only two seasons, but man those two seasons are hilarious. I strongly recommend you watch this show. I know the first season is on Netflix, so give it a shot. It's worth purchasing, though, because you'll want to watch the episodes more than once.",1373155200,,1172,4.5545023696682465

But it's fun watching him try to muddle through, his girlfriend Callie is incredibly hot for a cartoon character and they have more chemistry together than most tv show couples.  The supporting cast is really what makes the show.",1355356800,,521,4.56989247311828
