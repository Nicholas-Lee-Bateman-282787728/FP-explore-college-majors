8162412,4,B000C20VZU,"This film is good fun. I especially enjoyed the opening when Shu qi is being obnoxiously sweet. In fact, nobody does obnoxious-sweet like she does. and later her comment on some unknown gentlemen needing a trim for his pubs while she hides hides her eyes from his shameless display inside a tiny little locker. Some of the bits in the middle were a bit dull and the three tall korean models were not the best. But overall it is a solid film, if all one is looking for is a fun film. Enjoy!",1412121600,,489,4.268817204301075

I love Asian films, and love action movies, and the reason I bought this film was for the good cast that they had in it..........but I found myself fast-forwarding through the too-long, poorly choreographed fight scenes, where I felt that the director thought if he put some loud heart-thumping music in it, that it would make it look good.  It didn't. The music was so repetitive in every fight scene, I couldn't stand it anymore.

In the film, the main character is an agent from HK, who follows a thief to Korea to find some stolen bank plates.  When he arrives in Korea, he gets a hold of three beautiful woman who have helped him in the past (think, Charlie's Angels).  I thought, OK, but all they did was run around saying ""Boss"" ""Boss"", and never did anything.  I sat there and said, ""they went to all the trouble of getting these girls, but they did nothing with them.""

That's all.  With this movie, I don't want to even waste the time to write a review about it any longer.",1275955200,2,1263,4.233333333333333

This movie passed the time quite well, I borrowed this movie from my library and it was the best movie I have seen in a month! You would be a fool not to at least watch it once! It was so good I added it to my wish list, and when I get paid I am TOTALLY BUYING THIS MOVIE!!! The story was great, it kept me interested and would not let go until it ended! The move is only in cantonese and mandarin audio, but it has english subtitles, but is well worth it!!",1260748800,3,552,3.8508771929824563
