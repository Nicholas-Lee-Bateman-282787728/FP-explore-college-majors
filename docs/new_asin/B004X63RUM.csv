4492177,4,B004X63RUM,"This film, although it was a B film, has a definite A message and might be good food for thought everyday. It covers the transition from poll taking as a source information to polls as used and misused by Lobbying groups.  Of course, to be dramatic, it has a fifth columnist approach but it's message is quite real and we can see what it was warning  at then in the late fifties had pretty much come to pass.",1420243200,,408,4.217948717948718

4492179,4,B004X63RUM,"Very interesting movie with much meaning for today.  The storyline is based on a sinister group taking over a marketing company and using propaganda and false statistics to influence the outcome of elections.  In this case the evil is found out and a Korean War veteran teams up with a U.S. Senator statesman to thwart the conspiracy.  Unfortunately, in reality the good guys never won and we are now living in one of the most corrupt times, controlled by criminal, self-interested politicians, where big money controls the choice of candidates and the outcomes of elections. It is too bad that more people in the early 50's and 60' didn't wake up to what was going on and put a stop to it before everything got so completely out of hand. Maybe they should have stood up for Joe McCarthy and others like him.  Of course this film was also made prior to the coupe-assassination of President John F. Kennedy.",1412812800,,906,4.679245283018868

Was McCarthy right? Yes!

4492182,4,B004X63RUM,"Dana Andrews, fine actor and greatly under-rated. This film concerns what might happen if people take over polling and how that could impact us politically, While this was concerned with the communists it actually is still very relevant. The character played by Dana explains how polls are used and how they can be manipulated in order to get people to support things against their interests. The very way questions are asked can affect what a poll will show. I think many of us are often amazed at what some polls claim people think, but do they? This will certainly make you think.",1401753600,4,583,4.7254901960784315
4492183,5,B004X63RUM,"""The Fearmakers"" is one of the most important movies about public relations that you will ever see. I ran across this film on free Antenna TV and had to buy it. The story is focused on a Korean War vet (Dana Andrews) who returned to Washington D.C. to find his previous partner dead and the PR firm they co-owned, sold to a man who was just an associate when he left for the war. There is dialogue about using information to sway public opinion (when it has clearly been paid for) and ethics. Wonderful film whether you are a public relations practitioner, or not. This film was made in 1958.",1385164800,7,592,4.390909090909091
4492184,4,B004X63RUM,"""The Fearmakers"" is a black and white 1958 film about political corruption. Ostensibly it deals with PR which was an increasingly popular subject in the late 50s - ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" (1955), ""A Face in the Crowd"" (1957), ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" (1957). There is also a subplot about the influence of Communism, which was also a popular film topic at the time - ""I Married a Communist"" (1949), ""Conspirator"" (1949), ""Big Jim McCain"" (1952), and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962)

Handsome Dana Andrews (1909-92) stars as a returning Korean War vet who owns a PR firm that has been taken over while he was a POW and presumed dead. Andrews appeared in over 100 films, including memorable roles in ""The Westerner"" (1941), ""Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), ""Laura"" (1944), ""A Walk in the Sun"" (1945), and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946).

Dick Foran (1910-79) has the face that everyone remembers. He was a popular singing cowboy in the 30s who went on to play in more than 100 films, usually as the second male lead. He worked with Bogart in ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936), with Cagney in ""The Fighting 69th"" (1940) but more often with good friend John Wayne in films like ""Fort Apache"" (1948) and ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963). In the 60s he transitioned to TV. In this film Foran plays a villain, one of the few times he took this role.

Marilee Earle (1934) plays Foran's secretary. She made only 6 films in the mid 50s and then married an executive from United Artists.

FWIW - the car that Earle drives is an Edsel.

Famed singer Mel Torme (1925-99) makes his film debut as a PR researcher. The ""velvet fog"" made a few films, none of them remarkable.

Look for shapely Veda Ann Borg (1915-73) in a small part as the man-loving wife of a drunk. Borg appeared in dozens of B films in the 30s, 40s and 50s, then transitioned to TV where I remember her best from her many appearances on ""The Abbott and Costello Show"" (1953). She gave a bravura performance as the blind pioneer whose husband remains behind at the Alamo in John Wayne's 1960 version.

Director Jacques Tourneur (1904-77) is best known for his work on films with Val Lewton, like ""Cat People"" (1942), ""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1942), and ""The Leopard Man"" (1943). In the 50s he transitioned to TV.

FWIW - this was Tourneur's second of three films with Andrews.

There are all sorts of problems with the film. The PR firm is supposed to be one of the major Washington firms, but there seem to be only 2 offices and 4 people working there. Andrews seems much too eager to involve Foran's secretary in his investigation and takes far too many chances. Etc. But the main problem is that the film doesn't have a focus. It mixes the anti-communist message with the brain washing and puts them both into the undue influence of PR thesis. Any one of these themes is worthy of concentration, but putting all 3 together makes for a confusing plot.

Nonetheless, the subject matter of this film is extremely compelling, especially in light of what happens today compared to what they speculate about in 1958.",1340150400,11,3071,4.618348623853211
4492185,5,B004X63RUM,"Great movie NetflixInstant had that I watched,I appreciate it's message,the term RedScare is a misnomer,It is a term coined by Liberals and dupes to discredit McCarthy/McCarthyism and Democrat Senator Dies(Who Sat on HUAC,Another Democrat Scoop Jackson was Anti-Red,the whole nonsense that Republicans were and are Redbaiters should be noted that we were just stronger,and with the exception of Sen. Dies and Scoop and some other Brave True Democrats. Since McCarthy did not chair Huac.)The movie brings home the point that there was a Threat(Still is,especially in the form of Liberalism and Enviromentalists.)and the acting and plot are superb,This is better than the movie Seven Days In May,because it shows the lengths fellow-travelers then and Now and their Enablers are willing to go. Instead of RedScare it should be a Movie for a Conservative or Thinking American should see.",1327881600,11,883,5.405797101449275
8446143,5,B004X63RUM,"Very rare a film go after the ""Peace at any price"" groups even and especially the 1950's when not a (for example and unrelated to this particular movie) science-fiction flick played out without a hidden or not so subtle message against nuclear weapons  and FEARMAKERS is a reverse sermon in a vacuum, beginning with a low-budget, rushed version of patriotism about as obvious as Michael Rennie leaving Earth following his Martian State of the Union Address...

But enough of all that... FEAR is no space movie or a Film Noir despite one of that genre's signature leading men from LAURA, FALLEN ANGEL, BOOMERANG, DAISY KENYON, WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS, and especially OUT OF THE PAST director Jacques Tourneur, who Andrews requested after the surprise success and worthy turnout of their second collaboration a year earlier (a decade following the Western CANYON PASSAGE), CURSE OF THE DEMON...

Our heroic when tortured after being captured in Korea war-vet Andrews has a horrible fake-looking beard in the prologue  and thereafter flashbacks  and it's nice to see him all cleaned up and suited, back home, processed by the Army as sane (despite reoccurring dizzy spells), ready to dive back into work  his own business: A somewhat complicated operation that has a big surprise waiting, and it's no party... At first viewing the plot runs in talky circles and depending on prior knowledge of the ""Public Relations Business"" of Public Opinion Polls, Consumer Analyses, Industrial Research, Census and Surveys, it really needs some paying attention to...

The movie does almost entirely through dialogue what Noir handles with guns and shadows, alleyways and romantic entanglements: After finding out that, while imprisoned overseas, his business partner died in a car accident right after selling the company to a man so obviously crooked he'd need a spinal shoehorn to stand erect, Andrews spends the rest of the picture figuring things out... When he gets word at a restaurant that his new boss may have something to hide, it takes two conversations with two different men  both very similar except one really gets the ball rolling, involving a possible murder...

The pace picks up later as the plot clears, and it's not Andrews, looking much healthier and somewhat back to his 1940's dapper style than most of his other 50's B-Pictures, nor is it moon-faced beauty Marilee Earle as secretary/inside-gal Vivian that truly makes this flawed yet entertaining programmer shine...

Musician Mel Torme as office dweeb Barney Bond completely owns his scenes, which happen to be the most intriguing as they involve either Dick Foran as the gentleman heavy, or Vivian, or both  with Andrews playing a kind of parenthetical cat and mouse in-between, knowing the business better than anyone and realizing those otherwise kindhearted D.C. idealists are being used as pawns (""useful idiots""), selling their own in-pocket politician through the manipulation of public opinion: Thus,  Mel Torme's Barney (foreshadowing Rick Moranis in GHOSTBUSTERS, only more mellow and subtle) knows almost as much as Andrews, and far more than Foran (aided by a big thug henchman), who uses the put-upon, spectacle-wearing underling to weasel back information  but what makes Torme's character stand-out also sets him over the edge, and in that, he eventually ""chews up the scenery"" yet in a wonderful b-movie fashion...

The dwarfish geek lusts for Dana's smitten Girl Friday, while feeling sorry for himself, with a shaky gun at one point, and don't expect a bombastic climax: FEARMAKERS, unlike most of Tourneur's more atmospheric, multi-layered ventures, is basically a Cold War Thriller's desk job. But how the papers are shuffled, as described smoothly by Andrews, is the key in this obscure vehicle that's much better the second or third time around.",1502841600,,3829,5.204878048780488
8446144,3,B004X63RUM,"I didn't find this movie as good as the other reviewers. I like Dana Andrews and for that reason only I rented this movie for 4.99, which I can't understand why the rate is that high, normally the rental rate is 2.99. I found the acting to be a bit sub par although Dana Andrews did well as he always did. The story is a bit predictable which is no surprise and not why I gave the movie a lower rating. To me it seemed the acting was just bad enough to be noticeable and a distraction. This is definitely a low budget movie and Dana Andrew's charisma just wasn't enough to make the movie a success.",1500681600,,598,4.119658119658119

8446149,4,B004X63RUM,"Very tightly-wound B-movie. And with a film directed by Jacques Tourneur you just can't go wrong. Stodgy in some spots, and the campy acting by Mel Torme and company are not up to Dana Andrews' standards. Fear not! Andrews plays it straight and Washington corruption is played for real. See this, ""Zero Hour!"" (Airplane! sans laughs) and ""Curse of the Demon"" (also directed by Dana's good friend Tourneur, famous for ""Cat People"" (1942)). Excellent Dana Andrews Triple Feature! Forget your Glenn Ford and your Tyrone Power movies -- this is the one for starters!
