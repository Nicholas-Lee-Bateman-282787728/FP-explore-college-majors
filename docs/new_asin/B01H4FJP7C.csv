7777079,2,B01H4FJP7C,"The movie had a few parts that made me chuckle.  Other than that, it's kind of worth watching if you have nothing else to do.  The Rock and Kevin Hart have good chemistry together but the script for this film is really not that good.  It's just recycled parts from high school reunion films and Lethal Weapon rip offs.  But, it's not the worst movie to come out this year.  It's directed by the guy who directed Dodgeball.  So, worth a watch if you have nothing else to watch but don't be in a hurry to see it.  Rent it.",1467072000,7,520,4.14

7777081,4,B01H4FJP7C,"Calvin Joyner ( Kevin Hart) had it all at Central High School...athletic, drama club, and he married Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Life as an accountant has been anti-climatic for him. He is contact by Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) who was the bullied fat kid in school, one that Calvin, a ""snack sized Denzel"" helped during his worst moment.

The film has action and humor. It is primarily a comedy. Hart and Johnson create good on screen chemistry. Could watch on tween family night.

7777082,4,B01H4FJP7C,"What could be better than kicking butt in the US Central Intelligence Agency?  When that butt kicking is delivered by two of the funniest comedians on the planet, the sexy Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and the adorably acerbic Mr. Kevin Hart.

SPOILERS---SPOILERS---CAUTION FOR THE SPOILERS

The plot isn't an over-engineered or complicated one-- an unknown Enemy of the State (The Black Badger) has stolen secret access codes and is threatening to sell them off to the highest bidder, meanwhile Johnson, Hart, and a whole host of comedic guest stars have to ferret him out-- but the real story is about the changes we all go through in life.  It's kind of a homage to who we think we are at the high points in our lives, compared to who we are when all is said and done.  The lesson is making peace with where you're at.  Like Molly Ringwald in Sixteen Candles (-wink- You'll see.  Only, to be fair, I could have said Pretty in Pink.  Or The Breakfast Club.  Or, just about any John Hughes film EVER.  The way this movie references a past some of us so fondly miss...-sigh- If you're one of us, you'll totally connect. A-whu wha?).

So strap yourself in, its gonna be a bumpy ride, to enjoy some of the best partner chemistry since Murphy and Nolte, or Gibson and Glover. You'll be quoting this one for a while. =D

7/10 for punching the bully in the face, tasering Ryan Hansen (finally! I kid, I kid! Love you RH), and leaving me with En Vogue stuck in my head for more than a week.  o/~ Neva gonna get it, neva gonna get it, neva gonna get it, neva gonna get it, NEVA gonna get it, neva gonna get it--NEVA GONNA GET IT, a gonna get it ~\o",1466726400,,1637,4.363036303630363
7777083,5,B01H4FJP7C,"Central Intelligence is a comedy based around an older story line. One boy Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) is an over weight bullied kid in school. Another Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) is the popular star athlete. Joyner was kind to Stone in high school while the rest of the school taunted and teased him. Fast forward 20 yrs and the roles have changed. Bob is now a muscle bound bada** CIA agent and Calvin is a mild mannered accountant bored in his humdrum life. When their paths cross again Bob is only to eager to to reunite with his ""BFF"" Calvin. Bob tells Calvin that he is under cover and he needs his awesome accounting skills to help him take a traitor in the CIA known as the ""Black Badger"". I cannot tell you too much more without giving away a really good movie. I will instead tell you I went into this movie feeling like the story line was played-out and kinda mad at my husband for dragging me out to see this in theaters. I was wrong. While the story line is a re-vamp of an oldie but goodie, it is Kevin Hart And Dwayne Johnson that make this a must see. Together these guys are comic genius! The way these two play off each other is hilarious. If you want to see a movie that will have you rolling in laughter this is the one to see. I cannot tell you how funny these guys are together I can't wait to see more of them together in future movies.",1466640000,27,1357,4.203065134099617
7777084,5,B01H4FJP7C,"Honestly, I haven't laughed this hard in ages. Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson have some really phenomenal comedic chemistry!

Johnson plays Robbie, an overweight kid who is bullied pretty harshly in high school.  Hart plays Calvin, the overall class hero with big dreams and a huge heart.

The two meet up 20 years later, when Robbie tells Calvin hat he needs his super sweet accounting skills to save the free world. Hilarity and action ensue.

Both actors bring their A-game, but The Rock does a fantastic job of bringing out a scared, bullied, soft-hearted kid who's trapped in a really buff shell. He makes you go, 'awwww' more than once. There are also a couple of surprise appearances from actors that will make you grin from ear-to-ear.

Also, there's great one-liners that you'll quote with friends. The writers did an amazing job.

I absolutely adore this movie, and can't recommend it enough! Can't wait to watch it again.",1466121600,20,931,4.860759493670886

7777177,4,B01H4FJP7C,"This mismatched buddy comedy starring squat funnyman Kevin Hart and charismatic hunk Dwayne Johnson is often laugh out loud funny and will keep a lot of people smiling. What the trailers sold you on was that Harts character, Calvin Joyner, was a nebbishy little guy being brought along reluctantly by an old school buddy, Bob Stone (Johnson), who underwent a transformation from High School goofy tubby geek to an adult handsome, brawny, confident CIA operative and who schools Hart as he brings his old buddy along on one of his capers. While thats somewhat close to the film, fortunately, the film offers far more than that. Calvin Golden Jet Joyner was the rockstar of his HS, and a good guy at heart. Expected to go far and voted most likely to be a success he was the opposite of Bob Stone, a chubby kid who liked singing tunes in the school shower. When some of his classmates caught him buck nekkid singing in the shower during a graduation convention that Joyner was speaking at the classmates took Stone and threw him out, all in his unadorned chubby glory, in front of the HS. While everyone laughed Calvin went over and showed Stone some kindness and gave him his letterman jacket to cover up with. And as they say no good deed goes unpunished as years later when Cal, still a nice guy but stuck in an office job that hes not proud of, ends up meeting old Bobbie just before their 20 year class reunion. And thats when Bob Stone takes Calvin on an adventure and its pretty fun stuff.

What made it more enjoyable is that Calvin wasn't just a reluctant participant but he keeps getting fed info from different factions and doesnt know if Bob is a good guy or not. And Stone is an oddity as he looks like the Rock but wears a fanny pack; he has a natural ease where people want to be around him and trust him but he doesnt have any friends, except for Calvin, who was never a friend but just someone who showed him some compassion once. Dwayne Johnson has such a great sense of comic timing and good-natured personality that he could probably sell me my own car all over again for twice the price! His character here reminds me a bit of the guy he played in one of the best action movies ever, The Rundown, though Bob Stone simply isn't as intense as Johnsons Rundown character. Hart does a great job as the constantly befuddled and bewildered and off-balance former popular guy whos now just an everyday 9-to-5 guy. Both characters are funny and likable and you root for them throughout. While there are some crude and not appropriate jokes and language for the pre-teen set this movie isn't nearly as vulgar as a movie like The Other Guys but parents who are concerned with elements of bullying, language, comedic violence that is still deadly, and vulgar jokes do need to heed the PG-13 rating. This is a fun one for teens, but especially for adults.",1502496000,,2862,4.514450867052023

7777302,5,B01H4FJP7C,"This movie begins with a lengthy flashback to the high school these characters attended together. Hart plays Calvin, also known as The Golden Jet. He was an all-around athlete, a thespain, great guy, beloved in the school, while The Rock's Bob was extremely overweight and bullied. The flashback shows us that when Bob faced the ultimate humiliation Calvin was the only person to help him.

Flash forward twenty years to the days before the HS reunion. Calvin is bored with his accounting job and feels he squandered his potential even though he has a great wife, good job and beautiful home. Then Bob shows up -- no longer fat but .. The Rock .. massive and sculpted .. and maybe not at all what he seems.

Hart is always funny, but Johnson is a revelation here. He is a blast. His favorite movie is Sixteen Candles and he is actually a CIA agent. So why is the CIA after him?

The pacing is great. Never a dull moment. Loaded with creative action scenes and tons of bit parts by great comedic actors like Jason Bateman.

Of course the movie ends with the high school reunion but even that was well done and hysterical .. and eye opening too!

Hart does scream a lot, and some people may not like that, but I thought the movie worked from start to finish, and cannot wait for the sequel. I've seen it three times this year and am buying a copy!",1487376000,,1345,4.407258064516129

7777358,3,B01H4FJP7C,"Two problems with this movie.  1) It's funny, but I really expected it to be funnier.  It seems like some of the scenes worked better in the ads vs in context of the movie.  The beginning of the movie is a good example.  Instead of being able to laugh at Dwayne Johnson's character, you can't laugh because you feel humiliated for him.  2) I didn't know this movie was a remake.  It didn't take very long before I realized this was a remake of The In-Laws.  Dwayne Johnson is the Peter Falk Character and Kevin Hart is Alan Arkin.  If you haven't seen that movie, you would probably enjoy Central Intelligence more.  That movie is better, and once you realize it's a remake, you know exactly where everything is headed.",1484524800,,719,4.469230769230769

7777361,3,B01H4FJP7C,"The Rock and Kevin Hart pair up as a set of dysfunctional high school acquaintances who embark on a quest for gunfights and fireballs on the eve of their high school reunion. The leading duo has a great rapport, funny without feeling forced, and it's a good thing because that's where all the magic lies; the plot is flimsy as all get-out. I understand, it's important not to overthink a dumb buddy comedy, and Central Intelligence brings a lot of amusing, brainless fun to the table. Sometimes it pushes a bit too far, though, and that's tough to look past. I'm talking about the watery acting (when they aren't ad-libbing, the two leads ham it up like a Christmas dinner), terribly awkward music decisions (shoehorned to fit the late '90s theme) and downright awful effects work (The Rock's face superimposed over a heavy-set teen is especially bad). There's enough meat here to merit another adventure with these guys - their social media promo clips for the film show they've got compatibility in spades - but next time let's aim for something a bit less trashy and lightweight.",1484265600,,1082,4.791443850267379

7777542,5,B01H4FJP7C,"Its rare that a movie lives up to a great trailer used to promote it. When a movie surpasses the trailer its cause to celebrate. Such is the case with the release of CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE to DVD. The trailer had me laughing out loud when I saw it prior to the film coming out. The movie just added more laughs.

The film opens in 1996 at a high school pep rally with a special effected Dwight The Rock Johnson stars as Robbie, the fat kid in high school everyone picks on. This in itself is hilarious and actually plays into the story. The most popular kid in school is Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) who is being celebrated at the rally when the school bullies toss Robbie out to the gym floor sans clothes. Calvin feels for him and gives Robbie his letter jacket to cover up with.

Fast forward to the present. Calvin now works as an accountant. The student most likely to succeed isn't doing near as well as hed hoped. His prot&eacute;g&eacute; has surpassed him and gotten a new promotion. Rather than moving up, hes stagnated or even slid down a notch or two. His high school sweetheart/wife on the other hand is a partner at her law firm. Life has not been kind to Calvin.

Then the day before the class reunion he gets a friend request on Facebook. He accepts only to find the person now known at Bob Stone is actually Robbie. He agrees to meet with him for drinks and is stunned to discover Robbie has changed into the body building good looking guy in front of him. A confrontation with 4 bad guys in the bar results in Robbie taking them out with ease and impressing Calvin.

Robbie asks Calvin for help with a minor problem concerning his payroll account at work. Instead Calvin finds a secret bidding war going on for something that ends in 14 hours. Robbie ropes Calvin into letting him spend the night but the next morning the CIA shows up at Calvins doorstep searching for Bob. It turns out hes a CIA operative they think killed his partner and stole secret documents now being sold online.

Escorted to work Calvin thinks hes safe now only to find Bob there waiting for him after he tricks the CIA agents looking for him off Calvins floor. Telling him its a set up and asking for his help, Bob recruits Calvin half against his will and the duo is off and running trying to avoid the CIA and still discover who the traitor is and where the sale will go down. Or is that the case? Could it be that Bob is actually the seller, a killer who is just using Calvin?

The movie captures the best elements of the buddy movies from the past with two likeable characters who blend together seamlessly onscreen. Hart has been funny in nearly everything Ive seen him but Johnson has only had a few opportunities to display a talent for comedy. He shines here as Bob, both in and out of CGI mode. While Hart has plenty of humorous moments Johnson equals him in that department. In return Hart gets the opportunity to live out some action moves as well.

The movie not only tells the story at hand but delves into the other topics as well, mainly bullying and the effect it has on a person. While Robbie went off and turned himself into Bob the torment he took in high school left its scars on him as displayed when he faces the old school bully. And while hes the one with the heroic good looks and skills it is actually Calvin who displays the truest traits of a hero, the knowledge to do the right thing when Robbie is humiliated at the start of the film and learning to trust the man who considers him a better friend than anyone hes had.

Plenty of action keeps the pace of the film running. The plot felt simple for me to figure out before the final reel. The humor kept me laughing from start to finish. When the film ends there are some edited scenes on hand to show these two were having far too much fun filming this movie. All it left me hoping was that the pair would team up for more movies in the future. That seems to be the case as they are currently working on the reworking of JUMANJI together. Lets just hope that Johnson gets the chance to do as much comedy as action films and that Hart is there with him in each and every one.",1479772800,,4144,4.310654685494224

I'm used to seeing Dwayne as the larger-than-life hero and Kevin as a smart-talking comedian, but together they were fabulous.  Danielle Nicolet was great as Kevin's wife.  Her reactions to his odd behavior was priceless.  Being a comedy, you did have to suspend disbelief.  Dwayne's character had deep psychological problems due to being bullied in high school.  And he became a CIA agent.  That's bothersome in that you hear about agents being people who have disassociated from society.  That they make the best killers.  So, that part wasn't funny to me.

7777574,3,B01H4FJP7C,"For me Central Intelligence just took too long to kick into gear and get going.  Dwayne Johnson for the first half hour or so wearing a unicorn t-shirt and a bumbag, making former high school cool kid now twenty years later stuck in a mundane life somewhat uncomfortable with the fact that maybe his new Facebook friend, who he is somewhat afraid of due to his size ,might be expecting to be more than friends, this first part of the movie never really decided if it wanted to go there or was afraid of the backlash if it did so just becomes sort of filler viewing with the storyline spinning its wheels and going nowhere.  Once Kevin Hart's character learns Johnson's may be either a terrorist, or a good guy being framed, and just wants out of the new companionship, the movie does become a lot better, with occasional laughs every now and then, and somewhat interesting fight scenes, although nothing we haven't seen countless times before in other movies with the same scenario plot.

7777599,4,B01H4FJP7C,"Where the film starts -
Twenty years ago (1996) 'Calvin Joiner' (Kevin Hart) known at high-school by his fellow studends as the much admired 'Golden-Jet'
was always seen as the one student most likely to succeed in life, at a senior assembly he is honoured as such...
While 'Robbie Weirdicht' (Dwayne Johnson) was the subject of ridicule, bullied by many, at the same ceromy he is uncerimoniously
hurled into the hall naked after being dragged from showering.
Since when 'Calvin' married the school beauty 'Maggie' (Danniele Nicolet) and has in fact gone-on to lead a very mundane life working
as an accountant.
At work he gets a e-mail from a 'Bob Stone' which 'Robbie' now calls himself wanting to meet up, well, out of curioisity rather than having
been a friend 'alvin' agree's....much to his surprise the fat no-hoper he remembers has now become  a muscle-bound babe magnet.
After an inteesting and enjoyable (in the main) evening it turns out that 'Bob' who had become a C.I.A agent is in need of help, he is
being pursued by agent 'Pamela Harris' (Amy Ryan) and her team, they believe not only that 'Bob' (Calvin) killed his partner 'Phil Stanton'
but is also the criminal known as 'The Black Badger' who is attempting to sell classified codes.
Well, unwittingly 'Calvin' gets caught up in the chaos, and finds himself in car-chases and being shot-at....'Bob' of course insists that he
has been set-up and needs to hunt down the real 'Black Badger' in order to prove his innocence....
It all becomes confusing for 'Calvin' he's really unsure of who to believe or indeed trust, when his wife 'Maggie' becomes a possible
innocent about to become involved, he decides he'll have to give 'Bob' (Calvin) up to the authorities........however when the chips are
down will he let-down 'Bob' (Calvin) who had told him that he'd been the only person at high-school to have shown him any kindness.
This a very odd-ball comedy with a pretty silly plot, however, in truth, it works and is indeed an enjoyable watch.
New-Best-Friends  ?
Whilst 'Kevin Hart' is often associated with comedy roles, 'Dwayne Johnson' though having played one or two ligt-hearted parts dow
the years is perhaps better known for his action-hero roles and indeed as wrestling-legend 'The Rock' ...should maybe take on more
parts of this kind...he's a natural.

7777600,5,B01H4FJP7C,"Just flat out hilarious & heart-warming. Yes, a lot of gunfire but it's all done in such a slapstick, cartoonish way that it's not scary. Dwayne Johnson/the Rock plays (in a fat suit) a fat-shaming, bullied teen who changes his name to Bob Stone. Kevin Hart plays the King of the Campus in high school. Danielle Nicoli is his high school sweetheart/wife 20 years later. Jason Bateman is the grown up bully (still a bully) (Dylan Boylack was Trevor the bully as a teen). All do such great work
Amy Ryan leads a team of CIA agents chashing Bob Stone (the Roc). It is a mass of laughter, my husband & I love just absurd comedy & this took the cake. We quite literally laughed throughout the entire film.
After one wild chase/ride/flight after another, everyone ends up at the 20th year reunion. Here, people are shocked at the transformation of fat kid to rock hard, worked out Bob Stone. All the loose ends are tied up, bully put in his place, happy ending. And you will be surprised at who plays Bob Stone's high school sweet heart. What fun!
What I love about Dwayne Johnson is his ability to emote as a shamed, sad, lonely kid inside the outrageously toned body he has. He is a real actor & a comedic genius, as is Hart. Do watch this, it is brilliant fun.",1478390400,,1257,4.399141630901288

After he reconnects with an awkward pal from high school through Facebook, a mild-mannered accountant is lured into the world of international espionage.

This is a highly hilarious action comedy, one of the best this year, an amazing cast of actors, Kevin Hart is no stranger to buddy comedies with the ride along series, he's a naturally funny comedian and actor, he plays well along side Dwayne Johnson who for an action muscle bound star is quite good at being funny too, both stars work well together to deliver great laugh out loud moments throughout. Its an all round good blend of action and laughs, if your a fan of these actors then this is a must watch a very entertaining movie from beginning to end, the soundtrack is cool too with plenty of old school tunes.

7777626,5,B01H4FJP7C,"I will admit that when The Rock first started acting, I thought his acting career would go down in flames within a few years. He'd headline some action flicks and wear out his welcome to never be heard from again. The first time I saw him act was in ""Get Smart,"" which I found to be hilarious mostly due to Steve Carell. Later, I saw ""San Andreas"" and was impressed how he carried the entire movie. Then I saw ""Central Intelligence,"" and he became my hero. As soon as his character stepped on screen, I couldn't get enough of him. I always knew Kevin Hart was funny, but Johnson was a revelation to me. He didn't deliver many punch lines in ""Get Smart"" and mostly played the 'straight' character when Anne Hathaway wasn't there, so going into this I can safely say that I was not expecting his performance here.

Action movies tend to be heavy on the plot and light on the characters, but here it's the exact opposite. The plot exists to give the characters material. As for Johnson's character (and Hart's for that matter), I think it's best to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. And that's where I will leave you; Dwayne Johnson gives one of the funniest performances of this and many other years, and the movie is energetic enough to keep you engaged.

Note: I watched the Unrated version, not the theatrical one. I don't think that other than a dozen or so f-bombs that there is much difference between the two cuts. It's kind of sad in America that the number of times you say the f-word can dramatically affect a movie's performance in the box office. Who the hell goes into a movie and says, ""It was OK for them to use the f-word twice, but three or more times? That was just too much!""?",1477785600,,1709,4.405063291139241
7777627,4,B01H4FJP7C,"On the surface this is a fairly routine cloak-and-dagger comedy.  The novelty of ""Central Intelligence"" is the role reversal in the casting.  In a change of pace it's Kevin Hart playing straight man to a normally stoic Dwayne Johnson.  Johnson is quite good as the funnyman giving dimension to his nerdy character while Hart responds with hilarious comic exasperation.  I can imagine Johnson's role being played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in his heyday.  Jason Bateman has a terrific bit as Johnson's high school tormentor.

Later the Rock looks him up for his friendship and his skills. The Rock plays an awesome and kick aas nerdy kind of guy who is big on humility and kindness.

7777663,3,B01H4FJP7C,"This is a pretty good movie with a lot of humor and a reasonable story line.  Dwayne Johnson does a pretty good job with humor and the expected tough guy scenes.  I will watch this movie again and again over time.  The negative for me is that the lead lady agent in charge of the CIA team that is after Dwayne throughout the movie is unrealistically blind to what is going on.  In her mind, there is no room for doubt that Dwayne is a rogue agent and a very bad guy.  I did not find her rather nasty approach  as being believable.  The story line is similar to the movie Knight and Day with Tom Cruise, but in that movie, the lead lady agent, who is equally convinced that Tom Cruise is a rogue agent gone bad, plays a much more believable role.  But I loved Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart.  Kevin Hart demonstrates good acting as the school superstar expected to go far but doesn't, and through the movie, he gradually discovers himself and his own success in life.  There is a love story between Kevin Hart and his wife/school sweetheart that develops nicely, but this is a secondary plot through the movie.  I give this 3 stars, which might be a bit harsh, because I was constantly exposed to the unreasonable attitude of the lead lady agent.",1476576000,4,1244,4.3652173913043475

7777683,4,B01H4FJP7C,"I was somewhat apprehensive when I first viewed this movie, but happily it turned out to be one of the funniest DVD movies I have seen lately. This film stars Dwaine Johnson, who I really like and the comic sensation Kevin Hart.  The story begins with Dwaine and Kevin in high school where, if you believe it, Dwaine is a big fat nerd and made fun of and Keven Hart is the big hero and most likely to succeed character.  After many years pass where Keven Hart has become an accountant and Dwaine Johnson is now in the Central intelligence agency.

I never like to give away too much information when reviewing a movie or novel but I will say I found this to be a very entertaining and humorous movie.  You may want to check out this DVD if you are a fan of Dwaine Johnson and Keven Hart.

7777707,3,B01H4FJP7C,"Central Intelligence is an action comedy starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson. The story begins in 1996 when Calvin Joyner (Hart) is big man on campus at his high school. Though Calvin is popular with everyone, he makes a particular fan in Robbie Weirdicht (Johnson), an overweight, bullied boy who is thrown naked in front of the entire school during an assembly. Pitying the helpless victim, Calvin gives Robbie his jacket to cover himself. Robbie makes Calvin his idol for life.

Twenty years later, Calvin is an accountant whose routine, undramatic life is thrown into chaos by the sudden reappearance of Robbie, now a rogue CIA agent named Bob Stone. The reunion is awkward, particularly when federal agents show up to tell Calvin that his buddy is a fugitive and Calvin faces serious charges if he attempts to protect him. The film then shifts gears into a buddy-action flick with chases, escapes, gunfights, and double crosses. Calvin manages to rattle off non-stop one-liners amid the mayhem even as he wonders whether Robbie is entirely truthful or just playing him.

Audiences already know that Kevin Hart is a funny guy but its Johnson who generates most of the laughs in Central Intelligence. Hart is pretty subdued, compared with his previous screen roles. Johnson in a fat suit in the prologue is a great sight gag, and his comic timing throughout is spot-on. The pairing works remarkably well; the actors have great screen chemistry. Likely this film will be the foundation of a comedy franchise.

The Blu-ray release contains both the theatrical (PG-13) and unrated versions of the film. Bonus extras include a gag reel, alternate takes, and commentary with director Rawson Marshall Thurber. A digital HD copy is included.",1475193600,,1740,5.034722222222222

7777727,4,B01H4FJP7C,"I didn't trick you, you offered to help me. Calvin Joyner (Hart) was the most popular and successful student in high school. Years after graduation he is struggling to live up to expectations and is considering not attending his class reunion. When Bob Stone (Johnson), the most unpopular kid in school shows up Calvin thinks he is being nice by talking to him. When Bobs true intentions, and secrets, come out Calvin is put in a rough spot..and the fate of the world rests on him. I was not really looking forward to seeing this at all. Im not a huge fan of The Rock and I do think Kevin Hart is funny, but can get a little annoying sometimes. I say that to tell you that this movie is hilarious and both of those actors where amazing in this. The Rock really lets his comedic side show and Hart does a great job playing, essentially, the straight man in this movie. Not once did I find him annoying and that added to the enjoyment of this for me. There are some very funny lines and scenes in this and I laughed pretty hard and loud a lot throughout this. Overall, one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while, great chemistry by the actors but the best part was that no one seemed to try to hardwhich made it seem real. I highly recommend this.

7777729,4,B01H4FJP7C,"It doesn't matter who Kevin Hart is paired with it's always going to be a comedy of mismatched partners. Whether it's Ice Cube, Will Ferrell, Josh Gad, or whoever, all of Hart's buddy comedies have a certain familiar feel to them. You've seen one you've seen them all, right? Well, not exactly, not when you team Hart up with the one guy who has reinvigorated more movies and carried more franchises on his shoulders than anybody: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Central Intelligence puts this unlikely pair together and the result is comedy gold that totally flips the typical Hart formula.

Some may not believe this but Johnson is one of the best actors working today. Period.  Is there anything he's proven incapable of? His performance in Central Intelligence calls him to steal the spotlight away from Hart, no small feat, by playing a character that is both physically intimidating and emotionally vulnerable like a bullied schoolkid. Turns out that's exactly who his character, the unfortunately-named Robert Whierdicht aka ""Fat Rob"", proves to be. We're introduced to him as an overweight, afro-headed teen singing En Vogue nude in the shower, only to be jumped by a bunch of bullies and humiliated in front of the entire senior class. The only one to help him out was the coolest kid in school, Calvin ""Golden Jet"" Joyner (Hart), who everyone thought was destined for greatness.

That's not how things turned out, though. Twenty years later and Calvin is working a boring accountant job, and hating every minute of it. It's starting to affect his marriage to high school sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet), who thinks they need some couples therapy. But all Calvin really needs is a friend, just as ""Fat Rob"" needed one years earlier. Enter Bob Stone, who offers an emoji-laden invite to hang out moments after Calvin accepts his Facebook friend request. It turns out that Bob is actually Rob, who has transformed himself into a chiseled Hercules.

As played by Johnson, Bob is one of the most unique and interesting characters in comedy history. He's totally against the masculine He-Man we expect out of Johnson, or at least half of the time he is. Sporting an emasculating fanny pack and My Little Pony t-shirt, Bob is still every bit the dork he was in high school. He's also a devoted worshipper of Calvin's, and can barely hide his glee at being reunited with the school legend. But if you piss Bob off, like a few unfortunate guys do in a bar, well that's when he gets all medieval and resembles his Agent Hobbs character from Fast & Furious.

This Jekyll & Hyde persona thrusts Johnson into the spotlight and Hart into the straight-man role. Calvin is dragged, literally kicking and screaming, through a convoluted plot involving the CIA (led by a tenacious Amy Ryan) and a mysterious terrorist known as ""the Black Badger"". There's some question about the villain's true identity, and even bigger questions about Bob's sanity. Would any rational guy wear that many knitted vests? The plot is pretty much a mess and clearly only there so that Johnson can barrel through a handful of reasonably well-staged action sequences while Hart screams in the background.

Youre like a snack-sized Denzel! Bob enthusiastically fails to cheer up his beleaguered hero.

The oil and water pairing of Johnson and Hart scores nearly every time, though. Story beats that seem lame on the surface; like Bob posing as Calvin's marriage counselor, score big laughs. It's Johnson's utter commitment to such a silly role that does it, along with Hart's constant state of bewilderment. They're joined by a handful of truly surprising cameos better left unspoiled, two of which payoff huge in the final act.  Or better put, final ""acts"" because it does seem that director Rawson Marshall Thurber and co-writer Ike Barinholtz (recently seen in Neighbors 2) struggle to bring the story to a close, which negates some of the emotional impact. Then again it's totally understandable they wouldn't want to bring an end to Bob and Calvin's escapades. The audience won't want it to end, either, but it's okay because all they'll need to do is wait for the inevitable and much-deserved sequel.",1470182400,6,4168,4.927350427350428

I really was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I didn't really love the trailers and was basically dragged to the theaters by my girlfriend to see this. Clocking in at just under 2 hours this is basically a simple comedy that is really over-the-top and doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever.

The movie provides plenty of laughs and a heavy amount of action too for a comedy. If you're on the fence, just give it a shot. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by it.

7777732,2,B01H4FJP7C,"A bizarre buddy movie that is not designed to be bizarre. It's designed to realistic. The movie is a role reversal from one time to the next; when the movie starts, Hart(Calvin) is the top athlete in high school and the Rock(Bob) is fat and an outcast(one of the least popular kids in school--if not the least). Bullies toss fat Bob(then Robert) nude into the middle of a live pep rally--to the jeers of almost everyone there--except 1: leading jock, Calvin. Calvin(as in the story of the good Samaritan) pulls off his letterman jacket and gives Bob the jacket to cover up. After twenty years, Calvin is now boring; while, Bob is now the spicy one(allbeit, with the gov't on his tail for--in a nutshell--reverse espionage and murdering his partner in the CIA). Bob hooks up with Calvin--under his new name, Bob Stone--through Facebook. Bob is an expert fighter with a minor in ""ninjitsu"" escape techniques and his expertise will be put through the test from bad guys and the gov't alike. From these rudiments, the movie will take you through loops where you are trying to figure out who the ultimate bad guys are. Is Bob one of them, someone/a faction within the gov't, or someone else? Once they send you in the direction of the loops, you probably won't be sure until about 2/3-3/4 of the way in. I'm not going to tell you, but I'll say that Calvin gets a job more commensurate with his past(from #1 jock to boring to a spicy job) and the movie all culminates in a special ""day"" with a special ending! Has a couple of funny scenes, too!

This movie has a flicker from the past: the beautiful Danielle Nicolet(Maggie--Calvin's HS sweetheart and later wife); she was Eddie's girlfriend, Vonda, for a few episodes on the hit Family Matters. I also heard that she was in another short lived sitcom.

It gets a 2, because:
The scene where the sprinkler system was supposed to go off was uberfake! Sprinkler systems go off if smoke is created, so that the building will not burn down! There were at least 30 minutes of action(maybe longer) from the time that Bob lights Calvin's suit tie until the sprinklers actually go off and the burning tie was hanging directly underneath a sprinkler! So, to believe that scene, you must believe that a sprinkler system wouldn't activate after a minute or two worth of smoke has tripped its sensors; also, I ask you; would he have 30 minutes before the sprinkler system activated?! An important scene happens there, where Bob escapes the gov't with the help of the ""paused"" activated sprinkler system that benefits only Bob. The motorbike fight scene is also uberfake!  The motorbike became a ""ninja's fist, weapon, or leg"" right before our eyes! You'd have to assume 3 things to believe that scene: 1. the bike was as light as a weapon or that it could defy gravity based solely on the man manuevering the bike; 2. this was a daredevil that could do something that evil knievel could never get close to attempting; this man was able to make a MOTORbike perform precise flips over and over again quickly within a short space and with little recoiling or regaining speed; and 3. Bob was proven as an expert fighter at this point and, yet, he could not avoid an airborne bike coming straight at him! Bob disappears at a moment's notice, too, into thin air(without a trace) when he's about to be caught a couple of times! You'll probably find other of these IMPORTANT GOOFS, ERRORS, ETC.!

Also, the illuminati rears it's ugly head, too: upside down crosses(and straight ones joined together), Bob pecks Calvin(Hart)(gayish scene hidden in role reversal psychology from the world of marriage counselling), Bob's old bully vulgarly pretends to be a Christian, etc.",1467504000,3,3694,4.7224806201550384
