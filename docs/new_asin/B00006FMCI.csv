7968479,5,B00006FMCI,"Just responding to the daft 'review' complaining that Palmer's film is not sufficiently 'like the original'!  This may have been tongue-in-cheek, if so I apologise for missing the joke.  The 'original' is of course Mann's novella, not the Visconti film, which despite its visual beauty (not hard to achieve given Venice!) is a sanitised and limply romanticised version of Mann's complex work.
Britten's work is not originally a film - it is a stage work, and has been (in my opinion) brilliantly re-imagined by Tony Palmer in his film version.  Britten in turn has re-created Mann's work for the musical stage, and in the process written one of the most haunting and darkly unforgettable operas of the 20th century.",1398643200,,715,4.991596638655462
7968480,4,B00006FMCI,"This excellent DVD of Britten's restrained and beautiful opera is notable for Tony Palmers imaginative direction and the outstanding performance by Australian tenor, Robert Gard, in the lead.
The latest re-issure of the DVD credits Vincent Redman as Tadzio, not Julian Rhind-Tutt. Of Mr Redman, I can find no other information anywhere.",1355270400,,336,5.480769230769231
7968481,1,B00006FMCI,"For those people, like me, who thoroughly enjoyed the original ""Death in Venice"" with Dirk Bogarde and directed by Luchino Visconti and was expecting a newer, updated version of the timeless classic - you will be diappointed. Benjamin Britten's ""D-I-V"" is completely different. The operatic adaptation lends nothing to the beauty and tragedy of the original film. Missing is the seductive yet silent relationship between the two main characters - the elderly Gustav, played by Bogarde and the young Tadzio. Britten's ""opera"" loses this important interaction in it's muddled cinematography. I failed to see - or what was lost to me in the film's overly choreographed and sometimes over-the-top operatic style - the main premise of the movie. The story of an old, washed up artist who becomes obsessed with the beauty of a youth and the chance for renewal set against the backdrop of an ugly and devastating plague. Britten's musical, lyrical ""Death"" is too wrapped up in style rather thaqn substance. Too mmuch for my taste. Visconti's ""Death"" was compelling and powerfull. mesmerizing and haunting, and lyrical in it's own right.
The newer Britten version is a mish-mosh adn those - like me - expecting it to be anything like the original will be sadly disappointed.",1220745600,3,1266,5.091346153846154
7968482,5,B00006FMCI,"Excellent production, and wonderful dvd.

To answer a question raised in other reviews, Tadzio is played by British actor Julian Rhind-Tutt, more recently seen in the British hit comedy, ""Green Wing"".",1219449600,7,200,5.451612903225806
7968483,4,B00006FMCI,"I was pleasantly surprised by this filmic adaptation of Britten's last opera, since I know of many unsuccessful attempts in the direction of filmed operas (e.g., the recent Turn of the Screw). This was obviously a tight-budget production, with a minimum of nature shots in Venice and a lot of studio work, so the final result is a great tribute to the skills and devotion of Tony Palmer.  The way he matched the Venice vistas to the music are particularly impressive. Another excellent bit of directing is the hero's nightmare, which is very difficult to convey in stage productions.

The only major problem of this production is the main character, Aschenbach. As far as I understand, it was hoped that Peter Pears (for whom the role was written) will appear in this film. In Tony Palmer's documentary about Britten (""A time there was..."") we can see what appears to be a fragment of this film, with Pears as Aschenbach and another (younger) boy as Tadzio. Unfortunately, Pears suffered a stroke in 1980, so Robert Gard had to step into this role. It is hard to tell what is wrong with him, since he sings well and looks fine for his character. But some sort of charisma is absent, and the show in fact belongs to the multiple baritone characters of John Shirley-Quirk (his Leader of the Players is simply stunning). Obviously, Shirley-Quirk is a great singer and actor, and we have to be grateful for seeing him in this film, but the opera was intended to be virtually Aschenbach's monologue, and the current production does not convey this intention. Another (minor) problem is an inexplicable cut in the scene with the Elderly Fop.

I find it very strange that the DVD does not give any credits for the role of Tadzio (and other mimed roles), as well as for the minor singing roles. I could not find any information about this film in the Internet, not even in Tony Palmer's own web page. Was there some copyright clash with the Visconti's film? Anyway, it is a great pity that this fine film remains virtually unknown to a wider audience.",1217462400,17,2043,4.685236768802229
7968484,5,B00006FMCI,"A gutsy, beautiful looking film, a score which if not Britten's greatest opera is easily one of the most beautiful, a tested and sympathetic conductor, and the great John Shirley-Quirk reprising the Traveller opposite Robert Gard - what's not to love! Palmer makes customary magic with every determining motive behind the camera. Nothing stops his vision. The colors of the film evoke Visconti's, as they might; Aschenbach's Venice isn't changed. What music! Here's an opera that ought to be taken up and done regularly. Britten is misheard in his operas in America, to some extent. We needn't a revival so much as first and true consent. This is one of the last century's greatest operas, which if not neglected remains misapprehended, perhaps, despite Visconti's evocative film. The orchestral forces positively slither out of the orchestra pit. Recording balances are fine, with shimmer and intimacy. Steuart Bedford's ardent gifts thrive in nuance after nuance. He's a master at opening an orchestra's sound from the inside out, and Britten's bounty of gorgeously seductive music provides a glistening canvas to fan. I agree the Tadzio actor is not compelling, but Gard sings Aschenbach masterfully, with real lights about who the character is for Mann. Robert Tear's Aschenbach is winningly sung, but this production packs everything that only Palmer brings to a film effort. He's a filmmaker who deeply understands music. It makes all the difference. Huge recommendation for a grave and wondrous score, and a film worthy of Britten's last, great opera.",1197244800,28,1558,5.261044176706827
