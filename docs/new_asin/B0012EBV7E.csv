8245547,3,B0012EBV7E,"Okay, this one isn't nearly as good as the first. I hate to say it but it was down-right boring. I'll buy the next one (last one) but it may take a long time to watch as I can't watch more than two or three episodes before I start going crazy. I hope the next season is better.

Video quality is fairly degraded and the aspect ratio is in 1.33.1 (4:3) which is normal for the early 1990's.",1468972800,,389,3.9871794871794872

8245549,5,B0012EBV7E,I really love this series of Jupiter moon and I will order all the episodes in this series because it is really good. It is amazing how this is so good.,1367971200,,152,3.935483870967742
8245550,5,B0012EBV7E,"This is a fun, though dated series. It is basically a soap dressed in SF clothing. Little to do with SF issues, which are used only as a stimulus (or backdrop) for the human interaction. The characters are, however, easy to get involved with. The acting is a bit stilted, which in many cases, saves the low budget project from being un-watchable.

I enjoyed it. One should start at the start and watch it in order, as with many soaps, one must keep up with the interplay of characters.",1307404800,,485,4.449438202247191
8245551,4,B0012EBV7E,"Anyone who has read previous reviews from me will know that I simply MUST get my hands on anything ""Sci'fi"".  Thus, I had to buy all four of the ""Jupiter Moon"" sets.  Yes, they were filmed decades ago, and yes the technology is sad, and no there are no big special effects (darn it), and yes, it is kind of like a soap opera and a little predictable.  And, yes the acting is sometimes like watching a school play (and others quite surprisingly good).  But, all in all, I have to say I was completedly hooked after watching the first show!  I got my sets at different times and could hardly wait for each one to arrive.  You've gotten the premice from other reviews, so I won't waste time here.  But, I must tell you that I am completely in love with this series.  I hated to see it end (and hated the ending as well...I wanted it to go on and on so I could see what happened to my beloved characters).  Well worth the money I paid for these sets!!!",1275436800,,948,4.164835164835165
8245552,1,B0012EBV7E,"I ordered the 4 volumes of this series from 4 different vendors on the Amazon Marketplace. Every single one of them came sealed, but with broken cases and loose discs. I wrote to the customer service email at Image Entertainment - and the email bounced! I then called them, and they told me ""Tough Luck - go back to the merchants.""That might be reasonable if it had not been ALL FOUR SETS! I have done that anyway. I have gotten partial reimbursements from a couple of them. But that's not fair to them, or me. Look at the number of items that say ""sealed, but discs are loose"". Image Entertainment needs to be taken to task for these shoddy products, and their attitude. I own hundreds of discs from Image and even explained that to them. These are the only ones I have had a problem with. But you can bet from now on I will think twice before ever buying another one of their products!",1245801600,2,887,4.349397590361446
8245553,5,B0012EBV7E,"This series produced more pleasant memories than all but one speculative fiction video  show has in the last decade. It seems that all the others have some ""super secret"" component: either the heroes have super powers, or super technology, or  some super foe to face down - or two or even all three - and they have to keep the public from knowing about them. While this may make the stories more interesting, it makes the characters hard to identify with.

The characters on Jupiter Moon, on the other hand, are for the most part the kind of people you can find hanging out on any college campus: students, both under and post graduate, professors, research staff, and the people involved in running the university. It's just that said university happens to be in a future, and in space, and on a ship. None of these things are unusual in this future. Given the broad range of characters in the show, there should be someone for anyone to identify with - and possibly several someones.

This is much more like the sf I grew up reading than most other things, which are more akin to comic books than real sf. The people seem like real people, and you have to suspend your disbelieve about their environment, not about them. Yes, some of the ""science"" is a bit hokey, but at least it doesn't often sound like it came from a word processor set on blend. This wouldn't rate five stars if it were a book - the story just isn't that good. But when you compare it against other members of the the medium it's in, it more than deserves them. If only there were more of this, or more like it.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, that one exception is FireFly.",1222214400,,1649,4.429042904290429
8245554,5,B0012EBV7E,"In 1990, British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB) launched a soap opera for their Galaxy Channel, set 60 years in the future aboard an old spaceship called the Ilea orbiting the Jupiter moon Callisto -- and housing Columbus College, a university of space.  Episodes were shown three days a week, with a full compilation of those episodes broadcast on the following Sunday. 150 episodes were made in total, with 108 shown before the infamous 'merger' of BSB with Sky.

The idea behind the production was to feature a mixture of emotional angst and the thrill of scientific adventure. The episodes in The Ghost in the Machine contain the most effective merger of both. Ghostly apparitions are haunting the Ilea's students, while an unusual `blip' appears whenever a file concerning an earlier spaceship journey is displayed on a computer. That earlier journey featured the first murder in the Jupiter system. A computer has been programmed for death -- and the program is running...

Just when the mystery is solved and everyone can finally breathe a sigh of relief, comes one of the most shocking events ever to appear on a television screen. Definitely the highlight of the entire series and highly recommended.",1209513600,2,1207,5.055276381909548
