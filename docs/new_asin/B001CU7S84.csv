8289364,2,B001CU7S84,The senseless murders that took place at Waco were covered-up by the FBI and mismanaged by the then Attorney General Janet Reno and President Bill Clinton. The impact of the events at Waco are still being felt since many of the players in the Federal Government at that time are part of the Obama Administration. Waco was a betrayal of the American People by our government and the consequences were a factor in recruitment of Militia members and one of the reasons Timothy McVey blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City. The video failed to show key footage of the shoot out with ATF agents and failed to weigh the consequences of the FBI misconduct. The film was a disappointment.,1357862400,5,687,4.68595041322314
