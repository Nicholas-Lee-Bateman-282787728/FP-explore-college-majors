8637051,2,B00HX54BT6,"Buyer Beware:

This is a really cool ""old school"" kids show that is not over the top theatrics and keeping things simple for kids to be entertained.  The only problem is the DVD itself.  The show I do believe was produced in Canada and it appears these DVD's are formatted that way.  The DVD works enough to watch a few episodes but then it just stops.  If your DVD player doesn't have multi formatting functions then watching this DVD probably won't happen.  Check your DVD player first before buying.",1503014400,,502,4.584269662921348
