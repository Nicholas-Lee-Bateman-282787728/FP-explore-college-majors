8110546,4,B000EIW1VO,"Made for British cable television in the early 90's, this was one in a series of four movies inspired by the romantic Barbara Cartland period novels. A GHOST IN MONTE CARLO is the story of young Mistral (Lysette Anthony) on the edge of adulthood, who goes to live with her scheming and manipulative Aunt Emilie (Sarah Miles) and begins a whirlwind adventure filled with romance, intrigue and suspense. Hoping to escape her past as Parisian madame and desperately trying to avenge the death of her sister, Aunt Emilie devises a plan that hinges upon a pairing between Mistral and the handsome Prince Nicholas. But the wrong people are vying for Mistral's affections...and carefully-laid plans are going awry...

This adaptation of Dame Barbara Cartland's novel ""Ghost in Monte Carlo"" also incorporates themes and characters from some of her other novels, in particular ""Fragrant Flower"". The amazing cast assembled for this film also includes Oliver Reed, Christopher Plummer, Samantha Eggar, Ron Moody, Fiona Fullerton and Joanna Lumley.",1149552000,,1037,5.284848484848485
