8377559,2,B002Q7YNDA,"I own this DVD. It's a highly produced DVD and Hayes makes it very watchable; HOWEVER. This is not a DVD on Togakure Ryu Ninpo and is NOT really a Kihon DVD either. What is shown here is a bunch of the basic skills taught in the Bujinkan curriculum from various schools within the Bujinkan. If you want a DVD that shows genuine Togakure Ryu kata and techniques then you should get any and all of the Jinenkan DVD's entitled Togakure Ryu because they contain every piece of kata within the Togakure Ryu school as well as the Togakure Ryu DVDs that Soke Hatsumi has released. This ""Togakure Ryu Ninja Taijutsu Kihon"" is NOT a Togakure Ryu DVD though it contains elements of the school. An to say it's Kihon is very wrong because the very first and most important part of the Kihon of ANY of the schools is ukemi, taihenjutsu, taisabaki, NONE of this is show in this DVD aside from a couple of basic rolls. You should first be learning all breakfalls, rolls, and variations of these rolls, front handsprings, cartwheels etc rolling with a weapon and so on. What is shown here are the techniques learned in the KYU grading system of Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. The Togakure Ryu title is VERY misleading. Other than taht it's a GREAT DVD for what it REALLY is. BUT IT IS NOT A DVD ON TOGAKURE RYU. For the misleading marketing ploy I give it two stars. For quality and production I give it 5 stars.",1298419200,13,1389,4.4296875
