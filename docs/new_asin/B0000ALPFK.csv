1908133,5,B0000ALPFK,"What can really be said about ""Watchers"" and ""Watchers 2.""  Based loosely (and boy do I mean loosely) on the novel by Dean R. Koontz, these movies are the story of a dog and his brother... a genetically enginerread military monster.  These are the kinds of movies, that as kids scare the hell out of us, that we forget when we grow older.  Then one day when were in the video store, or fliping around bad cable, we see it once again, and we realize hows not scary, but still good they are.
I grew up in a house that loved cheesy B horror moives, so Watchers was just one on a long list.  I had completely forgot about it until one day I was going throuh my bookcase and found the paperback novel.  Not remember much about the movie (other than Corey Haim was in it), I came here to amazon, and purchased my copy.  When I recieved it, I poped it in a watched both films.
The first movie, although cheaply done, was in face pretty good.  The acting wasn't great, but it was much better than expected, and the speical effects were half bad.  The Second movie I hate to say, had a much better script, but worse acting and budgets.
If your a fan of 80s B Horror, movies this is definatly worth a look, or at least a rental.",1073779200,2,1218,4.1752136752136755
1908134,3,B0000ALPFK,"Watchers isn't a classic but has many fun moments. I'm not quite sure how it managed to be rated R because it is fairly tame. The movie is about a mutant who goes psychotic placing a dog and his new family in danger. It is based on a book by Dean Koontz. Corey Haim and Michael Ironside play their parts well. Jason Priestley even makes an appearance. The dog is fantastic in the film (assuming you are an animal lover). I prefer The Lost Boys but this movie is entertaining enough with plenty of kills and a light-hearted tone.

Watchers II is almost a remake of Watchers. It is closer to the novel but it isn't quite as good as the original film. This two-pack DVD has managed to hold its value well.",1385856000,,702,4.2781954887218046

1908136,5,B0000ALPFK,"This movie is a good family horror as to educate kids about monsters, It's not overdone by any means and still shows a lot of interest in there, to keep you entertained. The story is fabulous and the actors did a good job convincing you it was real. There is no blood splatters or thrills in this show to keep us horror freaks amused but I don't mind sharing this with a bit younger age groups. So get comfortable pull up a chair put your feet up to relax for a pleasant night of mild horror for a change don't forget to grab the munchies and enjoy.",1376870400,,549,4.140186915887851

1908142,3,B0000ALPFK,"Watchers
---------------------
The military has devised a pair of biological weapons to use in tactical assaults against the enemy: one, a super-intelligent canine unit used to locate and infiltrate the enemy, and the other, a mutant beast sent to seek and destroy the dog any anyone in its proximity. When one of the dogs escapes and aligns itself with a high school student, it is up to a trained assassin to find the two and stop the killer Oxcom unit! WATCHERS is a fun, kid-friendly creature-feature from the late-80's starring Corey Haim as the film's eccentric teenager that is constantly on the run. It manages to strike an even balance between the campy humor involving the clever canine and the scarier moments when the Oxcom attacks from just off-camera in a series of bloodless kills. Most of the film's suspense is built on the final reveal of the creature when it catches up with Travis and Furface in the end, but the short lived battle is anti-climactic. Michael Ironside makes an appearance as the ruthless N.S.O. agent, living up to the typically sadistic villains he has portrayed in other films. Along with its sequels, WATCHERS makes for an entertaining monster movie with plenty of safe thrills!

Watchers 2
----------------------
WATCHERS 2 is an unrelated sequel featuring another Oxcom unit and its clever canine companion that are released from an experimental laboratory by a group of animal rights activists. The dog links up with marine facing a court-martial, and the two attempt to outrun the military officials and the killer beast that will stop at nothing to destroy its target. Now under the guidance of Roger Corman's Concorde Pictures, the series immediately moves away from the lighter tone of the original in exchange for a more adult theme, bloodier murders, and a darker mood. B-movie queen Tracy Scoggins joins THE BEASTMASTER's Marc Singer as the film's ineffectual leads, who are each out-acted by their lovable four-legged co-star. The Oxcom (now called an ""Outsider"") no longer hides in the shadows, but openly attacks its victims in plain sight, which unfortunately reveals the creature's cheap rubbery design. Even with its inherent cheesiness, WATCHERS 2 packs in just enough creepy monster mayhem and gore to make it an entertaining (if not trashy) sequel.

1908143,5,B0000ALPFK,Terrific purchase.  When Corey passed I was so upset.  I grew up with his movies and wanted to have movies of his to remember him by.  So many sites were trying to cash in on his death and charging ridiculous prices for his movies.  This same dvd was on another website selling for $180.  Insane.  This dvd came in practically brand new condition.  It was nice to watch again after all these years.  Thank you for the memories.,1274400000,3,427,4.384615384615385
1908144,5,B0000ALPFK,"I, too, am a huge fan of Dean Koontz. I saw ""Watchers"" before I read the book. I enjoyed the low-budget effort, however painful it is to watch Corey Haim. Certainly things must be modified to translate a book to film. I'm a sucker for a good dog portrayal, and I wasn't dsappointed. Other Koontz books, ""Phantoms"" and ""Hideaway"", were pretty good, and the TV mini-series of ""Intensity"" was very good. Bottom line: I enjoyed ""Watchers"" a lot and would buy the DVD in a minute if it was at a decent price. I taped the film off AMC years ago (before commercials), so I can still enjoy it. I can appreciate low budget efforts and crappy special effects if there's some substance. Not great, but the entertainment level met my needs.",1236556800,,728,4.5227272727272725
1908145,2,B0000ALPFK,"I never saw the 2nd film but I saw the first and that's what this review is on. If you watch...Watchers and think it's a crappy movie, I strongly recommend the book. The book is engaging and smart and the movie is barely like it. In the book, you have a former soldier named Travis who's used to people dieing that he gets close to and he's a lonely man. He finds a special dog and meets a self-concious woman named Nora. He loves them both dearly and fears losing them. There's a monster after them, that was a lab experiment like the dog and like the dog, he also escaped. While a crazy hitman is after the dog as well who believes he absorbs the energy of the people he kills.

  In the movie, you just get...Corey Haim as a Travis, a teenage boy who's dad was in the Delta Force like Travis was supposed to be part of in the book. He finds a smart dog who was part of a lab experiment and a dangerous creature that hates the dog is after them. The dog is about as likable and cute as he was in the book but other than that it's a terrible adaption of a very good Dean Koontz book. I mean you have Corey Haim with his big 80's hair cut with a shot gun shooting at a monster. He has nothing on the Travis in the book. Hell, the movie only does the dog justice and that's it. I really hope they remake this with a good cast and  director. This makes Dreamcatcher look like a great adaption to a book.",1221264000,,1401,4.028776978417266
1908146,2,B0000ALPFK,"Short and sweet ... Why does Hollywood think that a movie can have the title of a good book, yet not follow the story line?  About the only simularity to Mr. Koontz' book is a ""smart"" Golden Retriever.  We do not see the gradual awareness the ""hero"" has of the dog's intelligence, based upon the question/answer process and the Scrabble letter machine.  Where does a Teen come in, in the book?  It doesn't!  I was really disappointed ... as I usually am with Hollywood's pictures from a book I have read.",1190505600,2,504,4.4945054945054945
1908147,5,B0000ALPFK,"Anyone giving this anything lower than 3 stars is just plain stupid. The movie was very good. Don't listen to the mourons. Try this movie, you won't regret it.",1171065600,,159,4.517241379310345
1908148,1,B0000ALPFK,"Awful, just awful.  I think it would have been just as awful if I hadn't read the book before I saw the movie and realized that it was butchered.  Suspense in the book becomes boredom in the movie.  Terror in the book becomes schlock in the movie.  The Outsider looked like something created by a 1950s B-movie producer.  All the best parts of human interaction are stripped out.  Look, I know that a movie can't contain everything in the book, but still.  Books can be significantly shortened and/or altered and yet still be great movies, like ""Presumed Innocent"" and ""Patriot Games"" (OK, so I'm a Harrison Ford fan -- so sue me).  I guess the only thing that consoles me is that Mr. Koontz didn't write the screenplay, so I can still respect him.

And one other thing.  I'm tired of being preached to by Hollywood liberals.  One cannot purchase an MP5 or any other firearm on sight in California.  The state has a 10-day waiting period for all firearms purchases and has had one for decades.  See Cal. Penal Code 12071(b)(1)(3)(A) and 12072(c)(1).",1140220800,3,1049,4.635869565217392
1908149,1,B0000ALPFK,"I am a devout Dean Koontz fan, I bow to his decandence filled elegance. The first book I read from him was ""The Bad Place"" and I haven't looked back. This movie is a slap in the face to the man who has given so many incredible stories.

I am a fan of cheesey, B-horror moves (see original ""Dawn of the Dead"", but a teenaged Corey Haim as a 40 something ex-special ops man, get real. Trust me DO NOT READ BOOK FIRST!!! If you haven't read book, you'll probably enjoy this cheesefest. I would give this movie no stars, but Amazon won't let me.

Mr. Koontz, since you have more control over how you're books are translated now, I hope there is a time when you can pay correct homage to Furball.",1130371200,18,691,4.18796992481203
1908150,4,B0000ALPFK,"""Watchers"" opens with an experiment gone horribly awry. The United States military, always up to no good according to Hollywood, came up with a really groovy way to rack up a high body count during a war. Panadyne, one of those secret Department of Defense research laboratories, developed two organic weapons systems. The first ingredient of the project is a dog, a very intelligent dog trained to roam enemy landscapes looking for soldiers and, one presumes, innocent civilians. Whoever finds the dog and befriends the creature is in for the shock of their life, though. You see, Panadyne also created a hideously twisted organism capable of wreaking bloody havoc in a big way. A telepathic link between the dog and this creature--called Oxcom--allows the creature and the dog to communicate. Moreover, Oxcom hates the dog with all of its being, and will do anything to track down the canine and destroy it. This hatred is in fact the primary motivation for the creature to act as a weapon of mass destruction. The opening sequences show us the inevitable; the dog and the creature escape from the laboratory and head out into the good old U.S. of A. looking for trouble.

Teenager Travis Cornell (Corey Haim) discovers the dog after fleeing from a covert meeting with his girlfriend. Immediately impressed with the canine's intelligence, Cornell takes the animal home even though his mother won't allow her son to keep pets in the house. As Travis blithely drives away, his girlfriend's father stumbles over Oxcom and perishes in a particularly horrible manner. The girlfriend escapes largely unharmed and summons the police to the farmhouse. An operative from the National Defense apparatus, Lem Johnson (Michael Ironside) and his partner, arrives on the scene looking to close up the potential security risks arising from the escape and subsequent killing. You can more or less imagine what follows for the rest of the film: Travis, his mother, and the dog soon flee from the ravaging Oxcom with Lem Johnson hot on their trail. Lots of gory murders take place as the creature kills everything in its march to the dog. The conclusion involves the obligatory violent showdown between Travis and the creature, with Lem Johnson revealing the requisite plot twist one always sees in these types of films. Oh, I almost forgot--Jason Priestley turns up to say hello as one of Travis's friends before falling under the bloody claws of Oxcom.

""Watchers II"" is, surprisingly, not a total retread of the first film despite what others have said. On this outing, the weapons program involving the dog and the creature is still going strong, and once again a violent escape takes place. An army deserter named Paul Ferguson (Marc Singer) befriends the pooch after the creature kills the two MPs assigned to bring him in. Once again, the dog shows off its intelligence by managing to bring Paul into contact with animal psychologist Barbara White (Tracey Scoggins). With the help of the dog, Paul and Barbara figure out what's going on and make plans to destroy the vicious creature. Meanwhile, one of the doctors from the laboratory tracks down the creature and decides to take care of it out of a sense of misplaced love for his horrific creation. The conclusion to the film runs on and on for what feels like an eternity as Paul goes down into the sewer system in pursuit of the Oxcom creature.

I'm a bit surprised at the scorn heaped on these two movies. Both films are solid B budget efforts that do manage to entertain for a couple of hours. I've never read the Dean Koontz novel that gave birth to the ""Watchers"" franchise (there are two more sequels after the second entry), so perhaps that is why I can appreciate these films when others do not. Of the two films, I have to go with the first one as the better effort. It's fun to see Jason Priestley turned into ground beef by a slimy monster, and the gore effects are generous and look effective. Also, I'm a big Michael Ironside fan, so any film with him sneering and threatening is sure to grab my attention. The pitfalls of ""Watchers"" include Corey Haim at his smarmiest, and the increasingly goofy antics of the dog. I'll buy some of the tricks the pooch pulls off, but I was groaning with derision by the time the dog is typing out a message on a computer. But, and this is a big but, the dog is quite endearing and the movie makes you root for him almost from the get go.

""Watchers II"" is classic B movie nirvana, a movie so pedestrian that you'll forget all about it five minutes after the credits roll. Yet the film does have a high point. Marc Singer possesses an amazing ability to act alongside animals. We saw him do it in ""Beastmaster"" and we see him do it here just as well. I always hear how actors can't stand to star opposite an animal because the critters take all the attention away from the human, but Singer doesn't seem to mind (insert your own joke here, please). He talks to the dog and responds to the animal's actions in such a way that you actually believe this pooch is a genius. Regrettably, Singer's skills with the beastie cannot rescue the film from lousy and sporadic gore effects, an incredibly ridiculous looking monster, and various creature feature clichs that hang over this picture like a cloud of doom. I recommend giving these two movies a shot if you're looking for something mindless to pass a few hours. As you should know by now, you could always do much, much worse.",1094515200,22,5466,4.714435146443515

7997580,3,B0000ALPFK,"This review is for Watchers (the first one).

Really the only reason I'm being somewhat polite and giving Watchers 3 stars is because it's entertaining in strictly a campy kind of way... and of course the golden retriever is *really* adorable.  You got me there!  Unintentionally to an extent perhaps, this movie reveals just how intelligent these particular type of dogs are (though I already knew from personal experience having owned a golden retriever/lab mix for 12 years).

Anyway, Watchers is an alright film.  It's about a big hairy Bigfoot-resembling creature that sets out on a mission to viciously track down an extremely smart golden retriever and the family the dog ends up living with (specifically a teenage boy and his mother) who do everything they can to keep the dog safe.  It's odd however that the mother would spend so much of her time disliking the idea of having a dog only to end up defending the animal during life and death situations but that's beside the point.

To continue the story- the two men who work at this secret government lab (one of them played by the really believable Michael Ironside) desperately want to retrieve (har har) the dog, even though these two men are clearly up to no good.  So basically throughout the movie the hairy Bigfoot creature runs around a small town (most notable in the school) and kills people in ways that are so laughably bad that it's amazing Watchers was even able to get approval for release.

The worst killing is when a janitor I believe, was stabbed through the chest and hanging on the wall in the school basement just in time for the cops to come down and see it.  There's no suspense during this scene for one thing, but the killing *itself* is just really bad.  Most of the killings aren't actually shown throughout Watchers- you see fast jerky movements and then afterwards you see the dead body.  They do ever so slightly improve later on however, but it's nothing worth your time.

Basically if it wasn't for the adorable and smart golden retriever dog, this would have easily been a 1-star forgettable film unless you have a special admiration for cheap 80's horrors.  Otherwise... well on an unrelated note, I thought the mother was hot and during one particular scene where she kisses her son goodnight in a hotel room, for a brief moment the thought occurred to me that she was actually young enough to be the girlfriend of the son if the writers wanted to use her for that role and well... my mind went somewhere else for a moment, lol.

Oh and the ending really stinks.  I mean REALLY stinks.  It's too abrupt.  Also the girlfriend of the boy could have played a bigger role despite being kidnapped (and I thought she *would* have played a bigger role but it wasn't meant to be).  Overall... this is a pretty lousy film but hey, a high tolerance for cheesy 80's horror flicks might enable one to appreciate something like this more than I ever could.",1405468800,,2940,4.6518375241779495
