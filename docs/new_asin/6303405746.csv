7847623,5,6303405746,This is a great movie and a very hard one to find. It didn't seek to completely demonize Gordon Kahl as one might expect.,1389139200,2,121,4.083333333333333
7847624,2,6303405746,"Gordon Kahl was a decorated veteran of WWII fighting the Nazis.  He was essentially one of those poor souls who our government, from time to time, executes in order to strike terror in the minds of those who might be tempted to wander outside the box of political correctness. He was finally burned alive by the FBI in Mena, Arkansas. I think the people who owned the farm where he was hiding out were sent to prison forever. Is it necessary to slaughter eccentrics like Kahl in order to keep the rest of us in line?  Kahl and his family basically just wanted to be left alone. But, as we saw later at Ruby Ridge and Waco, that is simply not allowed. ""Death and Taxes"" is a much better telling of the same events. Also, the Canadian author Ian Slater does a good job in many of his novels in looking at things from the standpoint of the put upon survivalist. Rod Steiger was such a genius at playing crazed villains. It is not clear that Gordon Kahl, the Weaver Family, or the Branch Davidian were worthy of FBI extinction, but that is what they got. Poor souls all. The Bill of Rights seems to be eroding all the time. Not a pretty sight.",1232064000,7,1139,4.317757009345795
7847625,3,6303405746,"This movie is good entertainment for the rest of the country, but as a North Dakota native, the movie is a farce as far as the facts of the case are concerned. The movie also portrays rural North Dakotans as small-minded, racist morons which I didn't appreciate at all (for instance, the man in the trailer using the words ""what in tarnation!).

However, a good movie as far as movies go with a first rate cast.",1231286400,3,411,4.407894736842105
7847626,5,6303405746,this is a excellent movie I just wished they would put it on dvd,1131494400,,64,3.642857142857143
7847627,4,6303405746,"First rate dramatisation of the true story of anti-government activist Gordon Kahl and the deadly 1983 shoot out between Kahl (with fellow members of the Posse Comitatus ) & several law enforcement officers that resulted in the violent deaths of two lawmen. The bloody gunfight in Medina, North Dakota resulted in Kahl fleeing his injured son, and being pursued across the Dakota's for several months by FBI agents. The script is based around the well written book ""Bitter Harvest"", penned by author James Corcoran detailing the history of Kahl's fifteen year long feud with the US government for refusal to pay income taxes, his incarceration, and the tragic ""Twilight Murders"" at Medina in February, 1983.

Nuggetty Rod Steiger puts in a terrific performance portraying the hateful and rascist Kahl, and Michael Gross is equally impressive as the dogged FBI agent Mayberly trying to track down the violent Kahl before others are put in harms way. The effectively produced, ""In The Line Of Duty"" telemovies covering various real life crimes do tend to swing between outstanding and mediocre in their overall quality, however this one is easily one of the best of the series. Also check out ""In The Line Of Duty : The FBI Murders"" and ""In The Line Of Duty : Seige at Marion"".....both highly recommended.",1096416000,6,1303,5.0046082949308754
7847628,4,6303405746,THis is a wonderful film with Rod Stieger playing an anti-goverment militia member on the run.  Based on a true story this is a wonderful little move that will be enjoyed by all.,1071187200,4,178,4.393939393939394
