8046872,5,B0007D4M5Y,Another Winner...easily equal to Graham Greenes SHADES OF GREENE.  Deliciously Evocative....Brilliant,1415664000,3,101,8.181818181818182
8046873,5,B0007D4M5Y,"Great viewing for times when there is nothing else to watch on the Telly - (as the Brits would say)

I just wish we had good programs like this running today. ""The tales of the unexpected"" will allure and entertain you like a siren's song.

What more can I say  (I can't believe T of the U Set # 4 does NOT have closed captioning but sets 1,2, and 3 do.

what gives????",1370736000,,369,4.013698630136986
8046874,3,B0007D4M5Y,"Accomplishing the ""twenty spine chilling tales"", an Australian-produced five-DVD set presents, according to producers, a cream de la cream of the Dahl's stories-tragic, deceptive, ambiguous events depicted by a strongly hilarious way.

It is good for watching in-between something more educative and mind-broadening.",1251158400,,316,6.348837209302325
8046875,5,B0007D4M5Y,"these are really great sets...they are almost perfectly balanced with suspense,mystery,quirkiness,and a slight touch of supernatural overtones when they are needed.the stories are entertaining in every aspect.i love british entertainment anyway(especially the comedies),so i'm not surprised that they produce shows that excel in america because they have a different view of certain genres.you can watch a lot of these made-for-tv programs with almost any age group because profanity is almost non-existent(some of the subject matter may be inappropriate for youngsters).all in all,this is a great series and well worth a look!",1194393600,8,627,5.9010989010989015
8046876,5,B0007D4M5Y,"This is the best of all the ""Tales of the Unexpected"" Series. I thought the show with Julie Harris playing in ""Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat"" was the best, until I saw Eli Wallach in ""Shatterproof"" and then I preferred this show above all else. Someone else may take issue with this choice but I preferred it.  Highly Recommended.",1168300800,8,334,4.566666666666666
8046877,4,B0007D4M5Y,"not the slimline black case the 1,3 & 4 set I bought at the same time! I liked the TV series & the books, 1 star from another reviewer is mean! Classic British TV here.",1149120000,5,168,3.8285714285714287
8046878,1,B0007D4M5Y,"After the disappointment of the last edition of this series, I bought this expecting some more predictable and familiar tales this time around. Needless to say I won't be buying the third edition.",1148688000,3,196,4.96969696969697
