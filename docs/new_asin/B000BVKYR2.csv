8093024,5,B000BVKYR2,"I was very impressed with this production. First, I was amazed that such an impressive group of former players were assembled to participate. In addition to Theismann, Hornung, and Montana, there is also John Huarte, Terry Hanratty, Tony Rice, Rick Mirer and more. All give insight into what the experience was like to be the point man on Notre Dame's offense. From recruiting to being assigned a jersey number to playing in some of the biggest games in college football, every story provides a fascinating look into the most storied college football program in the country. Narrated by Tony Roberts, an inspired choice as he has been the radio voice of Notre Dame for decades. Go Irish!!!",1136851200,8,689,4.897435897435898
