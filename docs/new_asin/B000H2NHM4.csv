8602249,5,B000H2NHM4,"Dr. Christopher Roy's ""Masks of Leaves and Wood: The Bwa People of the Village of Boni, Burkina Faso"" offers beautiful footage of both mask performances and of villagers' participation in these ceremonies.  Roy's voice-over narration provides information about the making and meaning of the masks, about village life and social structures, and about masking rituals and religious beliefs.  As a principal scholar in the art of Burkina Faso, the information is both fascinating and credible.  Also included are the voices of the participating Africans, providing an Afrocentric point of view. Though the camera is somewhat shaky for the first third of the film, Roy is transparent about production of it, thus accounting for the lack of tripod.  The movie is conveniently divided into three sections, making the showing of all, or portions of the film conducive to an academic setting.  Scenes of both the family owned plank masks and the ephemeral leaf masks are intriguingly beautiful.",1211241600,3,986,5.294871794871795
