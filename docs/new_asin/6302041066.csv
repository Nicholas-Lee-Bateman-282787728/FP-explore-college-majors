I was not able to watch it. It is not funny,it has gay references,and does not have a good story line. The Applegates has a good plot development and real comical scenes which are very functional. This is a functional comedy which would make anyone laugh. If it comes out on DVD I will buy it.

417719,5,6302041066,"Simply put, the Applegates are your typical nuclear family who wants nothing more than to nuke the human race.  Seems simple enough for a group of cockroaches from the bowels of the Amazon forest, but, alas, nothing is simple when Ed Begley Jr, Stockard Channing, and Dabney Coleman round out a cast that discovers being human is more difficult than imagined.  ""The Applegates"" was clever, funny, intelligent, poignant, and surprisingly shocking.  From the beginning, with a group of volunteers trying to teach natives over the rumble of urban sprawl in the Amazon, to the very fun ending that makes you want to clap your hands and jump in excess, ""The Applegates"" represented an old style of cinema that is deeply missed in modern theaters.  With a calling card that screams part ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and part the camp classic ""Amazon Women and the Avocado Jungle of Death"", it engulfs our social problems, our common idiosyncratic ways, and our hidden flaws with a pizzazz that cannot be found in today's films.  ""The Applegates"" boasts an amazing, if not obscure, cast, a powerful blend of humor with satire, and the most crucial element that is missed today - FUN.  One small three letter word that seems to evade comedy's of today.  From the beginning, I was hooked on this film, laughed for the first time in a while, and watched as the Applegates transformed, literally, from bug to human slime.

""The Applegates"" can easily be considered a cult classic for three obvious reasons; a strong cast, a powerful story, and moments that will remain in the chambers of your brain.  To begin, the cast is amazing.  Director Michael Lehmann,, who also directed a personal favorite film called ""Heathers"", knows how to make a socially viable comedy that doesn't feel dated or tired.  Watch ""Heathers"" again after watching ""Fight Club"", and you will see the possible similarities between two films made two decades apart.  He made this film using strong actors that typically would never be paired together at all.  Who would have imaged I would be sitting here, typing on the computer, indicating to you that I deeply enjoyed a film starring Ed Begley Jr. and Stockard Channing - or even the fact that Dabney Coleman was mixed in there as well?!?  This is a first for me.  ""The Applegates"" worked because the cast wasn't fighting from within.  They were working together to create comedy (yet again another concept that seems to escape modern cinematic farces), they played off of each other, building their small character into something believable and witty for the greater good - the movie!  It was impressive to watch them implode together, but it was equally as fun to see them outside of their element on their own.  Begley was dry and perfect for his role as the master-in-command bug, while Channing went through this amazing transformation from modest housewife to spending madman.  The same can be said for the two children, which go from bright and sunny to dark and sadistic midway through the film.  The human elements that invade these bugs' lives are over-developed for this film, but they work impressively well.  These Applegates, as well as the actors that portray them, prove to humans that even if they come to us, we will still destroy their sense of what is right or wrong.

""The Applegates"" used a powerful technique for keeping this film easy on the eyes.  It used the K.I.S.S. method that I believe helps comedies reach a higher level of repeated viewings.  The ""Keep It Simple Stupid"" was applied to this film by merely saying that these bugs were going to nuke a small town in the United States.  There wasn't a fear of technology, over-analyzing, or future consequences - and with a film like this, we didn't need it.  I wanted to laugh, bring in thoughts of what is destroying our world, and see a film that was fresh and genuine; and I was able to see it with ""The Applegates"".  The story was superb.  It was funny and poignant all at the same time.  The cast, which I have already applauded, makes this story come to life and seem more emotional than your typical big-budget cast with over-hyped budget.  This was a simple story, and due to the simplicity of the tale, my attention was focused and this film was enjoyed.  Where else could you not question Dabney Coleman dressed as ""Aunt Bea""?

Finally, the message that Lehmann was trying to release was clear.  There are problems in the United States whether we would want to blame them on outside influences or not, we have issues with underage pregnancies, drug use, over-spending, and adultery (perhaps every country does - but we seem to engulf it further).  This film exploits them on a group of bugs that gain our sympathies and force us to root for them when they are down.  Comedy is the tool used to show us our flaws, but our laughter is not ""HA HA HA"", but more of a ""ha"" as we consider our own lives within these bugs.  Metaphors abound, we feel sad for these Applegates as they begin to falter in their mission because we are causing the failure.  Our obese lifestyles are killing these bugs, and Lehmann isn't afraid to show us that to our face.

Overall, I thought ""The Applegates"" was yet another strong film released by Michael Lehmann.  It was sharp, witty, intelligent, and hysterical as this group of bugs learns what it is like to truly be human.  It is a sad story of our human lives, wondering if others would ever watch this film and see us in such a light, one can only wonder.  It is a passionate story, with a cast that will truly surprise you and make you question your own choices in life.  While it was released during a time where there was heightened fear of the destruction of the Amazon forests, while we battle today with the issue of Global Warming - the two seem to pair well - like a glass of white wine with a chicken salad.  ""The Applegates"" remains a poignant film, and I hope that it will one day see the light of DVD.  It needs to be seen by more, as we laugh, these issues need to be addressed.  HA.  Dabney Coleman dressed as ""Aunt Bea"".  HA!  I can't seem to get that out of my mind!

417720,4,6302041066,"Normally any movie about giant insects instantly turns me off, however ""Meet the Applegates"" is in an entirely different category by itself.  Imagine a family of giant mantis, who can disguise themselves as human, in a small american town on a mission to destroy a nuclear power plant to save the rainforest.  However, they have to hide their identities, overcome capitalistic greed, avoid mind-altering substances, and not allow themselves to look anything other than ""normal"".

This is your standard wholesome little town.  The local preacher is the voice of the people, and everyone meets in the town hall to determine how to handle an abnormal crisis.  Sure they have quite a mob mentality, but they're good people who care about their families.  I could never live in this wholesome american town, as they pride themselves too much on being ""normal"", even though there really is no way of defining ""normal"".  In fact this wholesome town is so normal that it's ridiculous.

If you hate giant insects... don't worry.  These are not the super-gross giant insects of horror films.  Instead the creative minds decided to makes the insects as cute as possible without being overly disgustingly cute.  The special effects are all done with plastic molding and firecracker explosions... yes your standard 80's comedy effects.  I hope they put this on DVD, as I have many friends who should give this a try.",1140825600,4,1403,5.0
7820073,5,6302041066,"The full title of this movie is ""Meet The Applegates."" This is an ecological movie right up there with ""Medicine Man"" (1992). Only this time the bugs are set on revenge or at least survival which means removing humans. The mission is to blow up a nuclear power plant. To do this they must look and act human. They start out statistically average. As they hold down the fort and wait the arrival of Aunt Bea, They learn more of the complexities of being human.

Ed Begley Jr. who played a misunderstood husband (bob) in ""She-Devil"" (1989), plays a well understood husband in this movie. Stockard Channing who played Rizzo in ""Grease"" (1978), Teaches us how to properly handle credit as the wife Jane Applegate. Dabney Coleman of ""9 to 5"" (1980) fame plays a ""queen"" Aunt Bea.

7820074,4,6302041066,"Very good  early 1990s B movie. We had this on VHS way back when it originally came out. I'm not sure how we wound up with our VHS copy other than buying a used former rental copy VHS at the local drug store that also had a VHS section. It's a weird, kitschy film. Very 1950s. It looks like the only way to see it now is to watch it on YouTube or buy a used VHS tape.  one of the strange things about looking this movie up is that  I found out that Ed Begley Jr who plays the Dad in this film has his own brand of environmentally friendly cleaning supplies called Begley's Best. It would be good to see Meet the Applegates released on DVD or another format again. I can't be the only one who would be interested in seeing it again.",1482019200,,731,3.993150684931507
7820075,5,6302041066,"Ok, don't judge me by my taste in movies, but this movie is awesome! I remembered seeing it as a teen when you still had to go to video stores to rent VHS tapes. Anytime I mentioned this amazing, low budget movie, no one knew what movie I was talking about. I was absolutely thrilled to find it on Amazon. Unfortunately it is only available as VHS. I bought one for myself and one for a friend. It's about an alien family that moves into the suburbs. It's a very weird, but wonderfully bad movie.",1447804800,,496,4.231578947368421
7820076,5,6302041066,"This order was a mistake. I thought I was ordering a DVD, but got a flawless VHS instead! Totally MY bad. I didn't read the offer correctly. It was right there: ""VHS"" in great big letters!  Oh well...need to wear my glasses, no matter how dorky I look! Anyway, I was at least pleasantly surprised by the VHS that I ended up with though. This VHS was in BRAND NEW CONDITION. luckily, I DO still have an old video cassette player. I drug it out, dusted it off and the tape played as good as it looked. The shipping was super fast. (Thank you Mr. Begley!) Even the sleeve was new looking. I don't know where Mr. Begley dug this old vid up, but it looks like it came straight out of a time capsule! Very pleased considering the circumstances. Those of you whom may like to see this really odd (but funny) video, you will find that it's not simple...or cheap. This particular video is very hard to come by because, The Applegates, aired on a channel that no longer exists, so the copies are few. Loved this show back in the day.",1445904000,,1023,4.27319587628866
7820077,5,6302041066,"Why haven't my friends seen or heard of this one? It's every bit a good a cult classic as ""Little Shop of Horrors"" or ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""..I find myself returning to it time and again for laughs-and the cultural emphasis on American consumerism. The Applegates are really gigantic insects from the Brazilian rain forest, on a mission to save their jungled dwelling from being cut down so they disguise themselves as Cleaver-ish residents of Normaltown, USA. The father, Dick (think of that old classic primer ""The New Guess Who"") becomes employed at the nuclear power plant as the family's mission is to take the nuke plant down in collaboration with their relative, ""Aunt Bea"" a drag queen with a Commando attitude. However, they find out just how hard it is to live a double life as insects in secret, humans in the public world. The typical American vices of consumerism, shopping addiction, extra-marital affairs, and drugs rear their ugly heads one by one. The son, Johnny, gets stoned, the daughter, Sally, has a date-rape run in with the neighbors' jock son, The wife/mother Jane, becomes a shopaholic and drinker and Dick is seduced by a sexy secretary or co-worker at the nuke plant. So a high price to pay for appearing ""normal"", yes? Hilarity ensues when the Applegates are selected as ""The Most Normal Family in America"" but then reality rears its ugly head when the  ""Cleaver-ish"" family shows their true ""insect"" selves to the photographers. The cocooning scenes are weird and bizarre in a comical way; Sally gets pregnant with a half-breed human/insect baby, the family dines on sugar and chocolate at the dinner table. As for the giant bugs they are in no way ""scary"" not so much as done for comedic intent. Don't know if this was classified as a ""B movie"" but I graded it an ""A"" in the funny department...now I really need to get it on dvd!!",1426723200,,1866,4.7592592592592595

7820079,1,6302041066,"Very sorry to disagree and be so negative, but I thought this was awful.  I understand it was supposed to be satire, but satire needs more than just a collection of tired and predictable jokes, with boring and predictable characters.  It especially needs characters you can like, or at least care about.  I didn't like these ""bug people,"" in fact, I disliked them.  The whole thing about ""American society"" came across like something a college sophomore might've found clever and hip, unaware that it was trite and had already been done to death.  It wasn't even up to the level of TV's ""3rd Rock from the Sun.""  This one goes into the trash.",1402704000,,642,4.6371681415929205

Meet the Applegates (1991) **
D: Michael Lehmann
C: Ed Begley, Jr., Stockard Channing, Dabney Coleman, Robert Jayne, Camille Cooper, Glenn Shadix, Susan Barnes, Roger Aaron Brown, Lee Garlington
P: Giant insects, disguised as humans, move to suburbia where dad obtains a job working at a nuclear power plant. Their mission is simple, blow up the power plant so they can rid the world of humans and so that they can live free once again in their true bug form.

Comparisons between this film and director Lehmann's previous effort, Heathers, are unavoidable since both films are satires on American culture. Unlike Heathers, Meet the Applegates lacks the tenacity to take direct aim at its subject.

There's a joke about how the queen bug follows the Applegates to Ohio disguised as Dabney Coleman, unaware that American women don't look nothing like Dabney Coleman. Initially seeing Coleman in drag is quite funny, but the joke grows quite tired, quite quick. It's a one note idea that is repeated over and over again and that pretty much surmises Meet the Applegates. Once the film is able to gets its point across, it is just left to repeat itself over and over again.

It's easy to understand why Meet the Applegates has become a minor cult classic. It's also easy to understand why the film would be a curio for some due to the fact that the main characters are giant insects disguised as humans. Oddly enough, I found myself entertained for most of its running time, though longing for something more.

Meet the Applegates delves into excess. Dad commits adultery. Mom becomes addicted to credit cards and materialism. Their daughter is date raped by a jock and becomes pregnant and their son dives head first into drugs & rock n' roll. The film is too low key, too laid back and too reserved in its overall approach. If you're going to make an outrageous satire involving giant bugs, you have to have the balls (so to speak) to follow through and attack the subject matter at hand.

Heathers had a certain ferocious, unrestrained quality to it. Heathers not only made you laugh, but it stung. In the process, it made you think. It challenged you and made you look within yourself. In an attempt to offend no one, Meet the Applegates is a diverting romp, nothing more. [R] 90 mins.

Filmed in 1989. Not released until 1991.",1387238400,,2370,4.737864077669903
