3144765,4,B0015HPS90,"Although not noted in the product description, this DVD has five films:
1. ""The Alphabet Conspiracy,"" hosted by Dr. Research (Frank Baxter)
2. ""The Time of Apollo,"" hosted by Burgess Meredith (30 minutes)
3. ""The Adventure of Junior Raindrop,"" by the US Forest Service
4. ""Way Stations in Space""
5. ""Why Study Science""

The first film concerns linguistic science and is presented from the viewpoint of a young girl struggling with English grammar rules.  Jabberwocky from ""Alice in Wonderland"" co-hosts with the Mad Hatter in this history of human languages from babies to adults.

The second film is a retrospect of the Apollo Moon program from Apollo 1 to Apollo 17.  It is an official NASA production for educational use.  The video and audio are excellent and the film has segments from the newscasts.  The disposal of the Moon flight support equipment to various museums is described.  Suitable for a brief overview of the Apollo program.

The third film is too corny for a Middle School class, but would be appropriate for kindergarten classes.  The story follows the adventures of a baby raindrop from sky to ocean and back to sky.

The fourth film is too rough (scratches, pops) to be used in a Middle School classroom.  A far, far better film for the same concept models would be the Walt Disney's ""Man in Space,"" ""Man And The Moon,"" and ""Mars And Beyond"" color episodes found on the Walt Disney Treasures - Tomorrowland DVD.  Disney's color version has better models, dialog, and action to keep Middle Schoolers spellbound even in 2012.  The Disney's version is hosted by NASA scientist Werner von Braun.  I usually follow up this 1959 version with Disney's remake of the same concept film (""Mission to Mars"") with Gary Sinise in 2002.  The latter film is very scientifically accurate and interesting.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walt-Disney-Treasures-Tomorrow-Land-Disney-in-Space-and-Beyond/dp/B0000BWVAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walt Disney Treasures - Tomorrow Land: Disney in Space and Beyond</a>

The fifth film is still valid for a Middle School classroom.  The film was created to encourage children of this age to study science to improve their lives in various occupations.  The film details the questions of two Eighth grade students to their parents about ""Why should I waste my time taking science classes in high school when I can always get a job without science?""
The parents explain how their grandparents studied farming to get a job, their parents studied automobile technology to get a job, and they study aviation technology to work in the flight industry.  The children will have to study science to work in the science industry.

3144766,5,B0015HPS90,"Dr. Frank Baxter was a professor at USC but was also on call to the local entertainment industry.  Many of us of a certain age grew up on the ""Bell Telephone"" educational films that feature the avuncular and cerebral Dr. Baxter.  Happily, they were so well done in their day that much of what they had to offer is still valuable.

The Alphabet Conspiracy was something of a departure from their usual fare with the inclusion of a ""dream sequence"" that allowed live actors instead of cartoon characters to be ""foils"" to Dr. Baxter's tutelage.  One of the actors was Hans Conreid, a talented veteran actor and voice talent of the day, who is delightful as always.

The purpose of the Alphabet Conspiracy program is to describe the value and purpose of language and linguistics.  It is fairly dense with information, but they do an excellent job balancing entertainment and pedagogy.

This is one of a small series of films that has only in the last couple of years come to DVD, and I am thrilled that they have.  I use these films in my own classes, even though their pacing and density of information, as well as their ""dated"" look, often put off my students.  Nevertheless, when quizzed, students do take away some significant insights, which is a testimony to the presentation.

I hope others will want to explore these and other titles with Dr. Frank Baxter, and to keep them alive to inspire not only future scientists but future educators.",1280448000,2,1443,4.690476190476191

They make science accessible to everyone and were some of my first memories of getting ""into"" science.  Although a tad outdated in visuals and dialoge, these Bell Lab videos hold up pretty well.  We need more of this type of educational feature on TV and in the classrooms, especially since the US has fallen so far behind the rest of the world in science and math.  The principles and basic information are the same.  The only admonishment I have is the prevailent smoking of Richard Carlson.  Get these for your children and watch them together.

This Bell Science special manages to entertain and inform. This time the topic is language with Dr. Frank C. Baxter who was an English professor at the University of Southern California.
