8053472,5,B0007XLFE0,"It was a good christian film, it made me realize, how we take worshiping god, and not sharing the gospel for granted.",1462320000,,117,4.363636363636363
8053473,5,B0007XLFE0,A great movie to share with the youth at Church. Gives them a real understanding of our freedoms in America.,1416528000,,108,4.45
8053474,5,B0007XLFE0,Voice of the Martyrs always put out great videos. This is a great gift for a teen's birthday or Christmas if they're Christian and have no idea of how privileged they are to be able to practice their faith without putting their life at risk. Makes one appreciate what we have in Christ more.,1382832000,,291,4.407407407407407
8053475,5,B0007XLFE0,"This movie is great for telling others about churches in forieign countries that are being terribly persecuted;it's also good for strengthening a Christian's faith and emboldening them to tell others about Jesus,and how he died on the cross to save us from our sins so that,through him,we may have everlasting life in heaven.",1381708800,,325,5.150943396226415
8053476,5,B0007XLFE0,This movies shows a little bit of how hard it is to preach the gospel in china.  it teaches about the underground churches and how easy we have it in America.,1375747200,,158,4.096774193548387
8053477,4,B0007XLFE0,"This is a likeable film, as with a lot of Christian films, the acting is not stellar.  But this one actually was bearable.  The first half of the film is mostly the main character narrating.  Which at first is a little tiresome.  However, once the plot really gets going the movie is quite enthralling.  It focuses on some Christians in China and how the American girl unwittingly reveals crucial information about them to the Chinese Secret Police.  Through a series of circumstances, she's able to convince her father to take some potentially damaging to the Chinese government pictures and so they are able to use the pictures as a bargaining chip.  The movie leaves one feeling refreshed and convicted to help one's fellow Christian.",1331424000,,737,4.895161290322581
8053478,5,B0007XLFE0,"I could tell that this movie was ""Low Budget"", but it was a good one! Especially showing the persecution of Christians in other countries!

8053479,5,B0007XLFE0,"This DVD is great for anyone interested in learning a little about what it is like to live in a communist country, without many of the freedoms that are too often taken for granted in many Western countries.
I think Abbey said it best at the end: ""I think that the problem is that so many Christians in the West just don't know what's going on in countries like China.  We live our own lives thousands of miles away, and it's just too easy to close our eyes to what they go through.""",1145232000,5,483,4.193548387096774
