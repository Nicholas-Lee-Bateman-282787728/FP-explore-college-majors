The Cebu song, and Mr. Lunt's Cheeseburger Love Song are classics.  it's too bad there's no Pirates Who Don't Do Anything II...",1003363200,,298,4.481481481481482

It features a bunch of silly songs from other movies, that'll get you singing along with the lyrics at the bottom of the screen. You'll also get to watch the video clips where the song was featured! The plot is great, too, as Larry feels rejected after the ""Cebu"" incident with Archibald Asparagus and wonders if he will ever get to be his silly self again. Will he?

Like the first Veggie Tales Sing-Along, kids of all ages will thrill to the music and animation, and adults will also enjoy the tongue-in-cheek humor.  The video cleverly spoofs the famous ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" painting and (in the grand tradition of the early Warner Brother cartoons) is clearly written on multiple levels.

Cebu is of course inspired andall the songs are great.  This video took a little longer to grow on me than the original silly song video, but it is now my favorite over the first tape!  Cheeseburger is fantastic and was my son's first song he attempted to imitate.
One of the neatest things about VeggieTales is that they include a lot of subtle humor that keeps adults laughing right along with the kids.",978480000,,533,4.648936170212766

7797381,5,1571324127,"Could this be the end of silliness?!?

Yes, it's true.  In a fit of moral outrage, Archibald Asparagus has canceled ""Silly Songs with Larry!""

Join the story in this fast paced sing-along collection as we find Larry the Cucumber drowning his sorrows in Jimmy Gourd's ice cream parlor.  Can Jimmy cheer up our forlorn cucumber?  Will Archibald ever forgive Larry and give him his songs back?  Most importantly, how much ice cream can a cucumber eat before he gets one of those really bad headaches?

Sing yourself silly with some of your favorite VeggieTales songs and find the answer to the question everyone is asking -- is this... The End of Silliness?",1197936000,4,654,4.785714285714286

I am not religious, in fact I've never been in a church, but that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy these silly songs.  They are entertaining for people of all religions, and even all ages!  These songs get stuck in your head, but that's not a bad thing because they'll make you happy whenever you hum them.  This video includes songs like ""Keep Walking"", ""Song of the Cebu"", and others.  I have some of these songs on my iTunes and I even know people who are older than me that also have these songs.  This video is creative and funny so if you give it a chance I think you will like it.",1151366400,,686,3.9635036496350367

Great movie and great songs! Definately recommend.

7797385,1,1571324127,"My 3 yr old son loves veggie tales, however, I am very dissapointed with this one. In the beginning larry is in a cafe, it is late at night and the cafe is empty, he is sitting at a table crying hitting his head on the  table, the waiter, says hey buddy are you okay? And it just gets worse from here. The wallowing in crying, and sadness continues throughout the entire movie. It takes places, the entire movie, while larry cries sitting at this booth, reflecting on past veggie tales episodes played on the restaurant juke box, the past epsisodes are good, but my son couldn't get past, momma Larry sad. What's wrong momma? It was not a good veggie tale. So basically this movie is a bunch of snippets of other veggie tales movies w/Larry crying in between the snippets at a restaurant booth hitting his head on the table.",1113091200,2,824,4.421052631578948
7797386,5,1571324127,"This is the best silly-song collection they have made.  They put many great, toe-tapping songs on it.  It is also really funny to have it set in a soda shop, with Larry drowning his woes, after being fired from silly-songs, in ice cream sodas.  He tells his story to the soda shop employee, who tries to help him.  Very, Very funny, with a good ending and a new silly song.",1101772800,3,373,4.285714285714286
7797387,4,1571324127,"Larry the Cucumber is drowning out his sorrows at Jimmy Gourd's ice cream parlor. Why? Because Archibald Asparagus has canceled ""Silly Songs with Larry"", the part of VeggieTales where 'Larry the Cucumber sings a silly song'! As we learn this story of how this happens, we get to listen and sing-along with a collection of songs which Jimmy plays to cheer up Larry. The songs include ""The Song of the Cebu"", ""Promised Land"", ""Good Morning George"", ""The Thankfulness Song"", ""Keep Walking!"", ""Big Things, Too"", ""Stuff Mart Rap"", ""His Cheeseburger"", and ""The Yodeling Veterinarian of the Alps"". Will Jimmy be able to get Larry back on his feet (if he has any)? Will Archibald forgive Larry? Will Larry get to sing his silly songs again, or is this... the end of silliness?
The songs were fun, the story was interesting, the characters were funny... yet I didn't get such a kick out of it as I do in ""The Ultimate Silly Songs Countdown"". The best songs were ""Keep Walking!"" (sung hilariously by the French Peas), ""Promised Land"" ('We're going to the Promised Land!'), ""Big Things, Too"" (a nice jazzy song), and ""Stuff-Mart Rap"" ('Bungee, Bungee, Bungee-wungey-fun-gey'). Maybe I liked ""The Ultimate Silly Songs Countdown"" better because it had really Larry's Silly Songs while this tape has only three Silly Songs. Oh, well, I still love watching Larry mope at the ice-cream parlor! I love it how he beats his head on the table! Also seeing Larry and Archibald make faces at each other was so funny! Archibald's glowing speech was pretty great, too (except it ends sort of abruptly).
If you liked this VeggieTale, don't miss out on ""King George and the Ducky"", ""Larry-Boy and the Fib from Outer Space"", and as I've mentioned numerous times, ""The Ultimate Silly Songs Countdown"", the three VeggieTales videos which are my favorites.",1018137600,8,1826,4.931818181818182
