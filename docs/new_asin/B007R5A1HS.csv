5105121,5,B007R5A1HS,"This collection is worth the cost just for Game 5 of The 1980 NLCS against the Astros. It was one of the all time classic playoff games in history. In Fact, the entire set is worth adding to the collection. The 1993 NLCS clincher against The Braves provides Phillies and basbeall fans with another game from an era in baseball that is just now starting to appear on MLB dvd collections. Halladay's no hitter in NLDS gives fans an awesome piece of baseball history to watch again and again. The only dud on the set is the 2008 World Series clincher against the Rays. While it was a great game, it has already appeared on a previous collection. However, it is still a classic set that any baseball fan will enjoy.",1337731200,4,711,4.435114503816794

8521206,5,B007R5A1HS,"This 4 dvd collection allows you to see in action the best PHILLIES teams since 1980. You have the WORLD SERIES champions of 1980;the 1993 team fondly remembered by the fans with DYKSTRA and KRUK;and of course the 2008 WORLD SERIES champions with another extension two years later. The only thing missing is a STEVE CARLTON game from 1972,the year he won half of the games of the PHILLIES.You can't go wrong with this set if you are a PHILLIE fanatic. Feels funny to hear HOWARD COSSELL in 1980. Memories are made of these.",1453939200,2,523,4.574468085106383
8521207,3,B007R5A1HS,It should have had the whole 1980 series with Houston included......that was one of the best if not the best series ever played,1438732800,,127,4.565217391304348
8521208,4,B007R5A1HS,Wish it had Game 6 of the 1980 World Series. Also I wish it had a few more games in the overall package. Clinching against the Dodgers in 1983. The game in Montreal that they clinched the NL East. When will MLB release all of the 1980 NLCS?,1431993600,,240,4.020833333333333

8521210,5,B007R5A1HS,"These are a must for Phillies enthusiasts, young and old fans. Really good restoration of the 80 & 93 playoff games.",1360713600,2,116,4.571428571428571
8521211,5,B007R5A1HS,"I own two games from the discs in this set, but to get the no-hitter in the playoffs is the reson I brought it. To have a piece of baseball history is the reason to buy this set.",1360627200,2,178,3.710526315789474
8521212,4,B007R5A1HS,"I purchased this set of DVDs for one game: Game 5 of the 1980 NLCS with Nolan Ryan pitching.  Then 33 year-old Ryan was clocked at 99 MPH in this game using a hand-held radar gun.  This would equate to 102-104 MPH with today's inflated for fan excitement stadium systems.  The quality of this game is good.  Hopefully, the entire 1980 NLCS will made available to the public someday.",1359763200,2,382,4.492753623188406
8521213,3,B007R5A1HS,Very disappointing this set includes two games that already been released on two previous editions before.  The 1980 NLCS clincher against Houston and game 5 of the 2008 World Series against Tampa.  I'm sure MLB could've easily found two other games to substitute instead.  Maybe Steve Carlton's 300th win or his original breaking the strike out record.  Howabout the dramatic way Mike Schmidt hit his 500th home run against Pittsburgh as examples of something original.  If they wanted to include something from 1980 howabout game 4 against Houston or the division clincher against Montreal.,1338163200,8,592,5.25531914893617
