8065752,2,B0009RQSJG,"I like to complement my BIBLE readings with BIBLE movies and have a very extensive BIBLE movie collection. SAMSON AND GIDEON (1966) includes two stories about 40 minutes each. The GIDEON story comes first and is very talky, The SAMSON story has more action, and the final scenes have some excitement. The quality of the print doesn't help: the picture is not crisp, has almost no color at all, and is quite dark! You may not be able to watch the whole GIDEON program because the acting is below average and the story moves very slowly. The SAMSON story could be given 3 stars, so the whole CD should be given 2 1/2 stars.",1490054400,,621,4.456140350877193

8065755,3,B0009RQSJG,"As a longtime judo practioner and fan of sport judo I've wanted to see this film for some time. Recently a friend purchased it for me from Amazon as a present. It stars Anton Geesink,the first non-Japanese to win the world judo championship,as the biblical strongman Samson. The herculean(6'6"" 260lb.)Geesink actually does a credible job portraying the tragic hero. The film itself is a retelling of the story of Samson and his betrayl at the hands of the temptress Delilah. Not done on the same epic scale as Cecil B.De Mille's classic starring Victor Mature this film and it's companion feature about Gideon seems to have been made for Sunday School audiences and not regular theatre patrons. It's still a good entertainment and it was interesting to see the Olympic and World Champion in action. It makes you wonder why no one thought to cast him in one of the gladiator-type movies that were popular at the time this film was being made.",1242950400,3,941,4.779141104294479
