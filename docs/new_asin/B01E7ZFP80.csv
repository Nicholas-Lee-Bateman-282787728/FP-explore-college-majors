8758021,5,B01E7ZFP80,"This version of Serail, Escape from the Harem, is distinctive for being, among other considerations, a conscious and determined attempt to produce the work in as close a way as possible to the concept imagined to be that envisioned by Mozart. Consequently an enormous level of care has been applied to matters of design, especially sets and costuming, This is copiously described and explained by the designer, Vicki Mortimer,in the interesting and very informative extra feature of this release. Also in that feature we hear from producer, David McVicar, who describes the intentions behind this production that aims to create an authentic drama as the composer would have imagined.

This information would make a recommended starting point for enhancing both understanding and enjoying this recording. The provided sleeve notes are also along the same lines but the visual presentation is far more involving with the supplied supporting visual examples.

This early work by Mozart is a Singspiel which is not the same as opera. A Singspiel is, in effect, a spoken drama with an additional sung element designed to enhance the drama. Spoken dialogue is therefore crucial to this essentially German art-form and is too often reduced, deleted or otherwise adapted in modern performances.

This Glyndebourne production, recorded in 2015, makes a determined decision and attempt to restore the dialogue as originally intended and in its entirety. This decision, delivered with complete conviction by the entire cast, has a considerable and positive effect upon the whole experience.

Needless to say, Mozart greatly extended the importance of the musical elements of this Singspiel which are especially used to deepen the emotional development of the characters as the plot develops. In this way the distinction between Singspiel and opera becomes less obvious and two genres overlap to a considerable extent.

Without wishing to abbreviate this review unduly, one can reasonably summarise this production as being a committed attempt to deliver an authentic visual and audio experience as the composer would have expected within his own era and context. This context, by making it clear that the Pasha is a Spaniard converted to being a Muslim, importantly cast as in the original drama, neatly crosses the cultural divide which makes this drama as relevant today as it was in Mozarts time. Mozarts use of Oriental effects such as various percussion and piccolo sounds are fully realised by the period Age of Enlightenment orchestra under the energetic leadership of conductor Robin Ticciati.

The entirely spoken part of the Pasha is convincingly played by Franck Saurel. The supporting role of Osmin is not played for laughs and thus is far more real dramatically rather than having a distracting and destructive comic role. Any dramatic amusement is appropriately provided by the English maid Blondes feisty dealings with both Osmin and Pedrillo, her intended. Osmin, Blonde and Pedrillo are all excellently delivered both musically and dramatically by Tobias Kehrer, Mari Eriksmoen and Brenden Gunnell respectively.  Sally Matthews is cast in the musically stand-out role of Konstanze and she does not disappoint during any of her highly demanding arias.  The dramatically weaker role of Belmonte is well-taken by Edgaras Montvidas. The whole cast is simply outstandingly fine in all musical and dramatic considerations.

The actual recording is a state-of-the-art experience from Opus Arte with vivid and convincing visuals, involving but not invasive camera work all supported with fine sound presented in default DTS-HD 5.1 surround with a stereo option. Subtitles are provided in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean with the performance language being, correctly, in German. The disc is presented as All Regions.

This is an exceptional production, performance and recording and likely to be a first choice for numerous purchasers.",1476316800,18,3946,5.412052117263844
