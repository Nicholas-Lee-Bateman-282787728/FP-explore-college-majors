8278444,5,B001AOW6P2,"Basil Rathbone and Bobby Breen are too delightful in this movie about a boy (Bobby Breen) who meets a a talented and ever so handsome composer(Basil Rathbone), during his summer vacation. I give this movie 5 stars because it is made just right. Good acting, good songs, sweet story without being soppy, overall, a fun movie. Rent it from Netflix though, because the audio is out of sync on amazon instant view, and I found the overall sound and picture better with the rented disc from Netflix.
 Give ""Make A Wish"" a try, because you will be glad you did!",1342742400,,555,4.55
8278445,3,B001AOW6P2,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

According to imdb, total running time for this double feature is 147 minutes. That 90 on the product description may be a typo.

Bobby Breen had a stellar (if brief) movie career: eight starring roles from 1936 to '39, plus one final 1942 appearance (in ""Johnny Doughboy"") along with other former child phenoms Jane Withers, Spanky McFarland and Alfalfa Switzer. In his youthful prime, Bobby was the most famous boy singer of the 1930s, performing songs in English, French, Italian and Spanish.

The soprano-voiced Canadian-born Breen got his start in nightclubs at age 7, appeared on the Eddie Cantor radio show in 1936 and quickly moved on to Hollywood. Four short years later with the onset of puberty, Bobby suffered the fate of many child stars-- his remarkable career was virtually over. In 1967, the Beatles used his image in their celebrity collage on the ""Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" album cover.
