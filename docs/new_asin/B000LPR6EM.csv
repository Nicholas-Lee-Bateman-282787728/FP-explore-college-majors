2711894,3,B000LPR6EM,"I'm not going to comment on the show itself, just the DVD set.
The bonus features left a lot to be desired.  It was basically a montage of Janice having some temper tantrums, which might be amusing to some, but got old quickly to me.  The clips were taken out of context of the whole argument, so you didn't really know what was going on which did not make it interesting.  I was hoping for something with more depth, such as more interviews with the clients or models.
That being said, this review is not for anyone who isn't familiar with the show, but people who are wondering if the DVD set is worth it.  If the bonus features would be a deciding factor for you, I say forgo buying this set.  But if you want it anyways, go for it.",1203465600,3,735,4.184397163120567
2711895,3,B000LPR6EM,"If the goal was set up clearly right at the beginning to create a Top Modelling Agency which creates Top Models, then a highly professional team will be needed. Certainly you can feel it is not there yet in season 1.

One of the main reasons i was interested into watching this show is because they have BOTH female and male contestents.

Plus one piece of advice to the producers not necessarily to this show, but to ALL other similar shows - Truly put the contestents right in the centre of the show, not the people who are already famous!",1200700800,,541,4.4

SO FAR I ENJOYED THE FIRST 3 EPISODES CAUSE THIS GIRL IS REAL!! & THE WAY JANICE IS SHOWING HOW HARD IT IS TO GET TO THE MODELING BUSINESS IN HER SHOW, BELIVE ME,THAT'S THE WAY IT IS EXCEPT FOR THE PART WHERE JANICE HUGS THE NOT CHOSEN ONES GOOD-BYE!! I'M WRITING THIS CAUSE MY COUSIN WENT THROUGH ALL THAT PAIN IN ORDER TO BE AN INTERNATIONAL MODEL SINCE THE U.S. WASN'T BUYING OR FEELING WHAT HE HAD IN STORE!!

I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE SEASON 2 RELEASED ON DVD TOO!!!!",1170720000,4,592,4.139130434782609
8163105,5,B000LPR6EM,Although it has TV-14 on the case it does show mature scenes. I am not disappointed anymore. Thanks.,1498003200,,100,4.611111111111111

8163107,5,B000LPR6EM,I loved watching this series on tv so when I found it on DVD i had to get it. She is so funny to watch. I am heavily satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this show to everyone who likes reality TV.,1484697600,,207,3.8372093023255816

8163110,5,B000LPR6EM,This DVD was awesome. I don't understand why the studios didn't release the other season(s).  How could anyone not love Janice Dickinson. She is the Simon Cowell of the modeling world. She keeps it real yet it was nice to see her act very protective and motherly towards her staff.  She didn't take any bull and she pushed her staff to be the best because she believed in them . . .and she wants her agency to make money of course!  Great show!!!,1277078400,,446,4.349397590361446
8163111,3,B000LPR6EM,"Not really sure why I like this series.  Janice is so ridiculously rude that her behaviour can only be for the benefit of the camera.  It's like a car accident in that I can't turn away! It's also an interesting look at people's reactions to such behaviour and how much they're willing to put up with for the sake of being on TV and/or hopefully launching their own career in the industry.

I think the thing that disturbs me the most is how apparent it is that Janice's bust is silicone.  She dresses to shock and she really shouldn't.  They're so obviously fake (I'm not just being catty, take a look for yourself) that she should be covering them up rather than letting it all hang out. But whatever... it's her body.  She paid a lot for it and obviously likes it so who am I to judge?

Can't say that this is a great series, yet I don't hate it.  It's kinda weird.",1231459200,,868,4.25
8163112,1,B000LPR6EM,"Ordered this item June 10th and as of December 12th, I still have not received it.  E-mails to the customer service department of this company go unanswered.  This is why I choose to buy from Amazon directly.  This vendor is terrible.",1229040000,,234,4.658536585365853
8163113,3,B000LPR6EM,"People who became fans of this show after the first season ended should be aware that the first season is quite different than subsequent episodes.  Yes, Janice was already showing her hot-and-cold, sometimes sweet, sometimes venemous personality, but the show's models were generally much less attractive when the show first started out.  In addition to there being fewer exceptionally beautiful people in season one, there was also a lot less flesh shown.  While I've often been a bit surprised by how far this show has gone in terms of nudity in subsequent episodes, the first season is hardly titillating at all.

I love this show's later episodes because Janice is hysterical and the men are hot (and usually at least half-naked), but this first season is honestly a bit dull.",1210550400,6,781,4.984615384615385
8163114,4,B000LPR6EM,"I accidentially turned this show on and I didn't want to like it, but I was quickly hooked. I know Janice would tell me to shape-up my fat fanny, but, I can't help but to like Janice! She's definitely one dynamic, outgoing and flashy lady!

First, I must say that I don't agree with everything Janice says or does, but- I do admire & envy her self confidence. She has brass, brains and a compassionate side. Janice is like an egg, a hard protective shell with a soft inside. It makes for a roller coaster ride of a show. She does care about many of her girls and guys. Tho, Janice just says what she thinks- period. While you might think her mean in areas, she does know what it takes to make it in the fashion industry. She has a good eye on picking out potential models. Tho, I don't agree with everything she does morally, but hey, that's life!

This isn't brain candy, it's a reality show. The show basically just follows casting calls and photo shoots of the Janice Dickinson modeling agency and the various models. It also follows the challenges faced by the models. Weight issues, inhibition issues, moral issues and yes, at times there is lots of skin shown, especially during casting calls. Janice is right you have to have sexuality to be a model. Also in Europe nudity isn't such a big taboo like it is in the USA. Face it- sexuality sells products! It's interesting to see how the different fashion companies and magazines pick out the faces and bodies they want representing their products.

One reason I didn't give this show 5 stars is that I'd like less of the models personal lives shown. This show will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're easily offended or if you don't like Janice's antics, I wouldn't recommend it.

Bottom line it's a must see if you're a Janice Dickinson fan or a fashion fan. It's one crazy show!",1210464000,6,1851,4.483679525222552
