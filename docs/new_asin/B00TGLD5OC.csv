8701654,5,B00TGLD5OC,My daughter loves Mickey. The episodes all revolve around animals which is a big hit in our house as well.,1530835200,,106,4.35
8701655,3,B00TGLD5OC,"I got this because my child discovered Mickey and Minnie, as they are branded on everything, and really likes the animated Christmas stories. I didn't know until seeing this that Disney makes crap. The CG looks like it's from 2000 and the production value is low.
The episodes are all the same and run together so you can't tell them apart. For a parent it's annoying as these little jingles and sayings get stuck in your head. And for some reason Mickey uses names that sound like Iron Curtain code names, Miska, Moska, and Mooseka, such as the kitten names from the pet store and his code to start the show or whatever Mickey is doing when he chants this. Not sure what it means.
It's so bright though and the characters bounce and bob in a hypnotic way that it seems to really captive kids. The shows are designed as if the kids will interact with it but they do not. They all sort of sit there with blank expressions staring and I'm expecting drool at any moment. I'm including this with my experience of my nieces and nephews watching it. This show is so much dumber than anything else my child is interested in. If you want your kids distracted enough so you can do something uninterrupted this is for you. But it may also temporarily lower their IQ. And have other annoying and unintended side effects.",1529712000,,1309,4.481171548117155

8701658,5,B00TGLD5OC,Very good movie,1523664000,,15,4.333333333333333
8701659,5,B00TGLD5OC,"I would give this DVD about a 4, but my granddaughter, Anna, loves it, and I do think it is very well organized.  So the five stars is what I think Anna would rate it if she were older.  Clever using the characters animals in the pet show. I should probably give it another viewing to specifically look for what I liked about it, or what I would do to improve it.  Thanks, product was worth buying.",1520121600,,398,4.142857142857143
