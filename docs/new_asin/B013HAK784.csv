8727649,5,B013HAK784,"Wow. What a show.

Johnny Gargano vs Tommaso Ciampa - ***1/4
Started out average but they cooked out a hot finishing run.
Joey & Candice vs Monster Mafia - ***
Very fun match. Josh's farewell with a shocking turn at the end.
Biff Busick vs Timothy Thatcher - **1/2
Too short to mean anything.
Roderick Strong vs Mike Bailey - ****1/4
Amazing match. Speedball is becoming a star.
Brian Cage vs John Silver - **3/4
Fun little match, may have went a tad too long.
Chris Hero vs Zack Sabre Jr - ****1/2
Brutal in the most pure form. A true MOTY candidate.
Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee vs The Young Bucks - ***3/4
Crazy match, as you'd expect.

The end of the show saw the formation of Mount Rushmore 2.0 and while it can be seen on YouTube, I'd argue that it's a must own on DVD. Epic moment with the return of Super Dragon.",1440547200,,819,4.243589743589744
8727650,4,B013HAK784,"The theme of this event was that it was the third time in history that the card or talents were never advertised leading up to the event so all the matches would be a complete mystery to the crowd throughout the night.

P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee made their debuts against each other at the previous Mystery Vortex event & they tried to rekindle the magic here before being interrupted by the Young Bucks, who were in Japan the previous day, leading to a tag title match that saw both teams executing some double team offense & aerial moves while one team singled out an injured body part with the bigger story here being whom decided to get physically involved in the match including a long awaited return.  P.W.G. Champion Roderick Strong faced off against ""Speedball"" Mike Bailey with Bailey using his fast educated feet throughout the match while Strong used continuous impactful offense both in & outside of the ring.  Other matches include Tamasso Ciampa vs. Johnny Gargano that saw both men fighting in the crowd taking out the first few rows along with executing impactful moves using all areas of the ring, World's Cutiest Tag Team vs. Monster Mafia in one of Josh Alexander's final matches that saw both teams take as much as they gave, Chris Hero vs. Zack Zaber Jr. in a submission based bout that saw both men trying to hurt each other & one man focusing on a specific injured body part, Biff Busick vs. the debuting Timothy Thatcher with both men using a heavily based submission style focusing specifically on the joints of the body to the point where the winner won by a chokeout, and the debuting John Silver vs. Brian Cage.

You can't go wrong with P.W.G. & this was a standout event that definitely left a lasting impression at the end of the night that's worth checking out.",1440288000,,1820,4.642857142857143
