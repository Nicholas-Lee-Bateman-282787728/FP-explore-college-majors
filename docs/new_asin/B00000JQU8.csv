1236430,2,B00000JQU8,"I found this very slow-moving, with some scenes (that I didn't find particularly interesting in the first place) dragging on interminably...and I wasn't wowed by Judy Garland's vocal abilities either. She was good in ways, with a powerful voice and tremolo, but she didn't have much of a range and I didn't find her a particularly pleasant singer to *watch*. This movie did make me think of looking into her story though. I know the rough outline, but now would like to know more. Maybe when I do I'll be more enamored of her performances (or maybe not)...",1511481600,,556,4.683673469387755

George Cukor), which tried to repair and replace most of the large amount of material Warner Bros. had hacked out of it before its initial presentation.  Despite clean-ups the restored material is a little rough, but the story is still a classic and the songs great, including the iconic ""The Man That Got Away"" by Harold Arlen.  James Mason is a strong co-star, but nobody could top Judy Garland's incandescent performance in this rags-to-riches story.  Recommended to any student of movies.",1505433600,,570,5.042553191489362

The musical numbers are well staged and the performances of Miss Garland are stellar.  It's a shame that the general public never saw the director's cut.

I see some reviews here that state that there are stills and just audio in the beginning of the movie.  This is just to fill in the gaps where Warner Bros. butchered this classic film.  Be patient and sit through it.  It's not that long and so well worth it to see Judy Garland come alive, especially The Man that Got Away and Born in a Trunk number.",1484092800,,434,4.320987654320987

The parallel to her own fate is striking, but there's a twist: the role of the substance abuser (""Norman Main"") is James Mason's, not hers.  The real-life counterparts of Judy's character, who loves Main and tries desperately to cope with his fatal weakness, are her second daughter, Lorna Luft, and her son, Joey Luft.",1482883200,,438,5.154929577464789
1236458,5,B00000JQU8,"In the popular consciousness, this film has withstood the test of time to remain the most applauded of the three ""A Star is Born"" iterations and an undisputed cinema classic. Watching it 62 years after its initial release, one can easily see why the movie still resonates.

Audiences who flocked to ""A Star is Born"" in the mid-1950s must have been a bit surprised, because this is not at all like the happy, upbeat musicals that made Judy Garland a superstar in the late-1930s and '40s. This film has plenty of glamor and swank, like Garland's previous vehicles, but the entire tone is sultry, ironic, and self-reflective. In 'A Star is Born,' Hollywood essentially takes an unflinching look at itself in the mirror, only to find its image clouded with the midnight bar-room smoke of regret, booze, cynicism, falsehood, triumph, and destruction.

Not exactly a ""Come on, kids, let's put on a show!"" cakewalk.

Garland clearly wanted to showcase all of her tremendous abilities for a big screen comeback, so this property must have been especially alluring to her and then-hubby/manager/producer, Sid Luft. As Esther Blodgett, a waifish California band-singer with big dreams to match her big voice, Garland got to sink her teeth into a character that let her run the gamut of onscreen emotional projection; she is by turns funny, somber, gregarious, shy, confident, tremulously insecure, whimsical, self-loathing, hopeful, and fraught with despair. In terms of her acting alone, Garland is never less than riveting. You always believe her, just like you did as a kid when she and Toto landed in Oz for their adventures.

Co-star James Mason plays Norman Maine, the dapper and established Hollywood movie star who ""discovers"" Esther after she gamely saves him from making a drunken fool out of himself on-stage at a ritzy Hollywood benefit. Mason's performance is every bit as captivating as Garland's, even if his nuanced, subtly agonized portrayal of an unraveling soul comes without the benefit of song-and-dance numbers. A perfectly chosen supporting cast (Charles Bickford as studio-boss Oliver Niles, Tommy Noonan as high-powered publicist ""Libby"") makes for an ideal nest from which Garland and Mason can take flight with their performances. Indeed, Los Angeles itself is perhaps the third ""big star"" of this movie. From skies ablaze with klieg lights to seedy after-hours jazz clubs, from movie studio offices to drowsy rooming-houses, from palatial oceanside haciendas to rickety motels on the edge of the desert, the city radiates or reflects the moods and misfortunes of Esther and Norman as the serendipitous glee of whirlwind romance gives way to inevitable tragedy. You can practically smell the city due to director George Cukor's sweeping, decadent cinematography. He clearly desired to capture the genuine ambience of life in 1950s Hollywood and succeeds in a way few others have been able to duplicate.

The screen play by Moss Hart is outstanding; there's not a throwaway line in the film (even if chunks of the film itself were recklessly thrown away shortly after its release) and the story moves along engagingly, given its nearly 3-hour running time. Today's first-time viewers should be warned that, in the process of the film's ongoing restoration, significant portions of the story that had been cut by studio-head Jack Warner to pare-down its length have been replaced by a montage of stills displayed over the dialogue soundtrack. We are able to get a much better sense of the plot due to this device, but it's a not-quite-sufficient remedy, and the infamous ""butchering"" of 'A Star is Born' remains a crime against classic cinema, with all the evidence for a swift conviction on hand.

Of course, the greatest and most obvious element of the film is Judy Garland's delivery of the Harold Arlen/Ira Gershwin score. She was the biggest singing movie star of her time, and this picture was made to drive that point successfully home. In 'A Star Is Born,' Garland's charcacter does not break-out into song spontaneously, as if tunes were dialogue and she were worrying her way down a yellow-brick road with frightened pals. The songs here emerge realistically, e.g. when Norman finds Esther singing with the band in a motheaten supper-club, when Esther's film debut is being screened, when Esther rehearses with the studio orchestra, etc. Garland's musical performance alone is staggering, and she introduces at least two all-time standards with 'The Man That Got Away' and the stunning (if perhaps just a bit overlong) 'Born in a Trunk' sequence. Moviegoers who wanted Judy Garland singing at the top of her powers were certainly not disappointed by this picture.

As implied earlier, the restoration of this film comprises a drama all by itself. Filmed in Cinemascope, it colors are wet with richness and depth, even though Cukor makes some careless little mistakes, here and there. All in all, 'A Star is Born' is a classic that every serious film-aficionado should own and treasure, if only for the great Garland's definitive, powerhouse performance. No singing star before or since has brought such a tempest of diversified talent (singing, crooning, dancing, comedy, pathos, tragedy, triumph) to the equation in a single movie. Watch it with a thoughtful eye and you'll soon agree with Groucho Marx, who commented after Garland lost the Best Actress Oscar to Grace Kelly: ""This is the biggest robbery since Brinks.""",1482883200,,5445,5.131905298759865

However, I was also expecting a happy ending, and in this my expectations went unmet. This was not to the detriment of the film; I just simply wasn't expecting a commentary on Hollywood life, or a treatise on the juxtaposition between the garish world of filmmaking and the private lives of stars. Given Judy Garland's issues with depression and suicide shortly before this film was released, it seemed half autobiographical. And, given what you can see on TMZ today as well as hearing actors say how much they value privacy, I imagine this film is quite realistic even sixty years after its debut. It will make you think differently about Hollywood, as well as the way actors and other public figures are so harshly scrutinized.

1236634,3,B00000JQU8,"Although I thought this a fine movie in the past, my most recent viewing shows a change in my reaction. It seems a rather melodramitic film  in which Judy Garland, somewhat unbelievably, plays the 'martyer/quietly supportive/I'll sacrifice myself for my man"" lead, to James Mason's well done ""I can't be in movies anymore but my wife is at the TOP of her game"" alcholic husband.

Garland's performance doesn't ring true, and one has to ask, does everybody have to be a 'star' in order to have a meaningful life??? But Mason is very good as the neurotic husband, despite the rather soap opera atmosphere.

The ending still is sad..........

It seems a sort of celebration of the victimized wife who is, through her sacrificing herself for her husband gains everyone's admiration blah blah blah.....",1416096000,,797,4.925373134328358

Yes, failures and dreams dashed upon the rocks of our hopes.

1236636,4,B00000JQU8,"I bought this film because I had only seen the 1937 Janet Gaynor and Frederic March version (of which I am very partial).
The pairing of March and Gaynor, offers a more sentimental and rather schmaltzy portrayal of the characters. Even the musical background in the scene where Esther Boldgett's grandma sees her off at the train station was Old Lang Syne, and I used half a box of Kleenex before half the movie was over....
Judy Garland and James Mason's characters are little more complex and the film is very 50's. I thought Judy Garland looked great in all of her scenes and of course her musical numbers are fantastic...I particularly loved her in the after hours club scene singing The Man that got Away. For years Judy looked emaciated and strained in the face, but here she looks of average weight and her acting is perfection as always.
James Mason's portrayal of Norman Maine seemed a bit staid at first, but then you become accustomed to his vocal cadence and become immersed in the story completely.  Jack Carson adds some humor as the sarcastic press agent Libby. There are snippets of film missing in several of the scenes which have been replaced with movie stills and the audio dialogue is heard in the background corresponding with the missing frame action.
This worked for me and didn't detract from the overall film. If you are a fan of Judy Garland you will definitely enjoy this film.
It has historical significance because James Mason delivered Garland's eulogy.",1414627200,,1484,4.77431906614786

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: To many of us, okay, to most of us, Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the wide-eyed, spunky, achingly sincere, and forever appealing heroine of the all-time classic, 'The Wizard of Oz.' But as much as that timeless portrayal, not to mention her sublime and iconic rendition of the Oscar-winning ""Over the Rainbow"" has firmly cemented itself into our collective consciousness, it's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the peerless talent of the great Judy Garland. For many singer-actresses, such a monumental film would have been their professional pinnacle, an apex that could never be rivalled or equalled, but not for Judy Garland. For her 'The Wizard of Oz' was merely the point of embarkation for a staggering career unrivalled in its breadth and level of success. Films were only one of the domains Judy Garland conquered. She also made her mark on radio, television, the recording industry, and perhaps most significant of all, the concert stage. The consummate entertainer, who could sing, dance, and act with equal aplomb, Judy Garland often showed off her triple-threat abilities in a variety of memorable M-G-M musicals from 1939 to 1950, but never to such stupendous effect than in director George Cukor's 1954 remake of the definitive Hollywood heartbreak tale, 'A Star Is Born.'

Based on the 1937 drama of the same name starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, which itself was inspired by the 1932 film 'What Price Hollywood?' and of course 'A Star Is Born' tells the story of one film career on the rise and one in decline, and how the excess and narcissism of Tinsel town often lead to isolation, alienation, despair, and destruction. Ironically, Judy Garland, one of Hollywood's most famous casualties, portrays the level-headed rising star, Esther Blodgett, a struggling band singer discovered and groomed by waning matinee idol Norman Maine [James Mason], an alcoholic actor who coasts on charm and whose drunken escapades have made him an unreliable commodity. The two fall in love, but Norman's addiction and mounting insecurities over his slipping career continually test both their relationship and Norman's tenuous hold on a stable existence.

At the time of its release, 'A Star Is Born' was one of the few films to depict the dark side of Hollywood, proving all that glitters is not gold, and its uncompromising and at times unflattering portrait of an often heartless industry and parasitic culture packed a solid punch. Today, it's widely considered to be the best version of the oft-told tale thanks to George Cukor's sensitive yet straightforward direction, which perfectly balances the script's rich emotional fabric. Though the Moss Hart screenplay still glosses over some of Hollywood's harsher elements (after all, the industry couldn't be expected to expose all its warts), we get enough of an inside look at studio practices and politics, some of which are delightfully lampooned to give us a solid sense of what moviemaking was like in the 1950s.

And in an odd twist of fate, the film gives us far more information about the industry's cutthroat nature than it originally intended. For seeing 'A Star Is Born' today, in its reconstructed state, we learn first-hand how ruthless studio executives could be, and how they often cared more about a movie's bottom line than producing cinematic art. The cavalier manner in which Norman Maine is treated by Oliver Niles Productions in the film seems sympathetic when compared to how Warner Brothers treated 'A Star Is Born' shortly after its premiere. Originally clocking in at just over three hours, the film received rave reviews upon its release. Theatre owners, however, carped that the lengthy running time limited the number of showings per day, thus cutting into box office take. Worried the movie might not recoup its hefty investment; Warner recalled the film and hastily reedited it, lopping off two musical numbers and a critical stretch of plot that helped develop Norman and Esther's burgeoning relationship. Critics roundly condemned the new version, which many feel sabotaged the picture's Oscar chances.

The coveted cut footage was assumed to have been lost or destroyed, but in the early 1980s, film historian Ronald Haver scoured Warner's vaults, uncovering the complete 181-minute soundtrack, along with both deleted musical numbers (""Here's What I'm Here For"" and ""Lose That Long Face"") and a host of other snippets. He began to piece together a reconstructed version, inserting production stills over the portions of the soundtrack for which no corresponding film could be found. It was a novel approach, but effective, enabling the film at last to be seen as intended. The effect is a bit jarring at first, but the quality of the material trumps the awkwardness of the presentation. It's this version of 'A Star Is Born' that appears on this Blu-ray, and it's both a moving dramatic and musical experience, as well as a tribute to the cause of film preservation and restoration.

Of course, 'A Star Is Born' has always been a tribute to Judy Garland's brilliance. The fact she didn't win a Best Actress Oscar for her multi-faceted portrayal is one of Hollywood's great travesties. (Groucho Marx famously called it ""the biggest robbery since Brink's!"") Few performances brim with as much raw emotion, tenderness, and vitality as Garland's, and coupled with her virtuoso singing, which both thrills the senses and stirs the soul; it ranks as one of film history's finest tour de forces. James Mason, to his credit, knows when to relinquish the spotlight and when to shine on his own. His work is equally riveting, and nabbed him a well-deserved Best Actor nomination

The score by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin includes the famous torch song ""The Man That Got Away,"" which would instantly become a Garland standard, and though Cukor had never before directed a musical, he seems comfortable in the genre. The director's sense of rhythm and mood enhance the story and make the film seem much shorter than its three-hour running time.

Fascinating from many standpoints, as an unflinching portrait of a beloved medium; as a tribute to a director's vision; and as the ultimate showcase for one of the most spectacular talents ever to grace the screen. 'A Star Is Born' is riveting entertainment from start to finish. Aspects of its story may be a bit dated, but its performances remain timeless. Most of all, the film stands as a testament to the enduring brilliance of Judy Garland, who, as one critic so bluntly, and correctly, put it, gives ""just about the greatest one-woman show in modern film history."" After viewing 'A Star Is Born' for the first time or the hundredth, it's impossible not to agree.

Blu-ray Video Quality  'A Star Is Born' is a dark film, both thematically and visually, so it's especially gratifying to see such a gorgeous 1080p rendering that maximizes the film's colour palette without pushing it too far, and pumps up clarity and contrast to, at times, breath-taking degrees. Meticulously restored at high resolution, 'A Star Is Born' underwent a painstaking process to remove chemical staining and correct colour. The result is a superior transfer that nicely juggles the various film stocks and still sequences to produce as seamless a viewing experience as possible given the picture's unique circumstances and mixture of elements. Of course the brief carhop sequence looks grainy and a bit battered, but we're lucky it exists at all. On the whole, however, the image is clean, crisp, and sports a pleasing grain structure that lends the story vital warmth and texture. Contrast is solid and clarity is surprisingly good, especially when one factors in the primitive nature of CinemaScope at that time. Sure, there are some soft moments, but on the whole, the picture remains vivid and sharp. Close-ups look beautiful and you can see the perspiration glistening on Judy Garland's face during the ""Born in a Trunk"" number and flesh tones remain stable and true throughout, from Judy Garland's alabaster skin to James Mason's olive complexion. Fans have waited years for a high-definition upgrade of this classic film, and Warner delivers a beautiful product that will satisfy even the most critical eyes. Here's hoping more of the studio's catalogue musicals come our way...and soon.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  When it comes to classics, many of us tend to care more about picture quality than the sound quality, but in the case of 'A Star Is Born,' audio plays a vital role. And hearing 'A Star Is Born' in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is a thrilling experience. Without question, Judy Garland possessed one of the greatest singing voices in history, and here she is at her absolute peak. This superior track perfectly showcases her peerless instrument. Pure, controlled, and bursting with unbridled power, Judy Garland's vocals are crystal clear, with every warm tone, delicate nuance, and euphoric climax perfectly balanced to achieve maximum impact. The musical numbers possess a marvellous fullness, flooding the room with well-mixed, dynamic sound. Most of the audio is front-based, with some mild stereo separation widening the field somewhat. Surround activity is slight, but some crowd scenes possess a bit of wrap-around. Dialogue is always clear and comprehendible, and isolated accents, such as a trolley bell and the ignition of carbon arc klieg lights, are marvellously distinct. There's not much low-end action to involve the subwoofer, but bass tones during the songs supply some nice weight. Best of all, the track is clean, with no pops, crackles, or hiss mucking up the works. Faint bits of distortion occasionally crop up during Judy Garland's vocals, but you really have to listen closely to catch them. By far, this is the best 'A Star Is Born' has ever sounded, and fans of this classic film will be more than satisfied with this vibrant, immersive track.

In this 7-minute short, Daffy Guck must double for Bugs Bunny in any slapstick that Warner Bros. deems too dangerous for its top star.

Did I mention the film holds up quite well for a fifty-six-year old musical and it must be said that this has to be the finest version of one of the all-time great Hollywood tales, the 1954 'A Star Is Born' features one of the all-time great performances by one of the all-time great talents, Judy Garland. George Cukor's film combines a compelling dramatic story with an excellent score to create an emotionally powerful, thoroughly entertaining experience. Warner Home Video's Blu-ray presentation is top-notch, featuring a stunning 1080p transfer, dynamic audio, and hours of absorbing extras, and it is such an honour to add to my ever increasing Judy Garland Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

I loved it and never forgot how wonderful the music is and how touching the story is. Also James Mason and Judy Garland are two of my favorite people.

1236665,5,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland in character as Esther Blodgett utters the above line, but I believe that this was Judy Garland's own personal credo. This was to be the lady's comeback film after the termination of her MGM contract in 1950.  Although she had phenomenal success in concert format at the Palladium in London, and a record breaking run at the Palace Theatre on Broadway in 1951 through 1952, Garland and her new husband manager/promoter Sid Luft very much wanted to reestablish her as a viable movie star.  Accordingly, they signed a three picture deal with Warner Brothers Studios with Garland as the star and Luft as producer.  Garland hand-picked the initial project, a musical remake of the 1937 classic ""A Star Is Born"" starring Janet Gaynor and Frederic March.  She had unsuccessfully lobbied at MGM to be cast in a musical version after she had done a radio adaption with Walter Pidgeon in 1942.  Realizing that the film industry would be watching with an eagle eye as to whether she could still work the old magic or fall on her face, and that her future in films would depend on its reception, Garland & Luft surrounded her with top talent.  George Cukor who was a master director with women was enlisted, composer Harold Arlen who had written the music for two of Garland's most famous songs, ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""Get Happy"", and renowned lyricist Ira Gershwin would write a brand new score.  The strong screenplay was penned by Moss Hart, the Broadway playwright and Oscar nominee for his script for ""Gentlemen's Agreement"".  Last but not least James Mason was cast in the pivotal role of Norman Maine after Cary Grant turned it down with able support by Charles Bickford as studio head Oliver Niles, Jack Carson as publicity director Matt Libby, and Tommy Noonan as Esther's best friend pianist Danny McGuire.

Still, the production was a rocky one, with photography beginning in mid-October 1953 dragging on until late July 1954 for a variety of reasons ranging from scrapping several weeks of footage when the executive  order came down to restart in Cinemascope to an overwrought leading lady who often had emotional difficulties and substance abuse problems.  Yet the final results were worth it when the film opened to rave reviews with ecstatic love letters for Ms. Garland, and strong initial business.  However, theater exhibitors were complaining about the 182 minute running time, so a half hour was arbitrarily chopped out by Warner's so an extra daily showing could be squeezed in.  Regrettably, Cukor was in India shooting another film, so he had no say in the cuts, and the film was butchered, losing two major Garland numbers, ""Here's What I'm Here For"", and ""Lose That Long Face"".  Judy Garland and George Cukor were both furious and heartbroken by the abridged version and couldn't bear to watch it.

Film historian Ronald Haver had seen the uncut original when it opened, and made it his personal crusade to restore the film to its initial length.  His painstaking efforts paid off, he located the complete stereo recording of the soundtrack and most valuably color footage of the two deleted musical numbers mentioned above.  Where he was unable to find footage to match the dialogue he used stills from the film.  So this is the closest the viewers will come to the lost premier version.

The rudiments of the plot are quickly told.  Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland), a young struggling singer with the Glenn Williams Orchestra saves drunken movie star Norman Maine (James Mason) from making a fool of himself when he crashes her act at a sold out Hollywood benefit.  Maine finds he's attracted to Esther,later on, sobered up  he tracks her down to a little after hour's club.  Hearing her sing the torch song ""The Man That Got Away"", he's convinced she is a great singer with star quality and potential to be a film star.  He persuades Esther to leave the band for a screen test with his studio that he will arrange with the head of the studio, Oliver Niles (Charles Bickford).  After a temporary separation and setback, Esther and Norman are reunited, with Norman's help she is tested and signed, rechristened ""Vicki Lester"" and becomes a major musical film star.  Along the way, they both begin to fall in love, and get married.  However as Esther's star continues to rise, Norman's career is on a decline, hurt by his drinking which has made him unreliable, expensive and blunted his talent.  He's released from his contract by a reluctant Oliver, and Norman continues to spiral downward as his drinking accelerates playing havoc with their marriage.  A desperate Esther, still deeply in love with Norman is at wits end as to how to help him. That's all should be revealed, since I don't want to spoil the rest of the story.

Robert Osborne the host of the cable network ""Turner Classic Movies"" had said once when discussing the film that Judy Garland as brilliant as she is, was really a little too old to play the role.  There's an element of truth in that I suppose, although Ms. Garland was all of thirty one when she played Esther Blodgett.  Sadly, her personal problems and demons had aged her past her years, she looks at times more like she's in the mid to late thirties.  Her hair is dyed a very stark, harsh black, and usually is styled in an unbecoming fashion, her lips too bright a red against her pale complexion, quite often her costumes are unflattering.  Although at times Ms. Garland has a sleek theatrical attractiveness, the delicate beauty she had at the peak of the MGM years was gone.  The good news being that although she lost in looks, she gained in talent.  Her portrayal of Esther/Vicki is magnificent, a towering achievement worthy of every accolade and prize.  Ms. Garland was always an underrated, sensitive actress, but here her dramatic talents are burnished and polished to a dazzling incandescence.  Her scenes where she breaks down in her dressing room to the sympathetic Oliver and when she lashes out wildly at Danny towards the film's conclusion are both harrowing and heart wrenching.  This is a virtuoso performance full of warmth, humor, tenderness, passion, and pain.  She soars in her musical numbers most particularly in ""The Man That Got Away"", ""Someone at Last"", and ""Lose That Long Face"".  While she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, Ms. Garland would lose the Academy Award she so richly deserved to Grace Kelly, one of the most colossal Oscar injustices in its history.

James Mason as Norman Maine stands toe to toe with Ms. Garland in excellence.  He gives Norman Maine a tragic dignity that retains the audience's sympathy even when he drunkenly mortifies Esther at her moment of glory accidently back slapping her face as she clutches the Best Actress Oscar she has just won.  Through it all, even as he sinks lower into his alcohol fueled despair, we are never in doubt of his true love for Esther and his pride in her remarkable talent.  And so because of this, we come to care and empathize with this tormented, self-destructive man.  Like his co-star he would win a Golden Globe but not the Oscar.

The score by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin is unqualifiedly marvelous, wondrous songs that each is integral to the plot, all sublimely rendered by Judy Garland.  The jewel in the crown is ""The Man That Got Away"", the special song that is to showcase Esther's extraordinary vocal talent to Norman.  It fulfills that objective and then some; it remains the penultimate torch song.  Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Song, incredibly it lost to one of the most blah, banal tunes ever written ""Three Coins in a Fountain"" UGGGHHH!

I will probably be crucified by the die-hard Judy Garland fans, but the one musical number I wasn't fond of is the interminable ""Born in a Trunk"".  It's a compilation of standards stitched together by special material by Garland's musical mentor at MGM, Roger Edens and Leonard Gershe.  It's supposedly the sequence in Esther's first film to show off her remarkable star quality.  It's redundant we've already seen and heard the proof with ""The Man That Got Away"", and it's over fifteen minutes long, it would have just been better to have her sing the best number in it, ""Swanee"", and cut the rest.

The best of the extras starts with the three different versions filmed of ""The Man That Got Away"". There is television coverage of the gala Hollywood premiere with the crme de la crme of Hollywood circa 1954,  Elizabeth Taylor and then husband Michael Wilding, Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Dean Martin, Joan Crawford et al, including the stars Judy Garland and Jack Carson.  Then there is the Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck cartoon called ""A Star Is Bored.""  Finally in the Audio Vault there is the radio version with Garland/Pidgeon from 1942 that started the whole thing, you can get to compare the two Garland performances.

Of the three versions of ""A Star Is Born"", this is the one that is definitive and a don't miss.  The original from 1937 starring Gaynor and  March comes in a worthy second best.  As for the 1976 Streisand version, Barbra get lost!",1399334400,,9116,4.800768737988469

I don't think I'm alone in saying that it's more than a little frustrating that the 1983 ""restored version"" has been the ONLY version available for a long, long time.  While I'm certainly grateful for the late Ronald Haver's efforts to restore the film to its premiere length (and his 1988 book about the project is still one of my favorites of its kind) I've found that this version just doesn't play very well with viewers who aren't serious Garland fans and/or die-hard old-movie buffs.  It's probably a lost cause--given the current attitude that movies should be the product of a single auteur and not of a Hollywood studio factory--but I'm seriously hoping that Warner Home Video (or its made-to-order subsidiary, Warner Archive) will one day see fit to let us revisit the general-release (154-minute) version of this movie--which has not seen the light of day in over three decades. The novelty value of the restoration, with its distracting (at least to some of us) use of still photos, has long since worn off, and those of us who'd just like to see the movie as it was seen by most audiences upon its original release--as opposed to a patchwork reconstruction of an arguably overlong premiere version that was seen by relatively few people--have been repeatedly denied that option with the release of two VHS editions, two laserdisc editions, two DVD editions, and finally the Blu-ray edition.

1236703,5,B00000JQU8,"A Star is Born (1954) is Judy Garland's greatest performance as an actress/singer. At three hours in length, it surprisingly goes fast, as it's filled with great singing, dancing, and incredible screen presence from Garland. It's a film that shows a singer/actress going from obscurity to superstardom, while the man promoting her has his own star fall, giving it irony. Garland's performance is witty, heartfelt, and energetic. In fact, I consider her performance the greatest in movie history. This film is not without its problems, though. It's hard to believe that pieces of this film were missing (and some still are), thus creating a fill-in with still shots in some parts of the film. While initially distracting, it eventually becomes tolerable, and strangely unique and refreshing. To think that a masterpiece of a film such as this could've been even better frightens me! The picture and sound quality aren't top-notch, yet not bad either. This film is almost 60 years old, and it's pretty impressive visually for being that old. The bonus disc is a must-see four hour marathon that will embellish ones appreciation of this huge project. There are goodies galore, so don't miss this second disc.

However, now that it is on DVD, you can skip that number entirely & watch a truly classic love story, which was the intent of the original project in the thirties.  Had MGM only had the vision needed for a talent such as hers & made the re-make 5-7 years earlier while they had her under contract at their studio, she would have been the perfect age for the role (She actually did a radio performance of the nonmusical role in the forties & fell in love with the story!).

Besides all of the above, it is still a great film & one for which Ms. Garland readily deserved that year's Oscar, not Grace Kelly!!!!  However, Hollywood can have a long & unforgiving memory, sometimes.  You notice Ms. Garland has yet to be awarded even a posthumous Oscar for lifetime achievement & when you can say ""Judy"" 44-plus years after her death & her CD's & films still sell & books & documentaries are still being written & developed, you had better damn well believe she deserves that Oscar.

1236731,4,B00000JQU8,"I never really ""got"" Judy Garland until I saw the 1954 version of ""A Star is Born"" as restored in 1983 by Ronald Haver. You'd have to be a rock to come away from this film less than in awe of her talent. I can play her performance of the song ""The Man That Got Away"" 20 times in a row without getting tired of it. Director George Cukor handles her brilliantly, letting her humor, intelligence and all-a-tremble emotionalism serve the tragic story of the talented Esther Blodgett and her doomed husband Norman Maine in all the right places.

The underrated James Mason balances Garland beautifully with his haunting, subtle, oddly dignified portrayal of the alcoholic Norman, an on-the-skids matinee idol who sees Esther's potential and pushes her toward stardom. His casting was something of a fortunate miracle, because the studio wanted a lot of other people to play Norman, including Cary Grant, and Mason only got the part after several other actors refused or were unavailable. Mason is versatile enough that we can believe in the different facets of his complex character. The supporting performances by Charles Bickford as studio head Oliver Niles, Jack Carson as studio publicist Matt Libby, and Tom Noonan as Esther's friend Danny McGuire, are excellent.

Cukor's approach to Moss Hart's articulate, bitterly ironic script shows an amazing sensitivity to the characters and the material, which contrasts the bright shining artifice of Hollywood's finished product with what it does behind the scenes to churn out that product.

Unfortunately Warner Brothers' butchered ""A Star is Born"" after its universally acclaimed premiere to reduce the running time so theaters could squeeze in more shows per day and sell more tickets. I never saw that cut of the movie but have heard it made little sense and ruined its chances. The 1983 version restores the development of Norman and Esther's characters and relationship. This helps the story work better, but many scenes are limited to pans over sepia-toned still photographs and recovered soundtrack material. It's better than nothing but it's jarring and frustrating.

The other problem, and I fear Garland's  most devoted fans will slam this, is that the film has too much of a good thing in that there's too much Judy. Her performances are fine, but the songs are not strong enough to justify it. The ""Born in a Trunk"" sequence shows her off as it was designed to do (it was added to the film after Cukor had left Los Angeles thinking the movie was done), but feels overlong and forced into the narrative, as does the bombastic ""Someone at Last.""  The two great songs, ""Gotta Have Me Go with You"" and ""The Man That Got Away"" are used up early in the movie. Aside from the thematically crucial ""Get Your Long Face Off,"" the remaining songs are not sufficiently memorable for the time they take up.

Not everyone will like everything about this well-made but imperfect movie, but it's essential viewing as a record of one of the greatest talents of the 20th century.

I have the 1999 2-sided DVD. The picture is often grainy and the sound quality is inconsistent. I don't know to what extent that's the fault of the source material and to what extent its the quality of the product. The DVD extras are limited to multiple alternate versions of ""The Man That Got Away"" with Judy in different costumes, and newsreel footage of the premiere of ""A Star is Born"" which feels remarkably like the opening scene of ""A Star is Born"" in which fictitious celebrities arrive for a benefit at the Shrine Auditorium.

I suggest fans of this version of ""A Star is Born"" check out, if you can find it, an art-house obscurity starring Robert Downey, Jr. called ""Two Girls and A Guy"" (not suitable for viewing by children).  If you only know Downey from his Brat Pack movies and the Iron Man franchise, you are in for a huge surprise.",1374192000,,3869,4.813253012048193

Both my wife and I had been Garland fans long before ""A Star Is Born"" was made. We knew by the grapevine that the picture was about to be previewed and like many others, eagerly awaited it. I got a call from my friend in the afternoon saying that it was to be ""sneaked"" at the Encino that evening. We immediately headed  for the theatre to be sure and get tickets. When the show started and the opening titles came on, the audience went wild. Judy and Sid Luft were sitting in the back of the theatre. In those days, fans would applaud the ending of musical numbers just as they would at a ""live presentation."" This happened many times throughout the showing. We saw the complete film as it was originally edited, before Jack Warner made the length conform to it being shown as a double feature with some ""B"" picture. (No soul)
When the show ended, we hurried out to the portcochere area at the side of the theatre and waited for the star to come out. She was in a pink suit with a tiny pill box hat to match. She smiled and waved to the crowd before getting into the limo. We were so close, we could have reached out and touched her. That was an evening to remember.

1236753,3,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland was an incredibly talented singer, dancer, and actress. For me, her two movie masterpieces are ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" because both films include songs that showcase her incredible voice, as well as being great stories.

In contrast, I found ""A Star Is Born"" to be somewhat disappointing, and it was also frustrating. The cast is excellent, with Garland providing a memorable performance that should have won her the Academy Award. James Mason manages to make Norman Maine believable and even sympathetic, which must have been a real challenge, since the character is so self-destructive. Jack Carson and Tommy Noonan also do a great job.

The problem I had with the film is that it felt patched together. During the preview of Judy's first film as Vicki Lester, there's a very long medley (""Born in a Trunk"") in which she reminisces about how long it took her to hit the big time. Apparently, this entire sequence was added after the primary filming, and while it showcases Judy's singing and dancing, it also brings the story to a grinding halt.

I also found the use of black and white still photo sequences (mostly near the beginning of the film) to be disruptive and out of character with the rest of the movie. I thought that it was an artistic decision by the director, but in reading about the film, discovered that these sequences were restored to replace large sections that had been cut out of the original film in an effort to shorten its run time. Apparently, the original color footage was lost or destroyed, so they had to piece it together with the stills, and used the soundtrack for the dialogue.

There are also some sequences near the opening which look like badly colorized newsreel footage of a Hollywood opening.

Another musical number that I felt slowed down the movie was when Judy sings and dances for James Mason after she's returned from a rehearsal. The song itself is forgettable, and it actually interferes with the story.

My biggest problem with the film is that it's just way too long. They could have kept most of Judy's songs and still cut the film's time by at least 30 or 40 minutes, without losing anything important. This is a film about show business as much as it is about anything, and it was probably hard for the people who made the movie to cut anything about their highly specialized world.

Still, I can see why the film has so much appeal to so many people, especially Garland fans. Her rendition of ""The Man Who Got Away"" is amazing, showing her at her most natural. And the very final scene, in which she introduces herself as ""Mrs. Norman Maine,"" is the perfect ending. However, whether or not the finale is worth 3 hours is open to question.

As for the Blu-Ray, the image quality varies from excellent to quite poor (the opening sequence that I mentioned above is downright fuzzy, for example), The audio is good. Dialogue is clear throughout, and musical numbers have a decent dynamic range.

I'd give the film 5 stars for Garland, Mason, and Carson, all of whom do an outstanding job in their respective roles, 4 stars for a good story, but 2 stars for being too long, badly edited, and not flowing as naturally as it could.",1364860800,,3217,4.649647887323944
1236754,5,B00000JQU8,"I just finished the wonderful biography, ""Get Happy,"" by Gerald Clarke.  I knew Judy Garland's life was bad, but I had no idea how bad.  I didn't know that, even early in her career (and throughout), she was constantly missing strings of shooting days, calling in sick, and having breakdowns.  Her identity seemed to be solely wrapped up in her performing, and she only felt loved and needed when she was being adored, and taken care of by the various men (who often misused her).

""A Star Is Born"" was the first movie that her third husband, Sid Luft, produced.  It was amazing.  The great Cukor was on board, as well as Ira Gershwin and Harold Arlen.  As others have said, the premiere was a smashing success.  Things were looking up.  Then the studio head thought it was way too long and shaved something like 45 minutes off, which made the film confusing.  It became a flop on its release and lost the Lufts (Judy and Sid) a great deal of money.

This is the restored version (as much as possible).  When you see the PHOTOGRAPHS in this movie, those were the scenes that were scrapped to recycle the materials from the film.  CAN YOU IMAGINE?

What you see here is, in fact, a masterpiece.  The irony is that it is a biography of her own life, but ""Judy Garland"" is actually her husband's character, Norman Maine, played by James Mason.

At the end of the movie, I felt such gratitude, not because I was grateful that I have not lived such a tragic life, but that this movie put me in the presence of true greatness.  If you can listen to the climax of ""Swanee"" and not be thrilled, you have no soul.  If you can watch her tousle her her hair during ""The Man that Got Away"" and not swoon, you need to have your heart examined.

Judy, I believe, was the most talented popular entertainer who ever lived.  This movie proves it.",1364083200,,1829,4.402985074626866

1236789,4,B00000JQU8,"his movie has been made three times--in 1937, 1954, and 1976--and this one, which is the middle, is generally held to be the best.  Soon after the end of World War II, at a Hollywood benefit show, film star Norman Maine (James Mason) meets Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland), a singer with a big band booked for a number.  Maine is pretty drunk, but he's been around a long time, and he knows real talent when he sees it.  He tracks Esther down and learns something of her past; she's worked for years to get where she is, though it means a life on the road in motels and the band's bus, and her dreams don't extend much farther than the hope that someday there will be a recording executive in the audience, he'll sign her up, and her record will be a hit.  Maine encourages her to dream bigger (why not the movies?), gets her signed to a contract at his studio, buoys her confidence (one of the best scenes occurs after Esther has been convinced by Makeup that her ""nose is too big"" and her ""ears are all wrong;"" Garland definitely wasn't conventionally beautiful, but Maine helps her see her own good points and how to make the best use of them), helps her adjust to the slightly unreal life behind studio gates (which includes having her name changed, without any input from her, to Vicki Lester), and eventually maneuvers his producer, Oliver Niles (Charles Bickford), into hearing a tape of her singing.  (Her extended ""Born in a Trunk"" number, near the end of the first part, is probably a pretty close summation of Esther's life to that point.)  After that her career is off and running.

Of course, by this time, she's fallen in love with Maine.  And Maine knows, in his sober moments, what he is.  But he also finds something in her that rejuvenates him, and they marry.  Even Niles says this may be the only thing that can save him.  For a while it's good; she makes him laugh, and their house is  full of her singing.  But her career is on the upswing and his is tanking.  The studio buys out his contract.  Being ""Mr. Vicki Lester"" and taking her phone messages is more than his pride can take.  When she wins the Best Actress Oscar, he interrupts her acceptance with a desperate, drunken plea for a job.  What's tragic is that he knows how far down he's gone; he tries to straighten out, even undergoes a cure at a sanatorium.  It doesn't work; before long he's wrecking cars and resisting arrest.  Despite the strain on their marriage, Esther stands loyally by him.  Her career is the last thing he has to be proud of--the last thing that remains of what he once was.  In the end, he knows what he has to do.

This deluxe two-disc edition features the 1983 reconstruction, done partly with studio stills and snippets of soundtrack, which extends its running time to nearly three hours; you may want to view it over two sittings (there's an Intermission at the end of the first act).  If you've never heard Garland sing--and even if you have--her rendition of ""The Man That Got Away"" will give you cold chills.  Her acting ranges from girlish playfulness to grief and despair to steely resolve to hysteria.  This isn't a ""musical comedy,"" but a ""drama with songs.""  It's also a fascinating look backstage at the film industry toward the end of the studio era.  A bonus disc provides assorted background material.",1353283200,,3322,4.530201342281879

1236794,4,B00000JQU8,"Norman Maine (James Mason) is an actor on his way down due to alcoholism. Esther Blodgett is a singer with a voice, well a voice like Judy Garland. Maine is so impressed with her he gets her a screen test and, predictably, she is a big hit. She not only loves him, she is enormously grateful to him, so she marries him.

But his attempts to dry out don't work for long. The publicity guy from the studio, who has always hated him, makes some extremely rude comments to him at a bar where he has been drinking ginger ale, and they have a fight. When the fight is over, he orders a double scotch.

So later when their agent (or the studio guy; I never got clear on what roles the other people played; they were part of the behind-the-camera business) comes to visit and she says he is asleep, she and the studio guy are out on the patio and she tells him she's going to give up her career to take care of her husband. Turns out he's awake and hears them. So he drowns himself rather than have her give up her career.

This is a three hour movie, and I loved all of it except the last ten minutes or so. I have a particular bias about this film, and so I have to explain my bias. In the end, Norman Maine (James Mason) commits suicide in order to free his wife Vicki Lester (Judy Garland) from the burden he has become to her. She loves him and does not consider him a burden, but he does it anyway. Whether or not it is a worthwhile sacrifice is for others to judge.

1236795,5,B00000JQU8,"that this was Judy Garland's finest hour in films.  My five star rating comes from seeing this film in a Boston theatre in the mid 1980's.  1984, I think.  It was a stunning event. You simply had, and have, to see it on the big screen.

So now I have this disc thing.  It IS her finest hour.  Or hours.  It's all here. It's a long film, but it was intended to be so.  This was no run of the musical.  This was and is the real deal. The GWTW of movie musicals.

Prissy Noel Coward (though I'm fond of his writings) loved the film but not the ""Born In A Trunk"" sequence.  I don't agree with him.  He's wrong.  My gripe is the ""It's A New World"" number sung in a cheap motel room.  Garland should have been given a better number, I think.  But who cares what I think.  I wasn't there and had no input on the production.  I wasn't even born then.

I saw this film, years earlier, in my parents' basement on a black and white Zenith TV.  The dressing room sequence had been cut out, as well as ""Lose That Long Face"".  I wondered why she was there with spots on her face for 5 seconds and then disappeared.  Now I know.  Her dressing room breakdown scene raises the hair on my neck and goosebumps all over me.  Her character is so naked and Judy is so sublime.  Thrilling.  Brilliant acting.

Her voice is dark and needy and wonderful.  Gone forever is the MGM songbird.  Here, forever, is the adult Garland in a role that gives her everything, and she takes everything and throws it back at you.  This really isn't acting.  It's acting at it's most sublime level.  She threw herself into it and she would never have a role like this again.  She knew that.

James Mason is perfectly adequate as her costar.  But it's Judy's show, all the way.  And she'll never let us forget it.",1335916800,,1772,4.188059701492537

Remade as a musical(1954), it out shines the original(1937)in more ways than acting.  The sets and outdoor scenes, the ""color"" of Technicolor, the music, especially, the direction of Cukor, and most of all the performances of Garland and Mason are superb. Garland is way over the top as Vickie Lester and James Mason matches her performance, in all the right ways - word for word, expression for expression, as Norman Maine! Although almost 3 hours long, I wished it had been longer, but the restoration by Ronald Haver was truly a job well done! His restoration never took away from the story.

1236810,5,B00000JQU8,"In general, an unvarnished opinion of the stresses and criticism of Hollywood studios who seem more interested in the ""next big thing"" than the person who is acclaimed the star.  And, the ""star"" who looks like he or she is enjoying the limelight is in fact suffering both personally and at times in fear of an overenthusiastic audience.

Yep, that's what I got from this excellent version of ""A Star is Born"" starring Judy Garland who was herself having personal problems very similar to James Mason's character, Norman Maine.

We meet Norman at an event where Vicky/Esther (Garland) is performing.  Norman is drunk and at times violent, throwing one guy through a mirror.  But he's a big star and apparently feels he is without fear or remorse for his actions!  (Wow, some things in Hollywood have not changed, eh, Charlie, Mel and Lindsey?)

But this is a musical and we have some great tunes by Ira Gershwin and others.  Amazing energy and enthusiasm in both music and direction.  And the undercurrent of greed, corruption, and extreme anguish is always there, just waiting to jump out to the viewer.

The film plays on the full gamut of emotions and that's what I loved best about it.  When Esther exclaims, ""Why does he want to destroy himself so?"" and sobs and sobs before going back on stage singing about ""turning that smile into a frown.""  The irony of that was powerful.

Norman continues slipping and failing in his career and his only real bright spot was discovering Esther Blogett!  It takes most of the film for her to realize it as well and when she does the movie ends.  Tragic, uplifting, and surprisingly romantic!

The history of the film itself is very interesting as well; how the studio chopped it up for audiences and how it took many years to finally put most of it back together again.  In my Special Edition DVD, there are stills and prerecorded dialogue that are used to paste the missing scenes together which is really fun to watch!

Highly recommended!  Grace Kelly took the Oscar away from Judy that year and in the words of Groucho Marx: ""Biggest robbery since Brinks!""

1236811,5,B00000JQU8,"I must say I find it a very frustrating experience when I read reviews whereby (some) Amazon customers decry this DVD as a rip off (which it isn't) declaring it is the same as an earlier DVD release of the same movie,(and which again, not so).
I have owned several different versions of A Star Is Born from VHS to several DVD's, and this is by far the best quality picture of the lot. If you don't have an HD TV (or Blu Ray) then I imagine it would be well nigh impossible to comment accurately on what is before you. You can't see the film as was intended.
The versions of The Man That Got Away that are shown as extras on this latest version, maybe of no interest or even boring to some, but to those of us who love to hear about the professionalism of specially gifted performers such as Miss Garland, it has a fascinating background.

I once saw an interview with Vincente Minnelli where he was talking about the great artists he had directed over a 30 - 40 year career. The one who stood above the rest was Judy Garland. She was, he said,someone who needed no direction, she instinctively knew what was required in each scene. He would - prior to the first take - give her a list of directives, camera placements etc,and she would remember them all, without ever having to be reminded of anything.
Her last song to be filmed at MGM before her departure, was the unforgettable ""Get Happy"" - done in one take.
They did many takes of ""The Man That Got Away,"" for A Star Is Born, because they were trying to get the best effect possible by deciding which outfit was the one to go with. They wanted the right blending of colour to ensure the scene looked its best.
Each time the song was filmed, Judy completed it in one take. And so measured were her performances, that they were able to show us by running several takes on screen concurrently,how effortlessly she was able to achieve a high standard,take after take - something they said was extremely rare, if not unheard of - with other singers of that era.

And this is the essence of A Star Is Born - it is after all these years a tribute to one of the finest entertainers of all time - the great, the unforgettable Judy Garland. If ever there was a reason to award a special Oscar posthumously - this is definately the one.
Get this DVD if you don't already have it. Garland we have spoken of, but James Mason as Norman, Esther Blodgett's (Garland's) alcoholic husband whose career is on a downward spiral is a wonderful performance.",1304121600,,2490,4.375809935205184

The special features sort of makes you feel like you're taking a journey back in time, as if you were actually there while this film was being made.

Surely someone from all the previous Reviewers who are longtime fans of this Classic must have noted whether the correct 2.55:1 has in fact been utilised as would be naturally expected.

After the previous nice DVD copy with extras,  why buy the BluRay unless the fact of the originial CINEMASCOPE ratio is confirmed initially.

The film was originally produced using the full sweep of the wide screen and any ""modern morphing"" so the image will fill

OCTOBER 1st, 2012  - UPDATE -

Have just re-read (fourth time since 1988) Ronald Haver's wonderful book on the making and the restoration of the 1954 version of A STAR IS BORN and just watched the brilliant BluRay DVD of the restored film once again. (Presented in it's original screen format).

Anyone who has yet to view this film for the first time should delay no longer in ordering the BluRay - the film was truly incredibly well photographed - being only the third CinemaScope film produced.

An emotionally dramatic experience with a brilliant soundtrack and great performances overall.

To this day, regarding the two lead performances, it still begs the question: ""Why did the two stars miss out on the awards?"" Perhaps because the film was cut prior to the awards season and the truncated version confused the voters. That cinema managers complaining they would take more income from extra screenings via a shortened version, causing Jack Warner to conceded was regrettable. In retrospect, the excellent opening reviews and initial positive box-office receipts could have continued had they not panicked.

The extended CD from 2004 of the film soundtrack, with the previously unavailable deleted songs from the original released film version, as well as all the alternate takes and background score, is certainly a valuable supplementary item worth obtaining.

1236814,5,B00000JQU8,"It is incessantly difficult for me to put into words how this film moves me. But here's trying:

Judy Garland's rendition of ""The Man Who Got Away"" bring me to tears each time I hear it. Although Judy has sung many songs that make a movie, I believe none are as filled with passion and expression like this one. When she sings, you can hear the heartbreak in her voice. It sends shivers down my spine, and breaks my heart just a little bit more with each note. Many others have sung the song well, but none as truly great as Judy.

Judy delivers her most intense performance as Esther Blodgett. While she is working her way up into superstardom, she falls in love with Norman Maine, a Hollywood mogul and destructive alcoholic. Without giving away too much of the plot, Norman finds it difficult to deal with Esther's fame and his alcoholism runs rampant. Esther tries her best to be there for her husband and truly believes that she can help and save him (typical good-girl drawn to bad-boy syndrome).

This is a real look at how Hollywood affects people's lives. Hollywood rarely has any successful, faithful couples, and many people tend to lose their soul in ""The Business."" Ironically, Garland met a similar fate as Norman Maine due to addiction and pressures. I'm sure when filming this movie, Garland had no idea how close to real life it would be for her. This movie is a very real look at what The Machine can do to people searching for fame, trying to keep fame, and attempting to re-gain fame.",1292457600,,1504,4.5424354243542435
1236815,5,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland was a star, a personna and a born entertainer.  She provided so much magic with her movies and music but for her films the two that mark the best of Judy are THE WIZARD OF OZ and A STAR IS BORN.  The first is already on blu ray in a magical presentation and now we have an amazing hardback digibook with amazing liner notes on the film and special features galore for A STAR IS BORN.  But of course the main course here is the film.  Blu ray is amazing and when an old film is enhanced the first question is always did it succeed and is it an upgrade from earlier releases of the film.  Here the answer is a resoundung yes.  The restoration brings a vibrancy and vitality new to the film.  Colors and skin tones are enhanced beautifully and realistically.  What they did here so pefectly was use the new technology to enhance the film without taking away its film qualities that made it such a classic.  There is some graininess at times but if it had been removed the integrity of the film would have been removed.  Here, enhanced by blu ray, the film takes on new life and for me it was as if viewing it for the first time.  Close ups are spectacular and the enhanced audio provides musical numbers that become magic and dialogue looses nothing in the translation.  THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY is reborn in itself.  Try to keep a dry eye or your heart from skipping a beat when hearing and seeing it.

Of course with blu ray and its enhancement comes a stronger clarity into the essence of a film.  When cast in A STAR IS BORN which was in many ways a comeback for Judy after some troubled years many thought she was too old to play the part.  Here, with the enhancements, you can see that she was older and also see the makeup trying to cover away the years.  The story is supposed to be about a young struggling singer who gets discovered.  Judy's performance is so great and all encompassing that the story changes to that of a struggling singer who is discovered.  The age is not important and is actually never mentioned in the film.  For me the character is ageless and her matching with James Mason is perfection.  Was Judy robbed of the Oscar for this film?  I cannot say for I am only 49 and was not around at the time.  I didn't see all the other films and actresses she was up against.  But whether she won or not does not in any way take away from the magic that A STAR IS BORN provides.  The story is actually a dark one and deals with some strong issues for the time.  Movies, singing and entertainment are a backdrop for a deeply troubled love and marriage.  The emotional wallop delivered here is amazing and not lost by time.  This is truly one of the best films ever made and blu ray enhances it 100% over any previous release.  Magically cast, perfectly directed and provided here at its intended length, this is a must have.  A classic film and a true entertainment legend come together to make history.  Highly recommended.",1287705600,,2953,4.324225865209471

I deeply appreciate that miracle that we even have this movie as we see it today thanks to the amazing, labor of love restoration effort.

Even the look of the film is a wonder to behold. The masterful use of color makes you feel like contemporary movies, even with their big budget pyrotechnics and computer generated effects, are only harnessing a fraction of the visible color spectrum compared to the dazzling visuals of A Star is Born.

The supplemental disc is a treasure unto itself. I don't think you could come any closer to knowing how exciting an event A Star is Born was in its day without having been actually been there.

The Blu-Ray by Warner Bros/MGM is Codefree, but contains not a german soundtrack.

The Bonus-materials are very interesting.

Trivia:

The film was re-edited several times. Premiering at 181 minutes, the studio (Warner Bros.) cut the film by 30 minutes despite the objections of director George Cukor and producer Sidney Luft (Judy Garland's husband). In 1983, all but 5 minutes of the cut footage was found and re-instated, but some footage had to be reconstructed using production stills.

Average Shot Length (ASL) = 16 seconds

Humphrey Bogart (one of the possible candidates for the role of Norman Maine) can be heard as the voice of the drunk requesting ""Melancholy Baby"" in the caf

Early tests were made using WarnerScope (Warner's own wide screen format) and WarnerColor. Both were judged to be unsatisfactory. The film was shot in CinemaScope (licensed from Fox) and Technicolor.

In the scene after the movie premiere, Matt Libby is at a party where he passes a man and says, ""Hey, Ray! Great score, the best!"" The man is Ray Heindorf, musical director for this film.

1236842,5,B00000JQU8,"It's the story of a rising Hollywood star and a fading one. It's the story of a real-world woman battling with her daemons. It's a peek inside the magic and politics of 1950's Hollywood. It's told with supreme craft and excellence. It's a classic that can't be missed. And you've never seen it as dazzling, colorful and crisp as on this Blu-ray release.

A Star Is Born can't be missed by anyone interested in the heights that film can achieve.  As an added bonus to this Blu-ray release, the second disc is chock full of vintage audio and video from the film's initial release.  Comparisons of alternate takes, a 30 minute premiere special, speeches, interviews, all from 1954.  Watching it all is like being transported back in time. It's a fabulous time capsule.  My only quibble is that there is no historical commentary placing the film in context and exploring it's many layers. The 40 page book touches on some of these aspects, but I wish more time would have been devoted to them on the disc itself.

Garland does her best singing and acting on film and James Mason must have been her mentor. The sound quality of the musical numbers from the dingy nightclub trio of the ""Man That Got Away""to the big production number ""Born in A Trunk"" are a joy to be heard. The accompanying book with the disc is a terrific momento to the making of ""A Star Is Born"" and Miss Garland's career.  A special features DVD on the making of this movie is also included to complete this collector's treasure.",1279929600,,719,4.558139534883721
1236845,5,B00000JQU8,"""(That was) the greatest robbery since Brinks"" said Groucho Marx upon Judy Garland's losing the Oscar for ""A Star Is Born"" to Grace Kelly. Politics always exists; and this time it exerted a cruel influence. Judy Garland deserved the Oscar for Best Actress in this film.

Of course, everyone pretty much knows the plot by now; either they've heard of it before they got to this web page or they read reviews by other Amazon reviewers. Judy Garland plays Esther Blodgett, a band singer whose career soars into superstardom when she meets and falls in love with Hollywood mogul Norman Maine, played brilliantly by James Mason. There are some ups and downs along the way, however. (In case you don't know the whole plot, I won't spoil it for you here!)

The love affair between Esther and Norman is well played out: indeed, the acting of all the performers is entirely convincing and made me wish for more high quality films to be put out today!

The plot bravely tackles the problems of the Hollywood life: careers going up and down, lives sometimes completely destroyed in the process. The ""performances within a performance"" are especially outstanding: we see Esther showcase and spoof the 1950s type musical in the scene where she shows Norman the ""big"" musical number (""Somewhere There's) A Someone At Last"" at the studio; and the ""Born in a Trunk"" sequence is one of the most artistic and spellbinding experiences anyone could ever hope to achieve in any motion picture.

Yet even with its plot, the film is primarily a vehicle to showcase Judy's talents. She doesn't fail to disappoint! My eyes were glued to her the entire time she was on screen; her acting, singing and dancing were beyond remarkable. She belts out classic Garland numbers such as ""Swanee,"" ""Born in a Trunk,"" and ""The Man That Got Away."" This last song is arguably one of the best Garland signature songs ever along with ""Over the Rainbow"" from a film a few of you may have heard of!

In addition, Garland fans may note that Judy's real life personality is perhaps best described as a blend of Norman's behavior and Esther's incredible talent and resiliency. Equally important, the plot is based at least in part on the marriage of Frank Fay and Barbara Stanwyck.

While I agree with the reviewer who writes that there's only so much improvement you can make with the image quality because of the type of film they used when shooting this movie, nevertheless, the enhancement of the image quality that I did notice impressed me. The sound was quite good, too. Sadly, this movie remains cut by roughly three minutes; it never should have been whittled down just for the sake of the almighty dollar. No wonder Judy and director George Cukor were so infuriated they vowed never to watch the film again!

The DVD comes with wonderful extras on a second DVD disc. There are so many bonus features that I hardly know where to start! There are 5 additional takes for ""The Man That Got Away;"" alternate takes for ""Here's What I'm Here For;"" ""Trinidad Cocoanut Oil Shampoo;"" ""When My Sugar Walks Down the Street;"" and more including a vintage featurette with Jack Warner; a wonderful vintage featurette of The Pantages Premiere TV Special and quite a few audio tracks from the ""audio vault."" There's still more for you to discover including the 1942 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of ""A Star Is Born"" with Judy as Esther Blodgett and Walter Pidgeon as Norman Maine; and that's grand.

My only minor disappointment was that the movie, which could have been presented on a single side of a DVD disc, is instead presented to us on two sides of one disc and it disturbs the flow somewhat to have to flip the disc even if there was an intermission at one point when they showed this film in theaters.

In short, if you love musicals, Judy Garland, James Mason, or just plain top notch quality film in general, you simply can't miss this edition of A Star is Born on DVD!

1236846,4,B00000JQU8,"After its 1954 premier, the film was shortened for its wider release.  In 1983, it was restored to near its original running time.  It remains one of more iconic stories of Hollywood with all its heartache and fame intact.  The film itself is ""one of Hollywood's supreme triumphs"" and the new transfer is breathtaking on Blu-ray.

Judy Garland is a band-singer guided to the pinnacle of success by a former star (James Mason) who is an alcoholic. George Cukor's stylish direction is strangely exhilarating even as the story moves to its inexorable and tragic end",1278979200,,562,4.88421052631579
1236847,4,B00000JQU8,"I recently read a great article that talks about this film.  Four complete prints do exist, but the collectors are not willing to let WB have them because they don't want to compensate the collectors, claiming it is their product.  So, until these disputes are settled we are left with this version, still glorious, but still a mere shadow of the complete original.",1278979200,,365,4.777777777777778
1236848,4,B00000JQU8,"If you're here, you likely know the film's plot, as well as the making, butchering, and reconstruction of the film, so I'll not go into all that. I'm strictly going to comment on the contents of this new package.

First, let me sing the praises of this new set. Most importantly, the film has been given a beautiful restoration. While video issues from the film's previous DVD release haven't been completely eradicated, they have been improved greatly. The colors are beautiful and vibrant, especially during ""Born In A Trunk."" Sharpness is improved, albeit not completely perfect due to the single-strip Technicolor film stock, which just can't be sharpened as much as some other film stocks can. The film definitely won't be confused for a brand new film anytime soon, but it definitely doesn't look as though it's pushing 60.

In addition, all bonus material, except for a few text screens of bios and such, from the film's previous DVD release have been transferred to this new set, meaning we get the deleted ""When My Sugar Walks Down The Street,"" originally included in ""Born In A Trunk,"" as well as the entire network broadcast of the film's premiere at the Pantages Theater, plus newsreel coverage, multiple takes of ""The Man That Got Away,"" audio from deleted scenes that weren't reinserted into the 1983 restoration, a short Warner Bros. promotional film that features some alternate takes from the film, and theatrical trailers for all three versions. In addition, we also now have even MORE takes of ""The Man That Got Away,"" alternate versions of three musical scenes and one dramatic scene, a cartoon really only similar in title, (""A Star Is Bored""), recording sessions, radio interviews, color Cinemascope footage of the premiere, and the 1942 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the original film with Judy as Esther Blodgett and Walter Pidgeon as Norman Maine. Evertything included here is a welcome addition and when some studios notoriously reissue their DVD's and take away decent bonus materials and replace them with mediocre crud, it's nice that Warner has kept everything and added onto it.

However, this new DVD edition of Star is far from perfect. In fact, it's downright disappointing in many aspects. First of all, the previous DVD was a flipper disc, with the film on one side and bonus materials on the other. This time, the film is split between two sides of a flipper disc. Although both sides are dual-layer, side 1 doesn't even take up the full 4.35 GB that a DVD-5 uses, and side 2 just barely goes over the 4.35 GB limit. No reason it couldn't have been on a single-sided dual-layer disc like last time, or if it MUST be split, split it between two single-sided discs and make it a 3-disc set.

On the previous DVD, all widescreen extras were enhanced for 16:9 TV's, which is pretty standard practice today. However, everything on here is letterboxed in a 4:3 frame. Absolutely ZERO excuse for this in 2010, especially on features that were given the 16:9 treatment on the previous disc. The only one not letterboxed is the trailer for the 1976 remake, which is now simply open-matte, filling up a 4:3 frame. (This especially bodes badly for the 1937 trailer, which was pillarboxed in a 16:9 frame but is now severely windowboxed in a 4:3 frame.)

The previous DVD's only major shortcomings were that there was no commentary, no documentary, not even any kind of introduction to explain why there's a stretch of several minutes and another brief portion later on in the first half of the film with still photos instead of film. And when I heard the title was being revisited on DVD and for its Blu-Ray debut, I was excited at the prospect of finally getting something that was so sorely missed the first time. Instead, Warner Bros. disappoints by once again offering absolutely nothing. I only knew about the still photos because the first time I saw the film was in 1999 when it aired on TCM and Robert Osborne explained why they were used. Were it not for that, I'd have been wondering what was going on, and although that info is easily found on the internet, shouldn't it also be included on the disc so that viewers don't *have* to go searching on the internet to find out?

With all of my gripes, this really is a good DVD set, and if you enjoy the film, I can actually recommend the upgrade - especially if you own a Blu-Ray player, as with the film looking this good just in SD, it has to look mind-blowing in HD. (Be warned, though, the bonus features disc that comes with the Blu-Ray is the same DVD as in this set.) It's too bad that Warner Bros. letterboxed widescreen features, utilized a flipper disc for the film, and dropped the ball on any kind of retrospective bonus material, but they have at least included an impressive transfer of the film and some nice bonuses. The premiere footage is still wonderful to watch, and it's nice to see all of these alternate takes and to have the radio production of the story and everything else. Hopefully when Warner Bros. visits this title again, and I'm sure they will, maybe they'll rectify some of the mistakes they made the first two times. Until then, this set will satisfy, even if you're left wanting more in the bonus features department.",1278115200,,5237,4.730558598028478
1236866,5,B00000JQU8,"""A Star Is Born"" (1954) is the artistic apex in the careers of both director George Cukor and star Judy Garland. 2014 is the 60th Anniversary of this masterpiece, providing a perfect reason to view it again on Blu-Ray. If you've been blown away by the intense emotions and talents on display here before; well, the Blu-Ray will blow you away again; this time almost to another dimension. The Cukor-Garland ""Star"" has never shined brighter than it does on Blu-Ray.
  The Blu-Ray Book Packaging is classy. The book, compiled by Judy Garland ""historian"" John Fricke, details the making of the classic 1954 version. After opening to rapturous critical reviews, the film was senselessly edited by 27 minutes (Fricke correctly calls this ""the preposterous purge""). In 1983, late film historian Ronald Haver restored ""A Star Is Born"" to 2 hours and 56 minutes, almost Cukor's final cut). Haver used still photo frames to ""fill in"" for a little over 10 minutes where footage could not be found. In 1988, Haver wrote a book about the film and ""restoration experience."" The restored version was released on VHS tape and DVD. And now, here it is, better than ever on Blu-Ray. Fans are still hoping that a complete version will be discovered and released some day.
  The 1954 ""A Star Is Born"" completely eclipses the other versions (a glossy 1937 melodrama starring a sweet and undisturbed Janet Gaynor, and a nonsensical 1976 ego trip for Barbra Streisand) for excellent reasons. Both George Cukor and Judy Garland were battle-scarred Hollywood veterans. Both knew all too well how Hollywood can use, abuse, and throw away talent. The tone of Moss Hart's screenplay is more dark, cynical and acid than the 1937 version. The 1954 version is intensely, painfully personal. And that is why this version is the masterpiece that leaves the other ""also ran"" versions in the dust.
  George Cukor, a highly successful and respected (but not very ""in the closet"" gay) director knew exactly what you had to conceal about yourself-- and the games you have to play-- in order to survive in Hollywood. But Cukor's ""A Star Is Born"" is all about revealing, rather than concealing,  everything. Cukor deftly explores, and in several scenes exploits, the darker, edgier aspects of Judy Garland's complex personality. Judy's potent performance power was often held back in her more lightweight MGM musicals. Here, in Cukor's full-force drama, Judy's talents and emotions explode. The musical numbers, mostly by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin, are brilliant.  Judy is nuanced, intense, and mesmerizing singing ""The Man That Got Away."" Her 15 minutes ""Born In A Trunk"" medley ends the film's first half on a thrilling high note. Later, Judy enchants us again with a seemingly ""impromptu"" performance of ""Someone At Last."" And when Judy breaks down, she breaks our hearts. After a near nervous breakdown in her dressing room, Judy as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester returns to complete a take of the now restored number ""Lose That Long Face."" The instant switch she makes, from tearful despair to cheerful smiles, is dramatically arresting. Judy had to make that same switch countless times at MGM. By now, she was frighteningly convincing at it.
  James Mason, as the falling alcoholic ""star"" husband Norman Maine, is Judy's equal in heartbreak. The Academy Awards scene, where a wobbly and drunk Norman begs for a job and slaps Esther across the face in the process, is haunting and unforgettable. Norman Maine is the star who falls and fades out, but James Mason plays him with a respectful and even remarkable dignity. Charles Bickford as Studio Boss Oliver Niles, Jack Carson as devilish and devious press agent Matt Libby, and Tom Noonan as Esther's stalwart (and possibly gay??) best friend Danny McGuire are all equally excellent.
  Cukor biographer Patrick McGilligan describes ""A Star Is Born"" as Cukor's most passionate and accomplished film; a ""gut chuck  of nerves and misery-- a musical noir. Was there any  musical in Hollywood history, before the deviations of the 1960's, with quite the shock value?"" The film effectively captures the ""all-time thrill"" of Judy Garland and George Cukor at their artistic apex. But we never forget the pain. As McGillian  notes, this ""A Star Is Born"", one of the most essential and seminal films of the 1950's, also captures a brutal Hollywood where happiness is ""trampled by the blood, sweat and tears of personal ambition.""",1277596800,,4438,5.035470668485675
1236867,4,B00000JQU8,"The quality of the picture and sound on this blu-ray should blow away all of those who have seen previous home video versions of this film. The sound is crisp, clear, and there is a very dynamic use of all speakers without sounding unnatural. The colors are vivid as you would expect from a Technicolor movie, and other than some focus flaws that were inherent from the original film, this is definitely the best this film has looked in years. Why didn't I give this classic 5 stars? How in the heck could Warner Brothers go to all the trouble and expense of scanning, restoring, and color correcting this film without even touching the HORRIBLE quality of the crappy stills used to substitute the remaining missing footage? The gap in quality is even bigger now and it truly detracts from the film. Warner Home Video obviously spent a lot of time on this set between the restoration, extras, and the digibook booklet, which makes their oversite on upgrading the stills even more puzzling. Another positive note is that it's great to have the movie all on one disc (complete with a pause for intermission, sans music though).

The movie still holds up today; sure, at times some of the performances are a little creaky (Tommy Noonan as Danny McGuire really stands out as horribly miscast in a role that is beyond his talents), but thanks to Judy Garland, the songs, and the beautiful visuals of the film, the minor quibbles are quickly forgotten.

The restored footage looks spectacular too, and definitely enhances the story. The missing scenes documented the bond between Esther (Garland) and Norman (James Mason) and explains better why she is willing to sacrifice her career for him.

The extras are found on the 2nd disc and although there are quite a few, it doesn't take very long to go through them. It is really a shame that there is no ""making of"" documentary on here. The rocky production and the restoration are both fascinating stories that are screaming to be told. Instead, there is quite a bit of interesting deleted and alternate footage & audio as well as trailers and premiere footage. Don't get me wrong - I love watching these things and it is amazing that they still exist. Most fascinating is seeing a few of the side-by-side alternate takes for ""The Man That Got Away."" To see the subtle differences and nuances between Garland's performances is really a treat to watch. The booklet portion of this disc is nice to thumb through and has plenty of illustrations, but just like the extras, is very brief on meaty behind-the-scenes  info.

So is this the ultimate version? I don' think so. There is still reason to hope that the missing footage will eventually be found; hopefully with that version Warners will tell ""The Untold Story"" of how this movie came to be. Being able to put the movie into perspective would make the experience so much richer.",1277424000,,2873,4.738
1236868,5,B00000JQU8,"There's a lot of chatter about the content of this restored film, and while it's definitely typical of the kind of melodrama that pervaded big screens in the mid 1950's, it's true value can essentially be boiled down to a single element:  capturing for posterity one of the greatest talents ever to come out of the studio system; and at a time when her abilities were evolving into something spectacularly beyond just movie stardom - and that's saying alot.  Few performers have been as inconic as Judy Garland.  She's right up there with Marilyn Monroe and James Dean.  This film was a transcendant one for her and can single-handedly define her charismatic talent.
This Blu-Ray belongs in any serious film enthusiast's library.  It's a stunning evocation of the mid-century studio system - both in it's content - and from a studied perspective, as a business.  The transforming industry is epitomized in the expanded size of the screen, and the overwhelming technologies of the time reaching their peak.
There's an insidious notion of success here that's emblematic, and to have Garland's intensity at the center of it is remarkable.  Mason delivers one of his usual, superb performances as a nuanced loser, and is brilliantly able to keep up with Garland's sensational presence.  Cukor's direction, as always, has a humanist element that shines far beyond what the written page has to offer.  As for the musical content: it's simply jawdropping in it's flamboyance and power.  THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY is worth the price of admission on it's own!
This is a quality Blu-ray presentation.  It does exactly what it should and recreates the look of the original theatrical release.  The early CinemaScope lens flaws are intact; but then again, so is the rich, 3-strip Technicolor!  The original, 4-track, magoptical sound has not been tampered with, and offers the original panned-dialogue mix.  The stereo equalization sounds authentic.  As for the compromised restoration, it's better than the studio cut and flows easily enough to enhance the storyline from a character perspective.
This is a film whose historical value shouldn't be underestimated:  it was a groundbreaking musical, and a film that vividly evokes a sense of Americana - very much like George Steven's GIANT and Nicholas Ray's REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE did.",1277337600,,2319,5.095238095238095

Remember,there are certain art forms and stylistic approaches that are somewhat sophisticated and require a certain amount of understanding and experience to appreciate.  This film has behind it one of the most impressive collection of talent anywhere.  Apart from the cast, we have George Cukor, Moss Hart, Ira Gershwin, and Harold Arlen, just to name a few.  The Production design is brilliant and emloyed the artist George Hoyningen-Huene as color consultant.  The ""forgettable"" songs by Gershwin and Arlen include ""The Man That Got Away"" which has become a classic standard and has been covered by everyone from Sinatra to Cher.  Give Turfseer a break.  Probably young and needs to watch again with a more open and educated approach.  How can someone impressed with American Idol appreciate a work like ""A Star Is Born"". The Blu Ray is a gem.",1277337600,,915,5.0198675496688745
1236870,4,B00000JQU8,"I have neither a Blu-ray player nor an HD TV so there was no reason to get the Blu-ray of this release. On my standard def TV the image is not as sharp and crisp as other recent Warner restorations such as My Fair Lady and Wizard of Oz. But, I've learned through some research that this is because ASIB was filmed in single-strip Technicolor and it is impossible to sharpen the image. Actually the print does look a bit cleaner than the old VHS version of the reconstructed film. Just don't expect sharpness throughout. The musical numbers look the best.

Remember that almost 30 minutes of the film was cut after its theatrical release and it was through the efforts of Ron Haver who, in 1984,  was able to find stills to fill in where soundtrack sections were located. That is what this version is and it really fleshes out the story. (And a great story it is!). And it is wide screen, not pan and scan.

What makes this version ""deluxe"" is the additional two hours of new supplemental material. These are all on the second disc which is NOT Blu-ray even in the Blu-ray set. Two hours are the same material as on the last release. The new material includes additional versions of some songs with different costumes and a lot of audio-only bonuses. The disc containing the feature film is double sided with half on each side.

You can see all the details of the bonuses in another ""review"" which copied the info from the press release.

As far as acting goes, James Mason is amazing and perfect for the part. Garland sings her heart out and this is, of course, a must for Judy fans... many of who can quote her lines from the film from memory.

Some day I'm sure Warner will issue the ""Ultimate Edition"" of ASIB but, sadly this is the best it is going to look on your TV. This is why film preservation is so important!

If you've not seen this film, or haven't seen it in years, watch it.. It will draw you in and show you why Garland and Mason were stars. This is a true Hollywood classic.

1236871,5,B00000JQU8,"Not being a writer I just thought I'd add my opinion about the new Blu-Ray version of ""A Star Is Born"" anyway. What more critical review can be said about this fifty six year old classic? Garland's too old, Garland's life mirrors both characters, Garland was troubled while filming, Garland suffered an Oscar loss due to the cutting of the film. Whatever, it's all what it is and this is a ""movie"" it's not reality, it's Hollywood fantasy about Hollywood fantasy. What's all the talk about? The film is an essential film for anyone serious about Hollywood musicals. It's the epic of all of them combined in a way you forget that people normally don't just start singing in their living rooms to playback records. If you're a Garland fan there's nothing to be said, it's all pure Judy. If you're not a Garland fan, never really paid attention to any of her work, watched this film for the first time, you'd be moved by an excellent performance by a seasoned artist. She's was just on top of her game no matter what. Forget about all the technical ""BS"" and hyperbole over how Garland should look, act, sing, be.. and just enjoy this great film. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it. After reading about the Warner restoration to high definition during the past year my expectations were probably out of proportion due to all the hype of the restoration itself. While watching it on blu-ray, and seeing the last restoration at Radio City Music Hall when it premiered in 1983,then on DVD, I kept thinking is it really ""better"" or is it the hype? I really don't know. Watching it on blu-ray seems ""brighter"" to me but I really don't know what I expected and it really didn't make an impact on me. It was just the same great film I've seen a dozen times in the past. I think it's still all about making money from Judy Garland's talent which probably will never cease. The new packaging, the extra material, the booklet format is all wonderful and, for now, this blu-ray edition is the latest ""must have"" Garland item but what next? Converted to 3-D? It really makes me wonder what else can be done to this already timeless classic. Judy Garland still is the epitome of the best talent show business has ever or will ever see again and no format will ever change that. She's still simply the very best there is.",1277251200,,2307,4.548076923076923
1236872,5,B00000JQU8,"I love A Star Is Born and I have ever since I saw it first, on TV.  I couldn't figure out how Judy Garland was so old looking, and my father said, ""It's because she's been around the mill,"" so I thought until a recent viewing that she was a millworker while financing her musical career with Danny's band.  Seeing it again, it seems fine that she's not a young girl just starting out, what kind of story would that be?  We want someone who's been hurt by life and who has unexplained traumas in her past (watch closely now, as Garland's face darkens as she remembers waiting tables.  ""I'll never do that again,"" she vows, and I'm thinking, I was a waiter, it wasn't that bad!)....  we don't want a Lola Lavery to be the center of the movie.  Well, ""Lost in Translation"" by Sofia Coppola was a little bit like a Star is Born remake, wasn't it?  The mistake of that movie was in assuming we'd find the heroine enchanting because of Scarlet Johansson's unlived in face and attitude.

Well, enough about that, I just wanted to reiterate that, for the most part, Robert Osborne, Judy Garland was not 15 years too old to play the part.

The movie progresses in infinitely small, naturalistic bumps between one scene and the next, so that we get an almost novelistic drenching in textures and atmospheres, all in the service of character development.  And yet the movie seems ""written"" only in its setpieces, the scenes we all remember, where the characters all more eloquent than we imagine they would actually be in ""real life.""  I noticed last night how the film progresses by revelation, and everything moving the plot forward is something overheard by the protagonists, that shatters their views of reality.  Norman's all content after Esther performs her big ""production number to end all production numbers,"" but then he signs for the delivery boy who calls him ""Mr. Lester.""  Norman at the race track, Libby making a hash of his face, and hearing people whisper (no, not even whisper, shouting) ""He's drunk...  He's been drunk for years.""

Finally the big, and satisfying shock, when Norman overhears Oliver's real opinion of his acting.  The scene should have won James Mason an Oscar, but Charles Bickford is also supremely skillful at delivering the speech in question.  Tom Noonan's big speech bucking up Esther is well done too...  you can't believe she's going to fall for such hokum, and then, when she does, you realize her character has changed and she has ""gone Hollywood"" in a real, and terrible way.

Loved the dressing room at Oliver Niles studios, and the seaside house Norman builds for Esther, but actually I liked the Oleander Arms the best, I think.  It is the most glamorous and evocative motel I've ever seen in the movies or out of them.

But it is a long movie that's for sure.  At the Intermission credit I seriously considered pressing ""exit,"" under the belief that all the succeeding scenes had been scarred into my memory ever since my mill-working days.  But I'm glad I stayed!  I cried, but even when I was crying I thought how vain of Esther to tell Norman, ""Oh, I'll sing to you from the kitchen window, my soft wondering number It's a New World, and yet you'll hear me over the pounding Malibu surf.""",1277164800,,3232,4.649647887323944
1236873,4,B00000JQU8,"The new Blu-ray edition of ""A Star Is Born"", while not perfect, is still a treat, and should satisfy fans of the film. There are accounts of an uncut print of the film in the possession of a collector, but this is the 1983 restoration that has been previously released. The picture quality of the Blu-ray disc is good, but not first rate, due most likely to the source material. Being an early Cinemascope picture, it has some image distortion on the sides and blurring in some shots, although close-ups look great. It just won't look as pristine as a newer film.

The extras are presented on a second disc,  which is a DVD. The widescreen scenes are non-anamorphic, which is kind of puzzling. Most of the extras are on the earlier DVD edition, such as the incredible TV broadcast of the Pantages premeiere,  but there are some worthy new additions. There's  a short, amusingly scripted- sounding  audio -only interview with Judy Garland and Louella Parsons, recording sessions and rehearsals for many of the songs, some outtake footage of ""The Man That Got Away "", and a couple of minutes of color footage of the premiere shot in Cinemascope, alternate takes of ""Here's What I'm Here For"", ""Lose That Long Face"", and Norman's walk into the sea. Most of these have introductions that previous versions have lacked, so it's good to have extra information, although the narrator incorrectly identifies Sonja Henie as ""Alice Faye"".

It would have been nice to have a good, comprehensive documentary about the history and restoration of ASIB, but this is a nice package overall.",1277164800,,1574,4.83271375464684
1236874,2,B00000JQU8,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

About 15 or 20 minutes into 'A Star is Born', I became thoroughly confused as to what was happening in the storyline. Fading, alcoholic screen star, Norman Maine (James Mason), has just persuaded Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland) to quit her job as a singer in a band with the promise that he'll get her a screen test the next day at his movie studio. Maine persuades Esther to take the 'chance of a lifetime' and she vows she'll never work again as a waitress, a job she was slaving away at prior to procuring her current job as a low-rent band singer. The next thing I see are a series of production stills with the film's soundtrack underneath. There are brief glimpses of moving pictures including Esther working as a car hop. I was thinking, 'what gives?'--she stated emphatically she wouldn't be going back to working in such a menial job and here she is, serving all varieties of hamburgers at a fast food joint. And what happened to the screen test that Maine promised to get her the next day?

I was warned by the hosts at TCM (including Alec Baldwin) who introduced the film on TV. They said there was some footage missing but the soundtrack was intact. I didn't know exactly what they meant until I actually saw the 'restoration'. My reaction was, 'Oh my God, I have never seen anything as pathetic as this in the movies'. I had to consult Wikipedia to find out what transpired during the missing footage. Well it seems that Maine was called away early to film on location and forgot to write down Esther's address. When she didn't hear from him, she assumed that he was merely flirting with her and that's when she's forced to take the job as a car hop. Only later, Maine locates Esther and makes good on his promise to help her. Wikipedia also explains that Warner executives chopped the film to pieces after Director George Cukor left to scout locations for a new film. Somehow, the executives didn't realize that by cutting crucial scenes, the film's continuity would be seriously compromised. You would think that despite the fact that that they now had a new version of the film, the cut scenes would somehow be placed in the studio's archives, where they would at least be preserved for posterity. But no, the missing scenes are no longer extant, and I wonder exactly what became of them? Who made the decision to throw them in the garbage can? Even Wikipedia doesn't have the answers.

Despite the missing footage, one can still realize that 'A Star is Born' is a vastly overrated film. Take for starters, the character of Norman Maine. We're told that he's a movie star of great import and even after his death, Oliver Niles (Charles Bickford) the studio head, states emphatically to the studio's publicist, Matt Libby (Jack Carson) that Maine was ""a great guy"". Why exactly is he ""a great guy?"" In reality, there is nothing at all appealing about the character. He's basically a self-centered drunk who attempts to undermine his wife's career out of jealousy. When he drunkenly crashes Esther's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, that underscores what an unlikeable character he is. When he's at the sanitarium and Niles offers him a part to try and rehabilitate his career, Maine is in complete denial, and tells his boss that he has other offers pending at major studios. The coup de grace is when he selfishly commits suicide after he overhears Niles informing his wife that he's all washed up.

And what about the sorry plot of 'A Star is Born'. It's so completely predictable because we know where it's going--Maine intends to do himself in. The only question is how. There's virtually no conflict throughout the film. Early on, Esther easily chooses to go for the screen test over staying with the band (she's already made up her mind after she falls for Maine's charms). Despite the fact that everyone knows Maine is a boorish alcoholic, for some reason he still has enough clout to walk into his boss's office and gets him to listen how good a singer Esther is. It doesn't take much to convince Niles to place Esther, the unknown contract player, in a major motion picture, which leads to her becoming a star overnight. Once Esther becomes a star, there are no longer any surprises. When not singing in overlong and overblown production numbers, she becomes preoccupied with her sad sack husband whose decline is illustrated in a series of repetitious scenes. I continue to maintain that 'sad sacks' who don't like themselves, do not make for good drama!

Finally, there's Judy Garland, who mugs her way through the atrocious plot. The tacky storyline is simply a vehicle for Garland to throw in the kitchen sink as far as presenting one dubious song after another. The producers were so hard up that they had to dig out Al Jolson's old chestnut, 'Swanee', which proved to be Garland's best number, but a tune which seemed completely out of place in this movie. And what of the majority of the songs here? Well, the truth is that most of them do not stand the test of time--they are instantly forgettable and no one remembers them today.

The question remains, was Garland as great as so many say she is? Certainly not in this movie! Yes, she had that big, booming voice and certainly her ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" is a true classic. But just look at her singing and acting here in what is supposed to be her great comeback vehicle--I know many will not agree, but to me, simply put, it's corny and dated.

'Star' has some great cinematography but a storyline that features an unappealing protagonist in decline coupled with the performance of a real life star, also headed downhill.",1276992000,,5660,4.688128772635815

1236886,5,B00000JQU8,"""A Star Is Born"" is a collaboration of the work of the best that stage and screen had to offer in 1954. The book, created by the historic Moss Hart, had been adapted from several areas and a plot that could easily have begun it's life as the very first subtle, feminist plot. The score was written by none other than legenday Harold Arlen (""The Wizard of Oz,"" to name just one) and Ira Gershwin (""Porgy and Bess,"" to name just one). George Chuckor,a director from whose 66 film credits can be extracted ""Gone With The Wind"", ""My Fair Lady, ""Let's Make Love"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"". James Mason (""North By Northwest"") and Judy Garland (""The Wizard of Oz""), carried the leads in this film about a famous movie actor who ""discovers"" a talented woman playing B clubs and places her in the right auditions and screen tests so that her own remarkable talent can jetisons her to a Superstar and he feels as though he's becomes the kept, has-been husband who is driven, in this case, to suicide. This film was expertly produced by Syd Luft, a man of extremed talent who spent most of his adult life managing and producing the Superstar Judy Garland than creating films. Instead he created events. Producing Judy Garland was bigger than producing a motion picture. Even alone in 1954.

This is Garlands finest work as it offers not just a full evening of remarkable acting, dramatic honesty, comic timing and the ability to step back when it's called for, but because it allows us to watch a triple threat-the quintessential triple threat is forever memorized on screen. Where Garland's acting in ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" (1961) was equal to this-including her ability to do character acting and a dialect but she was a supporting player on the screen with Sencer Tracy, Marlene Dietrich, Maximillian Schell, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark, Burt Lancaster and (are you ready?) William Shatner. This was crated, says Nobel winner writer Abby Mann, as an ensemble piece, and Garland's performance hovers above the rest, despite her short screen time.

Still, ""A Star Is Born"" is a remarkable example of what happens when you take the finest people alive and put them all onto the same project. The famous ""Born in a Trunk"" sequence which is taught in musical theatre programs all around the world was treated almost as a seperate film unto itself. The film is top notch. The predecessors are trendy and therefore cause you to chuckle; the Streisand version from the 70's hasn't the support talent that this one has (nor, truth be told, the skill of Garland) though it does have Streisnad's ability to sing and act and for that it's worth a look-later on- but Cuckor's ""A Star Is Born"" is the last film musical to create the sort of public stir that the next Star Wars Feature Film does today, with people lining up months in advance for tickets and scalpers selling tickets on eBay for promotional viewings at a cost that could dent the Federal deficit.

Now if all of the name dropping I've done in this film hasn't done much for you, allow me to suggest this: Purchase the film, see it and get three hundred and forty-seven birds with one stone. For if you don't know Arlen, Gershwin, Luft or Cukor then this is a good way to learn them. And if you don't know Tommy Noonan or Dorthy Parker this isn't a bad way to be introduced. If you don't know Judy Garland you can't be introduced any better, but you must be careful not to lose the keys to your Time Machine, because there's no one on earth who hasn't known of Judy Garland since 1939 when she won a special juvenile oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz""

Garland won an Oscar nomination for this film as well as ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" ""Oz"" didn't win much other than best musical score (Harold Arlen) Best Special Effects and Costumes-all of the rest going to MGM'S other big film that year, ""Gone With The Wind.""

This film, a solid sixty years plus old now, makes absolutely anyone's top 25 list. I think it's time you saw why. And if the plot doesn't seem likely? Well come on: get real.",1271116800,,4038,4.626220362622036
1236887,4,B00000JQU8,"Yes, some die-hard Barbara Streisand fans will prefer that version of ""A Star is Born,"" but Judy Garland and James Mason give able performances herein.  It's just tragic to watch Mr. Mason in this film.  He is so believable as a fallen star and an actor who you just wan to watch, especially as the star of Judy Garland's character rises herein.  They complement each other well and make this film very watchable.  Janet Gaynor, I must add, does a fine job in the 1937 version of this film as well, but since I have chosen to watch Judy Garland's version several more times thus far than Ms. Gaynor's I would have to admit that I have a favorite version and this one is it.  See all 3 if you care too, but if you have only seen the Streisand version you ought to compare it to its 2 earlier incarnations. Cheers",1270598400,,811,4.309210526315789

Everything is done to excess: Judy's decible-registering concert hall bellowing can be off-putting; Cukor's plodding direction, amateur edits and often garish coloring are curiously over-rated. Her character seems to have a personality disorder, abruptly changing moods and appearances with every jarring edit. Also, the movie is too long, explaining the need for cuts: one inexcusable cut however was ""Lose That Long Face"".

GLORIOUSLY RESTORED 2-DISC DELUXE SPECIAL EDITION ARRIVES ON BLU-RAY JUNE 22

Honoring the gripping masterpiece that marked Judy Garland's triumphant return to the screen, A Star is Born (1954) will reveal its stunning restoration by Warner Bros. Motion Picture Imaging (MPI) when it debuts on Blu-ray Disc June 22, 2010 from Warner Home Video (SRP $34.99) in a dazzling 2-disc book format with 40 pages of gorgeous photography, film history and more.

Winner of two Golden Globes* (Best Actress, Judy Garland and Best Actor, James Mason) and nominated for six Academy Awards**, this powerfully moving and glamorous story reawakens when it arrives on Blu-ray Disc for the very first time. Offering the best possible way to see the film at home, the Blu-ray release will also feature impressive bonus content including alternate takes, deleted scenes, excerpts from Garland's audio recording sessions, a collectible book of rare photos, press materials and an illuminating essay by film historian John Fricke. The film will also be released as a Deluxe Special Edition 2-Disc DVD (SRP $20.97) and will be available day and date on Video on Demand from cable and satellite providers and for electronic download from online retailers including Amazon Video on Demand.

Famously reconstructed in the early eighties under the leadership of late film historian Ronald Haver, MPI has meticulously preserved and restored Haver's 176-minute version of A Star is Born to its original luster, bringing back the brilliant, saturated colors and crisp picture. Using cutting edge digital restoration tools, MPI removed heavy chemical staining that affected several portions of the film and utilized an ultra-resolution recombine process to correct the heavily damaged sections. Without this painstaking preservation, the fragile negative stock in which the film was created would surely be near extinction.

""Our colleagues at MPI have not only done a phenomenal job in restoring the impeccable visual style of this great motion picture, but through their work, they have also ensured the survival of this cinematic treasure,"" said George Feltenstein, senior vice president, theatrical catalog marketing, Warner Home Video. ""The unparalleled superiority of Blu-ray combined with one of the best musical dramas ever made, come together to create an unforgettable home entertainment experience that is now preserved for the ages.""

A timeless story, sophisticated in the way it conveys its controversial themes, particularly considering the period of time in which it was made, A Star is Born brought together a cadre of extraordinary talent to portray this evocative contemplation of show business. The film became such a major part of American cinematic heritage that the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

ABOUT THE 1983 RECONSTRUCTION

A Star is Born triumphed anew in 1983 after archivist/historian Ronald Haver spent months ransacking studio vaults to spearhead a reclamation of George Cukor's original edit, ultimately funded by Warner Bros. He located the entire 181-minute soundtrack, along with footage for three lost musical numbers and portions of the deleted dialogue scenes. Where no film existed, Haver used stills-over-track for transition and only slightly trimmed the audio when photographic coverage for some sequences was deemed inadequate. Haver's A Star is Born debuted at the sold-out New York Radio City Music Hall on July 7, 1983, with James Mason, Sid Luft, and Garland's daughters Lorna Luft and Liza Minnelli in attendance. Cukor, who had died six months before, was extolled from the stage by Fay Kanin, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had encouraged Haver on his search and co-sponsored the screening. It is Haver's assemblage of the picture that is presented in Warner Home Video's June 2010 release on Blu-ray and DVD.

1236891,5,B00000JQU8,"Recently I saw a 2 hour documentary on the musical lyricist, Johnny Mercer and it was noted in it that Mercer had an affair with a very young 19 yr old starlet by the name of Judy Garland.  However Mercer's wife heard about it and confronted Ms Garland and read her the riot act--thus for as long as he lived, Mercer's feelings for Garland never changed.  In fact the song, ""I Remember You"", is his love poem to Judy.  After seeing this film several times, one can why.  Though I do like the 1937 version with Janet Gaynor and Frederic March, this one is special because of Garland's musical genius. And the songs, everyone tailor made for her talents such as ""The Man That Got Away"", ""Born in a Trunk"", etc.  Also outside of Judy, James Mason delivers an iconic performance as the doomed Norman Maine. So if you have to pick between the '37 version or this one--choose this for Garland and by the way, forget about the terrible 1976 Streisand version.",1262476800,,952,4.479768786127168
1236892,5,B00000JQU8,"I love Judy Garland, and I'd marry her (if she'd have me and if she were alive today.)  Only Louis Armstrong was able to do what she could do at her best, which is to rise to the level of true greatness both in technique and in expression. Just watch the three versions of ""The Man That Got Away"" available on this disc's side two. This great Ira Gershwin/Harold Arlen standard is presented in three different takes, and if I were the director of this movie, I wouldn't want to lose any of them since Garland absolutely nails the song each time. I don't know which is the best version, since she does some different stage business each time. This alone is worth the whole disc, but the medly-like ""Born in a Trunk,"" which is an exteneded scene in itself, almost its own musical, puts everything over the top.  This is essential stuff which is of great value in the history of American popular music ( and of movies).",1246406400,,916,4.414201183431953
1236893,2,B00000JQU8,"I found this DVD release of A STAR IS BORN impossible to watch. The all-too-frequent use of stills over a sound track was extremely annoying. I praise the attempt to recreate Cukor's original concept...but I do not praise the results. I would much rather have seen two versions on the DVD, one with the poor stills-and-dialogue recreation of what was hacked out, and one that's at least watchable. I have to confess that I didn't make it through the entire movie. I couldn't! It was too annoying. I think they should have waited until somebody somewhere can locate missing footage. (However, it's still better than the Streisand/Kristofferson abortion!)",1244160000,,653,5.055555555555555
1236894,5,B00000JQU8,"Any Garland fan who hasn't seen this is in for a treat.  The performances and musical numbers alone are mesmerizing, but the outstanding stereo audio and wide-screen presentation are second only to Judy Garland in making this film one of the all-time best.  The included 'extras' are a wonderful added bonus.",1236211200,,308,5.019607843137255
1236895,5,B00000JQU8,"I had the good fortune to have seen this movie in its original, uncut, length on Christmas Day 1954 at the Pantages Theater in LA. The production number ""Born in a Trunk"" was the last scene prior to intermission. When Judy finished the number, the entire movie audience rose to thier feet and gave that filmed performance a 5 minute standing ovation. To this day, I have never witnessed anything like it. It was pure magic.
I know that many movie critics have rated her performance as the finest by a female performer in the history of show business. I would offer that it was the best by any performer in the history of show business.
Over the years, I have purchased a couple of VHS tapes of the movie. One was the butchered release by Warner Bros. The other was the first attempt
at restoration. Niether of these were satisfactory reproductions.
One of my Grand Daughters is very much involved in theater study and is working hard to fulfill her dream to become a star. I want her to have an advance study guide on ""how to deliver a fantastic performance""
I want her to see the all time epic movie star performance, so I purchased two copies of this almost fully restored latest version. I must say I am totally impressed. The sound is great on my 5.1 home theater and the restoration is superb.
The supporting cast, led by James Mason, is truly great.
It will always be show businesses ultimate mystery as to why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the greatness of this all time classic movie. Judy Garland and James Mason, without a doubt, deserved Oscars for thier performances.
If I could give this DVD 10 rating, I would. Buy it, you will love it!

1236906,5,B00000JQU8,"There are many famous ""One Liners"", but this is one of the best. I was delighted when the movie is extended to get the full flavor of the film. I have viewed this movie and each time, I get more into the film.  Forget the problems that plagued the production of the movie, or personal problems that Ms Garland had, but give praise to the movie stars, Judy Garland, James Mason, Charles Bickford, and Jack Carson. Charles Bickford was memorable in his role as the studio owner, who knew Norman Maine as no other person could. What a friend!! How many of us have friends who would stand beside us as strongly in life and death?  The dynamics between Garland and Mason is for me electric. One star who is on his way out, finds a star and brings her too life is truly the one good thing he does before he dies. Her love for him regardless  his drinking problem, shows the depth of her love to take him for better or worse, and believe me it did get worse; but she never failed or faultered in her love for him. She was even willing to give up her career when she had just won the Oscar for Best Actress, but in his death, he released her to continue her career; but it took her good friend Danny, to bring her to her senses, to remind her not to let his death be in vain. Each time I hear Judy Garland sing ""The Man That Got Away, sends chivers through me. That magnificant voice crowns her as one of the great performers of her time. Her musical numbers are classics as well.  But I will always remember how at the very end she stood proudly and said, "" Good evening, this is Mrs. Norman Maine""!",1222646400,,1592,4.19281045751634
1236907,3,B00000JQU8,"""A Star is Born"" is still one of my favorite films. But do we really need restored scenes with lines like ""stop the car here a minute"" that aren't all that important to the main plot which is already long enough? If these are restored scenes, make them filmed scenes instead of black and white photos. Be warned that ""Lost Horizon"" is restored like this, too.  I do feel the shortened version kept the plot from flowing into all sorts of strange tangents, like the tropical fruit song filmed for a TV commercial and the feuds of alcoholic Norman Maines(Mason) with guards, police, etc. Jack Warner himself signed a contract for a script under 125 pages, with an option to edit out unneeded parts ""as junk.""  This restored version is altering history Orwell-style. At least make the short version available for viewers to compare.",1215302400,,829,4.75
1236908,5,B00000JQU8,"Yes, it's overlong and dated but not particularly campy.  It is Judy and James Mason at their finest and a still-potent critique of the Hollywood star system.  If you've never seen it, it's a must.  I tried to find it to rent or buy around Oscar time this year, but no store in my area had it.  It would be terrible if this film, which underwent a lengthy and historic restoration in the 1980's, went out of print or became impossible to find in the future.",1205452800,,457,4.27906976744186
1236909,4,B00000JQU8,"DVD was in its infancy in 1999, and at that time, Warner Bros. was still not the greatest studio at releasing good DVD editions of their classic films. However, with the premiere DVD release of the 1954 musical remake of A Star Is Born, Warner Bros. started on the right track.

The film is famous for its amazing dramatic and musical performances by the legendary Judy Garland, in her first movie since being fired by MGM in 1950 after making Summer Stock, as the rising star Esther Blodgett (under the stage name of Vicki Lester); its incredible Cinemascope and Technicolor cinematography; and a stellar performance by James Mason as falling star Norman Maine. What the film is just as famous for, and possibly even MORE famous for, is Warner Bros.' editing of it after theater owners complained about the length, as well as Judy Garland's Oscar loss and the film's 1983 restoration. The film premiered at 181 minutes and was hailed as a trimphant return and tour-de-force performance by Judy. After being butchered to 154 minutes in which entire scenes and musical numbers were reviewed, many felt the film made absolutely no sense and it ended its run with a whimper. Judy Garland was nominated for an Oscar for her performance, but lost to Grace Kelly in what Groucho Marx famously called ""the greatest robbery since Brinks.""

In 1983, film historian Ron Haver did something few, if anyone, had ever attempted - a reconstruction of a film that had been brutally edited after initial release. The film was A Star Is Born, and after several years of searching for elements, Ron Haver was able to restore the movie to just 5 minutes under its original length. The restoration team used whatever they had to in order to make the restoration work - home movies taken on set, whatever deleted footage could be found, even production stills during a stretch of several minutes in between Norman Maine's offer to get a screen test for Esther and the studio makeup scene where none of the footage could be found. Although the use of stills may seem jarring to some people, you must understand that these scenes are absolutely necessary to the development of the narrative. In the cut version, it was simply Norman offering Esther a screen test and then she gets it. Here, we get to see how she struggles and the jobs she takes in order to break into show business, the way most stars in the real world have to do it. Fortunately, the stills aren't used constantly throughout the film, which allows for a much easier viewing experience than if all of the deleted scenes had required reconstruction with still photos. This reconstruction, which George Cukor sadly passed away the day before its first screening, finally allows for a more cohesive narrative and, joyfully, two additional numbers by Judy.

This DVD is absolutely superb for an early single-disc Warner Bros. release. The DVDS boasts a new digitally refreshed transfer with a remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. The video and audio quality are absolutely superb, although new restoration processes could revitalize the video quality even further if Warner Bros. decided to do a new DVD release of this film. The video is presented in its original Cinemascope widescreen theatrical aspect ratio, animorphically enhanced for widescreen TVs.

As with many early DVDs, especially by Warner Bros., this DVD is a DVD-15, or a flipper disc with a DVD-9 (dual-layer) on one side and a DVD-5 (single-layer) on the other side. The DVD-9 side contains the movie, naturally. The DVD-5 side contains the bonus features. What's here is amazing to have - newsreel footage of the premiere and post-premiere party, the kinescope of the NBC broadcast of the Hollywood premiere, three alternate takes of The Man That Got Away, When My Sugar Walks Down The Street, which was deleted from the Born In A Trunk sequence, and theatrical trailers for all three film versions of A Star Is Born - it's interesting to note that all three trailers are anamorphically enhanced - including the 1937, which is given black bars on the side to fit within the 16:9 frame without cropping.

What's NOT here, sadly, is a documentary on the making of the film or at least something on the restoration. Someone who doesn't know much about the history of the film might not understand why there's several minutes of the movie which are mostly shown with still photos instead of film footage, or why some of the footage that IS in the film, such as the scene where Esther is a carhop at a drive-in, is so grainy, dirty, and fuzzy.

Since this DVD's release in 1999, Warner Bros. has gone from being a so-so DVD factory to a company that has finally come to appreciate the immense catalogue of classic film titles that they can release on DVD, and therefore have released the finest DVD editions of some of the greatest movies of all time. With this in mind, I think it's high time Warner Bros. revisited this film with a brand new DVD release - preferably a 3-Disc Special Edition. Disc 1 could contain a brand new digital transfer from newly restored film elements and outdo the already sparkling transfer from the 1999 DVD release. An audio commentary by John Fricke, which could touch on the making and 1983 restoration, would be a nice touch as well. Disc 2 could contain all of the bonus materials from the flipside of the 1999 DVD, plus a new documentary on the making and restoration of the film. And, as a great bonus, disc 3 could contain a freshened-up version of the original 1937 version of the film. While Warner Bros. probably wouldn't undertake a massive digital overhaul of the film just so it could be a bonus on the 1954 movie's DVD, they could at least freshen it up from a 35MM nitrate negative. Since the movie's in the public domain, Warner Bros. could do this easily AND in better quality than any other DVD release available, except maybe for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Image-Entertainment-release/dp/B00068NVGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Image Entertainment release</a>, which is supposedly remastered from the 35MM nitrate elements.

Meanwhile, since Warner Bros. has yet to announce any plans for a new DVD of A Star Is Born, this DVD version will do very nicely. The film, for the most part, looks absolutely excellent, with vibrant color and very little dirt, grain, scratches, etc. The audio is superb, and the bonus materials presented here are completely outstanding. I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD to fans of the film, Judy Garland and James Mason fans, and fans of classic films. Despite necessary shortcomings in the reconstruction, it's a must-see film. In addition, if you enjoyed the songs from this film, you simply MUST own the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2004-expanded-reissue-of-the-film-s-soundtrack-album/dp/B00009KU7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2004 expanded reissue of the film's soundtrack album</a>. The CD is a revelation for those who've owned previous soundtrack editions. The new CD contains much of, if not all of the film's score, including deleted portions, as well as complete songs, including the never-before-heard extended intro to The Man That Got Away, as well as some new gems - When My Sugar Walks Down The Street and the complete audio for The Trinidad Coconut Oil Shampoo Commercial. The CD, like the film, is pieced together from multiple existing elements, such as the film's stereo soundtrack, the mono recordings of the film's score, the mono soundtrack album masters, and even a worn acetate playback disc for the shampoo commercial. If you love the film, Judy, or just classic soundtracks in general, the CD is also a must-own.",1204416000,,7725,5.039906103286385
1236910,4,B00000JQU8,"A Star Is Born explores the dark underbelly of a ruthless Hollywood. Judy Garland plays Esther Blodget whose star is on the rise while her famous husband played by James Mason is on the way down.

Garland is superb in the musical numbers but struggles with some of the dramatics. To be fair director Cukor places huge demands on her with many long scenes. It's ironic that Garland plays the wife of a fading alcoholic star...

In its restored version this film is very long at 3 hours, and the photographs used to fill in the gaps where the film is missing is rather off-putting.

For its time this is quite a hard-hitting film, unglamorous in its depiction of an unforgiving business. There is very little musical score -outside of the musical numbers - of course, which makes this film seem more modern. Cukor lets the actors tell the story.

The film's musical numbers are superb and the film is a great tribute to the talent of Garland. George Cukor's direction is also striking. Visually the film is superb. Definitely worth seeing.",1176163200,,1037,4.681318681318682
1236911,5,B00000JQU8,"Marked by a pervasive sense of melancholy, the 1954 musical version of the familiar Hollywood warhorse will forever be remembered as Judy Garland's most acclaimed work in films. Even though she would go on to a handful of films in the early 1960's, this was her last leading role in a major Hollywood production, an ironic point since she plays an emerging movie star on the rise. True, she doesn't look her best in the film, but her fulsome talent is on full, heart-wrenching display as Esther Blodgett, an obscure but thriving band singer who becomes movie star Vicki Lester thanks to Norman Maine, an alcoholic has-been actor in career free-fall. Their love story and the opposing trajectories of their careers are tracked meticulously by Moss Hart's shrewdly observed screenplay and George Cukor's sensitive direction.

The double-sided 2000 DVD provides the 176-minute restored version, which is just five minutes less than what was shown at the original premiere. Until 1983, the half-hour of footage excised after the premiere was thought lost, but film historian Ron Haver found much of it and supervised an extraordinary restoration effort that includes a necessary albeit brief use of production stills to match up with the complete soundtrack. Even with such technicalities, the resulting film is even more of a landmark musical drama, emotionally resonant in spite of certain pacing issues with the storyline. Cukor's approach is probably more leisurely than the relatively hard-boiled material requires since he includes so many establishing and lengthy shots, but his direction shows his legendary sensitivity toward actors.

While he comes across a bit too robust as a fading matinee idol, James Mason vigorously captures Norman's scornful pride and self-pity. He may lack Fredric March's innate sense of vulnerability in the original, but Mason makes the character's inner torment more palpable. As for Garland, she brings so much of her own history to Esther/Vicki that her scenes feel alive with her vibrant, masochistic personality. She is aided immeasurably by the masterful songs of Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin, most significantly her torchy rendition of ""The Man That Got Away"", as perfect a musical movie moment as has been ever produced. While her work in the fifteen-minute ""Born in the Trunk"" sequence is impressive, it is really later in the film when she soars, in particular, when she segues from the tap-happy ""Lose That Long Face"" into a breakdown scene in her dressing room with sympathetic studio head Oliver Niles portrayed with his typically stentorian fervor by Charles Bickford.

The print condition and sound quality on the DVD are superb. There are also some fascinating extras on the B-side starting with three alternative takes on ""The Man That Got Away"", each distinctive in presentation with costume and lighting changes, a must for Garland fans. Also included is a very brief deleted number within the ""Born in the Trunk"" sequence"", ""When My Sugar Walks Down the Street"". Three vintage pieces have been gathered - a brief newsreel piece of the premiere, a four-minute clip of the Coconut Grove premiere party held after the premiere, and most interestingly, a half-hour kinescope akin to the current-day red carpet pre-shows with an amazing parade of period stars expressing little more than good wishes on their way to the theater. Lastly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of ""A Star Is Born"" are also included.",1169942400,,3472,5.185383244206774
1236912,5,B00000JQU8,"It's hard to impossible to believe that George Cukor's 1954 musical remake of A STAR IS BORN was ever a box-office failure or considered to be anything less than a perfect movie.  Opening with a Hollywood premiere scene similar to the one that begins SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, A STAR IS BORN quickly proves itself a brilliant expose of the cruelty and greed of the Hollywood ""star"" system.  In the now-famous plotline, alcoholic movie actor Norman Maine (James Mason) ""discovers"" aspiring singing star Esther Blodgett (Judy Garland), takes a chance on her talent (she has that ""little something extra,"" he says), and gets her a screen test and a film contract.  She slowly but surely becomes a star, while Norman's ""star"" falls due to his drinking.  They marry, but even Esther's love cannot save Norman from ultimate self-destruction.  This plot summary suggests a ""show-within-a-show""-type musical, and in fact A STAR IS BORN sometimes presents us with a show-within-a-show-within-a-show (we watch Esther watching herself on the big screen, and in her movie she plays a performer) - a conceit that gives the film a disoriented quality, even as Norman is himself unable to distinguish between illusion and reality.

One could almost call A STAR IS BORN the musical for people who normally dislike musicals:  its drama - and particularly Norman's personal drama - is of Shakespearean stature, and all of its musical numbers are either of the ""onstage"" variety or the ""one character [Esther] singing to entertain another character [Norman]"" variety; there is, in other words, no artifice that would be at odds with realistic drama.  Moreover, Judy Garland's singing is so inspired as to disarm any criticism.  ""The Man That Got Away,"" the song that first attracts Norman to Esther, is a classic sequence, from Garland's hummed notes at the beginning to the way the brass matches the power of her voice at the song's climaxes.  Garland has other great numbers, too (all, except those comprising the ""Born in a Trunk"" sequence, written by the team of Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin), including ""Lose That Long Face,"" ""It's a New World,"" and ""Here's What I'm Here For,"" a song symbolic of Esther's willingness to sacrifice everything to care for her husband.

While Judy's performance is great, James Mason's is greatness itself.  His brilliance as Norman Maine lies in the fact that he never allows this tortured man to seem merely pathetic to others; even as he plans his own suicide, he puts a good face on the situation with the help of his good looks and uniquely English wit and charm.  The movie's villain is Norman's press agent (Jack Carson, an actor not known for playing villains), who out of jealousy and spite undermines Norman's courageous effort to stop drinking, by making him believe he can never be anything better than a drunk.  Charles Bickford is the well-meaning studio head, whose flaw is that he is too cautious and conventional in his attempts to help Norman.

Clocking in at three hours (even with a freeze-frame device telescoping some of the action), A STAR IS BORN is a strange film, a combination of backstage musical, Hollywood expose, love story, tragedy, and inspirational story.  That it wasn't fully understood or appreciated when it first appeared is perhaps understandable after all, but it should no longer be neglected.",1168214400,,3348,5.005405405405406
1236913,2,B00000JQU8,"A Star Is Born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons.  By failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star's tragic downfall, the film displays a schizophrenic quality. There is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen.  This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors; it's the nature of the material itself.  Perhaps if we were to see the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters.  Instead, we see Garland's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we're left feeling as empty as the film itself.",1164585600,,789,4.779411764705882
1236914,5,B00000JQU8,"DVD very good, service very good.

However would like to see DVD, CD & book purchases combined for shipping allowance.  Probably would order more.",1163030400,,146,5.041666666666667
1236915,5,B00000JQU8,"I reluctantly gave this superb film 5 stars not because of any shortcomings in the script or the acting-both are unbelievebly good-but because of what the studio had done to the movie.

 It was originally released at over 3 hours in lenght. When exhibitors demanded that it be shortened Warner's obliged by cutting it to 154 minutes. In the early 1980s the studio realized what it really had, and set about reconstructing and restoring the movie.
 Because of initial sloppiness (footage being thrown out), it became impossible to fully reconstruct the film. The result is that there is a segment of some 7 minutes of stills about one hour into the picture trying to restore some of the lost scenes. Gone, too, apparently. is Vicki Lester's screen test.

All of this aside, what the viewer sees on the 1999 digitally restored DVD is superb. The color correction of the nearly 20 minutes it was possible to restore is excellent. The actors' performances are outstanding. Not only is Garland a superb singer and dancer,but the close intimate scenes with Mason radiate a warmth and tenderness rarely captured on film. Mason, too, is superb as Norman Maine. When drunk, his character is absolutely dispicable-becoming phisical and violent. Great, too, is the supporting cast. Jack Carson as the studio publicist Libby plays the role with much more profesionalialism and less corniness than his counterpart Lionel Streater did in 1937.

This is, by far, the best version of the film and well worth owning and viewing- dispite the minor shortcomings of its reconstruction. There is not one corny word of dialog in the Moss Hart script.",1151625600,,1628,4.970588235294118
1236946,5,B00000JQU8,"The story is conventional, the idea isn't new (it was a remake, in fact), but the true victory of this film lies in the creative power and talent behind it. George Cukor behind the camera, Judy Garland in front of it, and Moss Hart penning the words; one could hardly go wrong. Mix with it dazzling performances by the lead and supporting characters, plus the magnetic pull of Judy Garland's mere presence, and you've got yourself an instant classic.

The film opens to all the glitz and glamour that Hollywood provides, with an annual benefit for the Academy. Ester Blodgett performs a number with her band and is suddenly interrupted when drunk superstar Norman Maine staggers onto the stage. Ester makes the most of the situation and comically incorporates him into her act so the audience wouldn't suspect he is drunk. This opening song shows the sheer performance power of Judy Garland and makes it clear why she's labeled ""The World's Greatest Entertainer.""

Norman quickly seeks her out and pushes her to pursue a bigger dream with her remarkable dream, and soon she is a huge star, eclipsing his own. His alcoholism and bitterness, not towards Ester but the industry, soon gets the better of him. Ester and Norman, meanwhile, have fallen irrevocably in love, and it is on the strength of this connection that much of the plot centers around.

Garland's innate vulnerability, as she is so often described, is so fitting to this character that I found myself with moist eyeballs many a time throughout the film (and I'll concede that my eyeballs are loathe to get the least bit wet). Her quavering voice and large dewy eyes ring up a host of emotions that makes you wonder how in heck the Academy could have overlooked this performance.

The musical numbers in this picture are also memorable, the most important of which is ""The Man That Got Away."" Judy Garland doesn't look like she is singing for a camera, but for herself and herself alone. And the audience almost feels the moment is too private to intrude upon. But we quickly forget about that as we're frozen, riveted by Garland's magic. The ""Born in a Trunk"" sequence is elaborate and looks like it took quite a bit of green. And I must say it is a pleasure to see Garland perform ""Swanee"" on a stage, complete with dancers and singers. Another one of those 'little jabs of pleasure' as Norman Maine would say.

Oftentimes when creative heavyweights are mixed together in a venture, the end result is not miraculous. 'A Star Is Born' however, has none of that voodoo. It is a sensational artistic achievement in every department.",1151280000,,2594,4.7555555555555555
1236947,5,B00000JQU8,"This 1953 version is one of the great Hollywood movies. It is also the greatest film performance of one of the greatest of all stars, Judy Garland. And it is complemented by an emotionally powerful performance by James Mason. The story of how little Esther Blodgett rescues the great actor Norman Maine from an embarassment, how they subsequently fall in love and marry, how her career goes up, as his goes down, how he walks out to the sea and takes his own life when he senses he has become just a burden to her, and how she in the last powerful movement , returns to the stage and announces that 'This is Mrs. Norman Maine 'is from beginning to end a gripping and powerful one.

Garland in her musical numbers is at the very peak of her career.

A truly great movie.",1146700800,,769,4.370629370629371
1236948,4,B00000JQU8,"Judy,Judy,Judy! That's all I see in reviews,but man did anyone notice James Mason?What a great actor. His performance is sublime. It seems that some of you got it,if not...watch it again and pay close attention to Mason. Absolutely brilliant! His courtroom scene moved me to tears. Saying little more than a few words,you could feel his shame and hopelessness just by looking at him. Even when he's crying in bed,you see the despair in every tear. Yep,God Bless James Mason,he has never let me down. I can always count on him for first rate entertainment. Go on and give him another shot,you won't be disappointed.",1142726400,,614,4.857142857142857
1236949,5,B00000JQU8,"The concept is not new, a movie about movie making.  But the creative force behind has never been stronger.  Judy Garland had wanted to make a remake of the Janet Gaynor - Frederick March film when she was at MGM but Louis B did not think that it would be right for her.  But new hubby Sid Luft thought otherwise and brought together an A list talent pool from director George Cukor to song writers Harold Arlen (of Oz fame) and Ira Gershwin to playwright Moss Hart (of Kaufman and Hart).

The DVD presents the restored version of the movie.  Theater owners complained about the length and the film was shortened.  This was the first film to have film historians restore a film. The original soundtrack was found but not the original negative.  Some scenes had been discovered, a few scenes used stock footage from the movie and the remaining production stills are used.

The story remains basically the same.  Ester Blodget (Judy) is a singer with a big band.  They are performing at a big Hollywood benefit when a drunken movie star, Norman Maine (James Mason) interrupts.  This doesn't phase Ester, she immediately incorporates him into the number as if it were planned.  Even drunk, Norman knows what Ester did and thanks her, in an over the top way.

Norman goes home and is put to bed.  He has an early location shoot for three months.  He wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to the Coconut Grove looking for Ester but the band has finished their engagement.  Norman finds out that they sometimes go to a small club to jam after hours.  He tracks her down there as she performs ""The Man That Got Away"".  He knows star quality when he sees it and she has it.  The band is going on the road the next day but Norman convinces Ethel to stay behind.  Unfortunately, he has forgotten about his location shoot.

Ester waits for the missing Norman but her funds run out and she seeks employment anywhere.  Eventually, Norman finds the near destitute Ester and arranges her screen test.  (The screen test scene is actually based on Judy's MGM screen test.)  Ester is put under contract but her name is now Vicki Lester.  But Vicki's career is going nowhere to Norman's dismay so when the opportunity arises he arranges for the film head to hear Vicki.  He takes a chance on Vicki.

Vicki's film premieres (Born in a Trunk - the best mega production number ever filmed).  It is an overnight hit.  Vicki will be a major star.  Norman proposes to Vicki and they elope.

Everything is going perfectly. The only problem is that the studio cannot afford Norman's antics anymore and refuses to renew his contract.  Norman decides to clean up his act but he cannot accept Vicki being the bread winner.

This is probably Judy's best performance and is her only Best Actress Oscar nomination.  (I feel she should have won but understand when you take Grace Kelly's three films - The Country Girl, Rear Window and Dial M for Murder - why she won over Judy.)  James Mason is most identified with this film and his great performance (True cinephiles will say Lolita but the average filmgoer probably has never seen the film).  Ira Gershwin is best known as his big brother George's lyricist.  But these are some of his most popular songs and have been recorded by many major artists.

This is not a film to be watched but to be experienced.

DVD EXTRAS on Side B:

Backstage Judy Garland Outtakes -

The Man Who Got Away: This had three alternate takes (17 minutes) - some of which were abandoned because they were Cinemascope takes.  This is unquestionably the key song of the film and it is interesting to see other interpretations of this classic.  Each has a introduction that talks about the scene.

When My Sugar Walks Down the Street:  This was filmed as part of The Born in a Trunk sequence but not used. (1 minute).

Backstage Documentaries -

Hollywood Premiere Newsreel: 1 minute news reel of the opening arrivals.

Pantages Premiere TV Special: 30 minute premiere coverage shown on television.  Up to the 1970's local television stations would carry the star arrivals at the opening of movies.  In essence, these are the original infomercials.  This is a great way to see what movie premieres used to be like.  Major movies used to be premiered at a limited number of theaters for up to a month then released nationwide.  This was the first volley in publicizing an opening of the film.

Cocoanut Grove Premiere Party: 5 minute feature of the opening party probably to be used in a WB newsreel.

1954 WB Exhibitor's Reel: 6 minute excerpt from a larger promotional movie made by WB.  Some footage used was not used in the film.  The film has degenerated but still is viewable.

Backstage Audio Outtakes: Two audio only outtakes.",1138752000,,4733,4.626955475330926
1236950,5,B00000JQU8,"All of the reviews of this film tell the oft-told story, and how the performances are wonderful. They are correct! I have watched this film more times than I can count, and I still find new things to discover about it.

The performances are legendary, and much has been written about the loss of Oscars for Garland, Mason and the film itself, but the legacy of their work has survived the losses magnificently!

Some of the best music ever written by Harold Arlen is in this film, from the power of ""The Man That Got Away"", to the humor of ""Gotta Have Me Go With You"" and ""Lose That Long Face"", to the show-within-a-show of ""Someone At Last"", where Garland does her best to cheer up her husband (James Mason) who has been fired by his film studio and is heading for a deep depression.

Buthered by Warner Bros. after its initial release, and, finally, rescued by film historian Ron Haver, the film is every bit as great as critics said it was in 1954. Despite a slightly dated storyline (actors no longer sign long-term contracts with movie studios, etc.) the story still holds up very, very well. The Hollywood setting is merely a backdrop for what is one of the greatest love stories ever written, and shows the true despair one feels when a loved one is fighting so many demons in their life.

For pure enternament value, for lovers of great acting, for those who love great film music, and for those who enjoy a film with the color and detailed richness of the backgrounds, nothing can beat ""A Star Is Born"". A towering achievement not only for Judy Garland and James Mason, but for director George Cukor, and the supporting cast of Charles Bickford, Jack Carson and the nearly neglected Tom Noonan.

Definitely worth the price and more!",1135728000,,1741,4.585209003215434
1236951,2,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in 1954 with interviews  with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1130371200,,506,4.952941176470588
1236952,5,B00000JQU8,"Read reviews above for many great comments!  Seems the better the movie, the better the reviews!

My two cents here!

Look at the list of fine actors who rejected the

""Norman Maine---great actor on the decline"" ...role!  Montgomery Clift and Cary Grant just being two of them.  Why were these many good and great actors so afraid of playing a real role?

Here, Cary Grant did us a great service in turning this role down after he apparently initially accepted it.  He was a good actor---sometimes great.

But James Mason was almost always great, even in lesser roles.

  And Mason was ahead of his time in not ""protecting"" his image, by only taking ""good guy"" or ""winner"" roles.  He played edgy characters many, many times.

Judy Garland's performance would have  swallowed up any merely good male lead.

But Mason's performances has many nuances to it. He is totally believable as the experienced actor coaching the novice.

Only a great actor could NOT be overshadowed by Garland's great voice and personal vulnerability.

Marlon Brando, in a new style of acting, was different enough to edge Mason out of the Oscar award.  But in retrospect, I think Mason was better than Brando, and both leads in A Star is Born deserved Oscars.",1130025600,,1233,4.785714285714286
1236953,4,B00000JQU8,"This is a movie with numerous solo performances and dancings by Judy Garland, though the dances were inserted a bit too often and not always convincing. Judy Garland's performance was memorable. One particular scene was when Judy Garland came home from the studio, she mustered her energy to redo her rehearsal again for James Mason, her drunkard husband whose career suffered a severe downfall. Since Judy Garland was the only one in the movie who danced and sang, this movie would give an impression different from An American in Paris and the Sound of Music.

This DVD version also contained a number of stills accompanied by the voices of the stars, those part of the film must have been impossible to retrieve. What a pity! I thought those parts were very romantic. Having said that, I must say Judy Garland and James Mason did a wonderful job of portraying the couple - Judy ( a rising star) and James (once the big movie star but was now on the verge of being kicked out from the big Studio). Judy Garland was especially impressive. The ending was thought provoking and Judy's last line simply touching. If only the songs were there but the dances trimmed, this would have been a 10/10 movie to me.",1127433600,,1205,4.657276995305164
1236954,5,B00000JQU8,"A triumphant return to the screen after a four-year absence for the ineffable Judy Garland, this is the quintessential Hollywood story-and a perfect showcase for Judy at the peak of her powers.

1236956,4,B00000JQU8,"This review is for the 1999 Warner Brothers DVD release.

The basic story line involves a veteran actor named Norman Maine (played by James Mason) who discovers a young singer named Esther Blodgett (played by Judy Garland).  Maine has a drinking problem, which finally makes him intolerable for Hollywood studios, but he wins the love of Esther, and they get married.  Mrs. Maine's career as a movie actress/singer skyrockets while her husband's career hits rock bottom and builds up to a climatic ending.

I caught the last 40 minutes of this movie a while ago on Turner Classic Movies and wanted to see it from the start and bought the DVD.  I didn't know the movie was a musical, but I was impressed with Garland's rendition of ""The Man That Got Away"".  The rest of the Garland music was primarily dance numbers and I found them boring and dated and they made the movie drag on seemingly forever.  I will admit that I am not a fan of broadway muscials and I'm sure there are fans of musicals, or Judy Garland buffs that will thoroughly enjoy those types of songs and choreography.  The movie is just about 3 hours long and it didn't seem ""epic"" enough to merit that amount of time in my opinion.  James Mason did a great job acting as always and so did Jack Carson as Norman Maine's publicist.

The DVD transfer and restoration are impeccable with bright, vivid color.  The widescreen cinematography is fantastic, especially the shots of the beach and the house in Malibu.  There are a few short segments in the film that are still pictures accompanied by audio dialogue.  The story behind these missing scenes is due to the studio shortening the film after its release and years later they apparently could only recover the audio but not the video portion of those deleted scenes.  It seems hard to believe that one copy of the original movie could not be found and so that those scenes could be recovered and restored.  There is also some nice bonus material on the DVD.

1236957,5,B00000JQU8,"I consider myself a musical buff to the core, and I have enjoyed this movie very much ever since I first saw it.  I first saw it on the classic movie channel one summer and basically was just then discovering not only musicals themselves, but Judy Garland, beyond what everyone knows here as, ""Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz.""  I hadn't realized the magnitude of her success and that the number of movies she made were many.

This movie allowed Judy Garland to 'strut her stuff' not only as a singer, but as a legitimate actress.  This was an emotionally demanding role, and she truly does prove herself, as she had in previous movies, as an accomplished dramatic actress.

This film has that great, one-of-a-kind movie musical feel of the 1950's.  There is that unique kind of feel these musicals have that no other films have.  This music serves as the perfect back drop for some of Judy's most astonishing vocal performances, including ""The Man That Got Away"", ""Gotta Have Me To Go With You"", and ""Lose That Long Face""(which is an especially feel-good song! Love it!).

One of the highlights of the film, that I was just floored by, is what is the ""Born in a Trunk(Medley)"".  This part is an exerpt of a movie Judy's character,Esther, has just made and is watching at the premiere.  It's a 15 minute compilation and story sequence that is fun to watch, and shows anyone who doesn't already know, why Judy Garland is so highly regarded and remembered as one of the greatest performers who ever lived.  She brings the house down about four times just in this short sequence of about six 'mini' songs!  She's fabulous.

I recommend this film to anyone who loves Judy Garland already or especially anyone who wants to see more of her highly regarded film performances, because this is her at the top of her game.

I love this one quote from a guy who....I suspect probably knows what he's talking about.  He says it perfectly:

""The finest all-round performer we ever had in America was Judy Garland.  There was no limit to her talent.""  Gene Kelly.",1121385600,,2047,4.623268698060942
1236958,5,B00000JQU8,"Gut wrenching drama, great humor and unbeatable musical numbers show all those involved with this classic at the very peak of their careers and in top form!  It's also a surprisingly informative and candid look at the Hollywood star system.

Garland and Mason are perfection in this long, luscious tale that will definitely be among the most watched of your DVD collection.  There are also a few negligible, but nifty special features.",1120608000,,435,5.013888888888889
1236959,4,B00000JQU8,"This film is a must for the film buff--a great story about the old Hollywood system.  The rise of one star and the decline of another.  Beautifully photographed and above all beautifully acted.  Jack Carson plays the role of the heartless studio publicist to perfection.  One complaint though.  I respect the roles that film historians play in this business.  They're important figures in the field of film preservation.  But come on--using photographic stills over audio right in the middle of the movie is just not cool.  ""A Star Is Born"" was shortened for a reason--those scenes which were deleted from the film were not that important.  That could've been saved for the special features.",1106956800,,691,4.991228070175438
1236960,5,B00000JQU8,"According to ""other"" daughter Lorna Luft, mom Judy Garland told her that of all her films, A Star Is Born was her most satisfying.  When you see the new DVD version of it, you will understand why.  Totally self-absorbed as most geniuses were, Garland could best identify with roles that mirrored her own life, just as she was better than anyone (except perhaps Sinatra) at injecting her own psyche into the lyrics of a song.  Not only was the role of ambitious aspiring star Esther was a familiar one to Judy, but also the role of weary, dissipated alcholic superstar Norman Maine, Esther's supportive husband, was far from alien to her.  That Judy could so closely identify with both the lead roles might explain why she had had her eye on A Star is Born for years before the project came into fruition.  She had, in fact, played the role of Esther in A Star is Born in a radio version of the film years before, while an MGM star.  She badgered MGM chief Louis B. Mayer to re-make the 1937 film as a star vehicle for her but was told, perhaps correctly at the time, ""Nobody wants to see you as the wife of an alcoholic.""

Judy and husband Sid Luft, a sometime Hollywood manager/promoter, managed to make a deal with Warner Brothers head Jack Warner that established a partnership to turn out several films, the first among them A Star Is Born.  Firstly it was necessary to put a good crew in place, and to head it all was legendary director George Cukor, whose film successes are too numerous to mention, but was often noted as being a great

""woman's director.""  Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin were selected to write new songs, most noteworthy among them being ""The Man that Got Away.""  The cinematography and costumes are top-rate,

and you WON'T be aware of how good the supporting players are because they perform so well that you won't notice they are acting.  Jack Carson as the bitter, acid-tongued agent Libby particularly noteworthy.  James Mason is perfect casting as the handsome, dashing and successful actor Norman Maine who throws it all away for booze, yet Judy's first choice was Cary Grant.  Grant, realizing that Judy had the plum role, turned down her offer.  It is probable too that the fastidious Grant would not permit himself to behave in the disheveled look of a has-been boozer.  It was rumored that Humphrey Bogart also sought the husband's role, but the Lufts turned down this possibility due to the stars' glaring age difference.  The Moss Hart script is tight, witty and heart-breaking as we see Esther's rise and Norman's fall from stardom.

But to Garland.  It is the role of a lifetime and the screen perfomance of a lifetime.  Her screen role, like her real-life

persona, was harrowingly bi-polar, and whether you want to or not, you'll be on her rollercoaster ride of joyous highs and bottomless lows.  Whether singing, dancing, clowing around or weeping in the depths of despair, your eyes will be riveted to her.

Ironically, A Star Is Born was not profitable for Warner Brothers and the Luft-Warners deal was canceled.  When business fell off dramatically for the legendary ""long version"" of the film, Warner had the film pared down several minutes without the Lufts' participation.  This was so each movie house could add an extra showing, to increase box office.  The resulting shorter film is what most people have seen over the years on television and on VHS.  The new DVD shows as much of the butchered original version as possible.  Warner himself appears in some of the special added informative material, but don't believe he is as cheerful as he seems.  Judy Garland was extremely difficult.  Most geniuses are.",1104969600,,3658,4.7405063291139244
1236961,5,B00000JQU8,"""(That was) the greatest robbery since Brinks"" said Groucho Marx upon Judy Garland's losing the Oscar for ""A Star Is Born"" to Grace Kelly. Politics always exists; and this time it exerted a cruel influence. Judy Garland deserved the Oscar for Best Actress in this film.

Of course, everyone pretty much knows the plot by now; either they've heard of it before they got to this web page or they read Amazon's comments about what Amazon calls this ""essential video."" Judy plays Esther Blodgett, a band singer whose career soars into superstardom when he meets and falls in love with Hollywood mogul Norman Maine, played brilliantly by James Mason. There are some ups and downs along the way, however. (In case you don't know the whole plot, I won't spoil it for you here!)

The film is primarily a vehicle to showcase Judy's talents. She doesn't fail to disappoint! My eyes were glued to her the entire time she was on screen; her acting, singing and dancing were beyond remarkable. She belts out classic Garland numbers such as ""Swanee,"" ""Born In A Trunk,"" and ""The Man That Got Away."" This last song is arguably one of the best Garland signature songs ever along with ""Over The Rainbow"" from a film a few of you may have heard of! GRIN

The love affair between Esther and Norman is well played out: indeed, the acting of all the performers is entirely convincing and made me wish for more high quality films to be put out today!

The plot bravely tackles the problems of the Hollywood life: careers going up and down, lives sometimes destroyed in the process. I agree with the reviewer that the ""performance within a performance"" is fascinating: we see Esther showcase and spoof the 1950s type musical in the scene where she shows Norman the ""big"" musical number (""Somewhere There's) A Someone At Last"" at the studio.

The color and sound are quite good for the time. I agree with the reviewer who writes that 1950s color was not up to today's state of the art. Nevertheless, it is quite impressive. The sound was excellent; the quality of the sound in the restored scenes is usually rather good but not quite as good. The stills used in the restored scenes are not the best but they represent a terrific accomplishment. This movie never should have been cut just for the sake of the almighty dollar. No wonder Judy and director George Cukor were so infuriated they vowed never to watch the film again!

In addition, Garland fans one may note that Judy's real life personality is perhaps best described as a blend of Norman's addictive behavior and Esther's incredible talent and resiliency. I also agree with the reviewer who writes that the plot is based at least in part on the marriage of Frank Fay and Barbara Stanwyck. Good historical reference, sir!

The DVD comes with wonderful extras: an elaborate commercial for ""A Star Is Born"" with Warner himself as host; scenes from the supper party Warner gave after the movie premiere; Hollywood stars arriving for the premiere; and three different filmed versions of Judy singing ""The Man That Got Away"" are just some of them! The movie comes in widescreen which helps to replicate the exact experience the audience had the night of the film's premiere (shortly before it was cut by Warner's so movie theaters could show it one extra time per evening).

In short, if you love musicals, Judy Garland, James Mason, or just plain top notch quality film in general, you simply can't miss this movie on DVD! It is truly one of the greatest movies of the twentieth century starring one of the greatest entertainers America has ever been blessed enough to have: Judy Garland!",1100995200,,3619,4.7242472266244055

1236963,5,B00000JQU8,"If anyone truly deserved the Oscar for the Best Actress of 1954 it was our beloved Judy!!  This movie was a labor of love for her.  She set out to prove that she was not washed up as everyone said she was and that she could still deliver, despite all the turmoil and dysfunction of her life, brought about by selfish, evil, money-hungry people (including her own mother).

One views her magnificent performance with awe and realizes that SHE WAS the GREATEST ENTERTAINER of the 20th Century, beloved by all and not just an icon for gay people (which by the way I am not...I'm just a fan and love her like everyone else, gay or straight).

But that's besides the point.  When one looks at her competition for the Oscar that year.....Dorothy Dandridge in Carmen Jones, Grace Kelly in The Country Girl, Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina, and Jane Wyman in Magnificent Obsession...who can honestly say that anyone of these other actresses stood above Judy's multi-faceted performance!  Judy was the rare talent who could do anything and was a genius!  Grace Kelly winning the Oscar over her was just appalling!!  There was no contest.  Garland deserved and should have won!  I my mind she did.

As for the movie itself, besides Garland, James Mason gives an equally moving Oscar Deserving performance himself as tortured Norman Maine.  Teaming him with Judy was pure magic.

The songs, the cinematography.....all the production values are magnificent.

The DVD (The RESTORED VERSION) is the tops!!  The colors are vibrant and I defy anyone not to get chills up their spine when Judy sings ""The Man that Got Away"" or shed a tear when she accepts her Oscar (in the movie) and says...""I am Mrs. Norman Maine"".

What a movie!!  And what a legacy and tribute to the greatest entertainer of the 20th century...Miss Judy Garland!",1099180800,,1810,4.787096774193548
1236964,5,B00000JQU8,"A STAR IS BORN had its world premiere just over 50 years ago on September 29, 1954.  The 181 film opened in a road-show engagement that was greeted with audience cheers and critical raves. Not technically a ""musical"" as all of the songs are ""performance"" songs rather than plot songs, but featuring a full score written (mostly) by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin.

The film was designed as a starring vehicle for Judy Garland.  Garland's last film was SUMMER STOCK for M-g-M in 1950 and it had not been a big success.  Her studio fired her. She divorced Vincente Minnelli. She went through a series of personal and professonal problems including suicide attempts, comebacks, and tabloid headlines. By the time A STAR IS BORN began filming she was a 30-year old has-been and about to score one of her biggest screen triumphs. Still, the execs at Warner Brothers were nervous. And they were not to be proven wrong: Day after day with the high priced help waiting on the set, Judy sulked in her dressing room.

And yet, the final result was worth it! For if Judy was feeling insecure during the production, she did her absolute best once the cameras were rolling, belting out songs that were like nothing M-g-M had ever given her.  And this is not to take anything away from her co-stars: James Mason, Charles Bickford, Jack Carson and especially Tommy Noonan as her friend and confidante.  This was a major release in the fall of 1954.  It had prestige.

It also had exhibitors complaining about the length and when the grosses dipped the second week Warner Bros panicked.  A decision was made to cut 27 minutes from all subsequent prints.  The exisiting 181 minute prints played out their engagements, then were sent to the studio to be edited to conform to the ""new"" version. Not one single complete print was kept!

In 1982, Ron Haver undertook a massive reconstruction. He had the complete audio sountrack, the two missing musical numbers and some of the footage for a 9 1/2 minute dramatic sequence in the first half of the film. Using stills to cover the missing shots, for about 3 1/2 minutes, he re-assembled the film as close as possible to what had been seen at the premiere.  The film was re-released in the summer of 1983 to great acclaim and it is that version presented on this DVD.

The restored sequences are as follows:

From 40:11 to 50:50 - a series of scenes detailing Norman's being sent off on location while Esther toils at a variety of acting and singing jobs. They reunite, and he makes good on his promise to get her a screen test.  Of this sequence, approximately 2/3 uses stock footage and alternate takes and the remainder ...about 3 minutes ... is covered by stills.

From 1:07:01 to 1:0817 - a short scene showing Norman and Ester driving to the premiere of Esther's first film. For a short segment of dialogue no footage survived and stills are used for approximately 30 seconds.

From 1:27:42 - 1:32:40 - a soundtsgae sequence showing Esther recording the song ""Here's What I'm here For"" is restored complete.

From 2:09:30 to 2:13:53 - A musical seuqence with Esther on the set filming ""Lose That Long face"" is restored complete.

From 2:18:10 to 2:18:52 - following Esther's dramatic dressing room scene with studio boss Charles Bickford, she returns to the set to do one more partial take of ""Lose That Long Face."" Ths sequence is restored complete.

The source for this DVD is a beautiful pristine print with gorgeous technicolor. The stereo sound is good, though showing some deterioration.  The bonus material is fascnating: alternate takes of ""The Man That Got Away""; coverage of the film's premiere; some audio segments that were slightly abreviated for the restoration; and one short musical sequences that was deleted from the ""Born in a Trunk"" montage.

At one point I felt like I was watching a slideshow presentation with music and sound! I had no idea the movie would be so choppy and for that I'm deeply disappointed.
I don't feel like it was worth the price and I probably won't ever watch it again. Too bad too, because what I did see of the performance was good. Unfortunately, I felt like I only got 3/4 of the movie and the rest was fill in the blanks.",1084406400,,618,4.336206896551724

They are both different, both classics and belong in all your collections for you to have a ""rounded-out"" collection of the classics. The version with Janet Gaynor has more ""cute"" moments and the ending is very heartwarming when the grandmother shows up.

1236977,5,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland was an actress of the true MGM mold - that is to say, she knew how to do it bigger, better and louder than everybody else. True of her life, her concert performances and most of her film appearances, and in this 1954 release, she does Warner Bros. proud by being her good old MGM self for an almost three-hour epic.
Surely one of Hollywood's most melodramatic love stories, 'A Star is Born' follows the lives of Esther Blodgett (Garland), a talented star on the rise, and Norman Maine (James Mason), a once-major talent in fast alcoholic decline. They suffer the slings and arrows of the Hollywood machine, and in the end, only one career can survive.
What's truly unique about 'A Star Is Born' is the palpable sincerity and tenderness with which Mason and Garland play their parts. Mason is on top form as Norman maine, and gives a wholly believable account of a man seeking redemption through nurturing a new talent. He's a perfect match for Judy in every way - where her performance is big and larger-than-life, so is his. The actors have a delightful chemistry, a believable bond that fixes us to their story.
Garland gives what must be the greatest performance of her career, imbuing the realtively ordinary part of Blodgett with a luminosity and innocence rarely portrayed in film. When she cries, we truly believe she is sad. When she smiles, we are happy for her. But when she sings, she opens up her character to the audience in a way quite unlike any other. Even in her big, blowzy numbers like 'Swannee' and 'You Gotta Have Me Go With You', she lets her vulnerability and frailty shine through, and we are truly in awe of her. Seminal classics like 'The Man That Got Away' and 'Swannee' are here too, and still ring out as some of the finest examples of songwriting and musical arrangement anywhere.
The supporting cast, though for the most part perfectly sufficient, includes an excellent performance by Tommy Noonan as  Esther's friend and advisor, Danny McGuire.
Direction by George Cukor, is, as ever, exemplary, and sets a standard that few directors have ever managed to equal. He is surely the only man in Hollywood's history to bring such believable humanity to the likes of Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, and Judy garland. His portrayal of a doomed relationship and the effects it has is still as valid today as it was fifty years ago. Using simple, uncomplicated shots and perfectly-pitched performances, Cukor creates the ideal stage on which Garland and Mason play.
The Special Features of this DVD are wonderful - the mini-documentary of the premiere party at Coconaut Grove is a gorgeous slice of a glamorous Hollywood that we'll probably never see again. There are more versions of 'The Man That Got Away' than you can shake a stick at, and 'When My Sugar Walks Down The Street' is a charming, if somewhat pointless, inclusion. The actual DVD quality is excellent, for a movie that's half a century old. Unfortunately, the 'restored scenes' are little more than a series of blurry still shots and audio tracks, but are an important inclusion nonetheless.
All in all, 'A Star Is Born', in terms of technical quality, extras and, most importantly, film standard, is one of the best films of all time. A must-have that I cannot recommend highly enough.",1071446400,,3287,4.776801405975395
1236978,5,B00000JQU8,"Many films have a convoluted history, but few so much as A STAR IS BORN.  The basic story of a famous Hollywood alcoholic who promotes the career of an unknown--only to see her star rise as his falls--was based on the lives of a number of silent-era figures and first filmed in 1932 as WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD?  After a number of plot changes, the story reemerged in 1937 as A STAR IS BORN starring Janet Gaynor and Frederic March. Then, in the 1940s, A STAR IS BORN was recycled into a radio play--and the leading lady was Judy Garland.

Garland's private life was difficult, and in 1950 she made a highly publicized suicide attempt.  When she proved unable to recover herself quickly, she was fired by MGM amid much negative publicity, and it was assumed her career was over.  But within a few years Garland reemerged as a powerful concert performer, and momentum began to build toward a screen comeback.  Garland, who recalled her radio presentation with fondness, suggested A STAR IS BORN.

The production was plagued with problems.  A number of leading actors turned down the male lead before James Mason accepted.  A considerable portion of the film was shot when Warner Brothers decided to present it in Cinemascope, and this entailed scrapping all previous footage reshooting from scratch.  Garland herself proved typically highstrung, and her temperament led to numerous delays.  The budget ran out of control, and by the time A STAR IS BORN arrived on the screen it had become the single most expensive film made up to that time.

The film's opening seemed to justify all the difficulty and expense.  Critics were positive and the public was eager.  But Warner Brothers remained concerned about the film's length--and although director George Cukor offered to recut the film gratis, the studio hacked it apart.  It was soon apparent that critics and audiences alike were considerably less enthusiastic about the edited version, and the film ended its theatrical release with a whimper.

During the decades that followed the film gained a reputation as a mutilated masterpiece.  A lackluster 1970s remake fueled interest in a restoration, but the missing footage could not be relocated.  In 1983, however, the full, unedited soundtrack and many of the missing scenes were rediscovered.  In working with the film, conservators pioneered the use of still photography to fill in the still-missing scenes, a technique that would be used to restore such classics as GREED, METROPOLIS, and LOST HORIZON.  And upon release, A STAR IS BORN was once again hailed as a masterpiece.

Stylistically, A STAR IS BORN is an aggressive film filled with bright colors, bombastic music, and larger than life performances.  As such, it seems typical of ""blockbuster"" films of the 1950s and 1960s.  But A STAR IS BORN uses this ""bigness"" to a considerably different end than its counterparts: rather than containing garish display for its own sake, it contains it for thematic purpose.

The theme developed by writer Moss Hart and director Cukor (who considered this his masterpiece) is one of the various levels of artificiality intrinsic to show business, and differences between degrees of artificiality are carefully drawn in scene after scene.  The audience enjoys a show--never knowing that the star is blind drunk.  The set crew prepares to film an upbeat musical number--never aware that the leading lady is having hysterics in her dressing room.  A wife watches a private screening of a film--not realizing that her husband is being quietly fired in an adjoining room.

The performances that drive A STAR IS BORN are perfectly in line with the film's juxtaposition of reality and artifice.  Garland offers a justly famous bravado performance in broad strokes and with an undercurrent of artifice that becomes increasingly noticeable as the film builds, underscoring her gradual immersion in and consumption by the film industry.  Mason, in equally brilliant fashion, contrasts her with a performance that becomes painfully realistic as the film progresses.  The dissonance created is quite startling: it is easy to see why the two characters attract each other, but it is also easy to forecast how they will self-destruct.

Although musical numbers abound, A STAR IS BORN is not typical of the genre, for the music does not form the primary structure of the film.  Still, like most other elements in the film, the songs feed into the film's themes--and always in the most ironic way possible.  Near the film's conclusion, Maine ask Vicki to sing for him while he, unbeknownst to her, prepares for suicide.  The song she sings is ""A New World.""  And indeed after Maine's death it will be all of that, a world in which unreality will go unchecked and Vicki will win applause by introducing herself as ""Mrs. Norman Maine,"" turning her private grief into box office salvation.

A STAR IS BORN is profoundly bitter film that for all its brashness operates in a remarkably subtle way to make a very dark statement about Hollywood fame: the entertainment we enjoy on screen is an illusion with a price, and that price is a confusion of reality and fantasy played out with stakes of life and death.  The DVD offers the film in its restored state, in Cinemascope, and with television broadcast footage of the Los Angeles premiere.  If you're serious about film, this is a must-own, must-see.

1236979,5,B00000JQU8,"Everyone watches and adores this film because Judy Garland is so magnificent in it. It's her comeback film and rarely has she been so riveting. But I'd like to concentrate on an aspect of the movie that is curiously (tragically) overlooked: the understated and beautiful performance by James Mason.
Mason's portrayal of the tortured, alcoholic Norman Maine is a performance of depth and grace. Mason was a brilliant, quiet actor who infused Maine with a sardonic sense of humor and a haunting sort of pathos. While this is Garland's picture from beginning to end, I will always argue that it's Mason's character who is central to the movie and that Mason was pivotal in getting Garland's performance to resonate.
Most Garland biographers say that Judy was in love with Mason and that the two had an affair. One senses their chemistry and Judy's almost desperate willingness to please the handsome British star. Their interplay together is touching and holds up wonderfully well after half a century. I contrast the Garland-Mason chemistry to the non-existent interaction between Gaynor-March and the dismal Streisand-Kristoferson remake in 1976.
Appreciate also the supporting performances by Charles Bickford and Jack Carson, two characters too-often overlooked. One of my favorite scenes is when Bickford visits Mason in the aftermath of his arrest for DUI, and offers him a script with a supporting role. The proud character of Norman Maine refuses the role and lies by saying another studio is interested in him. Bickford knows this is balderdash, but is so gentle and insistent that he at least try his hand once more at acting.
So watch this marvelous film and enjoy the incomparable talent of Judy Garland, but save a thought and glance for the gorgeous gentleman who played Norman Maine. What an actor he was.",1057276800,,1817,5.080267558528428
1236980,5,B00000JQU8,"A STAR IS BORN is a remake of the very successful 1937 movie. This time lots of good music is added to the story about the rise of a fresh young talent and the simultaneous descent through alcoholism of her actor husband. The script is by Moss Hart and the director is George Cukor.
The performances in the lead roles by James Mason and Judy Garland are superb. James Mason gives a very believable portrayal of a drunk who is disintegrating rapidly in the most pathetic way as the film progresses. Veteran character actors Jack Carson, Charles Bickford and Tom Noonan make their usual dependable contributions.
George Cukor had been a stage manager and had run his own stock company before coming to Hollywood. He won an Oscar for his work in the movie version of MY FAIR LADY in 1964.
A STAR IS BORN was nominated in 1954 for Oscars for Best Actor (James Mason), Actress (Judy Garland), Color Costume Design, Color Art Direction, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Song (""The Man That Got Away"").

I've adored Janet since I was 13 and so the photos of her family added a nice touch -- the tales of her life as told by Paul and Robin were both amusing and heartwarming as well.  I wish A&E had gone into more detail about some of her films -- especially SEVENTH HEAVEN, which is my absolute favourite movie of all time! -- but given that Janet had such a full life they couldn't cover everything in 44 minutes.  The footage from the ""accident"" and her first public appearance thereafter were heartbreaking.  I met Janet briefly in early 1980 and she was warm and vibrant and so full of life -- she didn't deserve the suffering she endured.  Like T.B. I, at first, was hoping the ridiculous ""Janet was a lesbian"" rumour wouldn't even be mentioned.  But I'm glad they did cover it -- hopefully it put to rest once and for all that utter nonsense!  Believe me, I'm not homophobic but give me a break!  All in all this is a wonderful biography of one of Hollywood's greatest Stars and I highly recommend it.

1236982,3,B00000JQU8,"""A Star Is Born"" was Judy Garland's comeback film after nearly a four year hiatus from the screen.  Judy is Esther Bloggett, a singer turned movie star who's rising fame coincides with her husband's (James Mason)meteoric down-swing.  When the film premiered it was hailed as a critical and artistic masterpiece.  Unfortunately Warner boss, Jack L. Warner, thought the film ran too long to get his money's worth out of only two showings per night.  So he set to work chopping whole sequences out and the result was a truncated version that infuriated director George Cukor and cost Judy Garland her Oscar for Best Actress.  In the eighties, film historian Ron Haver set out to restore this movie, only to discover that most of the missing footage remains missing to this day.  However, he did uncover two gems, Judy's ""Lose That Long Face"" and the rehearsal/proposal scene as well as a few outtakes that helped him string together a restoration of sorts using still images to link up the story.  It is this version of the film that Warner has released on DVD and I must say that I'm not sure how to take this re-issue.  Yes, the transfer is as pristine and glorious as Warner Brothers can make it.  Colors are bold and beautiful.  But the portions of film that are missing jar the viewer from fully appreciating the film's performances, particularly in the first half of the movie where nearly 30 minutes of film stock remains lost, with only an audio track to sustain the first time viewer.  To be sure, ""Star"" has never looked or sounded better and it is a blessing to have Judy and James Mason back on the screen in an anamorphic widescreen transfer.  One merely wishes that the missing footage, in whatever condition, would turn up after all these years, allowing ""Star"" to be whole once again.  As a film historian my recommendation is that you buy this disc.  As pure entertainment, you may want to reconsider.",1046476800,,1915,4.711711711711712

  On this one disc, Side A is the Widescreen version, the other side, Side B, are the Special Features.
  In the Special Features section/ Backstage, you will find three major outtakes of Judy Garland singing ""The Man That Got Away"". This is a gem because you will get to hear Judy sing this wonderful song three different times as only Judy can sing it.  Another outtake is from the ""Born In A Trunk"" segment.  Documentary footage includes the Hollywood Premiere Newsreel, Pantages Premiere TV Special (ATTN: Lucy & Desi fans), and the Cocoanut Grove Premiere Party.  Also included is the 1954 Warner Brothers Exhibitors Reel and a couple of audio outtakes.  When I watch this film in DVD I prefer to watch the musical numbers in Widescreen and for the dramatic story , I watch it in Zoom 2X.
  What I personally appreciate in this film is there is a scene where Judy Garland enters a building titled ""Hotel Lancaster"".  I just wonder how that came to be and who was nice enough to call that set ""Hotel Lancaster""?  You see, Judy Garland was once known as Frances Gumm when she lived in Lancaster, California, I believe before she did the ""Andy Hardy"" movies and The Wizard Of Oz.  She later moved and probably thankfully to Los Angeles to be closer to her work.
  This remake version of ""A Star Is Born"" was tailor-made for Judy Garland and is the decided and widely-accepted version of A Star Is Born.  Nothing else compares.  Judy Garland was nominated for Outstanding Actress, but she did not win the Academy Award.  She should have.
 September 4, 2018, will be the 65th Anniversary since Judy Garland pre-recorded the song ""The Man That Got Away"" for A Star Is Born (1954).

1236994,5,B00000JQU8,"Janet Gaynor was the most female popular movie star in America circa 1932 but she is often overlooked by both historians and movie buffs despite having won the first Academy Award for SEVENTH HEAVEN, starred in SUNRISE, certainly one of the ten greatest American silent films; and near the end of her career won a second Academy Award nomination for A STAR IS BORN, most definately one of the most famous films of the 1930's.  Janet's great career sadly does not get the attention it merits because she was under contract at Fox Films, and about the only major superstar they had during that era (late 1920's and 1930's).  Fox made few important films during the 1930's and has done very little about getting them circulated in later decades as opposed to MGM or Warner Bros. where you can still see virtually everything they made during that period.  A&E's Biography has done disappointing few episodes on silent and early talking film stars so I was delighted to see the episode they created on Janet Gaynor.  Lots of wonderful rare film footage is on display as well as interviews with several people who knew Janet, including her third and final husband and also her son Robin Adrian.  There was a minute of distastefulness when the episode acknowledges their are ""gay rumors"" about Ms. Gaynor (three husbands to the contrary) and even shows a book passage from one of those tacky ""gay Hollywod"" books that are often widely discredited, including by Amazon reviewers.  Since A&E has previously ignored the homosexuality-bisexuality of several movie star subjects who were WIDELY KNOWN to be gay it seems quite bizarre to have acknowledged RUMORS about Gaynor when those rumors have been discounted by credible sources.  On whole, however, this documentary is a loving tribute to a very underrated actress who deserves to be better known today.  The moviegoing public of the 20's and 30's didn't just like her, as her husband says ""Janet Gaynor was LOVED.""",1039219200,,1959,4.915151515151515

We are all indebted to film historians who have reconstructed lost portions of this brilliant masterpiece and inserted recently discovered scenes deleted from the film.  Apparently, Jack Warner insisted on cutting a half hour from the picture so that the film could run more often and do better box office.  Director George Cukor went on record saying, ""It was edited brutally, stupidly and arbitrarily, and many of Garland's finest moments were taken out.""  When I was a student, I met George Cukor, and he continued to lament about the disjointed, truncated version of the film.  Now we can celebrate this DVD's release which presents the Garland/Mason A STAR IS BORN now much closer to its original first cut, complete with hilarious original scenes like James Mason's marriage proposal during playback of ""Here's What I'm Here For,"" as Judy croons, ""You drink to muuuuch!""",1036800000,,1107,4.93010752688172

Unfortunately, she lost to Grace Kelly for ""The Country Girl"". The fact that ""Star"" has stood the test of time, while ""Girl"" appears to be an obscure memory, shows the strength of the Garland vehicle.
Much praise should be heaped upon Judy's male co-stars.  James Mason is memorable as Garland's tragic movie star husband.  His work in the film was also worthy of Oscar recognition.  Jack Carson, one of the movie's best character actors, is also quite good as the agent that knows all about the ups and downs of the movie business.  Charles Bickford, as the studio head, balances the professional-in-charge with the father figure in his guidance of Garland and subsequent firing of Mason.

My two stars go entirely to James Mason, who did a very good job here in amongst the melodious maelstrom. I though the scene when he proposed to Esther was quite clever, and probably the only thing really memorable about this poor excuse of a remake. Judy Garland was simply too old for the part and lacked the fresh youthful enthusiasm of Janet Gaynor in the '37 version, which you should see by all means rather than this one, because it is far superior in all ways.",1031788800,,694,4.47244094488189

The casting was ideal, James Mason had me mezmorized with his captivating performance as the drunken falling star, Norman Maine.  ""A Star is Born"" is the story of a drunken actor (Mason) who falls in love with a sweet young singer/actress (Garland).  They marry and he decides to make her a star, with out realizing his star was fading.  As she rises, he falls, and this puts strain on them.  Time goes by and we witness their lives, from Little Bar to the Oscars.  This is a remake of the film, ""A Star is Born"" and ""What Price Hollywood?"", also directed by Cukor.  I've heard some people say that the First ""A Star is Born"" was the best, but I must disagree!  The First one was good, but it went to quickly and it didn't catch you right away.  And sometimes I didn't believe the actors in that one, but I'm not criting that movie, am I?  Another issue attatched to this film is the fact Judy didn't not receive an Oscar for it.  Most people (Yes, most people) believe she should have won the Oscar.  But sadly, she lost to Grace for ""The Country Girl""  I feel that Grace's performance was not as good as Judy's...

I don't mind singing in some movies if it is good ( as in The Sound of Music, Elvis' King Creole and Jailhouse Rock, etc.), but I do not care for Judy Garland's singing. Secondly, I felt Judy was too old for the part. I think she would have been much better in her younger days when she was fresh and beautiful. Thirdly, I didn't see much chemistry between Judy and James Mason. I still feel the 1937 version is best; while I like James Mason (and he is the reason I give this film 2 stars), I felt Fredric March was much better in the Norman Maine role.

1237002,3,B00000JQU8,"I've always wondered why, though it's always referred to as a classic, the Garland A Star is Born is not a movie many people see. Now I know: the Gaynor version is the true classic. The Garland version has a classic talent, a Hollywood legend at pivotal moment, but the movie *itself* is not a classic.
Much of this is not really Ms Garland's fault, though I thought her acting ranged from genuinely touching, to strained, to over the top. The effortless sparkle from her MGM years is missing.  She knows this is her one shot at reviving her movie career, and it shows. It's ironic: so many of her films at MGM were made during some kind of personal crisis, yet they look effortless. Here you can see her *working* to make it look effortless.
Some of the fault must lie with the director, Cukor: The movie has a general air of strained charm, of trying too hard, particularly in the earlier scenes between Mason and Garland. We are supposed to be charmed but are only aware of how hard everyone is trying. (For example, in the ""face cream"" scene, where Mason wipes off the Hollywood makeover, and restores her natural look.) Compare with the Gaynor version, which sweeps you into its world without trying.
Other problems lie with the musical numbers: They go on too long and are somehow lackluster. The songs themselves lack the wit of a Porter or even a Comden & Green. Just compare them to even the least of Judy's MGM musicals: Summer Stock, for example. The director's touch of a Kelly, a Minelli, a Donen is clearly missing here.
I wondered why until I read that ASIB was Cukor's first musical. That makes sense since many of the numbers reminded me of someone who had *watched* a lot of musicals but never really learned what makes them tick. I was actually bored during the lo-o-ng Born in A Trunk number (and distracted by her short black wig and dark makeup), embarrassed during the 'round the world number she performs for Mason, and wondering why I was not charmed during Get That Long Face Lost.
One thing that *was* up to par, however, was Garland's voice. The staging of the numbers might make my attention wander, but the power of her voice lingered, even when the song itself was no classic. The Man That Got Away was one of the numbers that really worked, mostly because it was just Judy.
Also up to par was Mason. This is no career make-or-break for him, and Norman Maine issues from his as smoothly as silk, or smoke from a fine cigar.
Unfortunately, they are too different in type to create much chemistry. Career-wise, they are ships passing in the night.
For me, one of the hardest parts to sit through was Judy/Esther's breakdown in her dressing room. As another reviewer mentioned, it was sad to hear her saying words that could apply so well to herself. Maybe that's why they were hard for her to get out, and why the scene came close to uncomfortable overacting. It was a mistake, too, to have her play that scene in her Get That Long Face Lost costume: straw hat, frumpy sweater, freckles. Bad idea. (Best costuming moment: Vicki's Oscar gown.)
There are other problems in the story. In the first place, it's hard to believe the studio would drop Norman as soon as he marries America's biggest, newest star. At the beginning of the movie, we are supposed to believe he's BIG. Slipping a bit, but still the attraction at a huge premier. If the two stars married, don't tell me the studio wouldn't milk the romance for all it's worth.
But no, they drop him like a hot potato, so that soon he has nothing to do but chip golf balls and answer the phone for Esther. Even the Western Union boy doesn't recognize him. Sure--the studio would keep him in work, if only to keep Esther happy.

After that it goes through the moves: Norman in rehab, Norman turning over a new leaf, Norman failing. Somehow it all lacks drama. Not until Norman overhears the truth about himself from his old boss, and makes his decision, does the movie reach tragic heights. The scene where he pretends everything is wonderful and he is only off for a swim, then wades into the water while Judy sings a lullaby in the background, almost brought tears to my eyes.
Of course, there is always the awareness of art imitating life when watching A Star is Born. Judy lived the Norman Main role. It's impossible not to wonder what might have happened in the Academy had mercifully granted her that Oscar.
However, it might not have been much different. Even as A Star is Born hit screens, the era of the big musical, Judy's only movie genre, was passing. Times were easier, and people no longer needed the escape and comfort musical fantasies provided. TV and rock and roll were also playing their part.  Audiences wanted more sophistication and more sexuality from movies, both exemplified by Grace Kelly. In addition, Judy had been absent from the screen for four years, an aeon in Hollywood time. Perhaps awarding Kelly the Oscar wasn't so much a slap at Judy as a recognition that, sadly, times had changed.",1021420800,,5001,4.579241071428571
1237003,5,B00000JQU8,"This is in many ways Judy Garland's finest hour.  In fact, she is so extraordinary in her two great musical numbers that she almost makes the rest of the movie look bad by comparison.  James Mason provides one of the stronger performances of his career, and Charles Bickford gives his usual rock solid performance, but the movie lives or dies with Judy.  She absolutely makes this film.
Over and over in the history of film, we have seen scenes in which a star is discovered.  Usually, whatever it is that the newly discovered star is doing onscreen isn't really all that spectacular or even impressive.  But we accept from the discoverer that this budding star has star stuff for the sake of the plot.  Not so in this film.  When Judy Garland sings ""The Man Who Got Away,"" the viewer doesn't need James Mason or anyone else telling us that she has what it takes to be a star.  Her performance of that song is not just perhaps her best single moment in cinema, but one of the very greatest vocal performances in the history of film.  When Mason comes to her and says that she could be a star, we say, ""Damned straight!""  The miracle is that when she later performs ""Born in a Trunk,"" she very nearly matches the movie's earlier song.  The irony of the title lies in the fact that with this film, her film career was essentially over.  As magnificent as her talent, the studios could no longer deal with her off screen behavior.  In one sense, the film could have been entitled, ""A Star Ends Her Career.""
It is often repeated that A STAR IS BORN was loosely based on the marriage of Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler, but, in fact, the story is based much more closely on another Hollywood marriage. The 1954 Judy Garland-James Mason version of A STAR IS BORN is a remake with songs added of the 1937 Janet Gaynor-Fredric March film of the same title, directed and partially written by William Wellman.  The 1937 A STAR IS BORN is, in part, an attempt to improve on a previous film scripted by Adela Rogers St. John entitled WHAT PRICE HOLLYWOOD?  (which was directed in 1932 by George Cukor, who ironically directed the Judy Garland remake).  Both Adela Rogers St. John and Wellman were intimately familiar with another Hollywood marriage that became the basis for both scripts.
In the early 1930s Adela Rogers St. John lived next door to Mr. and Mrs. Frank Fay.  Fay was one of the great comedic stars of vaudeville and Broadway in the 1920s.  He had married a young girl who had just graduated from being a chorus girl to appearing in a couple of Broadway plays.  For the first of the two plays, her name was changed from Ruby Stevens to Barbara Stanwyck.  She and Fay met, fell in love, married, and moved to Hollywood to see if they could make it big.  Fay was actually the bigger star in New York, but in Hollywood he was unable to find any roles that suited his talent.  Stanwyck, on the other hand, quickly made a name for herself.  The more successful Barbara became, and the more Frank was rejected by Hollywood, the more he began to drink.  He got into public fights, fought constantly and furiously with Barbara, and was even involved in a hit and run accident.  Eventually, his drinking led to unresolvable marital problems and their marriage dissolved.  But while still married, Stanwyck made several films under the direction of William Wellman, with whom she became close and to whom she disclosed many of the frustrations she was facing in her marriage, providing many of the details of Fay's drinking and her attempts to stick with him..
When William Wellman gave the first version of the script of A STAR IS BORN to RKO studio head David O. Selznick, the latter insisted on a complete rewrite because it was obviously based on the Fay-Stanwyck marriage.  Even after further rewrites, the studios lawyers produced a list of a couple of dozen similarities to Fay and Stanwyck's marriage that could leave them vulnerable to libel.  Additional rewrites finally softened the resemblance.  When doing interviews after accepting his Best Director Oscar in 1937, Wellman just told reporters that the story  was ""based on things that happened.""
Fay, however, did not like Norman Main walk off in an act of self-sacrifice.  In fact, he managed to pull his life together, and in the 1940s achieved a great stage success as Elwood P. Dowd in the stage version of HARVEY, though the screen role went to Jimmy Stewart.",1012780800,,4414,4.62772785622593
1237014,5,B00000JQU8,"As has been said, this film is truly a masterpiece. It's director George Cukor's first film in color, and  full of brilliant acting, singing, set design and cinematography. The ""Born in a Trunk"" sequence is spectacular.
Judy Garland was ""dismissed"" from Annie Get Your Gun just a few years before she made this movie (she would face a similar fate in The Valley of the Dolls shortly before her death; ironically, Patty Duke's character, the brilliant, boozing Neely O""Hara, is said to be based on Garland). But she recovered and made this, perhaps her best, film. It was a phenomenal, almost unbelivable comeback, one of many for her. When you watch the scene where her character loses it as she, on the set of a film she's making,  discusses her husband's battle with booze and his failed career, you can't help but wonder how she managed to get the words out, because she could be talking about her own life. But as grief-stricken as she is, the show goes on, which she demonstrates as she wipes away the tears and performs ""Get Your Long Face Lost."" It's almost chilling, certainly moving, absolutely one of Garland's finest moments on the screen.",1011657600,,1150,4.745
1237015,5,B00000JQU8,I highly recommend this film.  James Mason and Judy Garland both are great in it.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  They don't make them like this anymore.  It's a real classic.,1008374400,,179,4.176470588235294
1237016,5,B00000JQU8,"Returning to the screen four years after leaving Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Judy Garland is just superb in A Star is Born. Always giveing an honest performance, Judy gives it her all in this classic! This movie has it all, comedy, drama, and most of all, music! Co-staring with James Mason, Garland was nominated for an Oscar for her performace! Although she lost is to Grace Kelly (Judy was beat by only one vote I'll have you know! ""The Biggest Robbery Since Brinks!"")she deserved that Oscar! This film is simply great!
The widescreen aspect, offered by this DVD, is an extra treat. Also included are outtakes from the film: including three versions of ""The Man That Got Away"", the broadcast of the premire of the film, tape of the after party at the Coconut Grove, and the film's trailer!
This film is well worth every penny, since it was reconstructed in 1982, after being butchered before it's release in 1954! Buy the video if you have to, but the picture and sound, oh the sound, make me recomend the DVD although it costs a little more it's well worth it!

Let me say from the start that I am not a Garland fanatic, but in this film you can see why so many are. She commands the screen in every scene she appears in, but the ""Born In A Trunk"" sequence is stunning. Grace Kelly was awarded the Best Actress Oscar that year over this performance and it remains one of the, if not THE, worst mistakes by the Academy. Also, James Mason is brilliant in this film, as he so often was. Highly recommended to all who love movies of any genre, as this one packs a punch in musicality, drama and comedy. A true masterpiece (a word overused, but appropriate in this case).",1003276800,,693,4.338461538461538
1237018,5,B00000JQU8,"This film belongs in the library of any serious collector. It is a beautiful love story involvong two people whose mutual dependency on each other deepens as the story progresses. Much of the credit for a job well done of course goes to the films director George Cukor.  Judy Garland returns to the screen after a prolonged absence, and reaches her peak both dramatically and vocally. A pinacle I don't believe she ever achieved again. Her musical interpretations are a credit to George Gershwin and Harold Arlen  James Mason, in his portrayal of an alcoholic movie star, gives a sterling performance. He is always aware of his tendency toward self destruction.""I destroy everything I touch,"" he warns Vickie. Comparing this performance to his portrayal of Brutus in Shakespeares' ""Julius Ceasar"" indeed shows a wide dramatic talent.  All the supporting players turn in solid performances with Charles Bickford as Oliver the studio head and friend to Vickie and Norman, Jack Carson as the studio Mr Fixit and Tommy Noonan as the friend in need.  Truly a movie that is not to be missed.",990403200,,1085,4.945054945054945
1237019,5,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland, arguably the greatest female pop singer of the Twentieth Century, gives the performance of a lifetime in this 1954 musical remake of the 1937 dramatic film of the same name (also available on DVD in a superb transfer).  This movie was perceived as Garland's comeback vehicle since she had not made a film for four years prior and she certainly delivers the goods both dramatically and vocally.  Her singing here is in total service of the music rather than the audience, with none of the over the top indulgences evident in her stage appearances.  The end result is mesmerizing. Garland's standout rendition of ""The Man That Got Away"" deserves special mention since it fully lives up to its hype as one of the greatest vocal performances of all time.
James Mason matches Garland every step of the way and in some areas surpasses her in the role of her alcoholic husband whose star is waning as hers is rising.  In fact, the entire cast, including Charles Bickford, Jack Carson and Tommy Noonan give excellent performances.  Director George Cukor seems to have known just when to reign in Garland and exactly when to let her go and do what she does best.  This is especially evident in the ""Born In A Trunk"" musical number.  Cukor also shows a flair for getting the best out of the then new wide screen CinemaScope process.  His framing of the scenes has an intimacy appropriate to the story but seems revolutionary for a wide screen picture even today.  This DVD showcases the original 2.55: 1 aspect ratio in which A Star Is Born was shown for its initial theatrical presentation and a newly mixed soundtrack preserves the discrete multi-channel stereophonic sound as well.  In fact, this DVD looks and sounds phenomenally good considering that this movie will be 50 years old in about 4 years.
Worth the price of the disc alone is the treasure trove of supplementary material, which includes vintage newsreels, a kinescope of live TV coverage of the Hollywood premiere and no less than four alternate takes of ""The Man That Got Away.""
Judy Garland never was able to equal or top her work on A Star Is Born.  On the other hand, no one else has or could either because she was a one of a kind entertainer that only comes around perhaps once in a millennium.",985910400,,2271,4.680904522613066
1237020,5,B00000JQU8,"The much awaited DVD release of ""A Star is Born"" is finally here. The release was delayed several months, and those of us who tryly love this film hoped that the delay meant that a complete print of the uncut original roadshow film had somehow been located. We have been grateful with the reconstruction, although stills had to be used where footage was not available. Someone must have this footage, as the film was in general release when the cuts were made.
Even so, it is so great to see it in DVD and in widescreen. Warners treatment of their musicals is usually pretty shabby, and it took them a LONG time to release ""Star"" on DVD and widescreen.  it seems that every other movie in their catalog was released EXCEPT ""Star"".

1237021,5,B00000JQU8,"Everyone has already given the movie enough superlatives to last into the next century, so I'll just mention some significant tidbits: The restored film gives more details to the intricate and ugly side of the lead character's hustle into the acting business. Because Esther and Norman lose contact with each other (after he's rushed into a location film shoot while hung-over), we finally see Esther work for her supper; after quitting the band she must economize by moving to a cheap boarding house, ghost sing on TV commercials, and moonlight as a drive-in waitress. Also restored is a scene of a drive to a film premiere (which ends up with our nervous heroine hurling her lunch), and perhaps the finest new scene: a soundstage marriage proposal reeking of wit and charm. And, of course, the DVD presentation shows the movie in its proper Cinemascope format- necessary for moments like Ms. Garland's stunning, single-take performance of ""The Man That Got Away,"" and the long monologue between her and studio head Charles Bickford (which really shows off her acting chops). Check it out.",983232000,,1090,5.027624309392265
1237022,5,B00000JQU8,"Any fan of Garland or of the original downsized version of the film will join me in celebrating this restored, panoramic version as well as the enhanced quality and convenience of the DVD.  Those viewers coming to the film for the first time may be less impressed by the restored footage--some of it reconstructed from still photographs--that  brings the film to its 3-hour length.  Having gotten hooked on the film in its shortened theatrical release, I would have no problem with younger, less patient viewers starting with that version, available in older VHS copies.
Frequently overlooked in evaluations of this ""Star"" is the virtuosity, complexity, and richness of James Mason's performance.  In fact, numerous viewings have convinced me it's every bit as striking as Garland's.  Judy supplies the singing and dancing spark, but Mason's subtle facial expressions expose the inner recesses of a soul that's as capable of unconditional love as suicidal despair.  Indeed, there's a ""feminine"" register to his self-destructive, compulsive characterization (Cukor's influence?) that allows us to see through his persona to the ""real,"" off-screen Judy Garland.
Not that Garland is ever less than real herself.  It's practically scary to think that this is the same actress who played Dorothy only 15 years earlier, and yet it's impossible to overlook that connection.  And it's downright infuriating to see Barbara Streisand attempting a reprise of the role some twenty years later.  Her version, which plays like a self-promotional trailer for her ambitions to attain mega-super-rock-star status, might strike us as having ""camp"" value were it not so apparent she intends us to take the film as seriously as she does.  But ""A Star Is Born"" is as much about the power of cinema as of celebrity and fame.  Only a powerful film such as George Cukor's can do the subject justice.",978134400,,1875,5.175496688741722
1237023,5,B00000JQU8,"Judy Garland's character, Esther/Vicki, is too perfect a person for us to find deep resonance with her as she shoots to the top of the movie heap with the help of her husband, played by James Mason. The totally satisfying, complex character is Mason's Norman Maine.  He is a formerly top movie star on his way down in the throes of alcohol and too many enemies made from his own abusive conduct in the Hollywood star system.  He finds momentary surcease from his problems when he meets and marries Esther/Vicki but soon the demons bedevil him again, never to let him go.  He is absolutely fabulous and I wonder that more viewers don't point to this as his absolute best film role. Garland's star turn in this film is in the many musical numbers, where she is stunning.

Those numbers prevent the film from slipping into bathos, which solely focusing on Norman Maine's decline would have accomplished.  I have seen both the unrestored and the restored versions of this film.  This DVD is the restored one and the only version to see.  The DVD also contains outtakes of the hit number, ""The Man Who Got Away,"" which became a signature song for Garland for the rest of her life.  The best version is the one put into the movie.  I've often wondered what this movie would have been like had Garland taken the role she was meant to play, that of a female Norman Maine set on a course of self destruction that no one and nothing can stop.  I would have loved to have seen her do that role but perhaps it was too close to reality for her to attempt it.

1237049,5,B00000JQU8,"Wow!  I am very impressed with the DVD of this film.  I have to admit that the first thing I did (after unwrapping it, of course) was pop it in the DVD player and chapter-skip to the BORN IN A TRUNK sequence.  Ahhhhh.  It is SO NICE to see this film in widescreen.  I knew Warner had done an excellent job with the transfer as soon as those red roses were wheeled in behind Judy Garland in her ""Swanee"" outfit.  Gorgeous!  The ""Peanut Vender Song"" set is GREEN!  Who would have known?  The set and costume design in ""You Took Advantage of Me"" is fabulously clear (Judy's grey suit, red portfolio, matching lipstick...wow!)
The film just looks great.  The soundtrack sounds pretty clear (for a 1954 film...)  The disc is two-sided.  The film is on one side, and the bonus stuff is on the other.  The three versions of MAN THAT GOT AWAY are very interesting.  It is fascinating to see the versions that were filmed.  It seems like they started out too bright.  And Garland's costumes were not flattering.
One note about the non-technical part of the film:  After not having seen A STAR IS BORN for a few years, the main thing that struck me is how incredible Garland's performance is.  She is truly a realistic actor -- not over-the-top and theatrical.  Her scene in the dressing room before LOSE THAT LONG FACE is truly shattering (""I hate him..."").  Garland, besides being a gifted songstress, was a breathtaking actress as well.

1237050,5,B00000JQU8,"Hello everybody, this is Mrs. Norman Maine!
What an incredible classic film!
I've waited forty-five years to see this film again as I saw it when it was first released in theatres,  and it's been worth the wait!  (I just got the DVD this week, and have now seen it for the first of many times, I'm sure.  I'm anxious to see the extras on the DVD, but they can wait -- just having the film in such a restored condition is enough to start.)  (Oh yes, go for the widescreen edition, if you get the VHS tape instead!)
What can I say? --this is the classic Judy Garland, in my humble opinion better than either before or since.  The classic actor James Mason, likewise.  The music, the production, the script, everything about this film is absolutely top drawer, and must be considered to be among the greatest all-time Hollywood films ever.
What I do not know, so cannot represent, is how well it travels over time.  As I said, I saw it when it first came out, and loved it then, at the tender age of fifteen.  I bought the soundtrack, on 45 rpm records, which I still have, and almost wore them out!
For those of you like me who remember it, it's a time travel trip you can't afford to pass up!  For those of you who are younger, it's your opportunity for a truly remarkable glimpse into the past which many consider the golden age of musicals, and so much more as well!
I totally agree with the reviewers who have already contrbuted their thoughts over the past six months, and so have little more content to add.  Suffice it to say that the emotional connection via song was every bit as well established just now as it was forty-five years ago, if not more so!  Especially so for ""Born in a Trunk""!
And, I hasten to add -- If you consider yourself an ""amateur"" of film, you should own this one, just as you obviously own (as classic jazz lovers) Benny Goodman's ""Swing, Swing, Swing"", Dave Brubecks's ""Take Five"", Miles Davis' ""So What"", John Lewis'  ""Django"", etc -- the creme de la creme!  Hopefully, you get the idea.

But to concentrate  on this classic.......to a certain group, Judy Garland will always be  represented by THE WIZARD OF OZ, as a young, innocent girl. At the opposite  extreme, her singing and style in her final movie, I COULD GO ON SINGING,  eximplify the Ultimate Garland.......over the hill, ravaged by time and  circumstances, but still able to absolutely knock you over with belting  renditions of 'Hello, Bluebird' and 'By Myself.' In WIZARD she was a sweet  child, in SINGING she was a staggering Legend. But ah, that beautiful  in-between role in STAR! At the pinnacle of her acting and singing  abilities, she did it all.....to perfection. Legs crossed on the edge of  the stage, tuxedo and top hat, 'Born in a Trunk at the Princess  Theater....' Her voice never had more depth, more perfection. But the  acting was perfect too.....painful acting that left her raw and the  audience too. Begging the head of the studio to re-hire her alcoholic  husband; Trying to cheer up that husband with musical numbers after she's  had a hard day at the studio and he's been sitting at home taking her  messages; humbly standing up to the Judge swearing to take responsibility  for his future; sweetly singing 'their' song from somewhere in the house  while he is out on the beach, preparing himself for the ocean and her  ultimate freedom; the scene when an old friend urges her to leave the  house, and she simply stares into the fireplace.....and finally when she  proudly announces to the world that she is still  ""Mrs.....Norman.....Main."" I doubt if Judy garland ever gave as  much of herself to a part, a character, as she did in A STAR IS BORN. James  Mason certainly never came close to this great a performance in his career,  either. The absolute Hell he goes through in the bedroom, recovering from  his latest drunk while he can hear Vicki in the living room renouncing her  own career for his, was worth at least 6 or 7 Oscars......which means Judy  should have won 19 or 20. So many great stars and great roles have been  overlooked in Hollywood's history...James Mason in this movie, Bette Davis  in ALL ABOUT EVE, Jane Wyman in THE BLUE VEIL, Lana Turner in MADAME  X...but no robbery short of Brink's compares to Judy Garland's lost Oscar  for A STAR IS BORN!",966211200,,2481,4.762352941176471
1237064,4,B00000JQU8,"You`ll relish the majestic opening credits of this film. The music is good.
BUT
George Cukor got overacting from his cast. It`s the same thing that happened on the GONE WITH THE WIND set. Seeing Vivien Leigh in the docu ""The Making of a Legend"" you`ll see a theatrical performance, not the Scarlett Victor Fleming gave us after replacing Cukor 2 weeks after the production started. Indeed, it is the same case here. All good actors, but they are not the least helped by an old warhouse of a script, based on the ""What Price Hollywood""(1932)directed by GEORGE CUKOR. In addition, they are overacting. Witness Judy`s breakdowns in front of Charles Bickford in the dressingroom and the key scene in which she decides to retire in order to take care of Norman Maine(James Mason). Judy`s musical numbers are the highlights of this film. Judy really looks 2 old for a part who screams for a twentysomething of an actress. Another failure is the opening of the film. It`s clear where the Academy Award footage ends and where the original film footage begins and vice verca. It is not however a FAILURE. It is a competent production, but quite uneven. It you are to see Judy in good dramatic turns why not try A CHILD IS WAITING or even better; I COULD GO ON SINGING. And mind you. I have been a Judy Garland fan since I was 10 years old(32 now)......

1237065,5,B00000JQU8,"I love all of the great musicals. Fred, Gene, Doris day, Betty Grable, The Sound Of Music, Caberet, and so on up to this day. I have seen most of them and still intend to see the ones I have missed. Old and new alike !  However, when you take a talent like Judy Garland and James Mason you are  taken completely by surprise by their power and intimacy. Not before or  since has this story been portrayed so well. It has stood the test of time  simply because it is honest and does not follow a trendy style which would  date it. For Garland and Mason this movie was and will always be one of the  greatest of their careers. We have the privelage of being astounded at  their greatness and sad at the fact that Judy and James were robbed of the  Oscar that year. Still they have a movie that we remember and love, which  is more to the point. Who cares who won what for what at the end of the day  'A Star is Born ' is the ultimate winner. It's a smash of a movie, and  worth seeing. Nuff said......",960336000,,998,4.040816326530612
1237066,5,B00000JQU8,"From the glorious overture of ""The Man That Got Away"" to the penultimate closing line, this is Judy Garland's, (and one of Hollywood's) greatest triumph. After her four-year leave from Hollywood, Judy returned  to the silver screen in Cinemascope, full of heart, joy, and everything  that made us love her. In this great dramatic story of Hollywood and its  tragic juxtaposes with reality, Judy plays Esther Blodgett, a singer with a  great undiscovered talent... ""a little something extra"". She is  discovered by alcoholic actor Norman Maine (beautifully and tragically  played by James Mason)and becomes a star by her first picture. While a deep  romance blossoms between the rising star and the fading actor, times are  unkind... Norman is released from his contract and goes on a drinking  binge. (In one of the film's most memorable moments, a drunken Norman  interrupts Esther's Oscar acceptance speech to beg all of Hollywood for a  job.)Judy brilliantly acts the ultra-dramatic role, running the full gamut  of emotions from A to Z. She IS Esther Blodgett. Her dramatic intensity is  so unexpected, it scares the viewer. Judy really should have won the Oscar  for this performance. It would be in any book of legendary performances. On  a lighter note, the picture has an absolute perfect, exciting score: the  brilliantly lit, haunting ""The Man That Got Away"", the thrilling,  over-brilliant ""Swanee"" and the amusing ""Somewhere, There's  A Someone"" and the pensive ""It's A New World"", just to name  a few. With an incredible supporting cast boasting the talents of Jack  Carson, Charles Bickford, Tom Noonan, and Lucy Marlow, the genius script by  Moss Hart, and the direction of George Cukor, ""A Star Is Born""  fills the eyes and ears...and the heart and soul. It should NEVER be seen  without its Cinemascope format. Because you'll also miss out on Judy. Judy,  who so perfectly plays this role...nobody else should have or should EVER  tried to play it. Judy, you're marvelous, I love you, I always will. Thank  you for giving the world such a remarkably incredible movie!",955411200,,2084,5.055882352941176

Its all here even with the added stills to represent what could not be retrieved. Judy is stunning and Mason matches her all the  way. Any description would still not give this film justice..with a great  supporting cast ..a one of a kind film experience.  Imagine going to a  theater tonight and instead of some cuurent fare the house played "" A  Star is Born"" what an evening. Unique",955152000,,478,4.448275862068965
1237068,5,B00000JQU8,I want to concentrate on what a great movie this was and not pathetically correct someone.  Judy's acting was so subdued but explosive that it does seem shady that her film was cut up to pieces and not able to be put back  together.  One of Hollywoods great mysteries.  James Mason was so powerful  that you feel you are watching very private moments that you shouldn't see.  Their chemistry is beyond excellent.  This DVD is the chance to get to see  this film as close to the original intentions as has been possible yet.  Don't let it slip away agian.,947116800,,554,4.46
1237069,5,B00000JQU8,"This was a great film!  Truly one of the greatest and it was chopped to pieces and whole scenes were conveniently ""lost"".  Might this have been to control and put Judy Garland in her place.  The answer has to  be yes.  Her performance was so brilliant (a real shock to people who think  she only sang) and the film such a masterpiece that the money people were  afraid to let her have a success.  Garland so obviously deserved to win the  oscar but did not (the excellent Loretta Young did) and the studio and  money people had so many excuses to bury the film and it's potential.  So  now that it is finally arriving on DVD we finally get a chance to see more  of what should have been.",942796800,,687,4.232558139534884
1237070,5,B00000JQU8,"Although this film was a remake of the 1937 Janet Gaynor/Frederick March film, that version cannot touch the brilliance, luster, intensity and artistry of the 1954 film.  Garland is at her peak, giving one of the  finest acting performances in the history of films.  Garland did not win  the Oscar, which was, is, and always will be a travesty an inexcusable  miscarriage of justice.  For those unfamiliar with Garland who are  interested in the story of ""A Star Is Born,"" the Garland version  stands head and shoulders above the other two films that bear this name.  The third version, with Barbra Streisand, would best be re-titled ""A  Bore Is Starred.""",941932800,,655,4.872727272727273
1237071,5,B00000JQU8,"I saw this recent reissue of the 1954 STAR IS BORN in a store, but did not see it in Widescreen. I was intrigued by all the added attractions, including the Premiere, Original Trailer, the deleted WHEN MY BABY WALKS  DOWN THE STREET, and the fabulous alternates of MAN THAT GOT AWAY.  The  next day in another store, I find the WIDESCREEN EDITION!!  Hallaluah!!  I  have been writing to Warner Brothers since the first edition of the  Restored Version was released to try to get it out in Widescreen, THX,  Surround, etc.  Hence, I've been heard!  Granted, though not THX, Warners  did a superb job in enhancing the restored version.  Even on a mono VCR,  you can tell the difference in the soundtrack, and the widescreen edition  gives you the FULL effect of this great film.  Pan and Scan does not do it  justice.  I was one of many who saw this restored film during its 1983  tour, featuring personal appearances at the theatre by major stars,  including the fabulous James Mason.  I was at the Dallas engagement and was  waiting for Liza or Lorna to appear, as Liza did in NY.  However, I got the  great suprise to have Ginger Rogers come out and say a few words, as did  Fay Kanin of the Academy and Mr. Mason.  We were then treated to this  restored ""wonder"", and the additions of what was deleted added so  much to the story, that it made more sense.  I loved the shortened version,  but did not know until this re-release it had been chopped down.  With the  extra bits for MAN THAT GOT AWAY and WHEN MY BABY that have been added as  supplemental footage, someday someone at Warners will stumble on the cut  footage of the actual scenes that were reconstructed using the still shots  and other supplemental pieced footage.  With the way Film Preservation has  advanced, we may one day see this film in its full form.  As of today, this  new version, including the DVD to come out, is the ultimate version to have  in your collection.  Though it is not labled as a 45th Anniversary Edition,  1999 makes the 45th anniversary of release for this incredible film.  It is  a shame Mr. Cukor did not see the completed reconstruction prior to his  passing, but I am sure God has found a way for him to see it.  It is  marvelous.  Buy it, put your feet up for a few hours and ENJOY!!",940032000,,2283,4.416464891041162
