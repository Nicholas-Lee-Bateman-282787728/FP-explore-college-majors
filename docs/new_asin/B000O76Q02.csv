8183598,2,B000O76Q02,"While it's nice to have a professional DVD release of ""Heart of Humanity,"" the word professional must be placed in very large quotes.  The print might be fine, as has been mentioned by another reviewer, but the digital treatment is not particularly good.  This is a 100 minute film that is packed onto a single-sided disc that already contains ""Birth of a Nation""...which is a three hour movie on its own!  (That's right, each disc here contains over 300 minutes of footage - a ridiculous amount.)

Point being, ""Heart of Humanity"" has actually been accorded less disc space than would be found on a DVD-5 (roughly 2/3rd of the space, to be exact), and significantly less than would be granted to it on its own DVD-9 disc.  The end result is a print that pixelates and motion blurs to a degree that is only passable due to a lack of any other copies on the market.  (Unless one counts Grapevine Home Video's semi-professional release.)

Of course, the same goes for all of the films.  And war movies, being action films, rely on quite a bit of frenetic motion, meaning motion blur crops up rather a lot.

Ultimately, it's better to have ""Heart of Humanity"" than not to have it, as it is an interesting silent film from the nearly forgotten husband and wife team of Allen Holubar and Dorothy Phillips, but I'm wondering if I wouldn't have been better off buying the Grapevine Home Video version.",1208822400,3,1394,4.634146341463414
8183599,3,B000O76Q02,"The set is disappointing on one hand, because despite the advertising, the only silent movies that are really in the set are In the Border States, Birth of a Nation, and Hearts of Humanity- so Four Horseman and Hearts of the World are missing.  But for fans of the genra, the set is worth it for Hearts of Humanity- a good transfer, at a good speed, with good music, of a good film.",1192233600,,382,4.232876712328767
8183600,1,B000O76Q02,"I will try to keep this short because I hated the set so much.  It should have been called ""A Hundred and Two Years of Bad War Movies."".  Out of 5 discs, there were only one or two films I wouldn't burn immediately. ""A Walk In The Sun"" was tolerable.  I hadn't seen it in over forty years, so I forgot how it dragged on and on, and used every trite trick to get the audience to see it as a serious attempt at War Filmmaking.
I am sickened by the thought that I paid $17.99 for such a Ripoff. Most Movies made over 100 years ago aren't worth the celluloid they are printed on.  This set was full of bad movies.

Whoever put it together didn't even bother to improve the quality of the images. They just left in the streaks,flashes, and black swatches and lines.  Perhaps this peice of crud may have been more worthwhile if it had been improved in a good lab.  The folks who released it are charletans, looking for a bunch of films so out of date they had to pay no royalties.  Stuck the movies on 5 DVD's and gave it a catchy, if misleading title.  I'm sorry I wasted the money.  I should have donated the money to a Veterans Organization like the DAV.",1186963200,3,1151,4.1441441441441444
