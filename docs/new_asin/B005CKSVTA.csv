8465616,1,B005CKSVTA,"Those who know me know well that I am fascinated by the warp and woof of different religious fabrics for people. Sometimes it gets very funny, but in an historically dark way. Here is a very interesting one, which shows how nasty subterranean trends in religious ideation never die. The bizarre melange of Nietzschean ""life-affirmation"" nonsense mixed with elements of Jamesian pragmatism, and a corrupted version of Buddhist/Hindu metaphysics once flowered in a very messy, incoherent slurry that undergirded Fascist notions in Europe. (It is not well known that Mussolini was a fan of William James!) But proving that bad ideas never die, and just slime along as an undertow, it is curious that now even young and improbable wannabe ""gurus"" have glommed onto this bizarre slurry and seeking to revive it as a way of making a living. Witness this fellow, one Betinho Massaro about with a little googling. His ""preaching"" here is that only if things feel good are they real. This is the tip off for it is a fraud notion of ""compassion"" which sees no reality in any caring understanding of the sufferings of others, and everything is transmuted in a bizarre melange of Nietzsche and corrupted Buddhist ontology which denies the very reality of anything that does not comport with this quack apotheosis. It is grotesque. Of course Betinho is so uninformed about anything truly to do with historical spiritual understandings and misunderstandings, that he does not grasp the roots of his own ideation in fascist ideation. But some people lamentably are drawn to these harsh and inhumane tropes. But perhaps proof that one should not expect much from this guy is contained in a different Youtube video he has as well where he says that ""getting a new car"" is the same as ""being enlightened"" and if you don't think so then you are not enlightened. LOL!! Showing a bit of cleverness on this young fraudsters part in slyly mixing the bizarre crypto-fascist slurry commercial avarice, which is a sort of obeisance to something he hopes to serve. Of course a side-coincidence of the whole fascist connection is this guy's blond blue-eyed look. Showing there is a cosmic symmetry even for fraudsters-------",1429401600,24,2196,4.970108695652174

8465618,5,B005CKSVTA,"""Everything is a confirmation of Awareness. Even a denial of it is yet another confirmation of it. And so it's inescapable... and the inescapability of this is what makes it so beautiful."" -Bentinho Massaro

If you are into non-duality and are on facebook, you already know who Bentinho Massaro is. In less than a year the exuberant, handsome, and wise-beyond-his-years 23 year old from the Netherlands has gathered a loyal and ever growing following of all ages from all over the world.

Like many, I first began seeing his non-dual posts and was taken with just how amazingly clear and ""on the mark"" they were. Truth has a feel or a vibe to it, and Bentinho's words, his pointers toward our true nature made you feel lighter, freer, and more open. However, it was his spontaneous 2-5 minute YouTube videos that he would make during his day while, for example, walking to the bus stop, that really got people buzzing. In many of the clips, he would begin by just looking lovingly into the lens of his I-phone and then break into a big smile, as if he could barely contain his happiness. And there, right before your eyes, before he even said a word, was ""causeless joy"" in action.

Bentinho was showing us, by example, that Freedom happens naturally when we stop focusing on our constantly changing perceptions, thoughts and opinions, and just rest in/as the unchangeable Awareness that we essentially are.

I was so impressed with him that when he came to the West coast of the United States in the spring of 2011, I invited him to give two satsangs in my Los Angeles apartment and both were a big hit. He has a naturalness and lovingly sweet nature that most people feel instantly. It was obvious, even back then, that Bentinho was a rising star who was destined to touch many people's lives. His skills as a teacher and communicator are excellent, especially when you consider that English isn't even his first language.

""Awareness is that which knows that you are here right now."" -Bentinho Massaro

Additionally, he has very high standards in regards to the material he shares. With Bentinho, it's not about whether one teaching is superior than another, i.e., is ""Advaita"" better than so called ""neo-Advaita,"" but rather, does it work? What can he say to this person, right here and now, that will touch them and help them see what he sees: unconditioned Awareness is our true nature.

""Let everything be a confirmation of Awareness."" -Bentinho Massaro

How this DVD came into existence is a story unto itself. While Bentinho was staying here, I happen to overhear him tell someone that he was going to Temecula, CA after he left my place. Well, that night I was on the phone with Chris Hebard, who mentioned that he might like to do an interview with Bentinho. A bit stunned, I said, ""Chris, Bentinho is going to be in Temecula tomorrow!"" You see, Chris lives in Temecula. And so, the stars aligned, and the next day Chris hired a film crew and the result is this 1 hour and 21 minute DVD, The Emptiness of Being.

The video is comprised of 11 sections:

Introduction * Relax Your Focus * Experiencing * Sensations * Thoughts * Feelings * The Story * The Emptiness * The Coin * A Fresh Set of Eyes * Labels

It opens with Chris asking Bentinho to define Awareness:

Bentinho: ""What is Awareness? Everything else you can point at, except Awareness. Because everything we point at is an object within Awareness. That includes the label ""Awareness,"" that includes an experience that we might associate with the word ""Awareness."" It might be a sensation of being present, or stillness, or silence. Whatever we point at is a perception of Awareness. So in that sense, Awareness itself can never be pointed at.

We can find the contents of Awareness, but we can never really find Awareness. But, we can't deny it either, that's the funny thing. If I say I don't exist, that would be a confirmation of my being aware to even understand the question.

So, everything is a confirmation of Awareness. Nothing is an indication of non-awareness. Try NOT to be aware! If you can say anything, then you are aware. Because every denial of it is yet another confirmation of it... so it's inescapable.""

Relax Your Focus: Because whatever we put our attention on not only gives it energy, but tends to separate it out from the totality of existence, one ""Bentinhoism"" is to ""relax ALL focus,"" meaning don't put your attention on anything specific. You just sort of let your mind go completely blank; you're not thinking, you're being. The idea is to do this again and again throughout the day as many times as you can remember, until this ""thoughtless state"" starts to become a habit.

What you are is Indefinable: Again, it's important to understand that Awareness is not a ""thing"" or an object; it is not locatable in time and space. Rather, it's what time and space appears in or to, so to speak. This is why Awareness is not definable.

Says Bentinho: ""We experience the fact that we exist and that there is a cognizance about that; there is a sense of existing, but even the sense of existing is known. That which knows it cannot be found because it's not a thing; it's not an experience in itself, it's not any particular sensation, it doesn't look or feel like anything... so we cannot define it.""

You are Not Your Thoughts: One of the first and most important realizations in non-duality is that you are not your thoughts. Rather, a thought is an appearance that comes and goes within the Awareness that you are, as Bentinho explained to Chris:

""Thoughts come and go... we recognize that thought is an appearance itself. Usually, we are looking through the thought and thinking about/perceiving from the perspective of thought. And so thought ""thinks"" about this and that. But in this relaxed openness we come to know thought itself as an appearance. [And so] thoughts are allowed, totally allowed. But we know the thought as an appearance itself, rather than perceiving from the perspective of the thought, the label, the description it has, the story it projects onto all these appearances. We come to know the thought itself as an appearance coming and going. Now that's quite a fundamental change already.""

For most of us, it's the belief that we are the thoughts in our head that is responsible for so much, often intense, suffering. Discovering our true nature is about taking a step back and sincerely asking from the heart, ""What is it that is AWARE of these thoughts that come and go unbidden?"" Since the mind cannot know Awareness, whatever it thinks is not it. Yet it can be known, just as you know that you exist and don't need the mind to tell you this.

Doing this type of ""self-inquiry"" can lead to a profound realization: If I am able to observe my thoughts, than I cannot BE my thoughts! And then you realize this also applies to your feelings, emotions, images, and sensations. And finally it hits you at your core: nothing you perceive is You!

Conclusion = Duality: The mind's nature is to compare and conclude, however ANY conclusion becomes a reference point or a dualistic position. Says Bentinho:

""We are not trying to find the ultimate nature to reality because there's nothing to find. We are not trying to find anything; we are not trying to come to any conclusion. Because the moment we arrive at a conclusion, we need a reference point; we need to say, ""Ah, this is how it works,"" then automatically there is, ""This is how it DOESN'T work."" So there's duality right there; there's conflict, there's war... this religion versus that religion.""

""We experience a body experiencing an outer world. But really, the experience of the outer world, as well as the experience of the body, are not happening in two different places."" -Bentinho Massaro

A Fresh Set of Eyes: The last 20 minutes of the DVD is a ""bonus segment"" that came about when Chris spontaneously asked a friend of his who was there watching the taping, to sit and work with Bentinho one-on-one. This proved to be a very powerful and moving experience for Dean, if tears are any indication.

Final Thoughts: It is obvious that Chris greatly enjoyed his time with Bentinho, and the result is a very engaging and intimate interview. As always with Stillness Speaks DVDs, the graphics (in this case an exquisite wheat field) and the music, are first class. This is the kind of DVD that you will want to watch again and again, as each viewing is bound to reveal some more nuggets.

Lastly, at the end of his interview, Chris mentions a quote which Bentinho had told me the night before their interview. I will never forget Bentinho sitting in my living room, when I asked him what he would say if he could only share one thing with humanity. After reflecting for a few moments, he looked up at me and said with total conviction:

""You are already perfect. You don't have to listen to anything that doubts that. Inadequacy is just a thought.""
