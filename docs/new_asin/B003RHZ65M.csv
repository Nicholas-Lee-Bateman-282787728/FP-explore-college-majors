4184610,5,B003RHZ65M,"I loved this movie, excellent!

The plot is very interesting. You always wonder about this sort of thing, but having a filmmaker follow a young girl through her life as a nudist was really intriguing.",1396224000,2,200,4.714285714285714
4184611,1,B003RHZ65M,"If this was suppose to an accurate portrayal of social nudism, they failed miserably! The acting is pitiful (reminds me of high school drama club acting), the storyline is stupid beyond belief. It is a sad attempt of making a movie about making a movie about nudism, just a bunch of wanna-be's trying to make a name for themselves. Some footage in this movie was also used in Naked in the 21st Century, which is just as horrible as this. If you want a movie that has a honest, accurate portrayal of nudism keep looking becuase this is NOT it!!!",1346630400,6,544,4.45
4184612,1,B003RHZ65M,"Here's an Idea.  Lets make a bad movie about some loon making a bad movie about nudists.  Oh, and let's call it ""American Nudist"".

This isn't a movie.  I'm not sure exactly what it is.
I think I would classify it as a VERY poorly executed attempt at a modern nudist exploitation film.

This movie has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to offer to anyone who is already a nudist nor anyone who wants to learn about nudism.
As a nudist I WOULD NEVER EVER EVER EVER recommend this movie to ANYONE.  In fact, I find it insulting and unfortunate that the word ""nudist"" is in the title.

The one and only good thing about this movie is that I did NOT pay for it.",1336608000,2,642,4.213114754098361
4184613,1,B003RHZ65M,I purchased American Nudist with great expectations of finally seeing a good film that would portray nudism in a good way. While the film did basically that I found it was mostly a cut and paste of Clothes-Free.com news videos. The remainder of the film was very confusing and I sat there waiting for the plot to begin.,1329782400,5,319,4.517241379310345
4184614,1,B003RHZ65M,"This disconnected compilation of scenes constitutes a load of tripe that is not at all about nudism.  This is not a movie, nor a documentary, nor a biography - just a compilation of scenes from one guy who wants to be on screen. I'd give it a negative score if possible. I've consigned my dvd to the dustbin.",1325980800,10,308,4.310344827586207
4184615,1,B003RHZ65M,"I am a naturlist and thought the movie was very boring,to me it never made its point,what ever it was. Could not wait for it to end. Waste of time and money.",1323820800,,157,3.9375
4184616,1,B003RHZ65M,"This movie did not live up to advance billing, nor even to the blurb on the envelope! it's not worth watching!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Nudist/dp/B003RHZ65M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Nudist</a>",1323648000,2,256,9.28
4184617,5,B003RHZ65M,"When I first watched this movie I was a bit confused about the plot but then when I re watched it I realized that the main character Taylor (T. L. Young) is slowly loosing his mind which is shown by his alter egos,by him fending off flying dvd cases, as well as other interesting odd things. An actress/model named Jennifer shows up for one of his casting calls for his movie and becomes interested in him and his movie. At certain points in this movie there are naked people being interviewed by other naked people which is interesting.

There are also a lot of pretty girls some of whom are naked in it which kept my interest for sure.

There were 2 scenes I found to be funny. One was when the main character Taylor jumps into a pool fully clothed and then the 2nd one was when he starts doing a funny dance.

My favorite character was Jennifer (Magda Marcella). She is very pretty. I loved the scene where she gets naked by a pool while a guy watched but you do not get to see anything.",1322784000,2,990,4.25531914893617
4184618,1,B003RHZ65M,Man - I really wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't finish watching it. The acting wasn't that great and editing has way too many jumps. It was difficult to follow and that's not including the fact that lighting & audio were terrible.,1502150400,3,243,4.4222222222222225
4184619,1,B003RHZ65M,Pseudo-artist failure.  Starts no where and goes no where.  No redeeming qualities.,1502064000,,83,5.833333333333333
4184620,1,B003RHZ65M,incoherent. No real emotional content and the male star was a pathetic whiner. Many beautiiful women but the title is VERY misleading w/ pretentions to being artsy.,1501718400,,164,5.111111111111111
4184621,1,B003RHZ65M,The audio editing in this film is terrible - poor balance throughout. The story line is lacking and the acting is at an amateur level. I watched this film as part of my Prime Membership - I paid too much!,1501027200,,204,4.125
4184622,1,B003RHZ65M,Lame,1500508800,,4,4.0
4184623,1,B003RHZ65M,"Some of the worst cinematography I have ever seen. Audio track is even worse. Half the time you can't hear what is being said, other times it's loud enough for a headache. People have said this is partially about him loosing his mind. I think he lost his mind before making this and was not in his right mind when he did make it. The worst 100 dollars he probably ever spent was put into this movie.
No story line, no reality in concept, just a poorly done attempt at film making.",1499126400,8,480,4.228260869565218
4184624,1,B003RHZ65M,"This is a poorly done, content, video and sound wise compilation of content that is so misleading from what the title and description claims. I'm ashamed to admit I watched it in it's entirety. In my defense, it was like a train wreck, I had to watch just to get to the ending. Please do not make my mistake and waste over an hour of your time. Go watch grass grow, you'll be more entertained.",1497744000,7,393,4.253333333333333

4184628,1,B003RHZ65M,This really was a very bad movie (if you want to call it that).  AANR should file a lawsuit against this guy!,1484265600,2,109,3.9545454545454546

4184637,1,B003RHZ65M,"If I could sum up ""American Nudist"" in two words, it would be amateurish and misleading. This movie is supposed to be a documentary-drama exploring ""the modern world of naturism,"" but the end result is exploitative and fails to do anything but blur sexuality with the nudist lifestyle. You have naked people asking naked people insipid questions, and in some cases it turns into a tawdry photo session. As an apparent triple threat, T.L. Young is a terrible actor, director, and writer, and the performances from the supporting cast are sub-par at best. He might have also benefited from learning how to use a tripod.

If you are not a naturist and you were seeking information on the lifestyle, watch ""Act Naturally"" or consult the AANR. This is an insult to real nudists.",1466640000,13,773,4.81203007518797
8403631,1,B003RHZ65M,"This has nothing to do with the title. Clearly the creator of this totally useless film should go back to school an actually get an education in film making! I couldn't give less stars because there still isn't a minus stars rating. Just a hodgepodge of clips stacked one after another, no form, no purpose to the title .",1520467200,,321,4.4576271186440675
8403632,1,B003RHZ65M,"I made it to thirty one minutes. Movie makes no sense. The only redeeming quality would have been some nudity. The main character was supposed to be a nudist but he was always wearing clothes that usually included a light jacket and a hat -- in Hawaii! Waste of time. Maybe it made more sense later in the movie, I will never know because it was too boring to watch any longer.",1519516800,,377,4.25
8403633,4,B003RHZ65M,"American Nudist tells the story of a young nudist and those in his life, and does it with a bold, experimental style all its own.  It gives a peek behind the scenes of the nudist lifestyle and the history of the movement.  If you are a fan of movies like Fateful Findings or Samurai Cop 2, you especially should give American Nudist a look.",1515974400,,340,4.296875
8403634,1,B003RHZ65M,"No idea what it was trying to get at, half the film were clips from the ClothefreeTV, the half were the same shots repeated over and over again.

8403637,3,B003RHZ65M,"People love to eviscerate these films, but as a writer myself interesting ideas count for a lot with me. Reviewers complain about the soundtrack which can be overbearing, but the classical music used is lovely.  The director/actor/writer has this thoughtful genuineness and sensitivity about what could seem so pervy given the subject, but like all the subjects of the film, it becomes painfully obvious he is not an actor.  The acting is amateur, sometimes uncomfortable, and the subjects just are not interesting or appealing. I think with better production values, execution, and more interesting, articulate subjects, this might be a compelling concept.",1506211200,,657,5.431372549019608
