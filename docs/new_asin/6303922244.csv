735794,5,6303922244,"I think it is truly sad that for our country to have had boundaries to not let you have a job simply due to the color of your skin. To me, that should have NEVER happened in the land of the free and the brave. just my take, just my opinion. with that said, I discovered this movie just about a year ago. for some reason TCM did a day dealing with movies dealing with color. I believe it was Martin Luther King's birthday, and I discovered this movie as well as Odds Against Tomorrow. Now to it's credit, TCM used to have a Black History Month segment where they showed all the movies dealing with the African American or Black diaspora experience. But in lieu of the Oscars, they now show 30 Days of Oscar exclusively in February since that is now when the Oscars is now shown live on TV. used to be March. I do hope though, they give us something or we show our own. with that said, this movie is a gem that I never heard of until the day I saw it and it blew me away. Mel Ferrer and Beatrice Pearson plays this couple. He tried to get a doctor's appointment with African Americans but they are blown away by the fact that he looks darn near white, and then he has to stick to getting jobs wherever he could. So, for economic reasons and at the advice of his family and mentor, he takes a position as the local doctor in a New Hampshire town as a WHITE doctor and stayed there for over 20 years. It was to be only a year but one year turned into 20 and to be honest, if it wasn't for the fact that he wanted to serve his country in World War 2 and the investigators found out his ethnicity that the secret began come out. Now, personally,on theory, I am for you being who you are, but what choice had you in the days when they shunned you for being black? I cannot judge those for passing for better economic opportunities back in the day. If this country was more tolerant,these things would have never happened. I plan to get a copy of this movie myself and show it. this is a true gem. Oh, sorry to use this as an afterthought, but the late great Canada Lee, who played a sympathetic policeman to the son who ended up in Harlem after running away from his family when the truth came out deserves major kudos for his small role in the film.",1368921600,4,2243,4.123287671232877
735795,4,6303922244,"I first saw this movie on the Turner Classics on T.V. It provoked my deep interest in African-American history. It is the true story of an African-American family who crossed the ""color line"", and passed for ""white"" in an northern state. I purchased the DVD and have viewed it with select groups for discussion and dialogue. The material is very thought challenging .It is well worth the price. I recommend it!",1357430400,,410,4.788732394366197
735796,5,6303922244,I saw this gem during Black History month on television and just had to have it.  This story should be shown more than once a year.  I greatly enjoyed the movie and believe more would enjoy it.,1355011200,2,193,4.1891891891891895
735797,4,6303922244,"This movie is based on a true story about a black man who looks white.  This movie is a little different from the others in that after graduating from black medical school he tried to get a position in a hospital in a black community but is turned away because he looked white.

He was stuck between a rock and a hard place because when he applied at white hospitals he was rejected because he admitted he was black.

He saves the life of a small town doctor who is ready to retire and offers him the opportunity to take over his practice.  When he tells the older doctor that he is black the doctor tells him that they can keep that fact between themselves.

I won't give the rest of the story away but it is interesting.",1344038400,,722,4.202898550724638
735798,5,6303922244,"Bought mainly as a collector's Item . If you lived through the times where the color of your skin or ancestry is of African origin and it kept you from improving your life in the United States and you were able to Pass (looking White but called a Negro), then this movie should be a reminder of the cruelty that ignorant bigots practiced . Imagine that, bigots have been brained washed from childhood and can't understand why they must hate others even after they have fallen in love, had sex, wanted to marry and have babies with you and not knowing you're a mixture of Black and White or of African decent . These unfortunate, misinformed  creatures can't  decide if color or ancestry is an issue to hate, even if you looked White . Thank God these poor creatures are fading away and being replaced by level headed, educated humans who are marrying out side of their whiteness and having their own mixed children or adopting other brown , black and mixed children .This movie can be indexed in American History as a parallel to the troubles of the Dark Ages in Europe.

735801,4,6303922244,"I learned of this while on an African-American Historical tour in NH. I didn't know that they had real history there. I immediately purchased this film and watched it. Even though this story took place many decades ago, the story is still real today. Folks are passing to ""mask"" who they really are. I plan to share it during our weekly movie matinee during Black History Month. I recommend this if you like history and black and white films.",1315094400,,442,4.6075949367088604
735802,5,6303922244,"Lost Boundaries is a great black american classic movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone that would like to see a wonderful family deal with racisim in the early 1920's in New Hampshire. I purchased two so one could be given as a Birthday gift to my sister.

Just a wonderful film and a joy to see how people really can over come some of this countries race problems.",1173916800,8,374,4.3428571428571425
735803,5,6303922244,"The movie reeks of a certain kind of social realism that would later, in the 1950s, bloom into such ""classics"" as REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, THE WILD ONE, etc, but LOST BOUNDARIES fascinates because of its race theme and the way n which it employs white actors to pass as black, even while the characters are black passing for white.  Alfred Werker, the director, brings a Hawthornean sense of pain and desolation to the New England scenes, which are scary precisely because they're all set in Greek Revival style churches and private houses, very upper middle class, and yet they look like whitened sepulchres, for everything's white without a drop of color, as though some Puritan or Shaker influence from hundreds of years past had interdicted even the slightest shade of color.  Mel Ferrer and Beatrice Pearson are splendid in the parts of the older Carters, Scott and Marcia, the ones who decide to marry because (amng other things) each has exactly the same quotient of black and white blood, although in the secondhalf of the movie, when they are supposed to be grown up with teen children of their own, it's a little ridiculous, and Beatrice Pearson in particular still looks around 14, though bravely the actress agreed to wear what must have been some heavy padding around her hips and waist to make her seem ""matronly.""

Susan Douglas, as her teen daughter Shelley, has a sad face even when she's happy, and when she's sad, misery has no word for it!  The scene where Carleton Carpenter, as her white boyfriend ""Andy,"" stops her as she walks across the bridge where he's fishing, is astonishing: both actors play it with immense conviction, and at the end, when Carpenter can't understand why Douglas won't be going to the dance with him any more, it's heartbreaking: he's so sweet you'd think he was retarded.  (Maybe he's supposed to be?)  It seemed to me that in all the town of Keenham, there was one soul who didn't have a racist bone in his body--thus the town was saved, a la Sodom and Gomorrah?

Richard Hylton, who plays the teen son who comes to find that his family's been living a lie, is also good.  He's like a Dean Stockwell type totally enchanted with his own image (we see him narcissistically examining himself in a mirror, then the mirror turns dark around the edges as he realizes that the beauty he has so admired is that of a ""Negro"").  He runs off to New York, to what looks like some fascinating actual location footage of Harlem, and there gets mixed up in a gun battle between two rival guys who are trying to kill each other.  Happily, Canada Lee is on the case--the great Canada Lee, perhaps the finest actor of the entire piece.

Some of the dialogue is overwritten, some of it seems to be missing, as though the actors were given blank pages and the directions, ""Act with your eyes,"" but the daring of the movie is still very much tangible after nearly 60 years.  You could sink your teeth and bite into it.  I can't imagine how Hollywood could actually have made this movie.  Every note, even the false ones, is perfect.",1148083200,18,3081,4.619047619047619

735888,5,6303922244,"Too bad there are so few movies that touch the insanity of racism. And I'm not only speaking of passing in a CULTure were the patience run the insane asylum and ""Not Being One of Us"" could (and even today) get you killed. The late 40's - early 70's for America and Hollywood movies it seems was going through a period of awakening and introspection perhaps due two world wars and later the Vietnam war, men and women returning home began to question old ideas about their place, purpose, importance in this world? Perhaps they questioned their identity as Americans versus the value of other human beings existence. Plus American society was being judged by other nations as our dirt began to show as a nation so keen on 'Freedom' but supported inequality for other Americans. I'm assuming this was the case as an overtly racist and legally segregated society of the 1940s to early 1980s had Hollywood studios acknowledged America's faults in an honest way.  Instead of today's Hollywood where race movies are watered down to pander to white 'new agey' liberal ideas of racial harmony like 'The Blindside' .  Or even intense movies like '12 Years A Slave'  nearly attributes he entire affair to malady 'Chattel Slavery' to the south and then only a few mean southern slave owners. Movies like '12 Years A Slave' nearly exploit the American tragedy of 'chattel slavery' by glossing over how ""White Supremacy"" in America and other European nations and business supported and benefited from American 'Chattle' slavery of only 140 years ago and how those same nations via Neo-colonialism are continuing to benefit from modernized slavery today and in many ways of everyone not just blacks.",1422662400,,1685,4.905263157894737

735894,3,6303922244,"The important thing to remember here is that the Carter family (Johnston in real life) were white people of mixed racial ancestry and entitled to call themselves ""white.""  Change the tainted partial Negro ancestry to American Indian, and who would dare to say that they were unworthy of their European ancestry and the racial description ""white""? The film is not the anti-passing ""you're not good enough to be white"" screed exemplified by ""Pinky"" and ""Imitation of Life.""  ""Lost Boundaries"" is different in these ways:

1) The family members and their extended kin are all mixed-race whites; there is no black ""mammy"" figure as in ""Pinky"" and ""Imitation of Life,"" where the heroine is presented as a genetic freak with no white kin.

2) The film shows some respect for the fact that many mixed whites victimized by white racial purity laws rejected that nonsense and did not self-police themselves humbling accepting the false ""Negro"" label.

3) The film is honest enough to show that even those who had humbly accepted the insulting ""Negro"" label (which is similar to Jews accepting the ""non-Aryan"" label during the Third Reich) were very uneasy about it and often did things that showed their true white orientation. That is why the ""Carter"" parents not only live as whites in an all-white New Hampshire town, but don't inform their children of the ""taint"" in their ancestry. After the great revelation, Scott Carter even tells his son that there is no reason for him and his sister to not continue living as white.  After all, they ARE white.

4) The Carter family is so white in both looks and culture, it makes the parents look incredibly stupid for ever submitting to the ""Negro"" label in the past.",1387670400,,1704,4.855172413793103

735896,5,6303922244,"My wife knew Dr. Albert & Thyra Johnson on Lihue, Kauai, HI. They were in the same bridge club. He worked at Wilcox Memorial Hospital.  This is a TRUE story of a family that passed as white.  The children were not aware that they were black, and the story revolves around them discovering it.  I knew all of the family, they had four children, and I was close with one of the grandchildren.  They chose to be buried back East where they had lived so long.  Mel Ferrer actually had to finance the picture.  No one in those days would touch the subject.  It was nominated for an Academy Award.  Thrya had told about how she dressed up for the ceremony.  In truth, the way the son (Albert Jr.) found out he was black wasn't the way it was in the story.  Dr. Johnson was the first black man to receive a commission in the service.  When they saw he had belonged to a black fraternity at University, they started the investigation.  He received a letter stating he didn't pass because of ""health reasons.""  He got drunk, and when his son came home so proud of himself because he'd given up his space to a black person to go on a University trip.  Dr. Johnston replied,
""What are you so proud of, you're black!""  This is what started the search for his identity.",1378080000,6,1256,4.330472103004292
