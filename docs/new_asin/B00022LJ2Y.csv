8020670,5,B00022LJ2Y,Beautiful. Just wish someone like the Nureyev Foundation would remaster these and provide a clearer recording of these older ballets before they're lost forever.,1453680000,2,161,5.75
8020671,5,B00022LJ2Y,Tone of Nureyev first Sleeping Beauty staging. I just happen to attend that performance in the early 1970s.,1446768000,,107,5.0
8020672,5,B00022LJ2Y,"No one can quite match the magnificent Nureyev!  As others have said, this picture is fuzzy, the sound is mono, and some parts were omitted from other 1972 performances.  But the Bluebird chapters alone are worth the money and the cats are most entertaining.

No recorded media can ever capture the magic of seeing him dance in person.  But, having experienced that magic, one can imagine what this performance really was.

The dvd of the 2000 Paris performance of Nureyev's choreography is also excellent.",1420848000,,506,4.976190476190476

8020675,4,B00022LJ2Y,"I love this ballett and saw it in real life with Nureyev and Tennant. The DVD is not perfect, there are a few sudden stops before it continues. I did not send it back, because It maybe a production fault in all of the DVDs.",1360972800,2,223,3.977777777777778
8020676,5,B00022LJ2Y,"This video is indeed a little lacking in the technical magic for transferring it to video from film, it could have looked crisper on screen, but it's old, so we must cut it a little slack.  There aren't very many DVD's of Nureyev dancing, and this is one you can still acquire.  Besides how great it is to see him in fine form, the whole company dances very well (Frank Augustyn is a terrific Bluebird), the costumes are great, and the set design of the forest is unique, it made me say Oooo when it was lowered to the stage at the end of Act I -- the Evil Spell has been cast, the forest will sleep for 100 years, time will stand still.

You can tell Nureyev had a lot to do with making the production look so good.  It's fortunate that there's a record of this production, so much of dance only exists at the moment of performance, and then it's gone for good.  Nureyev probably danced a hundred Beautys, and we've got only a couple to look at.

The sound was fine on the disk I bought, maybe that customer got a bad disk.",1296172800,4,1024,4.1725888324873095
8020677,1,B00022LJ2Y,"Shame on manufacturer, partly also on Amazon.com!
Remove, eradicate this non-product!!
Poor, very poor sound: MONO, can you believe that???
Poor image quality: one-to-one copying from tape to DVD!!!
And: this isn't the complete 'Sleeping Beauty', as meant by the composer.
I feel cheated!!!!!!
Shame, shame, shame!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(I only filled in one rating star because this strange system doesn't accept zero's!!!!!!!)",1232409600,6,418,5.868852459016393
8020678,1,B00022LJ2Y,"I can understand a few minutes duration of cuts for both ballets & operas, but 50 to 60 minutes worth ? VAI should have labeled this as ""highlights"" of the Sleeping Beauty since its so heavily abridged. And they have the unmitigated audacity to charge full price for this (even Amazon's discounted price does not make this a worthwhile purchase).  Even considering the slight difference in tempos that conductors will take, this ballet should not come in at less than 130 minutes. The Paris Opera complete DVD is 148 minutes, the Royal Ballet is 132, one of the Kirov's is 170 and the Bolshoi version of Grigorivich comes in at 145. I can't fathom why any studio/distributor would think ballet fans would settle for almost an hour of cuts. Did they hedge their bets that Nureyev's presence would suffice ? (This DVD was a gift. While I know from experience to check the 'total running time' on the back of ballet DVDs, someone who has no way of knowing better will take it for what it purports to be: a complete production. I'll do my venting here in this forum; the gift was, of course, very thoughtful LOL).

Besides the ridiculous chop-job, there are other reasons to choose another version. While the Princess Aurora, Veronica Tennant, is a very good dancer, she's too tall and not young enough to pull the role off. And while apparently no expense was spared on the costumes and sets, they  lack color. Aside from a flash of green in the Awakening Scene in Act 2, much of the staging and sets are also colorless. The fairy-tale setting deserves splashes of color.

Until someone underwrites a DVD recording of Pacific Northwest Ballet's staging of Beauty by Ronald & Ann Hynd (with either Louise Nadeau or Noelani Pantastico as Aurora, or even Mara Vinson & Kaori Nakamura), the Sleeping Beautys to have are the Dutch  National Ballet, the Royal Ballet with Viviana Durante, the Paris Opera Ballet with Aurelie Dupont (despite Nureyev's bizarre decision to substitute a pointless solo by the Prince in place of the Lilac Fairy's usual steps in Act 2), and traditional settings by the Kirov & Bolshoi. Don't waste your time or money on this particular production.",1203206400,2,2167,4.768
8020679,5,B00022LJ2Y,"This performance is quite interesting.  First of all, everybody in this dances fantastically.  More to the point, Nureyev does some solos in this that you will not see performed in any other version.  The prologue is full of interesting choreography, and as a result some of the fairy solos are cut.  The bluebird variation is one of the best around in this performance, performed by none other than Karen Kain and Frank Augustyn.  If you are a Nureyev fan(if not, why are you reading this?)and a fan of the Canadian Ballet you will not be disappointed with this dvd.",1129593600,13,567,4.686868686868687
