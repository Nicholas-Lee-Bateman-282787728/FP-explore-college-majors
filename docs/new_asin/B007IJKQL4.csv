8517601,5,B007IJKQL4,"For those piano enthusiasts who desire to hear (and see) something more than the usual pseudo glamorous piano 'dross' that is reflective of our current musical zeitgeist,this document is a must.
A Masterclass in psychological and emotive narrative,it is also a striking reminder of how penetrating and engaging music making could be in a not so distant past.",1358467200,2,358,5.189655172413793
8517602,3,B007IJKQL4,"I'm a big Richter fan, and wanted to see what he looked like while playing.
He keeps mostly motionless and expressionless.
What you will want to know before buying this DVD is that the Soviet video looks like 1960's USA home video technology with washed-out, blurry colors, and constant video ""static"" spots.  Most of time Richter's hands are not shown, just his professionally inert body.
Sound is stereo, but not at all plush.  Constant hiss, but it's steady enough to get used to so you can focus on the emphatic and characterful playing.
These are live one-offs, so there are some real clunker mistakes; not surprising.
There is no printed leaflet, just the DVD.  The first 2/3 (some 80 minutes) are Beethoven sonatas (1, 7, 9, 12) and a Bagatelle, most of which begin with an English subtitle briefly shown at the bottom.  The 2nd program is about 40 minutes of Chopin, each piece starting with a Japanese subtitle!
To conclude, this production is unique, inexpensive, and amateurish.  I'm glad Parnassus issued it (as you will be as long as you know what to expect before purchase) but few viewers will play it often.",1340496000,13,1123,4.768041237113402
