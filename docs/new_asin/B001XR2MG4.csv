8347713,5,B001XR2MG4,"This is a 2-DVD Set. Each DVD lasts 120 minutes,so you have 240 minutes total playing time. Made in Korea in NTSC full-screen format (4:3).About video quality,you cannot expect to see it at high resolution as in a Hollywood-movie dvd,but it's way,way...better than what you see on You Tube. I would say it is like a good VHS-tape quality. It contains most semi-final and final matches of the event. Males and females of all weights (Fin,Fly,Bantam,Feather in Vol. 1;Light,Welter,Middle,Heavy in Vol. 2).
Camera recording & video editing is of professional level with zoom-in/out,different angles,many times scene-repeated...of those moments of tensions,fancy high-jumping kicks,tricky techniques of attacks & counterattacks...etc performed by top-level TKD players of the world from about more than 17 different countries.
  I just wish this box-set should have an extra DVD for opening & ending ceremonies with TKD performances by athletes of the host country (Spain),a brief history of TKD progress in the country... etc.
  I will watch this movie again.",1270944000,,1056,5.5
