1017481,5,6305372594,"I have seen this film praised as some kind of proto-feminist protest against the status of women. On the contrary, Cabiria's suffering is caused by evil people acting in conjunction with her own naivete'. Victimizers do  not thrive without victims, and their mutual, unconscious agreement  energizes and enables their mini-story. Phrases like ""triumph of the  human spirit"" are not accurate. She does not triumph over evil by  refusing to be changed; she is simply too dumb to become cynical - or even  cautious. Triumph would occur if she learned caution, but remained good and  loving. Cabiria is a bigger fool than most people, but one with heart and  goodness. And so we are fond of her; but we need not be fond of her  situation or her folly that brought her to it. Her parting smile at us, the  viewer, assures us that in the end, despite her suffering and loss, all is  well. If I believed that engagement with life was suffering, I could accept  this; but I don't, and can't.  However, as a movie rather than  philosophy, Nights Of Cabiria shines. It expresses its views well, even  poetically. And yes, it is haunting and thought provoking. The Criterion  version is especially good in demonstrating that the restoration, while not  perfect, is very praiseworthy. The dubbing and subtitles were poor, often  not even closely matching one another. The 4th or 5th chapter was not even  dubbed in English. A feature-length commentary would have been a welcome  addition. 5 stars for the movie, 4 for the DVD",946598400,6,1513,4.817120622568093
1017482,5,6305372594,"You'll laugh; you'll cry; you'll want to go to Rome and track down those locations. This regretfully overlooked masterpiece finally gets a  well-deserved restoration and stellar presentation on DVD, and let's hope  it gets more fans in the process.  Giulietta Masina delivers one of the  all-time great screen performances.  And with the long-lost ""man with  a sack"" sequence restored, the movie seems even richer than before.  It's in that sequence that Cabiria sees her future, and the effect is  devastating--for her, and for us at the film's conclusion. And that  conclusion is brilliant--with the slightest teary smile and a nano-second  look into our eyes, Masina tells us volumes about her tragic character and  her spirit for survival--and maybe a little about ourselves, as well. This  is one of those films that has become an annual ritual for me.",942278400,3,857,5.130434782608695

1017484,5,6305372594,"Fellini and his wife, Giulietta Masina have made a masterpiece. The plot at first looks like the standard prostitute-with-the-heart-of-gold. But to describe it in that way would be like saying the Grand Canyon is a large  ditch. What it is really about is a vision of the hope and courage which all  of us know is present in us but which we seldom see. See this film, even if  getting a copy is difficult! You will be rewarded with an experience  transcending the  screen. The last five minutes of the film, where Masina,  in despair after a brutal and degrading attack, walks disconsolate through  sun-dappled fields, and then, looking around at the field, the sun, the air  of life itself, holds up her head and with strenght and courage goes on, is  one of the most vital moments ever put on film. I saw this movie when it  was first made, decades ago, yet it is with me always. Its message  unbelievably beautiful still. ENe",924134400,8,928,4.5636363636363635

1017606,5,6305372594,"One of Fellini's best films. Set in Rome, based upon the trials and tribulations of Cabiria, a poor single young woman in search of love. She's gullible and finds herself in trouble, but somehow she always manages to survive and continue to believe in herself; her spirit is resilient. This is one of the easier plots to follow for a Fellini movie. Giulietta Masina, who plays Cabiria, was Fellini's wife. They married in 1943.

1017607,5,6305372594,"Perhaps the least ""Fellini-esque""  of Fellini's films but also one of his best.  It starts off kind of like a hokey old film about a plucky young prostitute trying to get by in postwar Italy, but it's tightly scripted, and slowly evolves into something with far deeper residence about karma, grace, and perseverance. The lead actress is simply amazing, with a face so expressive, you could probably turn off the sound and subtitles and still follow the film  This features one of the most time-stopping final shots in all of cinema, comparable only with something like Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows"".

1017609,5,6305372594,"Nights of Cabiria, La Dolce Vita, and 8 1/2 are my absolute favorite Fellini films. They are all Exquisite explorations of life they look at human Destiny religion and the routines and ruts that we all fall into and are looking to get out of them. The protagonist in each of these films disillusioned by their own lives, searching for something more. Each turns to organized religion hoping for some sort of Earthly magic but in the end they only find cheap human illusions. These films are timeless reminders that though we may feel alone, we are all searching for our place in the world, each of us hoping from meaning, Uniqueness and happiness. And much like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, the conclusion is always the same. Thu we look for the answers externally our true path to happiness lies within ourselves.

1017653,5,6305372594,"This is the story of a feisty yet innocent single woman in post-war Italy, a prostitute by necessity who believes the next man she meets will be an angel rather than a user. The countryside near Rome is poor, with many people living in caves, ruins and even WWII bomb craters. But through Cabiria we see the Via Veneto, the forests of Rome, ancient historical sites from the time of the Caesars and an Italian movie star. Her love of life, her tenacity, her nerve and her generosity, coupled with her endearing comedic faces and gestures, presents a woman you find hard to forget once you meet her.
Underneath the story line (yes, in spite of other comments here, there is a distinctive story) director Fellini has much to say. What is the purpose of one's life? Is it to become rich, famous and powerful like the actor Lazzari she meets only to find that people only want you for the money? Is it to be committed to the religious life like 'Father' Giovanni? Is it to be awarded the 'prize' of Oscar? The petty thief life of Giorgio?
Each man she meets and becomes attached to finds her charming but that alone doesn't stop them from using her. From our perspective in 2016 we wonder how anyone could honestly be as nave as Cabiria and so often but still retain a faith in humanity after being victimized so frequently. It seems to me that Fellini is saying that, regardless of life's cruelties, its near misses and its frivolous temptations the will to survive is pararmount. This is made all the more evident given the surrounding poverty of Cabiria's postwar world. When she travels along with a pilgrimage to the Madonna and begs for a new life she's disappointed that nothing changes for her. But as Father Giovanni points out, maybe she didn't need any help at all.
Wanda, Cabiria's steady friend throughout the entire movie, is someone most viewers tend to overlook but her loyalty is perhaps one of the strong points in Cabiria's relationship with any character. They argue, laugh, share food and drink, advise each other and stick together through it all. This may be one of the best reasons why Cabiria is so much a survivor. The last scene they share together is a very touching one that only two long and close friends would understand. The men in this movie, with the exception of the cripple's nephew and the mysterious man who feeds and clothes the poor, are ephemeral but Wanda is very real.
I have Italian relatives so I can see a lot of them in Cabiria and the rest of the cast and this may give the review a favorable slant but, if you view this movie not as a normal plot but a character study, I believe you can see the stark beauty in it.",1464048000,5,2661,4.511387163561077

1017750,5,6305372594,"Nights of Cabiria (1957) was the last in what Federico Fellini expert Peter Bondanella calls his `Trilogy of salvation or grace', the other two being La Strada (1954) and Il Bidone (1955). In all three films characters undergo a huge cyclical journey through life where they end up where they started having learned something important on the way. Fellini was ambivalent about organized religion and got into hot water with the Catholic Church on more than one occasion, but the use of the word 'salvation' or `grace' implies some kind of religious program and Fellini is on record as saying Jesus Christ was ""the greatest person in the history of the human race"" and that ""he continues to live on in anyone who sacrifices himself for his neighbor."" Indeed he saw all his early films turn on this idea, especially the ones involving his wife Giulietta Masina - ""a little creature who wants to love and who lives for love."" Please note this is a thematic review and so contains spoilers.

Nights of Cabiria is a transitional work in Fellini's career. It features another picaresque tale of a character who goes on a cyclical emotional journey, but it also looks forward, anticipating much of La dolce vita (1959) in its party scenes and its visit to a religious sanctuary. We briefly met the Roman prostitute Cabiria towards the end of The White Sheik (1952). Fellini combines her with another prostitute whom he met while shooting Il Bidone to make the Cabiria of this film. Cabiria is no clich&eacute;d `tart with a heart' victim. Rather, she is a tough cookie who owns her own house, has a bank account and is fiercely proud of her independence. Unfortunately she has a soft heart and her weakness for love leaves her wide open for exploitation. But we know as hard as she falls, she will always be able to pick herself up and go again. Cabiria is a much more complex character than Gelsomina (and for me even more sympathetic), but Giulietta Masina captures all her contradictions in a wonderfully subtle performance, alternately vivacious and hard-nosed and then vulnerable and adorable to make for one of Fellini's most memorable characters. It is no exaggeration to say that Masina makes this film.

In its narrative structure the film carries on Fellini's obsession in this trilogy with the number 5. Remember Zampan&ograve; repeated his ridiculous strong man act 5 times in La Strada and Augusto performs 5 swindles in the course of Il Bidone. Nights of Cabiria consists of 5 episodes taken out of Cabiria's life which are separated by linking passages of her at her station at the Passeggiata Archeologica in a poor area of Rome. Each episode starts with the promise of hope for escape to a new respectable life, but each one ends in bitter disappointment. The first sees Cabiria in love running by the Tiber with her boyfriend Giorgio in a clich&eacute;d scene of romance, only to have her purse snatched and then pushed into the river by him. A non-swimmer, she almost drowns. The second sees her picked up by a famous movie star (Amedeo Nazzari) outside the Kit Kat Club. She's taken to the Piccadilly Club where we are treated to an exotic echt-La dolce vita floor show before being taken back to the actor's posh casa. Preparing herself for a night of sexual luxuriance, her hopes are dashed by the arrival of the actor's girlfriend and she has to listen to them fornicate all night long from her hiding place inside the bathroom. She gets paid the following morning, but her pride has been wounded, emphasized by her gawky Chaplin-esque dress and her cheap umbrella contrasting with the opulence of the actor's milieu.

The third episode combines two ways that charity can alleviate and perhaps lift poor people out of their deprivation. The Catholic Church didn't like the first way featuring a `man with a sack' journeying around rough areas of Rome dispensing gifts of clothes and food to the needy. Cabiria is fascinated by the man's unexplained generosity and follows him, eventually meeting an old prostitute colleague who is now living in a cave. This could also be Cabiria's fate if she doesn't change her life. Cabiria is driven back to the city center and wants to know the man more, but her shame prevents her. This is quickly followed by a trip to the Divino Amore, a popular sanctuary on Via Ardeatina where it's said the Virgin Mary saved a man from a pack of wild dogs in the 14th century. Cabiria is there together with a group of prostitute colleagues and the crippled father of one of the pimps. They have all come hoping for salvation and a hand-out. Cabiria is at first cynical, but then gets drawn in and is moved by the religious ceremony. The crippled father is sure he has been cured and asks to be released by his helpers, to which he falls flat on his face. Part one of the film ends here. In Italy there would have been an interval and one reason why the Catholic Church had the `man with a sack' sequence removed is that the successful lay charity is contrasted strongly with the `failure' of the charity administered by the Church. In terms of the film however, Cabiria has her hopes raised only to see them dashed again and as she watches a procession of priests walk off she asks them sarcastically if they are looking for snails.

The fourth episode sees Cabiria take in a trademark-Fellini variety show wherein she is put under hypnosis by a magician and reveals unknowingly the vulnerable recesses of her heart - that she wants to marry someone named `Oscar'. Unfortunately for her she also reveals she owns a house and has a bank account. Not knowing what she has said, she is embarrassed when freed of her trance by the laughter of all. Again she is kicked in the teeth. The fifth and last episode is the longest and starts immediately after she leaves the show. A figment from Cabiria's psyche calling himself `Oscar' (Franois P&eacute;rier) introduces himself and begins a long courtship. By now we know the structure of the narrative and simply wait for the inevitable to happen. Eventually Cabiria sells up her house and takes all her money with her to live with Oscar in a village where she has been promised work as a sales clerk. Just like Giorgio at the film's outset Oscar wears sunglasses (Fellini code for untrustworthiness), escorts her to a country place by water and then snatches her bag with everything she has in the entire world. The film has come full circle and Cabiria is broken. And yet all is not lost. In one of Fellini's most famous scenes she is magically caught up in a group of young people dancing and singing down a road. The music is a paraphrase of the music earlier heard at the Divino Amore and as she smiles looking directly at the camera inviting us to join in the procession of life, we know that life goes on and Cabiria will live again. Redemption is received and the procession moves on.

As with La Strada it may seem that religion plays a large part in this film's structure. The visit to the Divino Amore is exceptionally moving and is more than just a dry run for a similar (much more lavish) scene in La dolce vita. Cabiria's need to believe is firmly emphasized and the scene dominates the film, especially with the music returning at the end and the later scene on the road where she meets a priest who urges her to marry and raise children, to live `in God's grace'. She later goes to the monastery to give her confession (such is the law in Italy before anyone marries) and no doubt her search for a way to live `in God's grace' is a possible reading of the film. But also as with La Strada, to reduce the film to just one meaning denies its richness. In any case certain things speak against a Christian interpretation. The contrast between lay charity and Church charity is surely an attack on organized religion (the prior scene has only recently been put back in to the film) and Cabiria's pithy rejoinders to the priests (made very realistic by an Italian script spiced up by street argot researched by Pier Paolo Pasolini for this film) tells its own story. Also, the `redemption' she receives at the end is as uncertain as that received by both Zampan&ograve; and Augusto. In this trilogy the lessons the main characters learn express the secular view of people simply surviving life, of human existence transcending all obstacles with the over-riding theme of love dominating everything. Of course, this love could be both sacred and secular. The name of the sanctuary Cabiria visits (Divino Amore) gives this main theme away and Cabiria's capacity for love constitutes both her main strength and her biggest weakness. Such is the paradox at the center of life and Fellini gives it extraordinary clarity through the incredibly sensitive performance of his wife. This film is less celebrated than La Strada despite picking up awards in Venice and in Hollywood, but it is undoubtedly on the same level. Another Fellini masterpiece, it's one of his 3 or 4 greatest achievements.

Potential buyers should be aware that this film is available in a 3 DVD boxed set from Optimum World/Studio Canal which also includes The White Sheik and La Strada. I picked mine up for just 9 making it an outstanding bargain. The transfer quality of all three films is excellent, pristine b/w pictures and clear sound. Early Fellini is unmissable for lovers of cinema and buying this set is a no-brainer even if you already have La Strada and want to have the other two.",1424649600,5,9456,4.703681351840676

1017869,5,6305372594,"This movie is, in my opinion, his best, slightly better than ""La Strada"". The story of a prostitute, who dreams of a better life has never been told better by this master, and has never been acted better than by the incomparable Guillietta Masina, Fellini's wife in real life. This movie avoids all the clichs of movies like ""Pretty Woman"", and does so by telling a story of a woman alone in Rome, which has its share of gritty night life. If any actress can be miserable and sympathetic at the same time as Guillietta is here, and also in La Strada, I have yet to see one. The scene where she wanders into a late night magic show, and volunteers from the audience is one of the best performances you will ever experience. Fellini wrote this story after interviewing a prostitute, and his sympathy for these women trapped in this life, and directing an  actress of her exceptional talent,  is why this movie is the masterpiece that it is.",1396828800,6,938,4.511764705882353

1017923,5,6305372594,"How did he do it? How did Fellini create such astonishing films?

Small but great works of art are all the movies I've ever seen made by Frederico Fellini, and this one is no exception.

Cabiria, a prostitute who works and lives in incredibly picturesque Italian settings, is a small, rough, but very endearing woman who has some really nasty luck with men.  Her life is a lonely one, her house a one room stone shanty in the bare but still lovely countryside.

Hope springs eternal though, and the movie meanders in a steady, rythemic pace as we follow the life of Caibria, and see her
soul beneath her hard exterior.  This movie never quite develops any plot, or storyline, but, true to all the Fellini movies I've seen, I couldn't take my eyes off the breathtaking settings, which all had a strange eerie quality underlying the beauty.
Fellini tells his stories with his settings, and his characters are props for the true stars of his films, the settings, in the countryside, the dirt roads, the forests, the one room shanties, people wandering through life, getting by, taking life as it comes, with the steady underpinnings of hope, despair, loneliness, and every human emotion, woven like a tapestry throughout.

If you can appreciate a different type of movie, one as an art form, with the best, most artistic cinematography, and can appreciate the way sometimes a movie shot only in black and white can bring a certain feel to the film that color can't, in terms of artistic merit, then you will enjoy this strange, quiet, and oddly moving movie from one of the greatest directors of all time.

I got a sense of the beauty and passion that can fill a movie, even without much plot or story or action, simply by the careful and soulful selection of settings, pacing, filming, and actors.  If you have some sense of artistry in movies,
this is a must see.  The climax is at the end.",1372204800,8,1889,4.631736526946108

It's also one of the greatest films ever made.  What makes this film so transcendent is, of course, the main character Cabiria. Certainly one of the all-time greatest performances, Masina is awe-inspiring.

It's fair to say that no other film creates such a connection between its main character and the audience.  By the time the famous, final seven minutes roll around, we are so utterly in love with Cabiria, and so desperate for her to be happy, that the heartbreak is almost unbearable. If the movie had ended right after this gut wrenching climax, I would have been seething with rage (similar to the way I felt after watching ""La Strada,"" which had all the cruel sorrow but none of the sweet optimism).  Fortunately, Fellini recognized how totally committed and entrenched the audience would be with Cabiria, and he generously (and brilliantly) added a bit of salvation for us.

I can't think of any other film that, in its final minutes, so effortlessly takes the audience from the lowest depth of despair to the highest peak of hope.  One simply cannot forget this movie, this character, and the most emotionally moving/rewarding ending in cinematic history.  I saw this movie twenty years ago, and, to this day, I still desperately want Cabiria to be doing okay.",1326499200,4,1425,4.8879668049792535
1017997,5,6305372594,"Hope and courage? Don't kid yourself! This a bleak film, Fellini's last fling with ""neorealismo"", set primarily in the 'squallide baraccopoli' on the outskirts of post-war Roma, a wasteland of squatters' shacks and ancient ruins furnished as one-room homes for the poor. Not the poorest of the poor, mind you! They live in the grotti, the cave-like excavations even farther from the bright lights of the Via Veneto. The prostitute Cabiria, played by Giulietta Masina (the wife of director Federico Fellini), has saved enough money to buy a shack and to squander some of it on a worthless 'vitellone' boyfriend who tries to drown her for her purse. Cabiria is perhaps the ultimate picaresque heroine, as she thrusts herself unwittingly into bizarre situation after situation, all humiliating and degrading but for her refusal to be humiliated. She's a ""tough cookie"", as my mother would have said, and my mother would have known. They were almost the same age, by which I know that Masina was already thirty-five years old when she starred in the role of Cabiria, a role that earned her the ""Best Actress"" award at the Cannes Festival. This film, ""Nights of Cabiria"", also won the Oscar that year, 1957, for ""best Foreign Film"". But meanwhile, back in the baraccopoli, all of Cabiria's friends and neighbors are loud, vulgar, cynical, brimming with defiant vitality, but somewhat short of kindness or dependability. Most of them, like Cabiria herself, would change their lives in a trice ... if only God or the Virgin mary would grant them a miracle. Since miracles are in short supply, however, most of them have begun to mock the consolations of religion. ""Lasciate ogni speranza, voi chi siete poveri..."" Part of the bleakness of this film is the destitution of Faith that accompanies the destitution of the economy. In one extended painful scene, Cabiria and her prostitute/pimp friends trudge along with a flock of pilgrims to a site where 'healing' is to be prayed for. Cabiria ends up drunk and screaming insults at a band of nuns.

Still, Cabiria has her bright moments of cynical laughter and her tender moments at small favors and gentlenesses. Eventually, after the most excruciating humiliation yet encountered, at the 'hands' of a theatrical hypnotist, she meets Oscar ...

I suppose I'd better not tell you what sort of scamp Oscar turns out to be, lest I spoil your suspense. That he will turn out to be another scamp is obvious from the get-go; the suspense is simply about Cabiria's fate.

All the cinematic artistry of Italian neorealismo is here -- the luscious black-and-white photography, the convincing character acting of non-professional actors, the gritty dark humor, the tangy dialect (Fellini recruited Pier Paolo Pasolini to 'translate' his script into Roman slang) -- combined with the first expression of the extravagant caprice of Fellini's later films. Listen to the sound track and you'll hear the ouverture to La Dolce Vita. But don't be 'conned' by the sly circus ringmaster Fellini. That ""hope and courage"" which some reviewers adore in this film is a bit of flim-flam, a typical Fellini irony, a hollow sacrament of happiness bestowed on those who can't help but be organically happy at moments. It's just a skip and a jump from the final scene of this film, the encounter with the youthful revelers, to the final scene of La Dolce Vita, where the huge dead devil ray is dragged from the surf.

Director Federico Fellini was undoubtedly a film maker genius!
Since his earlier works ""La Strada"" (1954) and ""La Dolce Vita"" (1960) thru ""Fellini Satyricon"" (1969) and ""Amarcord"" (1973) till his lasts ""Ginger and Fred"" (1986) and ""The Voice of the Moon"" (1990) he has left a legacy treasure for film lovers and film makers.
Most of his films combine fantasy and reality in a rich mixture with no fixed boundaries. He displays his own personal conflicts in regard to religious belief; sex and love; youngsters' education; political and religious power; richness and poverty; all this themes and more are shown with a visceral approach.
The viewer will be attracted and repelled alternatively and at the end of each of his movies will go out of the theater (or the bed room or living-room) knowing that he/she has assisted to the show of a unique piece of art.

""The Nights of Cabiria"" (1957) is still a constituent of the Italian ""Neorealist"" film school, showing the poorest neighborhood from Rome and its population of outcasts. The influence of this movement will always emerge in Fellini's movies one way or the other.
Cabiria is a whore striving to survive, at the same time her soul is that of an incurable romantic innocent.
The opening scene shows Cabiria being swindled by her lover. She survives to this harassment and continues living her harsh life.
The whole film is an endearing chronicle of her life, dreams, pains, joys and religious faith, but above all a compassionate regard to all her entourage.

The film was awarded with Foreign Film Oscar and Giulietta Masina with Cannes' Best Actress Award for her anthological performance.
A marvelous film to see!

Even the beggar priest roaming her town was not an ordained one she later found out when she tried give a confession. The reality of post war devastation was all around her outside rome, and her parents early deaths and abandonment she felt caused her to build emotional walls becoming combative and a craving need for validation in all her doomed relationships. IN the beginning of the movie she cannot even thank the people who rescued her from drowning. She argued with her best friend that Georgio, didn't push her into the water as he robbed her, but rather she tripped. She did manage to burn his things and his memory. She didn't want anyone's help even friends. Gradually she opened up in the movie. She started playing ball with fellow prostitutes after visiting a religious icon. She felt free from her pimp Georgio, and had just finished her prayer for a new life.  She met Oscar after a public humiliation at a sheikser hipnotic show.

But as Bazin has explained, it was in this film that Fellini began to work in discreet narrative capsules, each of which has a certain autonomy.  In a sense, in this movie Fellini achieves a perfect balance between abstraction and representation. He also moves beyond the (perhaps dated) sentimentality of ""La Strada"" towards emotion that gains power as it is filtered through tears, laughter, shadow, and light-- and one of cinema's most transcendent endings.

This is the film with which to introduce a viewer to Fellini-- and perhaps to the Art Film in general.",1259798400,3,712,4.9
1018042,5,6305372594,"In the long list of reasons why I love Federico Fellini, `Le Notti di Cabiria' rests very close to the top.  The film is a stunning example of beautifully fleshed out filmmaking, a complete cinematic experience that is a tribute to poignant storytelling and entrancing atmosphere.  Fellini stuns on every frame with his splendid delivery, constructing one of the most enjoyable films to ever contain themes such as attempted murder, thievery and prostitution.

The story is that of street walker Maria Ceccarelli (known as Cabiria) who lives in Rome. Like every girl, Cabiria desires to have a rich and meaningful life filled with love and promise, but her profession truly prevents her from reaching that goal.  Through a series of confrontations, communications and curiosities, Cabiria seems to have found her Prince Charming after all and prepares to leave behind her lurid existence in pursuit of a higher happiness.

But...

Performance-wise, this film is all about one woman; Giulietta Masina.  Her transformative performance (very reminiscent in ways of her stunning `La Strada' performance) is just a revelation.  The way she captures the naivety needed to carry this characterization is just uncanny.  The two characters are very similar, but they are played with a unique individuality.  It is not a mere copycat performance at all.  Masina touches upon rays of desperate hope that I find so appealing and comforting, all the more so capturing the tone intended by her husband (director Fellini).

Such a magical partnership.

Fellini really stretches himself here, fusing a lacy happiness with the apparent devastation that comes from realized deceptions.  The ending is so expected that it actually comes across as a shock, completely taking us by surprise because we simply will it not be so.  His jovial construction also aids to the surprise factor, for the film feels so happy and light that the stark realities add a dark bite to the films atmosphere.

I highly recommend this glorious film.  It is such a standout in the world of cinema; a truly mesmerizing offering from one of the greatest filmmakers to ever grace us with his presence.",1258675200,5,2157,5.117142857142857

The film deals with the trials and tribulations of the impoverished and downtrodden in a humorous but realistic way that Hollywood still does not dare to do. Yet, even in this film, one can see the filmmaker that Fellini was to become in a few years, for, despite its seeming realism, there are many neat touches of Absurdism, Symbolism, and Surrealism.... In many ways, the film is a picaresque of one of the oldest clichs: the hooker with the heart of gold, but such a generalization utterly disservices the `how' of how art affects one, and how it does its task. Masina's brilliant performance, which won the Best Actress award at the Cannes Film Festival, is often compared to Chaplin's tramp character, even though it is more like Lucille Ball's tv character of Lucy Ricardo, from I Love Lucy, albeit with depth, delicacy, and heart; such a depth of a character that a lesser actress would have let descend into burlesque. Yet, Cabiria's expressiveness is more subtle and true than either Chaplin's or Ball's characters, for they exist only in comedies, and Nights Of Cabiria is not a comedy, despite some funny moments. Cabiria exists in a far more complex and realistic world than the Tramp or Lucy Ricardo. Her face contorts into twists of pain Lucy Ricardo never dreamt of, and which the Tramp simply shrugged off, or responded to with wild slapstick. Cabiria is wary, mistrusts, and does not seem to learn, frustrating both her and the audience she has gotten to root for her. I knew many such women in my New York neighborhood while growing up. And they can be tough, street smart, yet still gullible enough to fall for an Oscar. That said, critics have disagreed, over the years, over whether or not Oscar was conning Cabiria from the start. I think it's clear he was, for from her answers to the mesmerist he felt she was an independent woman of means, assuming a poor woman would never even go to such a show. One can even see from their scene of meeting at the train station that Oscar is putting on an act, changing his facial expressions the moment he sees her, dropping a toothpick from his mouth, after looking like the consummate con man, and then assuming a weak demeanor to lure Cabiria into his trap. That the woman who makes her living in sex is still so nave to the ways of emotional sexual involvement says a lot of Fellini's prescience in parsing out realities of character development. Then, when he found out she was a prostitute, he felt a bit guilty, as if preying on someone from his own class, and thus wanted to not know of her `job'. A part of him, it seems, wants to not con her, at the cliff, and this was why his demeanor is so different. Yet, ultimately, he's a con, she's a whore, and reality dictates they act their parts. But, unlike Giorgio, he is no would be killer. The only question is what his initial con was to be- to marry a woman of means, and then, failing that, to just take Cabiria's money the moment he saw it, knowing his original plan was dead, for he could not sponge off of her. Such small ambiguities, even if not pertinent to Cabiria's ultimate unhappiness, nor the film's ending, makes Fellini an artist of the first rank, for only such artists pay attention to such things. These things, not the great things, are often the difference between greats and minor artists.
  These sorts of subtleties in common folk are never even broached, much less dealt with, in modern Hollywood films. Such is the richness of this marvelous study in class and self-deception, where humans live in small concrete boxes they call homes, as if lab rats. That the film does not follow a conventional narrative format is a good thing, for it heightens the realistic sense of the film. It also subtly repudiates religion, although not so much in the overtly religious scenes, where Cabiria's spiritual entreaties go unheard, nor where she mocks the religiots as fools, but in those scenes where Cabiria reveals her most human side, the non-fantastic, which is ironic, since she works in a profession that deals with fantasy. The film also deals with survival, at its basest level, for Cabiria barely grows intellectually through the film. Yes, by film's end, one could argue that her latest user and abuser, Oscar, is a step up from Giorgio, whom she began the film with, but has Cabiria really ameliorated?
  To close, Nights Of Cabiria owes much to City Lights for its focus on the poor, as well as to De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, for its realistic view of life at a certain time and place, especially its end, which simply ends, with no indication of whether or not Cabiria will be better off or not, and this helps viewers more strongly identify with her, because we all are unknowing and uncertain of our futures, and even though Cabiria's uncertainty is half a century removed, the tingle we get in our bellies, at the film's end is a recognition of our fears in her gaze toward us, and despite it's unsettling effect, such butterflies still flap their wings for the future.",1221436800,3,5597,4.684959349593496

Ughh. So when I read the description of Nights of Cabiria, I wasn't keen. But I like Fellini, so decided to give Nights of Cabiria a chance.

This is a wonderful film. Fellini's wife, Giulietta  Masina stars as Cabiria, an older woman who ""lives the life"" in Rome. She lives in Rome's poorest neighborhood, Ostia, but is fiercely proud of being very close to paying off her mortgage. One day she goes with friends to make a pilgrimage to the Virgin Mary and asks for her life to change. Shortly thereafter she meets Oscar and believes the Virgin has blessed her with true love. Like Richard Gere in Pretty Woman, Oscar has his own ideas about how to set Cabiria up for life!

Giulietta Masina is remarkable in this film. She delivers one of the best female performances I've seen in my life. This script is excellent. And Fellini's direction brilliant.

The Criterion restoration of this film is very good-among the best I've seen Criterion produce. The extras, including original previews and shorts from another film with Giulietta playing a much younger prostitute are excellent. Puts ""modern classics"" like Pretty Woman to shame.

This is especially a good film for people to watch who have a lot of pain in their lives, because Cabiria shows us how she got that too, and how she always gets up, dusts herself off and gets back in the game -- nay, joins the parade.

There are many things I love about this film. It tells us so much of the world and Cabiria shows us a glimpse of the Divine coming through the personae. (How fitting that even her name, Cabiria, is a form of a word representing ancient divine deities.)

Falling in love with Cabiria helped me also to fall in love with me.

I would also like to mention how grateful I am that this film is still in black and white. It is true art.

I have called other films my favorite, but in the end -- as of 2008 -- this is THE favorite. (Other contenders are very different though very good, such as TRUE ROMANCE which was written but not directed by Quentin Tarantino.)",1211241600,3,1003,4.071065989847716

1018105,5,6305372594,"Fellini's most powerful films actually PRECEDE the (in my opinion) over-praised '8 1/2' for the simple reason that the heart is more powerful than the head (for me at least).  There are few movies with this kind of enduring emotional appeal - and I must stress this is not cheap, sentimental emotion.  Movies are  products of their time and often age quickly; 'Cabiria' is an extraordinary film experience, but perhaps one must see it twice to fully enter a world created by Fellini a half-century ago.  In any event, most people who enjoy movies are unfamiliar with 'Cabiria', which is stunning to realize after fully experiencing it.

I am almost ashamed to admit that I did not appreciate this movie the first time I saw it (only the second time, and then even more the third time, the fourth, etc....)

Fellini in the 1950's with 'La Strada' and 'Cabiria' created at least two films that will always affect viewers emotionally for one simple reason:  Fellini's ability to explore and ultimately celebrate our humanity within the hell life can often be for many of us.  The power of 'La Strada' is the complex humanity of the two main characters (though Quinn's character only understands how horrible it is emotionally to be fully human in the final minute of the movie; Giulietta Masini's character denies none of her humanity at any point in 'La Strada' and is brutally punished for her inability to edit-out life horrors).

Because 'Cabiria' is now 50 years old it is best watched twice (minimum!)  Only then can one overcome any resistance to how different it is from movies made today.  Only then can one fully appreciate how perfectly melancholy, yearning and integrated the music is by Nino Rota.  More important, what at first may appear to some viewers as mugging and overacting by Masini is revealed as a fully-realized character:  the inimitable Cabiria.

No movie in my experience has a more powerful, hopeful, bittersweet ending than 'Cabiria'; few equal it...

With all great cinematic or theatrical experiences there is always the mystery of how such emotional power is achieved.  Fellini crafted the movie with a talented team of actors and technicians so there should be no mystery.  But the experience of this movie is so powerful that it cannot be put into words.

'8 1/2' is a bon-bon for the intellect.  'Cabiria' is an emotional experience on the highest level.  I know of few movies that equal 'Cabiria' other than 'La Strada'.  These are the best of Fellini's movies, along with the transitional film 'La Dolce Vita'.

So, watch this one (perhaps twice!) and enjoy one of THE great movies...",1205539200,3,2619,4.864559819413093

Anyone who is indulging in a little self-pity over a lousy job or bratty kids should watch this film to get a sense of perspective.

But what makes this character great is that she is either too dumb or too resilient to realize that she has been beaten down by life, and continues to get up off the mat.  Despite a relatively small filmography, Giuletta Masina has to be considered one of the premier actresses of her time, and she keeps the character of Cabiria from becoming a cartoonish ""hooker with a heart of gold.""

Her Cabiria is a spiritual innocent thrust into the least innocent of professions, making her desire for meaningful companionship seem unattainable. Through it all, Masina radiates a plucky dignity that makes us root for her. Note: ""Cabiria"" is more grounded in realism than Fellini's later works, but this hardly detracts from the film's sizable emotional impact.",1182816000,2,547,5.602409638554217
1018111,3,6305372594,"Nights of Cabiria doesn't live up to its formidable reputation but at the same time it doesn't exactly disappoint. Massina is not a good actress by any stretch of the imagination, too overreliant on volume and exaggeration for much of the film, but she is ultimately an affecting one when she stops yeling and just lets her face tell the story. It's Fellini at his most Chaplinesque, with Masina's whore a right little tramp, and its when it harks back to silent cinema that it's at its best. Her boyfriend's sudden change of character at the end seems to come completely out of leftfield and doesn't altogether convince, but it does allow for a truly beautiful final sequence. And it's interesting that of all the things for the Catholic Church to object to about the film, the one that incensed them enough for the sequence to be removed was a man with a sack dispensing blankets and chocolates to derelicts, a touching scene that acts both as a harbinger of Cabiria's probable fate and an affirmation that there is still some good in the world.

Criterion's DVD is a good presentation, boasting the uncut version with the long-deleted 'man with the sack' sequence, interviews with Dominique Delouche and Dino De Laurentiis, an extract from Fellini's The White Sheik where Massina's character made her first brief appearance and the original Italian trailer plus the US reissue trailer.",1181779200,,1388,4.88135593220339

Nothing here has become dated because, like all great art, from Homer to Shakespeare to Tolstoy to Joyce and on and on, this work holds up a mirror to life itself. In fact, as time goes by, this movie becomes more precious. In ""Nights of Cabiria,"" we find ourselves in the society of Rome's pimps and prostitutes as they haunt the evening plying their trade. Cabiria is an independent, refusing to fall under the sway of a pimp. As the film unwinds, almost randomly Cabiria's struggles to stay alive and to find some semblance of decency and sincerity in this inchoate world tumble before us like a dream. From the opening scene, where Cabiria, in thrall to love, is tossed into a river by her boyfriend and robbed of 40,000 lira, to the penultimate scene where again she is shocked into despair, we see the crazy juxtapositioning of eternal hope with bitter reality, exquisite beauty with hideous misery, and the joyful music of humanity with the sad tears of lost love. What resonates so truthfully is how terrible people and life can be but how ever-resilient and relentlessly hopeful the human heart remains. This true spiritual message is delivered even as these ""sinners"" search for a miracle from the Virgin Mary but find nothing but their own futile yearnings for a better life. Fellini, the creator, saw it all.

Giulietta Masina delivers an utterly brilliant performance as Cabiria. She embodies Cabiria's comic bravado and loving soul while at the same time giving full expression to her cynicism and despair. This performance is one of the greatest you will ever see on film. So many emotions pass through her in flashes and bursts that it is a wonder to behold. The extra features on the Criterion DVD permit the viewer to have a deeper understanding of Fellini's creative process, although a long interview with Dominique Delouche, Fellini's French assistant, is not as enlightening as I would have liked, nor is the sequence with Dino De Laurentiis. However, it's terrific to watch an excerpt from ""The White Sheik,"" Fellini's first major movie (a flop), where Masina makes a brief appearance as Cabiria in a night-time sequence and, with another prostitute, attempts to comfort a jilted husband. Masina was wonderfully physical as an actress and does a lovely little dance in this scene. Her dancing in this movie too is fantastically comic and joyful, a lovely thing to behold.

No question that this movie will endure as long as there are people who are moved by true art. Its message is eternal, its vision rejuvenating.",1171670400,4,2754,4.869936034115138
1018159,5,6305372594,"NIGHTS OF CABIRIA was my introduction to the fims of director Federico Fellini.  This film about the adverse life of a Roman streetwalker, Maria ""Cabiria"" Ceccerelli (played by Fellini's wife, the great Italian actress Giulietta Masina) and her indomitable spirit is both beautiful and absolutely heartbreaking.  From the very beginning, the life of Cabiria is seriously being tested.  She narrowly escapes a fatal drowning and is rescued by a group of kids.  Cabiria is told that she is ""like a cat"" and has ""eight lives"" (she just lost the ninth one when she almost drowned). Though, Cabiria has a less than wholesome professon, she is a woman of high moral character.  She owns her own home and really wants to meet a man for whom she can share a life with.  Unfortunately, the men she encounters continue to mistreat and deceive her.  Whether it is Alberto Lazzari (Amedeo Nazzari), a film star who fills her head with empty promises, or Oscar D'Onofrio (Francois Perier), with whom she has a chance encounter at a magic show.

Giulietta Massina is simply marvelous here.  She has a beautiful and expressive face and those wonderful eyebrows, that look as if they had been painted right on her forehead.  There are moments of sheer bliss when Cabiria thinks she has found ""the one,"" followed by the bleak reality of her encounters.  We, as the audience, cannot help but fall in love with her, and want for her nothing but the best....truly a film that embodies the resilience of the human spirit, in the face of adversity, pain and disappointment.  A gem......",1171670400,10,1564,4.838345864661654
1018160,5,6305372594,"First of all this is a masterpiece, maybe Fellini's best film.

Second, 'Cabiria' is a very spiritual, soul-searching, heart-rending film. A religious film, in the best sense. It's the story of a prostitute in Rome, a good-natured woman with a heart bigger than all the evil in Rome. Cabiria wants to esape from her sordid and sad life because her soul is in a searching state (""search and you will find""); she hints that there's more in the world than sordidness and evil. She finds in her wanderings two human examples of what she wants thirsts for. A charitable saint, a Christ-like figure, pure, anonymous, mysterious; his brief appearance in the film awakens in her that spiritual fulfillment that she longs for. A second personage is a little monk who addresses her tenderly. He is full of the grace of God and asks her if  she is also in the grace of God. No, she says sadly. Then she will find religion in its worst shape: catholic idolatry of the Madonna and the saints. She comes out of this experience feeling exploited, cheated. But her search for the love of God in her life does not end at all: for she is one of the elected; the Lord, the only living One who has what she wants has already chosen her for salvation. The film may end in another disappointment but we know -seeing her irrepresible smile- that she will eventually find the Lord's grace.

Of course non-believers will interpret this film many other ways, even to the point of flipping the message over, and seeing atheism as the solution to Cabiria's disappointments in life, or blaming society's unequalities and injustices for her unfulfilled dreams of ""social"" bliss. That is why there will never -and can never- be reconciliation between good and evil, between Light and darkness, and we end up living among sons of God and sons of the Devil, between  those who choose evil and those who are chosen by God to have life, and have it abundantly.

In 'La Dolce Vita' there was a strong presence of spiritualism. In 'Cabiria' it is the only motive present. Massina's character is overwhelmingly present to the detriment of any other subplots or characters. She would have made a wonderful Mary Magdalene, because she is the kind of soul that Jesus used to purify and bless.

In the booklet included here Fellini comments that he took Cabiria's character from Chaplin's movies. This is patent all over the film, and makes it a great movie. Other directors would have told us a melodrama, a neo-realistic piece a la Visconti. But Fellini -and this is the great talent in Fellini- does not present us so much with facts that call for consequences, as he presents states of soul: the unexplainable qualities of the human soul to which we can only admire with awe and respect, and where no social argument is called for.",1170028800,4,2793,4.689795918367347

Of all his characters, Fellini once said, Cabiria was the only one he was still worried about. Of all the characters, I've seen in the films, Cabiria is the one I often think about - what ever happened to her? Did she survive? Was she able to find love?

I've never seen the face so alive, changing its expression every moment. If the face is the soul's mirror, Cabiria's (Masina's) face reflects her every single emotion and how effortlessly she goes from bitter cynicism to wistful yearning, from despair to hope, from tears to smile.

Fellini makes and admirable tour de force portrait around the religious beliefs, the circus in which magic and illusion will shake hands. Cabiria still maintains her personal faith in love, friendship and honesty in a dark, somber and greed environment, struck by the fatalities of war.

I think that this is Fellini's best.",1109030400,5,881,4.827814569536423
1018236,5,6305372594,"I love Federico Fellini, but I dread his early works like La Strada because they are so sad.  Poor Giulietta Masina, one of the greatest film actresses of all time, she always gets the short end of the stick and because the movie magic is so intense, our heart breaks right along with her.

Fellini is the Great Director Italian style.  I don't mean he isn't the greatest director, better than Hitchcock, Welles, a modern like Scorcese.  I'm looking at his work, have seen most of them, and I can't make up my mind.  He might be the greatest that ever lived.  His films in black and white, the Neo-Realism of Italian film after the war, the incredible original vision, the writing, and directing, it's as though Michelangelo came back as a director.

Masina is a prostitute, but her loves turn out to be pocketbook grabbers.  Her physical well being is not high on her boyfriend's priority list. She's such a little women, frail, and in Nights she plays a tough, brawling, whimsical, and hopeless romantic.  Her acting style is over the top, almost carnival character as she had played it in La Strada, but as Cabiria, she's older, but not necessarily wiser.  The final revelation with French actor Franois P&eacute;rier is so heart rendering because after an hour and a half of Cabiria's, laughter, trials, and disappointments, we identify with her completely.  And then, in one last scene, the carnival returns with hope.

There is so much more to say about this film.  You could write a book.",1108944000,23,1495,4.725868725868726

This film tore me apart the first time I saw it (at the Quad Cinema on 12th Street in Manhattan, alone on a rainy afternoon sometime in the mid-90s) and subsequent viewings did subsequently tear me to shreds. It instills the most beautiful kind of melancholy; never has a film had such a tragic and uplifting ending. Cabiria is a model of blind hope, so rare in the human spirit.

1018239,4,6305372594,"Writer/director Federico Fellini's film follows the life of a prostitute (Giulietta Masina) whose tough exterior conceals a soul that is longing to surrender itself to someone that she can love and trust.  Unfortunately, her occupation doesn't present her with many likely candidates, and the men she gives her heart to inevitably betray her.  She bounces back sad, angry, bitter, but also resilient and determined to forge ahead.  We know that she will give her heart away again and again, no matter how badly she is hurt, and we can only hope that the next man will treat her as she deserves.

This film really needs an actress of Masina's ability to make it succeed.  It meanders along, following Cabiria from situation to situation, and not all of it held my attention.  I sometimes found myself growing bored, only to be confronted with a riveting scene such as the sequence at the hypnotist's show, where Cabiria is cruelly manipulated into revealing her vulnerability on stage before a rowdy crowd, setting her up for yet more tragedy.

1018240,3,6305372594,"""La Notti Di Cabriria"" is a fine showcase for the goofball charm of Giulietta Masina. I have no doubt that it has reduced many a mighty soul to tears and trembling. The story is tight and conveyed with authority and conviction.  I am certain that this is a ""good"" movie that most people enjoy thoroughly.  I'm going to back and watch it again, but as it stands, it just didn't move me like I expected it to.  I can't very well give it a higher rating until it impacts me emotionally.
Still, I recognize that the film has an exceedingly dirty feel to it. Everything from Cabriria's occupation to the  filthy beggars crying out for Grace from Maria --reek with a pestilence that cannot be washed off. The film is ugly--and Cabriria is presented like a little beacon of light to guide the viewer through the stinking pit of civilization.  Masina does a fine job conveying the sufferings and triumphs of her character. I'm just not a big fan of these types of stories--I watched it because it is a Fellini film and I am trying to work my way through all his work.  I will watch this again after I've made more of a dent in his output. I'll probably see it in an entirely different way and perhaps may even like it more.
Ultimately, if you love rooting for the little gal, this film is for you.  She is very much like Chaplin's ""little tramp"" and you will enjoy observing her gritty determination to climb every mountain with a song in her heart.

The DVD includes the ""Man with the Sack"" sequence that producer Dino de Laurentiis (more recently the production powerhouse behind the Hannibal Lecter franchise) excised from the original release. One can understand why a producer would want to trim it out - but its inclusion here makes the film seem larger somehow and Criterion should be applauded for putting it back in.

1018242,5,6305372594,"""Le Notti di Cabiria"", Federico Fellini's 1957 Academy Award winning film, is a poignant, touching and timeless work of Italian cinema.  The film details the life of Cabiria (played by Fellini's wife Giulietta Masina), a ""night bird"" who leads a cynical life of prostitution on the streets of Rome.  Throughout the film, Fellini guides us through her search for true love, refuge, and eventual salvation.  Her poetic story is one of sadness, hope, and the unending search for a true place to call home.  Giulietta Masina's brilliant performance draws her audience into her ravaged world and leaves them forever changed.
 Cabiria has been a prostitute since her youngest days - she recollects entering the streets at 15 with ""long, dark hair"", unaware of what she was getting into.  As we learn in the opening scene, she has been consistently taken advantage of by men, yet attempts to walk a fine line between clinging to them in a search for true happiness and remaining ever independent and self-sufficient.  As soon as the film opens, she is robbed by her pimp, and later spends the night with a self-consumed wealthy director.  However, the director throws her in the closet as soon as his girlfriend arrives and in the morning quickly escorts a sad Cabiria out of the house, with all her hopes crushed.  During the film Cabiria is frequently enticed by the promise of a new life in her encounters, yet consistently meets impending doom.
 The most heartbreaking theme of the film is Cabiria's hopeless search for happiness and salvation.  We see that her friends in the business are no better off - Cabiria's story is a universal account.  She is cynical and cold only because of the tragedy she has suffered when she has chosen to share herself.  However, she makes a gradual transformation throughout the film as soon as she meets D'onofrio - a handsome, intelligent and caring man who finds Cabiria at a comedy show.  Cabiria is at first doubtful and aloof around him, but as the story progresses becomes more open and loving.  She has finally found the answer in D'onofrio; she proceeds to sell her house and gather her life savings to live the married life as her mother had with D'onofrio.  In the end of the film, her hopes are once again crushed as Fellini brings us to a cliff overlooking a river, the same setting as the opening scene in which Cabiria was robbed by her pimp and thrown into the river.  Cabiria recognizes why D'onofrio has taken her there, breaks down crying and asks for him to throw her over the cliff.  D'onofrio takes her life savings and leaves her on the cliff to her sorrows.  Fellini ends the film with a shot of Cabiria looking into the camera smiling through her tears - she still has some hope for humanity inside her.
 It seems that no matter how desperate her struggles, Cabiria can not leave her life on the streets.  She tells D'onofrio that as a teenager she and her friend Wanda had tried to escape the streets through starting a newspaper stand and could never get it off the ground.  Perhaps it is something about Cabiria that keeps her working on the streets, perhaps it is her eternal hope in the goodness of mankind.  She will never stop believing someone good is waiting for her out in the obscurity of the night.  While at a holy site where Mary was to have appeared, she begs in tears for Mary to change her life.  Her prayers, expectedly, are not answered.  In ""Le Notti di Cabiria"", Fellini breaks our hearts through Giulietta Masina's brilliant portrayal of an infinite search for love amongst a dark world ravaged with deceit and pain.",1070064000,8,3595,4.702875399361022

1018284,5,6305372594,"Giulietta Masina has often been compared to Charlie Chaplin, but I tend to favor the argument that she is like an Italian neo-realist Lucille Ball.  All you have to do is watch the scene when the tiny Cabiria is dancing the nightclub, kicking her legs up and smiling away to feel the energy and comic timing that the late Ball put into her various Lucy characters.

Nights of Cabiria is truly one of Fellini's best films.  It's touching and humorous and beautifully acted.  If some of the scenes look familiar, it's because they were done almost shot-for-shot in the American musical remake, ""Sweet Charity."" However, ""Nights of Cabiria"" is a much better film than Charity ever was.  As much as I like Shirley MacLaine, she really doesn't caputure the essence of the small, plucky prostitute like Masina does.  MacLaine plays Charity like a slightly retarded shrinking violet, whereas Masina is small but tough.  Just look at the scene when she walks between the two much taller prostitutes and has a look on her face just daring them to say anything.  Masina is brilliant in her role. If Cheri Oteri proved herself as a dramatic actress, she'd probably be the best choice to play Cabiria nowadays in a remake.

One of the most moving sequences in the film is the one that caused so much controversy and was cut out of the film for almost 40 years: the man with the sack sequence.  In it, Cabiria faces what may become of her in the future and it's a sober reality.  This is one of the best moments onscreen, but is outmatched by the famous ending shot when Cabiria stares at the audience, smiling through her tears.

Definitely worth the rental.",1050883200,5,1646,4.657439446366782

However, the ending is not entirely satisfactory.  It reflects Fellini's then-belief in ""neorealism"".  And, like many neo-realistic films, it won't make you feel good.  Which is why I see this as a brilliant warm-up exercise to ""La Dolce Vita"", which explores some of the same themes.

Aside from Giulietta Masina, there are many other reasons to see this movie. The parade of improbable faces, the opulent locations in and around Rome, the wonderful variety of music, and the amazingingly artistic quality of every shot that Fellini directs.

1018293,5,6305372594,"A prostitute whose life is a veritable study in the resilience of the human spirit is the subject of ""Nights of Cabiria,"" directed by Federico Fellini.  Giulietta Masina stars as Cabiria, a gentle soul at heart who manages to maintain a positive outlook even in the face of adversity.  Experiences that would leave those of lesser mettle jaded she is seemingly able to ward off and emerge from intact, with a guarded optimism that nevertheless leaves her open to whatever ills life may have in store for her next.  But it is just that optimism and her sense of joy in the simple things that makes her so endearing.  She is proud, for example, of the fact that she owns her own house, hovel though it may be.  Though not one to be easily duped, she is vulnerable to sincere persistence, which has in the past rendered her victim to those who would take advantage of her, which is succinctly established in the opening scene of the film.  Fellini's film is a study of how good may succumb to evil, and yet still triumph in the end (though open to subjective interpretation).  It's something of an examination of endurance; how many times can one be knocked down before finally being unable to stand back up again.  At the same time, however, it's an example of how purity can prevail against even the utmost cruelty.  There is a humanity manifested in Cabiria that somehow gives absolution, not only to her lifestyle, but to those who would willingly do her harm.  And it is in that very same absolution that we find a message of hope and redemption.  As Cabiria, the diminutive Masina gives a performance that is nothing less than superlative, filled with nuance and expression.  She has a face and a manner that convey an unbelievable depth of emotion, and Fellini captures every bit of it with his camera to perfection.  It sometimes seems that she is a sprite merely masquerading as a woman; she has a light, almost ethereal presence, though at the same time she exhibits an earthy quality that gives her character such complexity, which removes any semblance of stereotype one may assign to her character as a ""lady of the evening.""  It is a heartfelt, memorable portrayal that quite simply should have earned her an Oscar for Best Actress.  Turning in a noteworthy performance, also, is Francois Perier, as Oscar D'Onofrio, the stranger who comes into Cabiria's life with an offer that ultimately seems too good to be true.  The supporting cast includes Amedeo Nazzari (Alberto Lazzari), Aldo Silvani (The Hypnotist), Franca Marzi (Wanda), Dorian Gray (Jessy), Mario Passante (Cripple in the ""Miracle"" sequence), Pina Gualandri (Matilda), Leo Cattozzo (Man with the sack) and Polidor (The Monk).  ""Nights of Cabiria"" is a film of extraordinary depth that is beautiful as well in it's humanity; Fellini has created images, both visually and emotionally, that are stunning and indelibly realized.  Highlighted by the performance of Giulietta Masina, this is a film that begs to be embraced, one that will stay with you long after the last shadow has passed from the screen into darkness.  In Cabiria, Fellini somehow touches something eternal, for there is a lasting sense of innate goodness about her that simply cannot be forgotten.

1018343,5,6305372594,"i hesitate to call giuletta masina's performance one of the best comedic displays i've ever seen: no, not because it isn't good enough, but because i fear it's too limiting. she's certainly very funny, but the role of cabiria, the ""night walker"" who's looking for true love, demands a performance that is both hilarious and poignant, one that makes you laugh until you cry and then makes you cry until you can't anymore.
masina reminds me of an italian lucille ball, except good ol' lucy never lit up the big screen quite the same way. like her character in la strada, masina seems to be always attracted to loutish figures, beginning with giorgio, a beau who steals her purse and then pushes her into a lake. he's followed by alberto lazzati, a fading star, who picks her up for the night and seems genuine in his interest until his girlfriend pays him a visit and cabiria spends the night locked in the bathroom.
cabiria strikes you as someone who never really wanted to get into the ""business,"" but ended up falling into it anyway. she desperately seems to want out of it, to find a good man to lead her out of it, to give herself over to religion, but both of these avenues fail. one fateful night at a hypnotist's show changes all of that, though. a fling with a man she meets after the show seems like it could be real love...but is it? the ending is incredibly emotional and the final two minutes of the film serve as a haunting conclusion to masina's masterful performance.
the film is very much what we'd expect from fellini, even though it is from his early period. many of his trademarks on are on parade here: the spectacle, the religious imagery, and the whole ethos of life as one big carnival. his direction is fluid and artful: the images he captures are quite amazing and the restoration process lets you see all of them in their full glory; rome remains, as ever, an incredible place to film. what does set this apart from his later works is the naivity of it: whereas his later films give off a cosmopolitan air, there is something just downright provincial about nights of cabiria.
cabiria, i believe, is an underrated film: it certainly deserves to be right up there in fellini's canon and it's definitely a better film than the overlong la dolce vita. cabiria is about faith and hope in the face of all odds, it's a tribute to the human spirit. above all, though, i believe it's a tribute to the director's wife, masina. he captures her with the eye of a loving husband and, thankfully, he also captured her for the whole world to see.",976838400,9,2557,4.524838012958964

The plot, at first glance a rather  dull, depressing subject, is livened by Fellini's inspired use of humour.  The neo-realist style is enhanced by the dialogue, co-written by the  controversial Italian film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini (Salo, Accatone), and  newly translated here. Considering the film's age (and a sequence of the  film was lost) the picture quality is quite stunning.  The sound shows its  age far more, but is perfectly audible and acceptable.  The extras are a  welcome addition, the original and re-release trailers, a couple of  informative interviews, and an extract from the White Sheik (although this  is of rather poor quality, it still makes for an interesting  addition).

Watch carefully, for the first two minutes of the opening scene represent the unfortunate recurring pattern of Cabiria's life: sheer happiness followed  by tearful sorrow.  Fellini's masterful approach to the story of Cabiria, a  plain-Jane older prostitute in 1950's Rome, is not only artful but  insightful.  Surprisingly, you love this character from the moment you meet  her and you can't help but wish her the best.  You personally share in her  disappointments, some greater than others, and Cabiria displays a  remarkable level of resilience in the face of it all.  Just when you start  thinking that things may be going well for her, BOOM!, Fellini drops the  bomb that blows everything to bits.  The ending is one of such  heartbreaking sadness that, I guarantee, will stay with you forever.  Even  weeks after first seeing this film, dear Cabiria is still on my mind and I  wonder every so often what happened to her after the movie ended.
From  a technical aspect, the Criterion release is outstanding.  The visual  restoration of this film is unbelievable.  There is a feature that shows  how the film was restored, and it's fascinating to see how the print went  from dark and almost impossible to see to clear and bright.  The subtitles  have been newly translated to a more modern English.  There is an optional  English-dubbed soundtrack which is helpful for some scenes where there is  lots of quick-fire dialog in which the subtitles have been pared down for  clarity.  There is also a video interview with Fellini's assistant  Dominique Delouche, as well as an audio interview with Dino de Laurentiis.  This newly-mastered print has a formerly missing segment titled ""man  with a sack"" which, depending on which interviewee you believe, was  deleted due to pressure from the Roman Catholic Church (Delouche) or for  the sake of timing and continuity (de Laurentiis).  My only problem with  the restoration is that the sound, remastered from the original 1957  negative, is sometimes harsh and tinny.  But, that's minor and easily  forgiveable when compared to the beautiful visual restoration.

Check out the DVD extras for comparisons.  I can't stop  thinking about this lady and what must drive her.",959990400,,422,4.845070422535211
1018349,5,6305372594,"One of the bonus features that you will find in this DVD is a very instructive interview of the assistant of Federico Fellini for NIGHTS OF CABIRIA. At a certain moment, in order to qualify Fellini's work, he uses  the terms "" poetic density "" . That's exactly what one feels  while watching the movies of the italian director during his first period  of creativity.
The search for happiness of Cabiria, the prostitute with a  big heart, is one of the most moving story you will ever see. It is going  to touch you deep inside, where it really hurts, where the scars always  bleed. Because you and me, for a second or for a day, we have already felt  the despair of Cabiria in our very heart.
It must be noted that the copy  presented by Criterion includes "" The Man with the Sack ""  sequence which has been invisible for years. At last, no need to say that  sound and images are, as always in this collection, perfect.
A DVD for  your library.",956620800,2,944,4.337142857142857
1018350,5,6305372594,"After renting this film a few weeks ago,I've never really been much of a Fellini fan. I've seen most of his major films such as ""La Strada"" or ""La Dolce Vita"". But his films never moved me in  any special way. I've always perceived his films to be extremely odd as in  the case of ""Satyricon"" or ""City of Women"". Up untill  the point when I saw this film, my favorite was ""The White Sheik""  which I felt was his best work,mostly because it was ""normal"".  But with this movie Fellini shocked me! I actually felt sorry for Masina's  character. And on top of that I wanted a happy ending. For once Fellini  made a movie that actually moved me. Now I am a Fellini fan forever!",955756800,2,672,4.244094488188976
1018351,5,6305372594,You will not be disappointed with this wonderful film.  A wonderful story handled by a real master.  It magically mixes tragedy with the wonderful humor Giulietta Masina gives her character Cabiria. Cabiria is one of the  most unforgettable characters in cinema. It also perfectly captures what  life may have been like for these young hipster er... prostitutes in 50's  Italy.  Put off seeing the latest Hollywood release just once and see this  wonderful work instead.,955497600,,470,5.1866666666666665

7888541,5,6305372594,"Like a lot of Fellini, it's sort of an episodic soup of delightful scenarios. Giulietta Masina is fabulous in this. Funny and empathetic, but mostly funny. Something slight in her expression. That smirk of hers. I think its a sort of bluster that conceals self-consciousness. La Dolce Vita has richer imagery but it lacks Ms. Masina's transcendent charm.",1519689600,,354,5.120689655172414
7888542,4,6305372594,"Id seen this move a few yrs. ago on TCM. You care immediately for the titular character from the very beginning, and so much more, by the films end; I also ordered La Dolce Vita prior to Cabiria, and will likely order additional titles directed by Federico Fellini. The ever optimistic Cabiria endures abuses that infuriate you, but her resiliency is the heroine of the movie; definitely worth catching up on, if you're exploring foreign films for the first time.",1518393600,,463,4.8
7888543,5,6305372594,"A classic example of Federico Fellini's cinematic work, starring his wife and muse Giulietta Masina, in which he explores familiar themes of celebrity, class, religion, etc. The story focuses on the picaresque and tragicomic adventures of a tough but childlike and innocent Roman prostitute named ""Cabiriria."" Although the men in her life break her heart and take advantage of her naivet&eacute;, ultimately she finds a form of bittersweet redemption and is able to ""be in the grace of God,"" as described by a happy-go-lucky vagabond priest named Father Giovanni, whom she meets walking along the road to Ostia.",1515542400,,611,5.244897959183674
