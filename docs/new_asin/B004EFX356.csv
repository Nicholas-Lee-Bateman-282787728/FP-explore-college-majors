4337033,4,B004EFX356,"I follow the Tone it Up girls on Youtube and am a member of their diet/lifestyle plan. I love their enthusiam and the way they present their workouts to their viewers. I find most workout DVDs boring and it's hard for me to motivate myself to workout at home, but their Youtube workous keep me engaged and interested. This DVD is comparable to their Youtube videos. I like it because it's a longer version than their Youtube workouts, it's a full body workout. It's done in circuits and each circuit is repeated. I think there are 6 circuits. They spend about 20 minutes doing upper body/lower body and 20 minutes doing abs/glutes. I would say I'm in fairly good shape and the first time I tried this DVD, I could only get halfway through. I can follow the DVD more closely now, but still can do as many reps as they do. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because at times it seemed really unfinished or unrehearsed. Sometimes one girl would start with the right leg/arm and the other would start on the left. Or one would use a weight and the other wouldn't. Anytime this happens, both girls seem surprised and confused by the other one. I wish they would've gone back and edited to make things go more smoothly. Overall though, I think it is a good buy.",1327017600,10,1256,4.418103448275862
4337034,2,B004EFX356,"I bought this dvd based on the fact that it affiliated with the great jane fonda. However it is so boring, i bearly went through it once and shall not do it again. The hosts might be good trainers in a gym, however they do. Ot hve any idea how to be on a video. The routine is not homogenous and there is almost no music. There are definitely better options out there.",1318118400,7,368,4.054794520547945
4337035,5,B004EFX356,"I love K&K!!!
I am on the Tone It Up Team and the diet plan by K&K. This workout DVD is everything you expect from K&K if you know them and have been following their YouTube channel.
I would buy it over and over again!",1310342400,4,218,3.8666666666666667
4337036,5,B004EFX356,"This video is approximately 45 minutes long.  There are about 5-6 circuits (4 moves each) and they are repeated 2x so there is no boredom.  Each of the ciruits have compound moves so you are working upper and lower at the same time.  There are some really unique moves in this video.  It is challenging and gets your heartrate up, but there is no dread factor.  I really like their their teaching style.  A good add to your workout rotation.",1304899200,17,441,4.45
4337037,5,B004EFX356,"I have several Jane Fonda's workouts, and I was curious about the new ones, and they have not disappointed me at all; Katrina and Karena introduces us a workout in which you work every part of your body and get sweat in less than an hour, I love that.",1299110400,3,251,4.142857142857143
4337038,5,B004EFX356,I totally love this workout. It's a bit different from what I'm used to because I've been a total Firm DVD addict for years now and wouldn't really buy anyone else's workouts until now. I love Karena & Katrina! They are an awesome team and the workout is pretty tough. It does get your heart rate up and gets you to sculpting that body of yours.,1297814400,7,345,4.242424242424242
4337039,5,B004EFX356,"I kinda just stumbled across their You Tube videos last summer, and I have been hooked ever since! They are awesome, and this dvd fantastic! It works you our from head to toe, with tons of combination moves so that you are maximizing your time. Plus you will know that you have worked out afterwards. Their One Day Fat Blast DVD is also incredible!

Lovin Tone It Up! :)

PS Check out their fat burning diet plan at their website...it is super approachable and solid as far as nutrition goes!",1294704000,14,492,4.455555555555556

8426881,5,B004EFX356,I love this video it was exactly what I was looking for. I'm a very thin person just looking for a way to tone. I love it!,1427068800,,122,3.5555555555555554
8426882,5,B004EFX356,"Karena and Katrina are two of my favorite fitness instructors of all time. I had to buy this workout DVD because I'm such a big fan of theirs. Having two fun, beautiful, upbeat instructors leading the workout really makes a huge difference. It's more enjoyable and energetic this way. One of my best friends exposed me to Karena and Katrina in September 2012; she knew what she was doing. Karena and Katrina are best friends, too. I hope to own every workout that Karena and Katrina make together.

The girls alternate as instructors and demonstrators. One demonstrates an exercise while the other one instructs. You will need a set of weights to do this workout. It's 45 minutes long and you will feel good once you're done. I have and I did it just today.",1422835200,2,757,4.607407407407408
8426883,5,B004EFX356,"This workout video is incredible! It's 45 minutes of working the whole entire body. Anyone from a beginner to an intermediate fitness fan will benefit. I learned some new moves that left my muscles sore for days after. I was able to follow along with about 90% of the fitness moves Karena and Katrina demonstrated. Shipping was incredibly fast, received the DVD with two days.",1420675200,,376,4.8
8426884,3,B004EFX356,"I didn't read the description close enough.  It wasn't what I thought it would be.  Pretty much, meh.",1410739200,,101,4.555555555555555
8426885,5,B004EFX356,"I love Katrian and Karena but i think their workouts videos are kind of expensive so i decided to buy this one and also ""One day fat blast"". I love the work outs i do them before i do cardio and i definitely see a difference. I have been doing both of the workout videos for 5 days with cardio and eating healthy and I have lost 3 pounds. I really recommend this if you cant afford the $30 of DVD they offer. This are great and they are very fun and they explain every move they do which i like because i feel like it will benefit me.",1393977600,2,534,3.908256880733945
8426886,5,B004EFX356,This is such a nice routine by K & K. It is done at a slightly slower pace than their usual workouts and a bit more controlled and not as intense as their One Day Fat Blast. I really love this routine and it showcases all of their signature moves. It is a full body toning routine with a nice cardio effect too.,1393027200,,311,3.9523809523809526
8426887,1,B004EFX356,thought this was a waste of time. I could do without her political stances and views and disrespect of veterans.,1365811200,2,112,4.65
8426888,5,B004EFX356,"These girls are the best so modivational and inspirational! Not only do their DVDs rock ,but their blog is great too! Tone it up.com! Check out this DVD if you like it check out all if them. There are some spots that are not perfect in the DVD, but who is perfect? You can tell they have to work hard too!",1338163200,5,305,4.016393442622951
8426889,2,B004EFX356,"I was hoping this DVD would be worthwhile because Jane Fonda has always produced good workouts. Unfortunately, I was wrong.  Katrina and Karen are amateur personal trainers (at best). I am not even sure Katrina and Karen completed a practice session before filming the DVD. The actually workout itself isn't terrible, if you can get past the actors' performance of the exercises.  I am really surprised Jane Fonda would put her name on this video. If you are looking for a serious workout with a professional trainer check out Kelly Coffey-Meyer 30-minutes to fitness programs.",1330732800,11,577,5.063157894736842
