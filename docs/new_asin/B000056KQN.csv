1397778,4,B000056KQN,"I was stunned by how close the language of Gordon Gekko is to the rhetoric of the UK Government. In Gekkos speech to the stockholders of Teldar Paper he tells them about the bureaucrats who are messing you around if I can paraphrase and I cant figure out what these guys do! are almost the exact words Nigel Farage accosted a European Executive with. Now Farage advises Trump. Trump the spoiler.

Watching this blu ray now I can see the evolution of language on the political stage. Truth is for wimps. What is said has no penalty for being the opposite of what is done. And we are Bud; the wide-eyed youth smelling wealth. Caught in the Headlines. Desperate illusions.

Our Media love the rhetoric of challenge and change and difference. The Conservative Party serve it all up to them. Gekko style. Greed is never spoken. As good as it is. Make no mistake the UK National Health Service WILL be privatised. Piece by piece, stealth and confound with opposite presentation. Saving the UK. In Wall Street Gekko espouses saving the USA with his greed is evolution spiel.

Greed is an Independent UK. Doomed to suffer from the fixation the very, very few have with total Power. The European parliament and its laws were/are walking all over them. Always play to your weakness. Make the few bureaucrats the enemy. Not Old Money. They played the electorate like Gekko played the dribbling stockholders of a vulnerable Company.

And through it all integrity, human contact are avoided. Emotionless decisions. Anyone who speaks of government of the people, for the people is easily laughed at or ignored. They even have the luxury of a split opposition. Another four years. In the end Bud was crying in the handcuffs. There is no penalty for saying the opposite of what is done.",1476057600,,1770,4.755700325732899

Don't miss the sequel, set (fictionally, and made in reality, about 15 years later, Wall Street, Money Never Sleeps[[ASIN:B004GWQTCG Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps].

Comedy?Drama genre.",1458172800,,526,5.6923076923076925
1397816,1,B000056KQN,"The hinge-point of this whole film is when Bud Fox's father verbally abuses him and embarrasses him in front of his friends and business associates. Carl, the father, calls Bud's girlfriend a whore. He uses appeal to emotion after appeal to emotion to overlook the fact that Bluestar was massively unprofitable and needed restructuring immediately. He humiliates his son by mocking the several summers Bud worked for Bluestar. He torpedoes the very deal that will save the company and return it to profitability, choosing his ""company men"" (union workers) over the son he's abandoned repeatedly for decades (including providing him with ""economic outpatient care""- i.e. enabling his son with loans that allow the son to enter into Wall Street in the first place).
Without Carl Fox's backing of the restructuring of Bluestar, Gordon Gecko chooses instead to liquidate the company. Since Bud Fox has a head full of emotional abuse he's just endured from his pathetic, weak father, he sides with his father and attacks Gordon Gecko in his office. ""Reality"" supposedly sets in after this and Bud Fox is able to have a ""clean conscience"" as the result of turning state's evidence against Gordon Gecko. Bud, just like his own father did to him, abandons the only father that nurtured him out of a genuine self-interest (which is true love). Under Gordon Gecko's tutelage, all of Bud's dreams come true and wealth is actually created in the market. By buckling under his father's abuse and returning to being a ""good boy"" for his father, Bud throws everything away and uses the State against Gordon Gecko for what is in truth wealth creation. Bud becomes his biological father and will be a loser and a leech for the rest of his life, especially because he will be going to prison.

The filmmaker clearly wants you to think that Gordon Gecko was a conniving snake the whole time and was just going to liquidate the company, regardless of what was achieved in a restructuring deal but I just don't buy it. The film was super solid up until this hinge point and then it just became a full-blown propaganda piece. Not a surprise to me that the character we're supposed sympathize with, the rootsy Carl Fox, is an emotional and verbal abuser with communistic tendencies. The screenwriters for the film are both NYC-born hard leftists with Jewish backgrounds that have turned to highly dissociative Buddhist practices in old-age. It wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination to say that their fathers, particularly Oliver Stone's, were abusive in much the same way that Carl Fox is in this film. Oliver Stone's father was an investment broker who ran his own father's securities firm into the ground. The firm was ultimately ended up in the hands of American Express.

This film engendered in a very big way the attitude of ""too big to fail"" (through emotional appeals to the ""workers at Bluestar keeping their jobs""). This same attitude put $700 billion dollars of Federal Reserve currency into the hands of failed banks in 2008.

Businesses MUST fail, by the laws of nature and of free market economics. Verbal abuse from a father to a son is NEVER okay, even if done under the guise of ""principles"". What is so often decried as ""greed"" and ""the profit motive"" by leftists is actually man's inherent and natural inclination to create wealth and value in the market place. Bud is finally becoming independent of his father's poisonous pedagogy when one final dose of vitriolic abuse reels him back in. The brainwashing is complete.

It takes a certain kind of hardiness and pain tolerance to liquidate companies when they are no longer profitable nor have been for some time, particularly when restructuring plans fall through because of emotionally abusive leftists. This hardiness is portrayed to the viewers, and awkwardly so, as a kind of evil to be opposed. This is flat out wrong and this film is, in and of itself, abusive through manipulation.
To accept a life in the free market, where all human value is created, we must accept the hardiness of emotional pain tolerance and we must break from the poisonous doctrines of our collectivist parents. We must be willing to cut out the cancers when they are killing us (Bluestar was no doubt financed through deficit).
Remember, it was Gordon Gecko who was fully transparent in asking the employees to take a pay cut and work harder so that they may have a profit sharing program (take a look at Costco or Les Schwab, the employees LOVE their profit sharing). It was Carl Fox who was the verbal and emotional abuser with communist sympathies. It was Bud Fox who stabbed Gordon Gecko in the back, derailing all of Gordon's effort to remain out of the clutches of the State.
Despite his flaws, like being unfaithful to his wife (a depiction I find unrealistic given how sweet Gecko is to his wife and son) or having a cigarette addiction, make no mistake: Gecko is a valuable and important part of a free society. Bud Fox ruined his own life by subsidizing his father's romanticizing but ultimately anachronistic and unlearning lifestyle. Bud Fox ruined Darien's life by punishing her for her loyalty. Bud Fox ruined Gecko's life by snitching on him to a government that always wants a dishonest cut. Bud Fox took Gordon Gecko away from his family.
Oliver Stone sold out by making this film, just like Bud Fox sold out by screwing over Gordon Gecko (cringefully depicted as the ""Devil"" in this film). With this film, Oliver Stone stabbed in the back the very industry, finance, that made New York City great. Wall Street has never been the same. Oliver Stone, through his parental alter-ego Bud Fox, became the devil in 1986. He failed to grieve his father's failure as an investment broker and instead used his tremendous artistic talent to delude millions of people.
Oliver Stone will never be brought to justice for his collusion in the brainwashing of an entire generation. He will die a wealthy Buddhist in a gated community, rich from the money a now-decimated middle class gave to him.",1458086400,,6032,4.842054263565892

1397830,4,B000056KQN,"With the film Wall Street (1987), Director Oliver Stone accomplished something that is nearly impossible - he made a film about Wall street, financial brokers, investors, etc. that was somewhat realistic and true and accurate, that isn't above people's heads in terms of understanding buy and sell tactics, and that is still entertaining.

He did this largely by focusing on very real and faulty characters and having a great cast to portray them. Everyone is ""grey"" (good and bad, not all good or all bad) in terms of their motives and behaviours. Even the Michael Douglas' ""villian"" role is so charismatic that he's likable, and he gets the best and most memorable lines and speeches in the film. Having Charlie Sheen's father in the film played by his real father, Martin Sheen, is another brilliant move... but only because of the strength of their acting.

It's a very good film, a unique and successful business themed film. If you like it, I highly suggest you watch the sequel Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps, which Oliver Stone made in 2010. Michael Douglas revives his role as Gordon Gekko in that film, but the plot is very different. You don't need to have seen the first film to appreciate the second film. Watching one will likely make you want to see the other.

Now here's a comparison of the DVD and the Blu-ray for the Wall Street film:
- For either, you get the single disc and no booklet or insert with chapter numbers/titles, etc.
- The menu on the DVD works fine but looks very dated. The menu on the Blu-ray looks very modern and slick and I like how the Chapter Selection works much better.
- The DVD special features are: commentary, making-of documentary, trailers and TV ad. The Blu-ray special features are: commentary, deleted scenes, 2 documentaries.
- The DVD is shown in 1.85:1 widescreen while the Blu-ray is shown in 2.35:1 widescreen, so you see the entire image as originally shown.
- On the DVD, the audio is adequate (English track in surround sound, French track in mono) and the video quality is rather poor and grainy... it feels like watching a VHS tape. On the Blu-ray, the audio is louder and clearer and the video is also much improved... although it feels like watching a good DVD. The film really needs a better remastering for the video.

Final verdict --- don't watch the DVD, get the Blu-ray. FYI - I found the Blu-ray in a sale bin for $3!!!!",1451952000,,2395,4.6548463356974

1397862,4,B000056KQN,"The movie is based on the stories of the mid 1980's insider trading scandals which put several big financiers in jail. The movie starts just before these events, with Bud Fox, a young financier wanting to hit the big time, and he meets Gordon Gekko, an older financier who has already done so, and takes him under his wing. Using insider information about the company Bud's father works for, Bud helps Gordon make a lot of money, and Gekko rewards him well. Bud is introduced to big money, fast women, and power, and all the trappings of being rich.

But Bud has not entirely abandoned his past. He introduces his working-class father to Gekko, who promises to buy the company Bud's father works for and make it work better. The father is unconvinced and reminds his son that the company's owners had struggled to make the company big, beginning with one airplane. Gordon buys the company and doesn't do as Bud had expected. What to do? It is hardly an attack on capitalism so much as the world of big money. The father's employer, after all, utilized the capitalist system to struggle for success. Also, Gekko, for all his money, has equally rich and powerful enemies, as is revealed early in the movie. And the government does get after Bud and Gekko in the end.

Michael Douglas gives a great performance as Gordon Gekko; everyone else pales in comparison. And the theme of the movie is relevant today, except the stakes have gotten worse. Many of the financial controls still in place in the 1980's were legally removed since then, the largest being the repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act which limited banks to where they could place their money...and we can thank Bill Clinton for that, though he did have bipartisan support. Which is why things have become so much messier today.",1436659200,,1783,4.711538461538462

1397879,5,B000056KQN,"At a moment about a third of the way through ""Wall Street"", Bud Fox, played with sincere naivet by Charlie Sheen, has just acquired all the things he has dreamed of: a lower east side apartment, a generous cash flow, his own office, connections to some of Wall Streets VIP's, and a beautiful interior decorator to whom he makes passionate love. And yet, he looks out from his million dollar pad into the night down at the city of New York and says ""Who am I?"" Bud's station in the world is at a new height, thanks largely to Gordon ""Greed"" Gekko, the financial mentor and stock/real estate investor who loves ""liquid"" more than sex.

""Wall Street"" is about a glimpse into the world of high stakes stock investments in NYC and how behind-the-scenes million-dollar deals affect the average person's life. A reliable and hard-working but underpaid employee of a stable company may find his job and therefore his income has disappeared--possibly overnight--when the company is traded to a new group of investors who decide to downsize the company in favor of a quick increase in stock value. And they in turn may decide to sell their shares to yet other investors who may or may not have the best interests of the company and/or their employees in mind. The free market system allows for the trading of certain companies to independent investors, and it can often be brutal for those who have the most to lose but have no influence on how the deals are struck.

""Wall Street"" centers on Bud Fox, a mediocre but ambitious stock sales rep for a mid-line stock brokerage firm. His dream is to acquire clients with deep pockets that will allow him to increase his sales commissions, and maybe even end up on the other side of the phone. He dreams of having Gordon Gekko, the dapper money magnate who, as one character put it, would sell his own mother down-river for a deal, and have her delivered COD. At the movie's start, we learn that Fox has been cold-calling Gekko's office for two months, and finally, on Gekko's birthday, Fox earns the millionaire's ear and eventually his business when Fox reveals some insider information about his father's airline company. Gekko puts in a large order of the airline's stock, and when the stock price increases, he's pleased Gekko, putting Fox into the upper echelon of sales reps at his brokerage.

Fox then becomes a willing pawn in a larger game where Gekko the financial chess-master moves money around the chessboard of Wall Street. But Gekko wants Buddy to do more than simply handle his stock transactions. He wants Buddy to acquire more insider information about certain companies, and even rival investors, to ensure that every stock transaction is a winner. And Gekko also has an agenda: he desires to outdo another investor magnate, Sir Laurence, who has even more liquid than Gecco with which to play the financial game. But what Fox knows is that some of what Gekko is asking him to do could be construed as insider trading, a felony...

The story becomes about how Fox gets pulled into the deals of larger-than-life titanic investors, and how promises are often broken, high stake deals are hashed out, and the only God that exists is the power of unlimited amounts of liquid, a.k.a. money. There are even a couple of split screen sequences in which the news about a stock's volatility travels around the many different ears which in turn influences the price of the stock. Such rumors can either push the value of a stock up or depreciate its value, and we watch from both directions.

The acting as well as the storyline are superb, with an Oscar-winning performance by Michael Douglas as the money magnate from Hell. Charlie Sheen is equally as believable as the sales rep who thought he knew a lot about Wall Street before realizing the world of high-stakes investing is a lot more complex and competitive then he ever realized. By movie's end, he comes to the conclusion that money is not everything.",1432512000,,3955,4.742732558139535

1397919,5,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is a film directed by Oliver Stone and stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Daryl Hannah. The screenplay was written by Stanley Weiser and Stone. The film tells the story of Bud Fox, a young stockbroker desperate to succeed who becomes involved with his hero, Gordon Gekko, a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider. Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the Great Depression.

""Greed is Good"".This is the credo of the aptly named Gordon Gekko, the antihero of Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Gekko, a high-rolling corporate raider, is idolized by young-and-hungry broker Bud Fox. Inveigling himself into Gekko's inner circle, Fox quickly learns to rape, murder and bury his sense of ethics. Only when Gekko's wheeling and dealing causes a near-tragedy on a personal level does Fox ""reform""-though his means of destroying Gekko are every bit as underhanded as his previous activities on the trading floor. Director Stone, who co-wrote Wall Street with Stanley Weiser, has claimed that the film was prompted by the callous treatment afforded his stockbroker father after 50 years in the business; this may be why the film's most compelling scenes are those between Bud Fox and his airline mechanic father.

It is Stone's most impressive achievement in this film is to allow all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense.",1422921600,,1436,5.132478632478633

1397922,5,B000056KQN,"After seeing The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) I decided to watch the original film about the Wall Street from 1987, the same year the New York stock market crashed. The Wall Street, starting Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen, compared to The Wolf of Wall Street is much more PG and very much 80's movie.  I think, Michael Douglas stole the show in this one from under Charlie Sheen, who happens to be the main character in the movie.  Charlie Sheen is Bud Fox, and an up and coming young and ambitious broker working for some company, yet he is eager to go the extra mile, eve if it means breaking the law, in order to be at the top of the food chain.  That is when Gordon Gekko comes in (Michael Douglas) a big shark in the nyc corporate world.  The script is really well written and acting is tight, the ending to the movie just about perfect.  Interesting soundtrack, especially the title song from 80's Canadian band Talking Heads, which can also be found in the movie Lars and The Real Girl (2007).

The speech about greed and American way of life given by Douglas at the share holder's meeting is one of the best short speeches I have heared and seen on the silver screen.  Michael's character is what makes this movie.

Oliver Stone directed this film right after finishing The Platoon (1986) both of which films happen to be his best works.",1422576000,,1346,4.443089430894309

1397970,5,B000056KQN,"For all it's quirks and minor flaws Oliver Stone's Wall Street almost perfectly captures the cynical power hungry, money obsession culture that seemed to consume people in the later 80's era. Made after Platoon, many consider this the equivalent ""war in the city"" guns replaced with a notepad and computer with stock listings.

This harks back to a time when Stone was at his peak in film direction.

Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is the perky ambitious lower level stockbroker desperate to break into the big league in the city. His idol is Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) a powerful and ruthless businessman who seems to hold all the cards in the stock market. Bud eventually manages to get Gekko's attention and soon becomes his on the street hawk who is sourcing information about rival corporations, to aid Gekko's and his insider trading stock building plan.

Bud soon starts to enjoy his newly found lavish lifestyle, a far cry from his minor stockbroker struggling with debt previous life. Things take a turn for the worse when Bud tries to use the information he's gained about a company his father works at (Bluestar Airlines) Gekko's plan is to run the company down and strip the assets. Bud has to take a look at what he's become part of and examine his own flawed ambition.

The film works well on just about every level, Sheen is good as the up and coming green but keen city player, Douglas is perfectly cast and performs a sizzling greedy, arrogant and utterly ruthless Gordon Gekko, it's the part he was made for and he pulls it off easily. We have a good supporting cast overall Terence Stamp, Hal Holbrook, Martin Sheen as Bud's father, and even John C. McGinley (from Platoon) makes an appearance. There is a documentary on the DVD version and we learn from this that Daryl Hannah who plays Darien Taylor, was really uncomfortable and not happy at all making the film. She might be a weaker part compared to other performances, but nothing that dents the impact of the film.

Stone directs with confidence, look out for some good Cinematography by Robert Richardson (the World Trade centre is seen at the start) You also get a nice flashback feeling technology wise in a pre smart phone era, with just simple green screen computers decidedly low tech by modern standards. For me the film works, though some feel the it spurned a period of ""Gekko"" culture as the character became something of an icon for would be business super heroes. Gekko is really a reflection of the time period and just mirrors the events and mentality of some people. The film is a drama and like all fictional works shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it does send a fairly important message on a moral level.

Still a great film, and a one of the best of it's genre.",1416528000,,2757,4.674226804123712

1397998,5,B000056KQN,"What makes a character legendary? Is it the actor, the script, or is it due to some sort of movie magic? Is it an amalgam of all three? What makes a character immortal?

Maybe it's an illusion. Maybe it's Gordon Gekko.

Oliver Stone's Wall Street is superb. After the jungles of Vietnam, Stone set his focus on the concrete jungle of New York. This film is wildly good, sensationally so. A masterpiece. Many reviewers try to charge this film negatively for being a product of its era, as if a film made in the '80s is inherently awful because of the staples intrinsically aligned with the period. This is a baseless criticism and only serves to identify the reviewer's snobbish bias. It's as if people don't like the '80s more than they don't like this film. Each decade has their own qualities that age poorly and to say that the '80s are unique in this aging process would be both arrogant and uneducated. The film has aged perfectly well, I see no faults in the wrinkles on its skin. As critics and film historians, we must be able to watch films of any era with maturity, not with generational apprehension. These new reviewers have attempted to disregard this film as mere by-product of the '80s. Well, in a major way it is. In what other age of excess and greed could something like this ever have been made possible?

This is essentially a film about the rise and fall of a starry eyed young man as he stakes his claim on Wall Street. He has two father figures who attempt to mentor him, one nudging him towards honor and respectability and the other pulling him into the high gravity world of materialism and avarice. One of whom is his own natural father, the other being none other than Gordon Gekko. This brings us to the first theme I would like to cover, the two embattled fathers of American culture. Represented by Martin Sheen is integrity through hard work and honesty in fair business. Sheen is the symbol of a diligent America, of an America where blue collar workers are united in solidarity and friendship through hard work and toil. For the sake of analyzation, we shall refer to him as 'the worker'. Gekko is emblematic of the new American dogma, he is representative of greed and calculation. He stands for everything the worker fights against. From blue collar solidarity to white collar crime, out with the old and in with the new, welcome to the jungle. The father figure theme is a fascinating one. The youth of America are all born with these two opposing ideological patriarchal beliefs. One is infinitely more attractive than the other. It is easy to be seduced by greed, this is a characteristic inherent of the twisted modern social condition. The young are forgetting all about hard work as they set their sights on the easy money of a quick scheme. The worker stands for dying institutions of thought that have failed to adapt to the new pyramid-based economic climate of buyouts and liquidations. The worker is a creator, the industrious artisan of a bygone morality. Gekko is the new capitalist ethos of buying and selling trades, materials, and stocks. There is a certain flaw ingrained into the new economic system of greed by means of commerce, it is the flaw of unimaginative inaction. Men posing as sharks, workers bleed out. A shark will not go hungry. A shark will get its fill. Welcome to the abyss.

Every once in a while when I am really amazed and moved by a performance, I tag the review under 'best acted'. The actor is then inducted into my personal hall of fame. I would like to welcome Michael Douglas into this coveted collection. As Gordon Gekko, Douglas was a beast. A perfect performance in every conceivable dimension. THAT LOOK in his eyes. I have never seen an actor communicate so much with his eyes. THAT GRIN that says a thousand things. Douglas was flawless, a performance of calculation and execution. A performance based in seduction. That was his job, his task was to seduce the audience. He succeeded in every possible facet. I really mean it, Michael Douglas was immaculate, he was otherworldly. Whenever they say an actor was born to play a certain role, they're talking about Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko. This is the epitome of exemplary skill. Not a single frame is wasted on him, not one single moment in his presence is allowed to occur without his positive magic and genius. A brilliant, unbeatable exhibition of prowess and unsettlingly potent pathos. If you wanna talk about the best of the best, you found it. Michael Douglas crafted a legend, a mythic screen character. One of the most feared, revered, admonished, and beloved. More than an archetype, he was passion in its truest shape. A mind-blowingly perfect and incendiary role. A perfect actor, a perfect character, perfect magic.

This is absolutely, positively, without a doubt in my mind the best performance of the '80s. Sure, there are others that can compete (Jeremy Irons in Dead Ringers immediately comes to mind) but no other portrayal is as emblematic of '80s America than that of Gordon Gekko. A delineation of time. Not a likeness nor a rendition of the '80s ethos but rather the very existence of its character. In a spirited tour de force, Michael Douglas encapsulated everything that the '80s stood for. It is the best performance of the '80s because of talent, skill, genius, charisma, and time. Because the film, like the characters it depicted and like the era it was borne of, was opportunist in nature.

The Gekko illusion. He speaks often of illusions, about the physical properties of them and their effects on society. That the mass belief in an illusion of promise is capitalism as its finest. Could we also assume that Gekko himself is a carefully constructed illusion? We are given small fragments of soul, of heart, in slivers of Gordon Gekko. In looking longingly at a tranquil, all-knowing sunset or by the sour revelation of being betrayed by his protege, Douglas expresses the deepest pathos I have ever felt. He also reveals the secret of Gordon Gekko. That, like the capitalist illusion, he is also a composite of delicately crafted fabrications. That everything about his demeanor and success is an illusion, he's shielding himself from something darker. For an invincible titan, he is plenty vulnerable to personal hurts as caused by betrayal from others and by the deception of others and of self. Gordon Gekko is an illusion, a mirage of masculinity and superiority. What of the man inside? Something tells me that this driven man was once incredibly weak and that, in some ways, his spirit was already crippled to begin with.

Oliver Stone directed this film astonishingly well. His brief use of split-screen (proving he's the best at the technique after Brian De Palma) and his off camera prodding of the actors work for the film to a phenomenal degree. It's his camerawork that dazzles me. So much of it is handheld and whizzing back and forth, it's brilliant, intimate, and intense! He also uses the camera's behavior as a means of communicating subtext within a scene. For instance, there is a conversation between Charlie Sheen and James Spader that occurs during Sheen's transformation from a naive dreamer into a legitimate wall street player. The camera's conduct communicates this transformation better than any line of dialogue could. To represent Sheen's evolution into corrupt avarice and stretched morality, Stone's camera is constantly in motion, moving in and out, close and far and close again. Almost as though losing focus, as if the camera lost the ability to frame his new state of mind. This is not an overt technique, Stone proves with his expressive camera that he is very capable of subtlety. Scenes like these abound, they make up Stone's masterpiece for it is truly lyrical storytelling. A conscientious camera, expressing pathos and plot lines by its behavior just as articulately as the dialogue of the actors it films.

""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.""

A theme or a motto? The era provides it with credence. In a masterfully written and consummately acted monologue, Wall Street perfectly sums up the modern enterprise of monopoly and fortune. Spewed back in the face of its disciples, this monologue is now the stuff of widely quoted legend. I will not go into whether or not I think greed is good, the film's purpose is to seduce you by means of Gekko into applauding his disturbing sentiments. And you do, every time. Expressive of just how easy it is to be swept away by charisma, promise, and opportunity. How fast the illusion can become real. Gekko lives on, forever in the hearts of young men at the crossroads of existence.

In closing, I would like to praise Wall Street for being such a great film. An absolute masterpiece of '80s filmmaking and one of the best films ever made.",1407974400,,8808,4.785009861932939
1397999,5,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is a great presentation of 'a Wall Street', if not THE Wall Street.  It presents an Ivan Boesky-type stock trader in Michael Douglas, an ambitious up-and-comer in Charlie Sheen, and a Wall Street groupie in Darryl Hannah.  The story simply follows Sheen as he becomes more and more ruthless in trying to impress Douglas and get ahead on 'the Street' by any means necessary.  The moral dilemma is an increasingly growing element in the drama; should he(C.Sheen) break rules, undercut his father(Martin Sheen)'s company and craft union, all in the name of getting rich?  The resolution of this is well-done and uses Terence Stamp as the ultimate stock trader and manipulator.

If you think the trader talk will be over your head it won't, Stone makes it pretty understandable and puts much leverage on the characters decisions to keep it juicy. Win or go home. Another brilliant thing Oliver Stone did was putting the father and son at odds with their career choices, this keeps the film relatable. They could have easily made a movie that confused the hell out of the audience with this world of stocks and dealings. Great script too which can be found online. Superb commentary and doc's.

1398015,5,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is a classic from a time when America's film culture was changing forever. After the ""Golden Age"" of cinema, when the classic novels had been portrayed on-screen through the nuclear patriarch's point of view, Hollywood underwent a violent cultural revolution and stirred up the melting pot. After the broth settled, a new layer of grease rose to the top in the form of multimillionaire Wall Street sponsors, who sought to use the advances in psychology and social science of the '70s to transform the media into a self-indulgent, money-making propaganda machine.
Oliver Stone spits in the face of the new kings of America. The story of the pawned everyman Bud Fox shows what the satanism of egotism and greed can do to the human soul. Further and further down into the depths of hell Fox goes as he gains everything America told him he wanted in life: millions of dollars, bought respect, beautiful women, and all the luxury the city of New York has to offer; yet, he only grows more and more at odds with himself.
What happens when Bud realizes that money cannot buy him what he truly wants: happiness, or his father's ever-elusive approval? Has he dug himself a foxhole so deep that he can never escape?",1395619200,,1217,4.745283018867925

1398050,5,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is a remarkably good looking movie. The mise-en-scne and mise-en-shot are irrefutably of a calibre that is well beyond that of the metteur-en-scne and puts Olive Stone firmly in the category of a movie auteur who provides the ""rising tide that lifts all boats"" (director's commentary).  The acting by Michael Douglas , Charlie Sheen, Terence Stamp, Daryl Hannah,  Sean Young  and James Spader is consistently excellent. The good guys win.  Bud Fox experiences redemption via which, and jail time,  he avoids the moral abyss. Gordon Gecko (bad-guy-in-chief) goes to jail.  And thus, on these levels, Wall Street is a winner on all counts.  However, upon reflection, this movie is the moral abyss.

The only winner in this drama, is the government. Which makes Oliver Stone, a more skilful minister of propaganda, than Joseph Goebels or Vyacheslav Molotov. A master eiron, given Oliver Stone's  (self-propagated, for the most part)  popular image as a warrior against big and interventionist government.  So, where did it all go wrong? Well . . . It all went wrong at the time when Bud Fox chose to back the losing side. Instead of negotiating a better cut of the action with Gordon Gecko, over his change of mind about Blue Star Airlines, Bud Fox chose to double-cross Gordon Gecko. If Bud Fox had chosen more wisely, he could have walked away with millions, given his father a million or two, which his father, directly or indirectly, could have used to help out his buddies while they looked for other work.  But by not doing this, the Blue Star Airline workers were still out of job; Gordon Gecko and Bud Fox went to jail; the inherited wealth had fewer alternatives to make money, by doing nothing;  and the government won.

To be fair, though, and as an irony in itself:  If Oliver Stone had wanted to make Wall Street as this kind of a more rational movie, it would probably have net with a very cool reception, at the US box office. Then again, the true auteur has a higher calling, than the US box office.",1368403200,,2024,4.726495726495727

1398071,5,B000056KQN,"Yet another movie that I would watch bits and pieces of on cable--before finally getting around to viewing in its entirety--Oliver Stone's Wall Street is one of the finest movies, arguably the finest, that I have ever seen.

--Spoilers Ahead--

Wall Street opens beautifully with montages of Manhattan ""waking up"" to a golden, sunny morning--Frank Sinatra singing in the back ground. How can you beat that? It stars Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox (youthful; growing/sly as a), a young twenty-something who has chosen to by-pass law school in the hopes of making it big on Wall Street.

Working at Jackson Steinham & Co., Fox spends his workdays cold-calling potential clients (Fox has a list of wealthy doctors, lawyers, etc--and ""cold-calls"" them, out of the blue, hoping to sell them huge blocks of stock which he believes will be the ""next big thing"").

Oh yeah, there is another thing Bud does every workday: he calls up the already legendary Wall Street ""player,"" Gordon Gekko (lizard), portrayed by one of my favorite actors: Michael Douglas.

Bud is hoping to get ""just ten minutes of"" Gekko's time. After yet another turn-down, he laments to his co-worker pal Marv (John C. McGinley), that one day he wants to be the guy on the other end of that phone. ""Don't we all,"" Marv replies, adding that ""the Gekkos don't talk to the nobodies such as us.""

Fortunately (or unfortunately) Bud isn't one to easily be dissuaded.

On Gordon Gekko's birthday, Bud, handsome young man that he is, charms his way through Gekko's office--and personal secretary--and manages to get himself a meeting with Gekko. It doesn't hurt that he has brought along a birthday present: some Havana cigars (Gordon's favorites).

Before entering Gordon's immense, intimidating inner sanctum, Fox adjusts his tie, takes a very deep breath, and says: ""Life comes down to a few moments--this is one of them.""

He then proceeds to totally mess up. Having initially impressed Gekko with his persistence, he stammers on about being ""a fan"" and tries to sell him on some boring, going absolutely nowhere, stocks. Sensing that he is about to blow the whole deal, Bud lets slip some insider information: Bluestar Airlines is about to win a lawsuit and is in the process of setting itself up to become a major player in the airline industry. His father, Carl, played by real-life father, Martin Sheen, has given him this information innocently--Carl Fox is the chief mechanic, and union rep, at Bluestar.

Gekko pounces on this information and uses it to his HUGE advantage. He also decides to use Bud for his own personal advantage, too. Seducing him with dreams of wealth, power, drugs and beautiful women--one in particular, interior designer Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah)--whom Bud falls head-over-heels for--Gekko gets Bud to secure insider information for him...particularly inside information concerning one Sir Lawrence Wildman (Terence Stamp)--a corporate raider with a lot more wealth and power than Gekko, himself.

It seems Sir Larry stole a pharmaceutical company out from GG's nose a (not too long) while back. Gordon loathes him.

Bud is quite successful in his role. He does gain some insider info that Gekko is able to use to ""hurt"" Wildman (more embarrass than hurt, actually, but I digress...). Bud also gets a promotion at work--including his own office; a new, luxurious apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side; and fantastic sex every night with his new, gorgeous ""girlfriend"" (actually, Darien Taylor is yet just another one of Gordon Gekko's pawns).

Bud even decides to help make his old law school friend, Roger Barnes (James Spader) rich with his newfound knowledge--all the while trying to gain inside information from him, too!

Yeah, Bud has completely gone off of the deep end....and it all starts to crash down around him.

Bud wants Gordon to gain control of Bluestar Airlines and let him (Bud) run it. Gordon, however, wants to trash the airline and soak all the remaining stock money out of it that he can.  To Bud's face, he goes along with his plan (while all the time twisting the knife).

Even worse, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is starting to get wise to Bud's schemes. They start ""sniffing around"" Bud so much that Roger Barnes tells him to stay away.

The worst, however, hits when Carl (at a Bluestar/Gekko/Bud meeting) tells Bud (in front of Gekko, no less) that the whole ""benevolent takeover"" is a fraud--and even if it isn't, how does ""working summers in baggage"" qualify Bud to be Bluestar's president? This leads to a father/son blow-up, and shortly afterwards Carl suffers a (non-fatal) heart attack.

In addition to his father's heart attack, Bud has also (now) found out about Gordon's betrayal; his relationship with Darien ends when she refuses to stand with him against Gekko; (and) he is forced to sell his apartment.

In a great scene, a world-weary Bud Fox, realizing what he has (or almost has) become, leans against a tree in downtown New York. A tree that is the only ""real"" thing, amid a fantasy world of kitsch and glamor, that has supported him in the past few fantastic, wonderful, and ultimately horrible, months. Great job of symbolism here by director Oliver Stone.

Bud hatches a scheme to save Bluestar. Turning to Larry Wildman of all people, he gets him to agree to save Bluestar in exchange for an iron-clad contactual promise he won't destroy it. Wildman buys up all of Bluestar's stock, right from under Gekko's nose, and gains a (quite) financially viable airline, while at the same time making Gordon Gekko look like a fool.

Yes, (Sir) Larry Wildman wins.

Bud does not.

Gekko sells out Bud Fox to the SEC, and he gets arrested--at work, of all places, and is humiliated in front of everyone. However, Bud then proceeds to ""sell out"" (if you can call it that) Gordon Gekko, wearing a wire and getting GG to admit to his illegal ways of doing business. Gekko will have to ultimately settle for a couple of (well-placed) punches to Bud Fox's face as the only ""victory"" he is going to claim in this movie. He is about to go to jail. For a very long time.

Bud is, too, but at least it won't be for long--most likely, less than a year. Driven to the courthouse by his parents, Carl tells Bud that ""maybe this is for the best."" That now Bud can get the foolishness out of his life and go on from here to make something of himself. The real--not the fantasy--way.

The movie ends with Bud Fox walking up the courthouse on a gray, dreary, winterish day. Great shot; even greater symbolism.

My thoughts on this fantastic movie in a moment, but let me first go over the dvd's

Special Features

Disc One--The dvd contains an excellent commentary track by director Oliver Stone. It is literally Film-making 101 for any aspiring, would-be, directors out there. And, it is highly entertaining in its own right. If you like this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it at least once with the commentary own. Stone gives away a wealth of added information to go along with your (regular movie) viewing experience.

Disc Two--There are two excellent documentaries found here. One is entitled Money Never Sleeps-The Making of Wall Street. The other  is Greed is Good. Both documentaries add even more to your viewing experience. Money goes into great detail about WS's casting: Michael Douglas was not the first choice for the role of Gordon Gekko--Warren Beatty and Richard Gere were the actors first considered for the part. The fact that Wall Street was released shortly after the Stock Market Crash of 1987, was in no way an attempt to capitalize on tragedy. Stone discusses that the movie had already been show and had its release date set well before Black Monday occurred.

Greed is Good talks about the movie's themes and touches on the fact that Gordon Gekko is actually considered a role model for many aspiring Wall Street players. The documentary contains interviews with several real-life Wall Street players, and they discuss why and how the fictional character of Gordon Gekko inspired them to do what they are doing (or hope to be doing). Is Gordon Gekko really an evil person? This is discussed in lengthy detail.

There are also deleted scenes and a nice movie introduction by Oliver Stone, himself.

My Thoughts

*To begin, the movie is excellent. As I already have said, it is arguably the best movie I have ever seen--it is definitely on the short list. I should add that I have never had any interest in the stock market, MBAs, or business, itself...at least, no interest in pursuing any kind of career at all in this field. Yet, this is one of my favorite movies--so that in itself speaks volumes of what an excellent, entertaining movie this is.

*Please allow me to also add that the first time I showed this movie to my fiancee--an artist, with no interest in business, either--as soon as the film was over, she pulled Disc Two out and watched both of its documentaries. She liked this movie that much!

*I love the ""feel"" of this movie. It screams New York, Manhattan and the 1980s all over. I love this. While this movie should not be defined as a ""1980s movie"" it does excellently capture...from the hair, to the fashions...to the everything...just the entire essence of the 1980s in the City. Again, I love this!

*Gordon Gekko has some great quotes:

(Speaking about a rival) ""The guy is such a loser, if he owned funeral parlors, nobody would die!""

""Greed is good.""  The film's iconic line. This line is delivered at a stockholder's meeting that Gordon Gekko, along with Bud and Darien, attends. Gekko is in the process of taking this company over, and in front of the large assembly, he totally humiliates the company's president (Richard Dysart-the ""funeral parlor guy""), whose only response is to call Gekko ""greedy"" and ""out of line.""  Gekko responds with a discourse on how we live by our own greed for things in life: love (which is ironic, considering just a few scenes earlier he told Darien that he and she were too smart to believe in ""anything such as love""), wealth, happiness...and concludes with, ""Greed, for lack of a better term, is good.""

 ""If you want a friend, get a dog.""

(Hysterically angry after learning he has been ""betrayed""--he does not yet know it is Bud who betrayed him) ""I will tear his eyeballs out. I will suck his f***ing skull!""

Wow.

And, not so much a quote, but early on in the film GG gives Bud an ultimatum: you are either with me (as a industrial spy) or not. Fox bites, and Gordon Gekko, peering out through the open window of his limousine, gives the most wickedly evil and charming smile you could ever hope to see.

*You do know, don't you, that Michael Douglas won the 1987 Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko? I thought so.

*Not so much a ""thought"" but I want to mention that this movie's excellent cast also includes: Sean Young, Franklin Cover, Saul Rubinek, Tamara Tunie and Hal Holbrook as Lou Mannheim.

Mannheim, based on Oliver Stone's father, works with Bud Fox at Jackson Steinham & Co. and provides reason and conscience (along with Carl Fox) to Bud throughout the movie. In particular, right before Bud is arrested by the SEC, he pulls Bud aside and tells him (putting his arm around him) that he ""likes him."" And that: ""Man looks in the abyss. There's nothing staring back at him. At that moment, man finds his character, and that is what keeps him out of the abyss.""

*It is nice to see this movie's ""wisdom"" come from Bud's father and Mr. Mannheim. Two ""Everyman"" type characters--and not the characters with all of the wealth and power.

Finally

An irony of this movie is that, while Gekko is the ""villain"" and Wildman is the ""hero"" who helps save the day...their roles could easily be reversed. Gekko has, no doubt, bought businesses in the past--to rebuild--and will no doubt (once he gets out of jail) do so again in the future.  Wildman, has bought (and--I'm certain--will continue to do so) businesses simply to shut them down.  He's also played fast and loose with the rules--he stole the aforementioned pharmaceutical company from Gekko by bribing one of GG's secretaries for inside info.  The difference between these two men is: Gekko, in this movie, does not have any qualms in using/seducing Bud Fox to do his bidding.  Whether Wildman would do the same...well, we aren't told.

Furthermore, I do believe that Gordon Gekko's character does like Bud Fox. I believe GG sees a younger version of himself. Perhaps he sees his own youthful self--before he became corrupt--and deep-down likes that...who knows?

Finally, I do not, as some apparently do, see Wall Street as anti-American, or even anti-capitalism. It does rail against capitalism out-of-control: ""Greed is good,"" etc, etc. And, I do agree with this particular sentiment, which reminds me of Theodore Dreiser's short story, A Deal in Wheat. However, anything taken to the extreme level is certainly never, ever good...and, considering capitalism is our system--I am glad we have warnings such as this out there, firmly in place. It is not right to profit off of the misfortunes of others. That is, in my estimation, what this movie is about: a condemnation of a particular form of capitalism, but certainly not anti-American propaganda.

If only this film was required viewing for all of our elected officials.

Thank you for reading.

1398073,5,B000056KQN,"Although oliver stone captured the mood of modern times with this expose of wall street life and the ethos of modern times we need to actually understand his view and see what to make of it? He wants viewers to know a seminal experience for him was vietnam,whatever that exactly was for him,and that's really where he learned about people...it is true that people who go to war are inextricably changed by it...and many cant cope and a reading of case studies elucidates this point of traumatized soldiers,...so to be fair that's his view at looking at modern life..of course he has the experience of new york and wall street and his view of one person and his effect and what he tries to do in this financial hub. This film i recall watching on tv when younger,and it had three of my favorite stars,which Stone surprisingly cast in this film,not really known for acting in these kinds of roles and he took a big risk in casting them...and while filming he had problems pruning their talents as they may have been going through personal issues. A business movie...not always the kind of movie people want to view...and for that reason he puts in the romance of Hannah to appeal to a larger audience...and i think its there for that reason only...and he was surprised she took the role. Since this is a serious role and since it fits in,are these characters,douglas' alter ego of gyetko well put together by him,typical of american conservatism...or are they solipist type characters?I always disliked ayn rand for propagating these kinds of characters and philosophies,and so called freedoms,and the Douglas character says you are not living really in democracy but in a cpitalist haven, for that reason i see this as an ayn rand type person,a controversial figure novelist whom even the conservative icon william f buckley was not that comfortable with and i was perusing after watching the film collected speeches by him,and the same thought crossed his mind solipsism,a business person who uses all his wiles and means,not always legally,to build up a huge fortune and at times leaving a destruction of bankrupt companies and interference in the free market system...which detrimentally effects too many lives..as the union capitalist debate in this film dovetails. The two sheen's also are involved in father -son,betrayal type relationships...which the Douglas character is also involved in. Stone does allow the Douglas character a long speech on american capitalism..in defense of it..but he like most solipsists care little about anything,family,friends...nation...but only the enlargement of their self...the 'grandiose self.'
Douglas does try to groom charlie to be a 'person' like him,not just to fulfill a job,...and he at film's end feels betrayed..and who else does the director want us to feel is being betrayed. The world of union politics versus capitalism,of the workers international,belongs in 'hard times' and charles dickens,the world we inhabit today is a globalized world...promoting capitalism is not enough...the countries moving ahead now are also internally restructuring in this complex world...a la the philosophy of bill gates the education guru...every nation today is capitalist..a modern economy is really needed and all that means to be successful...but a good film viewed many years later...with three of my favorite people many years ago surprisingly in this film,in which the author uses his war experiences to develop a fable..and i long hoped for a sequel and will watch it next as should all viewers of this film",1339804800,,3553,5.138169257340242
1398074,4,B000056KQN,"It must be interesting to work in the financial world, but it's certainly not a topic that attracts the attention of most moviegoers. Whenever we see stockbrokers depicted on the screen, it appears to be utter chaos. Screens show numbers, people shout and make frantic phone calls, and we discern from their reactions whether they made money or not.

Wall Street overcomes some of the limitations of the subject matter by giving us well-acted characters that we care about. Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) begins the story as a struggling broker who hopes to one day make a phone call that will change his life. Most of his potential clients aren't in a position to do that, but one is.

Gordon Gekko (Douglas) doesn't waste a second of his time when he's working, and he's usually working. After calling for 59 days straight, Bud delivers a box of Cuban cigars on Gekko's birthday and is given five minutes to convince him that he can help the man make money. He doesn't really hold Gekko's attention, but uses a desperate ploy before he is thrown out. Bud's father, Carl (Martin Sheen), works for Bluestar Airlines and has given Bud information about the company which will result in the price of the stock rising. Gekko decides to take a chance and Bud is hired.

It soon becomes clear to Gekko that Bud had inside information. He tells him that he doesn't like to lose and he'll need similar information in the future if he's to keep him around. Bud has a decision to make. Does he try to work ethically and within the law, or take a chance and do what Gekko asks? This is a story of greed and corruption and we see Bud take the latter option. He follows around another investor in an attempt to find out what company the man might be trying to buy. The information is useful to Gekko and he makes a fortune.

Bud's life will never be the same. He's finally on a path that will result in him becoming a major player. He begins spending money on a new apartment and artwork which reflects his success. He also starts a relationship with a woman who would normally have been beyond his reach. We see what money and success can do to a person. Previous relationships are harmed or completely abandoned. His father is an ethical man and is particularly hurt by Bud's actions. Despite warnings from some of his colleagues, Bud ruthlessly pursues success.

Will Bud achieve his dream and stay one step ahead of the law? Can he continue to provide Gekko with enough relevant information? Will he prove his father and work colleagues wrong?

Charlie Sheen is convincing as Bud, but the real highlight of the film is the Oscar-winning performance from Michael Douglas. He exudes power and gives the impression that he doesn't tolerate failure in any form. He's a brilliant public speaker and easily wins the support of companies he's taking over, even if he means to destroy them.

It's very strange seeing images of the twin towers in older films and it's a little sobering to see them here. There are a few other things which date the film and the funniest change has to be the differences in technology. Take a look at the computer screens without laughing or at cell phones the size of a brick.

I always take note when a film holds my interest with subject matter that I usually find boring. Wall Street is one such film and it's a gripping drama.

The Blu-ray presentation is disappointing to say the least. The picture quality is barely adequate and some of the longer shots look like an upconverted DVD. You can normally count on Fox, so maybe it's the fault of the source material?",1333152000,,3577,4.58528951486698
1398075,4,B000056KQN,"Greed.  Lust.  Power.  Corruption.  Riches.  But enough about serving in Congress and the White House.  Back before dot-coms and cyber trading and Google there was Poker-faced stock trading; it is the quintessential evolutionary process.  And the intoxicating allure of power and mind-boggling wealth is brought to the forte in Oliver Stone's classic WALL STREET.  It's a trip down memory lane to go back and view this film again, with its DOS computer prompts and portable phones the size of Rhode Island.  Long before wealth and success and ambition were demonized by our culture, Stone depicts a young stockbroker's foray into lugubrious corruption and power; yet once young Bud Fox gets his first taste of blood in the water, it's not long before he's in over his head, and then the price to pay becomes daunting indeed.  And it's just as much fun to watch today as it was in 1987.

Charlie Sheen (long before the substance abuse took its toll on his boyish looks) is marvelous as the easily-impressed, ultimately overwhelmed Fox; Bud just wants to make his father (played by real-life papa Martin) proud of him, plus make his own way in the world.  Which makes him a prime candidate for seduction by financier extraordinaire Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas was born to play this role); once Bud gets a glimpse of Gordon's world with its fabulous riches and power, he willingly does what he knows is dead wrong (not to mention illegal):  making money via insider trading.  Naturally over the course of events Bud's life unravels, and the SEC comes calling--and even Gekko himself is no longer immune to the justice coming over the horizon.  And at the risk of being redundant, it's very fun to watch.

In addition to Douglas and the two Sheens WALL STREET sports a grand cast, including John C. McGinley, Hal Holbrook, Daryl Hannah, and the wonderful Terence Stamp.  One star off due to the vapidity of the subject matter and its often simplistic manifestation, but hey, greed still takes center stage.  Nowadays we would just be concerned if Bud and Gordo would pay their fair share; after all, the corruption has now shifted to the Potomac.

After reading some of the reviews, I expected an awful picture.  Video quality varied in this movie, some of it being poor, and some being pretty good.  There is a lot of grain in some scenes.  On a 10 point scale, I give it a range between 4.5 and 8.0 (I have never rated a Blu-Ray less than 4.0).  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie.

1398082,4,B000056KQN,"I had seen this movie many years ago and watched it again last week.  It was just as enjoyable as it was the first time around.

In this movie, ambitious stock broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) finally hooks up with Wall Street shark Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) to make easy money, and lots of it quickly.  Gekko accomplishes his goals by buying companies and splitting them up, and by collecting insider information from people around him.  At some point Bud Fox finds himself at odds with his father who believes in making a living the good old-fashioned way, by working hard and becoming useful.

The premise of this movie is that the greed is good in all its shapes and forms as disclosed in a speech by Gekko at the height of the story.  Well, I don't know about you, but I disagree with that proposition.  Greed is like anything else: a good motivator in moderation, but very destructive in excess.  The latest examples of this point was the mortgage backed security debacle which almost destroyed the whole economy.  However, other excesses continue in the form of multi-million dollar CEO salaries.  Greed causes imbalances in the economy kind of like constipation in the human body.  Maybe greed is good for the greedy, but at the expense of destroying the lives of many others.

Then, bang, it turned my fantasy on its head, and showed the incredible ugliness and soullessness behind the fantasy.  (At this point I considered turning off the movie, as I started feeling physically repulsed.  Thankfully I hung in there.)  But then, shocker of shockers, the plot changed, the ugliness was exposed for what it was, and the protagonist came to his senses:  he realized the false path he was on and used the power he had gained to try to salvage himself.  He may not have salvaged himself perfectly, but he did a damn good job.

The acting, overall, was excellent.  Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen were stunning, and so were most of the lesser characters.  Charlie Sheen was great overall, but had some occasionally weak moments that detracted from the film's believability.  Daryl Hannah was good overall but at some key moments came across as too sweet and gentle for the part.  Yet by no means do they kill this film; it's bigger than they are.

Also:  excellent writing too.  I was impressed.

There's a reason this film remains a classic after over two decades.  Overall it's brilliant.  Someday I'll watch it again.

For those who don't know, this film follows a junior stock broker (played By Charlie Sheen) who idolises an investment genius Gordon Gekko (Douglas), he manages to manoeuvre his way under Gekko's wing and starts to learn just how ruthless you have to be to get ahead in the finance industry. He also learns there are some rather unscrupulous and unethical ways to get ahead as well and his inner conflict is what brings this film to a head. This has a good cast of established actors (which includes Charlie Sheens real life father, Martin Sheen, whom plays his dad), as well as many future up an coming stars and you even get a brief cameo from Oliver Stone, who is the director, as another stock broker. Essentially this film is all about the culture of greed on wall street during the eighties, but somehow there is something compelling about the wheeling and dealing and way the trades are manages. If anything this glamorises the finance industry rather than acts as a cautionary tale. All in all this is a well acted and directed film and although it feels a little dated now it still makes for two hours entertaining enough viewing.

1398094,5,B000056KQN,"Stone has made a sequel to his modern classic film. Before watching the new one, I wanted to remind myself of the old one.
 It is as fresh as ever. Gordon Gekko is a treasure trove of wise statements on the nature of capitalism. His speech to the shareholder assembly where he attacks the thieving management is brilliant and I never heard a better version of combining satire and serious analysis.
We all know the famous quote `Greed is good', but there is much more in it. I have never heard, so far, any voice that claimed that Gekko is not speaking plain, if self-serving truth. He is the personified damnation of a whole `profession': the locust in human shape. While nobody in his right mind will deny that the financial sector as a whole has an important part to play in modern society, it is equally obvious that Gekko's special branch of the financial industry is entirely destructive. It does not contribute, it is not after `win-win' situations, and it is pure robbery and warfare. Its philosophy is solidly based on zero sums: what we gain is your loss. Be a man and live with it!

The usual argument in defense of these predators is that they play a sanitary role in keeping economic evolution healthy, in the way lions keep antelope herds fit and healthy. Of course there is a grain of truth in that, one can't deny that investment bankers are able to scare the living daylight out of thieving managements. But more often than doing good, these two bunches of criminals will gang up and siphon the juice out of honest shareholders and the work force. Whatever happened to the sane if illusionary concept of stakeholder interest? At about the time of Wall Street, in the best Reagan years, it got totally bowled out of the arena by a deceptive version of shareholder interest, whereby the robber barons assume the speaker role for all shareholders, the majority of whom is not able to follow the process and gets shortchanged.

Of course in comparison to their successors in the 3rd millennium, good old Gekko's world during the Reagan years was nearly idyllic.

1398095,5,B000056KQN,"... on the 10-year-old release. I have the word of my local video-nook manager, and his opinion is supported by most of the reviewers. I rented, therefore, the older DVD, which I got to keep longer for the same rental fee. Here's my review based on that edition:

Yes, Little Pig, the Big Bad Wolf Does Eat Pork!
The Big Bad Wolf, in this fictional account of ruthless  criminal insider trading on Wall Street, is Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). The Little Pig is a young financial nobody named Charlie Fox (Charlie Sheen), who uses a lot of chutzpah and an accidental tip from his father to hook up with Gekko, whom he aspires to emulate. The father (Martin Sheen) is that rarity in modern America, an honest man who'd rather work productively than get rich quick. The year is 1985, Reagan is President, Greed is both patriotic and Divinely approved, and the stock market is bullish. 2% of Americans own 50% of all wealth, with two-thirds of that wealth inherited. Money, according to Gekko, is not 'made' but merely transferred to those who have the 'stuff' he has, the same 'stuff' he professes to see in young Fox. He will, of course, betray his naive protege when and if ....

It's the superb acting of Douglas and Sheen, and the taut directing of Oliver Stone, that make this film hugely successful as drama. Whether it fairly represents the ethical morass of high finance in America and the deplorable failure of American ideals, or rather unfairly caricatures the wizards of Wall Street who revitalized American business, has been a point of controversy ever since the film first appeared. Critics have derided Oliver Stone as a lefty extremist pursuing an anti-capitalist agenda. There ough to be a ""viewers' discretion"" warning on this film, I think; if all you know about the stock market is what you hear on TV and radio talk shows, you really aren't qualified to judge it except as entertainment. And believe me, it is entertaining.

Some of the people involved in making the film have asserted that Gekko's character was based on the real-life figure of Michael Milken, the Junk Bond KIng, who was convicted of securities fraud as a result of an investigation of insider trading in 1989. Other candidates for the prototype of Gekko include the disgraced Ivan Boesky, who delivered a famous speech extolling Greed at UC Berkeley in 1986 and who lived by that ideal to the hilt. It happens that I knew Michael Milken personally for a while; he was the close kin of an in-law of my wife. His family and my wife's family had been going to each other's Bar Mitzvahs for decades. Michael Milken was formidably quick-minded and cool-headed about greed, but he was neither as handsome nor as steely-blue menacing as Gekko. As a study of financial concupiscence, however, Gekko could well represent Milken.

And now? Gordon Gekko has remained an iconic figure, such a plausible portrayal of the archetypal Wall Streeter that many people think the film was based on true-life events. But here's the irony of political polarization in the USA: the same people who rave against Wall Street, who thoroughly believe that every broker and trader is another Gordon Gekko, are also the people who denounce Barack Obama's proposed regulations of banks and stock markets! and whose 'faith' in God-given free-market capitalism blindfolds them to the odious truth of Gordon Gekko's credo of selfishness.",1289779200,,3396,4.868512110726644

Oliver Stone's father might have been a Wall Street broker, but he didn't seem to have explained the name of the game to his son.  At the end of the movie, the plot goes totally berserk, when investment banker Gekko, the character played by Michael Douglas, is sent to jail, charged for trading with insider information by the SEC !  This is absurd.  Greed has never been illegal.  And to make my point, I will put this into a historical context, illustrated by real-life examples :

* In 1907 Morgan took advantage of a ""panic"" - orchestrated by New York banks - to take control of Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, buying this firm worth $ 700 million for only $ 30 million

* During the Great Depression, the personal wealth of Joseph P. Kennedy rised from $ 4 million in 1929 to $ 100 million in 1935.  He was not the only one.  John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Bernard Baruch, Henry Morganthau, all those Wall Street - by lack of a better word - ""investors"" seemed somehow to be ""wise"" enough to get out of the stock market just before the Crash...

* Just after the events of 9/11, we were informed that huge volumes of American Airlines stock were traded just before the events happened.  The SEC ""investigated"", and later ""classified"" everything !  Nice work, boys !

* In 2008, the criminal bankers of Wall Street, after making billions of dollars with junk bonds, all of a sudden were considered ""too big to fail"".  Instead of being sent to jail, they first got $ 700 billion ""Main Street money"" courtesy of Bush, followed by $ 787 billion by the hoax changer Obama, in 2009.  And at this very moment, dollars are being flooded into the economy by the Fed, obliging other central banks in the world to buy them in order not to revaluate their own currencies too much.

Let's never forget that the Fed is a privately owned organization.  To be more precise, owned by the Rockefeller and Morgan families, following the guidelines of ""mastermind"" Meyer Amschel Rothschild, who is claimed to have said : ""Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the law"".  This puts Wall Street and the Law into *real* perspective.

When partying, the power elite of Wall Street likes to make fun with the ignorance of Main Street.  When in 1863 the National Bank Act was voted in the US, Rothschild's investment firm in London sent a memo to an associated banker in New York, which stated : ""The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent upon its favors that there will be no opposition from that class while, on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending... will bear its burden without complaint.""

That was in 1863.  Nothing has changed since...

1398107,5,B000056KQN,"I was delighted to see that this film was available on my pay-per-view cable because I hadn't seen it when it first came out.

Briefly, Michael Douglas is an unscrupulous Wall Street tycoon who bends and breaks the law.  He takes young Charlie Sheen under his wing and we watch Charlie change his moral principles, grow rich, bed blond and beautiful Daryl Hannah and seem to become a younger version of his mentor.  But then, Michael Douglas goes too far when he tries to take over the airline that Charlie's father works for and Charlie has a change of heart.  All this is carried out at a breakneck speed and even though it is hard to follow the specific details of each deal, there is no problem following the concept, memorialized by the phrase ""greed is good"" which seemed to describe Wall Street back then in the eighties and especially describes it today.

Oliver Stone directed this film and his extreme talent made it a winner.  There are a million little special details that gives it a real ""zing"" and it is so fast paced that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  I look forward to seeing its sequel now, hoping that it will be as good.",1286064000,,1151,4.478468899521531
1398108,5,B000056KQN,"2 Disc Set - Insider Trading Edition, released September 7, 2010

Wallstreet was made in 1987 by writer and director Oliver Stone and starring Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, Darryl Hannah, and John C. McGinley. A young stockbroker after months of persistence finally bags the big fish, Gordon Gekko, a man whose presence and lifestyle he idolizes. He shuns his blue collar background in pursuit of greed and impatiently engages in illegal insider trading.

I first watched this movie after a book called ""Now Showing"" claimed it to be one of the best 25 movies....ever, I guess. I must say, all in all, it was a good movie. I actually really liked Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen's work in it and I believed their relationship. The pull of an actual father and son relationship really added to the authenticity of the roles. I finally got to see Michael Douglas just the way I like him -- being a bad guy, someone getting the best of him, and not seducing women.

Michael Douglas plays a big Wallstreet player who has money falling out of his eyeballs and is idolized by Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox. Fox is taught to bend and eventually break the rules to get ahead and get that cold hard cash. This movie is all about greed. Douglas' character likes to buy out the majority of shares in a company and then liquidate it getting away with a quick buck. When Douglas gets going into a lengthy monologue, he oozes confidence which is amazing considering the pressure he was under. Bud Fox grows a conscience when he sells out his father's company to this same fate and decides to fight against it ruining everything he's worked for. This was one of those roles that really made Charlie Sheen stand out and become a celebrity in his own right and brought the extra challenges of that responsibility with it.

There is an appearance by Darryl Hannah as random home decorating girlfriend who is very comfortable in her way of living and leaves Fox the first time it gets tough. I thought it would be more dramatic and more of a point of her being in the movie, but there really isn't and it ended up being a waste of screen time and just one more thing for him to lose on his fall from grace. She is a symbol of the rewards that can be earned by a fast way of living stepping on others and her substance is very shallow. Again I really loved seeing someone get the best of Michael Douglas, even if they couldn't get away scot-free and had to face the music. Shows the value of time, hard work, and morals over getting rich quick with some family values thrown in too.

Probably an undervalued asset to this film is one of my favorites, John C. McGinley whom you'll remember as one of the Bob's from Office Space and his role of Dr. Cox on Scrubs. Always there to heckle and mock his good friend and has some of the best one-liners in the movie. Actually three of the main five lines people quote from this movie can all be attributed to this character he developed.

This is especially a great movie for men and/or people who love business and stocks. This is one of my husband's all-time favorites and many men can quote it readily.

DVD Extras:

First, there is a new commentary by director, Oliver Stone. He is a precise fellow! Stories are told of how filming is going on and he isn't even looking through the camera, he is following along word for word in the script to make sure his actors don't miss a moment of his dialogue. Before Michael Douglas, Stone considered Warren Beatty and Richard Gere for the role of Gordon Gekko which both declined when the script was in an earlier form. Apparently Gere still wonders where his career would have gone if he had gotten the script that Michael Douglas got to shoot. Douglas had a heck of a time with the lines. There was so much to his monologues and dialogue and much was shot in long takes. When he finally put in the time and memorized his part better, he was able to put in the performance that was needed. The commentary reveals more behind-the-scenes information as well as Stone's apparently neurotic tendencies. So many times after a line is said, he commented on how so-and-so of some magazine or whatever complained about THAT line but why he justified it being important to the script. If he really was that confident behind each one, he probably wouldn't need to expain, right? He had a LOT of issues working with Darryl Hannah and in retrospect wouldn't have cast her in the role if he could do it over again.

On Disc 2, you can watch the entire film with a Trivia Track that pops up helpful facts like when it's Gekko's birthday that he is a Taurus and other facts that are actually interesting about the making of the film and New York and the stock exchange in general.

""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" is a very short few minute conversation with the main actors in the new film: Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, and Josh Brolin about their characters and new situations. ""Fox Legacy with Tom Rothman"" talks about a generation of men who took up ""Wall Street"" as something to be quoted and idolized Gekko, whom was intended to be a villain but was a hero to these young, hungry executives.

So really when it boils down to it, this version is just to make a few bucks with the new movie coming out and does not provide much that the 20th anniversary edition didn't out-do.",1285804800,,5364,4.50256937307297

1398111,4,B000056KQN,"It's pretty difficult to make the manipulation of stock prices interesting in a feature length movie, but Stone kind of pulls it off.  Charlie Sheen was mis-cast in the title role.  I liked Hal Holbrook's brief contributions as the worldly, elder stock broker.  Some of his lines are gems:  ""The thing about money is that it makes you do things you don't want to do.""  ""You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.""  ""I don't know where you get your information from son, but I don't like it.""  ""Man looks in the mirror.  There's nothing staring back at him except the abyss.  That's when man finds his character.""

Daryl Hannah's a good-looking blonde, but can't act her way out of a paper bag.  Martin Sheen is convincing as the left-leaning union leader and father.  Sean Young is over-the-top awful as Gordon Gekko's spoiled, phony wife.

Watched it on 9-11-10 so when you see the twin towers at the beginning of the film.

A film for it's time & it is Michael's movie for his Best Actor winner role.  His 2cd Oscar.
I am NOT a fan of Charlie Sheen never have been so of course I did not like him in this film.
Sean Young & Daryl Hannah after ""Blade Runner"" working together again, this time in the same scene.
Sean's character was a spoiled I do nothing let the servants do it trophy wife.  Hannah's character WAS NOT NEEDED IN THE FILM.
What was the point of this character?  To design Bud's new apartment with UGLY ART WORK & BAD COLOR PAINT.  Time could have been saved in NOT having this character in here-WAS NOT NEEDED.  DID NOTHING TO THE STORY.
And, of course, Sean & Daryl's movie career was pretty much over when the 1980's ended.
James Spader doing a James Spader role-done this bit how many times James?

Rereleased to promote the 2cd film.  Now Gordon is supposed to have a daughter in the new film, looks like a guy in a dress.  In this original film they have a son & the KID LOOKED NOTHING LIKE THEM.  Both of them were fit, the kid over weight.  Oliver Stone let this gaffe in the 2cd film to happen.  Bad job Oliver.

I like the film but this DVD is POOR.
Extras, what extras?  Where is a making of the film?  The extras are a joke but as long as they get to promote the new film....

And, no chapter list & IT HAS ONE OF THESE CHEAP PLASTIC DVD CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  THESE ARE CHEAP & CAN DAMAGE THE DVD'S.

No one seems to review movies mentioning the product's quality, ever. One thing is the movie and another thing is the product. First, the Blu-ray version is only about 10 to 15% better image than its normal DVD version. Second, on the back of the box it says 2.35:1 Widescreen presentation and when you play it, it is the same as the normal DVD, 1.85:1. Nice going Fox. Yes, there's a little bit more of Special Features, one more than the normal DVD version. So, if you are not a fanatic in quality and your pocket has been collecting moths for the past year or so, stick to your DVD version or get one used. I'm stuck with the Blu-ray version I bought and I can't return it. And thus, the movie is a 1985 preview of what, in a way, finally happened in America 24 years later.

1398122,4,B000056KQN,"Read these words spoken by Gordon Gekko and try to remember, if you can, when the world was different.

Gordon Gekko: ""The richest one percent of this country owns half our country's wealth, five trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulating to widows and idiot sons and what I do, stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. You got ninety percent of the American public out there with little or no net worth. I create nothing. I own. We make the rules, pal. The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval, the price per paper clip. We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody sits out there wondering how the hell we did it. Now you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy, are you buddy? It's the free market. And you're a part of it. You've got that killer instinct. Stick around pal, I've still got a lot to teach you. ""

Wall Street, the film, has reached its 20th anniversary. The film was first shown in 1987. The sights and the scenes have changed, but not Wall Street. We had a Senate Investigation two weeks ago and what did we learn? Wall Street is greedy and has the same mentality. Gordon Gekko or his facsimile is still in charge and the world is beating to his drummer. It was a little frightening to see Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas working their way through the streets and buildings of New York City. Making money, the name of the game. We all know the story, and we all know how it turns out. Except there is always someone to take their place. Time moves on. The most amazing part of the film for me was to see John C McGinley, he of 'Scrubs' in his younger days, and James Spader, he of ""Boston Legal'. Martin Sheen, Hal Holbrook, and Sean Young. Micheal Douglas, as the young, handsome and ruthless Gordon Gekko, won an Academy Award for his performance. Wonderful performances, all.

I urge everyone to see this film again. It is a wake-up, again!

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 05-03-10

I already owned this film on DVD, but upon aquiring my first HDTV, ""Wall Street"" was among the first five Blu-Rays I bought. This is one of my favorite films from the eighties, and were I simply reviewing the film itself it would unquestionably earn a solid five stars. Unfortunately, as I've discovered, the wise Blu-Ray consumer should seek out transfer reviews prior to buying, particularly on older titles.

Some eighties films, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road-Warrior/dp/B000OCZD5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Road Warrior""</a>, look so incredible on Blu it seems as if they were made yesterday.

The picture is slightly sharper on the Blu, but the difference between the two is almost entirely negligible.

If you don't own this film, definitely grab this Blu-Ray. The picture is quite good (though it's extremely grainy, even with noise reduction), the special features are nice, and it can often be found for only ten to twelve dollars. If you already own the previously mentioned two-disc release, there is absolutely no reason to double-dip. Trust me, you'll be disappointed!",1268006400,,1632,7.069306930693069
1398127,3,B000056KQN,"I liked several other Oliver Stone movies a lot and figured that with this great cast, that this would be an exciting film.  Perhaps it was better when it first appeared.  Now, we all know about the weaknesses of Wall Street greed so there's no surprise there.

Michael Douglas was good as the quintessential bad guy.  Martin Sheen was good as the quintessential good guy.  Charlie Sheen is the son, vacillating between the two, like Faust, wondering if he should sell his soul to the Devil or not.  Well, he does and, if he had been played by a better actor, we might care.  Perhaps Charlie has matured as an actor since this debut performance; I don't know because I've never seen him in anything since.  However here he is terrible.  I suspect that if he had not been his father's son, he never would have made it in the business.  I only wonder how such a good actor as Martin could have spawned such a bad actor as Charlie.  Well they both have good hair.

The problem with having such a poor actor as the guy who carries the whole film is that he never engages our sympathy.  He has no ability to do anything besides act cool, and that gets old real fast.  It was obvious from the first, that he was going to get burned in this deal and I kept thinking that it couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  As his father says in the end, maybe some jail time will do him good.

Darryl Hannah, who is very good in other films, is terrible here, too.  All in all, I can't recommend it.",1267747200,,1476,4.251798561151079

1398129,3,B000056KQN,"Director Oliver Stone has caught the ambitious feelings of a greedy time during the 1980's.  It is also a deja vu moment on steroids for the beginning of the 21st Century.  Greed and avarice versus human decency and the greater good is what the movie is about.

Set in New York City, Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, a striving, ambitious stockbroker, doing cold calls for his firm.  Bud is from a blue-collar background who has a hard-working union boss father.  He has a deep loving respectful relationship with him.  Martin Sheen plays Carl, Bud's father (he is also Charlie Sheen's father in real life)

Bud also admires and worships the success of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), who has much success in corporate takeovers.  He is rich and powerful beyond the normal bounds of Bud's expectations.

The story evolves to Bud being torn between two father figures, Gordon the Wall Street Wizard (""Greed is Good"") and Carl, his loving, kind and working class man.

As Gordon takes Bud on as his protg, he shows him the ""moves"" that need to be done to get to the top.  Bud slowly but surely decides that this is much more fun than doing cold calls for his firm.  Lou Mannheim (Hal Holbrook), who works for Bud's firm, counsels him that easy money is a dream.  You work hard and diligent through good and bad times and that is what works.  Bud ignores the advice and stays in the fast lane, using inside information from his father as well as getting a job in night cleaning to go through other people's files for insider information.

He moves up to an expensive apartment and a beautiful ambitious girlfriend to match (Darryl Hannah).  Gekko puts more and ore pressure on Bud to keep breaking the law of insider trading - and then undermine his union leader father, which will jeopardize his friend's jobs and lives, he can't do it.  Bud realizes that sleeping at night with a clear conscience is worth more than all the glitz and power money can buy.

The movie has some bumps (Darryl Hannah's acting is awful as the girlfriend), but performances by Michael Douglas, Martin and Charlie Sheen make it riveting and a compelling watch.  The bittersweet twist is that we still see greed and hubris in top Wall Street and Banking firms. No lessons learned.",1266883200,,2250,4.66497461928934

DVD Extras:

The first part of this review I wrote three years ago, but now I've gotten my hands on the 20th anniversary edition with special features and I want to gush about those for you. First, there is a new commentary by director, Oliver Stone. He is a precise fellow! Stories are told of how filming is going on and he isn't even looking through the camera, he is following along word for word in the script to make sure his actors don't miss a moment of his dialogue. Before Michael Douglas, Stone considered Warren Beatty and Richard Gere for the role of Gordon Gekko which both declined when the script was in an earlier form. Apparently Gere still wonders where his career would have gone if he had gotten the script that Michael Douglas got to shoot. Douglas had a heck of a time with the lines. There was so much to his monologues and dialogue and much was shot in long takes. When he finally put in the time and memorized his part better, he was able to put in the performance that was needed. The commentary reveals more behind-the-scenes information as well as Stone's apparently neurotic tendencies. So many times after a line is said, he commented on how so-and-so of some magazine or whatever complained about THAT line but why he justified it being important to the script. If he really was that confident behind each one, he probably wouldn't need to expain, right?

Also, there are two featurettes: ""Greed is Good"" and ""Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wallstreet"". Greed is Good focuses on what this movie meant to that audience in 1987 and how real brokers took it to heart and how some began to idolize Gekko as well and even asked Charlie Sheen to open accounts for them so they'd be able to say they had an account with Bud Fox. It's pretty entertaining to see how this became a bit of a bible and how every single day, this movie is quoted on the floor of the stock market. It is also brought up how tempting it is to try and take shortcuts in the business and what their field of work really means to brokers and their families. The Making of Wallstreet is based more in the behind-the-scenes information again and what it did for the careers of individual actors and what they struggled with. Darryl Hannah had issues with the development of her character and didn't believe women could be like that but Stone assured her that there are gold-diggers like that out there.

The deleted scenes are minimal and don't seem to add much to the movie. But I'd say the commentary and featurettes are great for fans of this movie. If you like this movie, you should also check out ""Boiler Room"". It has VERY similar themes, cutting corners, a father/son dynamic, and the actors even quote entire scenes from ""Wallstreet.""

With the sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps coming out on April 23rd this year, I'm very excited to see what has happened with Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko and his new protege played by Shia LaBeouf. Also Casey Mulligan who starred in one of this year's Best Picture nominees ""An Education"" will be making an appearance so I am looking forward to that!",1266796800,,6174,4.520143240823635

1398137,4,B000056KQN,"""Wall Street,"" the 1987 film directed by Oliver Stone is a MUST for any serious movie collector to own. It tells a tale that rings true more than twenty years after the film was first released. ""Wall Street"" is not a dumbed-down movie, reduced to appeal to the least common denominator. The viewer will have to pay close attention to appreciate the plot and the consequences of the actions undertaken onscreen. If you're a passive individual who wants simply to be told what to think, what to do, when to do it...viz., if you're a walking automaton with not a shred of consciousness, this movie is not for you. Go rent ""Troll 2,"" instead. However, if you are curious and thoughtful, if you're interested in questioning what lies within the hearts of people, then give ""Wall Street"" a try. You will be glad that you did. The script is intelligent and memorably quotable (""The illusion has become real and the more real it becomes the more desperately they want it.""). The actors (mostly) lend credence to their characters and run the gamut from the Machiavellian to the vapid to the nobly idealistic. The end result is a lifelike story that ponders the driving forces of human behavior. What makes people tick? Additionally, Stone's use of music is a big plus, particularly ""This Must Be The Place (Nave Melody)"" by the Talking Heads. Eminently apropos.

Why only four stars? My first quibble with ""Wall Street"" centers on Daryl Hannah as the conniving opportunist, Darien Taylor. My difficulty in accepting Hannah as Taylor lies not in her physical appearance but rather in that I feel the role required someone with more gravitas, an actor with a more forceful demeanor. I found Hannah's performance to be mild, too mild for the character's disposition. My only other criticism of ""Wall Street"" is the subtitle track. It is inaccurate, perhaps from the dense dialogue of the script, but inaccurate nevertheless. For those who utilize the subtitle feature when viewing, it's a sloppy detail attached to an otherwise fine film (NOTE: The subtitle remarks made in this review are for the original DVD release and may have been rectified in later iterations of the DVD.).

""Wall Street 2,"" is presently in production and I am filled with anticipation as well as trepidation about this upcoming second chapter. Oftentimes, it is difficult to equal, let alone exceed an initial performance, especially one as noteworthy as the original. I am concerned that the release of WS2 will detract from what can arguably be considered Oliver Stone's finest film. Fingers are crossed!",1261872000,,2569,4.930715935334873
1398138,5,B000056KQN,"""Wall Street"" is basically a condemnation of the ""go go"" era of the 1980s.  Prior to the early 1980s the Dow Jones Industrial Average had been rangebound between about 600 and 1000.  Suddenly it took off towards 2000 and never stopped.  Fortunes were made and lost. Corporations rose and fell.  Capitalism's ""creative destruction"" was in full swing.  When it was over, we had created the world we live in today.  In this film Michael Douglas plays corporate raider and greenmailer Gordon Gekko.  Budd Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a motivated young stockbroker who falls into Gekko's orbit with its promise of big money, beautiful women, and all the power that big money brings.  The only catch is, for Budd Fox this required him to engage in insider trading and selling out the company that his father works for.

This film includes numerous memorable scenes that have passed into folklore.  Gordon Gekko's ""Greed is Good!"" speech at a stockholder's meeting is a classic--brutal -- but it is also true, and more or less explains the competitive nature of capitalism.  Michael Douglas won a well-deserved Academy Award for his portrayal of the amoral and immoral Gordon Gekko.  Gekko has not only lost all sense of morality, but he has crossed the line and in the film he is systematically violating the law for stock market gains.

""Wall Street"" is a cautionary tale about losing sight of morality for money.  As such, it succeeds in conveying its message while at the same time being hugely entertaining.  Michael Douglas turns in a fantastic performance as Gordon Gekko, and Charlie Sheen is superb as Budd Fox.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent.

1398140,4,B000056KQN,"Hard to believe it's been over 20 years since the release of the movie that gave us the clever tag-line ""Greed is good.""

The now double-irony of that phrase could not really be foreseen except by a prophet or time traveler from the future we now inhabit.

Maybe greed is not so good.  Maybe the ideas of capitalism and democracy are not even fraternal twins from the same father.

What has gone wrong?

Take another look at this film with the hindsight that two decades provides.  There are clues.

Michael Douglas won an Oscar for playing a Donald Trump-like character perfectly named Gordon Gecko.  Gecko, like the namesake reptile, had an uncanny ability to stick to his prey until he absorbed it.

Martin Sheen is a young trader who worships Gecko.  He's the apprentice to the sorcerer.  But in the end, discovers the real cost of selling one's soul.

But have we as a nation reached that nadir?  What is there at the bottom of the well of greed?

Oliver Stone and Michael Douglas are committed to ""Wall Street II.""

But what would make an even better story is the turning point in Bernie Madoff's life when he made that first theft from an investor, told the first lie and put his hand back in his own pocket.  It could be the ""Citizen Kane"" of the 21st Century.  After all, the money Madoff made off with is greater than the wealth of publisher Randolph Hearst, the purported character on which Kane was based.  But what's Madoff's ""Rosebud""?

1398144,5,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is a cinematic masterpiece by Oliver Stone and Stanley Weiser; and when they say that the casting was well done they mean it! Michael Douglas in particular gives the performance of a lifetime as the villain Gordon Gekko; and there should be heaps of praise to this very day for Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, a young, inexperienced and overeager to make money stockbroker who allows himself to be corrupted by Gekko for the sake of the almighty dollar. The plot moves along at a very good pace and the cinematography was excellent. The quality of the print is superlative and if you get the 20th Anniversary Edition there is a bonus disc with a plethora of extras!

When the action starts, we meet some people at a stock brokerage film; and the younger ones who have fewer accounts and who need to build up their client base work in the mayhem of what was called ""the pit"" in real life at the time this movie was made. We meet Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) and his buddy Marvin (John C. McGinley) as they try to talk anyone into buying some stock or options or any financial vehicle so they can make a commission and pay the bills. Bud's father Carl (Martin Sheen, Charlie's father in real life) is not terribly happy that his son is a stockbroker; and he encourages Bud to give up being a ""salesman."" Moreover, some of the older, more mature stockbrokers like Lou (Hal Holbrook) adhere to the value of being patient to get ahead in life. But Bud is hungry--REALLY hungry--and he calls the famously wealthy Gordon Gekko 59 days in a row in order to get Gordon's business.

Finally, Bud does get at least some of Gordon's business and with it comes ""perks"" including drugs and women. Unfortunately, it also draws Bud into a world where trades are based entirely on insider information which Bud knows is illegal. Bud's greed, however, is so great that he joins forces with Gekko and sticks with him to get as much as he can for himself. Gekko even sets Bud up with a woman Bud really begins to have feelings for; Darien Taylor (Daryl Hannah) was herself made rich by Gekko and Darien begins to return Bud's affection for her.

The plot can go anywhere from here. Bud's father Carl works at Blue Star Airlines, a small carrier that was built up from the ground with hard work and honest values. Gekko, however, thinks that he and Bud can do a better job of running the airline--where might this lead? How will Bud's father Carl react to this? And what about Bud's loyalty to Gekko--will it always be there or will there eventually be a conflict of interest--and how might that play out? No plot spoilers here, folks--watch and find out!

The 20th Anniversary Edition includes a second DVD with impressive bonus features. We get an optional audio commentary by co-writer and director Oliver Stone; a 60 minute  documentary about the film entitled ""Greed Is Good;"" a number of deleted scenes and a making of featurette entitled """"Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wall Street."" Excellent!

Wall Street is a powerful film that explores greed and the very high price that can be paid for living a life consumed by gluttony and materialism. This sent quite a strong message during the materialistic 1980s in America. This is definitely a morality film largely crafted by Oliver Stone; and it remains memorable after you watch it. It's not quite as stunning as Stone's movie ""Platoon"" but it succeeds very well without a doubt; and I highly recommend this film.",1244419200,,3454,4.63562091503268
1398145,4,B000056KQN,"The SEC in this 1980's film is far more effective than the SEC of 2008, but this is a film and the SEC was pretty much worthless back then too. Trust is the basis for business, not greed. When you can't trust financial statements, CEO and executives consistently lie, and you reward incompetence then the system fails.

You look at a movie like WallStreet and realize not much is different from the 80's. The cycles repeat, there is no limit to human greed, it is far easier for a good person to go bad than a bad person to ever go good and it is a bit depressing.

It's funny looking at Wall Street with the green text monitors, brick cell phones, 80's style excess, and everything is dated, but you also realize the movie's story and warnings are the same today in 2009.",1243209600,,772,4.354166666666667

1398147,5,B000056KQN,"In 1987 OLIVER STONE again starred Charlie Sheen, this time as Bud Fox, along with Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas, in ""Wall Street"". Stone, like Coppola's ""Patton"", tapped into a part of America he really wanted to discredit, but instead glorified. Based on the go-go stock markets of the Reagan '80s, it is loosely based on inside arbitrageurs and junk bond kings like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Fox/Sheen is an idealistic, ambitious young stockbroker, his father is his conscience, and Douglas as Gordon Gekko is pure tantalizing temptation. Fox must violate SEC laws and get inside information in order to do business with the ""big elephant"" Gekko. Gekko's star fades when a big deal-gone-bad has personal ramifications, and Fox turns a dime on him. The film is supposed to show that America is a greedy place that ""produces nothing"" in a ""zero sum game"" in which the rich only make money on the backs of the poor. Gekko's (Stone's) statements about economics are pure, unadulterated economic lies shown to be lies simply by?observing factual things. Where Stone may have had second thoughts was the reaction the film got. As the years went by, he and others were approached countless times by Young Republicans and Wall Street execs who told him the depiction of the exciting world of finance led them into that very career, which they thanked him for! Stone had hoped to create an egalitarian class. Instead, he created a decade full of Gordon Gekkos. They in turn fueled the dot-com boom. It was not unlike the Democrats who hoped to expose Oliver North and the Republicans in the Iran-Contra ""scandal,"" only to discover that millions thought Ollie and his White House pals were doing God's work in fighting Communism.

1398151,4,B000056KQN,"Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" chronicles the rise of unbridled greed, of reckless gambling with the other people's money, of soulless financiers whose God is cash.  Some of the details are dated now -- the opening shots of the World Trade Towers, the IBM dumb terminals everywhere, Motorola ""brick"" wireless phones, the dollar amounts thrown about as astronomical in 1985 -- but the story behind the details and the motivations of the characters are as good a lesson as you're going to find.  As a matter of fact, in the extras it is revealed that the director and cast used Bear Stearns as the model for their portrayals.  How ironic then that the tagline for the film, ""Greed is good,"" should end up eulogizing the era of narcissistic excess that the movie portrays.",1226793600,,767,4.795454545454546
1398152,4,B000056KQN,"The film is a cornerstone for the 80's decade, as it embodies the excessive greed that was typical of this time period. The film was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma and BD30K Blu-Ray player. The PQ was not excellent, especially in darker scenes-it contained significant grain and noise, but adequate to enjoy as a hi-def film-3.5/5. The AQ was not overwhelming, but sounds and music were correct for each seen, strong throughout-4/5. Overall quality of transfer for picture and sound 3.5/5.

The ambitious Bud Fox rises to the top under the guidance of a ruthless business man who cuts corners and cuts throats to get ahead. The materialism often documented in the 80's appears full throttle, and all characters in the film, except the token reminder of morality-Bud's Dad, are all infected with the greed. The film is an interesting portrayal of the time period, but also how a person's character can become compromise. The average person could fall prey to glitz and glamor of this ""no limits"" life style.

In Stone's typical stylistic manner, he executes the film and story arc of the rise and fall of Bud Fox in a well timed manner. In the end Gecko still prevails, despite of his tactics, but it is Bud who saves his father's company, albeit inadvertently being punished for the route the initially chose.

I was in my teens in the 80's, and the decade holds a certain fascination for me. The film is one of my favorites of the era, and is definitely worth seeing. It is not crushed by the same over the top humor and kitch that is present in some of the more light-hearted 80's films, but instead is a more conscious-grabbing serious character examination of the era, and the effect on character that limitless ""aquisition"" of materialism can cause.

The film is still relevant today, as it seems this greed is still present in our society, and has become an accepted norm and side effect of our capitalistic society. Performances are solid throughout and further/introduce careers of interesting actors, including James Spader.",1226448000,,2036,4.841954022988506
1398153,4,B000056KQN,"Writer-director Oliver Stone aptly depicts the culture of corporate greed and those who lead that rat pack in an exploration of the morality of placing profits over people.

Michael Douglas does a superb job in portraying corporate raider Gordon Gecko, a 1980s-era, larger-than-life figure who will stop at nothing to quench his thirst professionally and personally. Charlie Sheen is the young Wall Street broker who beats the odds to become a protege of this iconic figure, but becomes entwined in a web trust, truth and doing the right thing with his blue-collar father, played by Martin Sheen.

The white-collar party seems to have no end, as those willing to play the game by day will be rewarded with riches that millions can only dream about.

Some young people take him as a role model. He was clearly not supposed to be, but look at another Oliver Stone film, Natural Born Killers, and the same thing happened there. Oliver Stone takes chances in his films, and though they don't always turn out the way he plans, you have to admire the man. This film in particular really captured an era, and he showed tremendous foresight, in fact it was released in 1987, just before one of the biggest stock market melt-downs in history that happened in October of that year. It also shows the power of information, and even though that information is used to manipulate the market and destroy companies, it truly does foreshadow The Information Age. It is quaint to see the crude graphics on the screens of the computers they used, but what insight it showed into what power would be unleashed by the information displayed there.

So, this movie is enjoyable on these two levels, as entertaining drama, and as a serious message about money, capitalism, and the rampant greed of the late 80s, but it is also entertaining just for the behind the scenes drama of the people in it.

First, there is a very strong father/son element to Wall Street. Oliver Stone's father, Louis Stone, was a big trader on Wall Street. The film is dedicated to him. And, Oliver Stone's own son, Sean Stone, plays one of Gordon Gekko's children. Oliver Stone was himself a Vietnam veteran, and he had cast Charlie Sheen in Platoon, a big success for them both just the year before. After Wall Street, he would make another Vietnam film, Born on the Fourth of July, but instead of casting Charlie as promised, Tom Cruise would get the role. Stone didn't even bother to tell him, which led to a falling out and they have never worked together since.

Charlie Sheen's father, Martin Sheen, played Charlie's character's dad, Carl Fox. Charlie was Bud Fox. Father and son both had big success playing soldiers in Viet Nam, and both would have near-death experiences while making them. While filming Apocalypse Now the elder Sheen suffered a heart attack, and while filming Platoon, the younger Sheen almost fell out of a helicopter. I will revisit the father/son theme later when I discuss Michael Douglas, but back to the Sheen's for now. A lot of the drama of Wall Street revolves around the father/son relationship. Bud Fox's dad works for an airline, and he is hard working and honest. Bud uses inside information gleaned from his father to win favor with Gordon Gekko, who uses that information to gain control of the airline, and then try to wreck it and sell off the pieces. This betrayal is the pivotal point of the whole movie.

Martin Sheen's real name is Ramon Antonio Gerard Est&eacute;vez. He is part Irish, and part Spanish, and enjoys being Spanish almost as much as he does being Irish, and he really enjoys being Irish. Though he has played President of the United States at least 4 times, perhaps most memorably as President Jed Bartlett on the long running TV series The West Wing, in real life he is a life long political activist who has been arrested at protests over 70 times. He also knows all the lyrics and can sing every song that was ever sung by Frank Sinatra. In addition to Charlie, 3 of his other children are also actors. Emilio Est&eacute;vez is Charlie's older brother, and 2 others go by the Est&eacute;vez name. But those who know him say that he is closest to his son, Charlie. ""No father could ever be prouder of his son,"" said, Sheen, the Elder.  ""I hold Charlie's accomplishments dearer than my own. He has been through so much and overcome so much more. Even if he weren't my son he'd still be my best friend.""

Charlie Sheen's real name was Carlos Irwin Est&eacute;vez. He was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City. He was born a ""blue baby,"" and the doctor who saved him was named Irwin, and hence the middle name. Though he was only 2 years old when Danny O'Keefe wrote ""Good Time Charlie's Got the Blues"" in 1967, it really could have been written about him. One of his nick names is Good Time Charlie, and the other is The Machine, which is partly due to his name being Sheen. At the trial of Heidi Fleiss he testified under oath that he spent over $50,000 on her high priced call girls. He is a notorious womanizer, boozer, and druggie, who has perhaps finally settled down, at least with regards to drugs and booze. At one point he almost died of a cocaine overdose, and he was in and out of rehab. Once he checked in for only a day.

""One of my fondest memories is when Slash, from Guns N' Roses, sat me down at his house and said, `You've got to clean up your act.' You know you've gone too far when Slash is saying, `Look, you've got to get into rehab, you have to shut it down. You're going to die.' He's a terrific guy and I love him, he's a buddy of mine, but I had to step back from that situation and go, `Yeah, but you're Slash. Whaddya mean?' We'd been up for about four days. But I still heard him because a part of me was saying, `This isn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be. Something's missing.'""

Platoon and Wall Street are so far his best film roles, but he has settled into a cozy career as a sit com actor, first on Spin City, and currently on Two and a Half Men, which is already in syndication, playing reruns twice a day Monday through Friday, while still making fresh episodes. The character is loosely based on himself, though one would think it is a very much watered down version. As with his role in Spin City, his characters always seem to be named Charlie.

Continuing the father/son theme, actor Michael Douglas is the son of well-known actor Kirk Douglas. The elder Douglas is best known for his role as Spartacus.

""I am Spartacus.""

Michael Douglas had a breakthrough role as Inspector Steve Keller on the TV cop series The Streets of San Francisco. He played opposite veteran actor Karl Malden. He played some comedies and even played Zach in the movie version of A Chorus Line before playing in Fatal Attraction, in 1987, the same year as Wall Street, and Basic Instinct, in 1992. Recently there was a series on NPR (National Public Radio) of the most memorable characters from film and fiction, and Gordon Gekko was profiled. Premiere Magazine had a list of the 100 most memorable characters from film, and Gordon Gekko was #25. Michael Douglas won an Oscar for the role. Besides being married to the much younger (25 years) Catherine Zeta-Jones, his role as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street will no doubt be his legacy:

Gordon Gekko: If you need a friend, get a dog.

Gordon Gekko: The most valuable commodity I know of is information.

Gordon Gekko: Greed captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.

Gordon Gekko: I look at a hundred deals a day. I pick one.

Gordon Gekko: Lunch is for wimps.

Gordon Gekko: You're walking around blind without a cane, pal. A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place.

Gordon Gekko: Ever wonder why fund managers can't beat the S&P 500? 'Cause they're sheep, and sheep get slaughtered.

Gordon Gekko: [at the Teldar Paper stockholder's meeting] Well, I appreciate the opportunity you're giving me Mr. Cromwell as the single largest shareholder in Teldar Paper, to speak. Well, ladies and gentlemen we're not here to indulge in fantasy but in political and economic reality. America, America has become a second-rate power. Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. Now, in the days of the free market when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the stockholder. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the men that built this great industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today, management has no stake in the company! All together, these men sitting up here own less than three percent of the company. And where does Mr. Cromwell put his million-dollar salary? Not in Teldar stock; he owns less than one percent. You own the company. That's right, you, the stockholder. And you are all being royally screwed over by these, these bureaucrats, with their luncheons, their hunting and fishing trips, their corporate jets and golden parachutes.
Cromwell: This is an outrage! You're out of line Gekko!
Gordon Gekko: Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell, Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over 200 thousand dollars a year. Now, I have spent the last two months analyzing what all these guys do, and I still can't figure it out. One thing I do know is that our paper company lost 110 million dollars last year, and I'll bet that half of that was spent in all the paperwork going back and forth between all these vice presidents. The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be survival of the unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right or you get eliminated. In the last seven deals that I've been involved with, there were 2.5 million stockholders who have made a pretax profit of 12 billion dollars. Thank you. I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them! The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind. And greed, you mark my words, will not only save Teldar Paper, but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA. Thank you very much.

Gordon Gekko: Greed is good.

This movie also had some other interesting characters/actors and character actors. John C. McGinley plays Marv, one of the other stock traders who works alongside Bud Fox. He is familiar as Dr. Perry Cox, the anti social doctor on TV sit com Scrubs. And Hal Holbrook is working there, too. Sylvia Miles plays a crass Real Estate Agent. She was nominated for an Oscar for Midnight Cowboy, and has been on the Hollywood/New York party scene for like ever. The best line about her was when someone name dropped that she would be at an art gallery opening, someone, can't remember who but if anyone does, please help me provide them with the proper credit, quipped: ""Sylvia Miles would go to the opening of an envelope."" James Spader (Sex, Lies & Videotape) plays a lawyer friend of Bud's. He currently plays a lawyer on Boston Legal. Daryl Hannah plays a designer who is Bud's girlfriend, once he starts making money. She is secretly in bed with Gekko, though. Her biggest tabloid moment was when she was a back-up singer and girlfriend to Jackson Browne, and he allegedly got rough with her. Then John F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly came to her rescue. Daryl's breakout role was as the acrobatic, beautiful replicant Pris in Blade Runner (1982); Pris was the vixen who wanted to live beyond her allotted years.

Segue to Sean Young, who was also in Blade Runner. What a classic movie, and was she ever great in it. I have always liked her, but she seems to attract ugly rumors like a magnet. She plays Kate Gekko in Wall Street, Gordon's wife. Her role was bigger at first, but during filming she rubbed Oliver Stone the wrong way. Whether that story is true or false, she is barely on screen long enough to register.

In 1988, Young appeared in The Boost with James Woods. Woods later sued her for harassing both him and his then-fianc&eacute;e, alleging that Young left a disfigured doll on his doorstep in addition to other disruptive behavior. Young denied the allegations and claimed that Woods filed the lawsuit out of spite. Young stated, ""It was a crush being turned down, that's all.... So sue me! And he [Woods] did."" The suit was settled out of court in 1989.

In 1989, she was cast as Vicki Vale in Tim Burton's Batman. During rehearsals, she broke her arm after falling off a horse and was replaced by Kim Basinger. In an unsuccessful attempt to win the role as Catwoman (which ultimately went to Michelle Pfeiffer) in the sequel Batman Returns, Young constructed a homemade Catwoman costume and attempted to confront director Tim Burton and actor Michael Keaton during production.

Young was fired from the 1990 movie Dick Tracy. Cast as Tess Trueheart, she was officially fired for not appearing maternal in the role. Young later claimed she was fired because she rebuffed Warren Beatty's advances (a claim Beatty denies).

Sean Young appeared in Fatal Instinct, a parody of both Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction--take that, Michael Douglas.

In January 2008, Young checked herself into rehab for alcohol abuse the day after an outburst at the Directors Guild of America awards in Los Angeles. Young was removed from the awards ceremony after repeatedly heckling director Julian Schnabel, who was onstage giving his remarks regarding his Best Director nomination for his work on the film, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.

I hope Sean Young recovers from her problems. But if Charlie Sheen could do it, so can she.

Even as we speak a writer is working on a sequel to Wall Street. Oliver Stone isn't involved, but Michael Douglas has agreed to reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The title, which was used already for a documentary about the making of Wall Street, is Money Never Sleeps.

1398165,4,B000056KQN,"Upon the moment of arrival I popped it into the Blu-ray player, eager to see how the transfer to HD faired. All in all, a decent transfer. The audio could have been remastered in some parts where it's clear there were some audio issues in the original (uneven volume, out of sync with actors...both those were in the original film though). The open and closing credits look like they were shot with a dirty camera lens, barely conveying the idea it *might* have been an ""artistic choice"", but the rest of the film looks pretty good. The film grain is definitely visible, but not to the point where it's intrusive or gives the impression it was a bad transfer.

The movie is a great one and the extras are a great addition to this HD upgrade. A documentary talks about the making of the film (and the inter-personal conflicts between the actors...Daryl Hannah was very unhappy with her role and Sean Young clashed with Charlie Sheen so much they had to be separated).

This is one of those rare movies I could watch over and over again, and/or rewind a scene to watch it a couple of times more. That especially applies to the montage of frenzied traders, where Stone makes a brief cameo. There are many visual subtleties, from camera perspectives to item inclusion, that a less talented filmmaker would happen on only by luck. It's a shame the theatrical version cut out the extras on the 20th anniversary DVD; not a frame was wasted. Well, I take that back: the obligatory bed scene with Bud and Darien. I don't say that because I'm a prude, but because it didn't add anything to the story.

It's nothing new to say that Michael Douglas gave the performance of a lifetime -- perhaps anyone's lifetime. Martin and Charlie Sheen, the latter noticeably less muscled than later years, also gave strong performances that were Oscar-worthy. Also of note is Hal Holbrook, who I wish had more lines. However, it fits with the story: if his character had had more time with Bud before the latter got in too deep, Bud wouldn't have needed the shocks of the liquidation meeting and his father's heart attack.

Simply a masterpiece of a movie.",1199059200,,1261,4.671171171171171
1398168,5,B000056KQN,"I am the CEO of a big company and although I of course never would do some of the things that go on in this movie, its the kind of movie that gets your business blood pumping!

It was bringing back old memories so I bought him and I each the 20th anniversary edition!  What a classic!  Its everything you wish you could do but never would!

Put Michael Douglass with Charlie and Martin Sheen and its a great entertaining movie!  First half is priceless with young Bud (Charlie) trying to land the big Whale (Douglas as Gordon Gecko).  Greed eventually crosses the line the end is predictable but there is a very good reason why so many businessmen love this movie!  Having Daryl Hannah nude in a bedroom scene with Charlie is a ""bonus"" guy track!

Give it with Boiler Room as a great one two punch since Boiler Room has a fantastic scene of those actors (Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi) watching Wall Street on TV and acting it out in Vin's living room word for word.

1398169,5,B000056KQN,This movie is my all-time favorite.  The snappy quips and memorable quotes are the features of a very well-written and well-acted movie.  Michael Douglas as Gordon Gekko is one of the great all-time movie characters.  This movie epitomizes how greed was interwoven into the Wall Street scandals of the 1980's.  Oliver Stone's depiction of this time in American history is extremely well done.  The extras in this DVD give the viewer a behind-the-scenes look at the actors and the legacy of this classic film.

And then, before Bud Fox knows it, he finds his luck taking a turn around the corner. This is when he snares his biggest client, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). Gordon Gekko is a corporate raider,with a high rolling career. If you are on Wall Street and you find yourself with clients like Gordon Gekko,you are destined for success.

But,behind closed doors,Gordan Gekko is a man that people don't know. Once Bud Fox discovers this, working under Gekko is going to be a strainlessly and fearful experience that will be hard to escape.

""Wall Street"" is a film that defines the word ""perfect"". From watching ""Wall Street"",one is shown how Wall Street works as a business and the dangers of working there. At the same time,""Wall Street"" never fails to represent its fiction. ""Wall Street"" is suspenseful and keeps one wondering what will happen next. The impeccable character chemistry(brought to life by comprehensive acting)move the film along well and balance out the suspense and regular,everyday drama of the film. At the same time,""Wall Street"" pays homage to the 80's,showing what the whole ""scene"" in the 80's was about and documenting the technology of the 80's(as far as cell phones and computers are concerned). Add all of that together with some of the most ravishing film cinematography that you will ever find,and you have the perfect and ideal film out of ""Wall Street"".

Having the 20th Anniversary Edition of ""Wall Street"" on DVD is a real treat. Sure,Oliver Stone's commentary and the ""Money Never Sleeps:The Making of Wall Street"" documentary have been carried over. But,you do have the weight of the bonus feautures that are to be found on ""Wall Street"",whether it is learning more about the making of it(Oliver Stone's commentary and ""Money Never Sleeps:The Making of Wall Street""),learning how the actors in this film feel about the financial world themselves(""Greed is Good""),or getting deleted scenes,along with commentaries for them and a(seperate)introduction by Oliver Stone. So,enjoy the bonus feautures,and don't worry about whether about originality or the act of recycling when going through them.

His father, Lou Stone, had been a stockbroker on Wall Street in New York City and this film was a son's way of paying tribute to his father. Almost twenty years later, it has become one of the quintessential snapshots of the financial scene in the United States and epitomizes the essence of capitalism, greed and materialism that was so prevalent in the 1980s.

Michael Douglas owns the role of Gekko and by extension dominates the movie with his larger than life character. He gets most of the film's best dialogue and delivers it with such conviction. There is a scene between Bud and Gekko in a limousine where he tells the younger man how the financial world works, how it operates and lays it all out, pushing Bud hard to go into business with him. It is one of the strongest scenes in the movie because you really believe what Gekko is saying and how Bud could be seduced by his words.

The culmination of Douglas' performance is his much lauded, often quoted, ""Greed is good"" speech that his character gives to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. He concludes by saying, ""Greed is right; greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms, greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge -- has marked the upward surge of mankind and greed, you mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the U.S.A."" This is one of the best delivered monologues ever put to film as Douglas goes from charming to downright threatening and back again, succinctly summing up the essence of '80 capitalism and greed.

The original DVD did not have many extras but the quality of what was included was excellent. They have all been carried over to this new release (minus the trailers) but do the new extras really merit a double dip?

There is an audio commentary by co-writer and director Oliver Stone. Stone talks about Michael Douglas' early struggles with the huge amount of dialogue he had to deliver and how he dealt with it. The filmmaker is candid with his shortcomings and those of others (i.e. Daryl Hannah, Charlie Sheen, etc.). As always, Stone delivers the goods, offering all kinds of fascinating insights into the making of the film.

The second disc features a new introduction by Oliver Stone that is brief and really should have been put on the first disc.

Another new extra is ""Greed is Good,"" an hour-long retrospective documentary with Hal Hoolbrook, John C. McGinley, Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas amongst others returning to offer their impressions of the financial world depicted in the movie. This substantial doc examines the appeal of Gekko and why he inspired people in the business world.

Also new to this edition is over 20 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Stone. There is a nice little scene with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller as one of Bud's clients. Also included is an earlier scene where Bud and Darian (Hannah) meet in a bar but Stone cut it because the Hamptons scene at Gekko's house was stronger. The filmmaker puts all of these scenes into context and why there were cut.

Finally, carried over from the original edition is ""Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wall Street,"" a top-notch, 47-minute making of documentary. There is very little overlap with the ""Greed is Good"" documentary.

If you're a fan of this film and already own the previous edition, the new extras definitely warrant a double dip. They are quite substantial in nature and shed more light on this excellent film.",1189728000,,3878,4.98145285935085

1398176,5,B000056KQN,"Wall Street, 1989 film

The film begins by showing men at work at dawn, and other people going to work. It shows the escalator at the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Stockbrokers are cold calling people to get them to buy the stocks that are being pushed in a Bull market. The stock market matches buyers to sellers. Financier Gordon Gekko knows how to profit from bad news. Bud Fox, a seller of stock, explains himself to his father (who knows of an unannounced FAA ruling). Will Bud use this inside information to better himself? Is it legal?

Bud visits Gekko in a bid to move up in the world of high finance. Stocks are traded like baseball cards. Bud gets an order to buy a stock for Gekko. There are rewards for those who can pick winners in the stock market. Information is a valuable commodity, it can win battles. Bud shadows a British financier to learn what he is doing in NYC. This news causes Gekko to start buying shares in an Ohio steel company. Others also buy this stock, doubling its price. That night Bud visits the Gekko home. Sir Larry also visits Gekko to make an tender offer for Gekko's holdings. Gekko is also a shrewd investor in commodities like works of art. But takes a job with a maintenance company to allow him to snoop at other companies. [This is what the Watergate burglars did.] Bud's new found wealth allows him to pay back his debts, and then move to a new apartment in the East Side. He is also promoted for his increased sales; another salesman is let go because his didn't meet his quota. Life is sweet. Gekko's lawyer explains how Bud is to deposit money in an offshore bank in the Cayman Islands. There will be no traceable links to Gekko.

The ""Stock Watch"" group noted how Teldar was in play. Will Gekko buy it to split it up and sell off its parts? Is a company run to benefit its managers and workers or its owners? If ownership is widely distributed then management has a free hand to reward itself. What happens to an ""over-funded pension fund""? [Does this explain the loss of pensions after the 1990s?] This film explains how new owners can profit by cutting wages for its workers and using this money to buy the company! Bud has a plan to save Bluestar Airlines; can it work? There is a dramatic scene between Bud and his father. Gekko has control of the shares, he can make more money quicker by breaking up Bluestar and selling off the pieces. [This allows bigger companies to eliminate competition and then raise their prices.] Gekko will also profit from looting the pension fund. The SEC is on their trail, they bring down the curtain on these financial looters. The dramatic ending is very ironic, Bud learned how to make a deal when it counts.

This story is loosely based on the ""junk bonds"" used to buy up and sell off businesses in the 1980s. Decreased Federal regulation allowed this. This film was completed before the October 1987 crash. You can learn how wealth is created when rich financiers know when to buy and sell.

When 1% of the people own half the wealth in a country what is the end result?

1398177,5,B000056KQN,"""Wall Street"" is a movie that seems to spark much debate. Basically, it is the working out of a moral struggle within young Wall Street trader Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) between the values with which he was raised of hard work and success through actual creation, versus those of his mentor Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) who succeeds through corporate raiding and ""creative destruction"". From Bud's viewpoint his dad's (Martin Sheen) roadmap for success and happiness seems old-fashioned to the point of being prehistoric compared to Gekko's, until Gekko sets his sights and his wrecking ball on his father's company, and Bud is forced to choose. Many people associate this with a liberal versus conservative viewpoint on business, a wild-west economy versus a planned economy and relegate this film to 1980's era nostalgia, like the now humorously giant cell phone Gekko is talking on as he walks along the beach. It is said that neither extreme works and that we've gradually settled towards something in the middle. However, the Gekkos of this world are smarter than that, and over the past 20 years have set up an economic system that serves them well. What we now have is a situation where the haves and have-mores have a planned - almost Soviet - system in which the rules stratify them at the top. I cite the changes in bankruptcy law as exhibit A. The labor force that serves them, however, are in the wild-west economy that was once advocated for everyone. Some will rise to the stratified top in this situation, but the vast majority will remain at the bottom shooting it out with each other - for scarce good jobs, good health care, education, etc. Thus, to me, Wall Street is just an opening chapter in the saga of how economic forces and attitudes toward them have changed, not the portrait of a 20 year-old fad that has come and gone.

1398178,1,B000056KQN,"Maybe this was a good film in 1987, but by today's standards it is god awful.  The only entertainment value comes from watching Michael Douglas talk on a cell phone the size of a shoe, then later he's amazed by a handheld television set.  Other than that small amount of nostalgia, this is a horribly acted, poorly written, cliche filled mess.  I cannot understand the positive reviews this gets, even by late 1980s standards.  If you really want to hear some terrible dialogue, just watch the part when the union boss walks into Douglas' office.  I thought I was watching a cheesy John Wayne impression.

Subtle it's not, but then neither was the time, nor its players. Director Stone (whose father was a broker) expertly evokes the dizzying altitude of the mega-wealthy, and young Sheen is perfectly cast as a misguided but willing pawn in a high-stakes game that feels too good to be true--and is.

1398181,5,B000056KQN,"The film avoids  as much as possible the sentimental side of things and concentrates on the financial depth of the business. There is a slight touch of romanticism with the cover-girl, sorry home decorator. There is a little bit more feeling with the father, maybe because the father is playing the father and the son is playing the son, though it remains essentially business, in this case union business. Then there is nothing but buying and selling, owning and dumping, saving and killing, and the  game is only pleasant if it is always both together. To kill one by saving another and to buy one in order to make the other sell and then buy him out. Even the police and justice are used that way. I expose you to the police to humiliate you and have you arrested, but then you trap me for the police with a tape-recorder and you will get a rap on the fingers from the judge while I will get to prison. When you know that that I was the one who wanted to kill a certain company that that you decided to save by having it bought by the sworn enemy of that I, you understand what inside business and inside dealing and inside embezzling and inside anything you want means. Just read or watch American Psycho, Unrated Version, and you will have the schizophrenic reading of the same situation. This film is maybe slightly too technical, but it is the way we are totally messed up in our lives by a bunch of psychopaths who have enough money to buy the federal government out of the federal reserve at Fort Knox, or vice versa, which might even be funnier. As Gekko said so simply: ""You're not naive enough to think we are in a democracy. It's the free market."" And we are the bait to catch the fish or the fish caught by the hook, or even maybe nothing but the hook itself to catch the shark.

1398182,5,B000056KQN,"Oliver Stone is one of my favorite ""Hollywood"" filmmakers, and I have enjoyed many of his movies over time.  While I haven't seen a few of his works, he has given more than his share of fine cinema from his beginnings, and I count ""Platoon,"" ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" ""JFK,"" and ""Nixon"" as among his better efforts, and I applaud and repeatedly watch parts of all of these.  However, to me, Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" is, overall, his best.

For one thing, it avoids a lot of the overlength and filler in many of his other films, as well as his sometimes uncomfortable mixture of fact and fiction/speculation.  ""Wall Street"" is pretty much a standard length and mainstream studio production, and while, as in almost all Stone films, it has a message to preach, in this one, he goes for a much lighter, more obscure, and subtle but just as powerful approach.  And while this is fiction, and does not really deal with actual known historical or present-day people, the message here, both moral and profound, seems as timely these days as when the movie was first released in the 80's.  That ""morality"" message posits that pursuit of profits and materialistic riches above any/most other considerations, especially above individual human integrity and decency, is an eventually losing proposition for any truly decent, thinking person, with true integrity.

Being a more ""conventional"" film, the ""morality message"" here may pass way over a lot of people's heads, especially those Oliver Stone haters who've never seen this and/or who are automatically turned off to any Oliver Stone effort, but the message remains Stone's most powerful, if obscure.  And this is a must see, and Stone's overall best movie.

Charlie Sheen, (and to a lesser extent, his real life father and cinematic icon Martin Sheen, who amazingly enough plays the main character's real life father), as well as an outstanding performance by oscar-winning Michael Douglas, and other acting gems, as well as a fast-pace, little filler, linear plot and execution, add up to something really special.

The junior Sheen plays an up and coming and hoping, Wall Street, poor, ""player"" wannabe, who works as a going nowhere fast financial investments seller within the legal stock market system, whose main goal is to get close to one of the real players in the American financial market.  After much effort, he finally and with dogged persistence, gets a short ""meeting"" with an all powerful, super-rich, almost legendary established player in the form of Michael Douglas.

Selling his soul early on, ""Bud"" (Charlie Sheen) soon begins to throw aside all of his roots and basic decent, moral upbringings, as well as the fate of his father and many decent working folks, in order to happily fall under the spell of his sociopathic leader/teacher (Gordon Gekko - Douglas), and enjoys enormous financial ""success"" within the philosophy of his indecent mentor.  For awhile, the almost religious mantra of Gekko's ""greed is good"" more than succeeds, but for a short time only.

Before long, Sheen finds himself in a swank upper-east side Manhattan apartment, with money and the company of a beautiful, intelligent, but shallow girl (the best that can be bought), and sees a promising future as a true Wall Street player and wealthy corporate parasite. Trouble is, he loses his soul and moral fiber somewhere along the way, and realizes that for all his material gains, he has hurt the real people closest to him, and has betrayed them and his own self as well.

While Oliver Stone could've resolved and ended the film in a way he might've these days (strangely and sadly and even more so the same as it ever was concerning rich versus poor, haves versus have-nots, etc.), when corporate interests and money hunger rules over substance, he gives us instead a character who finally and deeply realizes the evil he has helped create, and does something about it.

If only the true humanitarian message and morals of this film could be realized and understood by our present day corporations, CEO's, power brokers, and by our indecent PTB and politician/law-makers (and the superficial and sensationalist-driven mainstream media and Hollywood elite), this world would be, I believe, a lot better one in which to live.

This is a film as topical as anything since, unfortunately, but the lessons have yet to be learned, and if anything, the PTB (powers that be) have only since gained more and more, at the expense of others less fortunate.  For those viewing this as simply a pretty decent flick, without any heavy moral undertones, it is still Stone's most satisfying and easily understood filmic experience.  In addition however, for those who read between the lines, and truly get the under-the-surface morality message here, it simply but powerfully renders upon the viewer a deep questioning of what ""success"" really is, and at what acceptable cost.

""Wall Street"" was produced in the 80's, but its message and power, seem as true today as ever.  Unlike so many other murky or over the top Oliver Stone films though, it remains, and probably will for some time, the definitive cinematic morality play from one of America's greatest filmmakers.  Its message is clear, upon repeated viewings, and that is that reality is, we are all in this together, we sink and/or swim together, and harming others in the pursuit of selfish gain, is a moral philosophy doomed to spiritual and individual failure, in the end.  No matter how great the temporary materialistic gains.

If you only see one Oliver Stone film in your life, let it be his best, in my view, this one.  If its subtle but sublime morality message does not grab you at first, it probably will eventually, as you think about it more and more later on.",1172534400,,5765,4.924664602683179
1398183,4,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is the story of young, naive stockbroker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who is too impatient to go through the right channels to success and instead lets him impatience get him in trouble. Sick of cold calling, Bud Fox goes straight for the big fish... in this case, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) an entrepreuneur who is often written about in Fortune magazine, aka the Bible. When Bud gets involved with Gordon, before he knows it he's losing all his inhibitions, caring nothing about the consequences of his actions, and is involved in an insider trading scam that threatens to ruin his family.

Wall Street is arguably Oliver Stone's best film, and has the solid acting, stellar film quality, and impressive use of light and sound to earn itself the title. It's even more relevant in the insider trading obsessed climate of the early 21st century, and I think its tale of backstabbing and betrayal will--sadly--always have a place in modern society. Charlie Sheen shines as a naive, impatient young buck who refuses to take the necessary time to achieve success on his own and instead is willing to cut any corners on the path to fame and fortune. Michael Douglas plays the villain perfectly, without remorse and with no qualms about who gets crushed in the process.

1398186,4,B000056KQN,"It seems to me there's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive. In this light, ""Wall Street"" reminded me vividly of ""No Way Out"" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does.

Useless considerations apart, ""Wall Street"", directed by always controversial Oliver Stone, pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away. They always burn out, in a snap of fingers. And bigger they are, harder they fall, right?

The story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen, featuring a bright young ""sport"", Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life. He wants more, and hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful, vicious, influential and a sure winner. By sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence, Bud sneaks into Gekko's office and tries to prove his value to him. From here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young proteg who rises to the top at breakneck speed until, unexpectedly, something shatters his bond to the master. Something that hits home and makes Bud question his beliefs. What this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie, so I'll let that for you to find out if you didn't see it yet.

All the acting is quite superb, especially the relationship between Gekko and Fox. Martin Sheen - who is Charlie Sheen's father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work, not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down. He reminds me of Donald Sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone whenever he's on screen a couple of minutes at a time.

If you like high finance intrigue, big guys pulling the strings on each other, twists and turns, then ""Wall Street"" is probably essential. And it will probably give you an excuse to read Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"".",1143417600,,2305,4.533653846153846

1398191,5,B000056KQN,"The ambience of the Reagan-era stock boom is captured perfectly in this iconic film, starring Michael Douglas, Martin Sheen, and Charlie Sheen.

The younger Sheen plays Bud Fox, a young up-and-coming stockbroker who worms his way into the heart of darkness of Wall Street mogul Gordon Gekko (Douglas), who seduces the younger man into a lifestyle of stylish excess.

Martin Sheen plays Charlie's father, a role he reprised from real life. In WALL STREET the elder Sheen is an airline mechanic and union man to the cuffs of his coveralls who tries desperately to make his bedazzled son hold fast to bedrock blue-collar values.

Although the ethics lesson is heavy-handed and obvious, WALL STREET's closing moral is satisfyingly vague and open to interpretation, giving this film an unintended depth that still draws audiences two decades later.

Douglas's Gekko is the avaricious embodiment of the Gimme Decade, believing that, from start to finish as the great tagline to this movie says, ""Greed is good...Greed works."" Director Oliver Stone named Gekko after the infamous ""f.u. lizard"" of Vietnam, and it's an appropriate choice. Gekko, as the embodiment of a kind of ethical darkness, has much in common with APOCALYPSE...NOW's Colonel Kurtz (another Sheen vehicle). He is eminently piratical, dismembering companies, enemies and sexual conquests (Daryl Hannah plays the girl) gloatingly.

Smudging the seemingly simple lines drawn in the sand, Douglas's Oscar-winning portrayal is so overwhelmingly powerful that it effectively capsizes the movie and inverts the lesson in ethics. The mesmerizing, beautifully polished Gekko, reeking of amorality, becomes a study in the Will to Power.

Gekko, quite ironically, is The Man We All Want To Be. His strength however, comes less from within himself than from his ability to tap into the egocentric desires of others around him. Never promising anything, like a magician he demonstrates everything, exuding authority and certainty in that most uncertain and least authoritative of all universes, finance. Generations of MBAs, CFPs, and hungry young men of all stripes have seen WALL STREET as a McGuffey's Reader of sorts, providing a template for the look, tone, and attitude of success. Events have not proven them wrong.

Even as the sycophants around him disgustingly reduce everything to a crude dollars-and-cents cost-benefit analysis (take note of Daryl Hannah's reaction to Gekko's tacky modern art collection), Gekko seems to be above it all. True, he exhibits the predatory instincts of an alley cat throughout the picture, but he is also undeniably alluring.

Charlie Sheen does an excellent job as well playing the role of Bud Fox, a younger stock broker who finds himself drawn like a magnet to Gekko's world... ...at least for a while.  Bud Fox's dad Carl is played by Charlie's real-life dad Martin Sheen, and the conflict of interests that occur between Gekko, his British rival Sir Larry Wildman (played by Terence Stamp), and the two Foxs, provide the movie with a healthy amount of edge-of-your-seat drama.  Daryl Hannah's character is rather secondary, kind of like window dressing, but it works well in that respect and she does get the job done.

1398195,5,B000056KQN,"""Wall Street"" is iconic.

But let's step back a second: I'll beging with a little Wall Street habit called Full Disclosure: Oliver Stone's stunning, iconic ""Wall Street"" is an amazingly hard movie for me to review, in part because it was, for me, one of those rare watershed events that shaped my futue and changed---even charted---my career.

One of Oliver Stone's best movies, it was intended as a morality play in which Stone's mouthpiece, played by Martin Sheen as a stoic airline mechanic who has seen it all, condemned the helter-skelter rampant greed of the corporate raiders, Wall Street insider tycoons, and high-flying investment bankers of the 1980's, the much maligned ""Decade of Greed"".

But let's stop for moment, and consider: how many of you who've seen the film wanted to *be* Gordon Gecko, ""Wall Street""'s cigar chomping, greenmailing uber-dealmaker, who ratcheted up Ivan Boesky's ""Greed is OK"" into what became the motto of deal-makers the world over: ""Greed is Good. Greed Works.""

I sure did. Born during the hippy Summer of Love and a proverbial child of the eighties, I saw ""Wall Street"" and knew, immediately, what I wanted to become. I sliced off my mohawk, grew my hair, and slicked it back, and dedicated my life to mastering high finance and the art of the deal.

And I wasn't the only one, to judge by fellow MBA alums and investment banking colleagues; even a sequence in ""Boiler Room"" shows a new generation of deal-seeking young Turks watching ""Wall Street"" on a plasma TV, regaling each other with their word-perfect recitation of Gecko's lines.

""Wall Street"", then, should be served up piping hot to the innocent with a dollop of caution: as one reviewer noted, what Stone had intended as a bloody criticism of greed gone rampant quickly became a full-bodied recruiting video for the investment banking industry.

And what a recruiting video it is: Stone perfected his quick cuts and 'wall of information' with ""Wall Street"", proving his mastery of the new MTV-era of rich, lush, rapidly moving images and an editing style that wouldn't have been out of place in a music video.

Stone is like that. As a director, he has an uncanny ability to glamorize that which he most wants to criticize, just as he did with the alluringly violent Mickey and Mallory Knox in ""Natural Born Killers.""

And ""Wall Street"" is one of those rare reversals where life imitates art: throughout top-tier MBA programs and modern investment banks, the image of the stalking, cigar-smoking, summer-home in the Hamptons, limo-insulated, braces-sporting deal maker has become the ideal, sometimes getting the better of real Wall Street mavericks who let romance cloud their common sense and appeared on the covers of Fortune and Forbes---only to be shot down by their envious employers.

The plot is nothing new: a Horatio Alger story in which hungry young stockbroker (played perfectly by Charlie Sheen) Bud Fox tires of spending his days in a cheap Queens apartment chasing small retail investors, and sets his sights on the 'elephant': the maverick corporate raider Gordon Gecko (played by Michael Douglas in the role of his career).

Fox, for once, has an opening beyond Gecko's favorite box of cigars: he knows his father's airline, Blue Star, is worth more than the market thinks it is because of impending deregulation in the airlines; Gecko takes the bait, and brings Fox, quickly, into the high-octane world of deal-making and insider information---as Gecko's spy.

The acting is uniformly good: apart from Sheen and Douglas, you have the inimitable Sean Young as Gecko's social-climbing wife, Darryl Hannah puckish as fashion designer Darien, pre-""The Limey"" Terence Stamp hard as nails as a British corporate raider and Gecko's nemesis, and a troop of veteran character actors: Hal Holbrook as Fox's brokerage house mentor, James Spader as a naive M&A attorney, and the immortal James Karen as Fox's fickle boss.

From the opening riffs of Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"" to the closing image of a trading grid imposed over the lower Manhattan skyline, Stone's editing and direction is fast-paced, frenetic, and exotic: the viewer, like Fox, is pulled into the upper reaches of a world where anything is possible and money is the common denominator.

There are some subtle touches, like Gecko's beach house, festooned with atrocious artwork kept only as an investment---and as a barometer of the notoriously fickle and fast moving Market itself.

And for those ""Wall Street""-heads who have seen the movie a thousand times (I must be getting close), there are some sweet glitches the editors never caught: when Gecko makes his pitch for a 'friendly' takeover of Blue Star, watch his feet carefully.

Often imitated, never surpassed, ""Wall Street"" is a stylish, intoxicating, stunning embodiment of an era when anybody could carve his way to the very top of American society by ruthless ambition and sheer determination; it was true when it was made, and it is possibly even more true today.

So strap on your braces, slick back your hair, light up an Esplendido and fire up the DVD player---money never sleeps, pal.

1398200,4,B000056KQN,"Oliver Stone has made his second best movie after JFK, in my opinion with this powerful portrait of greeed and power in the middle of the financial capital of the world.
Gekko is typical character of those ages. It is not a bad guy, he just follows the rules, bets and wins, so what is the point with that?
The newcomer, Charlie Sheen is an idealist young man and his epci consists in twist the fate of this ambitious man who thinks he can move all the chess pieces without any risk.
There is just one complaint of my own. Stone seems just to wash the face to the system he attacks, and somehow this restrained gaze weakens the structure of the script. The good customes and the honesty finally win the game but how long can you smile with this bizarre triumph? and even worst are you sure you can talk about ethics in such atmosphere. Wall Street means risk and failure, competence and disloyalty, no rules just basic instinct if you want to survive.

1398201,4,B000056KQN,"Wall Street is so 1980s and that's not a bad thing!!

Michael Douglas IS Gordon Gecko in this film and that's probably why he walked off with the Oscar for Best Actor at the 1988 Academy Awards in this fascinating look at the high pressure world of the stock market.

While Charlie Sheen was the hot commodity at the time this film was made, his acting hasn't aged well and it's quite clear that a better choice could have been found for this movie, where the same thing can be said for Darryl Hannah who is only slightly better in her role as the high priced artist for sale to the highest bidder (richest boytoy she can find).

Oliver Stone's directing is very good but the backstory relating to BlueStar airlines could have been a little better but perhaps I just don't have very positive memories because of the trite acting by Charlie Sheen.

However, Michael Douglas alone is worth watching this film and its the performance of his career.

1398202,3,B000056KQN,"Not having a strong interest or knowledge in the world of stocks and bonds, WALL STREET failed to provide me with a satisfying cinematic experience.  Though I have been a fan of Michael Douglas for some time, it seems strange that he won an Oscar for a film in which he has little real screen time.  Most of the movie focuses on Charlie Sheen's character, and even though Douglas is perfect in the role of Gordon Gekko, I wasn't overwhelmed by his performance.  He won that year over William Hurt (Broadcast News); Marcello Mastroianni (Dark Eyes), Jack Nicholson (Ironweed) and Robin Williams (Good Morning Vietnam).  Assuredly, Douglas embodied the corporate greed of Gekko, but it is ultimately a one note performance, without any shadings of real personality.  Charlie, meanwhile, in one of his first major roles, is only about 50% effective, and his power comes in the scenes he shares with his father, Martin, who played his father in the film.  There are nice supporting turns from James Karen as the duplicitous sales manager; John C. McGinley as Charlie's sometime buddy broker; Terence Stamp as Gekko's British rival; James Spader as a yuppie lawyer; and of course Martin as Charlie's father whom he betrays.  Daryl Hannah is awful in a one-note role as Douglas' ex-mistress and Sheen's current honey.  Sixties ingenue Millie Perkins has an all too brief cameo as Charlie's mother in the final ten minutes of the movie.

Oliver Stone's movies have always been provocative and WALL STREET is no different.  But I have always found myself disturbed by his movies in that they are not the most ""entertaining"" of films; there's always a message, and this time, the one that ""greed is good"" just doesn't fill the bill for me.  Michael Douglas has given enough great performances that this Oscar to me rewards his body of work rather than this one role.",1113696000,,1857,4.863492063492063
1398203,5,B000056KQN,"Few movies capture the mind and heart as this movie. It is basically about Bud Fox, a sales manager in Wall Street. He deals mostly low-key shares and he is aiming for the big time. He seeks the opportunity to work with Gordon Gecko, a multi-billionaire investor who is smart as he is ruthless. Meanwhile, Bud Fox is also facing his father's criticism about what he does for a living...""Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of other people's money"", his father says. I admit, I am addicted to this movie. Every few months, I have to slot in the DVD and watch it. It is a delight to watch every single time. This movie deals with many important and all too real issues. Everybody wants to be rich, but how far would you go to achieve that goal? Is it worth betraying the people you love? Changing your morals and values in life? And when you do make it big, who can you trust? How sure are you? These are just some of the elements Oliver Stone delved into in this movie. Using Wall Street and the share market as his backdrop, he has created a masterpiece.

The first thing that immediately grabs you is the acting. Superb performances from some of the most talented but often misused actors in Hollywood. Michael Douglas has always been one of my favourite actors and in this movie, he IS Gordon Gecko. He is the epitome of corporate power. The way he speaks, and acts....classic stuff. One of my favourite scenes, is when he gives the speech during the shareholder meeting of Teldar Paper. Unbelievably good! He won a truly deserving Oscar for his portrayal of Gecko. Because of Douglas' fantastic acting, it tends to overshadow another actor who is as deserving of praise, Charlie Sheen. To be honest, I am not a fan of Charlie Sheen and found his acting mediocre in many movies, which was why I was pleasantly surprised with his acting here. He was really very good as Bud Fox, looking up to Gecko as his mentor, never overacting and having the coolness to pull off lines like ""You get out that door, I'm changing the locks"". He plays the part of a young man not knowing exactly what he wants in life once he achieved his idea of success perfectly. And the supporting cast, Martin Sheen (playing Bud Fox's dad with pure emotion, it seems like he's saying what he really means to his son) and Darryl Hannah (as Bud Fox's love interest) does not disappoint.

Kudos to Oliver Stone for writing such a powerful script. This is not the usual garbage Hollywood likes to dump us with...this is a brilliant screenplay with great dialogue. ""Greed will not only save Teldar Papers, but that other malfunctioning corporation known as the United States"", Gecko says. Heck, even at home, I felt like giving a standing ovation to that. And the camera angles were also something I found fascinating in this movie. For example, when we're first shown Gecko, we don't get to see him immediately. Oliver Stone teases us with a Fortune magazine cover, and then by a shot of his office, when someone enters his office, the door opens and closes just enough time so that we get a glimpse of Gecko and hear his voice but never really getting a good look of him, right until Bud Fox meets with him. And towards the end, when things go wrong, a dark shadow falls upon the office. Beautiful!

Honestly, everything about this movie seems to work perfectly, which is why the 5-star rating. This is one of my all-time favourites and I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you're involved in the share market or not, because the scope of this movie extends to so much more than that, that I'm sure different people would appreciate it on different levels.

It's an old-fashioned morality play, though, with Charlie trying to mend his ways. It's a hard-hitting, very well-acted drama - and effective because Stone incorporates all the old ideals of repentence and ""crime does not pay.""

1398205,5,B000056KQN,"To watch this movie in Moscow in 1988 as a student was a liberating and exhilarating experience. Here is the capitalism close-up, warts and all. And we loved it. In three more years the Soviet communism will be dismantled, free market hurriedly introduced, and some of my friends and fellow students will proceed to become very rich people themselves. I did not know then, that Gordon Gekko, a villain who incidentally was much admired by me, was a thinly veiled portrait of Ivan Boesky. Boesky, who incidentally was a son of Russian immigrants, became a center of the biggest insider trading scandal and government investigation in the 1980s, which let to the collapse of junk bond powerhouse firm Drexel Burnham. However, I knew that Gekko must be much more than a villain, otherwise how this ugly character could be so attractive? Of course, a huge part of it was a superb acting by Michael Douglas. But watching this film now, 17 years later, gave me an opportunity to ponder more on the subject from a different perspective. I think now that Gekko's character is archetypal and has the same qualities as Bulgakov's Woland from `Master and Margarita'. He is the Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand seducer, not just some greedy upstart and `faux bonhomme'. But one of the qualities of Lucifer is that he `brings out the light', he helps to illuminate things, partly because of his own darkness. Untimely, in the movie it was his turbulent encounter with Gekko, which helped Bud Fox to find his character and, in a way, redeem himself.

1398210,4,B000056KQN,"Real-life bigtime investment banker Jeff Beck not only advised Oliver Stone when he made 'Wallstreet' but also stars in this film for a few minutes playing himself at a climactic meeting of topdog-lawyers and bankers. He delivers one of the many exhilarating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocence lost. ""Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!"" He shouts at Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who plays a struggling young stockbroker who's desperately trying to get on the fast track to becoming a ""player"".

 Michael Douglas who plays 'Gordon Gekko' (not 'Gecko' as the Amazon review suggests, the name can be seen in the scene where Charlie Sheen turns on his computer in the morning and finds out it's ""Gekko's Birthday"") puts on such a mind-blowing performance he really can be dubbed 'Gekko the Great'. The character is right up there with Don Vito Corleone, Tony Montana, Begbie, Popeye Doyle and some other members of that elite group of high-octane male movie-characters that will long outlive the actors that created them.

 Gordon Gekko is a high profile corporate raider that was probably modelled after Ivan Boesky (the biggest corporate raider of the 80's who eventually went behind bars for insider-trading), Michael Milken (creator and unchallenged 80's king of the high yield or junk-bond) and John Guttfreund (CEO of Salomon Brothers in the 80's who's extravert and bizarre behaviour is documented in the classic books ""Liar's Poker"" (Michael Lewis) and ""Barbarians at the Gate"" (John Helyar).

 Michael Douglas seems to have been born to play this part and from the moment he is introduced (""Lunch? whaddaya kiddin' me, lunch is for wimps!"") to the moment we viewers have to part from his hypnotic character (""I gave you Darian, I gave you everything!"") he reduces any leaps of faith that his character may present us with to tiny hops due to his powerhouse presence. In fact, whenever I see Michael Douglas in another movie I have the strange feeling that Gordon Gekko is trapped inside and might burst out at any time to hose us down with sardonic one-liners. (""Love is just an old lie created to keep people from jumping out of windows."")

 Gekko is truly the mother of all high rollers, and his performance alone more than warrants the purchase of this film. Apart from that it looks great with crisp Miami Vice type of clean-cut shots and scenery. The whole set up is utterly believable. I work in Derivatives Sales in London and deal with brokers, traders and senior decision makers of the world's leading investment firms on a daily basis. Either they all modelled themselves after Gordon Gekko or for some reason Michael Douglas got it exactly right. Aggression, impatience with political correctness and urgency to get deals/trades done is what this movie and real Capital Markets are all about.

 Charles Sheen plays a believable 'Bud Fox' but one wonders what a late 80's Tom Cruise or Kiefer Sutherland might have done with the part. Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with. A baffling fact is that Stone admits on this DVD in an interview that Cruise called him to say he'd love to play the part but Stone ""had already promised it to Charlie"".

 I won't get into the details of the story here but will post some comments on the general themes in the movie.

 There's the theme that Stone had already explored in 'Platoon' of two fathers fighting for the soul of their son. In Platoon it was Tom Berenger and Willem Defoe battling for custody of Charlie Sheen's spirit. In Wallstreet it's Douglas and Martin Sheen representing the 'exciting but evil' and 'wholesome but tedious' ways to go for Charlie Sheen's character. This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.

 The other theme that Stone put into this narrative is the bleeding heart ""Capitalism is bad and unfair"" jingle. ""I don't produce anything...I own..."" Gekko confesses at one point. ""How many boats to water-ski behind do you need? When is it enough?!"" cries a shocked Bud Fox. The moral comments on successful capitalists come across somewhat naive and in my opinion don't really work. I won't go into the details but most people I've met who've seen the movie don't even remember what it was about Gordon Gekko that was so wrong. All they remember is the classic ""Greed is Good"" speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue. The fact that Oliver Stone lets Gekko initiate industrial espionage is the reason I gave the movie only four stars instead of five.

 I personally think this was a real blooper. A man in Gekko's position doesn't need the aggravation of blatantly breaking the law. There's a good plot line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has perfectly legal plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale. It seems as though Stone was so set on painting a negative picture of egotistical an a-moral Wall-Streeters that he went one bridge too far.

 Fact is that, if anything, this movie is like a recruiting video for Investment Banking. What ""Top Gun"" did for Naval Aviation ""Wall Street"" has done for Investment Banking. Big corporate banks have never had to complain about the amount of interested well-educated young hopefuls but nowadays there's probably not one person sitting in any dealing room anywhere in the world who has not seen Wall Street. For one I am convinced that if it wasn't for the scenes that have the camera following runners and stressed out yuppies yelling ""How about those September fifties!"" I wouldn't have been in this racket.

 The dealing room-scenes are some of the most exhilarating scenes in the history of cinematography. Spielberg immersed audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44. Stone creates the same spellbinding grip on the audience without getting anybody shot or brutally maimed. That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood. More so for the man who made a career in gory cinematic violence with the screenplay for 'Scarface' and directing 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers'.

 All Hail Gekko the Great! See this movie again and again. It's full of catchy one-liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will. ""Life all comes down to a few moments, this is one of them...""",1090540800,,6462,4.880365296803653
1398211,4,B000056KQN,"Oliver Stone will never be known for subtlety.  ""Wall Street"" bashes you over the head with its message- getting to the top in society requires duplicity, dishonesty, and the willingness to destroy any obstacle.  However, unlike Ayn Rand, Stone vilifies rather than lauds this dubious morality.  Bud Fox is a fresh faced, innocent stock broker trying to get ahead through hard work and elbow grease, as he was taught by his father.  Bud soon meets powerful, charismatic corporate raider Gordon Gekko, incapable of love, remorse, or empathy.  Gekko, we are told, sold NASA short 15 minutes after the Challenger exploded (impossible since the shuttle was destroyed in 1986 and the film is set in 1985!).  Gekko predictably seduces Bud with his world of ""perks"", and Bud's star rises dramatically the farther he falls into corruption.
Throughout the film, Bud serves as a sounding board for the rival values of Gekko and his father.  The speech most cited by critics and fans is the immortal ""Greed is Good"" monologue.  While this speech, standing alone, is a vigorous defense of capitalism and selfishness, it is important to note that Gekko is using it at a shareholders' meeting against a lousy, entrenched, and greedy management!
Inevitably, Bud is forced to decide whether to follow his father's philosophy or Gekko's, and to pay the price for his misdeeds.  A slight complaint with the ending- the fate of Gekko is hinted at rather than displayed.  Gordon Gekko has become something of a hero for young, wanna-be big shots, who are attracted to the glamour of his lifestyle and his ""up your's, I got mine!"" attitude much as Bud was.  Perhaps seeing Gekko get his comeuppance could have made an impression.
Overall, Wall Street is a tight, well done character drama populated with iconic characters delivering iconic dialogue that acts as an indictment of a decade.  The movie and its message will stay with you long after viewing it.
As for the DVD, the sound, although in 5.1, is relegated almost exclusively to the center channel.  One does not hear the sounds of Manhattan from all directions as Bud navigates the concrete jungle.  The video quality appears grainy in some areas.  This is a great movie worthy of better treatment on DVD.",1089849600,,2243,4.928191489361702
1398212,5,B000056KQN,"In 1987 OLIVER STONE again starred Charlie Sheen, this time as Bud Fox, along with Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas, in ""Wall Street"". Stone, like Coppola's ""Patton"", tapped into a part of America he really wanted to discredit, but instead glorified. Based on the go-go stock markets of the Reagan '80s, it is loosely based on inside arbitrageurs and junk bond kings like Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. Fox/Sheen is an idealistic, ambitious young stockbroker, his father is his conscience, and Douglas as Gordon Gekko is pure tantalizing temptation. Fox must violate SEC laws and get inside information in order to do business with the ""big elephant"" Gekko. Gekko's star fades when a big deal-gone-bad has personal ramifications, and Fox turns a dime on him. The film is supposed to show that America is a greedy place that ""produces nothing"" in a ""zero sum game"" in which the rich only make money on the backs of the poor. Gekko's (Stone's) statements about economics are pure, unadulterated economic lies shown to be lies simply by...observing factual things. Where Stone may have had second thoughts was the reaction the film got. As the years went by, he and others were approached countless times by Young Republicans and Wall Street execs who told him the depiction of the exciting world of finance led them into that very career, which they thanked him for! Stone had hoped to create an egalitarian class. Instead, he created a decade full of Gordon Gekkos. They in turn fueled the dot-com boom. It was not unlike the Democrats who hoped to expose Oliver North and the Republicans in the Iran-Contra ""scandal,"" only to discover that millions thought Ollie and his White House pals were doing God's work in fighting Communism.

WALL STREET is more than just an indictment of the 80's.  It's a treatise on wealth and how quickly it makes you rationalize behavior you didn't think you were capable of.  Obviously, this is a relevant lesson in any era.
Plenty of other film have attempted to preach this same message.  Most of them have failed.  And even the good ones don't contain anything that can compare to the scene where Sheen gets busted.  Or Gordon's famous ""Greed is good"" speech (sounds a lot like what we're hearing about globalization, doesn't it?).

I'm here to tell you that it wasn't.  Instead of making am movie about the exciting and dramatic Wall Street world in the 80's, Oliver Stone shamelessly makes a flat movie about a criminal.
The only reason why I give this movie two stars it contains some of the great ""all time"" movie lines including:
""Money's only something you need in case you don't die tomorrow.""
""You're walking around blind without a cane, pal. A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place.""
But as a whole, I find the movie to be a cheap attack on capitalism. The truth of the matter is that the real life stories of M&A and corporate takeovers were exciting enough. Stone had no reason to louse up a good concept with a convoluted plot about that includes every financial headline of the 1980's (insider trading, offshore banking, junk bonds, and corporate takeovers).

""Wall Street"" is a very good movie thanks to the script, the direction, the dialogues, and above all the performances of the lead actors Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen, all of them gave an outstanding performance, specially Michael Douglas in the role that got him an Academy Award.
As usual, Oliver Stone created a very personal movie, he co-wrote the screenplay and dedicated the story to his father, a former stockholder.

Bud starts to make more money than he ever dreamed was possible. But he soon learns that the pursuit of overnight riches comes at a price that is too high to pay.
Wall Street takes us into the world of the stock market and insider trading. It is definately Oliver Stone's best film, and one of the best that I have ever seen overall. No matter how many times you see this movie, it never gets boring, or seems any less amazing. Michael Douglas offers one of the most memorable lines of all time with ""Greed is good"". This is the driving force for the film. This perhaps, is the film's best feature because the story is so authentic. Stone manages to fully capture all of the glory that Wall Street can bring, and the misery that it can cause.
Of course, you need talented actors to make it convincing. Michael Douglas gives the best role of his career as Gordon Gecko. In fact, he won an Academy Award for Best Actor for the role. It is that good. Gordon is a man that is ruled by greed, and is completely ruthless. That is why Charlie Sheen's portrayal of Bud Fox plays so well off of Douglas. Sheen is young, ambitious, and also extremely naive. He is the puppet, and Gecko is the puppeteer. Martin Sheen delivers an extremely solid role as Bud's father Carl. I loved the fact that Martin Sheen got the role, because only a real father could bring such a realistic portrayal of love. There are other great actors as well in this film, and they include Hal Halbrook, John C McGinley, Daryl Hannah, and Terrance Stamp.

1398220,5,B000056KQN,"While the subject of the stock market and trading on Wall Street doesn't interest me in the least, I loved how Oliver Stone made it interesting is ""Wall Street"". It stands as one of his most intellegent and accomplished films, with a smart (if overly-technical) script and superb acting.
Charlie Sheen, the quintessential 80's heartthrob, takes on a new role as Bud Fox, an ambitious young stock trader. He works his days selling stocks, all the while hoping to be a player in the same league as the big guys. One such big guy is Gordon Gekko (Michaek Douglas, in a standout performance), a millionaire tycoon who makes his living buying out companies and liquidating them for profit. He takes Fox under his wing, gives him a taste of the wealth and power, and Fox becomes insatiable. So much that he makes some wrong decisions, not realizing that this new power and wealth comes at a higher cost, one that he cannot afford.
The 80's was characterized by hotshot young executives looking for the quick and easy buck, and Oliver Stones portrayed that very well here. Gordon Gekko is the benchmark corporate villian, someone who one see's the world only in shades of green. The acting in this movie is first rate, especially from Michael Douglas. The long lines of dialogue, the speeches, and the emotional undertones are a challenge for any actor, and all involved here did an excellent job. I often watch ""Wall Street"" just for the acting.
The DVD is not a full-blown Special Edition, but it's a quality release nonetheless. Oliver Stone's commentary is insightful and articulate, even though he rambles and speaks in an annoying deep voice. The ""Making Of"" documentary is a real treat.

Michael Douglas, in a career-defining roles nails Stone's excellent dialogue and delivers some of the best monologues ever put on film. He deserved the Best Actor Academy Award he won that year. His ""greed is good"" speech still gives me goosebumps.
After years of watching Wall Street on a faded, beat-up pan and scam VHS tape or on TV, it is so sweet to finally see it on DVD in it's proper aspect ratio. The transfer is top notch -- the film doesn't look a day old. However, the two highlights of this DVD are the fascinating documentary -- which features Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Martin Sheen talking about their experiences working on Wall Street and how they feel about it today. Accompanying this documentary is an excellent audio commentary by Stone. As always, his comments are informative and candid -- he expresses regret that he cast Daryl Hannah in the role of Charlie Sheen's materialistic girlfriend and mentions that he should have swapped her role with Sean Young's.
It's scary how Stone's film mirrored corporate society back then (and they way it is now) and how it anticipates contemporary scandals like Enron. Great stuff!",1049328000,,1421,4.827868852459017

Charlie Sheen portrays a character that many of us can identify with, someone just out of school in their first job and trying to make an impression on the world.  I think we've all been through that.  In Gordon Sheen sees the epitome of success and only when he is allowed to get close does he see that the grass is not always greener on the other side, there are definitely patches of brown as well, but spray painted to look green.
Sheen's performance is good, but I don't think great.  He appears a little too meek at times and yet also assertive in trying to get what he wants, such as sending Gordon a b-day card each year and convincing his friend to get him inside information.  It's a bit contradictory, but I guess we're all like that sometimes.
Hannah's performance was just OK.  Overall, the story is great and I would recommend it to anyone who's interested in business, investing, stocks, business politics, etc.",1048118400,,1155,4.4714285714285715

1398228,5,B000056KQN,"I really liked this 1980s classic.  It very accurately portrays the wild, amoral, hedonistic capitalism of the day, which is anything but religious or prudish.  I wonder how it came to be that stockbrokers ended up in the same political bandwagon as the Bible Belters.  The movie portrays capitalism's weak spots only too realistically, the unfortunate thorn to a system which, if managed properly like it is in modern Europe, can work well to deliver widespread prosperity and social justice.  But American politicians haven't gotten the right formula yet thanks to the guys you see in this film.
Michael Douglas's voice and demeanor work wonders to create the classic greed-addicted corporate raider who wreaks havoc with the markets and in the process gains control over the future of thousands of workers.  You won't find many references to Nike, Microsoft, or Starbucks here due to the time lapse since.  But many older investors will remember all the businesses named in this movie.  [name here] plays an intelligent newbie who has all the savvy moves down in no time, but maintains some sense of social justice and democratic values to the end, which are a driving force for one of his ""revenge"" moves that you'll see if you watch it.
Douglas's speech in the shareholder meeting is excellent but misnamed:  it should be Ambition is Good since excessive Greed leads to a deterioration of workers' living standards and an eventual collapse of the economy, like what happened in the 1920s and what is happening today on a smaller scale.  But he points out very directly that the desire to achieve and receive a ""badge of honor"" is the driving force behind human creativity.  Even so, as this movie points out, injustice is deeply entrenched in the system and the method of corporate governance over workers is completely undemocratic.",1037923200,,1838,4.977124183006536

Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, the aspiring young trader who wants to be The Big Man, to a T.  This movie does everything a movie should.  It entertains and makes you think without ever becoming preachy.  It never drops down to the left or right wings of economic thought.  On the one hand, Gorden Gecko is the epitome of everything wrong about capitalism, but on the other, he's everything that's right.  He's a greedy SOB, but he works like a demon and built himself up from nothing.  His worldview was perfectly encapsulated in his shareholders speech in which he gave out the famous line ""Greed is good,"" and then explained why.

You'd think the movie would be a bit dated by the technology and market environment displayed in this movie, but actually the change in times is interesting to observe, and the movie never grows dated because the story is relevant for all times.

Another small detail that I couldn't help but love was the gigantic ""THE END"" words displayed before the end credits.  This was the style used in the 30s through early 60s movies, especially at the end of tragic tales used to deliver a moral message, and it was a great subtle touch detectable only by movie afficianados.

The acting, directing, storyline, camera-work, is all superb. The film shows the attitudes concerning money and how important money was and is. More important than friends, more important than people, more important than life itself. One thing that suprised me was one reviewer's comment that they know many people that don't think Gekko,the greedy villian in the film, did anything wrong. That guy who wrote that really needs to get out of the Pat Buchanan Dinner Parties and start waking up to the real world!

Another comment I had issue with was that you had to be a ""bleeding heart"" to believe that capitalism is unfair and promotes greed.

1398241,3,B000056KQN,"Bud Fox (Martin Sheen) is a young, naive, wall street trader who will do anything to get to the big leagues.  This means showing up every day to Gordon Gekko's (Wall Street mogul played by Michael Douglas) office to beg Gekko's personal secretary to let him inside.  Finally, she takes pity on him and lets him in to see Gekko.  Amazingly Bud has little to offer but the same spiel he uses for his cold calls.  Then he remembers - a piece of inside information about his father's airline.  Gordon finds Bud a bit green but takes a liking to a reminder of his younger self.  After the first deal Gekko trains Bud to be the ruthless expert inside trader. ""Information"" is what Gordon has a monopoly on.  And novice traders, company employees and their management are ""victims"" of Gordon's insider game.  Of course here is where Oliver Stone shows his own naivete.  Is this the only way to make money on Wall Street?
One would think that like Bud Fox we would have to secretly shadow a billionaire investor to the ends of the earth and engage in industrial espionage to get in on his next deal before it went public.  Well would it not be easier to have walked around a few cities in the western US and witnessed people lining up for Starbucks coffee.  Had you acted on this observation six years ago and purchased the stock you would be quite wealthy today.  Perhaps a little honest effort and common sense might be a more effective strategy.
Really though the movie is a feel good film for Stones liberal audience - which is apparent in many of the reviews.  It is certainly nice to believe that the only way to make money in this world is to assume a ruthless posture and evil plan for taking from others (unless of course you're from Hollywood and your money is the sweetest smelling on the planet).  That way Stone's liberal audience can feel good about themselves.  Imagine having to think that many wealthy people exhibit strong personal disciplines like hard work, courage, and initiative and that these people have created wealth for themselves and others through legitimate means.  Of course then you have little excuse for your own pathetic life.  You might have to get up off your lazy rear end and actually do something for yourself.
I certainly don't apply these comments to Stone.  Stone is simply a hypocrite.  He works hard and makes money capitalist style by selling a movie that attacks capitalism.  In any case the movie was entertaining.  So three stars to Stone who talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk (to his credit).

This DVD features a documentary - quite good and fully justifying the purchase of DVD even if you already have a video, if only to learn Oliver Stone's socialist views told in his own words. The man actually believes that people who don't work in companies should not be allowed to own them - and he actually says that! You don't often hear such a naive socialist rhetoric these days.
And then Douglas tells us how disappointed he is every time someone approaches him and confesses that the film was an inspiration for them to get into finance, stock market and fast-track lifestyle. Oh no. Another contender for hypocrisy prize.
For anyone who remembers the depiction of Blue Star airline and its oh-so-heroic, oh-so-honest trade union people as primitive, shallow and one-dimensional, it will be very interesting to see that Stone and Sheen actually put a lot of their thought and effort into it. Who knew. If they had not been trying, could this depiction have been any more lame?
I am pleased, in a kind of wicked way, that an attempt to attack capitalism turned out to be a collection of the most powerful quotes (""money never sleeps"", ""lunch is for wimps"" and the ultimate ""greed is good"") and ideological Bible of the people whom Oliver Stone despises most. Similarly, all the self-righteous trade-union ""honest men"" got a nightmare of a treatment - from someone who was just trying to glorify them.

1398243,4,B000056KQN,"Real-life bigtime investment banker Jeff Beck not only advised Oliver Stone when he made 'Wallstreet' but also stars in this film for a few minutes playing himself at a climactic meeting of topdog-lawyers and bankers. He delivers one of the many exhilirating monologues in this Epic tale of greed, pride and innocense lost. ""Now your boss will really start thinking he's Gekko the Great!"" He shouts at Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) who plays a struggling young stockbroker who's desperately trying to get on the fast-track to becoming a ""player"".
Michael Douglas who plays 'Gordon Gekko' (not 'Gecko' as the Amazon review suggests, the name can be seen in the scene where Charlie Sheen turns on his computer in the morning and finds out it's ""Gekko's Birthday"") puts on such a mindblowing performance he really can be dubbed 'Gekko the Great'. The character is right up there with Don Vito Corleone, Tony Montana, Popeye Doyle and some other members of that elite group of high-octane male movie-characters that will long outlive the actors that created them.
Gordon Gekko is a high profile corporate raider that was probably modeled after Ivan Boesky (the biggest corporate raider of the 80's who eventually went behind bars for insider-trading), Michael Milken (creator and unchallenged 80's king of the high yield or junk-bond) and John Guttfreund (CEO of Salomon Brothers in the 80's who'se extravert and bizarre behaviour is documented in the classic books ""Liar's Poker"" (Michael Lewis) and ""Barbarians at the Gate"" (John Helyar).
Michael Douglas seems to have been born to play this part and from the moment he is introduced (""Lunch? whaddaya kiddin' me, lunch is for wimps!"") to the moment we viewers have to part from his hypnotic character (""I gave you Darian, I gave you everything!"") he reduces any leaps of faith that his character may present us with to tiny hops due to his powerhouse presence. In fact, whenever I see Michael Douglas in another movie I have the strange feeling that Gordon Gekko is trapped inside and might burst out at any time to hose us down with sardonic one-liners. (""Love is just an old lie created to keep people from jumping out of windows."")
Gekko is truly the ""mother of all high-rollers"", and his performance alone more than warrants the purchase of this film.
Charles Sheen plays a believable 'Bud Fox' but one wonders what a late 80's Tom Cruise or Kiefer Sutherland might have done with the part. Charlie never really creates the electricity that Douglas shocks the audience with.
I won't get into the details of the story here but will post some comments on the general themes in the movie.
There's the theme that Stone had already explored in 'Platoon' of two fathers fighting for the soul of their son. In Platoon it was Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe battling for custody of Charlie Sheen's spirit. In Wallstreet it's Douglas and Martin Sheen representing the 'exciting but evil' and 'wholesome but tedious' ways to go for Charlie Sheen's character. This theme introduces some good tension in the storytelling.
The other theme that Stone put into this narrative is the bleeding heart ""Capitalism is bad and unfair"" jingle. ""I don't produce anything...I own..."" Gekko confesses at one point. ""How many boats to waterski behind do you need? When is it enough?!"" cries a shocked Bud Fox. The moral comments on succesful capitalists come accros somewhat naive and in my opinion don't really work. I won't go into the details but most people I've met who've seen the movie don't even remember what it was about Gordon Gekko that was so wrong. All they remember is the classic ""Greed is Good"" speech and ironically most of them agree with Gekko on the issue. The fact that Oliver Stone lets Gekko initiate industrial espionage is the reason I gave the movie only four stars instead of five.
I personnaly think this was a real blooper. A man in Gekko's position doesn't need the aggravation of blatantly breakin the law. There's a good plot-line concerning a fictive company 'Bluestar Airlines' that Gekko has his own plans with to make himself rich and get scores of hard working people fired that adds enough suspense to the tale.  It seems as though Stone was so set on painting a negative picture of egoistical an a-moral Wallstreeters that he went one bridge too far.
Fact is that, if anything, this movie is like a recruiting video for Investment Banking. What ""Top Gun"" did for Naval Aviation ""Wall Street"" has done for Investment Banking. Big corporate banks have never had to complain about the amount of interested well educated young hopefulls but nowadays there's probably not one person sitting in any dealing room anywhere in the world who has not seen Wall Street. I am currently a trader in Amsterdam and I am convinced that if it wasn't for the scenes that have the camera following runners and stressed out yuppies yelling ""How about those september 40's!"" I wouldn't have been in this racket.
The dealing room-scenes are some of the most exhilirating scenes in the history of cinematography. Spielberg sucked in audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44. Stone creates the same spellbinding grip on the audience without getting anybody shot or brutally maimed. That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood. More so for the man who made a career in gory cinematic violence with 'Scarface', 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers'.
Al Hail Gekko the Great! See this movie again and again. It's full of catchy one-liners that will make you not only the toast of any party but might provide you with more of an energy boost than any Tony Robbins video ever will.

""  Greed Is Good ""
And in a sense that is what this movie is all about, to some degree.  The opening titles to such a fantastic city as New York is matched in size and demeanor with Frank Sinatra along side singing.
Stone's masterpiece follows really the rise, and very big fall, of Bud Fox ( Played by Charlie Sheen ).  Sheen is a coldcalling, struggling broker at a securities firm in NY with the aspirations of being "" The Elephant...The Player "" on the other end of the phone with the money and the power to call all the shots.  To get there however is a totally different affair all together...  In short, not to give too much away from this fabulous movie, Fox chases the golden ticket by persistently calling the self made Wall St. legend Gordon Gekko ( played fabulously by Michael Douglas, the thought of Richard Gere in this role is ridiculous now! ).
Fox's persistence finally pays off with Gekko taking him in and teaching him the in's and out's of the insidering trading game, ""  The most valuable commoditity I know of is information "" quotes Gekko and it is exceptionally true in society at any time perioid.
This masterpiece of a film really pays homage well to the yuppie, bull market era of the 80's.  I remember the 1st time I ever saw it and the fast paced desire it gave me to want to be a trader in New York, buy buy!! Sell sell!  A lovely fact of this movie is that fact that is hasn't really dated that much, the clothes, cars, computers and haircuts are about all that really date it.
On the technical aspect of it, the picture is wonderfully clean and crisp in almost every scene.  The sound, the Dolby Dig 5.1, feels abit synthetic...but after all this is a movie that was made in '87 years before 5.1 was ever a thought to movie makers.  However, it's not a action movie so the sound should not matter as long as you can hear the dialogue.  The documentary about Wall St., and the commentary by Oliver Stone, are wonderfully inciteful and worth viewing at least once if not more.
On the whole the disc is a MUST own.  The story and the characters are what drive and enthrall you in this movie.  Douglas's performance alone as Gordon Gekko is worth the price of the disc to see again and again....",989452800,,2264,4.3619047619047615
1398245,5,B000056KQN,"First off I definitely don't view Gordon Gecko (GG) as either a sinner or a saint.  In my mind there is considerable merit in much of the wisdom that GG espouses.  One of my favorite lines from the film has to be when Buddy (Charlie Sheen) asks GG 'What about hard work?'  Gecko's response is right on the money and histerical at the same time.  Gecko's ethics may be lacking but his sense of what is truly reality in our society is absolutely correct and should be pondered and learned from.
And then you have the contrast of Martin Sheen's character who is just your average typical hard working blue collar guy (commendable).  But he like so many others like him is at the mercy of the true powers that be.  THERE IS A HAPPY MEDIUM BETWEEN THE TWO. Each has its own merits. That is what I personally strive for.
Charlie Sheen is fabulous.  He displays so much honesty in every scene whether it's snorting coke with a hooker, schmoozing secretaries to gain entrance, or utter deflation as he is being arrested.  Michael Douglas gives one of my favorite performances ever.
It's a real thrill to see the hope and naive exuberance of youth be contrasted with stark reality of truth.
One of my top 10 favorite films of all time.",988070400,,1226,4.490990990990991
1398246,5,B000056KQN,This is one of the few films that truly captures the spirit of greed that was rampant on wall street in the 1980's an absolute must see.  Michel Douglas finest performance in my opinion.  It shows how difficult it was to avoid the tempations of insider trading during Wall Streets most scandolous decade.,982627200,,304,4.716981132075472
1398247,4,B000056KQN,"WALL STREET has always been one of my favourite Oliver Stone films. it crackles with the same intense, acerbic dialogue as SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS. from his ""Greed is good"" speech to the way he handles day to day deals with ruthless efficiency, you can see how Michael Douglas nailed this role of the ultimate amoral insider and deservedly won the Oscar that year for Best Actor.
after watching this film on a crappy pan and scam VHS tape, it is so gratifying to finally see this film given a proper DVD treatment. the transfer is crisp and clear with good sound but the real selling points are the fascinating documentary -- which features Douglas and Charlie Sheen and their views and thoughts of the film after all this time -- and Stone's informative and candid audio commentary. for someone like myself who has seen this film a zillion times, listening to Stone's observations on his movie was a real treat. great stuff. along with GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS, this is one of THE best films about money, greed and the people who ruthlessly pursue it.",980121600,,1046,4.65945945945946
1398248,4,B000056KQN,"When I saw this film first ten years ago I understood that the idea of the film was to show that business is very rough and there is no place to emotions and friendship. Now, as I know a lot more about stock market, I looked at this movie again and found a lot of very interesting details what became new to me, and this was only because of a better knowlidge about stock market. Therefore, for a person who is not good in finaces and stocks, may be this film a little bit difficult. Although, as I wrote before, the basic idea is very understandable. The two main characters in this movie are Michael Douglas who plays an investment banker and does not choose between methods to earn money and Charlie Sheen who is just a usual stock broker at the age of twenties. The film is about the business they do together while in the beginning they seem to be friends and in the end strong enemies. Douglas, of coure,is in his best again. Half of the prettiness of the movie comes from Douglas's dialogues. You just listen to them and pick up the ideas and ""proverbs"" what are the basis for the success in this field. Sheen is, I think in this movie, playing a little bit simple minded brocker and sometimes it seems even that the character of Sheen is the type of ""I sell you the best"" or ""I am the winner"". The film is I think made for those, who try to understand the basic ideas of stock market and I am pretty sure that the scenario is taken from real life. So I advise everybody to watch this Wall street classic movie.",979516800,,1518,4.256055363321799

Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is a ruthless multi-millionaire financial tycoon who calls on a young aspiring stock broker, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), to help him obtain illegal inside corporate information.  Fox gets caught up in all the hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing in his direction and he loses sight of the more important things in life.  Only when Gekko tries to ruin Fox's father's (Martin Sheen) employer, a commercial airline, does he see the error in his ways.
Daryl Hannah plays Darien Taylor, a neo interior decorator with a nose for the big bucks.  She falls for Fox as the money rolls in.

1398253,5,B000056KQN,"If you're trying to decide whether to buy it or not, trust me run, don't walk to your nearest video store and buy it now. This film is outstanding. Brilliant performances by Michael Douglas, Martin Sheen, Terrance Stamp, Darryl Hannah and by far Charlie Sheen's crowl jewel to date. Sorry, I don't count Hot Shots or Hot Shots Part Deux...please. Michael Douglas's character, Gordon Geckko, is a composite of the inside trader scoundrels that plagued Wall Street in the late eighties. Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, an aspiring young  stock trader on Wall Street trying to hit the big leagues during the yuppie craze of the eighties. Charlie's real-life father, Martin Sheen plays his dad in the film, and it adds an important sense of realism to the film. Terrance Stamp, a British actor, whose best known for being General Zod in Superman 2 with Christopher Reeve, sad since he's such a brilliant actor. In this film, he plays a rival British trader, who has an extreme dislike for Gordon. Darryl Hannah gives her best performance other than Splash, as Charlie's interior decorator girlfriend, whose lust for fame and money rivals his own. A great supporting cast surround the strongest of lead character's, though, Michael Douglas, who won an academy award for his portrayal, and rightfully so. Of all his film's,  this one truly exemplifies his brilliance as an actor. I leave you with a classic line to one of his many brilliant speeches in the film, ""Greed is Good, Greed works...""",973728000,,1485,4.888888888888889
1398254,4,B000056KQN,"WALL STREET
Oliver Stone, after conquering the panic and fear of vietnam in PLATOON, followed up with a gung assault on Reagan era greed and gluttony and insider trading. WALL STREET is that film's title, and a young, wide-eyed Charlie Sheen plays the blue collar boy that grows up to be a white collar success on as a broker, all the while breaking his dad's heart. A surrogate father of sorts comes Sheen's way in the devilish shape of Michael Dougas as a huge power player that mutters the immortal tagline: ""Greed is good."" Sheen is lead down the wrong path and ultimately has to decide between his stacks of cash or his own integrity.
This great film is quite a morality play and is just one of the shiny gems adorning Stone's filmography. It is a film that has no clear cut protagonist, just a man who wants to be honest and get rich quick, but finds that one can rarely be both. This film is quickly shaping up to be one of the keenest insights into that decadent decade... a film that will more than likely stand the test of time.
It is truly a contemporary classic.
Another note:  The movie would be great on a double bill with the recently released BOILER ROOM. One key scene in that film has the leads gathered together at home viewing WALL STREET. These shady young brokers know each and every line by heart, showing viewers exactly what these men are and what they want to be. BOILER ROOM is not as exceptional as WALL STREET, but a good flick nonetheless.",973468800,,1469,4.440740740740741
1398255,5,B000056KQN,"This movie captures Americas' obsession with all things material in mid to late eighties. Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen give performances of their careers. Perhaps Oliver Stone's best movie as well. Dialog is clever. Screenplay is fast moving and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. The movie is entertaining, honest and yet lets you draw your own conclusions. The Wall Street types will probably idolize Gordon Gekko (""Greed is good!""). In fact, a clip from Wall Street was prominently featured in a recent movie called Boiler Room. The blue-collar worker types will perhaps admire the father (an airline machinist) of Charlie Sheen's character. While the rest sympathize with Charlie Sheen (ambitious stockbroker) who is presented with ethical choices and opportunities that any mortal will have a hard time reconciling. He makes some good decisions and some not so wise choices. This movie is a must see!",973209600,,922,5.194630872483222
1398256,5,B000056KQN,"Oliver Stone researched this movie pretty good to portray Wall Street behind the scenes as authentic as possible. And while the financial dimensions from when this movie was made have significantly increased to at least ten times higher amounts today, the basic principles still apply. That's why the movie comes across fresh. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance and Charlie Sheen is doing good too. Douglas plays the wealthy financier Gordon Gekko as he takes on one deal after the other with information being the most important commodity . . . insider information that is. The movie isn't made on a small budget either like some of the recent copycats, but instead the beach house, the offices, the plane, the cars (except for Charlie Sheen's car), the wardrobe, all have style. While Gekko is supposed to be the bad guy, he comes across as very likeable and he shows us capitalism at its finest . . . it's a game as money is never lost but only transferred and whoever has the most in the end, wins. The question in the movie of how much is enough is answered there with it's not a matter of enough, and it certainly inspired the bull market of the 90s with its crystal clear reality of no limits and it's never going to be enough. Greed is good as Gekko proclaims in this motion picture.",972432000,,1303,4.620689655172414

But, maybe he should realize that he is grossly rich. Why is that ok? And not making a career out of being a Wall Street entrepreneur? I enjoyed the movie for what I thought of it, not for what Stone was trying to say. Yes, there are those of us out here who enjoy getting rich investing other people's money!

1398260,5,B000056KQN,"A great look at the world of stock trading, Oliver Stone's Wall Street is  very realistic.  It tells the story of young Bud Fox, an eager stock broker  working for a semi-successful firm in New York City.  He one day gives  Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas, in an Oscar winning role, a call  on his birthday.  Gordon is one of the richest men in the industry, in a  donald Trump like role.  He gives him the tip on Bluestar Airlines, with  which Bud's father works, and gave him the tip on the stock. Gekko takes  the deal, and makes a killing.  He then takes young Bud under his wing and  shows him the ropes.  He gives him many rewards, women, money, cars, but  the insider information Bud gave him is illegal.  But, if Bud doesn't tell  anyone, then Gordon won't.  If.  The writing is excellent, as is with an  Oliver Stone movie.  This movie came along before Stone began to use the  fast and shaky camerea techniques he has used in Nixon, Natural Born  Killers, and Any Given Sunday, so it's easier to follow.  Douglas  definitely deserves his Oscar, but Stone should have also won for  direction.  This is a must see.",968025600,,1130,4.438423645320197

However, as much as I'd recommend this film for it's  entertainment value, as a professional trader who has been making his  living from trading stocks and commodities for his own personal account for  the past twelve years, I have to say that this film does more to perpetuate  every myth and psychological bias that causes the majority of people to  LOSE money in the markets than just about any other film I can think of.  Chief among them in this film is that inside information is required or  even desirable in many cases in order to make money. This may just be a  reflection of the biases of it's director, but IMO, a bit more in depth  research and the inclusion of another character, for contrast's sake, of a  successful, honest trader and his or her methods would not have gone amiss.  I kept hoping this would develop in the character of Lou Manheim, but it  never did. Bottom line: Very entertaining story, but it ain't no success  manual.
