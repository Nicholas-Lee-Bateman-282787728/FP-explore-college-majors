7933741,5,B000059HWA,"FOR THE FANS is a great Backstreet Boys video. At first I thought the video would be really short, stupid, and cheesy since it was exclusivily from Burger King and the price was very low (even though I still wanted it anyway). But not so! In fact, this is a very detailed video which takes you on a closer look at their 'Into The Millennium' tour from last year. The live performance footage was taken from their concert in Indianapolis (wish I had been there!). They do live performances of ""Larger Than Life"", ""Don't Want You Back"", ""Back To Your Heart"" (where Kevin plays the piano and Nick plays the drums!:), ""All I Have To Give"", and ""I Want It That Way"". And they show the whole songs - not just little snipets. They also show you around the stage and take you on a behind-the-sceens look at the stage setup. They show a lot of the fans, of course (and the BSB with the fans - lucky fans!), and what the guys do back-stage and stuff. It's really cool. And some parts are hilarious - like at the end when they try to sing a really screwed-up Burger King version of ""I Want It That Way"" - Nick keeps cracking up and they have to start over again! And of course, at the end of their show (the guys have to quickly run onto the tour bus before all the fans come out and see them), they show Nick, AJ, Brian, Kevin, and Howie D. eating food from Burger King (surprise, surprise!). If you are a true fan of the Backstreet Boys (like me) then you will want this video. I also recommend (if you liked the video), the CDs that go along with the video. You can also get them here on Amazon.com and the price is really good! This video rocks and so does the BSB!",998697600,16,1658,4.200626959247649
7933742,5,B000059HWA,I highly encourage ANYONE to buy this video.  I saw this video and it gives so much information and I personally like Nick Carter and at the end of the video his voice cracks and all the bsb members are cracking up and its so hilarious!! I absolutly love this video!!!!,997401600,4,269,4.2745098039215685
7933743,5,B000059HWA,"You would think this video wouldn't be as great as the other BSB videos out because of the  price.  You would think it would be a really short video with the boys hardly being in it, and just takig about Burger King, but your wrong!  This video is AWESOME!  It has songs such as Shape of My Heart, Get Another Boyfriend, Back to Your Heart, All I Have to Give (yes, they do the hat dance!!), etc.... It also shows behind the scenes fottage of those five boys, including Nick and Brian playing basketball with Division 1 college basketball team Michigan State, Nick playing pinball while talking about the BSB comic, Kevin showing us fans the arena before the doors open for the show, and more!!  The best part, though, is at the VERY end when they are trying to do the Burger King song, and they keep having to edit it because Nick keeps cracking up!!  It is hilarious!  You guys HAVE to get this video, not only is it worth your time watching but it is also DEFINETLY worth the money spent!!",995500800,5,992,4.358695652173913
