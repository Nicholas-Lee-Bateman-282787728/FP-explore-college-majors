8129215,5,B000G73UR2,This anime was done by Bandai and Cartoon Network. This animation is about a rookie team of teenagers trying to win the IGPX (Immortal Grand Prix). They have high tech robot/hybrid speed mechas. You'll love the story and characters.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves great anime.,1279152000,2,286,5.085106382978723
8129216,4,B000G73UR2,"Anime is like an ocean. For every title that makes big waves, dozens float on by unnoticed. Some anime deserve to be lost underneath the waves like so much flotsam, but there are plenty of titles that pass us by that merit a second look. For me, IGPX is worth a closer look.

What makes IGPX a breath of fresh air is the voices. Watch enough dubbed anime and you'll steadily learn to recognize voices across several series. I was feeling bored with hearing Funimation's regular cast of VA that I reached into my shelf for IGPX to remedy that problem. The main character Takeshi is voiced by Hayley Joel Osmond, who you either know as ""the Kid from the 6th Sense"" or Sora from Kingdom Hearts. Plus, Michelle Rodriguez from her brief stint on Lost, as Liz. Always cool Steven Jay Blum as Cunningham. And Mark Hamill, the voice of the Joker and Fire Lord Ozai, playing Hamma.

This season is a nice and simple introduction to the world of IGPX. You get a good feel of the characters, and the races are entertaining enough. In between, there are some good character bits, and the regular problems of managing a rookie team in a pro-sport. The extras on this collection really shine, with commentary on the last episodes of the season, interviews with the creators of the show, and the microseries pilot. The only bad part is that it's Dub only, there's no option to switch to Japanese with subtitles.

Oh, and if you're wondering what the difference is between the ""Toonami Version"" and Uncut versions, they just toned down the swearing.

IGPX Season 1 is nice and worth looking into. And if you find it good enough to add to your collection, don't forget to check out Season 2, where things go into overdrive.",1262822400,,1706,4.565359477124183
8129217,5,B000G73UR2,"Ok so i've watch't the whole season on toonami and loved it and years later (now) i've finaly bought it and i'm so glad i did if you like robots,racing,fighting then you'll love this anime its about a boy named Takeshi and his team satomi and his co pilet's and his best friends Liz and Amy (and Luca!), that race in Igpx (imortal grand prix).

In this season they have just beaten the ig2 and are now in the big leage ig1 where there the rookies who try to rise to the top to be champions and along the way they fall into troble as in team work that needs improving and girlfriend problems but they pull together soon ehough.

Oh and onther great thing about this anime is that you can realate to the characters like in this season most peaople realate to river (a side character) who wants to be head pilot like takeshi but there manager ms.satomi dosent think its a good idea so that just makes river mad and it makes him stuggle to be there for the team.

And its cool how in such a short season you get a pretty good back story to every character which grows in the second season.

But trust me you won't be mad if you buy this unless you don't like anime racing robots or fighting then DONT buy this but if you do like it and buy it you won't regret it!",1218153600,5,1259,4.126530612244898
8129218,5,B000G73UR2,I saw this anime on toonami and i loved it from the start! This first season is really awsome its full of action in every episode and keeps you on the edge. All in all with this season and the second season there are 26 episodes. Unlike other animes where stuff doesn't make sence everything in this anime is specified and its not at all boring like others animes where they talk to much. I would recommend this anime to all who like action in thier anime!,1214352000,3,456,4.252873563218391
