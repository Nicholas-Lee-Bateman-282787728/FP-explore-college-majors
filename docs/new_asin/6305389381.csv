1031520,4,6305389381,"In the 70s and 80s, a group of British musicians and comedians got together again and again for the causes of charity and human rights, and selections from the shows became best-selling LPs and CDs with absurd double entendres as titles. The complete televised proceedings (minus a couple of Billy Connolly bits) are exhaustively documented in this reasonably-priced 3-DVD box set, together with many heretofore unreleased or rarely-seen performances.

If you like the performers involved (and I definitely do), you will enjoy their loose, good-humored sets and onstage interactions, as well as the comprehensive making-of documentary included. For some, it may be too much of a good thing, but I can't get enough.

There are ten short (3- or 4-minute) videos of performances posted on the Amazon product page, so you can preview the balls before buying. Video and audio quality leave something to be desired, but they won't take away too much from your viewing and listening pleasure.",1234656000,2,985,5.188679245283019
1031521,4,6305389381,I am a huge fan of British comics and am very happy for the U.S. release of the box. I have only one question for anyone who can help. Why were the Billy Connolly performances edited out of the first two balls?,1234483200,2,210,4.023809523809524
1031522,4,6305389381,"Kudos to those putting this DVD out. It's funny and it's great to see the musical acts. The only thing is, the video quality is so-so, and the sound has slight hiss, like VHS tapes. There's even a couple popping noises when the film cameras switch angles/reels a couple of times. Some of the image quality is good, while some is clearly taken from videotape masters. Weren't these shot originally on film? If so, I wonder why they didn't restore the film stock (film seems to be a lot easier to digitally clean up than videotape these days.)
Regardless, it's good to have these shows in one package. I give the package a B or maybe a B+. Good skits and really good music.",1234137600,2,671,4.419354838709677

1031524,5,6305389381,"This wonderful boxed set of the charity comedy concerts from 1976 through to 1991 contains some of the best live comedy/satire ever produced. Everybody will have their favourites, but two or three standout for me.

The four Yorkshire sketch is a masterpiece. Somehow I had never heard the Python original prior to seeing this version. So this remains my favourite. ""Our Dad used to slice us in two with bread knife""... etc etc.
However best of all is Peter Cook. We are so lucky that he performed at these shows and in particular that his marvellous skit on the Judges summing up of the Jeremy Thorpe (the then leader of the Liberal Party) related trial is captured on film as well as in sound - ""I would like to pay a personal tribute to Mr Thropes husband Miriam....""

Another excellent sketch that Cook contributes to is the one with John Cleese on the park bench. Cook has minutes of tedious dialogue (from his character E L Whisty) during which Cleese is trying to read the paper and getting more and more irratated with Cook. In fact at one point Cleese almost loses it and laughs. In the end Cooks dialogue is rewarded with a classic Cleese rant to which Cook replies ""How very interesting!"".

Rowan Atkinson makes a number of memorable appearances as previous reviewers have pointed out and many other well known comedians contribute ably to the whole proceedings.

The music DVD is a mixed bag, but there are some great moments. The rarity of seeing Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck performing on stage together on 'Further on up the Road' and Pete Townsend performing 'Pinball Wizard' solo being the highlights for me.

The boxed set is well packaged on four discs and the total running time is 581 mins (9 hours and 41 minutes), so you get a lot for your money.",1192752000,2,1766,4.611464968152866
1031525,4,6305389381,"The real reason to buy this video is to see Kate Bush and Dave Gilmour from Pink Floyd do an inspired live version of her hit ""Running Up That Hill."" She rarely performs live and so to have a documented visual of her performing before an audience is a real treat. The rest of the video and the music performances are so-so. Nice to see Joan Armatrading doing her usual wonderful work. Ruby Wax hosts it and has some funny lines. John Cleese puts in an appearance. Just buy it for Kate.",1018656000,5,485,4.282608695652174
1031526,4,6305389381,"Like its predecessors, this video is a blend of musical performances and some of the biggest names in British comedy.  While there is more emphasis on the musical performances this time around, there is still plenty of funny stuff.  Particularly funny is the backhanded ""tribute"" to John Cleese, who was instrumental in getting the series started.  Another one to look for is the ""shrubbery"" sketch, in which the performers can't seem to get their lines straight.",975369600,3,463,5.065789473684211
1031648,1,6305389381,"I'm a huge fan of British Comedy and really looked forward to this DVD.

I had no interest in watching the British Comedians discussing whether the forthcoming show would be good or not, them posing for photos for the press, their sitting in chairs rehearsing by reading from scripts, or watching the show's organizer talking on the phone trying to purchase a toy stuffed parrot for Python's famous Dead Parrot sketch. When we finally get to see some of the sketches the lighting is terrible, the filming grainy and the sound muddy and awful. Doing the Dead Parrot sketch the actors are so full of themselves that Cleese overacts and Palin can't keep a straight face. The quality visually and audibly was so bad that I couldn't waste my time watching the entire DVD.

Probably the most disappointing DVD I've ever watched.",1381968000,,822,4.78169014084507

They didn't say on their web-site that these weren't the versions originally cut for U.S. release back in the 80's.  I desperately wanted to see Neil Innes performing, ""Urban Spaceman"" again.  But it's not here.  Not even in the EXTRAS.  There are some things I don't remember seeing back then, and some of them are pretty note-worthy (I can't swear to seeing a pre-Dr. Who Sylvester McCoy do his red-hat and strip to his tidy-whiteys escape routine back then... but that was 25 years ago... the little gray cells are the first thing to go!!).  If they ever want to make a decent amount of money for Amnesty, I suggest they gather up all the bits that were shown in the U.S. version but left out of this, the original british (international?) version, and put them all in a new release.  My two cents.  Thanks.",1311292800,6,876,4.57051282051282
1031656,5,6305389381,"In comic books, it's the Justice League of America.  In rock music, it's the Traveling Wilburys.  In comedy, the supergroup was, and is, the changing team of players in the Amnesty International stage shows, the Secret Policeman's Balls.

Originally conceived by Monty Python's John Cleese as a simple and effective way to donate to Amnesty whilst hanging with his many comedy mates, the shows began with a one-off, Pleasure At Her Majesty's, where to the delight of London theatregoers, virtually all of their favourite stage and TV comedians banded together to basically do their respective greatest hits in an informal late-night setting.

The shows were a huge hit, the chance to see the already-legendary Peter Cook resurrect his miner-who-wanted-to-be-a-judge routine, to see the Goodies cavort to their recent chart-busting song, ""The Funky Gibbon"", or indeed to see the currently hot, hot, hot Monty Python team do the ""Parrot Sketch"" (in probably the most confident, commanding performances they ever gave), this combination, all these comics in one night, proved irresistible to audiences, and, as these things will do, spawned such sequels as The Secret Policeman's Ball, the wittily-titled The Secret Policeman's Other Ball, the increasingly-bizarre sounding The Secret Policeman's Third Ball, and indeed the somewhat terminal-sounding The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball.

These later incarnations attracted musical interludes from the likes of Pete Townshend, Sting, Bob Geldof, Phil Collins and so many more.

What was especially interesting to me was the cross-pollination that occurred in the comedy bits, when certain team members would be absent, and so Peter Cook would sub for Eric Idle in a Python sketch, just as Terry Jones would fill in for Dudley Moore in a Beyond The Fringe sketch (Dudley would finally join the gang in the Biggest Ball for a reunion with Peter, which, poignantly, would be their last live stage appearance together).

These are genuine variety shows, giving you everything from manic stand-up (the wonderfully engaging Alexei Sayle and Ben Elton) to pantomime (Rowan Atkinson doing a prototype Mr. Bean) to funny music (Neil Innes and Victoria Wood) to uproarious sketches (the very, very best work from not only Python and Cook and Moore but also those ""upstarts"" Fry and Laurie and French and Saunders!).

Regarding the bonus features, we see a rare performance of Monty Python's obscure ""Book Shop"" sketch, John Cleese giving it the full Basil Fawlty treatment, although Connie Booth as the customer, while earnest and lovely as always, doesn't play a glazed-eye loony nearly as well as, say,  Graham Chapman.  Python addicts are bound to crack up at how Cleese adopts his ""Whicker's World"" voice in the ""Philosophy"" sketch from Beyond The Fringe, alongside Jonathan Miller.  I daresay this collection shows John Cleese at his absolute peak (It may be I've just seen Fawlty Towers too many times, folks, I'm frankly sick of it!).

Back to the bonus features.  The documentary is especially nice, amongst the comments is a surprisingly serious, penetrating, even moving speculation from Rowan Atkinson regarding the future of the very concept of freedom of thought(!).  Apart from that one bleak (though relevant, vital, and intelligent) comment from Atkinson, this is a warm, informative documentary, absolutely perfect.

Oh, and Technophiles be warned: I don't think any of the films was digitally remastered (the Biggest Ball looks like a slightly worn VHS copy) but I personally don't care.  Anything including clips of Monty Python, Beyond The Fringe and the Goodies rehearsing as well as performing is gold to me, as indeed are the various face-offs in the sketches, those moments when a glaring Peter Cook or John Cleese confronts goofy Rowan Atkinson.  Wonderful.

Take it out, start anywhere you like, and you will see there is more than enough entertainment here for any one sitting.

We are most amused.",1307059200,,3962,5.26031746031746

1031759,4,6305389381,"Here's a quick review.  I loved the performances on here.  Its great to see Emo Phillips in rare form.  You have Monty Python, Beyond the Fringe, Spitting Image, and many others.  You have music performances by Sting, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Mark Knopfler, Chet Atkins, and Lou Reed.  Yet, it shows that this is not the complete films when you have one of the best performers not even shown on stage: Billy Connolly.  I loved his material from the Secret Policeman's Ball from 1979.  Its a shame that he has been almost redacted from the films except for a prominent mention in the featurette on the fourth disc.  This is pretty much the biggest reason why it doesn't deserve five stars in my opinion.  Had they had the decency to include the Big Yin, this would be a sure-fire five star.  If you ever see the full 1979 concert on VHS, you'll see what I mean.",1285632000,,889,4.5
1031760,1,6305389381,"I had previously owned the 1998 VHS release of The Secret Policeman's Ball, which was a re-issue of the theatrical UK film of 1980 bearing the same name. The original UK film runtime (according to sources I find on the internet) 94 minutes but the version included on this compilation is only 72 minutes. The omitted material includes two Billy Connolly bits, one of which was the song ""My Granny Was A Cripple In Nashville."" It was for this song (and *only* for this song) that I purchased this collection and so it is with great horror that I find that it is not here.

It is extremely disingenuous of the distributor not to advertise that these are not the original performances and that some material is not included. Given the advertised bonus material and rare footage I find it quite unfathomable that non-rare footage, namely part of the actual performance which has already seen wide release, was not included. I am not sufficiently familiar with the other shows to say whether they were also edited down, but I fear the worst. It is on the basis of these omissions and fears that I must give this product a very poor rating.",1279584000,16,1134,4.6138613861386135

1031762,3,6305389381,"I had been looking for the ""Balls"" series for a long time, so imagine my joy when I found what I thought was the complete set at a great price.  When I received the set, I sat down hoping to spend a Python-a-riffic evening of entertainment.  Although I wasn't completely disappointed, there was too much back round and not enough ""show"".  Sure, many of the classic skits were there, as well as some great music (Pete Townsend is outstanding!), there were incomplete bits that were either ""talked over"" in the included documentary, or left out altogether.  I was particularly dismayed that the entire ""I have a viper in this box"" skit with Peter Cook was chopped up. Still, its an alright collection.  One thing for sure, the video transfer is pretty bad.  I don't remember the original broadcasts being so poorly reproduced, but maybe that's my nostalgia talking.  Anyway, if you are a devoted Python fan, or have a craving to see Sting when he was really young, you will get some enjoyment out of this set.",1272412800,9,1007,4.655367231638418

Five stars for content, 3 stars for quality, which varies a lot, but is noticeably better than the VHS version.  There's quite a bit of profanity, so if that bothers you, be forewarned.  Pete Townshend's acoustic solos make these DVDs more than worth the price.  Sting's solo performances are incredible, too.  Phil Collins does ""Something in the Air Tonight"" with just piano and bass, and it's so taut and intense, it'll knock your socks off!  There's an alternate version of Monty Python's ""Parrot Sketch"" with a surprise ending.  Rowan Atkinson does his pianist sketch and a cleaned up version of ""Smut"" retitled ""Schoolmaster"".  John Cleese is hilarious, as always.  Fry and Laurie do ""Hedge"" and ""Silver Dick"". The list of sketches is really long:

1.  IMMEDIATELY you get dumped into watching the commentary of the show, evidently made for this copy, and the narrator is pointing out some of the highlights and backstory.  Since this is somewhat amusing and interesting, it was only worth -1 star instead of -2 for the incompetent turd who made it default to the commentary version.

2.  Okay, I do some reading while this thing plays in the background and live with it for about as long as the first show is supposed to be (over 1.5 hours I know) and figure I'll see the show next.  Meanwhile, the narrator keeps saying things like ""as you will see in a bit"" and ""you will see this when the regular play starts"" and other such hints.  And finally, it is over.  I've gotten some other stuff done I needed to do and now I'll watch my movie.

3. BUT NO!  It dumps out into the EXTRAS!  Not even to the second show (probably with commentary) on the disc.  -2 starts.

Badly done, incompetent and I'm considering sending it back since it was a gift.  Amnesty Int'l has its share of liberal fruits with pudding for brains, but this was really stupid.

Sure, I know the whines incoming.  Yep, I poked around and found my remote, but the batteries were dead and I didn't feel like running to get some.
