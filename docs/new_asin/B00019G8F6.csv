1981737,4,B00019G8F6,"The choice of the dances and the dancers is quite good, starting form the legendary Fonteyn-Nureyev partnership, extending to the creative and touching White Swan Pas de Deux of Cooper and Ambler. Incomparable masters  such as Makarova, Baryshnikov and Dowell, had naturally to be present in  this video when it is named daringly ""Great Pas de Deux"" but one  wonders why a pas de deux from the wonderful Maya Plisetskaya is not there.  Of course when excellence or greatness is mentioned in dance, there is one  great choreography and dancing which the video is lacking: ""Grand Pas  Classique"" from Sylvie Guillem and Manuel leGris, demonstrating the  best of the classical technique, with the ideal image of a dancer and  partnership. Instead of including two dances from the Prince of the Pagodas  with Darcey Bussell both,  a pas de deux from Paloma Herrera-Angel Corella  or another great one from ""Mayerling"" by Viviana Durante and Irek  Mukhamedov could have been chosen. It would be appropriate here to say that  the choice of Bessmertnova-Mukhamedov pas de deux from  ""Spartacus"" is excellent, and another legendary dancing and  partnership I believe. And again, the choice of the Wedding Pas de Deux  from ""Sleeping Beauty"" does not seem correct with the elderly  Kolpakova in the role of the teenager Aurora. As to conclude, this video is  a nice compilation of the great dancing of our age, but lacking maybe the  above-stated fine-tuning and some contemporary choreographies, but very  good regarding the presentation of the works and dancers, and is a pleasure  to watch.",959126400,97,1584,5.085603112840467

1981764,1,B00019G8F6,"I am sure that I would have enjoyed this DVD but unfortunately cannot watch it as it will not play on my machine.  I didn't realise it was specific to American region players.

Also really was put out to have to pay hefty custioms charge to Royal Mail to pick it up after having to make a special journey to sorting office.",1388966400,,323,4.193548387096774

1981766,3,B00019G8F6,"I received this DVD as a gift and thought it was okay, not great.  I enjoyed some of the selections such as Le Corsaire, Romeo and Juliet, and Swan Lake (Black Swan).  However, why on earth did they include a version of the White Swan pas de deux from Swan Lake that had two male dancers?  This is described as a DVD of classical dance, but that version is hardly classical.  I found that very disappointing.  I would also liked to have seen Giselle among the selections.  Why include two from The Prince of the Pagodas and nothing from Giselle?",1358640000,2,545,4.4
1981767,5,B00019G8F6,"An excellent selection for the serious follower of ballet.  Only the cream of the crop
are represented here dancing some of the most exciting pas de deux on record. If you love
ballet, you will love this.",1348790400,4,204,4.513513513513513
1981788,4,B00019G8F6,"It's great dancing, I love classic ballet, but the pieces are too old, nothing from recent performances. Also I didn't really care for the Swan Lake performed by two male dancers; I did like the second version though, performed by The Kirov Ballet (there are two performances of Swan Lake on the DVD). I love the Nutcracker, my favorite ballet and music of all times, but the stage props and outfits by the Royal Ballet dancers were ""washed out,"" no contrast, a bit bland like the British food.

Most of the ballerinas did excellent performances. It always amazes me as to how strong their legs, knee joints and posture as a whole must be in order to do these stunning and graceful turns, bends, stands, etc., ect., those definitely merit a 5 star for the DVD, but a few things I didn't care for, that's why the 4 star rating. Also most male dancers did excellent jumps and splits in the various pieces, Baryshnikov being totally in control of his dancing - kudus for him.

All in all, if you like classic ballet it's definitely a nice addition to your reportiore. Even with some of my dislikes, I'll keep watching the DVD until I grow tired of it which won't be too soon. For the price it's a pretty good show, second to being there in person, and you can select the pieces you like if some don't appeal to you.",1326499200,5,1312,4.439834024896266
1981789,4,B00019G8F6,"The numerous Pas de De Deux of this DVD are (most of them) marvealous, i believe the selection was made with care. It also compiles dances from 1950's to nowdays. I definatley recomend it",1299801600,,187,4.529411764705882

1981792,5,B00019G8F6,"The great thing about this DVD is the variety of performances, all of exceptional quality, by great dancers. I knew what to expect from the ever-wonderful Fonteyn and Nureyev, and have been lucky enough to see Maria Bylova on stage with the Bolshoi, but still Bylova's performance in Spring Waters blew me away; and Lesley Collier in The Nutcracker was a revelation. I'll watch this DVD often (especially the performances mentioned) because it's wonderful to see such beauty captured on film.",1231200000,2,492,5.08641975308642
1981793,4,B00019G8F6,"I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS DVD FOR THE EXPERIENCED VIEWER OF LIVE OR DVD PERFORMANCES OF BALLET. IT IS A COMPENDIUM MOST SUITED TO THE PERSON OF ANY AGE WHO HAS NOT BEEN MUCH EXPOSED TO CLASSIC DANCE NOR COLLECTED FULL PERFORMANCE DVD'S.
YES, THE TITLE IS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING, MORE ACCURATE WOULD A SUB5ITLE SUCH AS ""SAMPLES FROM SOME OF THE LEADING BALLET COMPANIES"" OR ""A PRIMER FOR BEGINNERS IN VIEWING DANCE"".
FOR THE PURPOSES I OUTLINE, MY ONLY QUARREL IS WITH THE UNEVEN LENGTHS OF THE SELECTIONS. BETTER TWO OR THREE FEWER AND MORE TIME FOR THE REMAINING ONES. AS IT IS, TWO OR THREE ARE FRUSTRATINGLY SHORT WHILE NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD BE SAID TO BE TOO LONG.
HOWEVER, MARKETING GOALS PROBABLY DICTATED A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITEMS WITH SUFFICIENT TIME FOR MOST TO AVOID THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE ""COMING ATTRACTIONS"" OR PREVIEWS.
THE VIRTUE FOR THE BEGINNER IS THAT ALL THESE SELECTIONS ARE GOOD TO LOOK AT AND GOOD TO HEAR, ALL THE PERFORMERS HIGHLY COMPETENT, AND ALL THE SEGMENTS AVAILABLE (BY SOME GROUP OF GOOD PERFORMERS) FOR PURCHASE OR RENTAL.",1218153600,,1056,4.713513513513513
1981794,4,B00019G8F6,"I am in no way an expert on ballet, but enjoy watching performances for the beauty and grace of the dancers as well as the humorous portions of some.  This is a collection of excerpts from several ballets and is delightful in and of itself.  I bought the DVD because Baryshnikov is the male lead on one track of ""Don Quixote"".  Enjoyable viewing.",1215993600,,346,4.4603174603174605
1981795,3,B00019G8F6,"No doubt, the dancing is superb. However, most ballets were recorded some time ago; consequently the audio is generally not very good. One selection is awful: The Nutcracker. Both the quality of the film and the audio are bad. One wonders why they included it on the DVD. Nevertheless for a lover of ballet this DVD is worthwhile purchasing.",1198281600,2,341,4.796610169491525

1981797,3,B00019G8F6,"It is hard to explain why, but I was disappointed with this DVD. For some reason, every time I want to watch a ballet performance, I choose one of my other ballet DVDs (such as Kirov celebrated Nijinsky, or Kirov Classics).",1176681600,4,223,4.463414634146342
1981808,3,B00019G8F6,"This is simply a DVD version of a video released some years ago (aprox. 5-8 years ago?) so the newer partnerships mentioned in some of the reviews above, and already released on other DVDs (and copyrighted by their producers) would not have been available for inclusion.  However, what is included are several exemplary pas de deux danced by some of the best dancers of the last 30+ years.  If you haven't seen them live, this is a good chance to view them at their best, and be able to compare to other (more current) interpretations and see how changing forms and style have impacted ballet.",1169164800,9,593,4.6380952380952385

1981812,3,B00019G8F6,"The title of this video, ""Great Pas De Deux"" was apt for most of the dancing.  I was disappointed, however, when the editors of this video chose as the exemplar of ""Swan Lake"", my favorite ballet, a ""gay"" version of the ballet with both leads danced by men. What a let down! I would not recommend this video.",1156032000,10,308,4.310344827586207
1981813,5,B00019G8F6,"This is a great DVD that has a pretty nice collection of pas de deuxs over the years.  It's organized very easily, and the menu system is very easy to access and use.

The quality of the video varies, but they all look better than average even on a HDTV set.  It's formatted in 4:3 ratio.

I think I will watch this DVD often since I can't really sit through a whole performance which takes about 2 hours.",1130889600,10,405,4.153846153846154
1981814,1,B00019G8F6,"I was shocked to see Tchaikovsky's classic danced exclusively by males.  One reviewer felt that the result was a ""human""-- not merely  ""romantic""-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler.",1129680000,24,535,4.578947368421052
1981815,4,B00019G8F6,"In this DVD, I saw some dancers for the first time. They were very different from the ones I knew with the Company of Opera de Paris in Paris, France. But they, not all, were excellent.

And I knew again how talented Baryshnikov was. I have this  complete Don Quixote that Baryshnikov danced in this DVD. If you

have an occaison, his Don Quixote is worth to be watched entirely.",1121817600,5,379,4.385714285714286
1981816,4,B00019G8F6,"This DVD is a collection of 15 Pas de deux covering a time span of 31 years. (1965-1996). It includes such well know ballet stars as Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Makhalina, and Asylmuratova to mention a few.
The entire compilation tries to focus on presenting the performers when they were in their prime. For instance the segment featuring Nureyev and Fonteyn was recorded in 1965 and although the picture is a little grainy, it is more than adequate to give us a glimpse of what these artists could do when they were at their best.
Some of my favorite pieces were...
- Spring Waters with Maria Bylova and Leonid Nikonov; with their fast paced,energetic leaps and lifts.
- Romeo and  Juliet (balcony scene) with Alessandra Ferri and Wayne Eagling; an early example of Ferri's  acting and interpretation skills that we would continue to see develop, in the years to follow.
- Swan Lake (Black Swan scene) with Julia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky; Makhalina show us (as Odile) just how poised, incredibly flexible and talented she really is in this role. She is simply stunning.
-and last but not least the Don Quixote pas de deux with Cynthia Harvey and Mikhail Baryshnikov. This features some of Baryshnikov's world famous leaps and spins. Enough said!
There were a couple of segments that I didn't enjoy as some of the others; but that would to be expected in a ""sampling"" of a series of pas de deux. Also a couple of dancers and choreographers were featured multiple times(3); this I found a little puzzling on a relatively short, one disc recording.
An enjoyable DVD and although the video quality my change a bit from one performance to the next, you still have to feel grateful just being able to watch and appreciate some of the greatest dancers of the last century.",1077148800,152,1764,4.761437908496732
1981817,3,B00019G8F6,"The choices were okay, not great. I found the picture on the video cover misleading. The particular pas de deux featured from the Prince of the Pagodas is not actually included in the video so I don't know why it is on the cover.  The choice of dancers and ballets leaves a lot to be desired. I have seen better performances of some of the ballets by other dancers.  Overall, this collection feels more like a promotional video than one of historical or artistic significance.  The collection includes: ""Spring Waters"" Bylova and Nikonov.  ""Le Corsaire"" Fonteyn and Nureyev. ""The Prince of the Pagodas"" Bussell and Cope.  ""Swan Lake"" Cooper and Ambler.  ""Romeo and Juliet"" Ferri and Eagling.  ""Nutcracker"" Collier and Dowell.  ""Manon"" Penney and Dowell.  ""Swan Lake"" Makhalina and Zelensky.  ""A Month in the Country"" Makarova and Dowell.  ""Le Corsaire"" Asylmuratova and Neff.  ""Spartacus"" Mukhamedov and Bessmertova.  ""The Sleeping Beauty"" Kolpakova and Berezhnoi.  ""Don Quixote"" Havey and Baryshnikov.",984268800,101,1002,5.2594936708860756

8008492,4,B00019G8F6,"The best things about this DVD are you get to see several famous ballet dancers (including three pairings with my favorite male danseur noble Anthony Dowell of England's Royal Ballet, who I was fortunate enough to see with his partner Antoinette Sibley in person in NYC several times in the '70s), all are filmed in color, and the angles are pretty close up for viewer appreciation of the dance steps.  The worst are that each pas de deux is 10 minutes or less and seem to fly by, some ballet scenes are not the best (as one reviewer stated, Darcey Bussell's scene in Prince of the Pagodas is not the one on the DVD cover, and she spends the entire dance BLINDFOLDED which detracts from her beauty), and having two male dancers perform a Swan Lake scene while trendy, is a disappointment for the classic ballet fan like myself when there were so many wonderful male/female duos in those roles.  Otherwise, its a pleasant ballet DVD that is nice to watch while I'm on my exercise bike.",1480464000,3,984,4.553672316384181
