8212136,5,B00005MJTJ,"I consider myself an intermediate level fitness person, but Gin demonstrates moves for even a beginner in this one.  Man! She called all the moves excellently.  When I finish this tape I feel like I have worked out.  I choose this over all my other tapes even my new FIRM tapes. (which I simply loved) I bought Gin's Extreme Step after I saw this one and was serverely disappointed.  I'm hoping that other tapes from Gin will be as awesome as this one.",1041552000,,452,4.409638554216867
