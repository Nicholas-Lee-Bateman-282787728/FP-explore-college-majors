8548350,5,B00A8NNQZK,"I have been looking for a fly tying video on midges for some time, and was pleased to find this one by Davy Wotton.  A couple years ago I had the opportunity to attend a class on European Nymphing that he taught at the FFF conclave in Mountain Home, Arkansas, and I also attended a day of instruction he put on in St. Louis at an Ozark Fly Fishers event last year.  On both occasions I learned a great deal and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Davy Wotton is a true master of fly fishing and is a great teacher.  This fly tying DVD is excellent, and one that every fly fisher who pursues trout should own.  I highly recommend it.",1359331200,,632,4.233333333333333
