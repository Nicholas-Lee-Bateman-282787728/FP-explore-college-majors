5334659,4,B009GYTP3O,"Now I've recently gotten into this show thanks to the first DVD and I have nothing but positive things to say about it. The show touches on a lot of levels of humor and if you don't find one joke funny then there's another one following right after that makes up for it. As usual with Cartoon Network DVDs the special features leave much to be desired, this time having a measly character gallery. The other thing that drags this down is that it, like the first DVD, is misleading. The twelve episodes are actually eleven minute segments that come out to just over two hours.

For the price it is a pretty good deal, and since the first season is thirty eight segments that leads me to believe there will be one last DVD to complete the season. Luckily there's no continuity in the show so the fact that the segments were divided up is not as bad as it could be, but I would have enjoyed watching the shorts in order.

Good show, good price. Worth the purchase.",1358121600,10,961,4.333333333333333

5334672,5,B009GYTP3O,"This animated series is the definition of zany wacky cartoons. Sometimes, you'll get a callback or reference to a previous episode, which adds some continuity to this world, but they're mostly random hilarious shorts. This was made to be like a best-of dvd, but it's been confirmed that all of Season 1 can be owned by collecting these three Amazing World of Gumball dvds: The DVD, The Mystery, and The Party.",1423612800,3,409,4.774647887323944

5334675,5,B009GYTP3O,"The original season of Gumball is genius level humor. I love all the quirks and humor for both children and adults. A+ stuff.

This DVD is basically just barebones; there is no HD version available, and no extra content to get into with the discs. Its just Gumball, plain and simple. I'd like HD, but the type of graphics this cartoon is drawn in scale up well with interpolation on players.",1414108800,,391,4.507042253521127

5334688,3,B009GYTP3O,"Welcome back to the so-called amazing world of a little cat who tries to play it cool.  It's a brand-new DVD starring Gumball Watterson and the craziest cast you can imagine in 12 more episodes such as:

""The Mystery"" - Gumball discovers a seemingly unrecognizable Principal Brown in his locker.  Now Gumball must muster up his detective skills to figure out who could do such a thing.
""The Responsible"" - Their parents trust Gumball and Darwin to look after Anais while they leave for a parent-teacher conference.  What could possibly go wrong ?
""The Spoon"" - Gumball and Darwin become unsuspecting participants in a convenience store caper.
""The Microwave"" - After collecting all sorts of disgusting things in a jar, Gumball and Darwin decide to pop it in the microwave and see what happens.  The end result is rather monstrous.
""The Club"" - Gumball desperately wants to join a club at school, but no one wants him.
""The Dress"" - Gumball wears a dress and suddenly becomes the most popular kid in school.  Unfortunately, Darwin develops a crush on what he thinks is the new girl.
""The Pressure"" - Gumball and Darwin promise each other not to let girls get in their way of brotherly friendship, but what happens when a girl asks them to kiss her ?!

Bonus feature is a character gallery of the students and staff of Elmore Junior High.

So if you wanna see a world that's beyond your imagination, perhaps discrimination, and maybe comprehension, then ""The Amazing World of Gumball"" is pretty much up your alley.  Don't forget to tune in to new episodes of this and more on Cartoon Network.",1358640000,,1590,4.731884057971015

And Amazon definitely gave a great deal for a DVD this amazing!!! It was definitely worth the buy! As the other DVD, there are only 12 episodes, but that's ok! They were greatly chosen and put into order in a way to introduce people that are new to the show, and basically shows the episodes from greatest to.....greatest! They are all amazing episodes! If you're like me and love the show, and want to share it with you kids, buy the DVD!!! It's worth it!",1358553600,,586,4.385321100917431
