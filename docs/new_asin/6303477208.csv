7849012,5,6303477208,"This dramatisation is a forgotten gem, far superior to the more recent BBC version, and with an ending that is far closer to what Dickens probably had in mind,
It is suffused with a darkly atmospheric tension, with some fine set-pieces, notably John Jasper's macabre wooing of Drood's former fiance in the grounds of her school, and the mysterious goings on in the parish church during the storm..
Well acted, with good production values and authentic settings and costumes. Acting honours go to Robert Powell as Jasper, Andrew Sachs as Durdles, and Glyn Houston as Mr. Grewgious.
A great pity that this film was widely available in the United States only; British viewers will have to hunt hard for a copy, and they're not cheap.",1384905600,,730,4.848
7849013,5,6303477208,"This 1993 version of Charles Dickens last and unfinished novel is very dark and quite atmospheric.
Robert Powell is absolutely perfect in the role of John Jasper, with his visible politeness, correctness, but his dreadful and threatening looks !
A must-see, if you are a Dickens fan !",1362355200,2,284,4.9375
