615702,1,6303258395,"do we need to watch this deadbeat movie? is there director here? what a lousy script. the daughter talked to her mom in english, her mom only answered in cantonese dialect? if the mom understood english, why she never responded in english? so the husband also talked to this wife in english, but she also only answered in cantonese? this movie is in a slow-motion speed. drives you nuts. typically formatted cliches from the very beginning. bored me to death. there are lot of still-life like scenes, such as bird cage, chinese paintings, flower on the table, shoes on the doorstep, again and again, what's the big deal? is there any art in showing some shoes, even plastic shoes to the viewers? any philosophic depth or meaning here? nada. but, if you think you think life is not short and you could afford wasting couple of hours, go ahead, rent it, buy it, watch it, i could not care less.",1137888000,,892,4.58125
615703,2,6303258395,"This movie has been called a Chinese-American Terms of Endearment, and it's supposed to be about a Chinese-American family trying to maintain a link to their cultural heritage while confronted with the changing world around them. Isn't that what they say about ALL the Chinese-American movies, and even most of the Chinese movies? Are the Chinese the only culture in the world in which traditions are being challenged and changed? I think not.

Anyway, this movie is not at all like Terms of Endearment. The mother and daughter in this story do not have a love/hate relationship that needs resolution. They are devoted to each other throughout, and not because of traditional filial duty. This story did not showcase any strong conflicts between cultural heritage and a changing world; there was actually less conflict than is normally expected between any two generations. The plot was slow, unexciting, and not provocative in any way. Interestingly, one Chinese daughter seemed to have a mixed black child, but we saw her for only a moment and then she was gone. We never did get to meet the dad, so maybe we're supposed to infer that one daughter who was a minor character had married a black man, and that is a so-called break from tradition. But the mother didn't seem to have any problem with it. All in all, this movie is a sleeper, and I don't mean the successful kind.",1128470400,,1377,4.785714285714286
615704,4,6303258395,"I liked this movie because it reflected ideas and interactions between family in a quiet peaceful way. It would show pictures of nature and meditate on them, letting the camera sit with a scene. It didn't rush or stress to make a point. The viewer could ponder the movie in a nice sort of way. The close up shots of shoes being left outside of the house, would symbolize the Chinese tradition still being honored in America. The shots were slow and unhurried, letting the images make a point. Helping to get a bigger picture of what the director was wanting to reflect. The Chinese culture and the interactions between the mother and her children were all done shown in a rhythm that clicked with the overall theme. Nicely done. Directed by well-known Wayne Wang. He has done Blue in the Face, Center of the World, to name a few!

615705,4,6303258395,"It is hard to decide if ""Dim Sum:A Little Bit of Heart"" is a good movie or not.  It is a very low-budget, slice-of-life film that shows a Chinese-American family living in San Francisco during the 1980s.  There is no false drama imposed on the family, and their life is no more exciting than mine.  The dialog is realistic, with awkward pauses and such.  The mother speaks mostly sub-titled Chinese, although the rest of the characters speak mostly English.  There are some minor plot points.  The mother, who thinks that she will die when she is 62 because of a fortune tellers prophecy, would like to see her daughter get married.  Often, they just have dinner and chat.  Sometimes they watch TV.
And that is the hard part.  ""Dim Sum:A Little Bit of Heart"" can be down-right boring.  Nothing really happens.  It is just a few days in the life of a family, and not particularly eventful days at that.  The characters all seem like nice people.  Victor Wong, who I always like, is charming as ever.  It is nice to see him in a lead role.  The film is very dated.  Each item of clothing screams 1980.  It seems like a student film, and perhaps it was.
I think that if I had been a Chinese-American living in San Francisco in the 1980s, then there would be more in this film for me.  All the cast is talented, and many appear in the most excellent ""Joy Luck Club"" by the same director.  The ending is very heart warming, and worth sitting through the whole film for.
All in all, I recommend ""Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart."" with some reservations.  Know what you are getting yourself in for.",1018915200,4,1590,4.417241379310345
7842490,1,6303258395,I'm assuming that there are NO SUBTITLES for the parts which aren't in English because I'm not allowed to turn subtitles on in settings.,1480377600,,136,4.708333333333333
7842491,5,6303258395,This has all the feel of a family in S.F. I lived there for some years and I love to watch this movie to remind me of The City. Plus the interaction with the Chinese Mom and daughter is so alike my own Latin family.,1459641600,,215,3.8
7842492,3,6303258395,"It's a very, very slow movie revolving around a Chinese-American family in San francisco, yet it held a certain charm for me. I think that it would appeal mostly to persons interested in other cultures. It has practically no plot development yet, again, it's vaguely appealing (I know that there were a lot of details that went right over my head). I was particularly amused about the fact that most of the characters, being bilingual, go back and forth between English and Chinese (sometimes in mid sentence)something that is commonplace with many Hispanic families and educated families in Pakistan and India.

The plot as such is a generation gap between the tradition bound mother (who cannot speak English even though she's been in the US for 40 years) and her hen friends and the younger generation. A fortune teller told her she would die at 62 and she is putting even more pressure on her daughter to get married---asap. Her friends are also urging the daughter to get married. In between is victor Wong, the mother's contemporary, who keeps saying that the good in Chinese culture should be retained while the other junk be jettisoned, but the mom simply won't change.",1422662400,,1177,4.855721393034826
7842493,1,6303258395,"I watched this with a girl from China, and she fell asleep.

First of all, a lot of Cantonese.  No Mandarin.  Of course there are English subtitles, so it doesn't matter that much, but I personally prefer to hear the national language, which is Mandarin.  Still, I suppose they kept it more authentic by keeping it Cantonese, considering the subject and setting.  Anyway, just my personal preference.

Second... it so obviously tries WAY too hard to be ""artistic"" with long, drawn-out scenes of landscape, or just water, or just a shot of a sewing machine next to an open window, etc.  With this movie, I certainly wasn't expecting an explosion or fight every five minutes, but the effort to symbolize almost every scene with ""deep"" or ""meaningful"" images where nothing is being said and nothing is happening, left me feeling robbed of my time.  I get what the movie was TRYING to do.  But it took WAY too long to convey WAY too little.

Next, filmed in the 80's, the hair and clothing made me cringe and was a bit of a distraction.

Lastly, the lack of dialogue, development and history of the main characters was painful to watch.  I kept waiting patiently the entire movie for more dialogue.  I wanted to know everyone's story.  Instead there were long, quiet scenes of two people in a room, exchanging three sentences over five minutes.

The movie ended as uneventfully and awkward as it started.  I can't imagine anyone finding this movie to be one of their favorites, or even recommending it to anyone else.",1357171200,,1513,4.695817490494297
7842494,5,6303258395,"For the person that thought this movie was a bomb... I'm really sorry that you don't get what the director is trying to show you in this movie.  In your case maybe you should stick with the mainstream films like ""Joy Luck Club"" where you get a hollywood perspective of what Chinese people are like.  For me I first saw this film for an Asian American Studies class in college.  I still believe this film is as timeless as they come.  Wayne Wang really captured what daily life was like for Chinese Americans and their immigrant parents.  What was portrayed was a very comfortable middle class life that they aspired to.  Like the Richmond neighborhood that was pictured (before the housing boom)in the movie.  It also shows the frugal and mundane lives of the characters.  I feel like I know each and every one of them either as a relative or as a friend. Especially the mom which is pretty typical of all Chinese moms and grannies of a certain age.  I really miss people like that.  What some people don't see is that the director managed to capture a generation of Chinese Americans in the mom that we call ""The Old Timers"".  Not too many of them are still alive, it is nice to know that there is a film that does represent what they looked and sounded like.",1286668800,3,1260,4.434782608695652
7842495,3,6303258395,"If you're about to watch this movie via Amazon's Video on Demand, be forewarned that the Chinese speech in this movie (about a third of the total dialogue) is lacking subtitles.  I imagine that the DVD version has an option to turn on the subtitles, but the Video on Demand version lacks such customization.  Nevertheless, we watched this movie last night and still found it mildly enjoyable even without understanding the Chinese (Cantonese) dialogue.",1279843200,,452,5.094594594594595
7842496,4,6303258395,"DIM SUM is one of those films that you really have to be in the right space to appreciate.  Thankfully, I was in that space and I enjoyed it very much!  Director Wayne Wang cast a real life mother and daughter (Kim Chew and Laureen Chew) as his two leads--62 year old Mrs. Tam and her daughter, Geraldine.  Mrs. Tam has reached the point in her life where she wants to make a pilgrimage to China to pay her final respects to her ancestors, while her daughter remains unmarried and takes care of her, as they live together as a family unit.  We get a sense of the cultural struggles of women in this country (particularly women of bicultural heritage, like Geraldine, who is American-born, with a mother who remains close to her Chinese values).  It is also a quietly humorous and gentle journey through their relationship's ups and downs.  Though, I noticed that some people criticized it for being ""uneventful,"" I beg to differ.  I think this film is charming in its direct and non-flamboyant style and subject matter and that was something I greatly enjoyed.  Very well done.",1186790400,8,1077,4.631578947368421
7842497,4,6303258395,"This movie gives the viewer an intimate slice of the Chinese-American experience in the 80s.  If you are looking for a chop-socky movie or a ""beat you over the head with 2 by 4s to spell out what the images and meanings are"" movie, this is simply not for you.  Instead, go see a Beavis and Butthead episode.

Even in the fast past hustle of the western world, the movie shares how Asians are often able to maintain a serene life flow while facing important aspects regarding the end (mother) and continuation (daughter) of life issues.  By dispensing with pre-conceived expectations and seeking the meanings behind what the director is conveying, the viewer can gain a entry into this quiet, quaint, and accurate world of this family.

Viewed from an undiscerning mind with old western prejudices, this movie has no value.  If you want to gain entry into the world of these Chinese characters and gain invaluable understandings, see and question every cultural aspect that the director shares with his viewers.  In the end, you'll learn and understand a little bit how the majority of the world's population deal with life's issues.",1157673600,4,1132,4.864583333333333

7842499,5,6303258395,"When I first saw this in 1985, it was the first time I saw on the big screen a genuine portrayal of the Asian American experience.  I fell in love with this film. At last!  My experience and my culture in commercial media. It rang so true to me, and I was and am thankful that Wayne Wang created such a gem.  There are many beautiful shots in this film, and detailed depictions of Chinese American life: ie, the shoes at the front door, which is typical of Chinese American households; the bird cage with the red paper character luck placed upside down, meaning luck will descend upon you (unfortunately such details went right over the head of the reviewer below).  The Cantonese is a bonus, it's my native language, and there it is in film, and lots of it.
I saw Chan is Missing later, and that, of course, is another landmark film, portraying the diversity in the Chinese American and Asian American community.",1138752000,17,913,4.515151515151516
