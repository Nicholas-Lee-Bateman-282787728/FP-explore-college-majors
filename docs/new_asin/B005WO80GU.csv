Art book in excellent condition along with the disk that wasn't blu ray by the way. Other than the blu ray part, all in all, it is exactly what you payed for.",1388707200,,324,4.0
8488050,3,B005WO80GU,"Pretty disappointed with this series.  It had the potential to be so much better than it was.  If it's ever given a thorough overhaul/remake then I will give it another chance, but I'm not gonna hold my breath, since it seems like a lot of people enjoy it the way it is.

The first half was promising, but I feel like they should have cut it off at the midway point, because after the halfway point where a certain major event takes place, the story gets really nonsensical, drawn out in some places, rushed in other places, several characters are made unlikeable, and ultimately things are only given half-assed explanations or else no explanation at all.

The visuals are beautifully done, and the music is good; perhaps the thing I like most about the show is two of the songs that were in it, ""Bios"" and ""Hill of Sorrow.""  I don't often try to look up the songs from anime online after I watch a show, but I felt compelled to find out the names of these songs because they are pretty cool.

I did like the characters Segai Makoto and Kenji Kido.  It did feel like they were consistent characters throughout the series, and their stories had appropriate outcomes, I thought.

Despite the attention that was given to both Shu and Inori, I did not find myself able to care much about them, due to Inori's flatline personality and Shu's unappealing character flaws.  Several other central characters, particularly friends of theirs, changed their attitudes towards certain things way too easily for me to take them seriously; and other people, like Gai, took certain actions that felt so poorly out of character for them that it was almost unbearable to sit through.  It also irritated me that Gai looked and acted much older than Shu, and was like twice his height, yet they were both supposed to be the same age.  And don't get me started on the line about one character supposedly having been a ""child soldier in Africa.""  That was a total WTF moment right there that was not even close to adequately explained.

Daryl Yan was an interesting character, but he did not have enough screen time; they should have either left him out completely or else given him more involvement in the story, because the intense drama of the few scenes he was in made me want to learn more about him, and I actually found myself caring somewhat about what happened to him.  I also think that Mana should have been woven into the story far earlier, for greater effect.  I think the story would have had much more gravity and felt more dire if we had known the overall situation much earlier in the series, because the way the Apocalypse virus seems to work is creepy as hell.  And there should have been more inclusion of Da'at, rather than it being sort of tacked on like some sort of afterthought.  Really interesting concept material to work with there, but they just didn't use it to its full potential.

Overall, I suppose if you have nothing to do, it's an ok way to kill some time.  But don't expect to be satisfied by most aspects of it by the ending, because you may very well be disappointed like I was.  I really wanted to like this series, but they just didn't do it right.",1366243200,,3168,4.53427065026362
8488051,2,B005WO80GU,"Before it's release, Guilty Crown was touted around as possibly being one of the best animes of the year and it was compared to many other animes such as Code Geass, which holds an acceptable record among anime enthusiasts. I decided to see what this anime was all about.

Basically the premise of the story is of high school kid (no really?) trying to save the world from utter destruction of the hands of a group that plans to eliminate the human race.

First off, the animation is excellent. No shortcuts were taken in it's creation and it shows, with it's smooth flow, artwork, etc. I really can't fault the guys who drew this, just plain beautiful. They really outdid themselves. 5/5

In the sound department they also didn't falter. They put in great efforts in the soundtrack from the opening to end. The voice actors also seem to represent their characters well to their best of abilities. I did find a few annoying representations, but it's most likely do to the poor characters (I'll get to that soon.) 4/5

Characters. Ahh yes. The characters. If you've seen Code Geass, you'd notice that the more interesting part of that anime were the main characters. Code Geass' main characters were actually interesting and felt somewhat ""real"" because you could relate to some of them. You could just feel the hatred Lelouch had in his heart towards those who wronged him. In Guilty Crown, it fails. Badly. The characters seem so detached and out of touch in my opinion, that I really didn't care for any of them other than maybe one, who wasn't even a main character!!! The main character in GC, Shu is so incompetent, uninteresting and just plain boring I don't understand how the guys who wrote this thought he'd be an acceptable main character. His love interest, Inori, isn't any better! She lacks character completely. She's basically a pretty face with your typical woe is me background. There are many other weak characters in this anime, but to make a long story short, most lack originality, actual character and depth. Heck if they even weren't original they could have at least made their background a lot deeper. If this were some kind of harem anime I would understand the lack of depth, but sheesh this is just bad. Deserves a 1/5 extremely poor.

Story. You thought the characters were bad? The story is big mash up of just plain garbage. There are so many plot holes in this anime that I can't begin to describe and to top it off the way they explain it in the anime (when they try to) when Shu ""gains"" a new ability is ""I don't know how I'm able to do this now, but I just can."" What kind of explanation is that!!! Also, it almost always seems to turn in the main characters favor one way or another. In one part Shu's arm gets torn off and then in the next episode they put it right back with this new uber cool arm made of crystal, which just so happens to just happen at the right time. It seemed like the writers in this anime just wrote everything out as the anime episodes went along. There isn't really any flow to the story at all. Terrible! Even in Code Geass the story wasn't great, but at least the characters made up for the shortcomings. I give the story a 1/5.

In conclusion, GC in my opinion is a rather poor copy of Code Geass. Shu is a terrible main character, the story line is complete garbage and it's barely a step above complete utter garbage due to the their efforts in the animation and music department. Don't waste your time with this anime, unless you really like mecha (which weren't that impressive anyways) or just want to burn some hours of your life for...nothing really. I give this anime a 1.5 out of 5. I do not recommend.",1344038400,,3677,4.505247376311844
8488052,5,B005WO80GU,"Note:  I only saw the Japanese dubbed version with English subs.

I saw mixed reviews of this show on another site, and at first I started to agree with the negative reviews, until somewhere around episode 6.  I did not think this show could turn my opinion around, but it did - and it still amazes me that it did.

What starts out as predictable sci-fi/supernatural tripe turned into a truly beautiful and heart-breaking love story (actually, ""stories"").  The drama gets dark, especially in the middle, which can also be typical fare for this type of genre, but it didn't turn me off.  It was upsetting to see, but the delivery was so well done that I didn't mind at all.  In fact, it pulled me in and stabbed me in the gut...and I wanted more.

One thing that greatly surprised me was the music.  The musical score and the soundtrack are top notch.  I'm still trying to find a copy of the closing song ""Departure"", which is played as closing credits on the first 12 episodes.  I usually fast forward thru the opening credits and closing credits, but not with those great songs.

The animation is the best I have seen, period.  The style is perfect; the characters are crazy cute without being ""bug-eyed""; the CG is not overly done; the fight scenes are enthralling; and the backgrounds are beautiful.

Truly, the production of this anime is one of the best (if not ""The Best"") I have experienced.  I was going to give this 4 stars, due to the typical anime story setup, but I can't.  When an anime has me as entertained as this one, and the characters have me so concerned for them that I want to jump in and help (or slap some sense into them), I can't give the show anything less than 5 stars.  That's just me.  I give shows ratings on their entertainment value, and try not to write reviews that simply pick apart its weaknesses.  The weaknesses are there, for sure.  But I've never seen an actual ""perfect"" show or movie, either.

Some will shoot me down with this review, call me a ""fanboy,"" etc.  And that's okay.  I guess I AM a fanboy, seeing that I do like anime - no other form of entertainment gets under my skin quite like anime for some reason (immaturity, maybe? lol).  I would bet that the detractors of this show disliked it mainly because they just couldn't get past the played out setting and anime-architypical characters.  I guess I can't blame them, as it is ""anime-formula"" heavy.  For me though, it was a fun ride - entertaining and heartfelt.

Go into it expecting that you'll instantly recognize the ""nice high school boy with all the hotties in love with him - though he doesn't notice - and has some special power"" plot.  Once you get past that initial ""insult"", you may be moved (or at least entertained) by this sci-fi drama and fall in love with the characters, as I did.",1339027200,2,2803,4.47534516765286
