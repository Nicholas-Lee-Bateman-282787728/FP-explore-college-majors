1758937,5,B00006HCFD,"The protagonist, Andrei Kmicic, is a headstrong young man whose thoughtless violence gets him in trouble and threatens his relationship with his fiancee Olenka Billevich. When war breaks out with Sweden he swears allegiance to Janusz Radziwill, the Hetman of Lithuania. What he doesn't know is that Radziwill has conspired to betray the Commonwealth to the Swedes.

Kmicic (or Kmita) goes along with Radziwill, thus earning the hatred and contempt of former comrades like Michael Wolodyjowski. Upon learning just how bad the Radziwills are, however, he changes sides in an attempt to redeem himself. Sienkiewicz has him play a central role in the siege of Czestochowa (Poland's Fort McHenry), and Sweden's failure to capture the fortress may in fact have been the turning point of the war. He also saves the King of Poland from an ambush and later plays a central role in winning a decisive battle.

As shown in the book, Sienkiewicz actually meant Kmita to symbolize the unruly Polish nobility while Olenka symbolized Poland itself. Of the three books in the Trilogy, ""The Deluge"" is probably the best because of the protagonist's character development throughout the story and the epic struggle to liberate Poland from the Swedes.

The film's color quality leaves something to be desired and in fact seems to become black-and-white when distant objects are involved. This is perhaps due to the fact that Poland was still under Soviet control and the quality of everything in the Eastern Bloc may have been second-rate. The story and the performances are nonetheless every bit as good if not better than any four-star epic from the black-and-white era and there are no problems with the soundtrack.",1143072000,15,1699,5.10431654676259

1758939,1,B00006HCFD,"Don't buy this DVD distributed by Polart. It looks as if someone setup a video camera and then videotaped the movie playing on a cheap TV.  You can actually see the TV scan lines in the picture. Plus the colors are washed out to a dull uniform gray, and the picture is literally crooked on the screen (their video camera wasn't pointed directly at the TV, but was off to the side somewhere).

If you can get a copy of the Polish release, you'll see this movie with the colors and picture intact. But you will not get subtitles. That's the only reason to buy this Polart release.

NOTE:  Polart recently remastered these DVDs.  I took a chance and purchased the new ones - they are greatly improved.  Still not the highest quality, but worth buying.",1092960000,32,748,4.463235294117647

1758941,4,B00006HCFD,"Hunky Polish actor Daniel Obrychski plays our hero Andrzej Kmicic in this saga of love, war, and treachery in 17th-century Poland. Kmicic falls in love with the lovely Olenka only to have a pre-Ikea Swedish invasion complicate matters for him. Kmicic unwisely chooses to ally himself with the dastardly Hetman Radziwill who promptly hands over the country to the Swedish King and his evil hordes of musketeers after the Hetman promises to keep Olenka safe. (Pay attention to the hats: it's the only way to keep track of the good guys and the bad guys in this complicated epic. The Swedes wear big floppy wide brimmed ones, the Poles demure feathered pillboxes or furry turbans). Accused of treachery by the loyal Poles, Kmicic is abandoned by his pals including Colonel Wolodyjowski (of the eponymous earlier-filmed sequal), who start a rebellion. Escaping death numerous times, Kmicic steals away (leaving Olenka in the hands of the dastardly fop Prince Boguslav Radziwill), changes his name, and saves the Monastery of Czestochowa with its Black Madonna from the giant Swedish siege gun. He then saves the good Polish king Jan Kazimir from the Swedes, convincing his old pals of his true loyalty to Poland. Defeating the armies of the Swedish King, Prince Boguslav, and English mercenaries in a massively staged battle (with the aid of the exotic Tatars of Aga Khan), Kmicic is near mortally wounded and sent home to die. Meanwhile Olenka has escaped from Boguslav's lair and, after Kmicic's umpteenth miraculous recovery, forgives Kmicic for his sins and  it's happy ever after for Poland and  its romantic heroes.
Anyway it's all grandly filmed to epic proportions with amazing costumes and battle scenes. The production values of this film are much higher than Hoffman's predecessor Pan Wolodyjowski, and the complicated story seems a little more rounded out. The filmmakers seem to have decided Daniel Obrychski needed a LOT of eye makeup to help him look tragic and soulful, but heck, it's art. It is of course a caricature in its comic-book patriotism, but a rewarding and entertaining one at that. The VHS print is adequate, though the subtitles are badly timed and sometimes atrociously spelled and occasionally completely indicipherable.
I saw this film for the first time in Poland in 1976 and it holds up well. Interesting little known history and cinematic spectacle.",989193600,8,2381,5.102564102564102

7968873,4,B00006HCFD,"Since others have summarized the strengths (amazing battle scenes, no cgi, eminently believable hand to hand combat, delicious dueling) and its troubles, (the makeup, the soulful Olenka soulfully staring, and the difficulty in keeping straight who's who for a non-Pole) let me just offer one tiny addition.

Prince Boguslaw Radziwill is one of the most amazing characters I have ever seen in film. I've not read the novel, though I bet they were being faithful, but the arrogance, self-centered conceit, and yet ferocious skill and bravery were wonderfully portrayed. So often when seeing costume dramas, the nobles seem too much like us, just with nicer clothes and houses. Boguslaw makes it clear in every slight action and tiny gesture that he has nothing in common with his inferiors. A larger than life villain, he is clearly who he is, for better or worse. The film improved hugely when he arrived.

The colors are a bit washed out, and the sound feels as if it were added later...very odd. I bet seeing this when new, with a vibrant print and roaring sound on a vast screen would have been an amazing experience. Watching it on my not-so-big screen was still a treat.

And you will see the finest collection of facial hair ever gathered on screen. Wow--these guys grew some astonishing whiskers!",1316131200,2,1302,4.882352941176471
7968874,4,B00006HCFD,"This is not as flashy and elaborate as ""With fire and sword"" by the same director, but given the period in which it was made, it is still a work of very good quality. The print unfortunately is not very good, probably because of the low-tech filming. However the story, dramatization, etc are wonderful. It is a long film but very engrossing indeed.",1290988800,2,349,4.555555555555555
