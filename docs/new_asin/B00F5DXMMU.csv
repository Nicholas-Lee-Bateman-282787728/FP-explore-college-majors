Then I got my hands on the book and got so much into READING - Yes, Reading from a book, something I have been neglecting for a while - that I wanted to see the movie again..... or should I say own it this time! The presentation and extra DVD/ Documentary  are a big plus. My only issue is the region/DVD - Is this sound like a broken record? I had to see it in my laptop which takes some of the scenic away from it but not enough to give 4 stars! :)",1470441600,,483,3.735294117647059
