8749913,4,B01BDQP7OS,"This television series from Republic Pictures is excellent and has many loved and familiar supporting actors. But there are problems with the DVD discs.  The picture sometimes freezes, or there is pixel separation. I have not been able to watch some titles because they will not play, or the player will skip over to the beginning of the nest title.  I have tried using another DVD player but the experience is the same with both. I returned the first copy I purchased and Amazon quickly sent me a new copy. But the problems continued with the new set. The series is good but the DVD product is defective, so I'd recommend waiting for another, better release if, or when, it becomes available.",1502668800,,693,4.672131147540983

8749917,5,B01BDQP7OS,"The Hollywood B or series western came to a sudden end in the early 1950s when kids abandoned the Saturday matinee to watch similar fare on Saturday morning TV.  Major western stars Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Hopalong Cassidy, The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid immediately jumped into television and were joined by Range Rider, Cowboy G-Men, Kit Carson, Jim Bowie, Annie Oakley and dozens of others.

Perhaps the best directed, best written and most exciting of all was STORIES OF THE CENTURY that ran for one 39-episode season in 1939, produced by Republic Pictures. Veteran William Witney, who directed the best Republic serials from 1937 on (The Lone Ranger, Captain Marvel, Spy Smasher) and the best Roy Rogers color westerns of the late 1940s, helmed the first 30 episodes of CENTURY. Witney was adept at staging non-stop fights and chases and seamlessly integrated them with the Republic stock library of stampedes, indian attacks and building explosions used as serial endings.

The hero is railroad detective Matt Clark, played by burly, no-nonsense Jim Davis. Each week Matt tangles with a famous western outlaw - Jesse James (Lee Van Cleef), Billy the Kid, Belle Starr (Marie Windsor) and Geronimo in just the first four episodes! After the whirlwind action involving Matt, the true demises of the bad guys are enacted taken from actual newspaper accounts of the times.

Matt Clark is ably assisted in each adventure by a woman detective who matches him in fist fights and gun play. Mary Castle, who somewhat resembles Rita Hayworth, plays Frankie in the first 26 episodes, and Kristine Miller plays Jonesy in 14. The ladies usually go undercover as a post mistress, piano player or shop girl, but just as quickly jump into the action. Off screen romancing with Matt is implied.

STORIES OF THE CENTURY is available complete for the first time in this box set of all 39 episodes put out by Nostalgia Family. Quality is excellent. Highly recommended.",1465084800,6,1956,4.969418960244648
8749918,5,B01BDQP7OS,Great series.  It's fun seeing the young Jim Davis.  Am very glad I purchased this DVD set.,1464566400,3,91,4.294117647058823
8749919,5,B01BDQP7OS,"This not the first release of Stories of the Century. The series has been in the public domain for many years and as such, several PD companies have put out compilations of various episodes,, mostly from battered & choppy old TV prints. To my knowlege though ,this is the first time all 39 episodes have been put out as a complete set..The episodes are spread over 5 discs, so not over compressed, on a single spindle in a standard sized amray case. There are no extras.

The series itself dates from the early 50's & was made by Hollywood Television Services which was the TV arm of Republic Studios, famous for all their 'B' westerns. It stars Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, an entirely fictional character tracking down just about every real life outlaw from the old west., some famous such as Billy the Kid, Jesse James & Black Bart , along with some lesser known characters. Curiously his undercover 'sidekick' for this series was a woman Frankie Adams ,played by Mary Castle. . Frankie was not the usual shrinking violet type of lead common in westerns of the period but actually involved herself in the action. She was replaced later in the series by another woman 'Jonesy' played by Kristine Miller.

Despite the historical inaccuracies the series is entertaing & enhanced by armloads of stock footage from Republic's library. Seasoned fans of old westerns will also spot many regular western players such as Lee Van Cleef & others in early roles.

However, the main reason for obtaining this set over others out there is the quality. Surprisingly someone has gone to the trouble & expense of remastering the prints & they are presented here in clean ,sharp quality, 100% better than anything released before",1458864000,14,1729,4.814814814814815
