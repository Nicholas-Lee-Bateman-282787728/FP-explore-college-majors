Jennifer Beals could have had more of a stronger role in this movie.  I do not know why the authors of this movie felt Jennifer's hair should have been short.  It makes her look younger than her original age.",1385683200,,345,4.166666666666667

7831289,5,6302765234,The acting was phenominal and the script superb.  A very interseting and sad end.  Geraint was convincing and sincere actor.  I highly recommend this video as a worthy addition to a video collection.,937958400,2,199,4.96969696969697
