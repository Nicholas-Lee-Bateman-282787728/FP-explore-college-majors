3904538,4,B002C7ELWC,"This was the best show ever!  I don't care how often I watch it, I still crack my side!  I think Tommy Davidson was funny as always.  I could have done without DeRay Davis...he wasn't funny at all to me and bordered on being a bit on having issues with women.  ARIES SPEARS WAS HILARIOUS!!!!  Can he do an impression...OMG!!! He was awesome, outstanding, off 'da chain!  His impression of Charles Barkley and Shaq doubles me over in laughter every time I see it.  And lets not leave out KEVIN HART---HE IS SO FUNNY, OMG!!  He kept us in stitches especially talking about his family at Chuck E. Cheese's and about double dating....too funny to miss!!!  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS and watched for it to come out on DVD.",1260489600,2,714,4.4728682170542635
3904539,5,B002C7ELWC,"This has to be one of Cedric the Entertainers' best since the Kings of Comedy. I laughed so hard that I went into a ashtma attack. Kevin Hart was undoubtedly the funniest, well him and Aries Spears are neck to neck. Those two brothers are hilarious, they are bound to send somebody to the hospital for laughing too hard and bursting something. Tommy Davidson did his thing, he really rocked it for the Latino crowd and Blacks and Whites alike. De'Ray had his dirty jokes but he was still funny as always. I really enjoyed this. This is a must for DVD collections especially for when friends come over or for a nice get together but don't take it to grandma! :)",1257724800,,660,4.418032786885246
3904540,4,B002C7ELWC,"I first seen this special on SHOWTIME back in july... and It has been saved in my DVR box every since!

This has to be one of the most funniest stand-up specials that I have seen in a loong while. The jokes are current and (sometimes) risky; The presentation is great (be sure to watch the end credits); and the comedians are at their best (Dee ray and Kevin Hart are the highlights for me).

I would say the only down side is the opening performance (Tommy disappoints), and the special is a little bit on the short side;
(or I just didn't want it to end... either or!). But other than that, I would say this dvd is a must buy for any stand-up fan. (Watch it with friends or family, makes it more fun)",1257552000,,702,4.154411764705882

3904542,3,B002C7ELWC,"Aries Spears and Kevin Hart were funny; really, just laugh out loud funny.  Tommy Davidson should seriously think about retirement or if not, he should learn how cater to the audience in front of him.  DeRay Davis.....for real?  Cedric, you need a new crew...",1255305600,,259,4.840909090909091

3904544,5,B002C7ELWC,"I caught this on showtime while channel surfing, and i'm really glad I did.  Everybody was extremely funny.  I don't usually like the comedy of Aries Spears, but I must say he was hilarious, i completely fell to the floor in laughter.  Tommy Davidson's skit is one you have to experience personally in order to relate to and that made him stand out more, he was too funny for words.  Shortly after the show had aired I immeadiatly searched the internet for a copy on dvd.  This is a must have for those who like to laugh, and i must have it...",1251849600,,543,4.284313725490196

I SEEN KEVIN HART ON THE 40YROLD VIRGIN, BUT I HAD NO IDEA HE WAS SO FUNNY. ARIES SPEARS OF COURSE IS ALWAYS FUNNY. IT WAS THE BUISNESS!

3904639,5,B002C7ELWC,"I didn't want this to end.  Each and every comic on here was hysterical.  I don't know how Shaq got them all to come together and bring their ""A"" game.  I joked with my husband that Shaq spent all the funds on his comedy show that yr because the following yr was terrible.  Cedric the Entertainer is always funny.  I was surprised that Tommy Davison had me laughing too because I've never thought he was too funny.  But then When DeRay and the guy from Mad TV came on, they blew it up.  DeRay is hysterical, he's the kind of comedian that is in your family and has everyone laughing at the cookouts.  Dude from Mad TV (sorry, can't remember his name) had a mix of improv, comedy, and impersonation.  He's always funny because he can do so many different things.  Then KEVIN HART!!!!  When he came out and joked on Shaq and Shaunie, some guy in the audience that was way too ridiculous.  Kevin is the funniest comedian out right now.  He's an observational comedian and talks about his life and other things that are extremely relatable.  I could watch this every day.  I was literally in tears laughing so hard.",1313884800,,1111,4.430693069306931

3904641,5,B002C7ELWC,"Well, the humour and jokes performed by these five comedians are simply in a class of its own. There doesn't seem to be any school to learn from these comedians because they do it so naturally. Being from the UK, I find it unbelieveable to find how I can co-relate to what they were saying. They are not alone, because equally they are just a small section of American comedians, from a vast amount of even greater ones since past,  that can tell humour in a way that leaves you gasping for air. I'm glad I bought this DVD",1301616000,,522,4.2727272727272725
3904642,4,B002C7ELWC,Great stand-up...Aries Spears was hilarious and nailed all of his impersonations. Kevin Hart is his usual crazy self. But DeRay stole the show. He is a very underrated comedian and I have seen other stand-up shows from this kat and he is just wack. He should have more spotlight. What's the deal?!,1298246400,,297,4.730769230769231
3904643,5,B002C7ELWC,"You will enjoy this one.  Some were funnier than others but Kevin Hart was funny, funny, funny.  This was a gift for a friend and they loved it!",1292457600,,144,4.107142857142857
3904644,4,B002C7ELWC,I bought this DVD after seeing a clip online.  Kevin Hart and DeRay Davis stole the show!  I didn't feel that Aries Spears or Tommy Davidson used any new material.  Aries ALWAYS does the same impersonations. Cedric The Entertainer did a good job as host.,1291766400,,254,4.6
3904645,5,B002C7ELWC,"One word""""HILARIOUS"". You will love this dvd. Cedric and Tommy Davidson rocked it. and the young gun Deray Davis is a talent to be reckoned with. He is definitely holding his own in the world of comedy. Aries Spears gets it done with his impressions of Snoop, DMX, LL Cool J, Jay-Z and Denzel Washington. Get this DVD.",1284768000,,318,4.5
3904646,5,B002C7ELWC,"OMG! This is such a good dvd. All of the comedians were great. I laughed during the entire time viewing it. My husband and I took it over to some friends house over the Labor Day weekend and it was a hit. Of course, you should know that this is not clean comdey. It's funny but not something that you can view with your children that are not grown (18 or above). This is definitely grown folks comedy. If you're ready for gut busting laughter, this is for you.",1283817600,,460,4.179775280898877
3904647,2,B002C7ELWC,"Not much I can really say, but I will say that Aries Spears was the only truly funny person on the DVD. I always thought he was pretty good on MadTV and I had no doubt he would deliver a good set. Additionally, I was also a bit surprised to hear what he referred to the women in the audience as....

In terms of the other comedians it was pretty much the same formula. Which is pretty much: Ensure every other word that comes out of your mouth is a cuss word, jump around a lot, and lastly, make sure you tell nothing but grating and stupid ""yall know that's right!!"" -esque jokes.

It's been awhile since I sat and watched this type of comedy and now I know why. The material is to limited and delivery of the jokes is simply just to overdone and similiar to evoke any laughter from the viewer for more than 15 minutes.",1282435200,,820,4.150943396226415
3904648,3,B002C7ELWC,"I gave it a 3 because 3 of the 5 comics were funny.  Cedric is always funny, I didn't even know Tommy Davidson was so funny, and of course Kevin Hart was ridiculous!!!  The other two? No.  They BOTH called women in the audience ""b*tch"" and I find no humor in that at all.  Aries Spears called a woman in the audience a b*tch at the very beginning of his act! Deray finds being offensive funny.  His act wasn't funny at all.  Glad 3 of the 5 were funny, otherwise I'd be upset I bought this.",1280793600,,490,4.052083333333333

3904650,5,B002C7ELWC,I died laughing at this and so needed to laugh because I woke up irritated and upset. Just kept me laughing the whole time. This is worth your money. BUY IT!,1276041600,7,157,4.096774193548387

3904652,5,B002C7ELWC,I was introduced to this dvd courtesy of Youtube and a 2-minute clip of Arie Spears.  I immediately placed my order for a copy of this comedy show and can't say enough about it.  Cedric the Entertainer is brilliant .... Arie Spears is a star who needs to continue to rise because his combination of comedy/improv/impersonation is 100% on point .... and DeRay Davis is a force to be wreckoned with in the comedy world.  I was surprised that Tommy Davidson wasn't as funny as he has been in his previous standup concerts...but he warmed up the crowd.  Kevin Hart is hysterical.  This dvd is well worth every penny (and then some); it's something that for me will never get old!,1267747200,9,675,4.545454545454546
3904653,5,B002C7ELWC,"My wife and I busted our guts when we first saw it on cable.  We had to buy it and once it arrived we had to watch it all over again.  If you want a good laugh, you will want this DVD.  Each comics style and delivery was great.",1265673600,3,227,3.5918367346938775
