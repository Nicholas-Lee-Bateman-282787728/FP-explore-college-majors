8507301,5,B006ZV6Y8A,"It's evident to anyone who has heard his work that contemporary composer Salvatore Sciarrino's music doesn't use instruments in any conventional fashion. Wind instruments whine and explode in whooshes of puffed air, strings are plucked, scraped, hammered and stretched.  Voices stutter out rapid phrases, flowing and swirling the words, sometimes blending with other voices, other times locked in a repetitive cycle that struggles to break through the looming silence. That works powerfully for a certain kind of work that has a sinister edge to it, and that's the dominant mood in the chamber opera Luci Mei Traditrici ('My Betraying Eyes' but also known in English as 'The Killing Flower'), a work based on a 17th century text that describes the troubadour Gesualdo's jealous murder of his wife and her lover. The music and vocal delivery on their own make a tremendous impression, but just how effective Sciarrino's opera writing is can only really be felt when it is staged.

This performance recorded at the Cantiere Internazionale d'Arte di Montepulciano in Tuscany in 2010 is then a rare opportunity to see Sciarrino's strengths as a musical dramatist. The composer draws on two ancient references for the music and the libretto, but the musical idiom is distinctly modern, the spare arrangements scattered with sounds, noises and flurries of melodies that express the lyrical violence of the subject. Reflecting the music and the drama, Alexander Lintl's stage design is similarly spare but movements can be somewhat more elaborate, like a ritualistic dance, the holding of fans suggesting a Flamenco or even a tango that carries a presentiment of violence. Under Christian Pade's direction it becomes practically an abstract visual representation of the music itself, as intensely intricate a combination of words, music, drama and staging as you could imagine, where every single note counts, where every gesture and movement is precisely calculated.

The performance of this highly specialised and difficult language is similarly astonishing, the contemporary musicians of the Ensemble Algoritmo conducted with precision of detail by Marco Angius. Like the production team, most of the singers seem to be Frankfurt Opera regulars, with soprano Nina Tarandek and baritone Christian Miedl extraordinarily good as the Duke and Duchess, their spoken voice repetitive rhythms interweaving and clashing in a way that defines the relationship between them. If the music and noises behind them can be unsettling, the singing voices are hypnotically lyrical and Roland Schneider's countertenor soars as the 'guest' who comes between them. Simon Bode sings the role of the servant, who has a small but vital role in the drama.

The DVD recording isn't quite of the High Defintion standard that you would find in most large-budget recordings of opera on Blu-ray, but it effectively captures the mood and setting of the performance. The image is strongly contrasted and in NTSC format, it lacks fine detail, but the filming of the performance is superb. The audio track - PCM Stereo only - is outstanding. The DVD includes a half-hour feature on the production, with the composer himself giving a walk-though of the work, explaining its structure and use of sounds. The very specific intentions of how it should be performed and the attention to detail can be seen in the rehearsals for the performance. The DVD is region-free, with subtitles in Italian, English, German, French and Japanese.",1413763200,3,3491,5.284684684684684
8507302,3,B006ZV6Y8A,"The Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino is both steeped in tradition and deeply avant-garde at the same time. Inspired by the classical canon, he nonetheless transforms that inheritance through extended techniques: strings play ghostly harmonics, wind performers overblow notes or produce multiphonics. Take, for example, his ""Sei Capricci"" for violin (1976, best heard on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coviello-disc/dp/B000GLKKT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coviello disc</a>) where what looks like conventional Paganini-like writing in the score sounds when performed as sparkling, ethereal sounds.

His 1998 opera ""Luci mie traditrici"" (My Treacherous Eyes, sometimes retitled ""Killing Flower"") applies that style to vocal writing with remarkable effect. The simple plot is inspired by the story of Gesualdo, the Renaissance composer who discovered that his wife was cheating on him, and then murdered her and her lover in bed, his aristocratic rank protecting him from prosecution. Hearing that Alfred Schnittke was preparing an opera on the same theme, Sciarrino deleted overt references to Gesualdo (and quotations of Gesualdo's music), and he chose to adapt 17th-century playwright Giacinto Andrea Cicognini's own retelling of Gesualdo under the title ""Il tradimento per l'onore"".

As the opera opens, a Dutchess (soprano, here Nina Tarandek) and Duke (baritone, Christian Miedl) pledge eternal love to each other. Soon, however, the Dutchess is seduced by a Guest (counter-tenor, Roland Schneider), and the tryst is reported to the Duke by a Servant (tenor, Simon Bode). Thus ends the first act. In the second, the Duke prepares the murder of the Guest and then his wife, at which this hour-long staging comes to a sudden end.

The vocal writing is eerie, lines thrown out scattershot, long-held notes at the beginning collapsing into a series of grace notes. The ensemble of 22 players (winds, strings and bass drum) produces Sciarrino's characteristic soundworld of skittering, noctural sounds. While avant-garde, the musical accompaniment is not noisy or abstract, instead it seems to depict the unspoken thoughts of the characters. As a prologue to the opera, we hear a snippet of pure Renaissance-era music, and later in the opera this same material is heard transformed through Sciarrino's extended techniques. The action is stylized, with for example the Dutchess and Guest's tryst expressed only through repetition of suggestive lines and pregnant pauses. The austere and ritualistic proceedings remind this viewer of drama from some non-Western culture, such as kabuki.

In this DVD, Marco Angius leads the Ensemble Algoritmo in a July 2010 production. How does this stack up against other recordings? This seems to be the same performance as captured on a 2011&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stradivarius-disc/dp/B0050JPFMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stradivarius disc</a>. There is an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/earlier-Stradivarius-disc/dp/B00013D4OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">earlier Stradivarius disc</a>&nbsp;where the Ensemble Risognanze performs, but I have not heard that yet. I am familiar with the Klangforum Wien/Beat Furrer performance&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/on-Kairos/dp/B00005JSJH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">on Kairos</a>, and that is somewhat superior in terms of sound (the ensemble being more prominent in the mix). However, the Algoritmo/Angius production is deftly performed and Sciarrino himself calls it definitive.

While its nice to have at least some visuals, I am not entirely happy with this DVD. It's bad enough that this was released solely in DVD instead of Blu-ray, but even the DVD transfer is flawed: with artifacts visible in near every shot. Was this shot for television broadcast and then re-encoded for DVD? The DVD does come with a bonus where the singers, Angius and the Ensemble Algoritmo rehearsing the piece and discuss how they approach Scarrino's music.

So while I would consider ""Luci mie traditrici"" a four-star affair (impressive, though not among the greatest operas I've ever seen), that poor quality of the visuals leads me to dock a star. I'm sorry I have to do that, since I suppose we should be grateful we get a video of this avant-garde opera at all.",1407801600,2,4413,6.109677419354838
8507303,5,B006ZV6Y8A,Salvatore Sciarrino is great composer of our time. His opera is wonderful. The stage is very good and the singers are very professional.,1361059200,,136,4.956521739130435
8507304,5,B006ZV6Y8A,"... and in fact I'm absolutely certain that many of ""you"" will hate it and never finish watching it. Take my ""five star"" rating with caution therefore. My own initial reaction to the bizarre vocal writing of Salvatore Sciarrino was closer to horror than appreciation. Only my ""pride"" in being au courant compelled me to listen again and to keep listening, listening, listening ... until I could hear what it is that other auditors relish in Sciarrino's abrasive distortions of language ad melody. Do I love it now? Not quite, but I think I ""get it"" well enough to admire its originality.

""Luci Mie Traditori"" is a four-character chamber opera of seventy minutes. It's a lurid tale of infidelity and jealousy, based abstractly on the murder of his wife and her lover by the 17th C Italian composer Don Carlo Gesualdo, whose extreme chromaticisms and emotive dissonances have made him more famous in our times than he was in his own. If you know Gesualdo's madrigals, you may be able to hear allusions to them in the score of Sciarrino's opera.

Everything about Sciarrino's music is provocatively edgy and avant garde. He means his sounds to be as shocking as the passions his libretto portrays. His vocal lines are essentially ""recitativo"" shattered with irruptions of sound and silence, but the words of his recitativos flicker so quickly past our ears that no subtitles could possibly catch up to them. I could follow the Italian only with such intense concentration that I scarcely heard the music. It's a texture of outbursts. And it must have required the singers -- the Countess/Wife Nina Tarandek, the Cuckolded Count Christian Miedl, and the Lover/Guest Roland Schneider -- to forego all normal habits of vocal technique. I'm often astounded by the ability of singers to memorize bizarre and difficult modernist roles, but this performance challenges credibility.

Sciarrino is ""hot"" these days. If you live in Europe, you'll get your chance to hear his music in your local concert hall or opera house soon enough. I don't know of any current or approaching productions in the USA. What more can I say? Give it a whirl; it might be the future you'll be hearing.",1354060800,4,2170,4.891304347826087
