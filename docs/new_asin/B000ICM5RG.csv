2655502,3,B000ICM5RG,"I love these vintage Disney shows, but I have to say I'm very disappointed with this addition to the Treasures Series. I have collected the entire Treasures series and the 10th anniversary episode has already been included on the Disneyland U.S.A set. But the show was edited on the previous Treasures DVD, five minutes of Tiki Room footage was cut, so I hoped that Disney including it again on this volume would make up for the edit by providing an uncut version here. But No, it's Disney of course they didn't it's the same old version that was included last time edits and all. I mean there are so many wonderful episodes of the show that could have been included here like the World's Fair episode, so why repeat previous material?",1167523200,57,735,4.6183206106870225
2655503,5,B000ICM5RG,"For most of you that weren't old enough to attend the NY World's Fair, note that It's a Small, Small World was originally built by Disney for the Fair to celebrate the UN world for children. It was later moved to Disney Land and kept the catchy theme song. Other things, including the Speaking Lincoln  were also part of the fair and then returned to Disney. It isn't an ""exciting"" ride, but it carries a lot of memories of what it was built to represent and is worth the ride to understand how Disney viewed the subject of children around the world. I attended the opening of Disney Land (and DisneyWorld) and am going back in March to see the new expansion and will probably be at DisneyLand for the 12th time sometime in the year. I have a complete collection of EVERY Disney cartoon that has been released and will CERTAINLY ADD THIS TO MY COLLECTION.",1167004800,3,855,4.445859872611465
2655504,5,B000ICM5RG,"I went to Costco, a 40 minute drive from where I live, to buy a Cuisinart for my wife (before you set in judgment, she ASKED for one!) for Christmas and 'lo and behold, what did they have, but the latest wave of Disney Treasures DVDs.

While I've been disappointed by several recent entries which as far as I'm concerned should, like ""the Scottish Play,"" NEVER be mentioned...THIS latest bunch is worthy of the name.

Particularly, ""Your Host, Walt Disney"" which reveals the man as consummate showman and an actor who can hold his own.  The tin is worth the 20-odd dollars for ONLY the fantastic, if all too brief, interview Leonard Maltin conducts with Diane Disney-Miller.  Add to bonus features such as ""I Captured The King of the Leprechauns"" and this tin elevates itself among the best in the series.

Last tidbit worthy of note it's been widely regarded that the last known recording of Walt as Mickey were the Mickey Mouse Club intros in 1955 (Soundman, Jimmy McDonald, took over the role in 1947).  No longer true!  In an outstanding re-creation of a Cinemascope/Live Action presentation featuring a filmed Walt and a live action/stage performed Mickey in 1962, clearly the voice of Mickey Mouse is an aging, cigarette plagued Walt!

Five stars!!",1166832000,8,1254,4.827102803738318
2655505,3,B000ICM5RG,"I bought the Disneyland USA treasures set specifically for the Disneyland 10th anniversary show, and in particular for the tiki room segment. I was appalled and very angry to find that they had done their creative editing again. About 8 minutes were cut out of the tiki room segment, and then to add insult to injury they put a large hard to avoid flashing warning on the bottom of the screen during the tahitian terrace fire dance segment. All this from a set that was pretty heavily advertised as being ""uncut"" and ""original"". The other shows on the set had some light editing done as well, whenever the mousketeers normally showed up breifly in the background these peices were cut out, and of course the infamous scene in the opening day broadcast where Walt thinks he's off camera and swears a bit. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of revisionist history. I would rather take these things as whole and unedited blemishes and all, then have someone take out parts for one reason or another.

I am really really hoping that the reason that the 10th anniversary show is on this set yet again, is that they are putting out a unedited original version. If not, then once again as with many disney things lately I will have to find a way to put my old unedited television tapings from disney channel onto dvd. I refuse to buy into someone else's version of history, and will not buy edited dvd's. For it to be a ""treasure"" it has to be an original version to me, otherwise its pretty near useless garbage in a pretty decorated tin.",1159660800,202,1551,4.519572953736655
2655506,4,B000ICM5RG,"Disney DVD has announced 6 episodes that will be included in this collection:

1) ""The Fourth Anniversary Show"" : 1957 DISNEYLAND season opener, originally aired 9/11/57 on ABC.

2) ""Where Do Stories Come from?"" (1956) a nice little behind-the-scenes show about the Disney animators and their inspiration.

3) ""I Captured The King of the Leprechauns"" : this last DISNEYLAND episode of the 1958 season was a big promo for the Darby O'Gill movie, originally aired 5/29/59 on ABC.  *** This has already been released as a bonus on the Darby O'Gill DVD. ***

4) ""Kodak Presents Disneyland '59"" : a long thought lost TV special, not part of the DISNEYLAND series. This is well worth getting this set for!

5) ""Back Stage Party"" sort of a behind-the-scenes wrap party for Disney's 1961 movie ""Babes In Toyland"" starring Annette.

6) ""Disneyland 10th Anniversary Show"" : from the 1964 season of Wonderful World Of Color, originally aired 1/3/65 on NBC. *** Sadly, this EDITED presentation is identical to the show's previous appearance on the Disneyland USA Treasures tin, missing several minutes of Tiki Room footage. ***  Sure that older DVD is out of print, but It is disappointing not to have a new to DVD episode included here, or a complete version correcting the previous error.  There are SO many episodes in which Walt plays a major part, this DOUBLE DIPPING is regrettable! ***",1158537600,143,1380,4.913793103448276
2655517,4,B000ICM5RG,"As others have said, the ""new"" material on this set is well worth having, while the other stuff if fun if you didn't already have the sets on which they appeared before (10th anniversary, leprechauns).
The main reason I'm leaving a review is this: the price is ludicrous. $140 for this set? They're still selling it at retail at the gift shop at the Walt Disney Family Museum, where I picked it up. Yes, the numbered tin case, not some weird reprint.

I was hoping to find some old Wonderful World of Disney movies, like what came on TV on Sunday nights.  Instead, this is a background of some things he was interested in, like trains, showing scenes of him having a train set built on his land that would accommodate people.

As I explained in the letter, that title was misleading because the charater, Goofy, showed up only as a man with a Goofy head for about three seconds.  Nowhere in the discs did any portion of ""Goofy's Cavalcade of Sports"" run.

Thank you for your quick response.  I am sure I will continue to be a valued customer.

2655523,5,B000ICM5RG,great dvd. enjoyed everything on it. It was great to see so much history that many don't know about with Disney,1379116800,,111,4.333333333333333
2655524,4,B000ICM5RG,"The third release of Wave 6 Your Host Walt Disney is a very good set for the Disneyland show and Park enthusiast. After watching so many cartoon shorts on these sets, it's a welcome change to see another treasures set devoted to some of the live action shows and these programs about Disneyland. I love this stuff and there are some truly rare programs here.

The first disc contains 3 programs from the classic TV show and some interesting extras. One of them is an interview with Walt's daughter Diane and the others are three galleries which show Walt at work on his many projects and stills from early Disneyland. The episodes here all look very good, but to be honest they are cartoon heavy and after watching so many of them in color to see the same cartoons in black and white is a little boring.

The real gems here are the complete and restored Peter and the Wolf cartoon in the 4th anniversary episode and Disneyland 59' which was thought to be lost. It's a great nostalgia piece, but most of it is boring. Watching parade footage from 1959 is pretty ho hum to me, but I wouldn't say it isn't a welcome addition to this set. It's great to have and there are many good moments throughout. I also loved the section with Walt working on his miniature railroad.

The second disc is a little disappointing because one of the main features is a repeat from Disneyland U.S.A. It is the 10th anniversary show, this is a great episode, but for collectors of the entire series, we are looking for unreleased episodes, not episodes we already have. Unfortunately it is edited like the previous release? The addition of the repeat would have been excused, if they had added the missing footage this time around. There is also the inclusion of 'I Captured the King of the Leprechauns, which is fine, if you don't own Darby O'Gill and the Little People. There are two main features(one a repeat) and three very good bonus features(one has been released before),

This is a worthy treasures set, but it does have some disappointments. I still recommend it like all of the others so far. It's Disney when it was still Walt Disney!",1378339200,,2124,4.566929133858268
2655525,5,B000ICM5RG,If you like Walt Disney at all you will just love this set of DVD's. there is a 1950 Christmas special and a lot of behind the camera on how he made some of the magic,1376784000,,166,3.638888888888889

2655531,1,B000ICM5RG,So I am completely disappointed.  Talked about remembering a show my sister and I watched when we were you and have been searching...For the Love of Wilameana.  We finally found it or at least I thought we did when it was listed in the description on Amazon for this disc only now I get it an its all documentary stuff.  Even more confusing is that the back of the box says the total run time is 7 hours 38 minutes yet I have 2 discs in the box...one 3 hours and 13 minutes and the other 1 hour and 38 minutes...So according to my math thats about 2 hours and 47 minutes short.  Im guessing that time is the 3 episodes of the show that are SUPPOSED to be in the box but are not.  Brilliant!,1299715200,6,690,4.044117647058823

2655533,2,B000ICM5RG,"Well once again the Disney people are more worried about correctness than presenting history in film in its original form.  You may call it polite, I call it cowardice and censorship.  The few do not need to decide for the many how to judge the past - this elitist attitude on the part of publishers and editors needs to be put to a dismal end.  C'mon Disney, get a grip, have some gonads and present history in film as it is/was - uncut, unedited, uncensored and take the REST of your stuff off the dusty shelves and get them out for all to see - this is how the world was presented ""back in the day"" - and viewers can judge for themselves what is acceptable and what is not.

Even the commercials give you a ""gosh, I remember when..."" feeling, and these shows are really, really fun. Not the least of the pleasures is the restoration (by inserting the original film footage where available instead of relying merely on kinescopes of the broadcast versions) which is quality through and through.

We forget today that while he'd been a very successful producer and mogul, Walt Disney was NOT personally a 'celebrity' until he began hosting his series on the then-new TV medium, and the way his public personality was crafted by himself and his writers/directors is interesting to watch, too.  Beyond this, the history of not just the DIsney films, shows, cartoons and theme parks but of television itself is on display here, including how Disney recycled their old cartoons into this new medium with positive effect. Its also a study in a way of PR and publicity since every episode of the SHOW ""Disneyland"" was really a commercial for the theme park.

Spread out over two discs are lots of amazing bits and pieces, the best of which involves Walt and the Mouseketeers enjoying an 'impromptu' anniversary party where the kids put on a show (""The Rainbow Road To Oz"") and get a promise from Mr. Disney that he will cast them in the movie (instead, he cancelled their daily show!). A black-and-white kinescope broadcast of a Disneyland parade in 1959 brings out lots of stars and parade-hoopla, but if you just want to see Annette dance--skip ahead to the Matterhorn celebration (and check out that amazing ice-skater!). A color presentation of the entire ""Peter and the Wolf"" short is included, as well as Walt himself acting alongside Darby O'Gill and the Little People (which begs the question, why did Disney unveil so much of his current product for free on television?

Walt is Uncle Walt, sharing his special studio with you. It is akin to Willie Wonka taking us into hios chocolate factory. Great Disney memories. I only wish there were more episodes on this two volume set showcasing Walt being Walt--maybe there is hope for a volume two

Many of the Disneyland TV shows include the animated 'shorts' in their intirety, making you wish they would end and walt would come back on the screen.

Overall, an excellent product you will cherish for ages.",1169424000,2,482,4.746987951807229
2655557,5,B000ICM5RG,"I remember waiting each Sunday night to watch Disney on my mom's Color TV!  When I heard this DVD was coming out, I wanted to buy it. The two disk sets is wonderful but I will say that the 10th anniversary party is a repeat from the other treasures DVD Disneyland USA.  But the Disneyland 59 section is worth the price alone.  The 90 min special was a treat to watch.  I had never seen it before.  Some points were boring but the end of the parade is worth it all.  Another section that seemed to repeat was the Babes in Toyland wrap party.  I had seen that before.  The interviews with Disney's daughter were nice to see but to be honest, the best thing of the entire DVD was seeing Tommy Kirk again!  He is on disk two and can be seen a few times in the ""Working for Walt"" bonus section.  I loved Tommy in all the Disney movies while growning up and thought it was tragic the way Disney treated him in the end.  I did not think Tommy would want to do anything for Disney after that but he was there on this disk and was a great surprise for me to see him again.  Way to go Tommy!

This is the 4th of the Treasures collections I have gotten and it is well worth the money if you are a Walt fan.",1168646400,5,1195,3.9915611814345993
2655558,4,B000ICM5RG,"Before I bought the product I read a review being too critical of the editing of the pieces and so forth. To be honest, I remember growing up watching uncle Walt on the TV and not the specifics on the edited segments. So, if it lacks the technical realism of the original airings, it doesn't bother me much. It is very rich in the emotional (good nostalgia) sense and therefore I loved it. It brought back that sense of growing up in a simpler and nicer world. A world where the youth still spoke ""english"" and respected their elders, a world where entertainment didn't include morbid, violent games played through hand-held electronic devices. The world of Disney, the place that we all wanted to be in as kids. My only wish would be for the Disney Company to release all of the original ""Disneyland"" shows on DVD so that we wouldn't have to wait so long between the ""Treasures"" boxes to come out. This is the sort of stuff that you want to show your kids. It teaches them that people can be creative and inventive outside the world of computers and video games. The best of it is that it is entertaining for the whole family, unlike many of today's kiddie shows which appeal only to a particular age group (if you are a parent and had to sit through an episode of Barney with your kid you know exactly what I mean).",1168300800,10,1317,4.401639344262295
2655559,4,B000ICM5RG,"It's hard not to give a Disney Treasures release five stars, but I just couldn't do it with this one. Yes, Walt Disney makes a wonderful show host. Yes, he's nice, friendly and cordial with the audience and his guests. Yes, there are a few cartoons within the show (""Peter & The Wolf"" being the best). Yesyesyesyesyes on other arguments.....but by the 2nd disc the shows get tiresome as you watch backstage parties, singing and dancing Mousketeers and repetitive Disneyland behind-the-scenes info.

The set would've gotten five stars from me if it only contained Disc One, as it's three shows are fast-moving with many, many facets to them (even though the 90-minute episode seems to drag on as we have to sit thru an entire Disneyland parade).

The highlights of Disc 2 are the brief appearances of Guy Williams as Disney's newest addition, Zorro and Fess Parker without his Davy Crockett getup. Also the best bonus on Disc two are interviews with a few of the Grownup Mouseketeers: Tommy Cole, Don Grady (who still looks like he did on ""My Three Sons!"") and the GORGEOUS Cheryl Holdridge, who looks even MORE beautiful now than she did as a teenager! There are also interviews with Disney regular Tim Considine and singer Tommy Sands.

A couple of other bonuses saved Disc 2 from totally boring me: ""My Dad, Walt Disney"" which is an interview with Walt's daughter, Diane and the Disneyland episode titled ""I Captured the King of the Leprechauns"" that has clips of his film ""Darby O'Gill & The Little People"" (including the eerie Banshee and Death Coach scene!).

I still recommend this set for all fans of Disney and I have one last question: WHAT'S WITH TOMMY SANDS' BIZARRE HAIRSTYLE? Check it out when you buy this collection.....looks like a drunk muskrat sat on his head.",1168128000,11,1778,4.800653594771242
