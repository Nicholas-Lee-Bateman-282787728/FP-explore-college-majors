4154084,5,B003LUCW7A,The title of this documentary does not give it justice.  This is truly a biography of the Civil Rights Movement versus the prominent artists that are listed in bold on the cover.  I learned even more about the movement in this video versus other documentaries I have viewed.  Excellent and Highly Recommended.  Wish it had more LIKES.,1326672000,4,334,4.807017543859649
4154085,5,B003LUCW7A,An entertaining and informative watch for sure. Comes recommended for all amateur historians and music enthusiasts. Even more surprises than the cover indicates.,1314921600,,161,6.043478260869565
4154086,5,B003LUCW7A,"Although you are able to watch the music performances separately on the DVD, I wish there was a soundtrack CD available. I heard they are working on it. Anyway, there is some amazing footage on this DVD, historically accurate, great interviews, and the music definitely sets the tone - many arrangements done for this documentary specifically (not available for purchase anywhere else). Well done!",1307836800,2,397,5.21875

4154088,5,B003LUCW7A,"I just watched ""Soundtrack for a Revolution""; what a powerful documentary!!  This is a must see not only for Black people but ALL people!!  It is hard to believe that once upon a time in America, we were treated so cruely, for so long, but we have come a long, long, way from the racist Jim Crow systems across the south, particularly Alabama and Mississippi.  No racism hasn't gone away, it is more cleverly disguised and not as blatant these days but defintely not dead!!  This documentary will enlighten and liberate you!",1305676800,7,524,4.663043478260869
4154089,5,B003LUCW7A,"As someone that participated and filmed sit-ins, demonstrations and marches in the Northwest and also travelled through the south on two occasions to observe how civil rights issues were being handled during this late '60s and early '70s period I was particularly surprised with the accuracy and research in this documentary. For example, two sub-stories that are not well known that indicate to me me how well researched this doc is was the role that music played in providing both inspiration and motivation to many rights participants and the little know role that whites from the Northeast who travelled south, particularly from universities such as Columbia University provided as a supportive cast to this dramatic change in human consciousness. Of course, the interviews with Dr. King's supporters, musical performances and the historical film from that period provide the substance of ""Soundtrack for a Revolution"". To this add the editing and directing to select and meld all the interviews, film and music together and the result is an exemplary production.",1289952000,27,1067,5.319526627218935

4154097,1,B003LUCW7A,Most of the singers sang the wrong melody to these very powerful revolutionary songs. The production was poorly done. John Legend was powerful and awesome. I should have been the only singer on the program,1425340800,,205,4.885714285714286

4154104,3,B003LUCW7A,"My daughter had to watch this for a class, and was out for that day so I bought it for her.  Some of these folks are fine musicans but poseurs with respect to anything revolutionary. suffering little inconvenience in their quest for money and fame.  ON the other hand, anything with the Blind Boys of Alabama and Richie Havens in it has to rate at least three stars.  I've sat to speak with Richie Havens twice, and he will be missed, but his message and music live.",1392163200,2,466,4.333333333333333
4154105,5,B003LUCW7A,Just an amazing documentary! Critical piece of history. I watched with my teenage daughter and it inspires her to learn more about the freedom fighters and the children's crusade,1391558400,,178,5.172413793103448
4154106,5,B003LUCW7A,"I am a special education teacher and I show this every year for Black History Month. The students who are unable to read and write love the music and enjoy hearing the songs. For my other students, it really shows the timeline and how many people were involved in the civil rights movement. I recently introduced this movie to my parents, and they loved it, and were surprised at how well they lay out the movement with the interviews, music and film from the era. Amazing movie!",1391126400,,479,4.517241379310345
4154107,5,B003LUCW7A,I think this should be shown to all children in senior schools across Australia.  Many people don't realise the dreadful time it was for America at that time.  The music is fabulous.  I love it and I thank you for getting it to me before Christmas.  It will be a gift that I know the recipient will love.,1387670400,,304,4.189655172413793
4154108,4,B003LUCW7A,"I thought this was probably the best civil rights movie we watched, and i esp loved the historical clips, and when they would show a clip of someone in the past and then be interviewing that same person in the present.  Unfortunately, my kids found it boring - I homeschool a 10 and a 17 yo.",1387238400,,291,4.196428571428571

4154114,5,B003LUCW7A,"The DVD is marvelous. The director and his team integrate the music, interviews, and historic clips into a inspiring and hopeful film. I happened to watch this during the election. It reminded me of the remarkable bravery and dedication of the people who fought voter suppression 50 years and exposed the ugliness of Carl Rove's strategy to elect President Romney in 2012. Luckily for freedom, it failed and inspired people to stand in line for five hours or more just to exercise their right to vote.",1353369600,,501,4.837209302325581
4154115,3,B003LUCW7A,"As inspiring and important as the 1960s civil rights movement was, many wonder what else can possibly be taught about that era. With ""Soundtrack for A Revolution"" that curiosity is fathomed. The documentary takes on a familiar approach to teaching about the civil rights movement and the infamous events that lead us to where we stand today but there was a unique artistic flair that separated ""Soundtrack"" from a History Channel special.
 To this day, music is still arguably the most inspiring form of art and expression there is. ""Soundtrack"" vividly expresses the motivation that erupted from civil rights leaders and fellow protestors through music they all knew by heart and even lyrics made up on the spot to a familiar tune. The documentary almost works as a feature film version of Lionel Richie's ""We Are The World"" where famous musicians and movie stars all come together and sing about a common belief. ""Soundtrack"" is enriched by modern day artists black and white singing the songs that African Americans sang as they marched for their rights.
 ""Soundtrack"" avoids the stale and boring interview sessions used in news specials where we hear every question and watch the emotions of the interviewees as they crank out an answer. Instead, it's as if each interviewee is telling their own personal story about the events they participated in and the emotions come natural through reliving the memories. As short and sweet as the documentary was, it instilled just enough historical information, which coincided perfectly with the interviews and musical performances by the choir and musicians.
 Given the era that we are in now where everything is 180 degrees away from where it was fifty years ago, this film was produced at the perfect time. The president holding office is half African American and regardless of political beliefs, the idea that African Americans were once hosed by fireman and beaten to death for being who they are and now an African American holds the most powerful job on Earth says a lot. And the driving force of motivation to get there was simply music. The 60s were revolutionary for rock n' roll but not as much as soul and gospel were as the soundtrack for the African American race and this perfectly titled documentary proves it.",1335571200,3,2272,4.958005249343832
4154116,4,B003LUCW7A,"Soundtrack for a Revolution has an undeniable power and inspiration behind it. This film reminds us of how close our generation is to the civil rights movement. It illustrates how we are directly inherent of the sacrifices made by those activists fighting for peace and equality. Through the power of song, this movement was able to garner the attention it needed to create the change that it did. Those songs still live with us today. While the integration of contemporary musicians in this film was slightly off-putting, it is important to note how far we have come since the days of segregation. Our society now not only celebrates equality but has elected an African-American president.
The songs in Soundtrack for a Revolution are very short and repetitive. At times, they remind me of advertisement jingles, which are usually easy to remember and quite catchy. Each song had a phrase in it that was universal and relatable. I think that's what makes this movement unique. The songs attached to it kept everyone inspired and motivated. Even though the Civil Rights Movement had the singular goal to remove the segregation between blacks and whites, it became an anthem of equality for all. The Civil Rights Movement included a variety of people from all different walks of life. The powerful lyrics of ""We Shall Overcome"" relates to all movements, such as the Feminist Movement and the Gay Rights Movement.
I would consider this documentary a hybrid of genres. The archival materials and interviews present this film as a historical documentary. That style of film is particularly
challenging for a filmmaker that want to have a more broad audience or theatrical release. Therefore, I believe it was the filmmaker's intention to add the contemporary musicians to make this archival-based historical documentary connect more to the current times and also to draw in viewers who would not normally watch this sort of movie. I felt this was an important decision but I was more connected with the story of the movement in the 60s and felt that the contemporary renditions of the songs were more of an interruption than an asset to the story.",1335571200,,2143,4.972144846796658

4154118,5,B003LUCW7A,"I showed ""Soundtrack for a Revolution"" to my 8th grade students towards the end of our Civil Rights Movement unit, once they were semi-familiar with many of the key events, and they loved it, so much so that many students made random, unsolicited positive comments about the video. ""Soundtrack for a Revolution"" does so much in its 80 minutes (I showed it in segments); I highly recommend its purchase for a personal or school collection.",1331424000,7,438,4.8533333333333335
4154119,5,B003LUCW7A,"History and present existing beautifully in one space. Still absolutely shocking, horrific, heart-pounding, soul-inspiring, and educational on many levels. Caution: Use of this product may cause wry chuckles, misty eyes, red-faced anger, rapid pulse, toe-tappin, head shakin, and a fiery urges to propagate positive change and hugs. States of confusion or clarity may follow.

I think everyone can get something from this - depending how you want to access it. I will buy it. Crisp historical clips, first-source stories, modern interpretation of songs. Critics are a bit scattered in their opinion of the format, but I loved it - the words, visuals, music came together, beating as one heart. It surrounded me, moved me, and made me jump off the couch to go join the revolution. History is happening.

Random books I've enjoyed from a music standpoint - Dr. Daniel J. Levitin, Rebel Musics: Human Rights, Resistant Sounds, and the Politics of Music Making, Real Conversations, No. 1 (Henry Rollins Jello Biafra Lawrence Ferlinghetti Billy Childish) (Real Conversations (Re/Search). There's too many awesome films/docs about these subjects to name.

Yeah, so I forgot - did I mention that I enjoyed this movie?...",1331337600,,1213,5.307291666666667

8399852,5,B003LUCW7A,"This documentary provides a highly engaging overview of some of the major figures and events of the civil rights movement. While other sources (such as the excellent ""Eyes on the Prize"") cover the movement in greater depth and breadth, the combination of first hand accounts and stellar musical performances used in ""Soundtrack for a Revolution"" really pulls in the viewer. ""Soundtrack to a Revolution"" is essentially a series of edited oral histories of the civil rights movement from people who experienced it tied together and organized around some of the songs most associated with the movement rerecorded by contemporary artists. There no narration or textual presentation of information, just the voices of the civil rights figures, documentary footage, and fantastic musical performance. This can be an especially powerful way to introduce younger viewers to this important period of American history. I use this dvd in a 11th grade US history classroom and my students really connect to the content in ways they do not with more traditional documentary material.",1472083200,,1070,5.337278106508876

As a society, many of us grow up learning about the Civil Rights Movement in school, but after a while, the topic loses some of its vitality and impact due to perhaps overexposure and the sugar-coating of content, but this video uses songs from the Movement to act as the vehicle for telling of the bravery exhibited by the people that experienced these historical events.  Their stories are heart-breaking and powerful.  There is a performance where the faces of the casualties of racism stream for a disturbingly long time that I've seen bring tears to the eyes of life-hardened teens.  An awesome documentary.  I can't recommend it highly enough.",1471564800,2,763,4.838461538461538
