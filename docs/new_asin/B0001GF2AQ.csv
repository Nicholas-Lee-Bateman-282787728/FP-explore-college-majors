1997715,2,B0001GF2AQ,"A FORMER GOVERNMENT AGENT HOLDS A TRAIN HOSTAGE WITH A BOMB THAT'LL BLOW UP IF THE TRAIN STOPS AND IT'S UP TO A DETECTIVE TO STOP HIM AND FIND A WAY TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE PASSENGERS. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS BASICALLY ANOTHER IMITATION OF ''SPEED''. THE DIALOGUE IS LAUGHABLE AND THE ACTION [WHICH THERE IS PLENTY OF] IS NOT REALLY THAT ENTERTAINING. THE ACTING IS ALSO PRETTY BAD, BUT THE MOVIE TENDS TO SHOW A FEW SIGNS OF LIFE IN THE LAST 30 MINUTES. IF YOU'RE AN ACTION FAN [LIKE ME] AND YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT THIS MOVIE, RENT IT. BUT DON'T BUY IT. ON THIS DVD, YOU HAVE THE CHOICE OF WATCHING THIS MOVIE DUBBED IN EITHER ENGLISH OR FRENCH OR YOU CAN WATCH THIS MOVIE IN ITS ORIGINAL LANGUAGE, WHICH IS KOREAN.",1099094400,2,712,4.242647058823529

1997718,3,B0001GF2AQ,"this was an entertaining movie that you'd just want to rent and relax for a night...there was a fair amount of action, not as non-stopped as the cover claims....if you haven't seen shiri yet, then i'd recommend watching that before you watch this movie...so who cares if it isn't original and the dvd case cover art is a rip-off from transporter...most action movies today aren't original any more...its more about presentation when it comes to action movies...actors who played jay and T were excellent...my major gripe is the girl...if anything, she was more annoying and some of her lines were very corny...supposedly she's the main star's girlfriend but sure doesn't come off that way....the other criticism is the special forces or swat team in this movie...there's like two bad guys and like 30-50 special forces and they all get slaughtered?  i know its an action flick and there's gonna be some exaggerated elements to it, but even this movie went to far to show the ineptness of the special forces...even shiri was a little more plausible w/ the special forces although they get their butts kicked too by a few guys, but not to the degree as with this movie...still, in the end, it was fun to watch despite the story dulling cuz of the girl",1083369600,,1249,4.782407407407407
1997719,3,B0001GF2AQ,"Woon-Hak Baek did NOT direct OR write ""Shiri"". ""Tube"" is his first and only film. The DVD cover for the R1 release of ""Tube"" from Columbia is therefore confusing, because it is misleading.
Otherwise though, this is a high-action movie that is worth at least a rental. Bae Du-na is wonderful as usual. However, there are many much better films coming out of South Korea these days that deserve more attention. Unfortunately, US companies seem to be mainly interested in action movies. Too bad.",1082678400,,492,4.869047619047619
1997720,2,B0001GF2AQ,"A Hollywood movie went out into the world, traveled to Korea, got assimilated and regurgitated, and now it returns to our shores as this. The studios know it and advertise it using reviews that cast it as the Korean version of Speed. It also ""borrows"" a score straight from Hans Zimmer's work for The Rock, and the main actor looks and acts like Chow Yun Fat light. It's discouraging to see Korean cinema paying homage to American action flicks when it has so many more interesting stories to tell. At least Woon-Hak Baek's first feature, Shiri, spoke in a unique voice and told a story personal to the Korean experience. This is a step backwards for him.
On the other hand, this movie composite of so many action movies we've seen before is fascinating in its skewed familiarity. It's not terrible; the production values are high, the acting occasionally thrilling, the one-liners sometimes amusing. It's no more or less diverting than the average Hollywood Die Hard knockoff. I think of it as top notch karaoke, like American Idol. In the proper context, it's impressive.
In the grand scheme of things, though, it's depressing, especially when Korean directors like Chan-wook Park are producing such unique and energetic work.",1082592000,2,1228,4.93719806763285
1997721,4,B0001GF2AQ,"Korean auteur, Woon-Hak Baek made a splash in North American a few years ago with ""Shiri"" - a political thriller that grabbed the viewer and would not let go.
With ""Tube,"" he does it again.
Think ""Speed"" - but on a train, and with a bad guy who has a genuinely good reason for being as bent and vicious as he is.
""Tube"" is orchestrated almost like a piece of classical music: the opening five minutes is a violent set piece that introduces the villain, the hero and the female lead [who is not *quite* a romantic lead]. Then, the first act brings together the various characters and sets up the situation - much like the first act of a symphony introduces themes and develops them.
The second act finds hero, villain and not-quite-romantic female lead in the midst of the situation, and the third act resolves one situation, to discover that there are contingencies in place.
In the final act/coda, the final resolution is made and a brief tag underscores the bittersweetness of the final victory.
Baek's direction is elegant, calling to mind the balletic qualities of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo [though without the extravagant use of slo mo].
Seok-Hoon Kim's Jay is the unorthodox cop we all love, but with a tragic twist that moves beyond what we're used to. Doo-Na Bae, ""Kay is the not-quite-romantic female lead - a real woman - not one of those exquisite creatures that Hollywood tries to pass of as one [and though she's not beautiful, she has a very powerful, charismatic presence]. Sang-Min Park plays renegade covert ops agent ""T"" as a vicious, evil thug who wasn't ever supposed to wind up that way.
Between the touching emotional moments and the amazing action sequences [one filmed in the real Kimpo Airport, and another filmed in a real train station], there's plenty to keep the viewer on the edge of his seat - and the unexpected climax shows Hollywood how it *should* be done.
Only ""Tube's"" length keeps it from being a five-star film - it could have stood to have five or six minutes trimmed. Still, it's a remarkable piece of work.
With both ""Tube"" and ""Shiri"" to his credit, it's clear that Woon-Hak Baek, who wrote and directed both films, is a force to be reckoned with. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what he does next.
Also worth mentioning are the ""Making Of"" featurette, which is better than expected, the trailer [which captures the feel of the actual film better than most Hollywood trailers] and the music video for the end credits theme song.",1081382400,3,2481,4.692660550458716

8012035,4,B0001GF2AQ,"Unless you absolutely can't handle watching films with subtitles, I must suggest watching the subtitled version of this over the dubbed. Unfortunately, the voice acting in the dubbed version changes the feel and mood of the film dramatically and not in a good way.

First and foremost, this is an action film, so don't expect deep subject matter or significantly stimulating conversational story telling. Additionally, themes widely and easily found in other films and media are reproduced here. However, this film is an example of who method and delivery can take old themes and present them in a way that remains fresh and entertaining. My favorite character is the female lead played by Bae Doo Na (Doona Bae in the credits). While her's is not as significant a role as that of the main protagonist, it's one of the elements that makes the film interesting and enjoyable to watch.

On the negative side, background on certain plot elements is lacking. There are flashbacks that are short and, while obviously designed to elicit an emotional response from the viewer, are disjointed enough that they lack clarity.

Overall, it's an enjoyable film and fans of this genre should not be disappointed.",1357430400,,1199,5.015075376884422
8012036,5,B0001GF2AQ,"It is surprizing to find a Asian marital arts film that has such a detailed story line. You can watch it for both lines or all together. The translation into subtitles could be a tad better, but you won't lose anything watching the sub.",1353024000,,236,4.386363636363637

8012038,5,B0001GF2AQ,The dvd is high quality and I received it very fast. I am very pleased with the product and the service I received. I saw this movie on cable a while back and had it on vhs. I am very glad I found the dvd. Great movie love the action sequences.,1267574400,,244,3.803921568627451
8012039,2,B0001GF2AQ,"While I can't highly recommend it, TUBE is kind of fun, provided you don't think too much about the plot, which has a walking stereotype loose-canon cop (Kim Seok-hoon) battling a terrorist (Pak Sang-min) onboard a hijacked subway train. The terrorist is a former government eraser that the government tried, but failed, to erase, and he's taken the train, and Seoul's mayor, hostage to uhh, well, to apparently have the plan be doomed from the start.

Equal parts SPEED, TAKING OF PELHAM 123, MONEY TRAIN and DIE HARD, the film has few pretensions, which make it easy on the derriere. Poor Bae Doo-na gets one of the stranger film roles in film history, as a pickpocket who apparently knows she must LOVE the hero even before she KNOWS the hero, and creates all the necessary Korean histrionics along the way (as well as almost bearing more physical brutality than the hero!) while our glowering protagonist poses with a series of unlit cigarettes in his mouth (and which only one person will ever be allowed to light, care to guess who?).

The SPEED and TAKING OF PELHAM allusions are apt, as are slight nods to MONEY TRAIN (the hero's boss does his best crazy Robert Blake impersonation) and DIE HARD (or UNDER SIEGE 2 if you'd rather, since it's so blatantly name-checked on the U.S. package), but overall it's a victim of it's own weak (and often downright ridiculous) logic and begs a few too many questions.

Production wise, though, it's delivers the goods, with slick production values all the way, with some nicely handled chase and fight scenes. Turns out, if I read the docu-stuff on the Korean 2-disc set correctly, that the Korean subway trains don't even look as hi-tech as they do here, and the ones in the film were almost entirely CG apart from the sets for close-ups! Columbia Tri-Star's sleeve is highly reminiscent of the art for TRANSPORTER and, not entirely unexpectedly, substitutes a generic Asian face for that of star Kim Seok-hoon. Nice.",1175731200,2,1965,4.8076923076923075
8012040,4,B0001GF2AQ,"I read so many bad comments that I had to watch this again. I still liked it the second time. Not an A film, just a B action with great suspense elements. This is actually better than Speed in some aspects- mainly less two dimensional with the characters (I mean these are better developed). Speed was a slicker product, and I really liked it too. Tube is Korean with a capital K. Made for Koreans. So of course not all American action film fans will like this much. They just make movies differently than Hollywood. I don't buy this as a pure imitation at all- not even very close. This film maker-director is so good at his craft, even his mediocre film (like maybe this one compared to his previous). is quite good. It did have a few slow, and a few really corny places. So I prefer to give it 3 1/2 stars.",1146268800,,809,4.259740259740259
8012041,2,B0001GF2AQ,"This movie is literally a pared down version of ""Speed"".  Instead of a runaway bus, we have a runaway subway instead.  In order to cater to the mass (both males & females), a love interest is added to spice things up.  Then, to unease the tension, a comedian is added into the ensemble (which really doesn't add anything to the movie whatsoever).  So as to have the audience emphatise for the trapped and unfortunate passengers, we have a newly wed loving couple whose husband is the subway controller and who in the end has to choose to obey the instruction to guide the subway to its demise or to do otherwise.  Every movie needs to have a ""baddie"" to hate and that comes in the form of a cowardice passenger who would do everything to satisfy the hostage takers (reminding you of the same person in ""Die Hard""?)  This movie wants us not to hate T.  Rather, audience is brought to the attention of the motivation of why he's committing such an act.  Naturally, a violent act in order to undo another violent act is questionable.  Then, there's the hero character, who's a Bruce Willis pretender rather than Keanu Reeves pretender.  He's a loose cannon but I'm certain that all audience would be baffled by the ending.  His bravado is totally not justified.  Rather than feeling sympathy for him, I'm sure all of you are going to exclaim, ""What the..?""  The Director endeavours to address about a real situation in South Korea where a special commando team is trained to do dirty deeds for the Government but in the end, they are wiped out by the authority that trained them at the first place.  However, this year in South Korea, another drama movie is created to address this incident more specifically and if memory serves me correctly, it becomes one of the highest grossest movie there to date.  Anyway, this movie is filled with individual brilliances but the overall feeling of the movie is too patchy and the plots have spread too thin to the extent that it loses its flavour.  One thing about this DVD is that the characters are adlibbed in English and that frustrates someone like myself who's looking for original flavour.  The making of the movie is passable, the music video clip and the trailer are the better parts of the DVD.  Anyway, commendable effort but in terms of action movies, United States simply has far too much resources to be beatable.  Besides, as Jerry Bruckheimer steps into the TV arena, audience expectation has elevated yet another notch.  What used to be deemed superb ten years ago such as ""Speed"", ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon"" simply don't cut the cake anymore these days.  Well, audience is better off spending their precious two hours elsewhere especially if they have high expectations.",1105833600,,2727,4.723044397463002
8012042,2,B0001GF2AQ,"'Tube' borrows so many things so obviously that it looks like 'Let's spot it' pop quiz.  Some call it Korean 'Speed'; I call is a hybrid of 'Speed ' and one neglected classic 'The Taking of Pelham One, Two ,Three.'  But it comes with awful results now.

Terrorists lead by 'T' (Park Sang-min) hijack the subway full of passangers in Seoul in plain daylight; a fearless detective Jay (Kim Seak Hun) and a lonely girl Kay (Bae Du-na) who loves him are confined in the subway train that rushes at the speed of 140 km.p.h.  Now what will this unconventional cop do?

It's a promising set-up for actioner, and this Korean film tries to show that Asian film industry can do better than 'Speed'; or at least, as good as that.  Sorry, but despite some stylish actions and interesting locales, 'Tube' is in fact a very disappointing piece, with the inconsistent story and overblown emotions.  See, for example, that at one time the train is so crowded that the cop cannot move; then, after some actions, the same train looks totally deserted (and it did not stop).  And this cop is such a daredevil-type that he can jump onto the train (that runs like a car on highway) more than once, and still can gun down the terrorist while the whole SWAT team cannot even touch the hijackers.

There are many, many incredible situations -- incredible, I say, even considering the nature of the film -- which make the film quite ridiculous for action film buffs.  The subway is controlled by computers, they say.  But the men in the control room cannot even stop the train because of some very vaguely shown device the terrorists prepared.  None of them seems to think about the easier way to stop the 'electric' train while they talk aboy ATS or something.

The ending might surprise the Western viewers.  Actually, it is one of the cliched pattern of Korean films, and if you have seen 'Shiri' you know what I mean.  It is way too contrived in order to make it 'touching.'  I know intention, but it is so  awfully carried out.

Korean films are now the power to be reckoned with, I know, but 'Tube' is not the place to prove that.  Only Bae Du-na ('Take Care of My Cat') has something that tells she is going to be a bigger star than she is now.  As to the rest of the film, all I can say is forget about it -- it is way too brainless.",1100649600,,2316,4.4174528301886795
