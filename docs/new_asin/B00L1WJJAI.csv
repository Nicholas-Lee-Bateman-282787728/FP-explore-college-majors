6461035,5,B00L1WJJAI,Blast from the past.  Great quality.  Everyone needs this.,1431302400,5,58,5.333333333333333
6461036,4,B00L1WJJAI,Its exactly how I remembered it as a kid. Was worth the buy.,1424649600,,60,3.6923076923076925
6461037,5,B00L1WJJAI,"I owned the VHS copy of this anime back in the 90's. Well, actually just Fatal Fury 2. Missed the first DVD release of this anime and shied away from buying it used. I don't know who DSC TEK is but I thank them for re-releasing this Fatal Fury anime. Firstly, they were very nice to include both Fatal Fury 1 (Legend Of The Hungry Wolf) and Fatal Fury 2 (The New Battle) on one disc. I had actually never seen Part 1 before so that was a treat. They cleaned up the visuals and audio pretty good. Basically, if you were looking to buy this Fatal Fury anime then this is a very good version to get.",1417564800,10,596,4.059322033898305
6461038,4,B00L1WJJAI,"Classic anime, I recommend this for old school anime lovers.",1415491200,2,60,5.1
6461039,5,B00L1WJJAI,"This is a great release for those who want Fatal Fury OVA and not having to pay $100 for the now OOP Viz version, the quality is pretty much the same and very barebone extras, I own the original Viz release but I'm glad I also bought this, it's dual language with subtitle, and yes the dub is the same as Viz version. This is the uncut Japanese version with Japanese opening and ending sequence, the ending is great as there's more footage (like the scene with Joe in his hotel talking to one of Geese Howard henchmen, and more scene with Tony in a train).

It's not as good of a release as the movie, but I can understand this is OVA so it's difficult to clean the quality, support Eastern Star as they are brining back great and rare classic, if you're a collector, or fan of Fatal Fury and SNK this is a must have.",1408924800,17,817,4.170886075949367
8663152,3,B00L1WJJAI,Ova are alright but video quality....,1530316800,,37,5.333333333333333
8663153,5,B00L1WJJAI,It was a good series. I wish it would've been a longer one but oh well,1513555200,,70,3.4375

8663156,4,B00L1WJJAI,"Arrived in perfect condition and on time! I also noticed extra scenes I've never seen during Fatal Fury 2. However with those scenes, they seem like they should've been scenes viewable in a deleted scenes option, not just thrown into the mix. Maybe it's just me, but the quality in those scenes doesn't match the rest of the movie.",1485043200,3,331,4.627118644067797
8663157,4,B00L1WJJAI,"I should get the big issue with this release out of the way.  The video quality is lacking compared to the long out-of-print previous DVD release from years back.  There is motion blur which means the transfer was not done as well as it could have been.  That being said, I'm beyond ecstatic that Discotek Media re-released these movies because, as I previously stated, the last release has been out-of-print for years.  There's not much in the way of extras here, but that's forgivable seeing how old these OVAs are.  If you're a fighting game fan, you should definitely have this one in your collection as the Fata Fury movies are among the best anime adaptions to be found.",1477008000,2,676,4.647058823529412
8663158,5,B00L1WJJAI,Awesome OVA!  Watching this again brought back memories.  I wish that SNK would create more animated movies/OVAs.  Thanks!,1473984000,2,122,5.666666666666667
8663159,5,B00L1WJJAI,Great movie series,1464220800,2,18,5.333333333333333
8663160,4,B00L1WJJAI,"IT'S OK. COULD'VE BEEN BETTER, BUT DEFINITELY WORTH HAVING IF YOU LIKE JAPANESE ANIME.",1462752000,2,86,5.214285714285714
8663161,3,B00L1WJJAI,"A little disappointed.. They say the complete set but its missing one movie, Fatal Fury 3(which really has nothing to do with the video games).. Still though, its not complete if its missing one movie..",1460505600,4,202,4.8
