8079716,5,B00062IVXU,"Don't be misled - this circa 2004 product is a worthwhile review of GED skills, but it doesn't cover the latest high school equivalency exams. Instead, look for Video Aided Instruction's 2014 versions!",1387756800,,201,5.121212121212121
8079717,3,B00062IVXU,"This DVD was purchased for my daughters as another source for science studies.  The presenter was very dry, and used the word ""literally"" in nearly every sentence. I do not recommend this video for current students; patient adults may benefit however.",1301356800,,251,5.121951219512195
8079718,5,B00062IVXU,"The video aided instructions programs are video tutors. This, and all video aided instructions Pre-GED video programs are excellent study tools, for anyone who needs to brush up on academics before taking the GED test. I highly recommend this program. I tried these videos, as well as Jason Gibson's MathTutor DVDs, which is another program that I highly recommend, before taking the GED test and I passed it with ease. I also may suggest using flash cards when studying. Flash cards also helped me lock important things down for long term recall. Give yourself lots of practice before taking the test, because it pays off in your test scores. Good luck! Leonard Greene.",1255996800,,670,4.938053097345133
