7851454,3,6303549322,"BIOHAZARD: THE ALIEN FORCE is a good example of how it doesn't take megabucks, 'names' or ver-the-top SFX to make a decent sci-fi feature. While clearly not ""GODZILLA"", BIOHAZARD is an engaging  sci-fi/horror/conspiracy yarn of a laboratory-designed ""living  weapon"" (L.U.C.I.) designed to survive ANYTHING, even nuclear war.  Growing into an unstoppable BLACK LAGOON-type monster, LUCI hunts down its  human 'tissue donors' while the ruthless corporation that created it hunts  down any witnesses to its handiwork. (Only thing that doesn't fly is  ""THE ALIEN FORCE"" Part, 'cause it's wholly terrestrial &  manmade). Decent writing & performances in a less than $1M budget. Of  course, I suppose I'm a bit biased 'cause I'm the 'male model' that gets  ground into the floorboards by the beautiful sculptress!",937526400,2,808,5.451612903225806
