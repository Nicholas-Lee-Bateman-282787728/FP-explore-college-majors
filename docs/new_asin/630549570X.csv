1036674,3,630549570X,"This movie is about a woman named Janey(Judy Thompson)and her boyfriend who works as a teaching assistant. Janey thinks that her boyfriend is having an affair with another woman and in a rage one day she wishes him dead and leaves him but when she comes back she finds him murdered. Janey soon finds out that her dead boyfriend was a drug dealer and has to find the person that murdered him. She gets some help from her long lost friend(played by Kim Yates)and also the Teacher who her boyfriend worked for. This movie has the run of the mill erotic thriller plot of who dunnit but this thing also has one of the hottest women on the planet Kim Yates in it. Kim Yates has a couple of very good sex scenes in this thing and also has a nice Girl/Girl scene with Judy Thompson. For those of you that don't know of Kim Yates she is a very beautiful softcore porn actress that kind of looks like Gwen Stefani in this movie. The other actress in this thing(Judy Thompson)is also very beautiful,she gets down and dirty with Men,women and even with herself in this movie. The only thing that holds this film back is the script and the plot but then again who cares,this movie has enough hot sex in it to make any softcore porn fan happy. On a final note make sure you get the UNRATED version of the movie because the R-rated version has all the sex taken out. If you want to see softcore movies the way they were meant to be seen then ALWAYS GET UNRATED VERSION!ALWAYS!",1187136000,17,1461,4.335766423357664

1036676,4,630549570X,"Teach me Tonight is a murder mystery. Well, it's supposed to be, but you know how erotic mysteries go. It's more like who's going to get naked next, and to whom are they going to do it.

So does Teach me Tonight follow that familiar, successful format. Pretty much - lots of skin and lots of simulated (I think it's simulated) coitus, moderately well done, but there really is a mystery involved in this movie - who the hell is Judy Thompson? Other than being the remarkably gorgeous, fleshy star of this movie, she is an enigma. She appeared in no movies, either before or after, and a search for the inscrutable shapely brunette, on the internet, provides no answers. I have some thoughts on that, which I'll discuss later, but in the meantime, we have a movie to review.

Teach me Tonight is, as you have probably guessed, an erotic softcore movie. The plot is a average one, but we don't watch these movies for the plot, do we?

The lovely and mysterious Judy Thompson plays Janie, a graduate biochemistry student, who couples in an opening sex scene with her live in lover, teaching assistant, Michael (Rob Moser) in a back room at the university. Later at their apartment, thinking Michael has been unfaithful they have a argument and Janie leaves. Meanwhile while Janie spends the night at her wacky friend Frankie's (Kim Yates) pad, returning the next day to her bloodstained apartment. It seems Michael has managed to get himself whacked.

Police Det. O'Rourke suspects Janie killed him, while she thinks, Frankie (Kim Yates) did it, so in order to clear herself Janie begins a parallel investigation.

As you might suspect, her investigation is sometimes undertaken, unburdened by garments and often finds her investigating, the physical attributes of various suspects, including her college professor, Sterling Manville, and his wife Ariana. The professor and his wife, acting concerned and feigning friendship, drug Jamie with a strong aphrodisiac and proceed to have a threesome. Afterward, in a drugged condition, Janie stumbles upon alarming indications that she may be in the home of the murderers.

Conclusion

As softcore movies go, I considered this one slightly above average. The story was a little better than average. If you haven't guessed I liked Judy Thompson and enjoyed the quirky Frankie. The acting was decent as were the several sex scenes. The erotic highlight of the film was when Janie watching a hardcore movie, masturbated. It was intense.

When judging a softcore movie, I grade on a curve. I rate these movies against other movies within the adult movie field. These films tend to have low budgets, less experienced actors, if actors at all and the screenplays tend to be unbelievable or hokey. The obvious intention of these movies, and I don't believe anyone would watch them for any other reason, is to provoke sexual stimulation. (The definition of pornography) With those things in mind, I found the Teach me Tonight to be slightly above average, so I rated it, 3 ? stars.

I'm still at a loss as to why Judy Thompson of the bodacious body, never appeared in anything before or after this flick. Maybe Judy Thompson was a pseudonym used by Jennifer Love Hewitt when she was just getting started. Alternatively, maybe she was a college girl working at the nearby Starbucks, who caught the director's eye, making one movie before returning to her studies. On the other hand, just maybe, the originally scheduled actress had a scheduling conflict, leaving the producer high and dry, forcing him to use his trophy wife as Janie. In any event, in my opinion, Judy Thompson was a visual treat worth checking out..",1145404800,28,3803,4.853168469860896
1036677,4,630549570X,"I really enjoyed this film. The plot was just ok but lets face it guys....do we really watch these kind of movies for the plot? If I wanted to watch a movie with a good plot I would get something that was directed by Ron Howard or Steven Spielberg.

Anyway, Judy Thompson is really hot. And the blonde who plays her friend has a smoking body even though her face is only average. They share a very steamy sex scene that would give the dead a hard on. However, my favorite scene was Thompson's masturbation scene. The only knock on the movie was that we did not get to see enough of the professors wife. I would have liked to see her and Thompson do a sex scene alone together. I recommend this to every horny male out there!",1142899200,6,724,4.2086330935251794
1036678,2,630549570X,"A typical exotic thriller, ""Teach Me Tonight"" does not offer any valuable lessons.  The first scam presented by this film is that the seductive beauty on the movie cover is not even in the movie!  Big let down right off.  The real main character has short, dark hair, terrible implants, and best yet - plays a biochemistry graduate student!  The first sex scene is pretty hot - gives the impression the movie might have something to offer - further analysis proves that all the sex scenes are pretty much the same; same positions, actors, music and sequence of events!!  There are three scenes that stand out not due to their excellence but simply for their change from the typical scenes the movie offers.  Over all, this film (obviously) does not present strong plot or characters.  If you are looking for sex scenes every five minutes - this will do.  But don't expect anything original, impressive or creative.",1014422400,95,914,4.777070063694268
1036679,3,630549570X,"The plot is bad, the acting is bad, the photography is bad, the editing is bad - but there's sex, so this movie rounds out to be a suitable porno flick.
The main character has rather obvious implants, but the other two  ladies you get to see are natural (albeit small).
The DVD quality isn't  fabulous, but I didn't expect it to be. This isn't a big budget blockbuster  film. All in all, it's better than the best VHS quality I've seen.
The  audio is rather poorly mixed. Dialogue gets extremely quiet at times, and  after you turn up the volume to accomodate for this, you end up getting  blasted by the cheesy porno theme music.
This movie gets 3 stars because  I really can't justify giving any movie of its genre more than that. There  you go.",961977600,16,747,4.36231884057971

For what this product is worth it's not bad. Sure there's the flimsy (at best) plot, the bad dialogue, worse script, and every actor/actress has about as much of a delivery with their lines as one would expect in a B-Softcore porn movie. The only thing going for it is the rather steamy scenes of ""action"" and the two female leads.
