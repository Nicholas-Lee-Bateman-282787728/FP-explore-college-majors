8388896,2,B0035ECHOK,"This is a Canadian TV movie. On the positive side, they do a pretty good job of making the movie look like it is set in the southern US even though they are using sets in Canada. That's about the best thing I can say about the film. It is the story of a hurricane hunter crew that flies into a hurricane on a routine flight. Supposedly their hurricane is a small one compared to a monster that is about to hit the Texas Gulf coast. There are a number of people on the flight, all with their own situations. The most notable is the character played by Darryl Hannah who was orphaned as a child when her parents were killed in a hurricane. She appears to be fighting ghosts of the event throughout the movie. The character development is paper thin and cliche. The acting is spotty. Some scenes are ridiculously overplayed, especially the ones in which the director of the storm center inexplicably refuses to even listen to his experts who say the hurricane is likely to grow and hit land. There are a number of statements of dubious scientific merit, including an extremely half-hearted attempt to deny global warming by a journalist. There are a few action scenes that show promise towards the beginning of the film, but by the end, they just become silly. A number of people get sucked out the door of the plane but the two main characters manage to save themselves when the suction somehow apparently is suspended while they pull each other back in. Of course there is little mention of their token guy who was pushing buttons before he got sucked out the door. In any case, the movie is somewhat watchable, but it's about as poorly done as most low-budget disaster films, but without much character development or even much of a romantic angle. In a way, the movie seems like a half-baked attempt to create a low-budget rip-off of Twister but involving hurricanes. I cannot recommend the movie very highly, but if you like cheesy disaster films, you might find this one to be acceptable.",1380326400,2,1991,4.579831932773109

8388898,3,B0035ECHOK,"I have watch a lot of movies over the years and I watch a lot of movies that don't get a lot of press and what I would like or not some one might like them, so I am not going to give a review on this or any other movie It's for you to see and make up your own mind.",1347148800,,265,3.2903225806451615
8388899,5,B0035ECHOK,"Natural disaster movies are great to watch, especially most action taking place in an airline trapped inside the deadly eye of a hurricane.  I really liked the movie but somehow a lot of the disastrous effects portrayed are not convincing enough.  It is like you went to see a magic show and when it is done, you say, that's it?  I forgot this is a low budget movie.",1336435200,,366,4.352941176470588
