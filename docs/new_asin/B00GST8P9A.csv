6111046,3,B00GST8P9A,"A very  good  video  well instructed , good cues and  challenging for me .  I would recommend this for intermediate's.",1404086400,3,118,4.7
6111047,1,B00GST8P9A,"I just think it was a little like a Jane Fonda workout, less yoga, more exercise than I'd hoped fot",1403913600,6,99,4.0
6111048,5,B00GST8P9A,"I wish Colleen could take her PlumTV videos (featured on YouTube) and transfer them to dvds we could buy.  I love those videos and I would like to know if the background music featured on the videos was created for her or if that music can be purchased on cd.

I just ordered this dvd and will post a follow-up review after I view and do it.

When time is limited and you would like to continue your daily yoga practice AND your daily cardio practice, well, this dvd workout, as described, is  a fusion of both practices.  What a terrific solution.  Don't you think?

Hoosiers do have good ideas!  And Colleen was born a Hoosier!

Update:

Received and watched the dvd and it's beautiful.

This will definitely be a part of my yoga regimen.",1402444800,3,740,4.407407407407407
6111049,5,B00GST8P9A,Colleen's verbal instruction is so detailed and accurate after two sessions I didn't need to look at the screen to follow the poses.  There are 5 different practices on the DVD and they are well balanced to include the whole body.  The pace is even.  Each practice is only 15 to 25 minutes in length (I don't have an hour every day to practice).  It's quickly become my favorite yoga DVD.  I'm fit but not extremely flexible.  I learned several new poses from this DVD and I feel calm but refreshed after practicing with Colleen.  Bottom line:  I look forward to pressing play on this DVD.  I recommended this DVD to my sister and she likes it as well.  I'd say it's for the beginner to intermediate yogi.,1400630400,22,705,4.4375
6111050,2,B00GST8P9A,"This is probably the oddest yoga DVD I've seen.  In her effort to ""kill"" calories she loses any flow sequencing and it's just bizarre. Do not recommend",1400198400,9,151,4.592592592592593
6111051,4,B00GST8P9A,"I have been doing yoga for over a year now.  I have found that Rodney Yee and Colleen Saidman are the best at teaching yoga.  I, however, prefer Colleen's videos.  The rhythm is just right, not too intense, and not too mild either.  I've gotten in great shape with these yoga videos (and also with aerobic exercise).  It is not easy in the beginning, but with practice you will get progressively better.  Colleen walks you through all the moves with clarity and precision.  Colleen's voice is soothing and positive too.  Update:  The music could be better.  Also, I wish colleen would slow down while going through the poses.  In my opinion, yoga is about connecting to a higher power.  She seems to fly through the poses.  Now that I am more connected and more experienced with yoga, I find that slowing the poses down has a better effect on me and I get better mental/emotional results. Thanks",1398384000,11,895,4.624203821656051

6111073,4,B00GST8P9A,5 separates yoga classes.  I loved it!,1457395200,2,38,4.428571428571429
6111074,5,B00GST8P9A,love. love. love. Great work out and a fun way to burn calories. I have never done a yoga practice quite like this. I feel strangely calm after these practices.,1449446400,,160,4.366666666666666
6111075,5,B00GST8P9A,"This is one of my FAVORITE yoga DVDs ever! But allow me to clarify my own yoga journey and practice. At this point, I am probably somewhere between intermediate and advanced. I prefer high-energy yoga practices, such as vinyasa flow. (I started with The Biggest Loser trainers' yoga DVDs.) Yoga is the only form of exercise in which I routinely engage; therefore, I feel that I need to make it worth my while. This DVD is amazing, if you like that type of yoga. Colleen is an excellent instructor. Although she does move quickly, that is to be expected from this type of yoga. Surely anyone purchasing a DVD of this nature would understand that BEFORE purchasing the DVD. Anyhow, the practices are relatively short, but believe me when I say you'll feel the burn with each one. I would say these exercises are for beginners,  ready to jump into the land of intermediate practice. They will challenge you at first, but you'll never advance if you don't challenge yourself.

With all of the available workouts on this DVD, I use it often. I highly recommend it .",1441324800,10,1060,4.632978723404255
6111076,2,B00GST8P9A,"Not what I was hoping for. I guess I expected it to be more for beginners. Not that I am a beginner, but sometimes I like to go slower than usual.",1431820800,,146,3.7419354838709675
6111077,1,B00GST8P9A,"Definitely a let down with this video.  I've taken a lot of yoga classes practicing different traditional methods.  I have some other DVDs that are very good and follow traditional techniques.  This DVD however is nothing I've ever seen before.  I understand that they need to pack in a lot in 20 minutes, but the speed is way too fast and puts the user at risk for injury.  Yoga should be meditative and focused on technique without putting any impact on your joints.  I've never seen jumping jacks while hugging yourself in any yoga practice, ever.  The crunches too, bicycling your knees to alternate elbows to increase core strength, isn't that more like Jane Fonda or Richard Simmons?  No, this isn't yoga in the traditional method at all.  I will give them some credit, there are asanas in there that are traditional, but most of it is purely westernized and diluted.  I would rather spend that 20 minutes focusing on holding a few asanas  rather than quickly cycling through many different asanas without learning proper technique and risking injury.  Also, for the beginner they do not offer any modified poses.  So if you can't already twist yourself into a pretzel quickly, you will regret this purchase.  After practicing the rise & shine portion my sciatica was more inflamed than ever before.",1431388800,5,1305,4.846153846153846
6111078,2,B00GST8P9A,"I am not a fan. It's really just one long ""yoga"" work out. I was expecting different sections, where the poses would be dimmonsteated.
Nope.
It just jumps from one move to the next and hopefully you can memorize the video quickly.
I actually meant to buy a different Dvd but accidental put this one in my cart. My mistake, should have sent it back but thought I would give it a try. Don't like it at all. Might be good for someone who is just starting out working out and need a slow push back into working out with low impact.",1429488000,,527,4.176470588235294

6111080,3,B00GST8P9A,"To be fair I haven't did all the workouts as of yet, but I'm not really feeling this video. The instructor does give good instructions and cueing but the moves are a little weird and after doing the ""constant cardo"" sequence I didn't really feel like i worked out.  I think it's a good video if you want to take it easy or you really are into yoga, I like yoga but I like more of cardio or fusion workout.",1413849600,2,405,4.0625
6111081,3,B00GST8P9A,To be honest I had a hard time getting into these yoga routines.  I feel like she moves too fast.  I'm familiar with the basics of yoga and I still felt kinda lost doing this.  Def. not my favorite. I've gotten much better DVD's than this.,1412208000,6,239,4.1521739130434785
8627172,5,B00GST8P9A,"As other reviewers have already noted, Colleen Saidman's instructions are clear and timely. I consider myself an intermediate and found each of the workouts to flow well and be well paced. Fans of this DVD may also want to check out Colleen's Yoga for Weight Loss. It too is well done. The only thing I found a little disconcerting about the DVD was that it was advertised as having five workouts, but there are actually six workouts listed on the menu. Turns out that although they have different names, two of the works (Constant Cardio and Calorie Killer Workout) are the same routine. No biggy---just a touch confusing. All in all, the DVD is great.",1522972800,,653,4.6869565217391305

8627176,3,B00GST8P9A,I'm not sure why people are saying it's too fast or challenging.  I found this dvd too easy!  I certainly didn't feel like I was 'killing calories' but I do enjoy this dvd for a day when I want to keep my workout simple and easy.,1513814400,,229,3.9565217391304346

8627179,2,B00GST8P9A,"I just started yoga so I'm definitely a beginner. This video is not relaxing at all! The instructor is rather annoying! Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale...I get it. It's like she's yelling at you. I was hoping for a more friendly yoga DVD, but this was not it. She goes kind of fast too, and you barely get to do the move then she moves onto the next move. Passing on this one.",1487462400,,375,4.222222222222222
8627180,5,B00GST8P9A,"I think this DVD is excellent and I am surprised by some of the negative reviews.  I have several DVDs by Colleen Saidman Yee and her husband Rodney Yee.  They are two of my favorite yoga instructors.  I usually do some type of yoga practice daily.  I got this DVD last week and I have done all five of the workouts already and I expect to use this DVD often because I like it so much.  I did notice that a couple of the workouts did have a faster pace, but I believe that is to help burn more calories as the title of the DVD indicates.  I would recommend watching them ahead of time to become more familiar with the moves if the pace is too fast.  The ""Balance and Restore"" practice is one of the slower-paced options.  I like that there are several balance postures in these practices because those are often overlooked in yoga DVDs.  On a more superficial note, these are filmed in a beautiful, peaceful setting and Colleen looks gorgeous in every workout.  I really enjoy these practices and look forward to doing them almost every day.  If you like yoga, I would recommend this.",1479254400,5,1084,4.37
