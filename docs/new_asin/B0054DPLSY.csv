4565923,5,B0054DPLSY,"The best part of this DVD, is you can select which half inning to start viewing, so you don't need to watch the whole game in one sitting. Because the whole game is more than 3 hours long. I'm a Phillies fan, and it's great to see my favorite players like Schmidt, Bowa, Rose, and others take the field. Greg Luzinski wasn't in the line-up. I think he did pinch hit. And I think this is before Manny Trillo was on the team, so we have a 2nd baseman I never heard of playing. But the others are well-known guys like McBride, Maddox, and Boone. Cubs fans can enjoy this game too, as Dave Kingman and Bill Buckner have monster games at the plate. Pitchers didn't have a very good day.",1320451200,6,681,4.206106870229007
4565924,5,B0054DPLSY,Many future Hall of Fame players in a great game during a great era. Wrigley Field looks great. Nice to see Dave Kingman's long bomb over Waveland Ave.,1319328000,,151,4.428571428571429
4565925,5,B0054DPLSY,"I remember seeing some show hosted by Steve Garvey years ago, where he would spend about an hour showing highlights of great past baseball games. This Cubs/Phillies game was one of them. I remember how I wished I had recorded it. Now seeing that they have the entire game on DVD, I had to get it. This game has always intrigued me even more than other classics such as the Gibson game and other playoff games. I mean the Phillies had a 21-9 lead, only to have the Cubs come back and tie it. 11 homeruns total, Schmidt, Rose, Bowa, Kingman, big afros...epic 1979. I did order it and it just arrived today. I've only watched the first inning, but the picture quality is great. Sharper than all of the Youtube clips. I definitely recommend this to any baseball fan. Not a nail-biter, just fun, out of control classic daytime Wrigley madness.",1318464000,5,838,4.519736842105263
4565972,5,B0054DPLSY,this dvd brings back memories from the game at chicago.  we actually saw this game when it was being played and could not believe the final score.,1393545600,,146,4.407407407407407
4565973,4,B0054DPLSY,"Even though the Chicago Cubs lost this game, Cub fans or baseball fans will enjoy this dvd. A typical, wind blowing out game in the summer at Wrigley Field. There were 45 runs scored, no lead was safe, and the whole pitching staff was used by both sides and the game was not decided until the end.",1393286400,,297,4.228070175438597
4565974,4,B0054DPLSY,"Kind of like opening a time capsule.  I grew up outside of Detroit so never really got to watch many National League games.  I knew about Schmidt and Rose from the World Series against the Royals in 1980.  But I don't think I ever saw Dave Kingman play.  A lot of the other guys were familiar to me only from collecting baseball cards.  It was neat just listening to the commentary.  For example, the crowd booed Pete Rose when he came to the plate and the announcer said it was because he left the Reds for more money.  Apparently back then it wasn't cool to betray your team and its fans just to make more money for playing a game.  My, how times have changed.  These days that's fully expected and accepted (although I still think its crap).  I generally don't buy DVDs because who really wants to watch it more than once?  But it was worth the low sale price to go back in time for a few hours.",1374019200,,898,4.223529411764706
4565975,5,B0054DPLSY,The fact that you can listen to the phillies radio broadcast automatically rates this 5 star worthy.  Great game and good picture quality.  Now if mlb can produce the april 17th 1976 phillies cubs game where mike schmidt hits 4 homers and the phillies win 18 -16.  Look it up mlb!!,1363478400,2,281,4.470588235294118
4565976,5,B0054DPLSY,"I am a big Phillies' fan, and watching this game for the first time was fun.  I played the radio broadcast, because it was the Phillies' broadcast, and even though it was maybe 2 seconds out of sync, it was worth it.  I even listened to the Cubs' TV broadcast afterwards, and it was still fun.",1360972800,,293,4.214285714285714
4565977,5,B0054DPLSY,Loved the game.  Remember listening to it a week or so before graduating high school.  Great to hear Brickhouse and Boudreau describe the action as only they could.,1358985600,,164,4.821428571428571
4565978,5,B0054DPLSY,I saw this game on MLB network and I want to own a copy of it. This game is exciting from first pitch to last.,1357776000,,110,3.44
4565979,5,B0054DPLSY,"In the summer of 1977 I was nearly seven and old enough to start noticing and becoming interested in sports.  In my small town in Southwest Michigan, we could pick up WGN from across the lake and I became a big Chicago Cubs fan.  All Cubs home games were played during the day then and were all televised by WGN, and during the months of baseball season that school was in session I'd frequently watch the last few innings when I got home.

Thursday, May 17, 1979 was no ordinary day, though--when I turned on the TV, I couldn't believe that the Cubs were down 21-9 to the Phillies.  Even as a third grader, I knew I was watching a game I'd never forget as my team clawed its way back into it, tying the game at 22-22 before finally falling 23-22 in ten innings.

I was thrilled to see the game available on DVD.  It seems that there were many other Cubs-Phillies slugfests at Wrigley Field in the late Seventies and early Eighties (I distinctly recall a 12-11 Cubs win in June 1982), but none of them compared to this contest.  I later learned that the score was 7-6 after the first inning, which neither starting pitcher survived.  Bill Buckner and Dave Kingman were two of my favorite players then, and they both had huge days, and Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose came up big for Philadelphia that day.

While watching the game you can choose between hearing the Phillies' radio broadcast or the Cubs' television broadcast.  Jack Brickhouse was a great announcer for the Cubs, and it was great to hear his ""Hey Hey!"" home run call after all these years.  At one point in the broadcast, Brickhouse said that ""we've got ourselves a real marathon""...in the third inning when the score was 11-6 and less than 40 percent of the runs had been scored.  This game definitely had a late Seventies feel, too, with the powder blue road uniforms that were en vogue at the time, and in a couple of spots you can even hear typewriters clicking away in the background in the press box.  It was also interesting to recall Wrigley Field minus some of the bells and whistles that exist today.

I can recall looking at the outrageous box score in the paper the next day and may even have cut it out, knowing it was a game to remember.  Even today, when you type ""Cubs Phillies"" into Internet search engines, two of the leading suggestions offered are ""23-22"" and ""1979.""  It was a treat to finally watch the game in its entirety a third of a century later, and even though I knew the final outcome, while watching the late innings I found myself wishing that the Cubs could have pulled out a win in this classic.",1339113600,4,2591,4.434599156118144
4565980,4,B0054DPLSY,"Easily one of the most exciting baseball games ever, great nostalgia too.  If you are interested in this game, you pretty much know what happened, I won't spoil the details.  Obviously there were a ton of runs scored.  Also of note, some of the best and most memorable players of the late 1970's/early 1980's participated in this game, including Mike Schmidt, Bill Buckner, Pete Rose, Dave Kingman, Tug McGraw, Bruce Sutter, Larry Bowa, and many more.  The Phillies were loaded with talent at this point, and went on to win the World Series the following season.  The Phillies had also won the day's previous game at Wrigley by a score of 13-0.  But the Cubs had a pretty good team themselves at this point, going 48-38 in the first half of 1979 before collapsing (naturally) in the second half to finish a disappointing 80-82.  On this sunny day in at beautiful Wrigley Field however, Cub fans were optimistic, as usual in mid May.  If you are a fan of the Cubs or Phillies of this era, or even just wish to experience the nostalgia of the late 1970's at Wrigley Field, this affordably priced DVD is for you.

One thing I'll suggest is to not look at the back of the DVD case (prior to viewing the entire game), as it lists various highlights as well as presenting the inning-by-inning score of the game.  Regarding picture quality, it's actually surprisingly good for the era.  Obviously not remotely HD-quality, but the picture seems fairly comparable to what you'd have seen in 1979 if you watched it live, with perhaps some minor degradation due to time.  Although the picture does look slightly ""fuzzy"" (soft focus) from the outfield camera (showing the live view of the batter), this seems to have been as it was at that time - as the close up views from other cameras give you quite a sharp picture. Some of the time the reds seem pinkish, especially on the Phillies uniforms, although other times (from other camera angles) the reds are true deep red, so again this is likely simply the game as presented, rather than a problem of tape degradation. All in all though, it's more than watchable quality, really good for the era. The tv announcers are Jack Brickhouse (for all but 3 innings) and Lou Boudreau (for 3 innings), which adds to the nostalgia for Cubs fans.  Alternately, you can choose to listen to the Phillies radio broadcast as you watch the action, via a language option.  There's even a brief appearance by beloved college basketball coach Ray Meyer, and also by a Chicago Bulls player (John Mengelt) who speaks about a couple of young NBA prospects who'd just finished their college careers - Magic Johnson and Larry Bird!

So what's the flaw here?  Well it's missing a tiny bit of the action.  There are two points (that I noticed) where the first pitch is not shown, you see what you think is the first pitch and then are told it's ""1 and 1"", or ""0 and 2"" or whatever.  Those two points don't matter much, BUT, there's a dramatic point in the game where Dave Kingman strides toward the batter's box as the next batter... and.... they don't show any of that at-bat!  Basically you see Kingman approaching the batter's box, and the next thing you see is Steve Ontiveros standing at the plate, ready to face his first pitch of his own at-bat.  Huh?  So an important, high-drama at-bat was missed entirely (other than the build-up ahead of it), and for that I'm dinging this by one star.  You can figure out what happened (sort of), but it would have been great to see that at-bat. There are no special features, save for the language options and ability to start at any half-inning you choose.  There's no post-game wrap-up, no years-after-the-fact interviews.  The game just starts (it does include some brief pre-game introductions) and then ends just a few moments after the last out.  But it's still great to see this, and at this price, no special features are needed.  Obviously the DVD makers would have loved to show that Kingman at-bat, but I assume it was lost for some reason, and it's better to see all this than nothing at all.  Thanks to MLB Properties, A&E etc. for this well-done offering of a memorable game and time period.",1337990400,10,4164,4.622282608695652
4565981,4,B0054DPLSY,"Make no mistake about it, this is not HD quality film. It is old and it is grainy and it is devoid of the flash and player stat animations and graphics that baseball fans have become accustomed to over the last decade. That being said, this is one of the single most exciting baseball games ever played. The high score was attributed to the wind in Wrigley Field. It was a particularly blustery day in Chicago and it seemed as if every ball hit high had a chance to be blown out of the park.

The final score of 23-22 is one of the highest combined scores of all time. It's great watching greats like Mike Schmidt, Pete Rose, Larry Bowa, and ""King-Kong"" Kingman again, still in their prime, and to see old pitchers like Tug McGraw and Dennis Lamp take the mound once more. Whats even more great is watching both teams swinging for the fences in an epic battle. Neither team willing to succumb, deadlocked at 22 all and going into extra-innings, until Mike Schmidt drove in the final run in the top of the 10th to finally end it. A game I could watch over and over again - and I'm not even a Phillies or Cubs fan!

The DVD is basic overall but does have one great feature, you are able to not only select which inning you would like to see, but also which half of the inning which is an awesome feature.

Overall, a great DVD of an amazing game for a good price.",1330387200,5,1361,4.226923076923077

8456527,5,B0054DPLSY,Great game...Kingmans blast was awe wait for it some!!,1458259200,,54,5.111111111111111
8456528,5,B0054DPLSY,"I got this DVD and watched the whole game...it is truly one of the most hilarious baseball games I ever saw.

The Philadelphia Phillies took on the Chicago Cubs in Wrigley Field, and, as Roger Angell wrote, ""Fair stood the breeze for France!"" Aided by a stiff wind, the Cubs scored 22 runs, three of them by Dave Kingman, one a grand slam by Bill Buckner (who deserves to be remembered better).

One should think such an offensive outburst would have put the game in the Cubs' pocket, but the Phillies scored 23 runs, one of them coming off a solo home run by starting pitcher Randy Lerch in the first inning! He didn't have much time to celebrate -- he was in the showers by the bottom of the first inning himself. Neither starter (Dennis Lamp for the Cubs) got through the first inning. The Phils jumped off to a huge lead early, the Cubs kept fighting back, and the game was tied at 22-22 in the 10th, when Mike Schmidt unloaded his second home run of the day to put the game away.

Both teams used Wrigley Field an offensive pinball machine, setting records for combined team hits, doubles, and home runs, and neither side distinguished itself for pitching and defense. After a while, the game turns into an exercise in hilarity, with a bemused Jack Brickhouse trying to explain it all.

A knowledgeable baseball fan will recognize some of the names in the game: Mike Schmidt, Pete Rose, Dave Kingman, Bill Buckner, Tug McGraw, Ron Reed, Bruce Sutter, Donnie Moore, Bob Boone, Bake McBride, Bobby Murcer, Garry Maddox, Greg Luzinski (pinch-hitting), and Larry Bowa. Some of the players are obscure, perhaps only known to their families: Rudy Meoli, Barry Foote, Steve Ontiveros, Greg Gross, Mike Vail, and Rawlins J. Eastwick III, the game's winning pitcher.

Technically, the game is fascinating to watch. The tape was three-quarter-inch with the harsh colors of the period, and lacks the sharpness of today's High-Def DVDs. The camera angles are pretty simple and limited, and the only graphics in the game are the end-of-inning linescores. It doesn't even post the ball-and-strike counts, or the batting averages of the hitters as they come to the plate. Brickhouse is the sole announcer for seven innings -- I'm not sure who does the middle three.

Compare this with today's coverage -- multiple camera angles, graphics that include pitch location, no detailed statistics, and a single announcer, clearly doing it in radio style. There's no analysis of any sort. I had to sit there and figure out for myself that neither starting pitcher had decent stuff, that Tug McGraw was particularly awful, and that high winds were taking balls deep. On the other hand, I was spared the modern sponsoring stuff -- in which every single thing in the game is sponsored by somebody -- lawyers for the copyright notice, stock trading services for home runs, anti-auto carjack devices for ""caught stealing.""

There are some holes in the broadcast...one of Dave Kingman's unsuccessful at-bats is unresolved, and I'm not sure how Bobby Murcer got in the game for the Cubs, either as a defensive replacement or as a pinch-hitter.

I would also have liked to have seen the MLB Network do some interviews with the survivors of this game, who doubtless have strong memories of this long afternoon, the way they did with other historic recent baseball games. Their memory would have obviously been jogged by the video, and it would have been entertaining.

These quibbles notwithstanding, this DVD is a hilarious, enjoyable, and long afternoon at Wrigley Field.",1451865600,,3546,4.867330016583748
