3959662,5,B002NN7EXS,Love this series and so glad to see it finally come to DVD!!  Zwick and Herskovitz...amazing! The best series ever!,1263686400,,115,4.75
3959663,5,B002NN7EXS,"I had forgotten how good and original this series was. 16 years since I first watched it, it still delights, and has not aged, but matured. Some episodes would win awards as free standing dramas. The characterization is excellent, the performances outstanding, the drama real and moving, and the team work unequalled since The Big Chill. The direction and writing deserved the awards they won. Five stars.",1258848000,19,405,5.059701492537314

3959702,5,B002NN7EXS,"As the critic said on NPR, Thirtysomething gets better as the seasons progress.  Season One seems a little trite and/or contrived but heading into season two the actors seems to get the grip of things and play against each other in very believable ways.  The depth of the characters is remarkable and I have never seen this in a show that was made so early on.  The parody of Woody Allen's early movies and the well done and executed flash backs are excellent, as well.  I would recommend this to everyone!",1430524800,,506,4.527472527472527

3959714,5,B002NN7EXS,"When I was a young wife and mom in the late eighties I had a part time waitressing job so I could put myself through school. I remember rushing home every Tuesday night to get there by 10:00pm so I could watch Thirtysomething. Even now, this is still my favorite show. I love the way the characters interacted and how they all really cared about each other. These people knew what it meant to be a friend. When I I recently started watching it again on Amazon Prime it felt like coming home.

I was also fascinated by the mind game interaction between Michael, Elliot and the disturbing Miles Drentell. That guy's mamma didn't bring him up right! It was like watching knights mentally jousting. And the episode with Stanley Tucci as DAA's creative director who tortures Michael should not be missed. If you want to watch a show about real life with witty dialogue and interesting situations that will leave you wanting more, this is it.",1389830400,,936,4.604790419161676
3959715,5,B002NN7EXS,"Everything about this series is first class...from the writing to the direction to every member of its stellar ensemble cast.

The DVDs arrived promptly, well-packaged. Thirtysomething is a late 80s made for TV ensemble drama about a group of bonded believable babyboomer yuppies in their 30s hence the title. The program lasted for only four years. The characters and story lines dealt with real life issues such as life, money, parents, friendship, marriage, death, idealism, searches for security, raising children, measuring success and how to survive failures as this group of believable characters spiral downward into mid-life.
Definitely worth the purchase to see these characters again.  But beware you will be watching them after you have aged 30-something-years.",1373500800,,655,5.616161616161616
3959722,5,B002NN7EXS,"Easy checkout, fast delivery and great quality.  Have loved going back in time to watch my favorite Thirtysomething Friends.  Ordered the 3rd and 4th seasons and cannot wait to start watching them.",1368144000,,197,5.125
3959723,4,B002NN7EXS,"Very real; characters are well developed.  Funny, touching...it's all in there.  Again, fashion and technology of that era are amusing, but who cares when the story is well written?",1367625600,,181,5.206896551724138
3959724,5,B002NN7EXS,This series is timeless the issues that the friends deal with are as current today as they were 20 years ago. The characters are complete flawed people like all of us.  There is humor and pathos.  Great Series. Start with the first year to get the most  out of the series. It is also fun to look at the clothes and hair of the period.,1362787200,,334,4.107692307692307
3959725,5,B002NN7EXS,This took me back to the good ol' days! They don't make shows like this anymore. :) Definitely worth your time.,1360454400,,111,4.333333333333333
3959726,5,B002NN7EXS,"This is a great collection. The writers and producers give quite a bit of air time to Ellen's backstories, as well as to the relationship between Gary and Melissa. The actress who plays Susannah delivers some of the best performances, as does Timothy Busfield. (I'll never quite understand how Mel Harris landed the role of Hope--she's a horrible actress, and her chemistry with the rest of the group borders on awkward. It never improves throughout the course of the series, either.) It was enjoyable re-visiting the 80's fashions and saxaphone/electric guitar music, lol--however, the writers got it wrong with single/married relationships. It was unrealistic to see Hope and Michael being so ""open door"" with all of their single friends, especially being in their 30's. I know of NO married couples in their 30's who allow their single friends over so much. To the contrary, they are very protective of their time. My husband and I have been married 18 years--without kids--and it's practically impossible to gain entrance into these family units--it just does not happen. Child-free couples basically hang with other child-free couples or siblings, families with kids hang with families with kids, and singles hang with singles. I suppose the writers put all of these characters together to represent a cross-section, as well as to gain a broader television audience. Either way, this DVD is worth purchasing over 2 decades later. The stories still apply.",1359676800,,1459,5.186440677966102
3959727,5,B002NN7EXS,"Really enjoying this series very much. I love how it is written and directed. I was thirtysomething when it came out and never got a chance to see the entire series for one reason or another. With amazon prime I am able to stream the episodes and watch them whenever I want, I would someday like to buy the whole set. I can definitely relate to the characters and situations.",1351036800,,375,4.371428571428571
3959728,5,B002NN7EXS,"The ""thirtysomething"" folks during the 1980's, aka (Baby Boomers), are probably the greatest generation we have ever had... They greatly outnumber the generation I am in called simple generation ""X"" being born towards the end of 1967.. I missed out on the flower power, The Beatles, even knowing much about what was going on with the war over in Vietnam.  The Baby Boomers brought my generation MTV, and about every modern invention that we have right now..  This show sheds light on the greatest generation... Thirtysomething tv series makes you forget you are watching actors, who are reading lines written by writers... These actors are acting from their hearts, and therefore it speaks to all of our hearts...  You believe every word this great ensemble cast says.  You feel their pain, and their joy.  I truly think this is the greatest series ever produced.. and I'm a fan of both the Dick Van Dyke show and the Mary Tyler Moore show and the Waltons.  The thirtysomething cast will always remain thirtysomething to us..  Although now they are close to 60 something.. Who would think that 25 years after this show began, we would be watching the entire series on DVD's and writing about it on amazon.com  ..  Life was grand in the 1980's.. and this series captures all of it.  To paraphrase Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America, if Seinfield is the show about nothing, than thirtysomething is the show about everything.  They had the perfect cast, the perfect everything.  Why isn't the cast and show honored on the Tvland awards, for a groundbreaking series.. It surely was and is...",1335744000,,1589,4.844444444444444
3959729,5,B002NN7EXS,"I used to watch Thirtysomething on TV when it was a new, ongoing series. Back then, I was the age of all the show's adult characters and could relate to their issues, enjoying the episodes and the honesty with which they were presented. Now, I just completed watching the entire DVD set of Season One. I had bought it so as to share with my now grown daughter. Both of us loved watching the show! I enjoyed it because it was a flashback to me of the years ago when I first watched the series, and I still liked it now. The characters are real, their problems are real and ones you can truly identify with (not some flimsy TV problems that one could never imagine happening in real life) and most of all, my daughter could relate to them as well - and that's something when you bring back a series from a couple decades ago and it still has the same strong appeal for today's young adults as it did when it was originally broadcast.

There is a mixture of all kinds of REAL characters in Thirtysomething. You've got the struggling couples (Michael and Hope who are happy but still deal with marriage issues; Nancy and Elliot who separate), infidelity, quirky Melissa, finicky Ellyn, continuous relationship flaws and fears of not finding ""the"" one for Ellyn and Melissa as well as Gary from the male perspective. Issues of parenthood and career - you name it, they address it. The time period may be a couple decades off, but the problems are unique yet the same as we're dealing with today.

I can't wait to continue with Season Two and onward!  I recommend this series highly.",1316131200,,1577,4.487804878048781
3959730,5,B002NN7EXS,"I have been looking for years to find ThirtySomething on DVD...It was such a huge part of growing up in the 80's...The quality of the DVD is excellent and every season is available so you can buy them all, wait for a snow storm and hunker down to relive and laugh at how self indulgent we were in the 80's...

PS:  To see the 80's clothes alone is worth the money, you will smile fondly when you see the size of the shoulder pads!",1314748800,,430,4.107142857142857
3959731,5,B002NN7EXS,"I was glued to my TV for a week watching this DVD. I always enjoyed the show when on network TV but was so happy to be able to watch it again along with the comments and special features!! I think this show was highly Under-rated when on TV and after watching it again I realized what a very special show it was. They just don't make TV like this anymore-it feels like you are watching a mini-movie each episode and the way the shows were filmed makes it so much more ""artful"" than today's TV.  Some of the episodes are better than others but that can be said about any TV show. The topics were relevant to that era and I think still are relevant to couples and mothers today. Watching these shows takes me back to when I was a young mother with two kids and all the anquish,stress and joy involved in trying to balance raising kids and still being a good spouse and trying to be a contributing member of the ""real world"" at the same time. It makes me understand my own ""thirtysomething"" experience a little better.",1297209600,,1015,4.286458333333333

3959741,1,B002NN7EXS,"That thirtysomething is finally out on DVD (after almost 20 years!) is the answer to one of my most fervent prayers. Or it would be.

Because the DVD is a letdown.

As with the first season DVDs, the technical quality of the remastering wavers considerably. There are entire portions that simply were not remastered at all. It's often one camera track, while the other camera track in the same scene has been remastered. So one moment you're watching a reasonably high resolution DVD, the next moment (cut to the other camera), it's TV and VHS tapes all over again: fuzzy contours, awful colors. And then back to the high resolution. And back to VHS. That quickly. It makes you dizzy. And mad.

In the second season, it gets increasingly worse - as if Shout Factory (the DVD manufacturer) had been running out of money, or time, or just not felt like doing it any longer. The worst episode I've seen to date is ""Michael writes a story""  (2nd season, # 13). About half of the entire episode is simply not remastered at all. Or only the actors but not the background. Then they cut to the second camera and it's o.k. again.

Btw, the closed captions are sloppy too. That out in La-La-Land, they don't know what ""Ardmore"" is may be all right, but there IS a difference between saying ""I'm scared"" and ""I'm sorry."" In short: bad job, Shout Factory!",1267920000,23,1344,4.560165975103734
3959742,5,B002NN7EXS,"I am new to Thirtysomething because I was too young to really appreciate it when it originally aired on TV.  But on the recommendation of a very good friend (who had watched the entire series when it first aired) I watched the first season and was instantly hooked!  It has a very good group of actors and some very interesting storylines.  If you like continuing drama television like I do (I am a huge Dallas and Knots Landing fan), you will like this show.  It is very different from those other shows in that the characters are not rich- they are middle class, average Joe's like most of us trying to make it in a tough world.  It showcases their personal lives as well as their work lives and the daily struggles we all have.  And since I didn't watch it first run, it is like a whole new show to me, and even though the fashions and some of the issues are out of date now, I am thoroughly enjoying a flashback to a time when I was younger. It is a very entertaining show and I hope the entire series is released!",1267315200,,1018,4.221649484536083

This series is by far the most honest look at human relationships I think I've ever seen. The cast is superb, well acted throughout. The only thing dated about it is the lack of cell phones! A brilliant study of human relationships in very real situations. Family and friendship are the key elements. Classy, dramatic, lots of witty lines, just amazing. I was really upset that Season 2 was so short so now I have to wait for Season 3. Back to re-runs for now!!!",1265673600,2,587,4.25
3959749,5,B002NN7EXS,"I love this series, but this season they really took it up notch above the first season. So many good episodes here. Really good new characters introduced like Miles and Susannah. Miles may be my favorite character...he's definitely my favorite villain.

Because I'm a business guy...I loved the episodes featuring the battles between Miles, Micheal and Elliot.

One of my favorite things about the series is...they weren't afraid to tell each other when they felt the other was wrong. I loved that...honesty. It wasn't honesty simply for honest sake...but out of concern and caring. Sometimes it tested their friendships, but it made their relationships better. Stronger. They became better people as a result.

If friendships and family mean alot to you...tune this series in.

3959752,3,B002NN7EXS,"I just received this DVD set.  The commentaries are interesting and insightful, and it's great to see the uncut episodes for the first time in over twenty years.  I have only watched one of the discs, but have found what I consider to be a big production problem.  On Disc 1, episode 2 ""In Re: The Marriage of Weston"", the scenes have been edited out of order. It's very obvious, but to be certain I compared the DVD with a copied episode from ""Lifetime"".  Two sequences stand out.  On the DVD, early on Hope and Ellyn giggle about the instructor at the art center and Hope intimates he and Nancy have slept together.  However, the scene where Nancy gets the art center job and meets the instructor comes later in the DVD.  Likewise, there is a scene where Nancy angrily confronts Elliot about contacting a Realtor to sell the house, and rips him for instructing Ethan not to tell her.  The scene in the DVD where Elliot is showing the Realtor the house and admonishing Ethan not to tell his mother comes after this scene.

The DVDs are beautiful.  I would have given the set 5 stars if not for the production problem",1264118400,35,1117,4.458128078817734

Recurring, complex characters, Miles Drentell and Susanna Hart, were introduced. Episodes came to rely less on plot, allowing viewers opportunity for introspection, a strength of the series that became one of its hallmarks.  Although bonus features are not as abundant as on the season one package, the three included here (profiles of Miles and Susannah, and a feature ""W.G. Snuffy Walden and the Music of thirtysomething"") are individually substantive, expanding one's appreciation for the season and providing grace notes for the series overall.",1263945600,6,747,5.495652173913044

8375218,3,B002NN7EXS,"This boxed set is magnificent in every respect save one: there are no subtitles. If there were, this would be a five-star review. All the comprehensive bonus materials are fabulous, and if the filmmakers care enough to make them part of the package, they should care enough to provide subtitles. Although the recording of voices is, with rare exception, extremely fine and clear, some essential words of dialogue cannot be understood except by lip readers; but if the camera is pointed at someone other than the speaker, even lip readers cant get them. Sometimes, if two actors are speaking at the same time, you cant tell what either of them is saying. Other times, a slammed door or a pot dropped in the sink will obliterate an important word or phrase. Crying babies often can obliterate something of significance that youd really like to hear--as can the occasional loud music.

Thirtysomething was a brilliant series when it first appeared. And it holds up very well indeed. It was the first TV series that really explored human character in all its subtleties and complexity. It will make you laugh and cry and, more than anything else, think. It presents human nature in the round, in all its glittering, bright and dark facets. Its a series you shouldnt miss.",1511740800,,1267,4.838709677419355
