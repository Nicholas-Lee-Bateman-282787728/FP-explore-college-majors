3038754,5,B000Z7OTFU,"I have purchased this entire series from Amazon, and they are all great! The tranfer to DVD gives you a crystal clear picture and better sound than the ones that were in the VHS format.
  There are lots of chapters so you can go to the next scene or next film since there are a couple of seperate movies on each DVD.
  No matter which DVD you pick you can't go wrong with this series but I guess I am alittle biased towards this one ""Big Game America"" since my father was the QB for the Pottstown Firebirds and I appeared in this one myself.
  NFL Films did a great job putting their Lost Treasure films on these DVD's. If you buy the box set it will take you days to see all the films.",1205884800,6,686,4.044444444444444

8235030,2,B000Z7OTFU,"There were many great teams but Dallas Cowboys are not the first team that comes to mind .Yes they were good and some of their players were great but there many great teams and players. The Miami Dolphins with Kick, Griese, And Don Sulla were great . So were the Colts with Unitas and Green Bay with Barr Starr.",1371168000,,311,4.288135593220339
8235031,1,B000Z7OTFU,"I own the original Big Game America on VCR.  Either this DVD was damaged, or NFL films significantly edited the original version.  Significant parts of the show are not present.  Very unhappy.",1360886400,2,192,4.9375
8235032,5,B000Z7OTFU,"I bought this simply for the NFL Films special on the Pottstown Firebirds from the early 70's.  If you haven't seen this documentary, it's a must-see for all football fans.  It's not listed on Amazon, or anywhere on the packaging, but it IS a part of this disc.  I'm SO GLAD I found this.  Thanks to the review from Jimmy Corcoran Jr, ""The King""'s son, who alerted us all that this documentary was part of this package.  Excellent!!",1307577600,5,432,4.487179487179487
