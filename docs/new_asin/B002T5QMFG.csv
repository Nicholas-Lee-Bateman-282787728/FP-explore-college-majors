3984003,3,B002T5QMFG,"Although this was probably my fault for not looking closer at the listing, I assumed (Incorrectly) that because I was buying from what I thought was an American supplier that the DVD was for USA viewing.  It was fulfilled from a supplier in England which of course was sent as a Region 2 DVD which I could not play on my DVD.

I did not open the DVD when I realized this problem and did contact the supplier in England.  They would have been glad to refund the purchase price, but the cost to send it back to England was more than the purchase price, so it made no sense to send the DVD back.

Any American purchasers who cannot play a Region 2 DVD should not purchase this item.",1395100800,20,679,4.2

Hot Toasty Rag, July 25, 2017

James Wilby, fresh from a painful divorce, returns to his childhood home to visit his ailing mother, and to persuade her to sell the estate before she dies. When he arrives, he finds a young man, Jamie Dornan, has been keeping his mother company. Even though we know nor learn anything about him, Dornan becomes a fixture in each member of the familys life.

Jean Simmons plays the ailing grandmother. Its pretty sad to see her so frail, since she died the following year of lung cancer. The rest of the movie flounders about in the general vicinity of depression. Wilby is an absent father, Simmons is treated with disrespect, and both grandchildren are troubled and long for guidance. Unlike other dysfunctional family movies, theres nothing particularly devastating about their problems, which makes for a more realistic but less interesting story. Unless you really like these types of depressing movies, Id skip this one.",1500940800,,986,4.933734939759036
