3145305,5,B0015IVB9K,"This DVD was my first exposer to the raw food lifestyle.  I met Ken at a seminar last year and was overwhelmed by his knowledge of the subject of natural health and raw food.  I new nothing at the time, but was in the process of reinventing myself and he showed up at the right moment.  After the seminar I contacted Ken and asked him to recommend some books that I could study to learn more about eating raw food and preparing it.  He recommended a number of books and his DVD.  I bought it as well as the books and after going through them all, I found that being able to see him prepare the food was more helpful than just reading about it.  He also shares a plethora of information with you in the video while he is preparing the dishes.  My favorite recipe is Ken's Green Drink.  I found the booklet helpful in the kitchen since I could not watch the DVD and prepare recipes at the same time.  Since that time I have purchased another Raw Food DVD by a prominent chef and found that it did not stand up to the caliber set by Ken.  I would recomend this DVD to anybody interested in a raw living food lifestyle whether they are vetrans or just begining.",1204848000,17,1157,4.1945701357466065

8258788,3,B0015IVB9K,"The dvd's are alittle slow.  Dvd #1, there is a clip w/a friend of Ken Rohla's that is very corny and unnecessary. I also feel its unnecessary to show how to clean a juicer. You can learn that from your juicer's instruction manual. That was a waste of dvd space.
Overall the dvd's I might be okay for the person who doesn't know anything about raw food. But the dvd's instruction could use improvement. I didn't find them very inspiring.",1306800000,2,437,4.4625
8258789,5,B0015IVB9K,"If your looking for more information on how to prepare and eat ""raw food"" then this is your book.  I especially like that he does not go into the usually long winded speach on how ""raw food"" is the only way to eat.  I don't want to be told what to do.  I just wanted more information on the subject matter and this set provided that information.",1285718400,4,345,4.119402985074627
8258790,5,B0015IVB9K,"Ken Rohla's Fresh and Alive! 2-DVD set plus food combining chart and booklet offers a very generous number of superb recipes, clear instruction, and first rate insights about eating raw. I like Ken's easy going, informal style. His guidance on sprouting and the food combining chart are very helpful. This package is one of the best values I've found among raw DVDs.",1262908800,4,366,4.919354838709677
