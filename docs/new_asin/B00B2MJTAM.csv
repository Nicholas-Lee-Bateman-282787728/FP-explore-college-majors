8561535,5,B00B2MJTAM,A trip down memory lane for those of us who grew up in the Barry Richards era of DC music.  Too bad Pentagram did not get to play on the show (as scheduled).  The Alice Cooper cuts are worthwhile.  The Crow footage is an abomination.,1507334400,,233,4.133333333333334
8561536,4,B00B2MJTAM,Great DVD seeing this rare old footage from early 70's. Will be a volume 2. I remember seeing Bang perform on his show in the fall of 1972,1505606400,,138,3.9642857142857144
8561537,5,B00B2MJTAM,".....where has this been all my life!  In this collection, we get to witness Tommy Bolin laying the smack-down on a Les Paul while the rest of the band do its best to keep up musically. Then we get to see Alice Cooper freak us all out with his wild and wholly gig. Then we get to see a VERY young Bob Seger play a beat up Gibson firebird without his trademark facial hair  yes,its like seeing Billy Gibbons without his beard). Then we see Fats Domino jam with the Byrds and then we witness Muddy Waters and Rory Gallagher do it to it.......and that's just what's on the video portion.

I can't wait for a volume 2 where Black Sabbath rock the house and then Kiss try to burn in down.",1476921600,,683,4.159090909090909
8561538,5,B00B2MJTAM,"Back in the 60's and 70's in the DC,MD,VA area there was a music genius called Barry Richards...he was a cool DJ who came from radio and brought us great upcoming acts on his local music TV shows.  He was way ahead of his time as were some of the artists he presented to us.  Those artists, many who went on to be super rock stars are/were brought to us via Barry Richards and now are preserved for us to remember in this fantastic classic collection on DVD.  This collection is one of the best of it's kind taking us back to a time when music meant something.  This collection is a must have for anyone who was a musi-holic or even one who just enjoyed great rock music. The quality is superb. Don't pass this one up...hopefully they'll do a volume 2.  Can't wait.",1370304000,,765,4.248275862068965
8561539,5,B00B2MJTAM,"I obtained this DVD when it first came out.  Barry Richards was a DJ in the Washington DC area who hosted a free form television show in the late 60's,early 70's which let artists play their music live, often extended versions of songs.  There are definitely some great performances on this DVD.  Alice Cooper doing "" Eighteen"" and ""Black Juju"" and Zephyr doing ""St. James Infirmary"" are my favorites.  Both put on smoking performances.
There are many other great performances such as classic Humble Pie.
Barry goes over to introduce the band members.  He approaches the guitar player and says ""what's your name?""  The answer: "" Peter...Peter Frampton"".  They play a blistering version of ""Rollin Stone"".
Another great scene:  Fats Domino backed by the Byrds.  During the break after playing a few songs, Fats asks if the taping has stopped. After being assured it has been stopped, he gives McGuinn and another member directions on how to play the backing notes on ""Walking to New Orleans"". Takes 'em awhile to get it right. But they are respectful to the Fat Man (who doesn't know he's being taped) and they do it his way! When Fats starts the song for real they all nail it. Fats is in prime form here in 1970.
These are only a few of the great moments on this DVD.  The DVD is full of complete performances of great bands in their prime.  Highly recommended!",1359504000,3,1362,4.656903765690377
8561540,5,B00B2MJTAM,"Following a brief introduction from the golden-throated disc jockey himself, the Barry Richards TV Collection Vol. 1 DVD/CD set almost immediately immerses the viewer into a bygone world of rock and roll glory. The journey begins in 1968, where we find Richards hosting a charming show called Groove-In, interviewing high school kids in the crowd and introducing a performance from Cliff Nobles. Wholesomeness abounds, and it's a great contextual beginning for the DVD collection of Richards' Washington D.C. local access show moments--because those innocent vibes, those charming, well-kempt faces? Yeah, they don't last.

Two years later, 1970 finds Richards bearded--still with his radio voice on--cavorting with the likes of Richie Havens, Jamul (whose album I've added to my purchase list after watching the DVD) and, somehow appropriately Little Richard, who blazes through ""Good Golly Miss Molly"" like someone flipped a switch.

Everyone is stoned. Jamul plays in the woods. It's fantastic. The clothes are everything that anything that's ever been retro has been trying to duplicate, but the live performances are where it's at. Producer/director Eli Brown has the DVD organized so you can get right to the meat, and as 1971 comes around and an even mangier Richards plays host on a show called Turn-On to the likes of Humble Pie, Bob Seger System, Fats Domino (backed by The Byrds) and Alice Cooper--whose ""Black Juju"" might be the high point of the whole collection--you want to get down to business as quickly as possible.

Since it's local access footage from the `70s, some of the material is pretty raw, but Brown, who remastered the video himself, did an excellent job, and even the black and white clips of Crow and The Illusion have a certain charm. Likewise, one can't help but feel like they're watching a historical document as Muddy Waters nails ""Baby Please Don't Go"" and ""Got My Mojo Workin',"" which is some of the clearest (and scruffiest on Richards' part) video of all, shot in 1973.

The DVD has all kinds of bonus footage, from still galleries and interviews to the then-Vegas performer Iron Jaw Samson opening a Pepsi can with his teeth and eating a light bulb (even more disturbing than Alice Cooper), liner notes from Joe Hasselvander of Death Row and Raven, who was a fan at the time, and the CD plays out like a rsum of Richards' radio career, boasting interviews with The Beatles, Little Richard, Dr. John and live takes from Ace Trucking Company, Emitt Rhodes, and more. It's a classic and heavy rock treasure trove that has to be seen and heard to be believed--and for those of us mucking our way about the seedy underbelly of the music industry, an utter inspiration. Here's looking forward to Vol. 2.

8561541,5,B00B2MJTAM,This is one great DVD collection any rock music lover won't want to miss! Barry Richards' Rock Show was one of my favorite shows of all time. I've been waiting for anything to surface on DVD from this series. Highly recommended!,1359331200,,228,4.585365853658536
8561542,5,B00B2MJTAM,"Barry Richards, a local Philly guy, in the same musical ""neighborhood"" as the Geator with the Heator, Jerry Blavat, and the Great Gus Gossert from across the Hudson, has finally issued his '60's-'70s TV and radio telecasts and broadcasts to the special delight of those who heard him way back when...and have wondered ever since...wouldn't it be great if that Little Richard appearance with Jamal came out on tape?

We get Richard, Fats, Muddy, Havens, Alice, all at their fightin' weights ....on and on. No spoiler here. Check it out.....to the cart! :)

I bought three.",1359331200,,571,4.9375
