7983120,4,B00008G8S0,"Platinum's TV Classics edition of the classic western series BONANZA is a true must-have for any fan of this landmark series!! In Volume Three of this edition,originally part of a two-disc DVD set that's on sale at Wal-Mart for $5.88!!,the following episodes include BADGE WITHOUT HONOR (9/24/60),THE BLOOD LINE (12/31/60),THE COURTSHIP (1/7/61),and DEATH AT DAWN (4/30/60).BADGE WITHOUT HONOR involves an escaped killer,who poses as the local sheriff,who searches Jason Blaine,a married man of the bride,who is a friend of the Cartwright family,who comes to take him back while he's the star witness in the murder trial of the Murdock Gang. In THE BLOOD LINE,directed by film and TV veteran Lewis Allen,Ben Cartwright accidentally kills a man in self-defense. But when the victim's son returns home,he wants to kill Ben! Next up,THE COURTSHIP has Hoss falling in love with the new woman in town (Julie Adams of ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" fame).And finally,DEATH AT DAWN,the last episode of the first season,sees The Cartwrights and the local Sheriff involved in a murder innocent in which they hunt down the killer until the killer's hit man comes to destroy Virginia City and its people. These are exciting and enjoyable episodes of TV's longest-running western series,second close to GUNSMOKE!!! Platinum did an amazing job remastering both the picture and sound and even though this DVD doesn't contain the original theme music (since these shows are in the public domain and for copyright reasons),they used an orchestral version of ""Return To The Ponderosa"" as its opening theme which is great to listen to as it opens up the series!!! This is perhaps the best collection of BONANZA episodes out there that are in public domain and it's well worth the price!!! Check out my review for Volume Four of the series!!! Thank you Platinum for preserving this great and classic series on DVD!!!",1087516800,19,1899,5.148867313915858
