Luke Novac (Jason Blicker), a hockey player, is a high school student in Ontario, Canada. His mom and dad are divorced. His dad is a mining engineer and receives a two-year assignment to a project in Zimbabwe, East Africa. He promises to send for his son once he is settled. Later, Luke arrives in Africa hoping to see his dad at the airport to greet him. But his dad is involved in a mining accident on the site, so Luke is instead met by Thembe (Pedzisai Sithole) and a supervisor from the mine. Instantly, due to circumstances arising from the travel to the mine, Luke is instantly thrown into the local African culture. His own culture soon clashes with that of his new-found friend and 'brother' Thembe; these clashes test the bonds of their friendship.

This motion picture is visually stunning, the music is mesmerizing, and all the characters are just wonderful. This seemed more like a documentary than a scripted film to me. The friendship that develops between Thembe and Luke is something very beautiful to watch. Luke and Tulani's (Thembe's sister) relationship is innocent and captivating at the same time. I wish it could have materialized more than what is shown on screen. Disease, danger, and death play parts in this saga, yet the film is humourous at times, insightful and extremely uplifting!

There are so many lessons to be taken after viewing this master work. Both young men had a lot to learn from one another. Just because you have does not necessarily mean you always get, and just because you have not doesn't mean you will always do without. When we look beyond color and class there is something deep inside that we can treasure from one another.

My favorite line: ""I respect you, brother, but I must live my life.""",1286236800,,1996,4.661931818181818
8460739,5,6304771037,"I just had to say that my sister and I watched this movie about ten million times when we were young and we loved it every time.  We watched it again recently and it was even better than we remembered.  Temba and Tulani  rock my world and Jason Blicker puts in a solid performance as Luke Novak,  from Canada.  This film explores the issues that Luke (Jason Blicker), a  young canadian, experiences when he is sent to Africa for the summer to  visit his dad.  This film touches on themes such as divorce, collapsing  mine shafts, poachers who strand Luke and Temba in a tree, fun with dirt  bikes, and getting in trouble for having repeated crushes on Tulani.  For  all those A.J. fans out there, I have one thing to say, and one thing only:  ""You have to learn to shake, like an African.""",950054400,9,789,4.358620689655172
