8380657,4,B002TV20LK,"Great concert! I especially liked that Jorge Luis, one of the vocalists, seems to be very drunk, lol!  The only downside is that it's only 10 songs, so it's short.  If you like La Arrolladora, definitely buy this DVD.

Excelente concierto! Me encant que el Jorge Luis, uno de los vocalistas, parece estar bien pedo, jaja! Le agrega un no-s-qu.  Lo nico es que se me hizo corto: slo 10 canciones.  Pero definitivamente, si les gusta La Arrolladora, es muy buena compra.",1318464000,,485,4.783132530120482
