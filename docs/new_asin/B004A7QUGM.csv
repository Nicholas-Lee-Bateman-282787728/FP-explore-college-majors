8419594,5,B004A7QUGM,an unusually witty comedy  about a failing screenwriter who is in a state of total paranoia. Woody Allen could have invented a moody character like Luciano In the end he breaks the shell in  the  incredible disco-scene. This is no longer the moody off-beat character. And all this transformation is done in one short dance number. Daniel Hendler is surely one of the most talented Argentinian actors  .What a performance!!!,1438992000,,423,5.0
8419595,1,B004A7QUGM,"I stopped this film after an hour or so, finding it somewhere between frustrating and unbearable. The film revolves around a character named Luciano, who does not demonstrate a single feature that is interesting, endearing or admirable. Withdrawn, fearful and painfully awkward, I have a hard time imagining how the writers or director thought that an audience would develop any interest in Luciano - and he is called upon to carry the movie. There was nothing about this film that drew me in or held my attention, the action (and I use the term 'action' advisedly, being nothing more than a series of vaguely awkward scenes) moves at a glacial pace, and when I realized there was no ending that might be surprising or interesting to me, I turned it off.",1427760000,,754,4.763358778625954
8419596,3,B004A7QUGM,"'The Paranoids' is an indie film from Argentina about two friends who are scriptwriters. Luciano is extremely passive and fearful, and is struggling both socially and professionally, while Manuel is a more aggressive and typically 'successful' guy. It is a source of tension that the latter one has created a TV series based on the former one, without first consulting with him. But it is an attractive girl, named Sofia, who most affects the dynamics of their friendship. This is one of those stories where the audience find themselves rooting for the underdog.

The film is fairly watchable, although it could use a little more subtlety and character development (especially for Manuel and Sofia). The photography is nice and the soundtrack is a very cool collection of rock and electronic music, likely from Argentina. 'The Paranoids' reminds me a bit of 'Reality Bites', which has a similarly hip, MTV feeling, only this one has a distinct Latin American urban flavor.",1308787200,3,972,5.075
