6291174,5,B00IT3KQWM,The fact that this bluray is being preordered when the eps haven`t even aired and cover art isn`t even said to be out is mind blowing. Guys this is the real deal the doctor is real.,1398902400,16,181,4.055555555555555
6291175,4,B00IT3KQWM,"Full disclaimer, I like Doctor Who, this review is based on Amazon's Product advertising.

Why is Amazon pushing this to my Email consistently.  This isn't the first time I've gotten an email to buy a season that hasn't even aired yet.  It must be a really good season if people are already getting ready for the blu ray release.  Now maybe the blu rays will come out sooner and we get the blu rays before the episodes actually air.  If that happens, I will increase my star rating to 5 and buy this set.  Until then, Amazon, stop with this selling of Season 8.  We have a long time to wait before these sets actually do become a reality.",1398816000,6,638,4.310924369747899
6291176,5,B00IT3KQWM,"You must buy this season of discs. I mean, can we ever forget the powerful magnitude of Peter Capaldi's debut series? I think not.

Remember what happened in Episode 4? Oh, man. I'm not even gonna spoil it for all of you newbies out there. And when Episode 7 ended, I cried, probably worse than I did at the end of ""Time of the Doctor."" Such quality.

Said plainly, Peter Capaldi is the best Doctor to ever take on the role. He's brilliant, mysterious, and who knew he was such a laugh riot? I know. Me neither. He makes the other Doctors bow before his sheer gravitas. And thank you, thank you, thank you, for adding Samuel Anderson as a companion. Wasn't he flipping amazing? And the scenes he has with Jenna Coleman were to die for, weren't they?

Seriously. Why are you still reading this? Click pre-order now before Series 9 begins. You will not be sorry.",1398384000,49,860,4.430379746835443
6291177,1,B00IT3KQWM,As a rule I don' t buy or preorder something a haven't seen fully or partially. this is not an acceptation. I will have a little problem adapting to a Doctor who was saved by a Doctor in Pompeii.,1398211200,7,195,4.0256410256410255
6291178,5,B00IT3KQWM,"Does the BBC always do this?

Matt's last episode before his Goodbye was 5-16-13.  Six months later we got the two-parter Goodbye episodes 11-23 and 12-25-13 (mini Episodes don't count).  Its already almost a year since the last Series episode and who knows when we'll get the first episode of Series 8.

And to top-off all that long wait-time - the BBC advertises the new Series Collection on Blu-Ray before the First Episode's even been aired.

I understand we get 13 episodes starting sometime this year... Consecutively!  Definitely a good thing.  And the neo Doc is an old guy like me.  Very cool!",1397174400,9,602,4.776699029126213
6291179,5,B00IT3KQWM,"I have got to really wonder on this one.  Have they completed the filming and editing of the full season (series 8) before the show airs?  If we pre-order it, will we need to wait till all the episodes air before we get the discs?  This is really odd.  But I will be sure to buy it, but probably not till it is actually released... whenever that may actually be.",1397174400,5,362,4.128571428571429
6291180,3,B00IT3KQWM,"I always avoid individual disc releases of episodes because they usually end up in a set anyway. As such, I will be quite annoyed if this set doesn't include 'Day of the Doctor' and 'Time of the Doctor'.

Someone told me that they most likely won't be included as they didn't star Peter Capaldi where as all the other sets may have contained a Christmas special, but it was always consistent with the same star as Doctor in the series episodes. That may be true, but Capaldi did make his first appearance as the Doctor in 'Day' (even if it was only his eyes), and we saw him get regenerated into in 'Time' so he does have a presence in both of those episode.

But in any event....I'll be annoyed if I need to go back and buy the individual releases of those two episodes and suddenly have these two weird out-of-place looking single discs in between seasons 7 and 8 on my DVD shelf.

Do you hear me, BBC??? Include 'Day of the Doctor' and 'Time of the Doctor' with this set !!!",1397174400,7,977,4.298913043478261
6291181,5,B00IT3KQWM,"The season hasn't even started! There's already pre-orders? I love Doctor Who, hence the 5-star review, but that's insane.

Now! I'm expecting it to basically have the same contents as every other ""complete season"" of Doctor Who so far.
Obviously this is guesswork, but hey, if Amazon can publish Pre-Orders before we get so much as a trailer, then I can write a review for said product.",1397174400,10,387,4.776119402985074

6291188,5,B00IT3KQWM,"I love all the Doctor Who series from David on.  In this eleventh season some episodes are weak, as if Moffat is running out of ideas, and then there will suddenly be a truly great one. I didn't think I would like Peter Capaldi, and now I simply love him. He has brilliantly added comedy and darkness to my favorite sci-fi hero, and brings up the level of even the worst episodes with his energy, talent, and intelligence. I also thought Pearl Mackie, who plays the part of Bill, was superb. I'm sorry to see Capaldi go, but looking forward to the next season and the new female Doctor, which I hope Amazon will make available ASAP.",1513814400,5,632,4.401709401709402

6291196,4,B00IT3KQWM,"There were hits and misses this season, but overall, it was somewhat enjoyable. Episodes ""Time Heist"" ""Mummy on the Orient Express"" and ""Flatline"" were especially interesting to watch. Warning: Spoilers ahead.

I still don't like Clara (character), Jenna's a pretty good actress. For the longest time, I didn't like Clara and I couldn't put a finger on why. I thought it must be the transition from Amy Pond and Rory (Love them both so much!) to Clara, and if I give Clara enough time, maybe she'd grow on me. It'd been 2 and a half seasons and she didn't (7.5, 8, and 9). Something is off about her and I finally figured out what's wrong with her. The show present Clara as a bubbly character who is nice and very sympathetic about everyone around her. But the more episodes I watch, I realized something very disturbing about her character. She is able to sympathize with people, but unable to empathize with them. At all. Sympathy and empathy are very different things. She can only see things from one perspective - hers, and she expects everyone else to see and feel like her or there is something with them. She forces her will and perspective on people by means of belittling, manipulation, guilt, or moral kidnapping. In ""Hide"" the doctor showed her the entire cycle of the earth and she gets upset that he doesn't feel the way she does after witnessing what happened, and she gets even more upset because the first thing that popped into her mind after witnessing such splendor was accusing the doctor of seeing them all as ghosts and nothing. In ""Listen"" she went up to the little boy's room for no reason at all and thought it was okay. When she was under the bed in the farmhouse, she accidentally grabbed the kid's ankle by accident, told him it was a dream and go back to sleep, and instead of leaving, she decided to pet his head and whispers into his ear as if something from under the bed grabbing your ankle in the middle of the night wasn't scary enough. Again, because from her point of view, she was comforting him, without considering the fact that her actions were terrifying him. ""In the forest of the night"" she made the decision that none of the kids will get to be saved by the Tardis because they will want their parents, will always want their parents so they should stay on earth and die with their parents (without asking anyone if they want to be saved or stay and die). In ""Dark Waters"", Her beloved boyfriend got into a car accident and passed away, an old lady said it was a terrible thing, she said ""It wasn't terrible. It's boring. It was ordinary."" Then said ""But I am owed...better. I am owed."" I understand shock and grief, but her boyfriend just die and she said it was too boring a death and that SHE is owed. Not Danny is owed. Another instant where her lack of empathy kick in was when she convinced a man to risk his life to get her cellphone back, caring very little about his safety. The more episodes I watch, clues are popping up all over the place point to companion Clara being a psychopath. And what is the one thing that a psychopath lacks? Empathy. Another thing that's annoying about Clara is that she tries too hard to become the doctor. Not sure why the writer makes this trait so pronounce in Clara. It would be interesting to find out one day.",1504137600,4,3302,4.4759535655058045

6291199,4,B00IT3KQWM,"Actually my name is Courtney Patricia Parsons, this is a family member's account but we all conduct biz through it. It is quite absurd and thinly veiled ageism, as well as requiring the kind of close-mindedness predictable of a troll, to hold Peter's age against him. The best reboot Dr.s have been, in order:

1. David Tennant, nuff sed

2. Chris Eccleston (whose reign was only short because he is a big star in Britain (and while a bit more minor here, you will find he is in many things you might not have realized he was in if you googled him. Further, he felt that every time he tried to make a suggestion, he was shot down before the suggestion was even finished by RTD in a snarky, ""I'm smarter than you"" supernerd fashion. I've seen RTD and he comes off that way, and I don't blame Chris, an international superstar, for quitting. You know, RTD and the entire staff wanted him from the start, but were afraid they wouldn't be able to get him, and almost didn't ask because of the optics if he had turned them down.

3. Capaldi, I hate to put him three, this is a VERY close race here, each could easily be my ""1"" at times, rotating the whole pyramid around.

4. Imagine a VAST, TIME-LORD SIZED INFINITE space and somewhere you can barely make out, crawling at the bottom, is Matt Smith, He was still wet behind the ears, and had quite a bit of trouble filling the shoes of the vast superstars before him. It was a matter of experience, and while he eventually came into his own, he never truly had the feel of a vastly knowledged Gallifreyan Time Lord.",1501372800,,1561,4.372413793103449

6291201,5,B00IT3KQWM,"Season 8 has the best stand-alone episodes in DW with Mummy on the Orient Express, Flatline, Listen. Both Capaldi and Coleman have the most challenging episodes to act out in DW and they do it incredibly well. The fun romps like Robots and Time Heist and Deep Breath are watchable multiple times. The Danny Pink arc may not be appealing to many viewers but is saved by the acting of Capaldi and Coleman and offer some incredible dramatic moments. The season also takes a sharp turn in distinguishing itself from the previous New Who eras and making itself the most unique season. Capaldi as the acerbic 12th Doctor but with an incredible heart who wears his alienness (and vulnerability) on his sleeve is the polar opposite of 11. Overall, most of the episodes have excellent writing, acting, and direction. Standout season in all ways.",1500940800,,836,4.8125
6291202,1,B00IT3KQWM,"Wow, could barely stomach this version of the Dr. Terrible didn't even make it 4 or 5episodes into, and ended up selling this crap to someone else, who wad pissed off as much as me and gave the disks to someone else after watching the first episode.. might as well not waste your time and stop watching after Matt.

The Master, or The Mistress aka Missy, has regenerated as a woman this time but that won't stop her from planning something nefarious for The Doctor and his sidekick Clara.  This is part two of series eight, a British sci fi show about a time traveler with a unique ship that is at least partly alive.  I would recommend at least watching series eight part one before this, but to really get into it try a few episodes from all seven previous ""new"" series and maybe a few bits from the older (1960's to 1980's) show of the same name.",1498089600,,671,4.25984251968504

It's an English show so if you hate English accents then maybe don't watch this.

I could tell how disappointed she might've been that her boyfriend regenerated into an old man. But holy crap Peter Capaldi can carry his own. Talk about a badass. Love love love his interpretation of the Doctor. Granted I'm only on episode 2 but hell I love it. I also like how Matt Smith phoned in. Honestly, the audience needed that. Great way to help the audience know it's going to be okay with this older, sterner doctor. I loved his scene where he said you're looking at me but don't see me. Damn Peter Capaldi why are you so good. Love his outfit too. Fits him lol. I can't wait to see the rest of the season. I feel for Clara though. I wish her and Eleven had one more season together so then she could've left at the same time as Eleven and then there could be a new companion with Twelve. Peter made a wise choice by having a no flirting rule. It would've been weird and creepy almost to see him flirting with Clara. I mean I want him to love her but not flirt with her lol. Would've almost seemed Lolita-like even though Clara is an adult. You get what I'm saying.  But all this aside, Peter Capaldi rocks it hard!!! Bravo!!!

So while I think Season 8 is a little weaker than most of the other seasons since the 2005 reboot, for the most part it's still pretty darn good. To skip it would be like refusing to eat in a 4 star restaurant because you couldn't get into the 5 star. restaurant you were hoping for.

I've just seen the initial efforts so far, and enjoyed them immensely! Capaldi is an energetic force while also revealing shades of age and sadness alongside the manic surges.

6291294,5,B00IT3KQWM,"I have watched Dr. Who since I was in High School and PBS began to rebroadcast the third (John Pertwee) and fourth (Tom Baker) Doctors. That was nearly forty years ago. I have enjoyed very much the revival of Dr. Who with tremendously improved scripts, actors and production values compared to decades ago. I like Peter Capaldi but found the Clara character tiresome at times. Yet I am not prepared to give this season lower marks despite liking some of the prior seasons better. I would have liked the Danny character to be friendlier with the Doctor, too. ;) Something so well loved is a little more textured and nuanced by the rough edges and contretemps.",1485216000,,658,4.681034482758621

The previous Doctor was more whimsical and Clara's personality did not complement it very well.  I assumed this was going to be a problem with the new Doctor but it was not.  They are a great match.

This Doctor is much harsher than the last Doctor and Clara's personality is a great compliment to his abrupt and rude manner.  Once I got into the season I really enjoyed it and watch the entire season as fast as I could.",1485129600,,551,4.362745098039215

6291402,4,B00IT3KQWM,"New Doctor intros can be rough going. This season is no different. It doesn't begin to gel until half way through. Even then, I think they took this is some weird directions that don't always work. And the mystery/reveal on the season's arc was just a bit of a groaner for me.

Still, we have the brilliant Capaldi exploring the nooks and crannies of the character and finding his take on it. Combining his acting talents and love of the show, Capaldi is also able to throw in more subtle callbacks to other Doctors than we've ever seen. All of this makes it worth watching.

Previous actors were actually around the same age when they were cast and the first of the younger regeneration wasn't until Peter Davison. The right actor for that particular regeneration may not be a younger person, but what is needed for the adventure. In this case, the 12th Doctor is best portrayed by an Academy Award winner from Scotland.",1482710400,,445,4.868421052631579

6291434,3,B00IT3KQWM,This is the second half of Series 8 which follows the 12th doctor and Clara. You get the final 6 episodes of the season What I don't  get is amazon is expecting patrons to pay $24.96 for 6 episodes of doctor who. All the other Part 1 and Part 2 dvd's of Doctor who run for 10-17 dollars I don't get why this one hasn't gone down in price,1482192000,2,337,3.8840579710144927

(However, the 2-Part Ending dwelling on Clara and her boyfriend scenario is tiresome and worn out. She was always best as Traveling Companion, not girl-in-love plotlines that get on your nerves. Thankfully, the earlier Episodes make up for this lazy excuse for sidestepping writing better Episode plots.

6291446,3,B00IT3KQWM,"When I heard Peter Capaldi was going to be the next Doctor Who I was so excited. He has that quirky frenetic kind of energy the character warrants. What I got tho was a dry piece of toast. Very strict, humorless and oh so severe is this doctor. Clara with the introduction of Danny Pink as her boyfriend has been reduced to a complaining ungrateful spoiled appendage. She has to be talked into going on adventures with the Doctor. Really? There is no chemistry between the two. He seems mostly grumpy and impatient all the time. Insulting the human race.is this really the doctor we have grown to know and love? Hardly. It is clear they wished to change up the doctor companion relationship to a more platonic one. okay got that. They dug themselves into a hole with the elephant in the room boyfriend girlfriend thing. But this is an over reaction to do this to the character. This is a misuse of Capaldis talent. The costume makes me wish to choke.. A shirt buttoned to the very top feels like suffocation. Gone is the humor of the Doctor, bring back the Lizard lady and her wife. Bring back their butler. The stories are dry, unappealing and frankly boring. River Song has said her farewells also. If you take away something, busy God replace it with something better. Maybe the head writer is all dried up. Bad writing and no imagination are meant to counteract the brilliance od David Tenant and Matt Smith.
Disappointing",1481932800,,1426,4.596078431372549
6291447,5,B00IT3KQWM,"I mean, it's ""Doctor Who"". To a true diehard fan, it's brilliant.  First full season with Peter Capaldi as the Doctor, and I'll admit, I was quite skeptical about this recent regeneration.  It's always difficult to go through that, but I was particularly weary after having 2 GREAT actors (Matt Smith & David Tennant) playing the Doctor.  I mean this guy looks OLD, how can HE be energetic, quirky, or even have a hint of flirting with the female supporting characters?  But, after watching the full season, I will say that Peter has brought his own sense of flare and a whimsical flavor to the role.

All in all I loved it because it was ""Doctor Who"" I will say that even having seen the whole season, I still miss David Tennant, but that's part of being a Doctor Who fan.",1481932800,,773,4.453900709219858

I struggled with the transition to Peter Capaldi because he seems like the antithesis of Matt Smith in bearing and demeanor, yet the scripts sounded like they were written for the youthful enthusiasm and humor of Matt. On the plus side, the stories are typical Doctor Who fare and after a critical juncture between Capaldi and Jenna Coleman (Clara), the series seems to be on a better track. What allowed me to continue watching after the loss of Matt Smith was knowing that this too (Peter Capaldi) would pass.",1481587200,,582,4.660194174757281

Having seen several series with him has proven that to be spot on.  He is an alien and Capaldi plays the alien well with his uncertainty about humans and their ways.

I am not going to do a review on each story as there will always be some that you connect with better than others, but I liked the series and I think the story arc and Jenna's departure were handled well and a joy to watch.",1480809600,,553,4.101851851851852

But for long-time Whovians weaned on Who since the Sixties, Twelve is a wonderful return to the irascibility of a William Hartnell or Jon Pertwee. As with seasons past, some stories work better than others, but overall the season is well worth the viewing -- and the return of one of the Doctor's oldest foes (and I'm not talking about the Daleks) is a joy.",1479254400,,512,4.7
6291530,4,B00IT3KQWM,"A new Doctor is back for another season.  The doctor is played by Peter Capaldi, I imagine not the oldest person to be playing the doctor.  He is just as zany.  You never know what you are going to get from him.  Sometimes his tastes go to a style that went out decades ago, and then somethings he does is so very modern.  He has the same problem that the doctor from season one had: saying things without any compassion or empathy at all.  However, deep down he truly does care.  The lady playing Clair is in my opinion the prettiest traveling companion that he has had.  It seems that they have a good sized budget for the shows as well.",1479254400,,639,4.223140495867769

6291557,1,B00IT3KQWM,"I'm not the Whovian around here (daughters are) but I have watched ALL the shows and enjoy the entire cult.  But....this season seems to be all about Clara who supports a bumbling Doctor who has lost his mojo.  I use to love pretty Clara.  Now, ugh.  I've just started rewatching season 8 in hopes that I was just too critical of the new Doctor and missed Tenant and Smith too much, but it's not nostalgia that's killing my enthusiasm for this season.  Not my favorite at all.  I'm looking forward to the next few episodes when Clara if FINALLY off the show.  Hopefully the Doctor will recapture his genuine care and concern and love of life instead of the duty-bound pessimist that he seems to be so far.  I guess I'm enough of a Whovian to continue watching regardless.  I just know Captain Jack wouldn't like the new Doctor :(

**Update - Just finished watching Season 8 again.  What a terrible, terrible season.  Doctor Who is NOT what it use to be.  The Doctor is a useless, wimpy, unimaginative cry baby who is emotionally unstable.  The writing isn't able to make the viewer feel sympathetic.  Clara and her nauseating boyfriend, Danny take over as the Doctor, and even say as much.  Danny hates the Doctor and the Doctor takes his abuse and validates all his vicious accusations.  The epiphany, when it finally comes, is so diluted and impotent that it leaves you disappointed in having to waste so much time and hope in this season.  You can definitely tell that Moffat is on the way out and that all the writers have left for Sherlock.  I'll pass on Season 9 since the Whovians tell me that it's more of the same, at least for half the season.  The old Doctor is gone.  The new doctor is a panzy.  Fifty years, a legacy, just gone.  But hey, it's just a t.v. series.  Way to kill it, though.  I feel sorry for Peter Capaldi.  He got a dog of a part on this gig.  He won't be remembered kindly for this.",1478563200,,1912,4.404011461318052

6291571,2,B00IT3KQWM,"Can I rate the ratings system? I'm not a fan of 5 star ratings. It's not a 2 and it's not a 3, it's a 2 1/2.

Coming off of my favorite Doctor ever in Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and, it would soon become apparent, the writers had a hard act to follow. The Twelfth Doctor lost all the fun that Smith and Tennant had. To fill the void they up the anger and mean spiritedness that the previous Doctors had sometimes.

The initial episodes weren't just darker but they really slowed the pace of the show down. To make matters worse, they minimized the use of background music. Depending on the scene, this further darkened the mood or took away something that would've added to the mood.

I thought having Jenna Coleman remain on would smooth the transition but the writers chose to alter her character and her relationship with the Doctor. Again, taking away the fun and adding conflict, in-fighting and melodrama in it's place. It also seems at times like their past history is forgotten for the sake of melodrama. As an example, during the ""Mummy on the Orient Express"" episode, at the beginning, the Doctor comments on Clara's smile in a way that's just a downer and makes him completely unlikeable. Then he repeats the comment and they linger on it. I don't see the point of it.

I guess the positives are that Jenna Coleman gives some great performances even if some of the scenes don't ring true emotionally. The end of the season felt the most Doctor-y both in that it felt more fun but also, unfortunately, in how silly it got.

I'm hoping Season 9 is better.",1478217600,,1563,4.48943661971831

The first few episodes showed the Doctor as more prickly than we're used to, which made loving him harder, but the more you watch, the more interesting Peter Capaldi is at the Doctor. I love the shades!
If you are a Who fan, give him a few episodes to grow on you. If you're not a Who fan, starting with Capaldi will make an interesting comparison when you go back and look at older Doctors.

If you don't know what a Whovian is, then I would say this program is British humor and very nicely done science fiction that you can enjoy, though you would enjoy it much more if you were steeped in the series (and thus knew the Doctor regenerates in new bodies; that Daleks are the universe's most terrifying beings -- even though they apparently can be defeated by a simple set of stairs; and what a reference to a ""long scarf"" is).

The Doctor is having a hard time of it, too, as his prodigious memory is being filtered through another Senior Personality.  It has been a long time since he was ""old"" in appearance and although he has always been wise and venerable, his recent companions could join in with someone who at least appears to be a peer.  It is particularly hard for Clara, the Savior of the Doctor many times throughout history.  She is in a complicated relationship with a contemporary who is unaware of his past relationships with Clara.  He is totally accepting of everything that Clara tells him, but he demands honesty of her.  She is afraid of losing him but he tells her to ""Fear a little bit less. Trust a little bit more.""

6291660,4,B00IT3KQWM,Th 2005 Dr Who series in general has been great to watch.  The only reason I give this 4 stars is because beginning with Capaldi the show has become more and more politically oriented.  Obviously this isn't uncommon but some episodes in seasons 8 and 9 have been pretty much in your face with the condescending political rhetoric at times.  Other than that Capaldi does a great job and the show is just as entertaining as ever.,1476576000,,427,4.51948051948052

For example, in episode 1, a horrible danger is discovered.  Everyone is baffled as THE END looms ever larger.  When the alloted episode time is about to expire, the Doctor has a sudden inspiration and all is saved!!!

For episode 2, insert script from episode 1 here.

But he's an excellent, talented actor, and from his first episode he has held my interest and even compelled me emotionally. He joins a line of good actors who have brought their unique talents and personalities to the role. Not all have been as successful as others (and the last couple of Doctors in the first go-round of Doctor Who, starting in 1963, ended that series with a whimper and my cringes), but I am as engaged by Capaldi as I was with Tom Baker.

6291819,5,B00IT3KQWM,"What can one say here.. He's The Doctor.  He reminds me of a mix of William Hartnell, John Pertwee, and well what am I saying here?  He has done a wonderful job as Doc Who. I was very worried at first, as I did not like him at all in his previous role played during David Tenant's tenure as The Doctor, but it seems as though he was merely playing an unlikable sod in The Fires of Pompeii. (at least I think that was the name, if not it was similar)  Peter Capaldi seems to have taken a little something from each of the Doctors over the years, but for the most part he borrowed nothing from 3 of the 4 newer Doctors.  When angry, you can certainly see the John Hurt ""War Doctor"" style showing thru..
Season 8 had a couple of rocky episodes as Peter was getting his bearings on the role. Oddly enough it was not the first episode.. He was outstanding as a Doctor suffering from regeneration pains.

Bottom Line...... Peter Capaldi borrowed easily from the original 8 Doctors because he was a fan of the show coming up. Even so, it is obvious that, as he was a fan, he had also envisioned himself as Dr Who enough times for him to be able to bring about his own stylish way of doing things.
I hate one thing about Dr. Who universally from June 1963 until the present day.. I never want to see them go, and I always HOPE for those multi Doctor special episodes.. that are so few in number.  *touches a finger to the nose*  Who knows, If only they knew...

I believe this one episode in the whole garners the core of the new Doctor in a way no other episode has so far. It truly brings to light the honest and true relationship between the Doctor and his mandate to the universe as a Time Lord.

Spoiler Alert:

This right here folks is the core of the Doctor, his desire to preserve life in the universe, first mainly his human friends or Earth, but secondly all creatures living. He cannot resist the desire to save creatures who are endangered. We all know he will murder the last of species to save mankind, but he will also dispose of anyone who desires to murder the last of any species also.",1474156800,,672,4.36

Others were absolute crap, such as 'Kill the Moon' and 'In the Forest of the Night'.  It was also waaay too Clara-centric.  She was a terrific foil in the beginning, but has been far too overshadowing in this season.  And will all due respect to the acting talents of Michelle Gomez, they never should have made the Master female.  That's just Moffit's political views messing with things for PC brownie points.

As she has chosen to be the one to ""save the doctor"", she is more forthright in her demands and he is very reliant on her. Too bad Season 9 is not on Amazon Prime. Why not Amazon? I will certainly not be buying it. I'd rather rent it from the local video store if necessary.

Also, I had on-going buffering problems with season seven and eight of this program. Amazon was of no help technically. Too bad for them and us the viewers. Anyone else have this problem? It did not occur on any other Amazon program or on the other streams.",1472860800,,694,4.37984496124031

6291991,2,B00IT3KQWM,"I was surprised I would ever rate Doctor Who so low.  So let me clarify why I am now.  Peter Capaldi does a great job.  He IS a great combination of the first and third Doctor with his own fun added in.  Clara is fine, though she does get a little stale.  And the series starts quite well.  Magical actually.  I really liked it.

Then the third episode began.  As it goes on, it gets darker and darker, both in the mood, the script, AND how it's filmed.  (BBC, if you didn't have the budget for it, then spread the damn thing out until you DO!)  I laughed at first when I saw it was directed by Rachel Talalay.  I thought, ""Wow, she did some of the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels.  This should be good!""

I was wrong.  It had the same dark, dreary, ""bummer ending"" feel of the ""Freddy's Nightmares"" TV show in the early nineties.  When it reached the end, I was actually sick.  This is not Doctor Who.  Had I known what I was in store for by the time I reached the end, I would never had purchased season 9 (but I did).  Mr. Pink, you deserved better.  If you liked Season 7, end it there.  You won't just cry with this.  You'll be angry.  It's just... terrible.",1472688000,3,1167,4.111607142857143

6292051,3,B00IT3KQWM,"Unlikely as it sounds, the great show runner and writer Stephen Moffat seems to have not been informed that he is writing for a different lead actor. Season 8 is full of dialogue that would've been perfect coming out of Matt Smith's mouth. Capaldi, however, seems to still be playing Malcolm Tucker, although the swearing is replaced with neutron-flow reversing technobabble. They eventually find the right way to present Twelve, but it doesn't happen until season 9. The highlights of season 8 are few and dim: ""Listen"" had huge potential, but instead focused on establishing a secondary character's backstory (who ends up dying anyway) and ""Time Heist"" was a fun, energetic caper but had a few Deus-Ex-Machina moments that were difficult to believe. Overall, the season was an exercise in expensive mistakes, and it's hard to believe the show runners let it get this bad before righting the ship again (in spectacular fashion) in season 9. Skip the Robin Hood episode, and go straight to ""Dark Water"" and ""Death In Heaven"". Then you can watch season 9 with renewed appreciation for what Doctor Who really is about.",1470873600,,1116,4.973262032085562

6292090,5,B00IT3KQWM,"Doctor Who has always been a favorite of mine since the relaunch with Christopher  Eccleston.  I enjoyed the original show as well, even though the special effects were not that ""special.""  With any new Doctor, the critics are always a little tough.  I find, however, with having watched this one now a couple of times that Capaldi is one of the best Doctors yet.  He has the same quirks, with a little twist.  I know at some point they are going to address why ""that face"" and that ""age.""  They hint to it in this season.  Overall it is well done and leaves me wanting more.  I think the writing was diverse enough to have fun using both old and new elements.  It leaves me wanting more Doctor Who and more Capaldi.

He has enormous shoes to fill given the energy that Matt Smith put into the roll.  Not trying to be cruel, but I don't think there is any chemistry between he and Jenna Coleman.  I don't like the road the writers sent Clara down.  Her storyline and Capaldi's grouchy Doctor bring the show to it's lowest point since the most-hated episode, Love and Monsters.

6292206,3,B00IT3KQWM,"3 stars for anything else is average, for Doctor Who, it's ""rubbish"". First off, I really enjoyed Capaldi as The Doctor. He is one of the best, if not THE best aspects of series 8. The problems with series 8 begin with The Doctor's companion, Clara Oswald. It's not Jenna Coleman's fault though, she does a good job with what she's given. The issue is that she (and all the minor characters in the Steven Moffat Era for that matter) is given WAY too much to do. The Doctor often times takes a back seat in his own show, sometimes overlooking simple solutions to problems so that Clara can swoop in and save the day. This wouldn't be as much of a problem if Clara was a well written, three dimensional character but sadly, she's not. As the viewer, you never really connect with Clara or her boyfriend Danny Pink. Moffat's weaknesses as a show runner are no more apparent than with the characters he creates. Characters that always seem to fall into two distinct categories: Bland or Mary Sue. Madame Vastra? Mary Sue, Danny Pink? Bland, River Song? Mary Sue.
And so on....
At times, Moffat almost seems to be self-gratifying in the writing of these characters and won't stop shoving them down your throat until you think they're as amazing as he believes. ""Isn't Madame Vastra awesome? She's a Lizard woman living in Victorian London who eats criminals and solves crimes! Isn't she so unique and amazing?! Wow! Did you see that? She's so cool isn't she?"" I am constantly pulled out of the show by how hard it's trying to convince me how ""great"" it is now. What made the RTD Era so great were characters that you became emotionally invested in. And I found myself no more aware of this then when a character who appeared throughout the season, met a tragic end in the finale. In what should have been a gut-wrenching moment, I was actually angry with the show because I just didn't care about this character. I wanted to care, but I just didn't. I wanted to ball my eyes out, I wanted to have that same feeling I had when Rose's father sacrificed himself for her, or when Donna met her fate, or Rose got trapped in an alternate dimension or when ""he"" knocked four times... But nothing. Any sadness I did manage to feel was for my own lack of compassion for these characters.

So 3 stars because the stories are still good, I just don't care about the characters in them.

6292284,4,B00IT3KQWM,"Anytime a new Doctor regenerates, there is always an adjustment period, which should not be considered when rating the season, because it is a real part of this shows long history.
I began watching Doctor Who in 2005, with C. Eccleston as the Doctor - so my experience is limited to a three Doctors who were in a similar age range, and were energetic, vibrant and passionate.  This new Doctor is considerably older, and required a much bigger adjustment.  The first episode did a great job of having the current Companion, Clara, go through the same adjustment with the audience.  She didn't like it at first, and had trouble expressing why.  The reality is that this Doctor is not a young man with relationship potential.  He's more of a father-figure, and this takes quite some getting used to (on both sides of the TV Screen)
This new Doctor/Companion relationship develops and grows for both Clara and the audience, with some interesting storylines that contain lots of foreshadowing and historical references, as usual.  A new male character is introduced with relationship-potential for Clara, and the historically common storyline of keeping the Doctor a secret.  This all builds to an intriguing and heart-wrenching ending to the season.",1467849600,,1245,5.04390243902439

However, with the exception of two or three episodes, I found the stories for this season to be lacking.

I was a HUGE fan of Amelia Pond and actually grieved when her character interactions with The Doctor ended. But in true form Jenna Coleman as Clara is even cuter, brighter and wittier and holds her own with the indomitable Doctor. This season is revealing some of the Doctor's vulnerabilities and childhood secrets. He is becoming more human and relateable without seeming weak. He and Clara rattle off dialog so rapidly that I MUST have my subtitles turned on to completely absorb the sometimes subtle turning of a phrase. Also at times I need to Google an English phrase or two to understand the context completely.  Why can't the British just speak American??!! Ha Ha.",1466899200,,1003,4.731428571428571

6292468,3,B00IT3KQWM,"I got to borrow Doctor Who Season 8 from my local library and just finished watching the whole thing.  It took me an episode or two to get used to Peter Capaldi as the new Doctor, but he DID win me over. I began to really like Mr. Capaldi as the new, older, wiser, more reflective and grumpier Doctor.

What didn't 'win me over' was the mounting annoyance of Clara (Jenna Coleman). Clara was okay with Matt Smith in Season 7 as 'Souffl Girl' and as the 'Impossible Girl'  but somehow her smarmy, manipulative, even disrespectful comments to the older, wiser (and grumpier) Doctor only came across as her being an overbearing, ungrateful, 'itch-bay'.

The writers could have made their relationship so much classier if they'd created a fatherly/grandfatherly - daughter/granddaughter relationship instead of Clara continually thinking she knew more than, or was smarter than, the Doctor.  It got to the point where I was hoping the Doctor would find a new companion, the sooner the better.

I loved all of the Doctor's previous companions (Rose, Martha, Amy, even Donna) but somehow, Clara didn't fit well with the new Doctor.  So many times in Season 8, Clara threatened the Doctor with different manipulative tricks  all of which I kept hoping were her last episode. But no. Clara kept popping back up and boring us to death.

One 'new' thing about Season 8, which I hadn't experienced before in any other Doctor Who season, was this impatient urge for whatever episode I was watching at the time to end  soon  hoping the next one would be better. But alas, not to be. The 'Mistress' episodes were the worst and I blame Coleman's poor acting and the horrible casting choice for 'The Mistress'.

Most villains in the Doctor Who series you just 'love to hate'  but 'The Mistress' (Michelle Gomez) was just too irritating to bother with. Not sure how Ms. Gomez convinced anyone to give her the part but she just plain STUNK!  Gawd! Even worse than Coleman, if that's possible.

However, on a brighter note, I thought Samuel Anderson (Danny Pink) was great  unfortunately, it doesn't look like he's gonna be in Season 9. Won't give away anything, but Mr. Anderson, along with Peter Capaldi, made Season 8 watchable.

I have bought, from Amazon, ALL the previous seven seasons of Doctor Who  from Christopher Eccleston (Season 1) through David Tennant (Seasons 2-4) and Matt Smith (Seasons 5-7) and all of the Specials.  Needless to say, I won't be paying money to buy Season 8. I can only hope Season 9 will be better.

Edit: I just had the pleasure of watching ""The Last Christmas"" and it was fantastic. Even Clara redeemed herself, so maybe the writers are getting the 'feel' for this new Doctor and his companion a bit better. Anyway, worth a look-see.",1465862400,,2752,4.765822784810126

6292482,5,B00IT3KQWM,"I confess, I am not capable of making a reasoned judgement of Doctor Who as I am addicted, I was introduced to the series a very long time ago, and once I became used to regeneration and new faces on the Doctor, I enjoyed every new Doctor and regretted the loss of each old Doctor.  I am unable to compare the Doctors as each had his pluses and minuses, but I enjoyed every one for his take on a human appearing alien who had lived thousands (and finally, billions) of years saving the earth, living in London and it's surrounds, and teaming up with a succession of interesting, and mostly beautiful or at least cute female human companions.
So my conclusions about season 8? I hardly remember which episodes those were; I enjoyed every one..  If you already love Doctor Who, you will enjoy them, if you don't like them, these will be no better, but if you have never seen the series, I recommend you start with the earliest episode you can find, as you will eventually want to watch many episodes and the are better in sequence as there are an incredible number of internal references that help to enrich the series.
That said: five stars for each and every season.  Enjoy.",1465603200,,1174,4.4766355140186915

6292512,5,B00IT3KQWM,"Of all the seasons of Doctor Who which I have watched so far (up to this season of New Who), this is the most consistently-delivering season, with consistently fantastic episodes. They're told with a tight and concise style and hold attention very effectively; visually creative and beautifully and audaciously shot.
The stories are some of the best I've ever seen on Doctor Who: ""Listen"" and ""Deep Breath"" are in the running with ""Dalek"" and ""The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances"" for my favorite Doctor Who stories of all time. They're very well told, with a very real sense of menace, akin to ""Blink,"" ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead,"" and ""Midnight."" In fact, ""Listen"" was the most terrifying Doctor Who episode I have ever seen, in my opinion, but I couldn't stop watching.
On the other hand, I don't know if this season would make good family-friendly viewing material. I wouldn't recommend it for young children, certainly; parts of it are too dark and too scary, and I doubt that very young children would appreciate the plot twists fully.
I'm sure, from all the criticisms I've seen of Clara, that this season won't be everyone's cup of tea, however. But for myself, I have to rate this season five stars.",1465257600,,1222,4.8238095238095235

8645202,3,B00IT3KQWM,"Once it was a time, there used to be aliens, WHO, HOW, and WHY used to be so much brilliant and the ending used to be so perfect and unpredictable. But season 8 was none of them. I used to love the ending of every episode more than every other part but I found not even one episode with an epic ending. The Doctor is also not as he used to be. He just finds out who and why but it's always other who does it how. I think the doctor is old now and so his intellect.
This is my personal opinion. NO Offense though.",1525737600,,512,3.839622641509434
8645203,5,B00IT3KQWM,The first time around I didn't care for the first episode. I started watching it a few years after it aired and its charm has finally come out. I suppose losing the 10th and 11th left me scarred and bitter towards the franchise. 12 is growing on me!,1525219200,,249,4.208333333333333

8645205,1,B00IT3KQWM,"As big Tom Baker fans we are reticent to watch the more current Dr. Who episodes.  They are just bad.  However, we decided to give Mr. Capaldi's regeneration a shot.  A few minutes in to the first episode we were introduced to the insinuation of a lesbian love affair between two females, the one of which was given the external appearance of a reptile, perhaps to soften the blow.  We turned it off and are done with these new shows.  It is understood that the average person does not care in the least about such things and would probably view my household as bigoted.  So be it.  However, that filth is not going on over here.",1521417600,,629,4.370689655172414
8645206,3,B00IT3KQWM,"I've really enjoyed binge watching this show for the past few months, but this season really made me take a step back and watch other shows in between. It is very dark- and almost too theoretical. A few of the timelines get so confusing that it's hard to understand the episodes. I miss the older seasons, where, despite all the terrible things happening, there was always an element of humor- of laughing in the face of impossible odds. If this continues, I'm not sure I'll be watching this show for much longer, sadly.",1519948800,2,520,4.602150537634409
