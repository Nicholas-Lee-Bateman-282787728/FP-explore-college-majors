3766339,3,B001QOGXUA,"For those who have not read the book -- it's about a girl who is a crazy shopaholic, deep in debt. Her parents are frugal, but clearly never taught this to their daughter, because she can justify buying just about anything. She's a writer and ends up in a job at a finance magazine, with of course, a hot boss. How is she going to teach people to spend wisely and save their pennies when she's being stalked by a debt collector? Typical girly movie, in the same realm as Bridget Jones.

I've read all the shopaholic books and think they're great fun when I need a break from novels and crime stories. So when I found they were making the 1st book into a movie, I was really looking forward to it, but it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be.

This is by no fault of Isla Fisher who is adorable or Hugh Dancy who's dashing, charming and perfect for the role. It seems to be lacking some heart to be honest, the whole movie was just very shallow. Not to say the book is a total tear jerker, but this just didn't live up to it. And some of the clothes, I mean, really?! They frightened me! I couldn't imagine a 'fashionista' wearing some of that stuff, it was like clown clothing. That might be part of the humor in Becky Bloomwood, that she's getting herself into loads of debt, and for crazy ugly stuff no less. Also, the moving, sometimes talking mannequins freaked me out.

If it's just mindless entertainment you're looking for, by all means, watch it. While it was cute, it lacks that heart warming quality that is essential in my favorite romantic comedies.",1239408000,3,1560,4.335616438356165
3766340,3,B001QOGXUA,"This is a cute, fairly mindless way to pass an hour and a half.  The movie was enjoyable for the most part.  My only big gripe is how little it actually tied in with the book.

3766342,4,B001QOGXUA,"We start with Rebecca Bloomwood, the charming and absolutely adorable Isla Fisher. She has a knack for labels and finding sales in order to own them. She uses the analogy of falling in love and compares it to the satisfaction of trading plastic for goods. Heart melts like butter when she sees a store, and she always dreamed of using her magic cards. At one point we see her buying a 120 scarf and splitting it over five cards and still coming up 23 dollars short. When she realizes she has a problem, over 12 credit cards, she also realizes her boss has rolled over on the company and she no longer has a job. The hillarious tragedies that ensue over these many complications only get better as the debt collectors find her. Very cute movie, good for taking your mind off of things, especially in these hard economic times.",1234915200,18,825,4.506666666666667
3766343,3,B001QOGXUA,"Happily, I paid only $4.75 to watch director P. J. Hogan's 2009 film, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic.""  Perhaps, I should have saved my money.  In these times of economic instability we are told that every penny counts and unfortunately a storyline that centers around a twenty-something girl wandering around Manhattan like a free credit-card wielding electron willing to swipe multiple magnetic strips to purchase anything window dressed mannequins offer without the ability of even making a minimum payment at the 15th of the month, seems almost nostalgically simple-minded.  Watching hordes of women queued up to enter a designer's sample sale and then participating in an infantile tug of war for red Pucci boots in this frugal climate could be likened to observing a traditional ritual from some arcane village uncovered after centuries of isolation by the cameras of National Geographic.  Is the release of this film now merely bad timing for Mr. Hogan?  Or perhaps it sparkles with opportunity as a cutesy cautionary tale of pursuing the trappings of an American Dream gone to credit collection nightmare while still dropping the names of expensive designer labels with light speed frequency?

There are a few close-to-home zingers as when lead character Rebecca Bloomwood (the saucer-eyed Isla Fisher of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers-Unrated-Widescreen-New-Line-Platinum-Series/dp/B000BKVQS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers - Unrated (Widescreen New Line Platinum Series)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Definitely-Maybe-Widescreen/dp/B0017JHQPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Definitely, Maybe (Widescreen)</a>) prompted by her attractive new boss (Hugh Dancy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evening/dp/B000V6LSOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evening</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jane-Austen-Book-Club/dp/B000ZS8GW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jane Austen Book Club</a>) to query Comintex CEO at the podium of the company's annual meeting as to why bonuses were still appropriated to its officers while stockholders took a hit.  But for the most part, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" tries so hard to be a fluffy continuance of the fashionista's Mecca of labels and love resuscitated by ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-the-City-The-Movie-Special-Edition/dp/B001DDBCUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and the City - The Movie (Special Edition)</a>,"" that any serious theme gets blown away in the detritus of a clothing tornado that literally and excessively expands way beyond the confines of the room the financially strapped Rebecca must live in at her friend's apartment.

The plotline follows the tried and true formula of the intelligent small town girl reaching beyond her lower-to-middle class background to accomplish a headlining achievement in the big city.  Sadly, the script does not allow the vivacious Isla Fisher to indicate any real genius other than piece together a doubtful overnight success of a column combining sound money advice with common sense by using ""Finance for Dummies"" as her foundation for an investment monthly in a family of magazines that includes the fashion rag for which she really wishes to write.  The bulk of the film pits Rebecca's sad financial floundering against her uniquely plain speak manner of explaining fiscal solvency.  Zany antics that quite frankly would never fly in any of today's corporate situations yet worked in the girl-makes-good genre of 40s cinema abound--a mini-skirted Ms Fisher unwisely and unattractively sprawls across a conference table in an attempt to stop her boss from speaking with and hence discovering the debt collector that hounds her.  She bangs herself into glass doors, teeters precariously in elevator heels that add a klutz factor rather than sex appeal and stomps through a Latin rhythm on a South Beach dance floor in a way that would make Ginger Rogers cringe. What worked for Lucille Ball in the 50s defined desperate and ""I'll-try-anything"" as funny--however, Ms Ball always seemed ladylike and elegant where Ms. Fisher's modern Carrie Bradshaw sense of style simply does not lend to this categorization.

Does it work anyway?  Not as well as it did in the madcap heroine era of the black and white 40s. The audience knew the outcome ahead of time but nevertheless it rooted shamelessly anyway.  I can't say that I felt the same way about ""Confessions of a Shopaholic.""  Swathed in shades of tangerine, fuchsia and heliotrope that compliment her hair, Ms Fisher moves through this film with reckless abandon.  She's cute--actually she's adorable--but her insouciant wide-eyed lying with regard to her elaborate unaffordable lifestyle comes off as more than slightly pathological.  Could her frugal parents (Joan Cusack and John Goodman) be at fault? After all, they bought her brown and sensible when she wanted pink and sensational.  Thankfully, we never quite understand what drives Rebecca's addiction--Hogan isn't crazy enough to make it look as if there was some big psychological reason behind all that expensive frou-frou.

Bottom line?  ""Confessions of a Shopaholics"" attempts to recapture the great madcap comedies of 1940's Hollywood.  While the story lines may be fun in the Kinsella series from which the movie is based,  the presentation of the film during the current financial squeeze doesn't really work as well as it should.  Don't go for the fashion; Ms Fisher combines animal prints with neons, colored tights and too high shoes that do not really work for her body type.  She, nevertheless, has great potential as a comedian with the right material.  Recommended only for those who have to see it.

3766344,3,B001QOGXUA,"For a romantic comedy to remain in its genre, there are certain boundaries that it mustn't cross.  So we really can't begrudge such a film for playing it safe and Confessions of a Shopaholic does just that - the actual predicaments and resolutions may not necessarily be predictable but the progression is.  Our financially nave protagonist inadvertently finds her calling while awaiting what she feels she's always wanted, but her addictions (and a few mean people) strive to bring her down.  As she reaches rock bottom she will inevitably conquer her demons and rise once again.  Perhaps closer analysis may uproot a deeper message as her boss's journey contradicts her own; while he yearns not to be defined by family she discovers that it is indeed those loved ones that define her.  But alas, a few klutzy slapstick gags later and such trivialities quickly immerse themselves back beneath the surface.

Struggling with her debilitating obsession with shopping and the sudden collapse of her income source, Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher) unintentionally lands a job writing for a financial magazine after a drunken letter-mailing mix-up.  Ironically writing about the very consumer caution of which she herself has not abided, Rebecca's innovative comparisons and unconventional metaphors for economics grants her critical acclaim, public success, and the admiration of her supportive boss Luke (Hugh Dancy).  But as she draws closer to her ultimate goal of writing for renowned fashion magazine Alette, she questions her true ambitions and must determine if overcoming her ""shopaholic"" condition will bring her real happiness.

The fish-out-of-water story seems to keep popping up in every single romantic comedy of late; Confessions of a Shopaholic is no exception, although the supporting characters and environment that surrounds star Isla Fisher is entirely more pleasant. In fact, her wide-eyed, perky and cheery attitude brightens the screen, even if the plot is unduly contrived and understandably formulaic. She's believable, relatable to a great many, and eye candy for the rest - which is more than can be said for most of the generic female-oriented films that flood the market every Valentine's weekend (and several weeks prior).

Like last year's How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (which this surpasses), Confessions of a Shopaholic works around the same humorous elements that made the far superior films Big and Working Girl successful: an open-minded boss who's willing to risk hiring an unqualified (or outstandingly creative) employee for the chance on a fresh point of view; and the joys of seeing said underdog rise to the top, against the norm, utilizing random luck at every turn, and combating jealous coworkers. The pattern is simple, the outcome is assured, and while no scene dares to stare originality in the face, this fluffy, buoyant romantic comedy manages to entertain expectedly and as it should.

Randomly moved from London to New York, it never really comes together, and it differs so widely from the book that the best of the book never comes through.  The movie is supposed to be funny but...it's not.

3766672,5,B001QOGXUA,"The Confessions of A Shopaholic film stars Isla Fisher as shopping fanatic Rebecca Bloomwood, Krysten Ritter plays Bloomwoods best friend Suze while John Goodman and Joan Cusack play  Rebecca Bloomwoods parents Graham and Jane Bloomwood. Rebecca Bloomwood initially vies to work for Alette Naylors (Kristin Scott Thomas) magazine but Alicia Billington (Leslie Bibb) ends up with the job. However, she finds out through one of the receptionists Allon (Stephen Guarino) that Successful Savings magazine is hiring. There is a reference to the Wizard of Oz movie during a discussion between the Allon character and the Rebecca Bloomwood character when Allon lets Bloomwood know about the Successful Savings job interview. Fortunately, things start to look up for Rebecca Bloomwood even more when she is hired by Luke Brandon (Hugh Dancy) for a job at Successful Savings. Additionally, Rebecca Bloomwood helps boost the professional profile of her boss Luke Brandon after she writes an article and Luke Brandon ends up being praised by one of the bosses Edgar West (John Lithgow) at his job. There are more plot elements and actors/actresses involved in this movie yet I must avoid saying more for right now. However, this movie did inspire me to follow my dream of going back to school to get another degree in what I want to study regardless of what my critics say and even if I start over again at a community college.  Additionally, I have not used a credit card since 2013 but the movie inspired me to be more diligent with building up my savings account in my new job that I start around mid to late July (as well as having me curious to check out the book).  My husband has joked with me that Im an advertisers dream and I understand that the joke is nothing for me to brag about. However, my husband has also unconditionally loved me through both challenging and good times and his love has actually inspired me to continue to aim higher professionally and personally. This reminds me of  how watching the character of Hugh Dancy and how he sees the good in Rebecca Bloomwood when most people in real-life might only look for faults kind of reminded me of the rose colored glasses that Im fortunate that my husband metaphorically wears with me and his loving treatment of me. Additionally, I liked the plot element of how the character of Hugh Dancy pushes Rebecca Bloomwood to be her best.",1466467200,,2393,4.829268292682927

3766868,4,B001QOGXUA,"I know this film isn't a good movie. It's a little cliched, the acting can really be off sometimes, it's predictable, and some jokes are a complete miss. But I have no idea why I love this movie so much. I'm usually very critical about movies but I really love this movie despite all it's flaws. It's entertaining and a lot of fun. The biggest problem is that sometimes everything feels forced or it's by the numbers rom-com formula. It's message is great but also kind of muddled at times. It's definitely not for everyone, but I really had fun watching it. I did like the characters, especially the cheap parents. I don't know why I love this movie so much but I do. If you read the book, you're going to be kind of disappointed but just take it as a different version of events. For example, Wizard of Oz doesn't follow it's original material but it's still a great film. So please judge the film on it's own merit, not on the differences between the book. It's a lot of fun and I recommend it to those with an open mind.",1450915200,,1024,4.310880829015544

3767154,5,B001QOGXUA,I love this movie.  Its about a gal with credit cards who loves to shop.  It's funny and encourages responsibility and growing up and that debt isn't a good thing.  I think it's good to show our kids that credit cards are not magic and that they often end up costing waaaaay more than you want to spend.

3767400,5,B001QOGXUA,"First off, I would never want Isla's wardrobe in this movie (she goes overboard, but I realize that's the point).

But it really does highlight that want for 'things' and how hard it is to resist.  (Because, who hasn't impusively bought that beautiful pair of boots that you only wear when the weather is perfect and it's dry, and it's a perfect 67.5 degrees out or else they're not warm/cool enough to wear and could get ruined in the wet? Oh, just me?) Honestly, I think it's safe to say, we can all relate.

It's filled with not-too-hidden sage advice for young folk trying to get a job, trying to look the part without breaking the bank, and has a super cute love story with an adorable and rather young Hugh Dancy.

Just good fun!",1416009600,4,735,4.4222222222222225

The did say @ss, but aside from that was pretty clean. I like seeing romances that teach lessons and show people falling in love but doesn't have to get dirty about it. Also a great financial lesson to teens about how too much spending can get you into trouble.

3767435,2,B001QOGXUA,"My high school students liked it, especially the girls. Sadly, The male love interest falls for the shopaholic when she is wearing lavish and expensive clothes. The subtle implication is that he's attracted to expensively clad women. He purchases expensive clothes for himself and this further impresses her. The films intention of showing how not to slide into debt buying lavish, costly clothes on credit seems to back fire. Moreover, the solution for her debt encourages others to fall into the same pattern of ridiculous buying sprees.",1412294400,,539,5.206896551724138

3767492,4,B001QOGXUA,"Obviously the books are always way better than the movies they make out of them. However, this movie did not follow the book. NONE of it. Other than the character's names, and Becky's need to shop, this movie is completely different from the book. It is entertaining, as long as you realize going in that you are not going to find some deep meaning and you need to see it for the light hearted comedy it is supposed to be. I would have preferred it to follow the book more closely, but have watched it a few times since its release onto DVD. Not sure it is worth buying, but borrowing it from the library and curling up on the couch with a glass of wine and watching this by myself or with a friend is a guilty pleasure. Just don't expect your husband or boyfriend to sit through it with you.",1402963200,,792,4.217105263157895

3767568,5,B001QOGXUA,"Having a friend or two that fit loosely into the shopaholic category, this movie always provides a good laugh. Although exaggerated, the acting is outstanding in its characterizations. The subtle hint of romance adds just the right touch to make it a re-watch on a gray day.

3767584,5,B001QOGXUA,"I probably watched this movie over a dozen times because it's such a fun movie.  Every character has a quirky personality and the laughter and silliness continues throughout the entire movie.  Even if you rarely shop, you may still relate to the characters in some way because the movie focuses on many areas, including relationship, family and friends.  One of the funnies quotes in the movie is ""I can do affordable fashion. I mean, I know where all the sales are."" lol.",1391472000,,472,4.7317073170731705

3767588,4,B001QOGXUA,"Typical Rom-com, but a very charming one.  Minimal use of crude humor and genuinely funny.  Hilarious performances by Joan Cusack, Krysten Ritter, and Isla Fisher.  This film is a classic example of a light and heart-warming chick-flick.  I'd say its TOTALLY slumber-party approved. ;)",1390089600,,285,5.409090909090909

3767623,5,B001QOGXUA,"I went on the search for some good, clean romantic comedies and I came up with this one. Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy pair up together in this comical story about a girl who is completely obsessed with shopping and fashion. The story is cute, the character's are hilarious and well rounded, and the clothes are quite fabulous.

3767628,5,B001QOGXUA,"This story is very lovable.  It lets us know how we can get addicted to something and not realize the consequences behind it.  It does it in an amusing and loving way.  We should never allow any thing to take control of our lives.  We must be in charge, not a charge card in charge.  The actors and actresses were great and believable.

3767632,4,B001QOGXUA,"I got the movie after I read the book - it's the way I try to understand the thought process of the characters which are not always verbalized in the movie.  It was a pleasant movie with maturing characters and a happy ending. That being said, I was disappointed in the changes made to the original book. Too many of the passages I found humorous were left out entirely and the build up to the ""romance"" didn't have the believability for me. I know screen time is condensed but I thought it could have been done better. I realize that is not the the problem of this review; it should be directed to the screen writers!",1379980800,,618,4.327586206896552

3767659,1,B001QOGXUA,"The reason I chose to rate this film with one star is because of how shallow I personally felt it was. In a broad sense, I find this movie to be un-relatable to the general public. The coloring of the film was very dim and unattractive. The main character did not seem to have very good taste in clothing, even if it was aimed towards a superior fashion than how most people dress. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I do not have the most sophisticated taste in ""chick flicks"", however this didn't really give me that warm/happy-go lucky feeling you enjoy getting from a pointless romance that you watch for the laughs and beautiful people. On one last note, the main male character Amy Adams falls in love with...we never really make a connection with him, in spite of his dorky, but charming behavior...he was not memorable.",1376092800,,845,4.602649006622516

3767839,5,B001QOGXUA,"Anyone who has watched an addiction slowly ruin every part of a loved one's, or their own life-and destroy the lives of everyone who loves them in the process (barrel of laughs, guys),will NOT think this movie is ""hilarious."" I considered it a drama with some funny scenes.

Yet it's a great film about compulsive shopping destroying the life of a young woman named Rebecca. It's about her addiction causing her partner to be about to lose his whole career. It's about her addiction causing her loving parents to be on the verge of losing over $13,000. It's about Rebecca breaking her best friend's heart when the friend is sold out to Rebecca's addiction And it's about watching Rebecca live like a hunted animal because an unethical bill collector is stalking her and trying to sabotage her employment. All the while the story is peppered with humorous scenes and is aesthetically pleasing, especially to anyone who loves clothes.

I won't give away the ending other than to say ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" gives a lot of hope to anyone now in the chains of their own or someone else's addiction. Additionally it educates people in that situation about what to expect when they walk into that first support group meeting.

I recommend it for anyone but especially those distressed because an addiction has them or someone they love in it's grip. Whether one's addiction is to shopping,alcohol,another drug, gambling,eating,or anything else,the same principles apply as to how the addiction takes over one aspect after another of peoples' lives. By the time Rebecca realizes the chains are there,they have already become too tight for her to get herself free without help. The lives of her best friend and her boyfriend have to get completely crazy before they realize there's a problem.

The same principles also apply to the ways people controlled by addictions regain control of their lives, whatever the addiction  may be.(Although if one's addiction is to a chemical there may be psychological AND physical addiction. Thus someone with a chemical addiction may need the added steps of medical care. People addicted to shopping or gambling can get by with much less  medical attention.)

This is an easy-to-watch,encouraging story about a dead serious topic. You can watch ""Days of Wine and Roses"" another night.",1361059200,,2319,5.0234375

I rented it when I had to stay home from work to take care of my 10 year-old daughter who was sick and we decided to rent something funny.  I had fun watching my daughter laugh her little butt off, especially during the dancing scene.  I really liked Isla Fisher, which could be Amy Adam's twin.  Isla is really funny in an innocent, but crafty kind of way, especially when trying to squirm her way out of talking to the debt collectors.

Isla did make this movie funny. But also at times a little cheesy. Becky was still loveable though. Hugh Dancy was just so yummy in this. He played the ideal Luke Brandon. Joan Cusack and John Lithgow added humor as Becky's parents.

3768022,5,B001QOGXUA,"First off I should say that Romantic Comedies are not my thing at all.  It is my least favorite genre and almost all romantic comedy films make me gag.  But this film had the opposite effect on me.  It is cute, funny, and the sentimentality isn't so over the top as to make you want to puke.  I first saw this movie in italy (dubbed in italian) and thought it was so cute and funny.  Then when I got back to America I saw it again in English with some friends and they enjoyed it just as much as my italian friends.  It's not as predictable as other rom coms because it is a well written script and the acting is wonderful.  Virtually all rom-coms have the whole ""lets pretend act like we hate each other or don't have feelings for each other when we really want to jump each other's bones and you know soon we will be doing just that because it's a rom-com"" vibe.  In this movie though there is no attraction between the main characters in the beginning.  They don't hate each other or pretend to either.  The man just honestly believes the girl is a twit at first and the girl just honestly believes the guy doesn't give her the chance she deserves.  We get to see the honest unfolding of two people's respect for one another grow... and it is from that respect comes attraction and love.

One of the problems with making a movie based on a book is that people who read the book first will always want the movie to match it.  Well movies can't for the most part match the books their based on, unless the movie is willing to be at least 6 hours long. They are two separate mediums and should be treated as such.  This was a great script (almost an oxymoron when you're talking about romantic comedy.  Almost none are written well).  Just done well over all.",1344211200,3,1759,4.268882175226586

3768060,4,B001QOGXUA,"""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" (2009) is directed by P.J. Hogan (My Best Friend's Wedding). Isla Fisher stars as a shopaholic journalist (Rebecca Bloomwood) who can't control her shopping habits, all the while trying to work her way into a prestigious fashion magazine called ""Alette"". She starts off working for the magazine ""Successful Saving"" in the hopes of working her way up to ""Alette"" magazine, and it is here, while working for Luke Brandon (Hugh Dancy) that she becomes an unexpected success with her uniquely down to earth articles. Rebecca Bloomwood is an effervescent, funny, well meaning, if awkward, young lady, who stumbles along but manages to find a viable career writing about what she knows so well, while attempting to hide the fact from everyone, including herself, that she doesn't practice what she writes about. Basically she is totally out of control with her spending to the point of being delusional at times, and this leads to a constant string of hilarious mishaps, including her ongoing evasions with the bill collector. The film has witty observations, madcap slapstick episodes, and clever sight gags with animated mannequins, while Isla Fisher has an infectious charm and klutzy physicality that makes this film fun to watch. This romantic comedy also stars John Lithgow, Kristin Scott Thomas, Joan Cusack, and John Goodman.

The bonus features include bloopers, deleted scenes, and a music video of ""Stuck With Each Other"". The quality of this dvd is excellent as the bright colourful palette of images that make up this film joyously fill the screen.",1314835200,,1585,5.167315175097277

Well, I missed the movie in theaters and kind of forgot about it until I was flipping through my on-demand listings tonight (yes, 2 years later!). I knew from the movie trailer/commercials that it was going to be different (ie, Becky & co being American, set in NY, etc), but wow, I had no idea how different the movie would be. I feel like the differences really ruined the movie too. In the movie, Luke is a total schlub, works for a magazine, and there's that whole fashion magazine thing. None of that happens in the books, nor do Suzy and Tarkie get married until later. It was a total train wreck.

3768106,2,B001QOGXUA,"This movie should have worked but the writing was so lame it just failed on so many levels. Given the stellar supporting cast (John Lithgow, SNL's Fred Armisen, John Goodman, Joan Cusack, Airplane's Julie Hagerty and even the usually mannish Kristin Scott Thomas), even they cannot save this disaster.

One great failing is the lead male role as Hugh Dancy just has no screen appeal at all. He just seems ""there""--that's all. There's no sense of comedic timing or even of how to play a romantic lead. Isla Fisher is her usual effervescent self but maybe she has just rehashed that persona once too much. Her BFF in the movie, Krysten Ritter, just seems like a poor woman's Anne Hathaway.

Also, this DVD version gives you only deleted scenes and extremely boring unfunny outtakes. Not that I was expecting much from a ""so what!?"" movie.",1304726400,3,836,4.758620689655173

3768111,2,B001QOGXUA,"I loved the novel but the movie takes away the British heroine's intelligence, resourcefulness and wit and replaces it with a shallow, dim-witted New Yorker who just likes to shop. Sight gags and silly incidents replace the genuine humor and British understatement that gave the book its bite. Instead, we have a film that endorses Rebecca's mindless consumerism while hypocritically making fun of her situation. Given that Hollywood is all about making money off of gullible princesses like Bloomwood (product placement in the film is rampant, whereas in the book no real brand names are used), is it any wonder that the social criticism of the book is tempered and rendered toothless? An obnoxious music score only makes it worse, making it feel like a Sex and the City film sequel. Since this film was made by a major studio and is not an indie, its objective is to encourage behavior like Becky's, rather than treat it as a serious problem. No wonder it's all slapstick and innuendo. God forbid anyone should come away from the film reluctant to spend money on silly trifles. The book showed how insecurity, emotional immaturity and consciousness of class and status can combine to encourage someone to shop endlessly. Instead of a cautionary tale, it's a silly comedy of a girl who gets into serious debt but still comes out smelling like a rose. It's like watching a film about alcoholism sponsored by Johnnie Walker.",1291939200,4,1423,4.908713692946058

I hadn't even heard of it when I spotted it at my local library and when I noticed Hugh Dancy was one of the main characters; I had to give it a try. I'd just loved him in Ella Enchanted.

3768135,2,B001QOGXUA,"I love me some Isla Fisher.  She is like a spunky and less talented yet somewhat better looking Amy Adams and I just adore her for all of that.  Her comedic timing is pretty impeccable and she always brings a gigantic smile to my face, despite the fact that she stars in a lot of mediocre and formulaic comedies.  `Confessions of a Shopaholic' isn't really any different to tell you the truth.  It is fun and at times funny and it has a certain layer of charm, but overall the film is dreadfully predictable and very generic.

Thankfully, Fisher is hilariously endearing.

The film revolves around a girl named Rebecca who has a severe shopping problem.  Apparently the world is a bad place unless she is spending a ton of money on things she doesn't need.  This is rather odd since she has a loving family and a crazy awesome best friend and she is doing what she loves.  Anyways, in an attempt to get a job working for a prestigious fashion magazine she winds up getting a job at one of their sister magazines which focuses on finance, something she has no clue about.  Her charm and `every woman' perspective though, not only get her hired but get her a lot of attention and accolades.

The girl in the green scarf is a hit.

Her past eventually catches up with her and life bites her in the butt, but you can be pretty confident that she'll land on her feet.

There just isn't much going on here.  That is sad, since the current run of movies in this genre is starting to look overwhelmingly sub-par.  It is like everyone in Hollywood has suddenly gone lazy.  These films don't need to have a point and they don't need to offer us anything different anymore.  They just have to place pretty people in familiar situations (preposterous, yet somehow familiar).  In other words; these film don't need to make sense anymore, and that bothers me.

High Dancy is kind of lifeless, but attractive so he works as a prop for Fisher to gush over.  Krysten Ritter is frantic and insanely charismatic.  It works half of the time.  John Goodman and Joan Cusack are clichs through and through, but they are veteran character actors who know how to do what they do very well, and it shows.  Leslie Bibb looks awful here, and I genuinely think that she is the definition of beautiful...but what happened to her cheekbones?  Kristen Scott Thomas has a thankless yet subtly hilarious cameo, and John Lithgow really deserved a bigger role (who doesn't just LOVE him).  In the end, the only think that makes this uninspired rom-com work is Isla Fisher's dedicated adorableness.

3768137,5,B001QOGXUA,"I haven't read any of the novels associated with this movie, so this review is coming from a person who has only viewed the movie and has not read the book(s).  So be nice,  pwetty pwease?

""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" was EXACTLY what I needed after a particular grueling 2 weeks of stress, stress, more stress, and being ill, ill, exhausted, and just... BLAH!!  This movie cheered me up instantly.  The lively music, the different colors and sets, and Isla's sweet, 'ditzy-ish' and fun-loving character, Bex.  I'm so glad that Isla finally got her very own first REAL starring gig, BTW.  She didn't disappoint me at all.

What makes this movie particularly humorous to me, is that I've worked as a retail sales representative at ""Victoria's Secret"" for a pretty long time ... so Isla just completely had me completely cracked up because... well... at one time I was the same-exact way.  Literally. Addicted. To. Shopping.  I was basically working for ""Victoria's Secret"" and its business partners for completely FREE.  Yes.  FREE.  Why? Because basically, all the money that I made went right back into that company... over and over and over again repeatedly.  I mean, I had a 30 percent employee discount!  DUH!!  What the eff else was I supposed to do??  :P

Sssooooo, let's just say things kinda' got out-of-hand, and I finally decided to put in my 2 weeks notice--which the managers and sales leaders were not very happy with at all because I was especially good at my craft.... as well as handing over my paycheck back to them, too.  *snicker*  They loved me because I was able to milk the customers out of all their money in their wallets, as well as the company milking my wallet out right back.  Yep.  Anywho.... didn't mean to give you my retail service life-history there, but I think that it definitely played a major role in why I loved this film so much.

Isla Fisher is just too cute and too funny in here.  I never thought she was annoying. Plus, I've always loved the zany, off-the-wall characters she always plays.  I think this movie was made for her.  She reminded me a lot of 'Sarah Jessica Parker' with all her narrating, joking, accessory and shoe addictions, shopping antics, and her plain old ditziness, but also surprisingly witty self.

Now, I don't know why these duders chose the other weird ""Olive Oil Look-a-Like Girl"" to play her best friend, Suze.  I mean, she had her funny moments in the film, but she reminded me way too much of 'Anne Hathaway's' character in the beginning of ""The Devil Wears Prada.""  Many similarities between the two characters, IMO.  Maybe they tried to mimic Anne's character and physical traits a little bit since this was another fashionista-romantic-comedy chickflick, and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was such a success?  Hollywood does tends to do that.  Mimic what's ""in"" and what ""banked.""

Okay, I'm starting to ramble on a little bit here again, lol, but all in all I adored this movie.  And again, Isla Fisher was absolutely prescious as ""The Girl In The Green Scarf.""  The clothes, jewels, shoes, and accessories were to-die-for, of course.  The colors were fun, sexy, and flirty throughout the movie (we all know that orange is the new pink, now, lol!)... and it was just like... totally girly n' stuff, yanno'?  Nothing wrong with a little pointless, girly guilty pleasure popped into your DVD player every once and a while, right?  Right.

So... once again, I haven't read any of the books in this series (so please don't throw stones at me too hard).  This is an open and honest review from a retired retail sales representative of ""Victoria's Secret Limited Brands"".  And just knowing all the retail side of things--it all made perfect sense to me.  Oh and ppsssstt... I'm also a recovering shopaholic, as well. ;)",1283212800,,3785,4.76

I guess it was a sort of combination of Confessions of a Shopaholic and Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, but it was too loosely based on the books to have any of the appeal of the actual series.  I don't even know where to start with the discrepancies.  I understand that certain liberties must be taken when turning a book into a movie, but this one just fell flat.

I also thought that if I hadn't read the books, I really would have had no idea what the heck was going on in the movie.  It all just seemed so loosey-goosey tied together into a giant mess.  Don't get me wrong, I love Isla Fischer, and I think she could have been great as Becky Bloomwood if the movie had followed the books more closely.

3768139,4,B001QOGXUA,"Kind of a G rated mishmash of The Devil Wears Prada and Sex And The City, Confessions of A Shopaholic is a satisfying if lightweight comedy.  It's the perfect entertainment for a hot summer afternoon, requiring neither mental nor physical exertion.  I'd hoped it would feature great fashions, likeable characters, a heroine who was capable of extricating herself from her own messes and that the story would be over the top enough to enjoy without having to become too involved.  It delivered.

I've not read the Shopaholic books, so only have this movie to go on for story.  It's fantastic (in the sense of being a fantasy) with some surreal elements--store mannequins talk--but it works. In true romantic comedy fashion, there are incredible coincidences, strokes of luck both good and bad, and Great Misunderstandings happily resolved in the end.  Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy are charming leads and the supporting cast is strong as well, with Kristin Scott Thomas having a great time as the French publisher of a fashion magazine and John Goodman and Joan Cusack playing Rebecca's fond and frugal parents.

Confessions Of A Shopaholic is definitely a chick flick probably appealing more to younger chicks.  Though it comes dangerously close, Rebecca's wide-eyed naivete never becomes tedious and there's enough realism to Rebecca's scrapes to keep the movie interesting.",1280448000,,1372,5.176470588235294

3768187,1,B001QOGXUA,"I usually like chick flicks. And characters like Elle Woods from Legally Blonde or Cher from Clueless are truly likeable 'airheads' with good hearts. This movie, though, is really annoying and borders on being pathetic. You can see the attempts at copying other movies like Bridget Jones, Legally Blonde and a few others, albeit it landing on its bottom - hard.
The attempts at showing the leading character's fun side to draw laughs are really annoying. For example, when she was dancing with Hugh Dancy's character and doing those ridiculous moves with her fan.... It was more embarrassing than hilarious!! It was really painful. And the unnecessary shrill shrieks from other females are more 'what is wrong with them' than happily infectious, as supposedly intended.
Hugh Dancy has zero screen presence and looks almost comical in a tuxedo. He has no ooomph, and a very, very poor version of Hugh Grant - who, BTW, has not much of a body, but looks great in expensive clothes! Dancy's facial expressions show uncertainty as to what he is doing starring in this movie. And chemistry between him and Isla Fischer..? Zero.
Her cluelessness, is exasperating rather than endearing. And instead of rooting for her to see the light soon, you just want to laugh tauntingly when the debt-collector finally catches up with her live on TV. That was the highlight!
Really a pathetic attempt but a very real reflection of the women we see today. Rather than being just airheads like just a decade ago, these women have gotten worse - even becoming proud of their stupidity, which they wear as a badge.
The other characters are equally annoying. And most of them were supposed to be notable actors. Joan Cusack and John Goodman were so irritating, that girl playing Isla's best friend? You just want to slap her - hard! What's wrong with this hysterical witch? And she's getting married? Can you imagine the kind of kids she'll raise? Well, yeah. They already exist today, right? John Lithgow hardly register. Only Kristin Scott Thomas plays a passable role.

I wanted to slap Becks up-side her head for being such a flighty person who bordered on a hoarder and wouldn't listen to Suze, who was trying to seriously help her out. She had shopping blackouts when she didn't remember buying things, ducked out of the Shopaholic meetings (nice cameo by John Salley BTW), and kept her folks in the dark. Scary how many people really are in a lot of debt because they can't stop, but I really couldn't identify with this one (mostly because I am a cheap-o and not fashion conscious). It is just a breezy, romantic comedy, not too much to think about. It is about 1:50 long, nice for a rainy day when the hubby is not around.",1265587200,2,787,4.281879194630872
3768190,5,B001QOGXUA,"I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I was curious about it because I personally struggle with compulsive spending. I didn't even know it was based on a book series... but I'll definitely be reading those now that I know! Especially since virtually everyone thinks the books are better. (Update: I tried to read the book and couldn't finish it. I couldn't stand Becky!)

The movie is slapstick comedy (like ""I Love Lucy"") with some deeper moments sprinkled here and there to bring it back to planet Earth. The plot is totally unrealistic and WAY over-the-top, but often laugh-out-loud funny. And for me personally, it was also meaningful because of the subject matter.

I was very impressed with how accurately the movie depicted spending addictions, credit cards, and debt collectors. It's clear that many of the negative reviews were written by people unfamiliar with the realities of compulsive debting and spending.

Some reviewers derided her spending problem as being caused by an underlying character defect which made it impossible for them to want to 'root' for her. But it's an addiction akin to an alcohol or food addiction. It's not simply selfishness or airheadedness; it can be present in people who are otherwise very giving, caring and level-headed. The feelings she and the other overspenders depict, and describe in their meetings, are very real... though at times lampooned in the movie for the comedic value (which I found funny and not offensive at all; in fact, it felt good to be able to laugh about it). The back-and-forth conversations she had with herself about 'to buy or not to buy' were hauntingly familiar. ""I need these gloves because... it's winter, and I have hands! Yes!""

Many reviews also felt the debt collector was the one who was ""standing up for what's right"" and didn't like it that he was portrayed as being a jerk. I'm not a big credit card user, but we've had some past medical debts, and I've read a lot about debt and credit, including Debtor's Anonymous literature. In reality, collection agencies are extremely aggressive and can be very underhanded. They do exactly what the guy tells his colleague on the phone to do to be effective in getting money to get the commission. Yes, they do work on commission, and yes, they will pressure and manipulate and lie to try to collect. They will call several times daily unless they receive a written notice to stop, after which legally they have to stop. (I am not sure, though, that they'd ever actually show up at your door.) So it's not as black and white as people might think who don't have experience or knowledge of the issue.

As for the thought-provoking moments... Most of all, it was the very first scene which really got to me. I actually had to pause the movie and go cry! It's a scene from Becky's childhood, and I'd had a very similar childhood experience. It brought me right back even though it's been almost 30 years. It also touched on something that is pointed out in Debtors Anonymous: that being overly miserly with money is not good either and can lead to feelings of deprivation that one may try to overcome by overspending.

The other thing that really got to me is near the end, when the parents offer to sell something to help their daughter get out of debt. She tells them not to sell it because the item ""totally defines you."" Her father says something to the effect of, ""The only thing that defines me is you and your mom."" Compulsive spenders tend to feel that they are not whole or complete without being able to get the things they want. Her father's reply captures the healthy mentality: that material things do NOT define us.

Oh, and if you love fashion you'll love this movie for the fashion. I watched it again recently with a fashionista friend of mine. She salivated over the outfits in every scene, and said it was making her want to go shopping. But by the end, she told me the movie's plot made her NOT want to go shopping and just be grateful for the nice things she already has.

Overall, this movie for me was a mixture of some laugh-out-loud moments, some rolling my eyes 'yea right' moments, and some deeper thought-provoking moments. I don't think most people would find it thought-provoking unless they struggle with overspending. But if they do, this movie is good therapy.

To close, I want to share an excerpt from the 4-star review by Lori M. Reece because she is spot on (I hope it's OK to do this):

""Many reviewers seem to feel as though the movie glorifies materialism. I feel that the movie's actual moral is to ultimately show just how unimportant material possessions actually are. This, if you ask me, is quite reassuring in these trying economic times.""",1265155200,5,4722,4.7058111380145276
3768191,2,B001QOGXUA,"I like to shop.  There is nothing quite like going to a store (mostly a bookstore, I've noticed) and glancing at the shelves, seeing all the nice items neatly arranged, smelling the new purchase smell, holding the bags, glossing over your packages in the car...well, I think you get the picture.  So when this movie came out, I felt an immediate connection.  I wanted to see it.
Becky Bloomwood is like  me.  She was raised with an uber thrifty mother, who bought clothes and shoes to last, not to look good and whose religion was saving.  But now that Becky's an adult, she wants new, shiny...name brand.  Unfortunately, that has gotten her into trouble.  Sixteen thousand dollars worth of credit debt trouble, to be exact.  It really gets bad when her garden magazine goes under.  So she is forced to take a job at Successful Savings to make ends meet.  There she meets editor, Luke Brandon...and things get challenging as she has to conceal her personal finances at the magazine.
Please Note: Spoilers may appear.
The actors are great.  Isla Fisher is superb as young Becky, Krysten Ritter marvelous as Suze, Becky's best friend, and Hugh Dancy is always a delight to see.  Joan Cusack is wonderful as the mother (she almost reminds me of my mom!) and John Goodman is excellent as the father (again, reminds me of my dad!).
Even the basic plot is intriguing.  In this day and age, of credit cards, we have a huge problem with credit card debt, of wanting what we can't afford.
But the problems I had with this movie, and the ones that force the rating down so low, are how stupid the writers and directors must believe us viewers to be.  No interview is conducted in such a slipshod manner!  Becky would have no hope of being hired if she acted like the idiot she did upon meeting Luke Brandon the first time!  And getting hired within three minutes of Luke reading her ""amazing"" article about shoes?  ""As if!""  Speaking of writing, The Girl in the Green Scarf's articles supposedly so captivating are nothing to brag home to.  All it is are a few pieces written with terrible similes: ""Store cards are like cashmere coats"".  Geesh, if this is all one have to do in order to be a lauded writer at a respectable financial magazine, then everyone should be contributing to magazines!  Let's face it, finances are finances, whether concealed in cashmere coats or platinum shoes.  No fancifying it is going to make it magically appealing for this ""whole new demographic"".
Becky  makes a big deal about hiding the scarf she bought with the money she scammed off Luke...only, it is silly to assume he would immediately know she bought that scarf with his (hard-earned) money.  What if she had it in her bag?  Her being forced to wait tables at the ball?  Ludicrous.  The shopaholics anonymous sessions?  Insulting.  The people there were a bunch of morons, and the leader of the group was completely off her rocker, doing something that was completely inappropriate by forcing Becky to sell her newly purchased clothes.  The business trip to Miami?  Cringe-worthy.  No brand-new employee would be taken on a company trip like that!  And turning down the offer to write at Alette, after spending the whole movie clawing for it?  Aggravating!
I understand this wasn't meant to be a serious movie, but nonetheless, I don't like having my intelligence insulted while I try to relax and enjoy a film.  Perhaps others can ignore the faults I couldn't; that's great.  As for me, I give it 2 stars, and I feel that is more than reasonable.

Additional: Also, notice how it's only when Becky gets herself a man (to replace the void that the shopping addiction was fulfilling) that she really sees the errors of her ways and begins to get debt free.  Not to mention, her big ""Get out of Debt"" scheme is contingent on auctioning her crap to other poor women with her same affliction.  Number One, a man does NOT make life better, he does NOT bring meaning to life, he does NOT fill voids caused by an addiction.  I can guarantee you, if Becky goes into a relationship with this fallacy (known or unknown), the couple will be going their own separate ways in a few years, after the ""honeymoon"" period.
Number Two, some mistakes can't be rectified with a simple ""Dig out all you crap from your closet and sell it in a big, huge yard sale, milking off others' addictions"".  Don't you think it's convenient that she was able to raise EXACTLY the amount she needed?  Stupid.  Most people spend YEARS paying off debt and have to--gasp--live without!  Of course, that would mean Becky would have to make a huge lifestyle change, not a one minute ""I'm a different person"" whose life is immediately made perfect (and who could conceivably return to her spend-thrift ways the next day).

The only people who could possibly enjoy this movie would be annoying, pretentious, self-rightous women who think they can do anything they want in this world without any consequence....in other words, American girls.

This is another joke of a movie where the main character (a woman) lies to, steals from, cheats, and uses everyone and everything throughout the course of the movie...and in the end what happens, yea that's right, everyone comes back and gives her everything she ever wanted, although she never once apologizes or deserves these things.

3768279,1,B001QOGXUA,"Wow. This movie was bad.  Heinous.  Just awful.  The book was cute, but I could tell from watching the preview this was not the book.  Plus, with the economy like it is, I had a feeling I'd be irritated by the tale of a self-indulgent idiot spending money like a drunken sailor on shore leave.  But I figured at least the clothes will be fun to look at.  I like the outfit worn on the movie poster.

Alas, the clothes weren't even good.  In fact, the costumer seems to have some kind of vendetta against the actress, as she was clad in hideous outfits that seemed designed to make her look chunky and stumpy, neither of which she appears to actually be.

As for the movie itself, there was zero chemistry with her leading man, who came off as a wimpy jackass.  Why would any woman, let alone two, fight for him? Oh right, he's rich. Never mind.

Also, John Goodman must have helped the casting director hide a body.  There is no other explanation for his simply odious presence in this film.  His role as a cartoonish buffoon father was cringe-inducing and his acting is awful.  John Candy's dead and this guy's still walking around? Yeah, life's not fair.

I'm a chick movie connoisseur, and I've enjoyed some pretty crappy movies, but this one takes the cake. It's worse than Legally Blonde 2.  Need I say more?",1262044800,,1313,4.453781512605042
3768280,1,B001QOGXUA,"That's because she shouldn't let anyone confuse this with her very amusing Shopaholic series.  This film uses the title, but loses the story.  I don't know how much of a role Kinsella played in the screenplay for this film, but she would not be making a mistake to ask that her name be removed from the credits.

Anyone who has read a Shopholic story, knows that Becky Bloomwood is a very charming British woman with the unfortunate habit of spending her way into debt.  She's a successful financial advisor.  The character portrayed in this film by a very flat Isla Fisher is pathetic, unlikeable, and dumb.  How the Brendon of this film ever came to love someone so flightly is beyond comprehension.

This film is miscast throughout.  Joan Cussak, usually very funny in films, did possibly the worst acting job of her career here, and is joined by a declining John Goodman.  Everytime the twosome, as Becky's parents appear, you'll want to throw something at the screen to put them out of their misery.  And the same is true with the characterization of Suze, Becky's best friend and roommate.

This is truly a rotten egg of a film.  And if you saw the film without having read the book, at least you'll have something to look forward to.  Maybe the whole purpose of this film is to teach aspiring film makers how not to cast and make a movie.",1261958400,7,1345,4.577405857740586

3768282,5,B001QOGXUA,"I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did; in fact, I refrained from even renting it for months after it came out.  Then after seeing a trailer, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  Isla Fisher is completely adorable in this movie.  The premise of the movie--a girl who cannot curtail her shopaholic ways--makes it somewhat poignant as well as comedic.  Being a shopaholic is self-destructive for the character.  Fisher carries the role off well, though, inspiring compassion for her character and highlighting the addictive nature of shopping for susceptible people.  Although Hugh Dancy is not necessarily the actor I would have chosen for his role--I can see Ryan Reynolds or Nathan Fillion in the role more easily--he served as a good foil for Fisher's character.

The result is a delightful movie in which Fisher gets herself not only more deeply in debt but also more deeply trapped by her desperate attempts to cover up her shopaholic habit and the real identity of the collections agent who is becoming increasingly intrusive.  She manages to extricate herself from some nearly-catastrophic faux pas and still land on her feet, but as the movie draws closer to the end, she suddenly finds herself in a position where her hidden problems compromise her relationship with Dancy's character and she must make a decision about how to respond.  Fisher's performance is like a combination of Lucille Ball's comedic genius with Reese Witherspoon's winsome personality and Doris Day's girl-next-door look.  She is sweet but sassy, prone to getting herself into predicaments, and able to come up with creative ways to get out of said predicaments.  Above all, she is thoroughly entertaining.

I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it multiple times.  I also liked Isla Fisher in this so much that I'll be watching to see what she is starring in next and will definitely see it too.  I predict that her rising star will soon bring her big-ticket success.",1261785600,2,1977,4.877245508982036

3768316,2,B001QOGXUA,"A would-be satire on our consumer culture, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" is really just another lame-brained romantic comedy whose only real claim to fame is that it lays waste to more than the usual number of talented supporting players (John Goodman, Joan Cusack, Julie Hagerty, Kristin Scott Thomas, John Lithgow, Fred Armisen and Lynn Redgrave can be counted among its victims).

Isla Fisher plays Rebecca Bloomwood, a lifelong compulsive shopper who's racked up so many credit card bills that she`s being hounded day and night by a relentless collection agent.  Somehow, she manages to wrangle her way into a job as writer for a Manhattan-based business magazine, even though the only thing she apparently knows about money is how to spend it (she writes about the economy using banal shopping metaphors that we are supposed to believe are making financial complexity suddenly comprehensible for the illiterate masses).  The editor-in-chief is a British-accented dreamboat (Hugh Dancy of the superb ""Beyond the Gates"") who, of course, becomes Rebecca`s eventual love interest.  Soon, the young woman is the toast of the industry as her content-free articles become an inexplicable business and literary world sensation.

Based on the book series by Sophie Kinsella, ""Confessions,"" written by Tim Firth and Tracey Jackson and directed by P.J. Hogan, is a bargain-basement ""Devil Wears Prada"" knockoff marked by trumped-up high spirits and ineptly executed slapstick.  One can bear witness to only so many well-dressed socialites duking it out for fashion bargains before the whole thing begins to become more than a little insulting both to women and to the intelligence of its audience.  In fact, the very concept of the movie seems reactionary and sexist, as in, ""How cute, that this ditzy little airhead is endeavoring to explain the ins-and-outs of economics to all us stuffed-shirt businessmen.""  (Think of it as the publishing-world's answer to the ""Legally Blonde"" films).

Infrequently, the movie hits its satiric target, as in the scene where Rebecca attends a meeting of a Ten-Step Program for shopaholics, but the movie, as a whole, is little more that a series of missed opportunities.",1260144000,2,2201,5.283667621776504

Like Notting Hill, You've Got Mail, While You Were Sleeping, Legally Blonde..., etc... they are awesome because they have their own silly, fun moments that will stay in your heart years down the road...

One thing like a hot dog stand where she wanted to get ""cash back"" - HA! - to another, she gets hired by a uber wealthy, handsome, young bachelor who is not spoiled at all by his silver spoon that he was born with (yet who could not resist hiring a girl who was sticking her bum into his face at the interview table). And then MIRACULOUSLY her writing becomes a big hit and of course her knight in shining armor falls for her. Do we need more of this non-sense? Cindrella syndrome is in every woman including myself but not this far, not in this way. Becky has no distinctive character like Elle Woods from Legally Blonde or Cher in Clueless. The acting is mediocre at best failing miserably bringing out the characters in any possibly believable way and I personally think Isla Fisher tried way too hard to look cute.

3768357,1,B001QOGXUA,"I never read the book, and wanted to see this movie only because I am a fan of Isla Fisher and wanted to see how she handled her first major starring role.  I'm sure Isla did the best she could with what she was given to work with, so my love for her is only slightly tarnished.  The fact is that NO actress could have made her character tolerable.  The true culprits here are the idiot director and screenwriters, who crafted a character who is impossible to root for and then presented her in a way that makes Saturday morning cartoons look like the height of cinematic sophistication.

Rebecca likes to shop because it fulfills her in some vague way.  Since all we know about her past is that she grew up middle class with a mother who liked saving money by purchasing things that would last instead of frilly expensive things that wouldn't, and commits the apparently cardinal sin of shopping at thrift stores and flea markets, all we can conclude is that Rebecca is a shallow person who resents not ever being rich enough to buy the sparkly crap she wanted as a kid, and hangs on to a childish dream of getting everything she wants as soon as she wants it with no regard for the consequences.  Are we really supposed to root for the success of a character who shops herself into such poverty that she must depend on her shrill friend to pay her rent, then blows off work to go and shop some more, even getting into fights with people over items she can't afford to buy anyway?  Are we really supposed to be on the side of a woman who lies constantly, to everyone around her, and acts so unprofessionally that she'd actually start sharpening a pencil during a meeting on her first day of work at a new job at a prestigious magazine?  Why would a woman like her even be USING a lead pencil and carrying her own sharpener around?  This is just one example of how unrealistic and forced the ""humor"" in this movie is.  The pencil exists so we can giggle about her interrupting the meeting, and then see how ""cute"" she is when she realizes that -- gasp! -- making that kind of noise in a meeting draws attention to you!  BAD attention!  And then to cap it all off, the first assignment she hands in is 100% plagiarized.  Not that she's fired or anything, for committing the ultimate journalistic crime.

There is no development in this movie.  We see her write one column and suddenly she's an instant success, period.  Same goes for her relationship with the male lead.  Suddenly, for no reason at all, he wants to kiss her.  And we're supposed to believe their relationship is meant to be?  Every moment of this movie is straight out of the rom-com cliche playbook, from the shrill best friend to the handsome man who forgives her for lying because he just can't resist her.  The ultimate capper was when she turns down the job she claims she always wanted at another prestigious magazine, even though she's nearly $20K in debt.  Oops, did I just spoil it for you?  Sorry, but if the rest of the movie didn't clue you in to what was about to happen in that scene, then -- Welcome!  And I hope you're enjoying your first visit to planet Earth!

The soundtrack was atrocious; apparently there wasn't enough budget to pay for original songs so they had a bunch of people re-record popular songs and used those instead.  The supporting players were also terrible.  I never thought I'd hate anything Kristen Scott Thomas or Joan Cusack did on film, but even they can't elevate this excrement.  The only extras were some un-funny bloopers and some mercifully deleted scenes, along with a music video I didn't bother to watch.  I know a lot of people's bad reviews harp on the fact that a character like this is especially egregious in financial times like the ones we're experiencing now, but as far as I'm concerned, this woman would never be redeemable no matter what era the movie was released in.

3768358,3,B001QOGXUA,"I watched this because I like Hugh Dancy and though I'm not a great fan of Isla Fisher, I decided to give the movie a chance. It's actually not too bad, entertaining in a mindless sort of way and fun escapist fare. Isla Fisher plays Rebecca Bloomwood, a journalist who aspires to work for a prestigious fashion magazine whilst struggling (though denying) her mounting credit card debt. Rebecca is addicted to high-end shopping you see, and has no control over her spending habits. A chance encounter with Hugh Dancy eventually lands her a job at Money Saving Magazine with Dancy as her boss. This is far from Rebecca's dream job but she figures she can use this stint to get to her dream job. Along the way, romantic entanglements ensue, complications arise especially with a sinister and persistent debt collector on Rebecca's trail, and her life slowly but surely falls apart.

The plot is predictable, and there is nothing remotely intellectual about this movie. It is just a light, frothy confection of a chick flick and is not meant to be taken seriously. Isla Fisher does a good job as the vivacious shopaholic and shares credible on-screen chemistry with Hugh Dancy. Recommended as a rental.",1253577600,2,1198,4.84390243902439

I've read neither of the books on which these movies are based, so that is NOT factored into my review.

My initial draw to this movie was due to the fact that I thought it MIGHT be a bit like Devil Wears Prada...a comedic insight to a NY fashion focused life.

It was anything but.

The acting was generally horrid, whatever elements of the plot that could have been funny fell totally flat...this is an instance where ALL of the funny scenes were shown in the trailer with nothing left over for the movie.

The only part of the movie that I found 'cute' was the friendship between the main character and her best friend.

I was extremely disappointed in the lack of entertainment value of this movie all around and honestly blame the director and screenwriter for screwing this up.  Maybe throw some blame the actors ways as well.

It will be a woman who tries to conscript you for this, a girlfriend, your sister, maybe even your mother.  Believe me, they will be the only ones to enjoy it and even they will forget it shortly after turning off the set. I certainly did.  Even though less than 30 days have gone by, I am having trouble remembering the silly scenes in any detail.  This is too bad in a way because Sophie Kinsella, author of the novel, is one of the freshest chick lit writers (from Britain) to hit our shores. Kinsella's novel writing about this charge card obsessed heroine was actually a lot droller, more satiric and more sharply observed than this movie version of it. Nevertheless, I did watch it until the end.  This is because Isla Fisher is cute as heroine Becky Bloomwood.  Plus having her write for a finance magazine when she is a financial disaster has its moments. Hugh Dancy plays her boss at the finance magazine and thus he is the romantic interest of the movie.  As a romantic hero, he was good.  So if you are a woman and want an evening's light entertainment, rent this on DVD or see as pay-per-view on your tv or your computer.

3768406,4,B001QOGXUA,"As a child Rebecca Bloomwood learned early that there were two kinds of prices: ""Real Prices"" which are for sparkly things with a short shelf life and ""Mom Prices"" which are for indestructible brown things. Rebecca preferred real. Her quest for top dollar resulted in twelve credit cards, $16,262.70 in debt, and a very bad credit rating. Her credit is so bad she is even hiding (literally) from a debt collector whose mission is to ruin her life.

When her dream job is filled internally she takes a job writing under the guise of ""the girl with the green scarf"" for a financial magazine owned by the same company with hopes of getting her foot in the door. She ends up becoming insanely popular with her new found popularity opening doors for her career but not everyone is as happy as she is about her success.

Confessions of a Shopaholic is an incredibly cute film; made so by Isla Fisher whose interpretation of her character is so gosh-darn-cute despite being a chronic liar. Fisher is aided by witty writing which produces many quotes that will make you nod in agreement (""Underwear is a basic human right"") or at least make you chuckle (""A man won't treat you as well as a store and you can't return him seven days later""). Notable guest stars include John Goodman, Joan Cusack and Kristen Scott Thomas; all of whom have wee roles but get a good line or two.

Confessions of a Shopaholic isn't a roll in the isles kind of movie but it is amusing and the pace moves along quickly. While the movie starts off making fun of a psychiatric disorder and some of the people who suffer with it, it redeems itself by the end wrapping up the morals in a pretty little bow.

3768407,2,B001QOGXUA,"Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher) is a young career girl who feels clothes and fashion define her.  She has credit cards and overwhelming debt, but cannot control her urge to shop. Even store mannequins speak to her, begging her to buy more.

Rebecca wants a job at a fashion magazine. However, through quirky movie luck, she inadvertently finds a job at a financial magazine giving out financial advice on how to stay out of debt.  Now this premise is funny but the movie only gives mild smiles. Isla Fisher does her best to save the movie through a free and happy personality, but can't quite do it.  The debt collector Derek Smeath (Robert Stanton) is the movie's villain and he is dodged successfully by Rebecca until she is on national TV giving out advice on savings.

The movie is ironically timely with the global meltdown about the time of release - the sins of debt revealed - and Derek Smeath is standing up for ethical and moral responsibility so it was hard to dismiss him as evil.

There is a ""I Love Lucy"" physical comedy, and look for the camera (crazy dumb redhead), but you wonder how anyone could be so dense. Rebecca is a bouncing bubbly air-head, selfish, spoiled, clothes horse,  who has no control over her finances or life. The few laughs you have are hard to come by.

I was impressed with the list of actors - all did their best - but they could not save this weak comedy:  Kristen Scott Thomas, Joan Cusack, John Goodman, John Lithgow and Luke Brandon. (Fisher also did her best, but sad script)

From the opening scenes at the funeral to the relationship break-up that occurred while the lead character was in rehab, this tale really causes the viewer to open her eyes and see the world with a fresh perspective.  I found the main love interest to be quite charming, as it is not very often that a man with thick scars on his cheeks is considered to be ""attractive.""  Yet the movie broke through stereotypes and allowed for his romance with the lead character, although it did end in tragedy after his post break-up suicide.

I was not a fan, however, of the gratuitous depictions of senseless violence, particularly towards the end of the movie.  The lead character's downward spiral into addictive self-destruction was important to the plot, but we did not need to see her repeated attempts at self-mutilation and physical abuse.  I was also highly offended by the shower scene, as I felt that it was tasteless and overly bloody.  Defecation should never be seen in a movie of this rating.

3768434,2,B001QOGXUA,"And removed all the sex, friendship, and fun, this is what would be left. Basically it's just a gorgeous girl who has an orgy with labels and credit cards. So why did I give this two stars instead of one? Simply put, Isla Fisher is freaking gorgeous (how Borat got her is beyond me). She easily beats Amy Adams as the hottest redhead in Hollywood (no meagre feat, I might add), and quite frankly, she is so beautiful to watch that I can almost look past the nonexistent script and cardboard performances. Almost. Even with such eyecandy I still want a decent story (I'm not asking for ""Citizen Kane"" here people. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" had amazing actors, a great storyline, and gorgeous scenery and wasn't too far away from the concept being presented here but was light years beyond it in presentation). Chick-lit can be witty and interesting, and it's an insult to women to present subpar stories and expect them to eat it up simply because Hollywood believe that it has figured out the female genome for viewing. It's like all of those stupid ""Van Wilder"" films which are supposed to appeal to men because drinking, partying, goofy off, and hot chicks are presented. Writers need to not be so lazy and actually come up with real thoughtout concepts instead of tired films based on beer and mall ads.
  Okay, the story: beautiful Isla is deeply in debt, living with an equally broke roommate who looks exactly like Katy Perry, comes from an overly frugal family which is why she overcompensates with constant shopping, and now finds herself out of a job. She dreams of working at the top fashion magazine in NYC (really, doesn't Hollywood believe that women have any other hopes and dreams beyond writing about insanely priced clothing made by gay designers who insist that every woman look like a 12 year old boy? I have to ask), and is on her way to interview when she is (literally) seduced by a scarf. Her cards are maxed out and she seeks extra cash at the local hot dog stand where she runs into a British hottie. She tells him a lie about her sick aunt needing the scarf and he generously gives her the money and a bit of a lecture about the worth of things. Long story short, she buys the scarf and goes to the interview where, lo and beyond, the fashion position is taken but a spot in the financial sister mag is open (oh what irony!). What is our girl to do? Of course she goes to the interview where guess who is her prospective boss but generous Brit! She tries to b.s. her way through, but obviously fails. Upset, she stays up all night drinking with her roommate and writes two letters, one to the fashion mag trying to show how bright she is and the other to our beloved Brit telling him what a twit he was. I wouldn't tell you what happens, but you can probably guess or else the film would end here.
 Along the way our lovely Isla finds herself in almost cartoon-esque situations and slowly but surely discovers what is truly valuable in life. One of the most improbable things for me about this movie was the triangle between Isla, the Brit, and some bland blonde chick who worked for the fashion mag. I'm sorry, but given the choice between gorgeous and irresistable Isla and some lifeless stick figure, is there even a debate? I never felt as if the blonde had any chance (then again, who would against Isla? Have I mentioned how beautiful she is?). I thought perhaps I wasn't the target audience so I watched this with my stepdaughter and niece and they both weren't too crazy about this film either. Script writers need to leave the ""Sex and the City"" concept alone. It worked great for that programme, but that was lightening in the bottle. The magic will not be recaptured no matter how many gorgeous women they show walking and shopping in designer stores up and down the streets of New York. I'm hoping that the antimateralistic message will catch on in these trying economic times, but I suspect that all this film will inspire is for more women to go to their local salons in an attempt to achieve Ms. Fisher's glorious mane.

3768436,2,B001QOGXUA,"""Confessions of a Shopaholic""  is a broad comedy about consumerism gone mad -- hardly a timely movie in an economic environment in which belts are being tightened.  Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher) has finally reached the outer limits of her credit cards and owes $16,000.  To pay for her elaborate wardrobe, she has to get a job.  Her dream job is a position at New York's top fashion magazine, ""Alette,"" but she has to settle for a desk at ""Successful Saving,"" a struggling financial magazine owned by the same publishing company.  Dogged by a persistent debt collector (Robert Stanton), Becky becomes the unlikely author of a column on saving money.  Her unconventional outlook on money matters attracts the approval of her boss (Hugh Dancy), and a contrived romance results.
 Though Ms. Fisher has charm, the movie looks like remnants of other, better comedies have been sewn together into a patchwork quilt.  There are especially large ""borrowings"" from ""Legally Blonde"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada.""  John Goodman, Joan Cusack, and Kristen Scott Thomas are wasted in small roles as Becky's father, mother, and editor of ""Alette,"" respectively.

I was incredibly disappointed at the movie adaptation,.  They compiled elements from Confessions of a Shopaholic, Shopaholic takes Manhatten and Shopaholic ties the Knot, thereby eliminating any sequel possibility.

Patricia Field nailed the fashions in this movie. And I just love New York, I won't be complaining about the change of location (don't get me wrong I also love London but I really prefer New York when it comes to the shopping. It being THE Fashion Capital of the world and all).

On the other side of the spectrum the DVD was the total oppossite. Here's the low down on this DVD set. The film was crystal clear but my only concern were the Bonus Features. They didn't put any interviews or behind the scenes extras on it,so I was a little pissed. That's the whole point of buying a DVD set so that you have that insider perspective on how the film was made, interviews with the author Sophie and the cast etc... Even the Gag Reel was too short and the videoscreen of the music video ""Stuck with Each Other"" was so distracting that it takes your eyes off the video.

The entire exposition is centered around explaining this girl to those who do not have a job or a credit card--i.e., children. And yet, it is the last thing I'd want a child to see. All we see is an over-energized cliche-quipping machine, who constantly lies cheats and steals and runs around behind people's backs to get whatever she wants while clowning around in exaggerated ways (clearly the accompanying clowning is why we're supposed to find it funny). I was exhausted just watching the jerky overacting after about 15 minutes. It might have worked, anyway, since it is only mimicking the teenage/young adult dilemma of trying to have adult privileges without fully understanding adult responsibilities. Except that they had to make her be constantly saved from her stupid behavior by a particular male's ingenuity instead of figuring it out herself, like any normal person. And all of the plot devices are totally impractical - like, she refuses a job with a fashion magazine at his advice supposedly because she's addicted to clothes and spending money, when in reality working for that magazine, she'd get the clothes for free and would be able to use her paycheck to pay off the credit cards - the smart solution. Instead she does the dumb thing and spends more money and needs to be saved by this guy again.

I'm writing my review from cluelessness over how the story played out in the book and without comparison between book and film.

I loved this movie. Aside from a handful of a-words, several oh God's, I believe an s-word and a scene of a couple in bed (just there, not doing anything) this is a clean and charming movie. A scene of credit card bill totaling performed while tossing back shots of tequila ended up being a bad idea when a wrong letter is mailed to the wrong person -- which could make for a great discussion opener on the consequences of drinking. I think I can recommend it for family viewing, not only because of what it lacks (sex and over the top innuendo and crudeness) but for what it portrays. The main character (Fischer) has a big problem that she has to come to grips with once her life falls down around her darling half-off boots. She struggles and lies and makes some really poor choices but sucks it up and chooses to grow up, becoming an excellent and charming role model in the process.

Isla Fisher is an expressive  actress and her character Rebecca Bloomwood reminded me of Elle from Legally Blonde, a smart-cookie bubblehead with a big, sweet heart. Hugh Dancy is aw-shucks with a British accent hunky. The elements of romance aren't totally believable, this is chick-lit translated to chick-flick after all, but sweet and fun. The plot line has predictability since it follows those genre guidelines. A lot of physical humor, some fun special effects (talking/gesturing mannequins), and lots of color and textures make it visually appealing.  We rented it because my daughter wanted to see it. I liked Confessions so much that I watched it a second time when she invited friends over to view it. Out of four picky females and one male, the consensus was that there will be some copies purchased for personal film libraries, including us, we will be buying this movie.

Bottom line. If you've read the book, keep looking at reviews to determine if this novel to film will work for you. If you haven't read it and are looking for a fun, sweet film reminiscent of Legally Blonde, you could do far worse.",1247097600,12,2374,4.60047281323877

3768526,2,B001QOGXUA,"I have enjoyed reading Sophie Kinsella's book as a form of escapism.  I also have listened to the audiobooks on car trips.

When I read the blurb about the movie, ""Confessions of a Shopaholic,"" I was surprised at how different it was, compared to the book.  Not many movies stay true to the books they are based on, but this one is totally not even close to the plot of the book.  I love romantic comedies, but this one just bored me to death.  I have to admit that I did not make it through the second half of the movie.

My complaints are as follows:  not set in London (so no British accent), many names are changed from the book, there is more background in the book about Becky's spending habits.  She doesn't just buy clothes, she buys as sorts of stuff she doesn't need.  Roles are moved around.  In the book, Luke owns his company and Alicia is a PR person; in the movie, Luke is Rebecca's boss and Alicia works at a magazine.

The whole point of Rebecca and love-interest Luke meeting was through her job at a personal finance magazine and Luke's company does PR for financial companies.

I won't bore you with more complaints.  If you want to see this movie, get it from your library or borrow it from someone.  Not worth purchasing the DVD.

I gave it two stars only for the cool clothes.",1246924800,2,1299,4.331950207468879

Like me, Rebecca Bloomwood (played by Isla Fisher) loves to shop. However, she buys things with money she does not have. This weakness buries her in debt. People she owes start sending her hate mail, calling her at all hours, and one really creepy debt collector even stalks her. So, what's a poor little shopaholic to do? Seek intervention. Becky's attempts at retail rehab bring about hilarious results. I enjoyed this movie very much. Still, I found certain elements of the movie rather predictable, especially when I first saw her young, good-looking boss played by Hugh Dancey. I just KNEW the second I saw them together that they would be an item by movie's end. So unrealistic. Nonetheless, the movie as a whole was very entertaining. Many reviewers seem to feel as though the movie glorifies materialism. I feel that the movie's actual moral is to ultimately show just how unimportant material possessions actually are. This, if you ask me, is quite reassuring in these trying economic times. I'd like to end this review by reminding you that most movies, especially comedies like this one, are not meant to be taken seriously. They are meant to provide the viewer with mindless fun. So, those of you who are down on this one due to the present economic situation need to take a chill pill and just enjoy. Life's too short. Confessions Of A Shopaholic is a light-hearted flick with a very talented cast, the lively setting of New York City (America's fashion capital), and a thought-provoking message. See it soon.

But if the only thing you are going to walk away with from the original story is the names of the characters, the title for the film and like one accurate scene that correlates with the book, then why bother with basing it on the book in the first place?

Don't get me wrong, sometimes the movies bring the books alive (I still haven't found that yet, but I'm trying to be reasonable), but if you're going to rewrite the entire thing....I just don't get it. And its not even funnier or better!  That would be justifiable, I guess, but its hard to improve on the real thing since Kinsella is brilliant.  This was a disaster!

Becky is a normal person, in a job she doesn't like and she has a shopping problem.  She isn't a ditz like they portray in the movie.  She has always worked for a financial magazine and you don't get the impression she dresses like a twelve year old playing dress-up with her mother's clothes.

The book is funny, the story is funny and believable.  Why switch everything around?  It wasn't funny.  And why couldn't they leave it set in England? I don't get that switch either.  It would have worked better the way it was originally written, as Becky uncovers fraud at a major banking institution......gee, sound familiar?  At least the book shows that she's not stupid just oblivious to her talents (aside from finding a sale).

HUGH DANCY is great, funny (with what little they give him to work with) and I feel the talented cast could not salvage this movie.  Read the books they are classics and you will understand the characters and situations better, as well as laugh incessantly!  Why can't they just stick with what works?

And while I enjoyed the performances of Isla Fisher as Becky Bloomwood and Hugh Dancy as her boss/love-interest, as usual, the translation to film left out some of what made these books fabulous.

For one thing, taking snippets from each book and trying to position everything into one feature--well, there is just so much you can do in a couple of hours of movie production.

But, to give the film its due, choosing Isla Fisher as Becky was ""spot on,"" as the British say.  She is charming, delightful, and after watching her for awhile, you forget that the film is not really as much like the books as you might hope.

3768574,5,B001QOGXUA,"I saw this movie without reading the book first and I loved it.  Isla Fisher is HILARIOUS as Rebecca Bloomwood and she is definitely  an actress to watch out for.  Isla plays the part of Rebecca, a shopaholic trying to avoid a debt collector, extremely well.  She makes Rebecca seem cute, innocent, funny, smart, and of course, fashionable.

Read with caution, as I may have basically the whole movie written down here:
The story of this movie is basically that when shopaholic Rebecca Bloomwood (how fun is it to say that?) is left without a job, she goes to work at a finance magazine called Successful Saving, hoping to use that to get to where she really wishes to be: Alette, a fashion magazine.  Rebecca advises people on how to use their money and as she uses her own shopping experiences to write her articles, Rebecca gains much popularity and becomes known as ""The Girl in the Green Scarf"".  Rebecca also falls in love with her boss, Luke Brandon.  There is a dancing scene relating to this in the movie that had me crying from laughing so hard, it was that funny.

All the action happens while Rebecca, with the help of her loyal friend Suze, tries desperately to avoid Derek Smeath, a debt collector intent on getting back the thousands that Rebecca owes.  It is hilarious to watch Rebecca as she makes up dozens of excuses, (I broke my leg, my aunt is in the hospital, my aunt fell out of a skydiving accident, I'm in Finland) attempting to avoid this man.

After watching the movie, I read the book and I understand why there are people unhappy with the movie.  The movie is very different from the book, but it is in no way less enjoyable.  The plots of both the movie and the book are still very good and the movie still attains the fun spirit of the book.
This movie is sweet, it is funny, and it will make you smile.  The music of this movie is the perfect soundtrack to Rebecca Bloomwood's story and the fun music adds to the enjoyment of the movie.  I recommend this movie for a for a friends night or if you just want to have some good, simple fun. You will not be disappointed!",1246147200,11,2099,4.415584415584416
3768575,4,B001QOGXUA,"I have read and loved the complete Shopaholic series and was looking forward to seeing the movie. What I have learned over the years, is when a book/author gets a movie deal the directors and producers take alot of creative license with their project...which equals = dissapointing. So while I sit down comfortably on my couch and play with the remote control, I psyched my self up into seperating the movie from the book...you need to do this else you won't enjoy the movie for what it is and you'll start picking out scenes they missed and pick at scenes that were added, and be upset that they made her a New Yorker and not from London. She was never in Miami in the book..I could go on . The truth is they ( the powers that be ) use the books as a guide. We all need to remember this, it's important if you ever want to see your favorite books made into movies again and enjoy them.
I found this movie a feast on the eyes with all the beautiful fashion. fell in love with the characters all over again and laughed ..alot( remember the book is a guide ) Loved the scene when she tried to pay for the green scarf with cash and several different credit cards and the  last card was declined and she ran up to a hotdog vender for cash back if she bought one hotdog.( her soon to be future boss ended up giving her a $20.00 bill after a long drawn out excuse about an aunt )she got her scarf. Loved the credit card in ice and the dept collecter on the hunt for her ( almost catching up with her a few times )that she felt she had to tell her boss somthing...so she came up with a last minute excuse that he was an ex boyfriend who is stalking her and they had him escorted out of the building.

I enjoyed 'Prada' but 'Confessions' was a really poor 'wannabe' in comparison.  There were times when I had to leave the room as they telegraphed the embarrassing comedy moment far in advance.

3768578,4,B001QOGXUA,"Sophia Kinsella (a pen name for writer Madeline Wickham) is known for her ""Shopaholic"" novels which have been a hit in the UK.  Having published a total of five novels,  Touchstone Pictures and Jerry Bruckheimer Films has a film based on the first two novels (""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" and ""Shopaholic Takes Manhattan) released back in 2001 and 2002.

Taking on the directorial reigns of the film is P.J. Hogan (""My Best Friends Wedding"") and a screenplay by writers Tracey Jackson (""The Other End of the Line""), Tim Firth (""Calendar Girls"") and Kayla Alpert (who produced many episodes for the TV series ""Ally McBeal"").  Music for the film is by James Newton Howard (""The Sixth Sense"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Primal Fear"", etc.) and cinematography by Jo Willems (""30 Days of Night"" and ""Rocket Science"").

The film would feature many all-star talents which include Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"", ""Definitely, Maybe"" and ""The Lookout""), Hugh Dancy (""Black Hawk Down"", ""Ella Enchanted"" and ""Basic Instinct 2'), Krysten Ritter (""Frost"", ""27 Dresses"" and ""Gilmore Girls""),  Joan Cusack (""War, Inc."", ""Say Anything"", ""The School of Rock"" and ""Chicken Little""), John goodman (""Rosanne"", ""Cars and ""Bee Movie""), John Lithgow (""Dexter, ""Dreamgirls"" and ""3rd Rock from the Sun"") and Kristin Scott Thomas (""The Golden Compass"", ""Mission Impossible"" and ""I Loved You So Long"").

The film revolves around Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher), a writer for a gardening magazine who lives with her friend Suze (Krysten Ritter) and is known for her overuse of her credit cards (around a dozen of them) which she constantly uses in order to purchase the latest designer clothing in Manhattan. Her shopping habits are obsessive and to the point that her debt is just incredibly high and she has bills that have not been opened and unpaid.  Needless to say, she's in financial trouble but yet continues to shop like there's no tomorrow.

As a child, Rebecca has always been enamored by clothes but due to her fiscally conservative parents, always had to get the cheaper clothing and now as an adult, only wants the best.  Her goal is to work for her favorite fashion magazine ""Alette"" but finds out during the interview that Editor Alette Naylor (Kristin Scott Thomas) has hired socialite Alicia Billington (Leslie Bibb) for the job.

But instead of sulking about not getting the job, Rebecca receives good information from the office assistant that ""Successful Saving"" is hiring and because its part of the same family that publishes ""Alette"", she can work her way to the top.  So, Rebecca interviews for the position and is interviewed by new editor Luke Brandon (Hugh Dancy) who tries to learn more about her financing skills.  Having really no experience, she fumbles her way during the interview and claiming she knows about finance and that she knows Finnish (which she doesn't know at all).

While returning back to her regular job, she finds out that her job is folding their business and without a job, she will be unable to pay her credit card bills.  And because she has maxed out may of them and doesn't make all that much, she continually receives a message from debt collector Derek Smeath (Robert Stanton).

While her friend Suze tries to get her focused on paying her bills and getting Rebecca to take responsibility for her debt, the two get drunk and she accidentally sends a letter with a sample story to Luke Brandon, while accidentally sending the letter mean for Luke to Allete Magazine.

She receives a call a few days later from Luke that hew as impressed by the story and is hired to be a writer at ""Succesful Saving"".  Using her knowledge of shopping, she utilizes her skill as a writer and uses the name of ""The Girl in the Green Scarf"".  Her article becomes a success and makes the fledgling financial magazine to become a hit.

But with her debt collector doing what he can to get his money from Rebecca, and Rebecca having to wing a lie that she knows about finance, will she be able to keep this charade up for long?  And to make things worse, will her shopaholic mindset hurt her as she continues to pile debt?

""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" is released on Blu-ray with 2-discs.  The first disc features the film and special features while the second disc features a digital copy of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" is featured in 1080p with an aspect ratio of (2:40:1).  If there is one thing that caught my attention about ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"", the film tries to showcase many vibrant colors.  So, there are many scenes that just looks quite gorgeous.  For the most part, the majority of the film receives another solid transfer but there are some scenes that do have quite a bit of grain and also, some scenes that tend to overdo it with the color of red and amber colors.  But overall, the picture quality of ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" is very good and considering Touchstone is part of Disney, all Blu-ray releases from their various companies have all been solid.

As for audio, ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) and also in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film actually does a great job by use of panning audio from speaker to speaker but for the most part, the film is front and center channel heavy.  Dialogue is clear and for this film, one of the big factors in audio is the utilization of music.  There is some good LFE bass when it comes to music being used and overall, the soundtrack comes alive.  From the busy shops, to the sample sales in which you can hear the women fighting over clothing but it's the music that I was impressed with how alive it was and setting a stylish pace for this film.

As for subtitles, English SDH, French and Spanish is offered.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" comes with a few short features featured in 1080p or 480i, English 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital and English SDH, French and/or Spanish subtitles.  Included are:

JUDGMENT CALL:

I tend to enjoy many films that utilizes fashion and designer clothing into the film.  So, I had high hopes for ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" because it was a fun and stylish looking film.  In fact, for the most part, I did enjoy the film as we know that the character of Rebecca Bloomwood would eventually be caught for her lying and that there would be a cost or some type of way she would learn about her obsessive shopping habits.

But the problem with the film are the numerous farfetched and contrive plots.  You would think that a financial magazine would hire a writer based on a strong financial portfolio.  Then there's the debt collector and we get to see how far a debt collector would go.  Granted, some debt collectors are known for their slimy tactics but in this film, it takes things to a new level.

In a way, two things that work against the comedy is unfortunately, in a bad economy, where people are depending on their credit cards or other ways for money for survival, you have a character who has a dozen credit cards that she doesn't use for survival but for buying expensive designer brand merchandise.  Second, where you hope to see an empowered woman at the end becomes a woman who is just too ditsy to even think of a professional working for a major finance magazine.  As farfetched some plots were in the film, how this character is redeemed is again, too over-the-t0p.

Granted, ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" is a romantic comedy but at least with a ""DEVIL WEARS PRADA"", there is a likable woman who gets caught up in the fashion world but through pain, becomes a stronger.  Even, ""Legally Blonde"" had some redeeming factors with the main character.

With two novels being covered in the first film, sometimes I wonder how much storyline from the novels were actually skipped in the film adaption.  Having not read any of the novels, was Rebecca Bloomwood like this throughout the two novels?  Was their redemption for her character?

I also felt that perhaps the film could have used the talent (and there are a good number of well-known talent) a bit more wisely.

As for the Blu-ray release, so far anything related to Disney that has been released in High Definition have all been solid.  ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" is a film where color plays a primary part in the film and this film is quite colorful and vibrant.  The audio is fun and for all films that utilize fashion, the music soundtrack plays a big part and in this case, music plays a very big part in ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"".  I enjoyed the use of audio especially how my subwoofer started working in tandem with the front speakers for certain songs.  So, that was cool to see!  Also, I was quite happy to see a digital copy included with this release.

Despite the number of special features included on the Blu-ray disc, I was surprised that there was no in depth behind-the-scenes featurette.  Most of the special features included are quiet short and are at under two minutes.

""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" starts off very well in its first half but somehow, unfortunately, the over-the-top situations start to make things a bit too farfetched and contrived for my tastes and the overall storyline was a bit predictable.  But by no means is the film a bad.  There's no denying that filming in New York City has given this film such beauty and the overall fashion presentation makes this film quite stylish and cool.

In the end, ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" was an enjoyable popcorn flick which you can enjoy for its crazy humor, stylish presentation and its crazy characters.  Isla Fisher is absolutely charming and fun but its probably best to watch this romantic comedy without being serious minded.

But as long as you enjoy its craziness, you'll find ""CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC"" to be quite entertaining and fun!

3768579,2,B001QOGXUA,"I haven't read the author Sophie Kinsella's original series, but I believe Rebecca of the books is a totally different person from the heroine of this Hollywood adaptation with such an ordinary story. It is hard to believe that ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" is directed by P. J. Hogan who actually made edgy ""Muriel's Wedding"" about 15 years ago.

""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" follows the life of a college graduate Rebecca Bloomwood (Isla Fisher) hoping to write for a fashion magazine. Being a ""shopaholic"" or compulsive shopper, however, and unable to resist the urge to buy (with 12 credit cards in her purse), Rebecca is in debt, so she applies for the job as writer for a financial magazine. There she meets a handsome (and incredibly patient) editor Luke (Hugh Dancy) and becomes a successful columnist under the pen name of ""The Girl with the Green Scarf."" This is highly implausible, you might say, but the real problem is something else.

The screenplay of ""Confessions"" is a good showcase of romantic comedy clich&eacute; - from the heroine making mistakes and realizing it later, to her best friend getting married and slightly eccentric but understanding parents. In fact, despite the central topic that could be very serious, the film's script is just a concoction of ordinary ideas, among which capable cast is wasted, including Joan Cusack and John Goodman as the heroine's parents as well as Kristin Scott Thomas sporting French accent. Costume designer is Patricia Field (""The Devil Wears Prada,"" with which the film shares some storyline), and perhaps her work is one of the few reasons that you should watch this film.

Some heroines in movies or TV series are loved by the audiences because of their flaws. The flawed heroine of ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" is desperately trying to be that and succeeds to some extent thanks to the star Isla Fisher, but with no visible chemistry between her and Hugh Dancy, and the run-of-the-mill screenplay, she has no chance from the beginning.",1245974400,,2005,4.979104477611941

3768581,4,B001QOGXUA,"Many of the reviews of this DVD are from females, who are, of course, the target audience for both the book the film was based on , as well as the movie.

Well, I don't fit that mould, being a male and being much older that, again, the target audience. But I really did enjoy the film. No, I wasn't impressed by the fashion statements being made (I wouldn't know a Prada from an Old Navy in most cases.) but I liked the ""corporate politics"" angle and was anxious to see what Ilsa Fisher would do, having only seen her in ""the Wedding Crashers"" and remembering her acting there as being more sexual than character building. In this film she reminded me of Renee Zellweger in ""Bridget Jones Diary"". Of course, there were other similarities here as well. The now requisite British (or in some cases Australian) male love interest (substitute Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman) in ""Confessions""  is played by Hugh Dancy.

As a summer movie this does okay. It's not great art but a fun flick. The bonus features are not much. They are short.

It'll be interesting to see where Fisher's career goes next!

Isla Fisher WAS really good in this movie, and I hope she begins to get a couple more movies where she is a leading lady.  Naturally funny, Isla pulls off the Becky Bloomwood character very well.

Being the fashion addict that I am, I also loved the fact that Patrcia Field(costume stylist for Sex and the city and Devils wears Prada)worked her magic here. I'm a huge fan of hers and her entertaining style choices never fail to amaze me! The guy she falls for is actually very cute and I love the parts with them in Miami, flirting against the backdrop of the beautiful city. If you're a girly girl like me who loves chick flicks and fashion, this is your movie!",1245801600,,738,4.556390977443609
3768595,3,B001QOGXUA,"Rebecca Bloomwood loves to shop, shop, shop!  It doesn't matter if she doesn't really need it--if it's there, and it's cute, then she's got to have it.  I mean, the gorgeous green scarf on sale turned out to be her best investment, for she is now The Girl in the Green Scarf -- columnist for Successful Saving.  Now, a girl with past due credit card bills, and a collection agent stalking her, has no business giving financial advice, but this job is only a stepping stone for a much-coveted position in Allette (sp?), THE fashion magazine.  But her current job has its perks; she's become quite a celebrity columnist and her hot editor is an added bonus.  But will her career climb take a big dive when her secret addiction is discovered?

The movie bears a vague resemblance to Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series.  None of the stuff above actually happened in the books.  But the character is just as perky and the plot just as fun and entertaining.  Isla Fisher is perfect as Rebecca.  She is cute, spunky and funny.  And Hugh ""Be Still My Heart"" Dancy is wonderful as Luke Brandon.  (Funny, Luke is not a magazine editor in the books but the CEO of a big PR firm.)  He is a great actor, not to mention totally hot.  The blu-ray is pretty good, but don't know if it's a keeper or not.  People will no doubt identify with Rebecca and her urges to shop when she's supposed to be saving money to pay off her debts, especially with the current financial crisis in this country.  Some parts of the movie throw reality out the window.  For instance, Becky claims she speaks Finnish, so she's introduced to a Finnish business type.  Even though it is obvious she doesn't understand a word he says and even slaps him for supposedly hitting on her, he tells Luke that he likes her!  Yeah, okay.  Alas, it's just a movie, a darn good ""night with the girls"" type of flick, so make some popcorn, mix up some cocktails and enjoy.",1245801600,,1920,4.478386167146974
3768596,5,B001QOGXUA,"I absolutely loved this movie! I saw it the weekend it was realeased and could not wait for it to be released on dvd. It will definitely make you laugh out loud! I thought the plot was very original and just hilarious.  Also behind all the fashions and loads of laughs makes you think about how you spend your money and consequences of it. But overall, it deserves an A for laughs, fun and originality. A movie that will definitely put a smile on your face and in your heart if you don't already have one! I can't wait till next week for its dvd realease!",1245024000,8,555,4.235849056603773
3768597,5,B001QOGXUA,"Shop until you die - this was what exactly Isla Fisher did in the movie Confessions of a Shopaholic. With the recession still not going away tomorrow, this movie is very educational.  Plus the very pretty Isla Fisher and nice clothing will make this movie the most memorable for those that love to shop.

Shop until you die?  No shop till you are dead!  Long live shopaholics!

And shopping does make the world better for a while.  Isla Fisher is so likeable and the Shopaholic meetings were especially funny.  All in all, this movie is full of great performances, beautiful clothes and important life lessons.",1244764800,6,366,4.640625
3768599,5,B001QOGXUA,"I love this movie. I needed a little pick me up and it was the medicine that I needed. If I don't buy another movie I am going to get this one. I love the actor and actress in this movie. Love it! Love it! I am really surprised that the rating for this movie is a three, it really should be a five! It really is a great movie that will make you feel better.",1244505600,7,357,3.710526315789474
3768600,3,B001QOGXUA,"I read the book so the movie was a bit of a disappointment in that the book was somewhat chopped (hate that it wasn't set in England - why do all things have to take place in New York?!), and I think it kind of combined the first two books of the series into one. There was not much character build of anyone really except Becky and partly of Luke, and I didn't feel the bond of friendship between Becky and Suze like I did when I read the book.

The shopping aspect was well played, but in the book, even though Becky comes off as annoying at times, she redeems herself and becomes a loveable character. The movie's Becky was certainly cute and very funny and silly (love the fan dance), but I didn't think she became as loveable as she should have been so that the audience would really want to root for her to come out on top. She seemed more crazed and out of control than I remember in the story.

The Luke Brandon character was good, played by Hugh Dancy. He was charming and attractive and took on being a hero to Becky quite well. By the way, I love Hugh Dancy.

I wish the movie had been just like the book (but that never happens much anymore really), so I appreciate it for what it is...I'll still buy the DVD.",1244073600,,1221,4.165254237288136
3768601,2,B001QOGXUA,"I am a big fan of the 'Shopaholic' books.  So I was very excited to hear they were making a movie based on the book series.  However, i feel that the film tried too hard to condense the highlights of the first two books into this film.  I don't think enough time was spent developing the characters of Rebecca Bloomwood and Luke Brandon.  The film didn't flow nicely the way the books did.  I feel they would have done better if they focussed on one book and did a faithful adaptation.  Since they insisted on having the movie take place in New York then they should have focussed more on the second book in the series, 'Shopaholic Takes Manhattan.'
While the script wasn't great, Isla Fisher was cute and Hugh Dancy was perfectly cast as Luke Brandon.  This film is a case where the talent was great, but the story was not.",1242518400,,824,4.381578947368421
3768602,4,B001QOGXUA,"Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy are very intelligently cast and a lively pair in moral contrast in this amazingly fun movie. Slightly reminiscent of Bridget Jones, some of the scenes of her klutziness are a little overdone, but that flaw aside, this movie is highly amusing and alot of fun to watch. Her high fashion costumes are a visual feast, adding to its overall entertainment value.",1241827200,2,383,4.818181818181818

8336116,5,B001QOGXUA,"I was desperately scrolling through Amazon movies, convinced that there were no comedies left worth watching, when I came across 'Confessions of an Alcoholic'.  I saw the high ratings, watched the trailer and gave it a try.  So many comedies are nothing more than famous people doing inane slapstick or lowbrow jokes that can't amuse anyone older than a teenager.  Not so with this movie.  It belongs alongside Clueless and Bridesmaids.  The best part of this movie is that it involves the truth about a serious issue:  addiction, but the writers know how to raise it up to laughter without diminishing the issue itself.  That's what adds warmth and depth to the film, rounding the otherwise very funny lines.  The main actors are relatively unknown which makes it even better- sometimes when we know the comedian too well, we come to expect a style from them which can distract from the comedy.  This movie doesn't suffer in that way.  (The parents are famous actors, however, but they don't play a big role.)  It has a beautiful rhythm to it into which you can relax and just enjoy. I'd never heard of this movie so for me, it was an unexpected sleeper!  Thanks, Amazon!",1523923200,3,1172,4.719211822660099
