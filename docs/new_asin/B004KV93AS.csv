4398316,3,B004KV93AS,"The movie starts out with a woman and child being killed and eaten by shape-shifting hyenas. The first thing you will notice is that the faces of the hyenas move about as much as a rubber mask with red lights in the eye sockets. There is a first person narration by Briggs (Maxie J. Santillan Jr.) sitting by a camp fire talking in the past tense to fill in plot points they didn't have time to film. His narration seems to have been written for Tony Todd, which they most likely couldn't afford. Crazy Briggs is able to convince Gannon (the man's who family was killed) that it was shape-shifting hyenas who did it. (In this movie we find out snipes don't really exist.) The sound track was awful as it seems to have been taken from a TV movie.

Within a few movie time minutes they have become seasoned veterans who are now being hunted by the hyenas and they have a partner who has a BMW that won't start (imagine that). It seems the ""alpha female"" is dying which is why they are coming after the hunters, a connection I didn't grasp.

""B"" movie queen and silicon lover Christa Campbell plays a shape-shifter. She is the one that has to remove her skimpy top before changing.

There is a subplot of townies vs. Mexicans, involving a blond girl and her brother. They manage to bark out dialouge and acting usually reserved for an Asylum film production.

Amanda Aardsma with a  gaunt Susan Dey face plays Valerie, a woman saved by Briggs and Gannon who parades around in undies and a tank top.

The movie has its predictable twist and ending.

No f-bombs that I recall. The nudity which the box claims exists, looks more like body suits designed to make one look naked. The movie was poorly written and directed thanks to Eric Weston, but better than most Asylum productions.",1312934400,2,1777,4.5
4398317,2,B004KV93AS,"Gannon's wife and baby are brutally murdered and eaten along a lonely stretch of highway, and the police are powerless to find out the truth or stop the killings.  It is only after he is approached by an eccentric ""hunter"", does he realize the awful truth and vows revenge...

""Hyenas"" is one of those films that you see on the shelf or you see the trailer, and you immediately say to yourself  ""That's gonna suck"", but the creeping curiosity and novelty of it being a werehyena film keeps echoing in your mind until you actually do rent or buy it.  For me, I was very skeptical, but when I watched it, I didn't hate it, and I actually found some merit in what it was trying to present even though it was no doubt a substantially flawed film.

First off, to a casual horror fan, odds are you won't like this film.  It just has too much working against it to even compare to other good Indie horror movies.  So unless you have a soft spot for B-movies in general, or a slight inclining towards ""were"" or shapeshifting films, you can stop reading now.  For you dedicated fans of werewolf films, fans of therianthropy, or other more accepting horror buffs, you may find some enjoyment if you check this film out.  Maybe.  No, don't expect it to blow your socks off, and don't expect it to be anything more than it is---a low budget horror flick.  Don't even expect it to be good, more-so than it is passable.  But what is unique about this film; and its primary saving grace, is, it's about werehyenas, not the overused and barely done right werewolves.  So that factor in-and-of-itself gives this film something new compared to the mainstream, and it was a refreshing leg up to see.

Another thing I appreciated, was, the werehyenas were cryptid human/animals.  They were not magical or supernatural, but biological.  They could only make more of their kind through natural childbirth by at least one parent who passed down the recessive trait, but they could not turn normal people into werecreatures by biting or scratching a surviving victim.  They could also be killed in any normal manner just like anything else.

And finally, the hyenas are capable of a bipedal human/animal hybrid form.  During most of the film when people transform, they do so into relatively ""normal"" looking quadruped hyenas.  But in the second half we do see a dedicated bipedal hybrid form.  (More on that in a second.)

Most of the special effects are CGI, and it's frustrating because in some scenes (not including stock wildlife footage) it looks like the hyenas are absolutely real and they had trained animals on the set, but in other scenes, they look painfully fake.  It's like they ran out of money halfway through the post-filming visualization rendering.  All the transformation scenes are the typical morphing CGI, but thankfully we also get prosthetics and makeup---and most importantly, the hybrid human/animal version of the werehyena is all makeup and prosthetics, but done in a minimal way that works.  No baggy fur suit, no cheap mask.  It's mostly body paint, with prosthetics mostly glued on the face, head, and hands.  And like with the film ""War Wolves"", the hybrid form are more geared to be humanoid with animal characteristics, rather than animals with human characteristics.  These creatures are scavenger hunters, and they have to share a kill with a large pack (around 15 - 20 members), so they are skinny and lean, and probably underfed by having to share meals and not being able to kill humans as much as they would like.  The full-body painting accomplishes two goals: first, it give the illusion of a pelt on the humanoid body, but just with very short fur.  Second, it maintains the illusion that everyone is underfed and lanky.  I'm not sure if this was intended or not, but it works to maintain that conceit.  (And the females in the hybrid form actually look kind'a ""cute"" in a weird, feral way.)  Now, granted I'm a huge fan of werecreatures done in a non-CGI style.  I prefer highly detailed practical costumes styled like those in the original  ""Howling"" or ""Dog Soldiers"" because it looks more real, but if the producers didn't have the budget to do something that elaborate, then I'm glad they went with the bodypainting/prostheses  route, because it still conveyed the look or a transformed person, just without the hokieness of a bad fitting suit.

Unfortunately there are plenty of negatives that offset the positives:

My main gripe is about the about the plot.  Things were very predictable, so I won't even go there.  However, I will mention the plot is essentially composed of four sub-plots moving along at the same time: a grizzled hunter telling the tale to us by breaking the fourth wall,  a man seeking revenge on the pack for killing his family, the impending death of matriarchal Alpha of the pack (and the new potential Alphas' battle for succession), and a turf rivalry between Latino and White gangs---or better put, wannabe gangs.  All of these plots are linked together and are resolved in a somewhat haphazard but marginally satisfactory manner at the end, but too much time is spread between them, so we don't get anything really substantial.  Instead, it's frustrating glimpses or cut and pasted anecdotes in which we're supposed to fill in the gaps with our suspension of disbelief, because the film doesn't have time to do it.

The subplot with the two gangs could have easily been removed.  And while certain members play a role at the end, the majority was mindless posturing and some of the film's weakest acting. This whole sub-plot did nothing to move the basic monster plot forward, and all the pivotal characters could have been used in a better way that didn't distract from the main goal of this being at heart, a ""creature feature"".

I also thought all the scenes in which Crazy Briggs (the hunter) is sitting around a campfire talking to us and breaking the fourth wall could have been cut.  He's okay as a hunter inside the fiction, but not when he looks us in the eyes and addressees the audience.  That's when he becomes cheesy and almost a joke.  There weren't that many scenes, but still, it was wholly unacceptable.  There were a few instances in which it looked like it was just a fake-out trick leading us to believe he was being cheesy and breaking the fourth wall, but in reality there were actually people off camera that he was talking to that we'd eventually see.  But nope, when the camera pans, it's just Crazy Briggs indeed talking to us as if we were there.

There was even an absolutely terrible, TERRIBLE scene in which a redneck hick who makes Cooter from ""The Dukes of Hazard"" look like a Rhodes Scholar, is driving down the road and comes across one of the primary female hyenas pretending her car broke down to she can kill him.  His acting is atrocious, and his dialogue is even worse.  Any competent actor would be able to play the role---and through body movement or non-verbal acting, show the audience what is going on, but he actually advertises vocally everything he wants to do.  ""I gotta open the door to get out of my pickup.""  ""Boy, that strange woman with the tattoos standing seductively all alone on a desert highway at night is a hottie.""  ""Boy, I'd like to get into her pants became she's sexy and I now have a boner."" Not quite as shamefully blatant as that, but damn close.  It was just an awful, awful scene.  Why that was kept, or why anyone thought it was cool or funny, is beyond me.

To sum up the plot arcs: too much wasted time.  All this filler junk should have been cut out, and instead, the film's focus should have been divided between Gannon's and Crazy Briggs's hunt for revenge, and the more intimate details of the pack and their dynamics.  After all, why craft a new world with werehyenas, when you don't even explore it past the sensationalism?  (Though to be fair, we do at least get an explanation of why African spotted werehyenas are running around in the U.S..  That's probably more than many other werewolf films would give.)

My second big gripe, is, some of the characters were far too over the top, or just plain bad.  To maintain impartiality, most of the general acting was typical B-movie---not good enough for TV or real features, but better than a high school play and okay enough for the character being played to progress the plot.  Obviously some cast members were better than others, but those who were bad, were bad.  One example was already cited, but another example was some of the White gangbangers.  Nothing says poser like a tall and scrawny White guy wearing a stocking cap talking trash and acting tough, when he looks like he weighs less than a wet kitten and has skinnier arms than my sister.  Or even the leader of the White gang who's endless (ad-libbed?) pontificating is so poorly written; so badly delivered; and so unrealistic, that you can only sadly laugh because it not only embarrasses the actor, but it also embarrasses you, the viewer.  And there are a few other examples, but you get the gist of it.

It never ceases to amaze me that directors, producers, Quality Assurance people, continuity checkers, or other crew members can't see these issues as glaring problems or bad performances on the dailies, or even on the post-production videos before the CGI is added.  This movie wouldn't be half bad if the fat and tripe were cut out, but I supposed if a writer is also the director (as it is in this case with Eric Weston), they want to keep everything because it has already passed their own personal biased acceptability filter.  That, or maybe there were too many producers with their own ideas they wanted put in..?

The acting and plot constitute almost all of my gripes rolled up into one big ball.  However, the only other smaller issues I had, was, I felt the pack's composition seemed like it was based too much on the group of vampires from ""The Lost Boys"", and there was a scene at the very end that took place in an urban setting that did not need to be there.

As for recommending this, that's a pretty tough call.  Normally I'd say no.  And for me, if it was anything BUT werehyenas, I'd say no.  But it really depends on your tolerance, not mine.  The bottom line is: this film had a good idea, and it had a lot of potential.  It took things into unexplored territory in concept, but it got lost in it and had to fall back on maps others wrote for directions.  And despite its efforts, ultimately it didn't do enough to break the mold of a bad B-movie, and not enough was realized.  As a huge fan of werecreature films, I was able to suspend my disbelief just enough to watch it, and I didn't think it was as bad as it could have been---probably because I've already seen the absolute worst werewolf films ever made: ""Werewolf: The Devil's Hound"" and ""Howling: New Moon Rising"", and it's unlikely any future lycanthropy or therianthropy films can be worse than those two piles of maggot ridden feces.  So compared to those turds, anything is better.  I'm also more forgiving because I'm taking this through a therianthropy filter by appreciating the hyena angle.  So if you're like me and have a Therian side that grants allowances of tolerance, or if you look for new types of werecreatures on the screen---and you know what you're getting ahead of time (via this review), give it a shot.  Odds are, you've probably seen worse, and this is at least a film you can laugh at.  But if you aren't predisposed as a ""were"" fan, or you have higher expectations that a singular aspect such as a new werecreature type can't justify, stay clear, because you'll find no redeeming value.

(I would actually rate this 2.5 stars because to me, it fell between ""Dislike"" and ""Okay"", but since we can't do halves, I'm rounding down because there is more bad than good.)",1311033600,2,11825,4.655903614457832
4398318,3,B004KV93AS,"The most original aspect of HYENAS is the maniacal laugh of the ""hyenathropes.""  It's classically bad!
Too bad there's not much else to recommend.  You get SAW's Costas Mandylor as the typical husband/father out for revenge; busty but talentless Christa Campbell as the alpha female hyena; laughably bad special FX; and even DESIGNING WOMEN's Meschach Taylor's messianic hyena hunter.
It's all a cinematic mess but it's oddly enjoyable, one of those joyous guilty pleasures.  Just don't expect THE HOWLING and you'll be ok!",1304294400,6,523,5.27710843373494

4398322,1,B004KV93AS,"Hyenas is a weak movie, even by straight-to-video standards.  It doesn't deserve a full-length review, so here are 10 reasons why you should pass on watching it.

1. The acting is terrible, even from the actors with experience.
2. The color correction is bad, giving it that low-budget feel.
3. The CGI and special effects are downright awful.
4. The film's twist is predictable halfway through.
5. There's entirely too much weak dialogue.
6. The sub-plot involving rival teens serves no purpose.
7. The story jumps several years with no explanation.
8. There's only one scene in the film that gives it a funny, campy feel.
9. The race-based arguing in the movie was totally unnecessary.
10. Every Christa Campbell nude scene has her nipples CGI-removed.

This movie had potential.  With a better cast, better writing, improved CGI, and a campy horror feel, it could have made for a good watch.  I wouldn't even suggest renting this one through Redbox, let alone buying the DVD.",1303171200,7,978,4.903030303030303
