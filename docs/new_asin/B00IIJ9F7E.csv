6265356,5,B00IIJ9F7E,Favorite trilogy and these steel book cases are the best! Fast shipping and everything was in good condition.,1410912000,,109,5.111111111111111
6265357,4,B00IIJ9F7E,"All three of the Bourne series films with Matt Damon are excellent.  Great story lines, superb actors, and excellent characters are in the entire series.  The action is intense but not gratuitously so.  My family has probably watched this series 20 times over, and we never tired of it.",1405987200,,286,4.795918367346939

6265382,5,B00IIJ9F7E,"What an amazing series.  All in the series are highly entertaining without the need for graphice sex scenes or punctuated with foul language which, unfortunately, are the hallmark of Hollywood and a reflection of a decadent society.

I wonder why Hollywood finds it challenging producing films of this standard devoid of expletives and nudity?  Perhap producers, thinking of the box office take, need to cater for the masses of poorly educated, inarticulate folk who do punctuate their dialogue with filthy language and the word ""like"".  Common guys, let's lift the standard of script writing.",1493424000,3,593,5.276595744680851
