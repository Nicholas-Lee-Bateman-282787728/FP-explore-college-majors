4048599,5,B0031DDG9A,"The moment I heard it was from the makers of Tin Man, I marked it on my schedule. There was no way I was going to miss it.

The series was simply amazing. The characters were spot on, the plot exceptionally well made, the dialog was on point, and the scenery/computer-imaging was spectacular.

It's definitely a must-see and the perfect movie to keep on shelf. Great movie!",1260144000,,373,4.552238805970149

4048601,5,B0031DDG9A,"The critics complained that it was a crappy made-for-tv movie. Well, it certainly is NOT crappy; it's my favorite realization of Alice!",1504828800,,135,5.181818181818182
4048602,5,B0031DDG9A,"Great film, great actors, great acting. Puts a whole new spin on Alice as an adult in a dual reality. Very cool. It'll even put a smile on your face and you'll fall in love with the characters.",1503360000,,193,4.105263157894737

4048607,5,B0031DDG9A,"Loved this mini series when it first came out. Took me years to find it again. I fell hard for the hatter and not so genteel Alice. The plot in this movie is amazing! The twists and new character personalities made me love this ""new"" version of Alice and it is one of my favorite version's. i watch it alot and i reccomend it to anyone who will listen to me!!",1496534400,,359,4.070422535211268

4048609,5,B0031DDG9A,"I would watch this movie a thousand times just to see that last scene. Parts are slow, but the chemistry between the main characters is refreshing, and the supporting cast is a rainbow of talent and acting styles. Each actor's contribution helps support a story line that swerves mightily from the original while still holding on to the essence of the Alice from Lewis Carroll's books. Though it's unlikely syfy is planning a sequel, I would be up for another round of alice and her friends!",1494892800,2,491,4.72093023255814

4048611,5,B0031DDG9A,A rarity indeed for Alice fans and Carroll fanatics who insist on realism. A grown up Alice featuring Max Headroom himself- Matt Frewer who was great in that Canadian govt agent series spinoff from Cold Squad.,1494028800,,209,4.833333333333333

4048616,5,B0031DDG9A,"Love the science fiction version of Alice in wonderland! Introduced me to new actors and the ever favorite Tim Curry and Kathy Bates!!!
And how can you not love Mat Fewer as the white knight!!! ( max headroom & taggart from eureka!) and the flamingos!!! I want one!!! Lol it's well written and lots of fun!!",1489622400,,307,4.5
4048617,5,B0031DDG9A,"Simply love the twist on an age old story. A wonderful cast with the brilliant and adorable Andrew Lee Potts as Hatter. Many other great actors with Kathy Bates as the Queen of Hearts and Matt Frewer as the White Knight  (If his name isn't familiar look him up, you've probably seen him in something!). I definitely recommend. :)",1485648000,,329,4.576271186440678
4048618,3,B0031DDG9A,"For me, it wasn't much more than an uninspired urban fantasy with Wonderland trappings. And it dragged. It's nice that Alice had a black belt and could kick ass, but she only seemed to remember that when convenient.

After I saw it, I found out that it was originally a TV mini-series. By that standard, it was okay. And nicely surreal, if you like that sort of thing. It reminded me a little of Patrick McGoohan's ""The Prisoner"". The ""suits"" the cards wore would fit in just fine in The Village.",1485475200,,496,4.450549450549451

4048630,5,B0031DDG9A,underrated. So great in every way.,1480809600,,34,4.833333333333333
4048631,5,B0031DDG9A,"I'm a huge fan of Alice in Wonderland and I have been since I was a child, so my review may be a bit biased. That said, this movie is a really interesting take on the idea of Alice in Wonderland. It is nothing like the original story - but, in some ways, I feel that makes it more like the original. This film sort of explores the idea that many literary critics have proposed in regards to Alice in Wonderland: What if it's really a story containing a lot of drug use?

This film doesn't go into that idea entirely, but this Alice falls into a Wonderland that is primarily fueled by ""drugs"" created from human emotions. It takes a new approach to the Mad Hatter, as well as the March Hare. And, frankly, I just really enjoyed it. It's not perfect, by any means, but it's pretty entertaining.",1479859200,,792,4.28
4048632,5,B0031DDG9A,Thank You for Alice a great fantasy found at Amazon.com.,1478736000,,56,4.7
4048633,4,B0031DDG9A,An alternate version and updated with a creepy feel of Alice after she follows the White Rabbit. Syfy did an extrodinary job keeping my interest in this story and it makes me long for when Fairy tales were written by the Grimm brothers instead of Disney,1478304000,,253,4.521739130434782
4048634,5,B0031DDG9A,"I love this movie/mini-series. Enjoyed it when it first came out and still like going back and rewatching it on occasion. I enjoy the storyline they developed with the ""teas"" and overall like the look they chose for the story. I think they had an excellent cast, from Catarina Scorsone as Alice to Matt Frewer as the White Knight. Kathy Bates was, of course, excellent as the Red Queen though I preferred Colm Meaney's amusing confusion and surprisingly manipulative bluster. While Philip Winchester was charming and sophisticated, my favorite character was Hatter, though that's likely due to me having been a fan of Andrew Lee Potts since seeing him in Primeval.

There are, of course, some aspects that were a bit silly (e.g., the idea that Alice was a black belt when it was obvious by the way she handled fights that she really didn't know what she was doing) and a few goofs (e.g. when Alice first breaks out of the scarab box, she magically has something to hang onto before plummeting into the water even though there is nothing inside the box for her to grab).

Overall it's a terrific movie--fun and entertaining with an interesting twist on a childhood classic and some very solid writing and acting to boot.",1477785600,,1219,4.745283018867925

4048654,5,B0031DDG9A,"Great SYFY Alice and Wonderland retelling. It is a bit cheesy but that's part of the fun! Very creative world and awesome characters. The knight is definitely my favorite character, reminding me very much of Monty Python type humor.

I bought a used copy and it was in pretty good condition and has no issues playing.

Give it a try this a great movie!",1467676800,,352,4.484375
4048655,1,B0031DDG9A,"Nick Willing apparently does not have an original idea in his head.  I've through suffered through his ""Altar"" (so run of the mill ghost story), agonized my way through ""Tin Man"" (which is stupid, pretentious, and outstandingly boring), and tonight, being a glutton for punishment, put on Alice.  This movie had one and only one redeeming feature; the Hatter is cuter, wittier, and sexier than Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's version.  Meanwhile, the entire movie rips off (to name a few):  The Matrix, Monkeybones, Lord of the Rings, Tim Burton's Alice (shamelessly), The Wizard of Oz (as though Tin Man weren't bad enough), Star Wars (complete with storm troopers), miscellaneous James Bond movies (Dr. No comes to mind), and most of the Harry Potters movies (there were eight, I'm sure you can recalll.)  Liked Kathy Bates as the Queen of Hearts -- at least she doesn't come off as a pale imitation of her role in ""Misery.""  To give Willing credit, since he can't write or direct anything original, at least he steals from good sources.  Sadly, the result is movies made to put insomniacs to sleep..",1467676800,,1098,4.839572192513369

4048661,4,B0031DDG9A,"A great movie, but might not be for those who aren't familiar with miniseries or films from the Syfy channel.

I really like this series when it aired several years ago... It is definitely a syfy movie, so if you're looking for a Hollywood budget like film, look elsewhere. If you are interested syfy movies, but not the cheesy ones, this is probably a one of the better films to watch. (Here's looking at you sharknado. - _ -;)  The plot takes elements from Lewis Carroll's original story but that's about it.

4048679,5,B0031DDG9A,"THIS WAS SO GOOD! My sister and I love Alice in Wonderland, American McGee's Alice, all of it, as much as we can get! The draw back... NOBODY DOES GOOD ALICE! It's so disappointing - Alice in Wonderland is such an iconic character, people want to hear her adventures, but they are often told so poorly or (almost impossibly) BORING.

This miniseries was so good! It's like Alice in Wonderland, meets Silent Hill, with a steampunk twist. Speaking of twists, this adaptation is such a clever retelling and I like Alice at least 90% of the time. The mad hatter is fantastic! Everyone is fantastic! The White Knight will make you laugh and break your heart in almost the same breath.

This is a darker retelling and maybe not for young kids. I really, really liked it. It felt like it was half the length it actually was, the pace was so steady and the story so gripping.",1457481600,,867,4.481012658227848

4048710,5,B0031DDG9A,"There are some excellent, well written reviews here on Amazon about the movie so I don't feel the need to ramble on about how great this miniseries is and why I love it so much. Suffice to say that I watched it numerous times on Netflix before it was taken off the site, which happens with a lot of shows. Normally I never buy a DVD unless there are a lot of good 'extra features' since much of the time I can find what I want to watch via streaming on youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Videos, etc. But when Netflix yanked it and the streaming showing on youtube wasn't very good, I decided what the heck. It wasn't very expensive, so I convinced myself that it didn't matter that there weren't any special features. I didn't read the 'Amazon' review, just saw that in the special features area that it was listed as 'none.' Imagine my delight when I received the DVD and found a commentary with the director Nick Willing and Caterina Scorsone! Would have been even better if there were additional cast members included but since I wasn't expecting anything at all, it was a very pleasant surprise. :D",1439510400,,1099,4.472636815920398

4048718,4,B0031DDG9A,"The Syfy series Alice is not faultless. There are plot holes. The CGI could be better. A lot of the plot consists of running from one place to another. Some of the scenes/lines are downright cheesy (how about that, ""Noooo!"" from Dodo?). But there's something about it that I love, and not in a ""so bad it's good"" way. I genuinely love this miniseries.

I'm not always a fan of ""modernizing"" classic stories/idea, so I was curious, but not hugely hopeful, about liking this one when it first aired. Two television viewings later, I ended up pre-ordering the DVD before it was released, and I still watch it at least a couple times a year. There are several other good reviews that go over details such as plot, so I'll not do that. For those trying to figure out if they'd like the series, here is why I do:
1. The characters. The main ones all have internal motivations of some sort, along with strengths and flaws. With only a couple exceptions, they don't generally exist merely to exist. Even ones who are fairly flat are entertaining and typically have a purpose.

2. The casting. Again, while there may be an exception or two, this series is generally well-cast. A lot of people seem to have issues with Scorsone's acting, but I haven't. It seems some people found her flat - I simply felt it part of her character, especially at the beginning; Alice is thrown into a bizarre place she doesn't understand, and she just wants herself and herself and her boyfriend out of it, with minimal involvement in anything else. I actually liked her in the scenes where she was upset, too. Potts plays Hatter to a tee and makes the character his own despite their efforts to make him so Depp-like (this came out the same year as the Burton film). Charlie the White Knight is lovably ridiculous and somehow played with a straight face by Matt Frewer. Bates' Queen of Hearts is conniving and fickle: at once a tyrant with years of ruling experience and a selfish child who's wants come before anything else. Minor characters like the Suits, the King, the Dums, etc. are all fun in their own way, too.

3. The little things, in character development and show production. The world itself is mostly built on infinitely tall buildings and other peculiar, dream-like settings. This Alice is supposedly a blackbelt, and Scorsone actually has some arm/shoulder muscle to her instead of being a toothpick. Characters that get wet are stuck that way for a few hours until they dry off. Hatter protectively huddles over his precious hat in a fight scene. Senile Charlie's use of his ""psychic powers"" suddenly gets a bit distracted as pretty women walk by. That look on the Club's face as the Queen crushes a pair of glasses he brought.  There are little parts of the actors' actions, the setting, and the script that really make this thing feel believable and fun.

4. The general feel of it. Despite any of its faults and probably limited budget, this series feels like someone's heart went into it. It feels most everyone enjoyed making it and believed in it as a work. It wasn't just pumped out to be a knock-off of the Tim Burton movie; it's unique and creative.

If you're uncertain about this series, give it a shot. Even if you don't love it as much as I do, you should at least have fun.",1435017600,8,3277,4.583617747440273

4048759,5,B0031DDG9A,"While this miniseries has a few silly parts that are lacking in the special effects department (*ahem* flamingos...), I found the overall story to be a fresh take on Alice in Wonderland and rather enjoyable. The actors do a great job (particularly Potts as Hatter and Frewer as Charlie) and with big names like Bates and Curry, how can you go wrong?

The only person that was lacking in my opinion was, sadly, Scorsone as Alice. I found her acting to be as believable as a middle school play but you grow accustomed to it as the movie goes on. Her character also has an unfortunate Mary Jane Syndrome going on: not only does she have her black belt, but she has a handsome man who wants her more than she wants him. This of course falls with the writing department, not on Scorsone's shoulders. Playing an iconic role such as Alice would be a big job for anyone, and after a few re-watches I've grown to appreciate her a bit more.

While it may not be a series for everyone, it's a must-see for die hard Alice fans and a respectable choice for Syfy fans.  If you do watch the movie, pay close attention to the way Alice runs. Are you kidding me?! Who flails their arms like that when they run?!",1416096000,,1194,4.345291479820628

The changes to the story were an interesting twist to the books.  I love they didn't try to change the story, just add to the mythology (or legend).

I don't always love the new renditions that SyFy does to movies and stories, but I loved this one. It is one of those movies that you can't stop watching once you start. I thought they did a good job with plot and keeping the original characters, but giving them different purposes. And I loved the end where she finally gets with the guy you want her to be with (I don't want to spoil it for anyone who reads this) and says ""It's you.""

4048833,4,B0031DDG9A,"I had just finished ""Tin Man"" on DVD, and it was simply amazing.  And then, SyFy (which at this point was recently renmaned from its previous Sci-Fi...which is something to this day that I do not understand) announced ""Alice"" another revamping of a fairy tale for a new generation.  I caught it when it originally aired and I was blown away.  A couple months later, I bought the DVD, and it was still spectacular!

There is one thing you should do first before watching.  The advertisements promoted it as ""from the network that brought you Tin Man.""  Get that out of your head right now!  Because you'll be comparing it to Tin Man, and it pales in comparison, not by much but it does pale.

The story is superb.  However, at times I felt it was a little too fast-paced.  Particularly the sub-plot involving Alice's father.  She's looking for her father who abandoned her as a child.  And boom he's in Wonderland.  However, these issues in pacing have very little effect on the story.  And you're too enthralled and entranced to notice them until its over.

The cast is amazing.  Caterina Scorsone was both brilliant and beautiful as Alice and Andrew Lee Potts was great as her male counterpart Hatter.  Matt Frewer was wonderfully zany as the White Knight.  Tim Curry, although TERRIBLY underused in this film, was also good.  The highlight though, the best performance in this work, was Kathy Bates as the Queen of Hearts.  Her performance is also great because she plays it differently from EVERY OTHER QUEEN OF HEARTS WE'VE EVER SEEN!  Every time we see the Queen of Hearts, it's the same portrayal- a brash and boastful loud mouth who loves to yell and execute those who disagree with her.  Bates' portrayal is quiet, calm, calculating and it makes her absolutely terrifying!

I love this movie.  I suggest it for anyone who loves science fiction, fantasy, or even a combination of the two.",1376870400,,1895,4.7073170731707314
4048834,5,B0031DDG9A,my grand-daughter and I loved watching it together....we both thought it was a good spin on Alice in Wonderland. first saw on tv but missed second part . was glad we found it thru Amazon,1376438400,,186,4.3428571428571425
4048835,5,B0031DDG9A,"I am obsessed when it comes to all things Alice in Wonderland, so, when I head about this, I jumped for it. It did not disappoint. The new take on Wonderland was interesting and intriguing, and I loved the characters. Let me start with Alice. She is not the original Alice of the stories, but a new person with the same name who come to Wonderland later to save her boyfriend Jack. She was neither unbelievably perfect, nor weak, but came across as a convincing, kick-ass, slightly damaged, fun, and lovable character. I don't want to spoil anything, but she has real depth of character. Next is Jack. He was likable, and a puzzle at the same time. It was interesting trying figure him out. I didn't like him as much as Hatter though. OMG, I could go on and on about him. He I sexy, sweet, funny, and cares about Alice, but she is afraid to trust him, and the dynamic between the two is fun to watch, even when they don't get along. Charlie is more than a bit clueless, but hilarious and loveable.  The Red Queen is the sort of character you just love to hate, just as she should be. All the while, we learn more about the new Wonderland. I loved watching this adventure, and I bet you will too.",1376265600,,1195,4.311111111111111

See the animated Disney version first or, better yet, read the books! Contrariwise, if you already love Wonderland and you are now an adult this Miniseries is a fun reimagining to spend time with. This will probably not be your favorite interpretation. Hey, it can't be tea time ALL the time! SPOILER ALERT (Kind of, but not really.) The Jabberwock makes an appearance.

She was so good and she definitely convinced me that she was Alice. And if your looking for some eye candy during the movie, Andrew-Lee Potts will not disappoint you as Hatter.

4048858,3,B0031DDG9A,"The SyFy Channel is not known for its immensely good acting but it does seem to have a niche in the genre and this time around Alice, a loose adaptation of a ""sequel"" to the children's story, has taken on a new and imaginative slant.

Alice (Caterina Scorsone) has a perfectly respectable life as a black belt karate instructor but in the back of her mind she is still the frightened ten year old child whose dad simply vanished one day. Her preoccupation with finding out what happened to him is put on temporary hold due to her romance with Jack Chase (Philip Winchester), a handsome businessman who seems interested in asking her to marry him. But when he hands her a box with a family heirloom ring in it and asks her to come with him suddenly to meet his parents, Alice slams on the brakes. She simply is not ready for this -- so out the door he goes, leaving the ring inconspicuously in her pocket. Intending to return it to him, Alice runs out into the street just in time to see Jack overpowered by thugs and dragged through a looking glass. When she leaps in after them, suddenly she is falling down a long, winding, colorful hole until she comes to a gentle thud at the bottom. Lost in a strange and mysterious new world, she runs into Hatter (Andrew Lee Potts), a well-meaning and charming but often unscrupulous thug who is part of the resistance.

Wonderland has been taken over by the vengeful Queen of Hearts (Kathy Bates), who is harvesting the positive emotions of humans from the other side of the looking glass  in order to make inexpensive ""drugs"" for her subjects. From Innocence to Wonder, all emotions pack a powerful punch and they have been making people disappear for years. Alice merely wants to rescue Jack and go home, but Hatter and his associates have other ideas for her, and when the Queen discovers her presence, she sets her mightiest assassin on Alice's trail. A showdown is inevitable and all Alice has on her side is intuition, a bit of luck, and a crazy knight (Matt Frewer).

I must admit that portions of Alice are too strange for even my odd tastes but overall the plot is engaging, the acting is surprisingly good (especially from Scorsone), they have a decent cast, and the special effects are only occasionally bad. It was fun to see them introduce different aspects of the original into the sequel without making carbon copies. All our favorite original characters are here, just in different form. The ""Caterpillar"" is in fact a member of the underground resistance, just as Hatter turns out to be a cute guy in his thirties. The costume design is unusual but interesting and I think my favorite aspect in that regard were the queen's guards, who do remind one of playing cards just with a more practical twist. Their little Club-shaped hats are fun, as is Alice's blue dress paired with red tights. Some of it is predictable and it borrows somewhat from the widely popular 10th Kingdom miniseries, but I liked it much more than I expected to.

There is not much to be concerned about in the content. Alice wears a short dress throughout and a Duchess is often shown in revealing clothing. There is some mild sensuality between a man and a woman that never progresses beyond demure flirtations. I don't remember any language but there are a handful of mild abuses of deity. Violence is not prevalent but does include martial arts fight sequences and exchanges of gunfire, in which several people are shot and killed. Assassins hunt down Alice and her companions and shoot at them, causing their flying machines to plummet into a lake. A giant monster chases them into a pit, where it briefly impales itself on one of the spikes before pulling free and ambling away. The Queen is always ordering beheadings but we never witness any of them.

I will say that toward the end of the production, the script falls a little flat. It makes sense given the situation and their experiences but I was expecting more from the showdown between Alice and the Queen. And there is an incredibly stupid plot twist involving the white knight that should have been left on the cutting room floor... but it has some quirky humor, a guest appearance from a villainous Tim Curry, and a terrific ending. Again, I saw it coming but it didn't bring any less of a smile to my face. If you enjoy classic fairy tales with a bit of a sci-fi twist, you will enjoy coming to know the spunky and determined Alice.",1363824000,,4428,4.59165613147914

4048860,3,B0031DDG9A,"First of all  this video's story, directing, and acting aside  Amazon has a long way to go in its encoding technology. Usually, I wouldn't let this sway my review, but the mediocre viewing experience absolutely effects my appreciation of Amazon's Instant Video products. Anyway, that being said...

""Alice"" was a fun twist on a well-known tale. And as a made-for-TV project, it held up quite well, considering the demands of television's runaway-train production schedules. Still, certain moments fell flat, particularly scenes that seemed like patchwork window-dressing (e.g.: all of Tim Curry's bit; what a waste of talent). Nonetheless, I would certainly recommend this (in fact, I already have...).",1363219200,,702,5.481481481481482

4048862,4,B0031DDG9A,"I really enjoyed Alice.  First off the acting was from all parties was terrific, but with the actors involved that shouldn't be surprising.  The story was a great twist to the classic Alice tail, revved up for the 21st Century.  The visual world of Wonderland was wonderful as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and get in the mood to see it over again once in a while.",1362873600,,365,4.402985074626866

4048872,4,B0031DDG9A,this modern almost sci-fi version of alice gives an alternative view of wonderland as a dark scary parallel universe scavenging off the unaware. a little romance and comedy thrown in to the mix had me cheering for the underdog.,1360713600,,227,4.846153846153846

4048874,4,B0031DDG9A,"SyFy took a very entertaining approach with this classic Wonderland story. It's a well balanced and nicely acted story with a solid cast (Kathy Bates, Harry Dean Stanton). The familiar elements of the story are here, but altered for a modern time. We've seen a recent exploration of Alice returning to Wonderland, but this is, in my opinion, better than Tim Burton's feature film.

The settings are modernized to a cityscape that is slowly being taken back by nature. It's a good metaphor for the world with Alice as nature. The animals (white rabbit, caterpillar) are all replaced with human actors, but used to the same affect. The sets, costumes and production design are the real winners, but along with a good script and updated story, it's one that works for future stories (although that isn't SyFy's style).

Whatever you want to call it, this version of Alice in Wonderland was a lot of fun, a lot of laughs, and had me on the edge of my seat more than would be expected for a story that's already been done before.  The twists and turns are creative (not shocking or anything) to the point that you'll be able to recognize elements of the original story without feeling bored.",1355788800,,510,4.291666666666667
4048888,5,B0031DDG9A,"In my opinion one of the best depictions of Alice since the animated Disney movie release.
Growing up in a society who all recognizes Alice in Wonderland as one of the greatest classical children's fantasy stories ever has made me extremely cautious when it comes to different interpretations of this story. However, I felt compelled to watch this TV miniseries based on this exact preconceived notion. Sooner rather than later I found myself no longer comparing the original story and depictions as I thought it should be. As a result I absolutely enjoyed it for what it was--spectacular and ridiculously good. This version captures the very essence of what makes Carroll's story so irresistible: an enchantingly magical world that a young girl---in this case woman--inadvertently stumbles into and must venture on to save both Wonderland and the real world from the evil Queen of Hearts.

I fell in love with the characters immediately and the actors played their roles brilliantly. Unlike most portrayals of Alice this Alice is a fighter, strong-willed yet maintains her innocent charm. I'd recommend this version for 15+ up because although this is based on Alice in Wonderland it has some older content probably not suited for a younger audience. Nevertheless, if you enjoy the original concept you will more than find this adaption adequate. You cannot help but love this version which combines the original Alice in Wonderland story with the more modern retelling of Through the Looking Glass; it's a perfect blend of science fiction and fantasy. Syfy really did an exceptional job with this series and the most surprising thing of all is how few people have seen this version.

You'll adore Alice and the Hatter because they make an amazing team. I even loved the portrayal and addition of Jack. It's a twisted and as modern as it gets retelling. I'm not ashamed to admit I've watched this more than 5 times and introduced it to many of my friends and family members who've all felt exactly the same way about it--that it's wonderful. With a great cast of many talented actors this miniseries is worth buying and re-watching over and over again.",1355356800,,2153,4.961218836565097

4048899,4,B0031DDG9A,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 2009 production of Alice in Wonderland . . .
As a general rule in this review series of all the AIW films listed on Amazon I've been excluding productions that do not in some way enact the passages of either of the two Lewis Carrol books on Alice. Examples of excluded titles would be Alice in Wondertown (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-In-Wondertown/dp/B001KW90KS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice In Wondertown</a>), and Malice in Wonderland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malice-in-Wonderland/dp/B0036EBALK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malice in Wonderland</a>), which rather than being direct adaptations, or even interpretations, of Carroll's works, are simply takeoffs on the name, likeness, and the quality of strangeness to Alice's adventures, and bear little resemblance to the books. This particular takeoff on the Alice story however, which does not in any way pretend to enact the *passages* from the book, uses so many of the book's *elements* that it seemed worthwhile to include it in this series.

Where Lewis Carroll would turn the meaning of a word on its ear, British writer/director Nick Willing turned each story element, as well as each of Carroll's characters on their respective ears, rendering a dystopic view of a future Wonderland gone wrong. Mr. Willing rounded up a passel of age-old cinematic themes and put them to work in an engaging way. While watching the DVD I couldn't help but note a list of movies they pay tribute to; The production is part AIW of course, but it's also part Wrinkle in Time (where a kidnapped scientist/father used for evil purpose is rescued by his children), part Sleeping Beauty (in reverse - the female ""wakes up"" the male), part Lord of the Rings (the portal powering Stone of Wonderland ring), part Casa Blanca (the Hatter serving up 'drinks' to all comers, good or bad... until -driven by love- sides with the resistance to save the world), and way too many Star Trek episodes to count (where one race preys upon another to sap its resources). Oh my, it's so much fun. We never tire of such drama, as long as it is enacted in new and refreshing ways.

Which this film is. I was surprised that a few reviewers knocked the special effects. For me, the look of the film is one of its strongest suits. They used CGI to create a very convincing world... the sky scraping buildings with decayed walkways, the flying gnat-like transport, the grotesque face on the Jabberwock, the film maker's version of the Speeder Bikes from Star Wars episode VI, taking the form of flying Flamingos! And of course the terrifying chambers of horrors staged by the Tweedle brothers (I always knew they were secretly evil).

By the way, they correctly used the singular form of the name 'Jabberwock' in the dialog. And this is only the second Alice production I've seen where they used a 100% glass table in the hall of doors, as described in the book.

My second favorite thing is the film's concept. The idea of an economy based on the trafficking, not of human *flesh*, as has been done on Earth for millennia, but rather in the bottling & sale of human *emotions*, trading in contentment, joy, lust, passion, surprise, adoration, ecstasy, calm, elation, peace, hope, excitement, relief, thrills, energy, awe, serenity, empathy, gratitude, innocence, clear conscience, hullabaloo, and honesty. Yes, I made a list, because it's interesting to see all the so-called positive emotions packed in together. Being able to procure these sought after states of mind is an almost irresistible proposition, is it not? At the end of the day however, flesh or emotions, it's slavery either way.

And then of course there are the re-shuffled wonderland characters. I LOVED Mad March, the turtlenecked robot with the electronically induced ESP and a New York gangster voice. You never were quite sure what he was capable of. The white knight certainly stole the scene whenever present. The actor is the same guy who starred in the brilliant but short lived 'Max Headroom' show in the 80's. 28 year old Caterina Scorsone pulled off an updated Alice who's packing a bit more than an inquisitive disposition this time around. And everyone else was great too. Oh, regarding the Mad Hatter, I found Andrew Lee-Potts' impression quite adequate, but I had no idea what a heartthrob he is for the ladies until reading the Amazon reviews. Wow! What's the attraction girls? I could understand the attraction to Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter. But Andrew Lee-Potts? Is it the McCartney-esk puppy dog eyes? I don't know, but women love him. I want to come back as *that* guy. For me, a guy, I spent most of the time trying to figure out if the Hatter was a good guy or a bad guy. By the way, speaking of the reviews, this movie is the 4th most reviewed Alice production on Amazon.

All in all a great effort by the Sci-Fi channel. That channel's hits are few and far between in my book, with the remake of Battlestar Galactica (first two seasons only) a marked exception. But this production rocked. As to what Lewis Carroll would think... he's either loving these interpretations of his books or spinning in his grave. I know not which.

4048903,5,B0031DDG9A,I loved this miniseries when it first aired and am so glad that they released it on Bluray. I love Andrew Lee Potts as Hatter. I could watch him in anything. This is definitely one of the best miniseries that SyFy has come up with.,1347926400,,231,4.155555555555556
4048904,4,B0031DDG9A,This is the only version of Alice In Wonderland I will watch. It's a great twist to the original story. I love this movie.,1347148800,,122,4.125
4048905,5,B0031DDG9A,"I came across this mini-series on Netflix and decided to give it a shot...I was laughing and/or smiling the whole time! Firstly, don't go looking for the classic tale with this, all the elements are there, but the concept is that Wonderland has evolved over the last 150 years, leaving us with a still-evil Queen of Hearts that enjoys drugging her populace with human emotions to keep them biddable and obedient.

In this version, Alice is a 20 something karate instructor who has a hard time trusting men ever since her father supposedly ""walked-out"" on her and her mom. Her trust issues have caused her some problems when it comes to dating, although in the beginning of this series she is hopeful that she might have finally found Mr. Right in her boyfriend Jack. Dinner with Jack and her Mother ensues, followed by a rather unexpected proposal from Jack, which Alice turns down. We see Jack leave and get chased down by some shadowy characters. Alice finds that Jack had slipped the ring into her dress, so she runs out after him, only to see him be unceremoniously stuffed into a van that speeds away. She is approached by the ""white rabbit"" who tries to intimidate her into hadning over the ring, leading into a chase where Alice falls through a looking glass.

It's an adventure from there with ALice looking for Jack, only to learn that he was not exactly what he seemed. She learns the truth about her father, and (you probably guessed it) brings down the Queen and learns a little something about trust.

Catriona Scorsone plays a smart, kick-ass but vulnerable Alice very well, Kathy Bates seems to be having great fun as the red queen, and another reviewer said it best ""Andrew Lee Potts is a delisciously wacky, sexily disheveled hatter"".

All in all, this is a fabulously fun watch. It's bizarre, and cooky, but isn't that what Wonderland is supposed to be???? There is also a bit of romance mixed in, and for us hopeless romantics, the ending doesn't disappoint. =)

All I can say is I watched it once on Netflix and promptly ordered here at Amazon as I can tell it's one of those movies I will watch over and over for years to come.",1346457600,,2148,4.597911227154047

4048908,4,B0031DDG9A,"This is by far my favorite of the Syfy fairy tale revisions. I enjoy these ""fractured fairy tales"" and the different spins they put on the traditional versions.

But just as things are starting to go well for them; Jack is kidnapped in front of her, which leads Alice on an adventure to Wonderland in order to free him. There she picks up companions like the Hatter and the White Knight in order to search out and rescue Jack.

The story here is easy to watch and definitely entertaining enough to appreciate in one setting (unlike say Tin Man which I can't usually endure all at once - seriously, Zooey Deschanel bleh!). They could have got way more mileage out of a wonderful actress like Kathy Bates as the Queen of Hearts, but that is a small nit pick in general.

I love what they did with the tea, really makes you think. And although I've never heard of anyone in this movie except Kathy Bates, the acting is phenomenal.

4048922,5,B0031DDG9A,"The reason this modern day rendition of Alice works so well is that it does not try to re-tell Lewis Carroll's fantasy, but instead uses many of the same characters and character traits to build a completely different version of Wonderland where the 'wonders' are emotions and the Queen's Castle is a casino. In short, the Queen is a drug dealer - and uses the addictive nature of these 'wonders' (extracted from humans) to keep the Wonderland economy running. When Alice finds herself in the middle of a growing revolution, she haltingly accepts the aid of the Hatter as she attempts to find her kidnapped boyfriend and long-ago missing father.

The writing of this TV Miniseries is tightly done, which is impressive given the amount of characters they manage to believably work into the plot. The cast is excellent, which makes the adventure all the more fun to take, however, I would like to point out that the Amazon review touches on all of the outstanding casting, save for one; Andrew Lee Potts (of 'Primeval' fame), who is cast as Hatter. Though this character isn't touched upon in the standard Amazon review, I wanted to stress in the importance of this character in my review, for all of the Mad Hatter enthusiasts out there. I believe that this character is magnificently portrayed, and I feel it was important to mention, as much of the plot would not be as fun to follow if we, the audience, were not taken in by Hatter from the beginning.

Overall, this story is fun, unique and a pleasure to watch. Are there some cheesy and silly moments in the fray? Yes. :) But there is also action, adventure, romance, and humor all throughout this retelling, resulting in an enjoyable watch every time.

This somehow succeeds, whether or not you love the original Alice. It's different enough to be its own creature entirely. When it re-uses familair characters and settings, Alice homage is there without any attempt to retroactively redefine the originals. But, if you simply take it for itself, without reference to the classic, it offers an urban SF/fantasy blend with visible (if slightly heavy-handed) concern for contemporary issues. I'm sure judo students everywhere will be disappointed in the first scenes, but I'll tolerate that to set up the strong and independent leading lady.

Without imitating, defacing, or counterfeiting the original, this offers Alice fans an interesting and very updated view of how the story might play today.

It is WAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY too long to view as a feature film.  The plot meanders all over the place.  The production values are embarrassing.  (Psst, Syfy, your cardboard scenery is showing.)

This is Wonderland, many years on from THE Alice's visit. Things've taken a dark turn, under the rule of the Queen of Hearts; it's all about instant gratification, and it comes at a cost. And I won't go any further than that, because spoilers are no fun.
I found this mini-series to be surprisingly well-written and thought out, except for occasional departures into the downright silly. I enjoyed it far more than I expected to. And it led directly to my becoming a fan of Primeval, as well, because I so enjoyed Andrew Lee Potts in it.
I'd been concerned that absence had made the heart grow fonder; that my memory of my not-quite-complete viewing of it when it aired was more positive than it deserved.

Some of the shots of the outdoors are amazing - beautiful scenic shots of mountain ranges, lakes, and forests in the outlying areas of Wonderland.  Then there's the gritty, practically post-apocalytic urban vibe in ""downtown Wonderland"".  I particularly found the royal casino and the uniforms of the card dealers to be aesthetically pleasing.  This version is 100% modern and the core of the story is very different than the original Through the Looking Glass/Adventures in Wonderland.  But many of the characters and basic concepts are there.  I found it extremely entertaining seeing this spin on the story.  One of my favorite ""nods"" to the original Alice were these pink flamingo vehicles that are like motorcycles but they fly through the air and the rider has to hang on to the awkward flamingo neck for dear life when traveling at warp speed.  (In the animated Disney movie, the Queen of Hearts used pink flamingos as croquet rackets.)  I like this movie better than Tin Man because I found it more visually pleasing.  To me, it's up there with the Tenth Kingdom.  I even liked this movie better than the recent version with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter (I'm sure I'm in the minority on that though).

4048948,4,B0031DDG9A,"I love Alice, it's a stand-out among the many works that have been inspired by Lewis Carrol over the years. It comes off as more of an affectionate tribute to the original story than a rehashing of the same or attempt to ""modernize"" a classic. In the universe of the series, we are told that the events of the original story did happen 150 years ago, but have little impact on the rest of the series. I thought this was a far better and more respectful way of doing things than Tim Burton's film, which seemed like an egotistical attempt to make a true sequel to the original.

I loved the aesthetic of the series, especially in the city. I only wish they had spent more time on the plot, or given the writers an extra episode or 2 to flesh things out. In a lot of scenes, something interesting would be brought up and I'd get curious but then they'd never be explained. Like, what was up with Hatter's hand that made people scared of it? Also, you put Tim Curry's name in all the ads and then he's literally in only one scene? There's all this talk about how bad things are in Wonderland, but very little is actually shown. Why did Charlie's trick with the skeleton army work?

Overall, though, it's great. However, it's a small made-for-tv event from a minor cable channel. That gave me very low expectations of quality. However, Nick Willing took the resources he had and got the very most out of them. This is an entertaining watch with likable characters, action, and eye-catching visuals.

The characters were brilliant and strongly played although Jack wasn't used to the best of his abilities. The ideas were sharp and fun with many play on words, which always make me happy.

Simply put, this story really gave me the ""What next"" that I have been craving. I never saw it on TV but after seeing the new Alice in Wonderland with Depp, et al, and being mildly amused by it (It was a good dark story and really gave you a grasp of what could be), my daughter said that I NEEDED to see this version. So I ordered the disk. (I figured if I didn't like it, I'd give it to her, because she LOVES this version.)

I was intrigued, from the start. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a retelling of the original Alice story but a continuation (much like the Depp version).  The story has enough dark to it to be believable and enough humor in it to keep your attention...(Hatter's line in the beginning about girls in wet dresses showed me that I needed to keep on my toes and listen.) With a cast that includes Bates and Curry, I knew I had to give it a shot. And, sigh...I wasn't disappointed even if I thought that Tim Curry should have had more screen time. Yes, Andrew Lee Potts is adorable, stealing your heart from minute one, and just gifted in this role - I looked forward to every scene he was in and Matt Frewer as the White Knight, Charlie, was freaking amazing and he just nailed it. Both of them were sane enough to be beloved and insane enough to be believable.

And Alice, Caterina Scorsone, just rocks. I can't stand a ""woe is me"" heroine, and Scorsone, goes in and kicks butt. She has her moments where she is just there but her character is learning and growing and really gets tested...but when the moment comes, she lets loose and just plain rocks. She's smart and strong, but soft and caring, very well-rounded character for the type of story this was.

While there are a few things that were superfluous....like the Drink Me Bottle (with its warning label - lol) and the Cheshire cat scene...I don't think it detracted from the story nor did I really miss them.  This is an entirely different tale with same but different characters. However, all the more enjoyable. Just as Tin Man was to the Wizard of Oz, this is to Wonderland. I do believe Mr. Carroll would be impressed.

So, no, my daughter can get her own copy, this one's mine. Goes on my movie shelf with the others that are my ""need a good story"" tales. I love a good HEA and it's about bloody time Hatter got his.",1293667200,3,2550,4.3

I was right. It's a super serie, I really loved it. The actors are great, I'm so happy I bought it!

There are just so many great aspects about this movie, i love that the queen runs a casino where they harvest pure human emotion so that she (and others with money) can indulge on whatever feeling they like, whenever. The way they did the mad hatter character is genius, and kinda sexy oddly.  There is no point during this movie that is boring, and you really don't know what to expect next.  Plus, there is a sexy character for anyone to enjoy.  It is very action-packed!!!! I have never recommended a movie to anyone in my life until i watched this, I also NEVER create reviews for things, but this is a MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!! it will change your idea of what an amazing movie is.

4048971,5,B0031DDG9A,"This has to be my favorite adaptation of a children's classic ever. And it mostly has to do with Andew Lee Potts. I first saw him in Primeval & absolutely fell in love! I was soo angry with the BBC for taking it off the air so abruptly. Then I saw the previews for Alice. I watched the whole mini series. The look was amazing & the story was just twisted enough. Kathy Bates, Matt Frewer, Colm Meaney, Harry Dean Stanton & Tim Curry were all very well cast. I did wish that Caterina Scorsone's Alice was a little bit more proactive but all in all I liked her mix of toughness & vulnerability. However Andrew Lee Potts was terrific as the Hatter. I bought the DVD the minute I saw it on sale. Jonny Depp was incredible in Alice in Wonderland but Andrew Lee Potts will alway be the best Hatter ever!",1289174400,,797,4.215686274509804
4048972,5,B0031DDG9A,"If you're expecting an updated version of the old Alice in Wonderland, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for something completely new, this is the Alice for you. This story takes place 150 years after little blonde Alice fell down the rabbit hole, in a much, much different Wonderland. Caterina Scorsone is excellent as Alice, a troubled young woman who is unable to form lasting relationships ever since her father disappeared when she was 10. Andrew-Lee Potts, well known in England but relatively new to U.S. audiences, is charming as Hatter, a streetwise ""tea"" purveyor who might or might not be Alice's best friend in Wonderland. Kathy Bates inspires dread as the power-hungry Queen of Hearts, while Colm Meaney lends the perfect attitude as her ever-faithful husband. Tim Curry intimidates as Dodo, and Harry Dean Stanton is notably mysterious as Caterpillar. However, Matt Frewer (Max Headroom) nearly steals the whole show as The White Knight. His interpretation of an aging but chivalrous and loyal protector of ""Alice of Legend"" is clever, funny, poignant, and positively brilliant. All in all, Alice is 184 minutes of pure entertainment, and I highly recommend it.",1286928000,,1183,5.198952879581152

The cast is excellent, and I was surprised to find myself truly caring for Alice and the other characters in the midst of this psychedelic carnival ride.  There is a connection with Lewis Carroll's story, but only as a springboard into an original science-fiction story.

This is not just a rehash of fantasy cliches.  It's original at every level, from art design to the story.  There are a few underused characters and storylines, and a clunky scene or two; the CGI is what you'd expect from a TV show, but the special effects are in the service of a good story.  It might be too intense and weird for pre-teens.

Very few shows in any genre have made fans out of everybody in my family, male and female, teenagers and parents.  This one got six thumbs up.",1280448000,2,815,4.386666666666667

My advice would be don't compare it to the cartoon from eons ago, as with any re-make, IMO would be take it on its own merits.

4048988,4,B0031DDG9A,"When I originally saw this on Syfy it was as a mini series in two parts.  To be honest, the first part was hard to sit through.  Caterina Scorsone as Alice was very unconvincing, she is supposed to be a black belt but on many occasions you begin to wonder how that is possible as she bumbles her way through everything.  It seems more luck and her friends keeping her alive.  Her boyfriend Jack was the kind of guy that made you wonder why she even liked him in the first place.  He reminded me of a snake through out the whole movie.  It got better when Hatter, played by Andrew-Lee Potts entered the story.  During the first half he doesn't have alot of screen time and perhaps that's why the first part is so hard to sit through.  When he has more dominate screen time in the second part, that is when it starts to get good.  His character is constantly evolving.  He starts as a sleazy salesman, to doing things only for the benefit of himself, to genuinely wanting to do things to help Alice and the people of Wonderland.  Yet throughout Alice doesn't listen to anything he says and doesn't trust him even though he saves her countless times.  Alot of the characters are lacking in depth.  I would have to say that the only other characters in the story who are worth watching would be the Knight, played by Matt Frewer and the King of Hearts, played by Colm Meaney.  So if you watch, don't be suprised if most of the characters are unrelatable.  However it does have a pretty good story line and if you watch it for Hatter, the Knight and the King of Hearts it is a very good movie.  Just ignore every other character. :)",1279065600,,1627,4.32013201320132

4048991,2,B0031DDG9A,"What can really be said about this miniseries brought to us by SyFy? First off, the series is mildly entertaining at best, when there aren't story inconsistencies glaring at you through the screen.

From the beginning of things:
Alice is middle aged and a 'Judo Instructor' which may have been something they wanted to look for in a stunt person, as the action scenes revolving around Alice were laughable when not childhood destroying.

After a demonstration of the best judo you will see in the movie, from the class, we find out that Alice is seeing one of her students, and he has been there for at least 3 weeks. How does an entire society lose an important person for ""3 weeks"" (in fact longer, when taking into account the time disparity) without sending out a search party?

Alice has been looking for her dad for quite some time and has been, incoming story undertone, having issues with men. I had signed up for watching a different viewpoint on the classic story of Alice in Wonderland, not every romantic comedy ever made.

Alice's boyfriend gives her a ring, which apparently is vital to the Looking Glass operating. Again I am forced to wonder what is wrong with the hierarchy in Wonderland that they didn't notice that their only connection to our world had been gone for YEARS! This done by the comment of ""You were out there for an hour before the construction worker found you."" when the story takes place over a 2 day period. This roughly translates to the 'Stone of Wonderland' being gone for 1000 days, or 2 years, 9 months.

From the look of the scenery and layout/size of the apartment that Alice and her mother share, it is easy to see that they live in a larger city. This brings up an interesting point about the Looking Glass... How is it that a massive mirror in an alleyway hasn't been stolen, broken or otherwise ""modified""?

Enter Wonderland. I will admit that the look of Wonderland was quite interesting and lent itself to some of the more interesting aspects of the show. The look of a dilapidated modern society gave enough of a realistic feel that it kept things interesting. That said, there could have been significantly more color than a generic gray with plants growing over it. This does absolutely nothing good for scenery. The 'Tea House' was a very nice touch and one of the high points of this show. Emotions as a commodity was a very nice touch and opened the door for a unique type of 'Mad Hatter' to be shown. After being introduced to the Hatter, this door was slammed shut as he is portrayed as more of a manipulative fast-talker than mad in any sense of the word.

Including another character from the book was nice, the Dodo, however they almost completely lost the Cheshire Cat.

Quick summary of things, character development progresses for about an hour and a half, maybe two hours then is forgotten entirely as the characters become about as interesting to watch as paint drying. There is the inclusion of the 'White Knight' from 'Through the Looking Glass' which should have been left out, or rewritten as the ""Mad"" Hatter as he was the only mad character involved in this story.

The story is disjointed and weak, the characters are uninteresting and about as generic as can be found in anything. The plot decided to walk off the set after the filming was done, and subsequently was cut from the last 1/3 of the presentation. Although many people find that this is a good story, it suffers from all the troubles that Tin Man did, in roughly the same sequence and timing.

I want the 3 hours of my life back.",1276560000,4,3565,4.6
4048992,5,B0031DDG9A,"Wonderful miniseries, loved every moment of it. It was nice that they took something classic, did totally their own thing with it, and remained respectful - if not very faithful to the original story.

4048993,5,B0031DDG9A,"During the 1990s, the Hallmark Channel established a reputation as being great at taking known stories and turning them into solid, entertaining movies.  In the past decade, the Syfy channel has taken over this role.  With classics such as Tin Man and Battlestar Galactica, they have a long list of hits to their credit.  Maybe their best creation of 2009 was this rendition of Alice in Wonderland.  Titled simply ""Alice"" this movie is a combination of fantasy, adventure, drama, suspense, comedy and science fiction.  The movie stars a cast of smaller name stars such as Tim Curry and Kathy Bates, and is anchored by relatively unknown actors and actresses.  The story is only loosely based on the original Alice book, which is good seeing the large number of Alice movies made over the past 30 years.  All the main characters from the Lewis Carroll book are in this movie, though in roles, shapes and forms that blow the imagination.  The special effects are decent, the dialogue is great, and the soundtrack is snazzy and catchy.  All told, a great movie.",1276387200,,1058,4.833333333333333
4048994,5,B0031DDG9A,"I loved watching this show. If you're one of those people who believes that children's books grow with those who've loved them, then chances are you'll love this adult perspective on ""What happens after Alice leaves Wonderland""?

A word of caution though: If you're one of those people who believe that the only way to enjoy Alice is to stick as close to the animated Disney version as possible or stuff it so full of CGI it makes your head spin off, then you shouldn't watch this show. There's very little CGI used and it's a much grittier version of Wonderland that parallels the gritty changes our world has made since the period when ""Alice"" was first published.

I would highly recommend this to anyone I know. It's definitely high on the list of movies I'd watch over and over.",1275696000,,783,4.585714285714285

However,  to me the great star of this piece is the design: The old cut away urban cityscape; the wonderland library and elevator; the old kingdom.

4049019,5,B0031DDG9A,"I am a huge, huge fan of Alice In Wonderland/Through The Looking Glass.  I have seen just about every single version ever made and have most on DVD.  I even have the original silent film version from 1903 on DVD.  I now have this Alice DVD and have also seen the Tim Burton film in the theater.

What I really love about this ""Alice"" film is it's so different and unique from any other Alice films.  Most others are more fantasy and more for children.  But this version, while children can enjoy it, is more mature and just aimed more for adults like myself.  My all time favorite version is the 1985 two part version that had Natalie Gregory as Alice but I really love this film about as much really.  I've seen so many different versions and love them all for different reasons but I'm really feeling like this version or take on the story is in my top 3 now of Alice films.  The 1985 version and the version with Miranda Richardson are the others that I really love more than others.

This Alice played by Caterina Scorsone is so awesome as Alice.  She's not helpless.  She's able to take care of herself, and has a much more reason to be in Wonderland because she has a real purpose.  Someone very close to her is in Wonderland and she has to try to find them.  I won't spoil the film but this is one of many reasons this film stands out more for me.

The Mad Hatter, who is played by Andrew Lee Potts in this is also very smart and awesome in this.  He has so much more personality than most of the other mad hatters from other films.  He is so attractive as well which is a plus!!

I really love the March Hare in this as well and he's really called Mad March and he is so hilarious!  One of the best lines in this film is from Mad March and it's so funny when the Queen of Hearts who's played by Kathy Bates asks him how he is.  She asks ""Mad March...how...are...you...today?""  and he replies ""Piss...off...you...cow!""  LOL!!  It's just so funny and he is a robot so that's why you see it written like that.  You just have to see it.

Speaking of The Queen Of Hearts, Kathy Bates is brilliant in this role!  They casted the perfect person to play the queen.  I love her facial expressions as well.  There's this one part when she wants Alice to come to the throne room and the King of Hearts says she's escaped.  The expression on her face is priceless!

The Dodo is played by Tim Curry.  I have to say that he is so funny when is talking about the Hatter playing two sides of the court and trying to get two trophies and he says ""you swarrrmm about"" and it's the way he says it that I find it so funny.

The whole idea for the film is all the people look like regular people but they all play a part from the original story.  You have these men who are playing the deck of cards but they are dressed up in black suits with numbers on them.  This is such a unique film because it's like a sci-fi and drama version.  There are no musical numbers in here.  It's so weird and magical and at the same time, very modernized and dramatized.  I love the chemistry between Alice and Hatter.  I won't give anything away but believe me, you'll find out why I love them together.

Another thing I have to mention is the setting.  I love how there are no streets and bottomless pits and the casino where the Queen is, is made of playing cards.  You have this amazing forest hiding a long forgotten fortress and people ride on mechanical flamingos.  It's just so awesome.  They really did an awesome job with this film.  It's a must buy for any Alice fan who doesn't mind a different take on the story and who likes sci-fi and drama.  Well, I should say it's more of a return to wonderland.  It's not a remake but more like a sequel than anything.  But if you've seen the Tim Burton film where it's more fantasy, this film is like a return to wonderland but more sci-fi and drama.  I have to say that if I have to choose between this film and the Tim Burton film, while I love the fantasy a lot, this film I love more just because it's deeper and makes you think more.  But I love both films of course.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1271203200,3,4118,4.203324808184143

4049025,4,B0031DDG9A,"Over the years there have been many versions of the Lewis Carroll's ""Alice"" stories, aimed at varying audiences. Some try to stay faithful, which does not always capture the essence cinematically, some revel in the surrealism and absurdity of the stories, which some find alienating, and others try to add more of a connecting plot to the disjointed stories. This plumps for the the latter approach.
In this story Alice is a strong minded twenty-something with commitment issues stemming from the disappearance of her father when she was a child. When her boyfriend Jack tries to give her a ring, she ends their date. Changing her mind, she goes after him, only to watch him kidnapped by a group of suit wearing agents. The white suited supervisor of this operation engages in a fight with Alice and takes the ring box. Alice chases him through a looking glass and stumbles into a dystopic, retro, steampunk Wonderland. After escaping a trap laid by the man in white, she is red to the Mad Hatter - who runs a ""tea room"". Here, Wonderlanders are supplied with pleasant human emotions in tea form - an opiate that pacifies them and prevents their revolution against the Queen of Hearts - the despotic ruler who dictates from a spiralling, palatial casino. In the game rooms, captives from the real world, called ""Oysters"", are kept hypnotised and stimulated while their pleasant emotions are drained and distilled by Mr. Walrus and Mr. Carpenter (Characters from a poem recited in ""Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There"".
To continue this operation, the King and Queen require a gem that activates the looking glass portal - a gem that what stolen by there son Jack and given to his girlfriend in the real world - Alice! When the Queen discovers that Agent White has brought her an empty box, she sends him to be beheaded and sends the criminally insane Mad March to find the girl.
Hatter, secretly a resistance member, helps Alice hide from the Queen's forces and also to dodge some zealous resistance fighters lead by a man codenamed Dodo who are eager to get the gem off her finger. The two escape by fleeing into a forest inhabit by The Jabberwocky (a dragon from a poem read by Alice in ""Through the Looking Glass"")
and meet the eccentric, quixotic White Knight, an elderly inventor and warrior who harkens for the ways of the old Kingdom of the Red King before The Queen of Hearts came to power.
Together, the three of join forces with the resistance leader, codenamed Caterpillar, infiltrate the casino and are assisted by Jack and his betrothed, The Duchess, to overcome the Queen's forces, including interrogators Doctors Dum and Dee. Alice finds out, along the way, what happened to her father and Jack is installed as the new Red King after the Queen's regime is brought down.
This film follows in the footsteps of ""Tin Man"", SyFy's previous retelling of a classic story, ""Wizard of Oz"". Like that film, it follows a young woman who goes to another world and finds that someone with her name has been their many years ago. Both films have a similarly steampunk/contemporary/dystopic aesthetic. This film improves a little on that very good miniseries by handling the pacing a little better.
The story retains some of the surreal qualities of the original books and the environs of Wonderland work in similarly nonsensical ways. Some of this is explained by the particular science and technology of the realm. Many of the familiar characters are here, in modernised or abstracted ways. They are each given more relationships and functions in Wonderland by the addition of the political plot. Some may say that this is is against the surreal essence of the books, but that is a matter of taste. This certainly has some grweat wit and irony, something that fits with the original.
The history spoken of is a little confusing. Alice recognises Wonderland as a place from the children's books but does not seem to make many connections. Hatter and several others speak of the Alice of Legend who came there many years ago. Hatter says that she brought down the whole house of cards and The Queen refers to herself as the most powerful woman in the history of literature. Meanwhile, the White Knight remenisces about the days of The Red King and how he ruled wonderland, and this man who is so loyal to him is the White Knight. It is somewhat unclear who ruled when and whether the characters are the same, or others who have taken their titles, or a bit of both. In spite of this, the story is compelling an eminently enjoyable - the action is well told.
Each of the actors play their parts well and the Queen of Hearts is a role that kathy Bates must surely have been waiting a long time to get her turn at.
The design is amazing - the steampunk beatle shaped flying machine, the carnivalesque/retro looking flamingo airbikes, the gaudy, sixties vegas looking hearts casino and the costumes that suggest the characters from the original but fit the modern feel of the world - all wonderful!
This is a particularly innovative sci-fi/fantasy production - happily bringing  a fascinating new interpretation to a well loved classic. See this along with Tim Burton's new filf ""Alice in Wonderland"" to compare two great retellings.",1270598400,5,5246,4.777533039647577

 This version is mostly for adults and not for kids, which is fine because every version including the Tim Burton movie is aimed at a kid audience. This was mostly played as cool and hip with more to offer adults than kids.
 I didn't really get the whole moral thing. Something about instant gratification or something. The message seemed to get lost in all of the nonsense. But then that's kind of ironic isn't it?
  All in all the Tim Burton movie was probably better but this was a lot of fun too. Definitely worth watching if you are an 'Alice' fan. Beware the scary rabbit. Also the Tweedles. The Tweedles were evil.

4049029,5,B0031DDG9A,"I like to think of myself as an ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass"" adaptation connoisseur. I'm not sure why, since I haven't been a die hard fan until recently.

That being said, I also have a pretty low opinion of SyFy original movies. Mega Shark, anyone?

Last weekend, a friend turned me on to this movie/miniseries, and I have to say... this might be the best Alice adaptation EVER. I saw the Tim Burton version last weekend too, and while I *adored* Johnny Depp's Hatter and Stephen Fry's Cheshire Cat, you just can't beat Andrew Lee Potts, and I didn't want to rewatch the ending to Burton's about ten times (ok, so I only watched it four times... same dif ~_^).

Basically, ""Alice"" is a fairy tale for adults. It's a version of the story in which Wonderland is real, and the heroine is familiar with the story books about it. If you're looking for the old story, you're going to be very confused when you run into bottled emotions, Alice's mysterious father, a not-so-mad Hatter, and a March Hare Assassin.

If you're looking for a mildly actiony, suspensefully romantic story about a lost (but basically self-sufficient) girl who meets the man of her dreams and fights an army of casino-running human traffickers, this is the movie for you!

Forget all those other SyFy movies and think of Tin Man! That was awesome, right? This is awesome too!!

Skip the Disney cartoon and the '99 TV miniseries... Watch Burton's reimagining, but take this one home on DVD. You definitely won't regret it.",1270252800,,1524,4.753787878787879

4049032,5,B0031DDG9A,"This mini-series, part of SyFy Channel's reinvention, is a wonderful re-imagination of Alice in Wonderland. Every character from the story has a new role to make this distopia a great homage to Lewis Carroll genius.",1269475200,,215,5.171428571428572
4049033,5,B0031DDG9A,"I love Lewis Carroll's original stories but I'm not a purist. Adaptations of archetypal characters, if they are done well, make me very happy.
This one was wonderful.
Alice is a strong, capable young woman but she's not perfect. She's been dating a man named Jack and serious enough about it to introduce him to her mother. She has issues trusting men though so when he offers a ring, she gets rejects it.
After he leaves, she finds the ring in her pocket and goes chasing after him to give it back. She finds him being hustled into a van and meets a sinister man all in white.
I loved how the classic elements were reworked in this adaptation. Turned inside out and upside and completely re-interpreted. The Queen of Hearts keeping the populace happy with drugs made of the emotions of the ""Oysters"", the contrast of the shining Prince Charming compared to the roguish Hatter. The romance was well balanced and sweet, Wonderland was bright and colorful from the outside and gritty and a bit scary on the inside. It's not Alice Liddell's world anymore and this Alice is not a dreamer who has problems being practical. She's very practical and needs to learn how to dream and have faith.
The jarring parts were actually the spots that kept the most true to the original story, because it was all re-imagined so well, those elements seemed out of place.
But like my title says, what really pushed this from 4 stars to 5 for me was Matt Frewer. His comedic timing and his ability to say the most nonsensical things and be absolutely sincere about it served the White Knight character very well. You expect Kathy Bates and Tim Curry to dominate any scene they are in, and they did. Tim Curry's role unfortunately was very small. Matt Frewer is easier to forget until you see him in a role that plays up that ridiculous sincerity very well. Then you remember how wonderful he really is at those sorts of roles.
I think I actually liked this better than Tin Man. It wasn't as dark and the ending just made me go ""AWWW!"" It was dark enough however to retain the creepiness of the original stories.

So why did I give it 4 stars?  Honestly, I really don't know.  There is just something charming about it.

You have to go into the movie with the understanding that it is a sy-fy movie and is going to be campy.  Once you accept that, it is really quite fun.  I enjoyed it more than ""Tin Man"", probably because it is not quite as dark and has the romantic-comedy story line weaved in it (also, being 2 episodes instead of 3 makes it easier to watch in one sitting).

4049039,5,B0031DDG9A,"W/ several all stars sprinkled through out this version of Alice is guarenteed to go above and beyond your expectations. I was so excited to see that SyFy was doing a version of Alice in Wonderland mostly because Andrew Lee Potts was cast as Hatter. They managed to get a winner w/ Tin Man so I was hoping Alice would b just as good if not better. And they exceded my expectations cause lets face it most of what they churn out movie wise is guilty pleasure/cheesy B quality @ best. If u liked Tin Man you'll love Alice it's more fast paced and the story is more detailed and flows more smooth. I liked their take on Wonderland. People in Wonderland can't feel emotions so they drain people from our world whom they call Oysters. Alice falling back through the looking glass is foretold to b the one who can take the Queen down.

Here's the beginning of the story Alice's boyfriend Jack gives her a ring then she chases a pig-taild white haired man(he's late late for a very important date) + stumbles through the looking glass. Falling into Wonderland she gets marked as an oyster and crated away to the Hearts Casino, the Queen of Hearts headquarters. Managing to escape she stumbles upon the Wall Street of Wonderland were emotions r traded likes stocks. This is were she meets Hatter(the Mad Hatter). Hatter helps her in her journey to find Jack. I won't give the rest away but will tell u this the ring is more than just a ring and some people r more then they seem to b.

Caterina Scorsone was great playing Alice as a brash, take charge kinda girl. She can hold her own in a fight mentally as well as physically. But the whole time I was waiting for Andrew Lee Potts to make his intro as Hatter. He did not disappoint. I love him as lovable/wonky Connor on Primeval and as Hatter he steals every scene he's in. Potts makes this version of Alice memorable. You'll catch yourself eagerly awaiting his next scene. Alice and Hatter seem to have a spark from the get go and you spend the rest of the movie wanting them to realize their attraction to one another.

The BD is a bittersweet release with an outstanding clarity but a disc bereft of anything - not even a trailer. The picture was solid throughout, with line definition, color and saturation all being tuned just right. The shortcomings do show through with this clear of a pic (the reflection of the green screen studio in every flamingo shot, the knight's horse taking a bathroom break instead of running, sunglasses showing crew and stages, tire tracks everywhere, backhoes in the background, etc.) but it is still fun to watch. The DTS gets a great workout and by the end of your invested three hours this will have given your display and channels a fair test.

The performances are all adequate and the main question has been what age group would start to be interested in this, and I have found 12 & up to be the most captivated.

I love that her costumes weren't over the top or incredibly silly.  She looked lovely and I thanked god for the minimalism.  As all will trumpet, Hatter will get to you.  He had me the moment he turned around.  Andrew Lee Potts took the roll and made it memorable.  And as the other reviewers would profess, he's not bad to look at either.  Harry Dean Stanton as the Catepillar was a welcome little surprise, and Matt Frewer as the White Knight echoed Don Quixote in my mind, which made his character ever endearing and hilarious and show stealing.  Plus, the Jack of Hearts as a blondie... pretty cute too.  The only thing I had to do a double take on was Alice's fear of heights which magically appears only AFTER she meets Hatter and he promises to take her to Dodo.  Apparently all that running around up high before hand never allowed the idea of fear to pop into her head, so I'll let that indiscretion slide.  It just felt awkward to have her suddenly afraid of heights where it hadn't been introduced before.  Even after she was a captured Oyster.  If you haven't seen this yet, you'll see what I mean when you do.  Worthy of purchasing.  Enjoyed this much more than Tin-Man which had a lackluster ending and creepy daddy touchy feely on daughter moments.  And yes... yes... I will admit it, the ending to 'Alice' touched that feminine girly spot inside me.  Plus her mother's face was priceless.

I accidentally watched this on SyFy--so accidentally that I came in an hour after it started. It's based on the classic tale, so it wasn't too hard to get acclimated. That said, it's a very different story line and I'd really like to see that first hour (and all the rest!) in the very near future.

Andrew Lee Potts=best Hatter ever. Perfect mix of con-man and sweetheart. Alice was believable, especially in the context of Wonderland. The White Knight...think Monty Python meets The Princess Bride. Together, the characters swept me off my feet.

I'd say the show as a whole would rank as an A- on the ""A movie""/""B movie"" scale, but in a perfect way. I wouldn't have wanted it as an ""A movie"" show.

Just as all good fairy-tales do, it starts with the familiar.  For Lewis Carroll's Alice, that was the English countryside; in 2010 USA, it's a martial arts dojo.  Alice is a part-time instructor with a hunk of a lover named Jack Chase. Her mother is named Carol, in a nice nod to the author of the original stories.  In her spare moments, Alice is doing internet searches for her father, missing for 10 years. Look at all the motifs presented in just the first 3 minutes! British male protagonist named Jack, spunky heroine, romance, a quest, and lots of attention to detail, such as the roses - white and red - and Alice's blue dress, to act as foreshadowing or reminders of other Alices.
Swiftly the story takes a dark turn: Jack gets a warning message on his cellphone, then he gets kidnapped, with Alice as a witness. When a dapper, white-haired gentleman with two loooong ponytails - the Rabbit, if you will - played by Allan Gray, tries to warn Alice out of the story, she pursues his vanishing figure through alleyways into a warehouse and... through a looking-glass. As a symbol of reflection and self-knowledge, it signals the kind of adventure Alice will have: no mere picaresque dalliance, but a journey to the interior, to her subconscious and beyond to the soul of the world. Alice finds herself in a place like yet unlike the city she left. There are strange anomalies, depths, heights, and oddities: the helicopter has a carapace; the stock market trades in commodities like compassion and clear conscience. The famous Bottle on the Glass Table makes no appeal to passive Suggestibility, no mere ""Drink Me"" for this Alice. My laughter at what it did say was cut short when I realized Alice is in a padded room - and her peek-a-boo view of the space beyond is ominous. Humans, or as they are called, ""Oysters,"" are brought to Wonderland to be harvested of their emotions, which are pearls of great worth to Wonderlanders.
Stay alert for touchstones, for the Doormouse, the Cheshire Cat, the Playing Cards. References to the poetry of the stories gets included as well. After all, what would Alice be without the Walrus and the Carpenter, the crocodile with gently smiling jaws, or the Jabberwocky? I don't want to give away too many plot details, because their revelations are intrinsic to the story-telling.  But I will say I noticed the distinct Terry Gilliam influence in the visionary aspects.
This is the best SyFy Original I've seen to date. After the abysmal betrayal of Earthsea I was leery of the brand. But I recommend Alice whole-heartedly. The cast members play well together. Allan Gray is perfection, from his mercurial changes of expression to his every movement and inflection. Andrew Pots insinuates himself into your affection.  Phillip Winchester, with his chiseled good looks and charisma, should be cast as a starship captain. Everyone involved, writers, directors, actors, have made a piece of work - a masterpiece - of which they may be proud.",1262217600,5,3360,4.917107583774251
4049054,4,B0031DDG9A,"I used to loathe all things Alice when I was young, but now that I am older and (I would hope) wiser, I can properly appreciate its complex and revolutionary nature. While I absolutely agree that this is NOT the adaptation to view if you are looking for a precise translation of Carroll's masterpiece, it is still worth a watch if only for its fascinating take on his world... Certain characters (i.e., the Queen of Hearts, Dutchess, and Jack) did feel significantly underdeveloped, but the endearing nature of the series's more central characters made up for that. Alice, for instance, is a courageous and conflicted heroine who presents a uniquely badass interpretation of her namesake, while Hatter is a charming standout for his dynamic heroism and consistently charismatic presence throughout. The CGI effects do leave something to be desired, but in its context as a relatively low budget SyFy miniseries, they are detailed enough to paint a very colorful picture of Wonderland as a whole. I think SyFy should consider revisiting this world in the future (with Hatter and Alice, of course), so that viewers have a greater opportunity to explore its many untold stories.

Overall, this miniseries is worthy of your time and energy. It was put together thoughtfully and with obvious enthusiasm, provided you keep an open mind and watch from a contemporary standpoint. I absolutely love its plot twists, both dramatic and romantic!",1262131200,3,1434,5.076271186440678
4049055,4,B0031DDG9A,"I have a soft spot for anything Alice in Wonderland related. I'm not sure why, but I'm glad I do.

As far as SyFy productions go, I thought this was an excellent mini series. It was engaging, exciting, interesting, and entertaining (which is the point of this whole movie industry, isn't it?) The graphics were subpar, but so what? We're not expecting top-notch CGI.

The acting, for the most part, was good. There are some awkward patches, to be sure, but overall it's quite good. It picks up speed as it goes for both the acting and the story. I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever been the least bit interested in Alice in Wonderland. It has very few connections to Lewis Carroll's original stories, but that's what's so intriguing about it. It's a new story, a fresh story, and it works very well with the originals.",1262044800,2,829,4.557046979865772

4049057,4,B0031DDG9A,"There's a girl in a blue dress, a Queen of Hearts, and a a magical looking glass that whisks the heroine into a surreal Wonderland.

But beyond that, don't expect this SyFy miniseries to have much in common with Lewis Carroll's classic novel, ""Alice in Wonderland."" Instead, ""Alice"" is a whole different animal -- a deliciously gritty sci-fi adventure filled with action, romance, monsters psychedelic horrors, and a revolution against a drug-peddling queen. It's a little silly, but still immensely entertaining.

Alice's (Caterina Scorsone) dinner date with her boyfriend Jack (Philip Winchester) falls apart when he offers her an heirloom ring. When she chases after him, she sees him being dragged off by some suit-wearing thugs -- and promptly trips THROUGH a looking glass. Of course she ends up in Wonderland, a world of grimy urban ruins and art deco casinos. And it's ruled by the Queen of Hearts (Kathy Bates), a ruthless tyrant who keeps her populace drugged with emotions from kidnapped ""oysters"" (ordinary humans).

Alice ends up following the eccentric Hatter (Andrew-Lee Potts), who offers to take her to the Resistance -- but when they get there, they discover that Jack's ring is actually the Stone of Wonderland (which powers the transdimensional Looking Glass). Since everybody in Wonderland wants the Stone, Hatter and Alice end up on the run from both the Resistance and the Queen's assassin Mad March. Alice is still determined to rescue Jack and return home, but she soon finds that her boyfriend isn't quite what she thought -- and that one of her loved ones is the Queen's brainwashed slave.

The whole idea behind ""Alice"" is that Carroll's story was real, and that Wonderland has become a very different place in the last 150 years -- crumbling smoky cities, insectile airships, bunny-headed cyborg assassins, and a pair of sadistic interrogators called Dr. Dum and Dr. Dee. It's a far darker, more complex affair than Carroll's books, and that's what makes it so brilliant.

There's plenty of sci-fi action and chaotic battle scenes, including aerial chases, bombing runs and the occasional attack from the grotesque Jabberwock; and the writers keep the complex plot flowing along nicely. But they also keep the story grounded with a love triangle between Alice, Jack and Hatter, as well as Alice's quest to free the oysters and a long-lost family member. And there's just enough humor to keep it from being excessively grim (""We don't have to use a user manual, do we? I HATE user manuals"").

Problems? A few of the homages (the grinning cat, the ""drink me"" bottle) are pretty superfluous, and the siege of skeletal soldiers is kind of silly (especially the ""Hit them with everything we've got"").

Scorsone makes an excellent modern Alice -- intelligent, capable and capable of butt-kicking her way out, but still vulnerable and young (""You don't remember me!""). Potts makes a deliciously quirky, sexily disheveled Hatter, and Frewer rounds out the main trio as a mildly insane White Knight. Winchester and Colm Meaney are also excellent, Tim Curry is brilliant but underused, and Kathy Bates absolutely rules as the casually cruel, petulant Queen. And yes, she does say ""off with his head!""

I don't know what beloved children's story will get reworked next, but ""Alice"" does a great job with Lewis Carroll's classic novel -- lots of action, a touch of romance, and just enough surreality.",1261872000,13,3418,5.047872340425532
4049058,4,B0031DDG9A,"This ""Alice"" is certainly NOT for the children of the household! This is not a tarted-up Disney movie. There is violence, drug references, war, intrigue, abductions and a lot more you really don't want to have to explain to your younger offspring. (Or have them have to explain to YOUR parents.)
I was truly awed by the show. The physical sets were very well-crafted and remarkably realistic in the CGI scenes. The story was gripping and very plausible for a fantasy tale. The many references to ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" were often very subtle (see how many of you can find the ""Mock Turtle"" on the first try... (hint: look for a little lady and a BIG gun!)). Some were patently obvious and unnecessary to drive the story. Others were a name-only reference to a character from the stories, like the Dodo.
There were some unanswered questions and some plot holes in the story line, but the story moves so fast you may not even notice until after the program is over.
All in all, ""Alice"" is very entertaining and worth owning. I enjoyed it so much that I pre-ordered it the moment I found out the release date!",1261872000,26,1118,4.623115577889447
4049059,5,B0031DDG9A,"I know i made a review of Alice before but I just wanted to say the cast alone makes this dvd a must-buy.
I believe the dvd will be released in March 2010.

So I never really got into the whole Alice in Wonderland story, to tell the truth, I was actually terrified with the story as a child. Anyways Alice is a wonderful and refreshing take on the well known classic and I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. I watched it at about midnight, skimming through the channels until I came across it and for some reason I was hooked at once. Alice is portrayed as a kickass fighting heroine, that's quite different and the story/plot was so exciting and new, I don't want to give it away but there is some interesting bits added to the original.

Summary: So this Alice is a martial arts butt-kicker. She meets Jack who slips her a ring and once Jack is abducted Alice follows, thus leading to her falling down the ""rabbit hole"" or the looking glass. Once there she meets Hatter who wants to help her find her way home. As she learns more about Wonderland and their emotion-extracting economy, her life becomes endangered when the Queen of Hearts orders for Alice's capture. The Queen ultimately wants the ring Alice recieved from Jack to power the looking glass. Along Alice's journey to find Jack, she also meets The White Knight who accompanys the duo to the Casino(where the captured humans are extracted) while also running away from the Queen's men: White Rabbit and the Suits. Quite an adventure.

Okay back to characters: I must say the acting is top-notch, so great for SyFy to get these incredibly talented actors. First Caterina Scorsone as Alice is amazing and this is my first time watching her, but I am really impressed by her acting. The White Knight(Matt Frewer who is another great star who works perfectly in Alice) is there for some comical parts, and very fun to watch too. Kathy Bates as the Queen, I get what I expected knowing her previous work. The whole cast, Tim Curry, Phillip Winchester, Colm Meaney, etc. is great but the one person that MADE it for me is Andrew Lee Potts as the Mad Hatter. Cute, funny, adorable and most of all he is the one character you can sympathize with (also watch him in the sci-fi show Primeval!) I mean he practically steals every scene he is in. Pott's Hatter is so likable opposite of Scorsone's skeptical Alice that I would watch this just to see the two of them and their <spoiler> romance! He really surprised me with his fun cool side yet it was his sensitive and ""mushy side"" that just left me wanting more. Now I am curious to see Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter...

The SyFy series Tin Man, was a similar miniseries that I saw a few years back(not sure how long) but I really enjoyed the show and the concept behind it. Alice is much like Tin Man, since it is by the same people, but I think it is slightly better and less gloomy.

The cinematography is also perfect, many beautiful scenes but some might have something to say about the CGI. It kind of bothered me that the CG wasn't too amazing but considering it is SyFy, that is just a very miniscule issue and never took away from the show itself. The small attention to details is exceptional too, if you pay attention you can tell how amazing the level of depth is- from the clothing to the buildings.

Basically the show is fun, bizarre, unique and a truly fantastic adventure. I highly recommend a watch.
One last note: the ending ROCKED! and did I already mention how awesome Hatter was....",1261785600,13,3505,4.477308294209703

4049063,5,B0031DDG9A,"I didn't really know what to expect from this mini-series after giving up on Tin Man half-way through - it didn't grab me at all. But for the most part this was a great show and I can't wait to buy it.

THE BAD: Because yes, there was a bit of bad. Firstly, the plot got totally bogged down in the middle where they seemed to be endlessly running away from or to the casino. I got the feeling that there was a bit of padding going on there to make the whole thing long enough to be a mini-series.

As someone else has said, the minor characters (Caterpillar, Dodo, Jack, the Duchess) were a bit sketchy. And really, giving top billing to actors who are only in the thing for a few minutes is misleading and very unfair to the leads.

The Queen's dress/muumuu, call it what you will. She looked like a zeppelin!
Some of the insertions of things from the book seemed a bit random and forced (like the Cheshire cat).

THE GOOD:  I thought that the whole re-interpretation of the book was very well done. Imagining Wonderland 150 years on and turning it into a grimy dystopia was a smart move and very much in tune with the 21st century. The makers managed to capture the hallucinatory, disturbing nature of the original book while making the characters much more human and believable and (IMHO) likeable.

The casting of the three leads was spot on and between them they carried Alice through some of the less than believable moments in the plot, as well as having great chemistry as a team.  The ending was a perfect demonstration of this, and no doubt many viewers were shedding a tear by that point!

THE ADORABLE: The Hatter, and the relationship between him and Alice. I never much liked the original Hatter as a kid, he was just scary. Andrew-Lee Potts' Hatter was roguish, eccentric, charming and valiant and a total scene stealer. Brilliantly acted. Several million viewers have fallen head over heels for him and its easy to see why. If Syfy are paying ANY ATTENTION AT ALL then Potts should get top billing on the dvd, because ultimately it is his performance in this film that carries the whole thing.

My dearest wish is to see ""Return to Wonderland"" turning up on Syfy in the next couple of years - but ONLY if they can get the original leads again!",1261353600,,2259,4.463592233009709

I have to agree with just about 99% of these reviews.  This is probably the best-acted Syfy series that I've seen.  I, like many others, did not particularly dig Alice in Wonderland, but my husband is a fan, so we watched it while wrapping Christmas presents.  I went from half-paying attention, to watching the entire show even after my husband left to go play on his computer.  And like just about every reviewer I credit my interest to Hatter.  What a cutie!  Seriously, they could not have found a better Hatter!  He gives every line a comic twist and every emotion plays on his face.  By now everyone knows he and Alice are the two that hook up, and the writers paced that romance perfectly.  Yes, the ending is AWESOME.  I also really liked that Alice had ripped-up arms and kicked ass and that Tim Curry had a part (albiet small) in this great, mainly English cast.  Tim Curry could read the phone book and still make it a bit sinister.  He is always wonderful in anything he does, and so is Kathy Bates.  Hatter definitely steals the show though, with his little charming behind, and I CAN'T WAIT to bring this movie home!

But this miniseries is refreshing.

It's fresh, it really is.  Watching this doesn't feel at all like watching (or reading) any of the other 100 million Alice in Wonderland re-makes out there.  It approaches the story with a unique vision, but it doesn't pull very far away from the book.  In fact, those who have actually read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass will find that almost every little aspect of the actual books is used in a unique fashion along this wonderful ride.  Things like the poem 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' and 'The Jabberwocky' both have as much influence on this show as the story itself, much to my personal delight.

I'm also big on story and characters.  If the characters don't grab me, I'm done.  If the story is lackluster, I will not recommend it to anyone.  So the fact that I'm writing this review at all shows that the characters and the story were both entrancing.  The characters are almost nothing like their book counterparts (even while, at the same time, they are), but they are really easy to connect to.  Especially the Hatter.  Watch it.  You'll know what I mean.  And the story is nothing short of awesome.  It's unique, it's got great pacing, and it has the best ending.  Seriously, I cheered at the TV.  Out loud.  When a show makes me yell at the TV in a POSITIVE way, you know it's good.  XD

This version of the classic Lewis Carroll stories is amazing.  I was truly blown away by the special effects, the story and of course the acting.

Speaking of acting, this was cast perfectly.  Hatter (played by Andrew Lee-Potts) was one of my favorite characters, not only because he was gorgeous to watch, but because of his acting.  He reminded me a lot of Johnny Depp which is interesting, considering the fact that Depp is going to play Hatter in the new Tim Burton movie.  Kathy Bates as the Queen of Hearts was terrific as always.  I was particularly impressed with Caterina Scorsone as Alice.  She really did a wonderful job.

The story is basically a modern telling of both Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass.  It was great to see nearly all of the characters from the books and a few quotes from the books.  At one point in the movie, Hatter says ""Why is a raven like a writing desk?"" which was a nice nod to Lewis Carroll.

I cannot wait for the DVD to come out.  I will definitely purchase it.  For anyone who enjoyed reading the stories and/or watching the Alice in Wonderland movies, this version of Alice will be worth buying.",1260662400,,1321,4.441666666666666

That said, it's a very different story line and I'd really like to see that first hour (and all the rest!) in the very near future.

Andrew Lee Potts=best Hatter ever. Perfect mix of con-man and sweetheart. Alice was believable, especially in the context of Wonderland. The White Knight...think Monty Python meets The Princess Bride. Together, the characters swept me off my feet.

I'd say the show as a whole would rank as an A- on the ""A movie""/""B movie"" scale, but in a perfect way. I wouldn't have wanted it as an ""A movie"" show.

What casting, Liked everyone in the series. - esp the girl who played ALice, what a spirited character, she wasn't screaming or not trying to defend herself-. Refreshing! and she had a lot of chemistry with the Hatter, I loved them together-. He was a delight too. I enjoyed him and hoped he didn't get shot. -or killed. - Kathy bates did an amazing job as Queen. ! - I always enjoyed her work too. - Though I do wished that Tim Curry had a longer roll , since he is amazing too as a villian.

It may not have followed the original but the original has been done so many times it needed a change and personally it was for the better.  I've never been a fan of this story but with the acting and the adition of NOT trying to make it a kids story it creates a great miniseries...just whish it could have been longer.,1260576000,,406,4.17948717948718

4049078,5,B0031DDG9A,"I just loved this adaptaion of Alice Through the Looking Glass, as I did the Wizard of Oz adaptation, Tinman, that came out a few years ago. (even though I just discovered it this summer)  I liked Alice even more than Tinman in fact, I think mostly because I can't remember how the story plot for Alice goes, and the Wizard of Oz I do know, so the story direction kept me guessing more.  Although, from what I understand, even if I did know the whole original story, this version was changed enough to still keep you wondering what will come next, and I did really like seeing how they put their own interpretational spin on the origingal characters and situations (the ones I could remember and identify at least).  That was what I liked most about Tinman.  Some of the Alice scenes were incredibly creepy, which I thought was nicely keeping to how creepy the original story was intended to be.",1260489600,,895,4.506172839506172
4049079,4,B0031DDG9A,"The problem with most modern attempts at Alice in Wonderland is that there is little new creativity beyond sets, costumes and acting performances.

I think directors and producers are loathe to mess with the classic story formula.

I applaud writer/director Nick Willing for taking a serious turn of pace with how he imagined the world of Wonderland and its characters. He certainly brought more personal depth to a few of the characters and added a good deal of contemporary fun to the story.

When we sat down to Part One of the series I told my husband that I'd hold Mr. Willing personally responsible if the adaptation sucked (I felt rather disappointed with 2007's Tin Man...Sy-fy's take on Oz). But as I noted above, it was quite good, in my opinion.

My husband and I particularly enjoyed the character of the White Knight. Matt Frewer's acting was superb.

I admittedly rather liked the character of Hatter. It was quite interesting to see him as humanized as he was. And Andrew-Lee Potts is cute as a button to boot. I hope to see him in other mainstream projects.

Points of 'strain' included fitting the resistance into the storyline, in particular some of its related characters, like Dodo.

The way Alice played into the resistance's plans was a bit of a stretch but generally worked for me.

And there were only a small handful of dialog moments (mostly Alice's) that I was like ""Too preachy.""

Otherwise, this was an entertaining 3.5 hours (thanks to DVR) of TV time.

Nice work to all parties involved.",1260403200,4,1518,4.759541984732825

4049081,5,B0031DDG9A,"I saw the commercials for this show and was immediately interested. I was not a big fan of Alice in Wonderland, not the books or even the Disney version. But I absolutely LOVED this adaptation. It is so new, not the cookie cutter stuff you see anywhere else on TV anymore!

Everything about this show was great. The casting, the characters, the way the plot progressed and the slow blossom of the relationships between the characters. The ending was absolutely perfect.

I CAN NOT WAIT until this comes to DVD!",1260316800,,510,4.655555555555556
4049082,5,B0031DDG9A,"First off, if you're expecting an adaptation of the classic children's story, you're not going to get it. This a more of a spin off. It's an entirely new story based in Wonderland with a woman who happens to be named Alice, but is not the original. So what did I think over all?

STELLAR CAST AND ACTING - Caterina Scorsone just shines as Alice. She strikes a perfect balance between appearing independent and well adjusted while showing hints of vulnerability and fear that have arisen from a past event. Her emotions were pure and her dialogue very natural. She did an excellent job.

Andrew-Lee Potts as ""Hatter"" commanded the screen whenever he was on. The chemistry between him and Alice was some of the best I've seen in a while. It rang completely true and had me filled with anticipation all movie long for something more to happen. Andrew-Lee Potts is an incredible actor and also very easy on the eyes. If you want some excellent suspenseful romance, this is the movie for you!

There are too many other great actors too name. Truly, all of the acting was brilliant in this film.

SPECIAL EFFECTS - They aren't the greatest special effects. but when you consider that they're part of a low budget movie...erm...a low budget, SCI-FI movie at that, they're not too shabby. I love this modern take on Wonderland with it's mix of trashy urban high rises and spectacular countryside.

PLOT - If you're looking for a deep thinker, you won't find too much to ponder on here. Sure, a prominent feature of this movie is social commentary about the dangers of seeking instant gratification but it's sort of minimized by the strange measures with which it is achieved. There are certainly many interesting questions that arise during viewing about Wonderland itself, but unfortunately many of those questions are not answered. I don't know if the writer's didn't know how to answer them or if there simply wasn't enough time. Although the movie didn't feel rushed to me, I would have loved for it to be longer and more thorough in addressing some glaring plot holes. One is left to speculate just a little too much on this and that at the end. But perhaps it's more fun that way?

SUMMARY - To me, this movie is mostly about the growth of characters and that's why I loved it so much. We see Alice coming to trust deeply for the first time in a very long time, Hatter who learns that doing the right thing is more important than doing the safe thing and a knight who finds the courage to finally make things right. This movie strikes a good balance between character growth, romance, quirkiness, humor and action. It's enough to overlook any other faults. It will leave you grinning from ear to ear.

I'm glad I waited so I could see it all at once.  As previously said Andrew Lee Pott's made the show.  I am also glad that Alice was portrayed as a dark haired kick ass heroine.  Blondes are so over played.  I really loved this short series and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  If anyone knows the release date, please post it.  I signed up to wait for an announcement, but I would like to know how long I must wait to see it again.  I too really enjoyed the ending.

Much like with Wizard of Oz I always got upset as a kid that it took them so long to get home. I grudgingly agreed to watch this movie with him but ended up enjoying it way more than he did. The main reason being the character Hatter. As another reviewer said, ""The whole cast is great but the one person that MADE it for me is Andrew Lee Potts."" His Hatter was quirky and adorable. You like him from the moment he's introduced on screen and you fall in love with him as the story unfolds. I love the romance aspect that was thrown in.  I can't wait until this is released on DVD. In the meantime it will remain on my DVR lol.",1260316800,34,746,4.074829931972789
4049086,5,B0031DDG9A,"I never really got into the whole Alice in Wonderland story, to tell the truth, I was actually terrified with the story as a child. Anyways Alice is a wonderful and refreshing take on the well known classic and I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it. I watched it at about midnight, skimming through the channels until I came across it and for some reason I was hooked at once. Alice is portrayed as a kickass fighting heroine, that's quite different and the story/plot was so exciting and new, I don't want to give it away but there is some interesting bits added to the original.

Summary: So this Alice is a martial arts butt-kicker. She meets Jack who slips her a ring and once Jack is abducted Alice follows, thus leading to her falling down the ""rabbit hole"" or the looking glass. Once there she meets Hatter who wants to help her find her way home. As she learns more about Wonderland and their emotion-extracting economy, her life becomes endangered when the Queen of Hearts orders for Alice's capture. The Queen ultimately wants the ring Alice recieved from Jack to power the looking glass. Along Alice's journey to find Jack, she also meets The White Knight who accompanys the duo to the Casino(where the captured humans are extracted) while also running away from the Queen's men: White Rabbit and the Suits. Quite an adventure.

Okay back to characters: I must say the acting is top-notch, so great for SyFy to get these incredibly talented actors. First Caterina Scorsone as Alice is amazing and this is my first time watching her, but I am really impressed by her acting. The White Knight(Matt Frewer who is another great star who works perfectly in Alice) is there for some comical parts, and very fun to watch too. Kathy Bates as the Queen, I get what I expected knowing her previous work. The whole cast, Tim Curry, Phillip Winchester, Colm Meaney, etc. is great but the one person that MADE it for me is Andrew Lee Potts as the Mad Hatter. Cute, funny, adorable and most of all he is the one character you can sympathize with (also watch him in the sci-fi show Primeval!) I mean he practically steals every scene he is in. Pott's Hatter is so likable opposite of Scorsone's skeptical Alice that I would watch this just to see the two of them and their <spoiler> romance! He really surprised me with his fun cool side yet it was his sensitive and ""mushy side"" that just left me wanting more. Now I am curious to see Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter...

The SyFy series Tin Man, was a similar miniseries that I saw a few years back(not sure how long) but I really enjoyed the show and the concept behind it. Alice is much like Tin Man, since it is by the same people, but I think it is slightly better and less gloomy.

The cinematography is also perfect, many beautiful scenes but some might have something to say about the CGI. It kind of bothered me that the CG wasn't too amazing but considering it is SyFy, that is just a very miniscule issue and never took away from the show itself. The small attention to details is exceptional too, if you pay attention you can tell how amazing the level of depth is- from the clothing to the buildings.

Basically the show is fun, bizarre, unique and a truly fantastic adventure. I highly recommend a watch.
One last note: the ending ROCKED! and did I already mention how awesome Hatter was....

But when I heard that this was from the makers of Tinman I couldn't resist. And I absolutely fell in love with this miniseries.  But don't expect your traditional Alice in Wonderland.  If you're not a fan of changing up traditional stories, this is not for you.  But if you want to see an amazing, original take on Wonderland, this is something you cannot miss.",1260230400,,484,4.528735632183908
4049090,1,B0031DDG9A,"First off, prospective viewers should know that this bears very little relation to Lewis Carroll's works; there are names and situations lifted from both ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"", but the plot only has the thinnest of similarities, and the characters are changed almost out of recognition.  The dialogue has virtually nothing of Carroll's cleverness or punning, and the plotting is quite straightforward and conventional, with the ahead-of-its-time absurdist/surrealist flavor of the originals pretty much jettisoned.  Now, I've got no real problem with ""adaptations"" that are very loose, particularly when they're of older stories like these that have already been turned into dozens of other films, tv shows, comics, etc; what's the point of doing ""Alice"" again if you aren't going to do something new and interesting with it?  The question isn't whether it's ""faithful"", but whether it's good.

So then, if it's not a straightforward adaptation, what is it and what does it give us?  We have Alice, a 20-something martial-arts instructor in New York with a boyfriend who tries to give her a special ring as a present, which she rejects as she's not that serious about him yet.  He takes off, leaving it behind, and when she goes after him to return it she sees him kidnapped, follows and ends up going through the looking-glass into Wonderland - here mostly a series of skyscrapers with canals running between them and some vaguely steampunk-influenced technology.  She quickly meets the Mad Hatter and goes on a seemingly endless series of chases trying to first find her boyfriend, and then defeat the nasty Queen of Hearts (who is of course Kathy Bates) who is stealing people from our world and bottling their emotions as happy drugs.  Adventure, action and romance ensue, and lots of really terrible CGI, with the flying pink flamingos being the worst.  The acting is mostly mediocre even from professionals like Bates, saddled with a British accent that comes and goes, and Tim Curry who is just there because, well, he's Tim Curry and he gets these kinds of jobs.  The great Harry Dean Stanton is also wasted in his 5-minute walk-on as the Caterpillar.  ""Alice"" Caterina Scorsone is good at looking pensive, annoyed and tearful; the only real saving grace here is Matt Frewer as the White Knight - he belongs in a much better film.  I can't really blame the other actors much though, they aren't really given any opportunities to develop characters with any sense of reality, even the childish reality of the characters in the original stories.

This is another woeful example of the current throw everything-but-the-kitchen-sink at viewers mentality that seems to infest an awful lot of science fiction and fantasy films in particular.  Enough FX and action and we'll forget the plot inconsistencies, poor acting, and half-assed storytelling - at least, one assumes that's what director/writer Nick Willing, the producers and SyFy were thinking.  Use a popular, well-known and public-domain property like ""Alice"" (or ""Oz"" as in the same people's TIN MAN from 2007), make it ""darker"", fill it with cute lead actors and the tween girls and boys who are the most desirable demographic won't notice that there's really nothing there.  Add in elements of other pop-culture detritus, like THE MATRIX (the Mr. Smith-like Suits, in particular), some 60s-type mod costumes and bright colors for the casino sequences, maybe a bit of BRAZIL and 1984 - or BRAVE NEW WORLD with its similar happy-drug 'Soma"" - for the artsy cred, and you've got yourself a movie!

Well, no.  You've got yourself a bunch of ill-fitting disparate elements in search of a real story, and I would think that even some of the younger viewers (espcially those who have read Carroll's originals) might see that.  Matt Frewer's performance, and the eye candy of Charlotte Sullivan as the Duchess aren't enough to raise this up to a second star.  It needed a coherent, interesting plot and characters, some reason to exist beyond cashing in on Tim Burton's soon-to-be-released film also based on the story - and also featuring a grown-up Alice and a Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) who seems to have been rather influential on the look of the Hatter in this adaptation.  But all glossy surface and no meat certainly isn't enough for this viewer, especially when the glossy surface, given SyFy's low budgets and the bland direction of Mr. Willing, isn't all that great to begin with.",1260230400,32,4486,5.018867924528302

A breif summary:
Alice Hamilton (Caterina Scorsone) is a young, martial arts instructor with commitment issues. At the age of ten, her father left the family without warning or word and it's had long-lasting effect on her. She has high hopes that her new love, Jack Chase (Phillip Winchester), might be ""the one"" but when he offers her a spectacular engagement ring that has been passed down for generations in Jack's family, true to form, she panics and sends him packing...directly into the arms of a mysterious, well-dressed gang of men who are out to nab Jack and the valuable jewel. Realizing that Jack has slipped the ring into her pocket before leaving, Alice pursues one of his captors, a man in a white suit.
Alice follows the group through a smoky mirrored portal -- a looking glass -- and soon realizes that she has slipped into a parallel universe where the Suits, led by White Rabbit, bring people kidnapped from our world into Wonderland. There, these ""Oysters"" as they are called, have their memories erased and are held captive in a casino. As they gamble, their extreme emotions of joy, delight, excitement, etc. are drained from them and bottled for consumption by the citizens of Wonderland. By feeding these positive human emotions to her subjects, the Queen of Hearts (Kathy Bates), like the Roman emperors of old, maintains her stranglehold over Wonderland with her husband, the King of Hearts, at her side.
Desperate to find Jack, Alice enlists the help of the shifty Hatter (Andrew-Lee Potts), who runs the tea shop where Wonderland's denizens get their fix. He takes her to see Dodo (Tim Curry), a prime figure in the resistance against the Queen's rule. Unfortunately, things turn sour, as Dodo's zeal leads him to attack Alice and Hatter. Escaping, the duo make their way into the wilderness, where they flee the horrible Jabberwocky and meet the White Knight (Matt Frewer), the last of an order of warrior-inventors tasked with protecting the now-fallen Kingdom of the Knights.
Unfortunately, the forces aligning against them are formidable. Hearing of Alice's arrival, the Queen suspects she still possesses the ring Jack offered to her. The ""Stone of Wonderland"" is not only a treasured gem but is also needed to operate the looking glass. Without it, there is no way to control the portal in order to collect new Oysters and maintain her reign. The Queen charges some of Wonderland's more dangerous characters, including her pet assassin Mad March, to capture Alice and retrieve the ring at all costs.
Realizing that her only hope to find Jack is to attempt to deal with the Queen, Alice leaves behind her companions and is captured by Mad March. She's presented to the Queen and offers up the Stone in exchange for Jack...only to be shocked when it's revealed that Jack Chase is actually Jack Heart, the Queen's son! Separated from her friends and under the Queen's power, Alice is left in peril and pondering new mysteries being revealed about her past and her family.",1260230400,,3308,4.835978835978836
