Usually Im not fond of the action/adventure genre because there has to be something about the plot or main character which transcends the mere good guys fight the bad guys theme. Fortunately, Charles Crichtons Hunted has that something special and even though the premise of the film may seem too simple on face value, what he constructs is a richly layered and deeply moving film about a mans quest for redemption.

Chris Lloyd, a poor sailor, shoots a man in a fit of passion for having an affair with his wife. A little boy named Robbie goes down the vault and sees the murder so Chris snatches him away. It turns out Robbie is running away from his foster parents because they beat him whenever he makes a mess or breaks something so in a way, he is better off with Chris. At first Chris is cold and rough with Robbie and tells him to go home but when he discovers Robbie has no place to go, he slowly learns to love him and does everything in his power to make sure the little boy is protected. When Robbie is dying of exhaust and starvation in the wilderness, Chris hugs him tight and begs his forgiveness for dragging him into his mess. He steals a boat and rows back to London so he can turn Robbie over to the care of the authorities and indict himself.

What makes this movie so endearing is the strength of character Chris showshow it would have been so much easier to kill Robbie to get rid of the witness and save his skin. But instead, he chose to take the highroad and put Robbie first and then go back and take the punishment for his crimeeven if it meant the hangmans noose. There are not a lot of men in his situation who would have done all that.

Dirk Bogarde is not only strikingly handsome but does an amazing job pulling out the layers of Chris troubled yet good hearted character. He portrays joy, sorrow, anger, worry and care all in a manner that is very real. I was touched beyond words at his acting and often wept at his performance. The scene where hes telling Robbie the bedtime story in the country hotel Once upon there was a sailor who met a pretty girl is a real kick in the gut because even though he tells it in third person you simply KNOW he is talking about himself. And even though you know hes a murderer, the way he slowly chokes up and then buries his face in the pillows so Robbie won't see him cry when he gets to the part about how his wifes lover taunted him What do sailors marry girls for? makes you almost glad he pulled the trigger. You even wonder if Chris really deserves to die for doing what any ordinary human being would have been tempted to do under the circumstances. The scene with his wife is especially powerful. Even though he threatens her as he sneaks into her bedroom, he still hugs and kisses her passionately before packing up because deep down he still cares about her. She feels bad and offers him a pearl necklace he could pawn while hes on the run. When the police question her she refuses to tell them anything because deep down she knows she had a role to play in the pebble that set the ripples of his demise in motion.

Charles Crichton directs with a steady hand and infuses a gritty sense of realism not uncommon for British films of that era.

Five stars for this obscure yet luscious little gem.",1456876800,,3373,4.370015948963317
8586520,5,B00CUDD0LG,I absolutely loved this movie!  I will only say you have to watch it; Bogarde is great and the little actor Jon Whiteley was believable as the little Robbie.  I don't want to give too much away.  This movie was enthralling; it will remain one of my all time favorites.,1434672000,2,268,4.32
8586521,5,B00CUDD0LG,"One of the most enthralling and haunting British films ever made starring the wonderful Dirk Bogarde as fugitive Chris Lloyd and Jon Whiteley as  6-year-old Robbie. I've never seen a more convincing or flawless performance by a child actor either before or since. This film could easily have become mawkish  in the wrong hands (think Hollywood), but thankfully there's not a hint of schmaltz or sentimentality to be found.
I've watched many an old B&W British film in my day, and this film for me, is one of my two most-memorable for all the right reasons (the other being Brief Encounter).",1431993600,3,590,4.8316831683168315
8586522,5,B00CUDD0LG,"We've waited a long time for the wonderful HUNTED (1952) to be released in a  reg. 1 DVD for the US and Canada.  Yes, we could play the reg. 2 in a multi-region player.  But thanks to VCI Entertainment, now we can play it in the US in any computer and TV and give it as a gift without worrying about a special player.

Thanks to VCI and also for including a photo gallery.  HUNTED has some wonderful shots of Dirk Bogarde and little Jon Whiteley, just the sort of photos you'd want in a photo gallery.  A very nice perk on the DVD.

If you haven't seen the dark, edgy HUNTED, you are in for a treat.  Dirk Bogarde puts in a powerful performance as Chris on the run who drags along another runaway, little Robbie who thinks he's set his house on fire.  They're an unlikely, on-the-road couple whom you will grow to understand and feel affection for.  Directed by Charles Crichton, whose start as a film editor for Alexander Korda, gave him added perspective in filming and the wonderful, atmospheric cinematography by Eric Cross.

A film not to be missed.",1393027200,4,1054,4.409326424870466
8586523,5,B00CUDD0LG,"I've only seen this movie once in the late fifties when it was shown on TV overhere in Holland, but it was one of the Dirk Bogarde movies I liked best and John Whitely was another great asset. It was a touching movie that one never forgets. I've waited for it being released on DVD until now. There were already a few DVD's available of this movie but none of them had english subtitles which I need. This one has, allthough it is not mentioned on the Amazon site, but look at the VCI site who are releasing the movie. Ofcourse I can't give an opinion about the quality of the DVD but most of the VCI releases are very good. I should say, don't miss this one, you won't regret.",1371945600,9,677,4.175572519083969
