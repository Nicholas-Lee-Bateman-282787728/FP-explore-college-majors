8143166,5,B000I2IUM0,Sarah Walker is amazing and dos a stunning job with the part of Elizabeth I - she is a real artist of the highest quality and Britten would certainly have adored her!,1442188800,2,166,4.21875
8143167,5,B000I2IUM0,"I must admit being a fan of Elizabeth I.  Not historically, but in terms of her character  both in film and opera.  One cannot Listen to ""Gloriana"" without going back to Donizetti's ""Roberto Devereux"", ""Maria Estuarda"" and ""Ana Bolena"".
But, on the other hand, there is a classic of cinema very much present: ""The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex"", with one of the best Elizabeths of all time: Bette Davis.  And I am almost sure that Sarah Walker did study Davis' portrayal of the aging, imperious queen.  That said, she is a total actress/singer, ably surrounded by a stellar cast and an visually sumptuous production.",1381363200,2,623,4.839622641509434
8143168,5,B000I2IUM0,"I own the other two versions of this Opera on commercial release. I have to say that the Opera North (heavily edited) version has wonderful psychologically arresting performances. However, this 1983 ENO production has better vocalists in all the central roles. Whilst I prefer the emotional intensity of the Opera North production (Barstow is as fine an Elizabeth I as any on stage or screen), the drama is just as high in the ENO production because the vocalists are so fine; Sarah Walker has a steadier voice than Barstow's rather more 'superannuated' one. However, the orchestra is the most powerful recommendation for this DVD. The intensity of the orchestral performance is a revelation.

This is a glorious sounding Gloriana and has made me realise how special this opera is. This is far from being Britten's 'damp squib' composition. Indeed, I find it a work of great beauty, both subtle and thrilling. The finale is terribly moving. Britten surpassed himself for dramatic intensity in what was a composition of genius. This production helps us see just how good the opera is in the right hands. I recommend it. However, if you have the resources buy the Opera North one as well.",1242864000,28,1186,4.93
8143169,5,B000I2IUM0,"Both musically and dramatically I found this to be a very satisfying rendition of Britten's Coronation Year masterpiece.  Sarah Walker's performance of the title role is a tour de force and the others in the cast support her well.  The production, using a single unit set, is well conceived and appropriate.  Recommended highly.",1171497600,14,328,5.150943396226415
