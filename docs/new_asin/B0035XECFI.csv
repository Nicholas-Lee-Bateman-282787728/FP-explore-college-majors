4071747,5,B0035XECFI,"The Hollywood Collection of various movie stars from the baby-boomer age and prior, tells about the lives and biographies of various movie stars, their lives, the hardships they went through while struggling to become an actor and the sometime successful
rewards which may come out of this industry. Burt Lancaster, was no different, he was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, had a
moderate to difficult life but inspite of adversity went on to succeed in the film industry. He was a very excellent actor, one with good range, somewhat stubborn, and often wanted directions from the director done his way!!! Never-the-less, he was a fine actor and gave good performances in most of his character roles. I am 60 years of age and I have been watching Burt Lancaster films since I was a child. One of my favorite movies of his was, ""From Here To Eternity"", with Debra Kerr and Birdman of Alcatraz. He always had that tough guy bravado in many of his films, but, he could always diversify each character when needed. He was excellent in Elmer Gantry, him and Gene Simmons. These biographies of the great actors from the Hollywood Collection on DVD is well worth the money and a wonderful addition to having quality films in your library. You will not find them in your public library,
you will have to purchase them and they are well worth it. Enjoy them!!!

4071754,4,B0035XECFI,"Burt Lancaster started his storied career as an anti-hero in 40s Film Noir drama and an athletic action hero playing roles that would have gone to Errol Flynn a decade earlier. However, he was savvy enough to realize he couldn't be an action star forever and wanted to grow as an actor.

He began to alternate his physically demanding, swashbuckling roles like ""His Majesty O'Keefe,"", ""The Flame and the Arrow,"" ""Ten Tall Men,"" and ""The Crimson Pirate,"" which relied on his training as a circus acrobat, with serious dramas with more veteran co-stars like Joan Fontaine in ""Kiss the Blood Off My Hands,"", Shirley Booth in ""Come Back, Little Sheba,"" Anna Magnani in ""The Rose Tattoo,"" and Katharine Hepburn in ""The Rainmaker.""

Lancaster usually came off second best to these more experienced performers, but he was learning the craft of screen acting from these seasoned players while maintaining his original fan base as he developed those skills. Ultimately Lancaster evolved into a superb screen actor with an Oscar for ""Elmer Gantry"" and nominations for his two finest performances in ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" and ""Atlantic City."" He continued to keep his legion of fans happy with his more boisterous roles like ""The Professionals"" and ""The Scalphunters.""  I can't think of another actor with that kind of career arc.",1382140800,3,1319,5.0691244239631335

4071756,5,B0035XECFI,"Burt Lancaster was the man John Wayne wanted to be.  He was a great actor with tremendous range.  He took rolls because they were interesting and challenging.  More importantly, he embodied all the good qualities we think of when we use the word ""man"".  He was the real deal.",1368489600,,275,4.551020408163265

8389289,5,B0035XECFI,"This is a most definitely one sided look at the life of this star, and make no mistake, Burt Lancaster was a major star in his day. Using archival footage and interviews from people in the industry who knew  and liked him, having worked with him professionally, as well as an interview with the daughter of one of his oldest and dearest friends, this take on Burt Lancaster is basically a love letter to him. It is all laudatory with nary a bad thing said about him other than he was a perfectionist with a bit of a predilection for usurping the director's role, at times. No mention is made of his numerous affairs nor his three marriages. Still what was said was of sufficient interest to make me want to see some of his movies again. This show manages to make the viewer feel as they should fall in love with Burt Lancaster, who was so very handsome and virile by any standard. So, despite its obvious lack of objectivity, the show was a most enjoyable viewing experience of a star who is gone but not forgotten.",1495152000,,1015,4.398936170212766

8389296,3,B0035XECFI,"A general sketch of his life and career with no real insights. Fun to see the movie clips. It inspired me to buy ""The Flame and the Arrow.""",1475971200,,139,4.0
8389297,4,B0035XECFI,"One of the acting world's best. A good account of Lancaster's life and so many great movies. I think I saw them all and it brought back great memories of great times.  Nothing compares with Elmer Gantry or the Rainmaker and the list goes o.  No one on stage or screen today can compare with Burt Lancaster
.  Four stars because of who it was about and as a biography may 3.5.  If you hadn't seen his movies or been familiar with himeI'm not so sure it would be enjoyable.",1474848000,,471,4.2
