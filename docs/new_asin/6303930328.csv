728779,5,6303930328,"I have used this tape so many times, it's beginning to wear out.  It's a toning tape that really focuses on all of the major muscle groups and I've seen great results.  For beginners, it even provides a bit of a cardio workout.  The one problem I have is that now that I know the tape and don't need ""breathers"" in between various exercising, I find that the instructor takes too long between each set as she describes the next exercise.  This detailed explanation is, however, what appealed to me when I started the tape.  I've now made up for the delay by starting each set early.  I'd recommend this tape for someone with limited workout time who would like to see more definition to her muscles.",969926400,6,699,4.464566929133858
728780,2,6303930328,"This workout tape is a bit old fashion, the cover picture has nothing to do with the contents. Exercise, Background colors,  and music all were boring. In my opinion it could be suitable for beginners.",959040000,2,201,4.742857142857143

7855417,3,6303930328,"Debbee Sharpe leads you through this half hour routine which is not a bad one for those with limited time.  There is a variety of exercises which hit all the muscle groups in a short time, some of these being compound movements which work the upper and lower body at the same time while providing a little extra challenge.  You will need one set of dumbells ranging from 2-10 pounds.  Debbee and her crew appear to be using anywhere from 2-5 pound weights, one of them being a man who is pointed out to be using slight heavier weights.

You start out with a simple warmup, then you move into the standing portion of the workout starting with plies with upright rows, then you will do some calf raises, then more plies with front deltoid raises, some of them alternating.  Then you will move into a set of lunges, first alternating legs, then you will do static lunges on one leg, then the other leg with more alternating lunges in between.  There are some pulsing reps for the static lunges which add a little more intensity.  The standing work concludes with step squats in combination with bicep curls, one legged squats and one arm tricep kickbacks, and rear deltoid raise.  The entire sequence is repeated a second time.

Once you are done with the standing work, you move to the floor for more weight work starting with pec flies, then ribcage pullovers.  Then you lose the weights briefly and do some hamstring work with ankles crossed, heels on the floor and toes in the air.  Then you grab your weights again and repeat these exercises again.  Finally you do some brief ab work, traditional crunches with some tempo variation, reverse crunches and oblique twists are what you will see in this segment.

Debbee Sharpe does a decent job leading this video, she takes time to explain proper form and is pleasant and motivating.  She makes little comments in order to give those an extra incentive to keep going.  This routine is short, but hits everything in the alloted time.  I would consider this routine to be beginner/intermediate level, advanced will not find it challenging.

The only negatives in this video is that it's recorded in EP mode, which I don't quite understand since most of the Crunch videos are recorded in SP mode.  The other one being the whooping of the background exercisers, which is common in Crunch workouts though it is worse in the aerobic videos.  It is apparent that they are having fun, but it's a bit much sometimes and can be distracting for those who are really trying to concentrate on their form, etc.  So if you are one that dislikes noisy participants, you may want to steer clear of this one.",1130630400,3,2639,4.634408602150538
7855418,5,6303930328,"I Love her energy! She has great cues and gives great instruction. The only problems I had with the video were that sometimes she seemed to lose count of the reps she was doing and you wind up doing maybe one or two more on one side, big deal~ You will need 2 to 10 pound weights for some of the workout. I consider this a difficult workout. I sweat through it and my muscles hurt afterwards. That's awesome. The group she has are all different sizes. It's not just a bunch of skinny blonds, which is nice. She is very motivating to lose the weight you want. She's a baby boomer and looks fabulous! I wish they made this on DVD, that's such a shame. To me it's the best Crunch workout available. It's not a bunch of crazy dance moves that are hard to memorize, it's just plain ol' get in shape movements! Keep moving and stay motivated!

7855419,5,6303930328,"I bought this video a while ago and I must say that for a 30 min segment it covers your major areas pretty well.  I build and lose muscle quickly so after just one work out I see results, and can definitely feel it working.  There is a slight lag time but I use that time to take some sips of water or switch my weights or grab my exercise mat for the floor exercises.  My heart rate gets up, I can feel my muscles working, and the ab segment is definitely challenging. All in all, I would rate this video as great for the time that you spend using it.",1072051200,3,552,3.954954954954955
7855420,3,6303930328,"When I first purchased Turbo Sculpt, I was disappointed:  the quality of the video seemed poor and the ""whooping"" and hollering of the participants was annoying.  However, the quality of the workout itself was pretty good, so I wound up using the tape for several years before eventually outgrowing it.  Here's what I liked/disliked about this video:
LIKED
*relatively short (30 minutes) allover toning workout
*alternates upper and lower body toning exercises (or combines the two) rather than doing ALL upper and then ALL lower
*the exercises were challenging but doable
*there were no push-ups
DISLIKED
*the instructor's chattering was annoying
*the other participants are constantly ""whooping"" and hollering in a way that seemed fake
*some parts of the workout are very tough (a long series of bicep curls while doing squats), yet others are too easy (very little focus on triceps; a short abs segment)
*overall, I failed to see major results from this workout
Some of the previous reviewers mentioned that there is not enought cardio on this tape--in fact, there is NO cardio because it is a TONING tape, so if you're looking for cardio, look elsewhere.  Before you buy this tape, I would recommend viewing a clip on collagevideo.com, and if you can tolerate the instructor, you might like the tape, especially if you are looking for a shorter toning workout.  However, I would recommended that you check out Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight instead if you want to see real results.",1022803200,4,1496,5.016129032258065
7855421,4,6303930328,"It's a great workout for those times when you don't have too much time but you want a total body workout. It's great for legs, butt and abs. If you have more time, combine it with a cardio routine for a great calorie burning and toning.",995414400,2,236,4.1521739130434785
7855422,4,6303930328,"I would recommend this video to other intermediate exercisers who are looking for something to do when they don't have time for a 60 minute video. The instructor is energetic, and explains each exercise very clearly. The backup exercisers hoot and holler throughout the routine (as if these buff ladies are really getting tuckered out by a few squats) which might irritate some, but personally I find it entertaining, and it gives me something to chuckle at while I'm working out. The most effective segment is probably the abs, they don't skimp even though its only a 30 minute video. My only complaint is that there is too much lag time- sometimes this occurs because as each exercise is being explained, you're standing there doing nothing. In addition there are these ""motivational"" blurbs thrown in between segments. Of course it dosen't take much sense to realize that you can just keep doing the previous moves until the routine starts up again.",981504000,11,952,4.919254658385094
