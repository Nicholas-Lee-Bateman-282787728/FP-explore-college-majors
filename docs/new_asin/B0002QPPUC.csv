The play did have one flaw, the plot was everywhere and there wasn't any real main problem there were mini problems that were solved kind of quickly. If you're in love with stageplays and like to see the true beauty of stage performance then this may not be fit for you. But if you're not uptight and love to laugh I'd definately buy if I were you.

The play is mainly targeted to the ladies and/or black community, but i gues comedy is a UNIVERSAL laqnguage, anyway I think oyu should get it to see if oyu like it because we all have different views on what's funny, so go out and get you a copy of Shelly Garret's Beauty Shop and see if oyu like it, like i did.",1145491200,,796,4.037974683544304
8079039,1,B0002QPPUC,"The play was not worth the money. The humor is bad and the characters are horrible. This was so unlike the other plays that I've seen. I was really disappointed because I thought it would be better. The camera was too far away and the script was awful. The plot was all screwed up and I kept falling to sleep.

Don't buy it!!!!!",1112918400,3,328,4.2063492063492065
8079040,1,B0002QPPUC,This movie is nothing like the real play that toured the United States.  The humor is bad and the characters are horrible.  This was so unlike the play I was really disappointed because I loved Beauty Shop 1 & 2 (the Play)  Save your money on this one!,1106265600,4,252,4.208333333333333
