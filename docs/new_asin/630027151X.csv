293427,5,630027151X,"Back in the 80's they still knew how to make good comedies (and movies in general) and this is one of the best made that decade. (Followed closely by: ""Stir Crazy"", ""Nine To Five"", ""Hanky  Panky"", ""Tootsie"" and ""Ghostbusters"".) The acting  is wonderful, the music is good, and the story is funny and moving. Winkler  and Keaton are perfect, and I'm actually glad there never was a sequel  because there's no way to top this fine film. -And it's letterboxed at  last. A commentary track on this otherwise nice looking DVD would've been  hilarious and a great idea; how about it, Warner ?.",952905600,,587,4.650485436893204
293428,4,630027151X,Michael Keaton&Henry Winkler did a good job in this comedy. Ron Howard did a good solid job of directing this film. Shelly Long was good in this film as well.this film was far more believable than Pretty Woman.,950054400,,210,4.552631578947368
293429,5,630027151X,"If I meet someone and they love the movie Night Shift, I know we'll probably have a fair amount in common.

293431,4,630027151X,This movie is well worth it for the performance from Michael Keaton in I think what was his first movie. Whether he's talking about prostitution or the Girl Scouts of America he will keep you laughing throughout in this  one.,915408000,,225,4.625

293470,5,630027151X,A time machine back to 80s film making and the start of Michael Keaton's maniac movie career- wild plot yes but Keaton gives one of the freshest and best performances of his long career here.  The dialogue between Keaton and Winkler still holds up after all these years even if the plot stretches credulity.  Worth repeat viewings.  Winkler makes a surprisingly effective straight man not just for Keaton but for every actor he shares the screen with- which just adds to the humor.,1502668800,,481,4.771084337349397

293529,5,630027151X,Night Shift is a fantastic comedy directed by Ron Howard in one of his earliest and most underrated efforts. It stars Henry Winkler and Michael Keaton as Night Shift morgue workers who end up turning the place into a prostitution ring and what leads and follows is loads of laughs and fun. Henry Winkler is great and a star was born with Michael Keaton in his first film who is outstanding as always. Night Shift is another in a long line of very underrated Michael Keaton films. Night Shift was filmed in a very special time when 1970s New York was almost coming to an end. Ron Howard captures the city and the early 80s era magnificently. Stick around for a fantastic end credits overhead shot of the city at night to a great early 80s Rod Stewart song not to mention one of the best opening credit sequences in film history to a great Quarterflash song. Night Shift is one of my favorite New York films and comedies. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to it and can we get a blu ray already?!,1479513600,,999,4.376344086021505

However, this morgue is about to come to life! No, this is not a horror movie. Strictly comedy. Ron Howard(Andy Griffith, Happy Days, Splash, etc.) directs this movie starring Henry Winkler(Fonzie from Happy Days), Shelley Long(Cheers), and Michael Keaton(Dream Team, Batman). This movie is very funny in that two guys have an idea nor before heard of; they convert a morgue into a brothel which leads to all sorts of madcap, hilarious comedy! This movie is rated R for obvious reasons. One other thing; this was Keaton's, Batman himself, first movie!",1456185600,2,710,4.827868852459017

293654,2,630027151X,"Had read great things about this film and Michael Keaton's performance in it, so decided to give it a look. Have to say I wasn't all that impressed... The movie is kind of boring, and Keaton only has a couple of scenes that made me chuckle, but it's just not worth it for those few moments. I much prefer Keaton's second collaboration with Ron Howard, the criminally underrated ""Gung Ho""!",1449446400,,388,4.557142857142857

293656,4,630027151X,"Early Michael Keaton as Billy Blaze (William Blazejowski), one of the best breakout roles for a young comedian.  He really carries the movie from his first appearance channeling the Stones to the end.  Non stop talking in the style of Robin Williams, coming up with one crazy idea after another.

Henry Winkler is good too as the put upon Chuck Lumley, a guy too nice to fight for his own job when demoted to the night shift in the city morgue with his new associate, Billy Blaze.  The two turn the quiet morgue night shift into the night shift for a group of hookers looking for a safe way to make a living in their chosen profession.  Works until they come up against a couple of pimps wondering who is taking over their turf.

The film looks a bit dated with the Blazejowski character listening to music on a now antiquated device and the transfer to DVD is a touch fuzzy - only real reason for 4 stars rather than 5.  Still, good characters who grow rather than stay one dimensional in an early Ron Howard directed film and the humor still holds.",1449014400,3,1050,4.409326424870466

293659,5,630027151X,"Night Shift is historically entertaining. A great ensemble cast with Michael Keaton, Henry Winkler and Shelly Long; the directorial leadership of Ron Horward, and of course Ron's brother, Clint Horward makes his infamous cameo appearance. This period presentation explores the livelihood of pimps & prostitutes, accounting, a montuary and trust. It is worthy of your time and a barrel  of laughter.

and Michael keaton's first film as an Actor
and i tell you Michael keaton is extremely funny for his first film
Shelley Long and Henry winkler also give Great performances to
still is a very very funny movie today
Henry Winkler play's a straight ahead supervisor who works the Night shift at a Morgue for Dead corpses
Michael keaton comes in as his co-worker to persuade Henry's character to become Pimps
 and use the Morgue as a Call girl agency
while they're both trying to pick up Dead corpses at the same time
incredibly funny film, Michael keaton steals the show in some scenes
and so does Henry winkler, they're both a Great team

tragically no new special features at all just a Theatrical trailer
this film was first released on DVD back in 1999 just barebones snapcase packaging with Theatrical trailer
with both full screen & widescreen options
and then some 9 years later 2010 the film gets re-issued again in standard keepcase packaging this time
as shown on this listing
the DVD quality of the film has not changed at all it's the same DVD transfer as the 1999 release
with the same screen formats on a 2 sided Disc, side 1 is Fullscreen 1:33:1, side 2 is widescreen 1:85:1
and the same sound quality Dolby digital mix
the DVD packaging is the only difference actually

it would be Great if Warner bros made the effort to release this film on blu-ray
with new special features like a new retrospective featurette with Ron Howard & Michael keaton & Shelley long
but Don't hold your breath, i'll be surprised if it ever happens
the film deserves at least 4 stars
this dvd release deserves about 2 stars if that
so you either buy the 1999 snap case version of this new 2010 standard keepcase version
they're both the exact same film quality",1417996800,,1836,4.591463414634147

The script, cast, director all come together to deliver a really funny, and at times edgy film. Henry Winkler is terrific and is the soul of this film. Keaton is usually given that honor by many who have seen it, but I think Winkler delivers the goods to make this movie as good as it gets. Ron Howard directs superbly, as always. Keaton is good but his films that follow are much better. Shelley Long gives one of her best performances in this one. It is a hilarious take on hookers, morgues, romance, friendship, blended together in a dark & funny comedy. If your not too prudish I think you'll get a lot of fun and laughs out of it.

The movie will doubtlessly make a person laugh. The story-line may be realistic; I do not really know about that. The nudity is not pretty or even really necessary. Most of us are not lacking in imagination, meaning that nudity could have just as well been implied wityhout someone having to bare themselves before a camera crew, but to each his own. Winkler was great, and Keaton, in spite of his character being a 'character' was kind of sweet.  You will like the characters, I think. It is funny, and would be even funnier to those who find more funny than I so.  There, can I hush now?

293999,5,630027151X,"I liked this cheerful comedy A LOT and I spend a very nice evening watching it - it also helped me recover from some recent extremely unsatisfactory viewings of modern American so-called ""comedies""... Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler, excellent!) a quiet, peaceful man with some secrets in his past, works as an attendant at New York City morgue. He is quite content with his work and life, even if his fiance Charlotte (Gina Hecht, hilarious!) suffers from frequent nervous breakdowns... However, one day he is mutated without notice or explanation to the night shift and receives in the same time for task the training of a new, inexperienced co-worker, Bill ""Blaze"" Blazejowski (Michael Keaton, grandiose in his very first role ever), who turns out to be an irrationally exuberant obnoxious jerk. As if all of that was not enough, a prostitute named Belinda (Shelley Long, disarmingly pretty) moves to the apartment next door - and that brings in also her frequently weird, loud and unpleasant johns... That covers like first five minutes and then the film really begins.

Now, this film isn't of course an immortal masterpiece, but it is a good comedy with many good things in it, beginning with the most crucial - IT ACTUALLY IS FUNNY, something which is not always evident in more recent American ""comedies""... It is also gentle and heart-warming, even if a lot of it turns around dead-bodies, prostitutes, pimps, johns and also two very dangerous thugs... Also, there is virtually no obscenities - and that is a really refreshing thing.

This film was one of earliest directing efforts by Ron Howard, at least for the big screen, and he did VERY WELL indeed. Turned on a budget, the film brought a lot of money and Hollywood noticed - Howard's next two films would be ""Splash"" and ""Cocoon"".

For the main role Howard cast his friend and former co-star Henry Winkler and gosh, did he made the right choice! This is most certainly Winkler's best role EVER! He never makes one false move and we root from him from the first to the last second of this film...

Richard Belzer appears in this film as a dangerous thug and he is great - however his screen time is limited, as it was one of his earliest roles (his big break with ""Homicide"" would come only in 1993). If you have good eyes you will probably be able to recognize Shannen Doherty as a little girl scout and a young Kevin Costner who appears in a glimpse as a frat-boy...

Greatly regretted character actor Vincent Schiavelli appears in a short scene. He is there just to deliver a sandwich - well, it will be one of THOSE deliveries...

This film is very much in love with New York from the 80s, the pre-Giuliani years, when the city was sinking to the bottom - and was darn PROUD of it...))) It is also very 80s and it is a darn good thing, because it was the time of GREAT or at least GOOD  comedies, like ""Airplane"", ""Blues Brothers"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""Midnight Run"", ""Jumping Jack Flash"", ""Trading places"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Gremlins"", ""Splash"", ""Spaceballs"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""Pretty Woman"", ""Princess Bride"", ""Who framed Roger Rabbit"", ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""Look who is talking"", ""Scrooged"", ""A fish called Wanda"", ""Risky business"", ""Working Girl"", ""The witches of Eastwick"", ""The war of the roses"", etc.

Sadly, it was also the LAST decade when Hollywood managed to produce so many good comedies. Since 1991 until now the number of really good and funny comedies declined (although, as ""While you were sleeping"" and ""My big fat Greek wedding"" prove it, they are still sometimes being made) and they were mostly replaced by films which I personally cannot stand like almost all of the Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller movies, ""stoner"" comedies and finally by... ""things"", like ""Heat"" or ""Tropical thunder""...  In fact, watching ""Night Shift"" was a kind of remedy to recover from the anaphylactic shock I suffered after watching in rapid succession ""Heat"" (the one with Sandra Bullock) and ""Tropical thunder""... I discovered at that occasion that I am clearly allergic to cr@p, because I almost DIED! Watching this film helped me - A LOT!

So, bottom line, this is a good, funny, heart-warming comedy - and that is an exploit, considering that a lot of the action occurs in a morgue...))) A film to buy, watch and keep. Enjoy!",1399852800,2,4350,4.825503355704698

294282,5,630027151X,"NIGHT SHIFT was supposed to launch the Fonz as a box office presence. Instead Michael Keaton hijacked Henry Winkler's mojo and was the one who ended up putting Hollywood on notice. The early '80s gave us three similarly-themed pictures: DOCTOR DETROIT, RISKY BUSINESS, and NIGHT SHIFT, and they are all worth eyeballing, even though I think NIGHT SHIFT is graced with a cast that is warmer and more endearing. Director Ron Howard, at this stage still finding his way, instills a humanizing touch. Howard's background in situational comedies really pays off here.

Even though he's a financial wizard, quiet and fastidious Charles Lumley (Winkler) chooses to be an attendant at the New York City Morgue, preferring the low key work atmosphere to the frenzied hubbub of Wall Street. Charles is what is known as a milquetoast, a pushover, a human doormat. He's stuck with a girlfriend who's more into dieting than into him. Each day a vicious dog chases Chuck to his apartment door. When the local deli gets his order wrong, he doesn't raise a fuss. Demoted to the graveyard shift, Chuck is assigned a new partner, the fast-talking, big-dreaming Billy ""Blaze"" Blazejowski (Keaton, in his film debut). Maybe it's inevitable that one of Billy's big ideas would rub off on Chuck.

Chuck meets a nice neighbor right across the hall, Belinda Keaton (Shelley Long) who is a hooker. When Belinda's pimp gets himself fatally defenestrated, leaving Belinda and her friends without management or protection, Chuck - who is crushing a bit on Belinda - finds himself persuaded by Billy to take up with the world's oldest profession. And what better venue to conduct business than in the city morgue at night? Apparently, in this reality, in the wee hours, corpses are hard to come by in New York City. It's a shady enterprise, trading one set of stiffs for another. The girls go along because Chuck and Billy are only asking for ten percent of their take. And again Ron Howard's deft touch takes the edge off the premise, allowing you to root for the hos. Besides, Shelley Long is a wholesome enough lady of the evening that even Julia Roberts wants to cut her. Still, it's a terrific change of pace for Shelley Long from her snooty, over-intellectualized role of Diane Chambers in CHEERS. I have never liked her more than in this film.

But no one plays a more diametrically opposite part than Henry Winkler. His Chuck Lumley is about as removed from the Fonz as you can get. There's a chance that this may be his very best performance. Still, he comes close to being overshadowed by Michael Keaton's manic presence. Keaton is a whirling dervish of a chatterbox and there's so much energy on screen during his scenes. The story gives him beats in which he demonstrates likability and heart, which temper what could have been too much of a good thing.

NIGHT SHIFT has its farcical side. I mean, the premise is about a city morgue that at night transforms into a brothel. But there isn't a mean bone in the humor. Howard respects his characters. Winkler, Long, and Keaton are really fantastic together, and I am frankly surprised that Winkler wasn't able to parlay this into bigger things in Hollywood. And if you want more star power, look for very brief glimpses of Kevin Costner as a frat boy and a very, very young Shannen Doherty as the helpful Bluebird scout who blows the whistle on Chuck in the elevator.",1321056000,,3397,4.772108843537415

294408,4,630027151X,"Watching Michael Keaton's performance in Night Shift is kind of like watching Marlon Brandon in A Streetcar Named Desire. In spite of excellent performances by his co-stars, Brando's performance clearly shined in a league of its own charisma and creativity. Keaton's performance in Night Shift is kind of like that, but, of course, on a lot less influential level. Outside of Keaton's star-making performance, Night Shift is still a very good movie, but it looks very dated today -and Shelly Long is hardly believable as a hooker. On the other hand, Henry Winkler is funny and highly likeable as the ""nebbish"" lead Chuck Lumley. But, much like Vivian Leigh in Streetcar, you rarely hear people mention his performance.

People remember Night Shift as Michael Keaton's movie, because, much like Brandon in Streetcar, he steals the show. Considering Night Shift was made way back in 1982, one can make an argument for Keaton's performance as a precursor to arrested development, slacker, dreamer, visionary lovable-loser types like Kramer and most every part Owen Wilson has ever played. In short, the attributes of Ron Howard's direction and the performances of Henry Winkler and Gina Hecht (as Lumley's hysterically neurotic weight-obsessed fianc) all deserve their due, but ultimately Night Shift will always be remembered as Michael Keaton's movie.",1242691200,,1350,5.308411214953271

294410,3,630027151X,"'Night Shift' was the first major release for film director Ron Howard. A child actor, best known for playing Opie Taylor on 210 episodes of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" from 1960 to 1968 and Richard 'Richie' Cunningham on 171 episodes of ""Happy Days"" from 1974 to 1984; he wisely chose to work behind the camera, thus avoiding the ""Different Strokes Syndrome"" of child actors who aren't so cute as adults. It stars his fellow actor from ""Happy Days,"" Henry Winkler, who must have been trying to break out of his typecasting by playing the polar opposite of his well known character Arthur 'Fonzie' Fonzarelli. Where Da Fonz is supremely confident, Chuck Lumley (Henry Winkler) is a doormat who works at the morgue, but was once a stock broker and financial advisor. When his boss hires his incompetent nephew to take his place and moves him to the night shift he is too much of a wimp to complain.

His new partner, Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) is an idea man. Though most of his schemes are hare brained, he thinks they are golden and preserves his rambling inspirations on a tape recorder.

---------------------------------
Bill Blazejowski: I'm an idea man Chuck, I get ideas, sometimes I get so many ideas that I can't even fight them off!
======================

One scheme he cooks up that actually works (for a while at least) is to use the quiet city morgue as a base for a call girl operation. He also rents out the hearse as a limo. He is full of ideas, and even though he is a maniac, I was inspired by his example, and also aspire to be an idea man (note to self: get a digital recorder so I can have it with my at all times if the odd million dollar idea should strike).

Besides Keaton, Shelley Long as Belinda Keaton is the other reason I enjoyed this film. The film was released the same year as ""Cheers"" debuted, and is a great chance to see Dianne in her Chambers. There is just one scene that is really good where she makes scrambled eggs for Chuck since they both get home from work in the early morning hours.

For a movie that combines call girls and the city morgue, ""Night Shift"" is surprisingly mild. But what would you expect from Opie, anyway? Still, this is a good start for a director, and Ron Howard has certainly improved immensely since this early effort. I am hearing a lot of good buzz for his latest film, ""Frost/Nixon.""

294414,5,630027151X,"I'm surprised by the number of people that can quote Animal House and Caddy Shack inside and out, but never saw this movie.  The other 5-Star reviews do a great job capturing the fun and charm of this movie, which at it's heart is a romantic comedy, but don't let that fool you!  Keaton, Winkler and Long make a wonderfully endearing and hilarious team.  Darn good little story too-- well crafted and doesn't fizzle at the end like most comedic movies do.

And if I had to pick just one comedy from this era (other than Animal House), it'd be this one hands down even over the other well-known classics like Caddy Shack, Stripes, Weird Science, Ridgemont High, Sixteen Candles, 10, Ghost Busters, etc.

This is a classic from that great era, and if you haven't seen it, it'll be like finding a hidden gem.",1204070400,3,805,4.524137931034483

294466,5,630027151X,"This is a classic Keaton/Winkler film that will stand the test of time.  No matter how many times I view this film, I still enjoy the zany Keaton character ""Billy Blaze"".  Winkler adds a fine performance as well, taking you from his inability to stand up for himself to when he finally grows a pair with his family and soon to be ex- fiance.",1180051200,3,341,4.3125
294467,3,630027151X,"Night Shift is the cinematic rise to fame of Michael Keaton. After a lot of tv work, this was his first big film role, and he tackles it with all out manic excitement. As Bill Blazejowski (aka Billy Blaze) Keaton is the new guy on the night shift at the morgue with Henry Winkler (playing Chuck Lumley, a superb straight man).

When Lumley's neighbor Belinda (Shelley Long as a kind-hearted prostitute) loses her pimp - I mean, he gets killed, she and the rest of the prostitutes under his umbrella are without protection in a dangerous profession. She asks Lumley for help, and together with Blazejowski, they come up with the idea to use the morgue as their home base for a prostitution ring.

Thus the stage is set for Ron Howard's Night Shift, a slapstick comedy with a few touching moments that keep the characters toeing the reality line, while remaining slight caricatures and driving a bigger-than-life story of friendship, love, and, of course, pimping.

The casting is superb. Look out for a young Kevin Costner as Frat Boy #1 in a party scene at the morgue and an even younger Shannen Doherty as a girl scout.

Night Shift is definitely an entertaining ride, but it does have a strong 80's feel to it, and although it's super fun to watch, I can't give it more than three stars in 2007. Plus, the DVD is one of those early releases that just features a menu with Play DVD, Jump to a Scene, and audio setup. Without special features, some DVDs just aren't complete these days.",1179878400,6,1486,4.575187969924812
294468,5,630027151X,"I first saw this movie when I was about 14, I think, and it's one that I still love, that I have seen probably at least 100 times, and one that my brothers and sisters and I still quote and reference.  ""LOOOOOOOOVE BROKERS"", ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", ""Call Starkist"", ""Where the **** is 4-K"", ""Oh, she's a harlot"", the definition of Prostitution, and ""This is CHUCK to remind BILL to SHUT UP!"" are all burned in my brain and still make me laugh to this day.  And, since I grew up in Indiana, it's always a special treat to see the Kugels, especially Mrs. Kugel barfing out the window of the car after having seen a man's bare butt.  This movie is a scream - it does not disappoint.  Plus, if you grew up in the 70s or 80s, there are a ton of people in it you'd recognize.  Clint Howard is especially funny as a high school kid who rents out the morgue ""limo"" (hearse) to go to the prom.  Michael Keaton (as ""Billy Blaze"") is absolutely hysterical.  I love this movie and I recommend it to people all the time!",1138060800,13,1005,4.230366492146596
294469,5,630027151X,"What can I say about this classic that hasn't already been said?  Truly one of the funnest movies I've ever seen.  I laughed out loud from the moment Michael Keaton appeared on screen until the credits. The funniest scene in my opinion was when Keaton (at the morgue with a room full of prostitutes) uses the chalk board to explain the definition of the word ""prostitution"" by breaking the word down....

""What are we talking about here?  I'll spell it out if I have to.  Prostitution.  We can say it.  We're all adults.  It helps to understand a word if you break it down.  First there's 'Pros'... well, that doesn't mean anything really... then there's 'Tit'... we all know what that means... and then there's 'tu'...tu tit and then there 'tion' from the latin word to shun...to push away! To say NO I don't want any...that really doesn't belong in this word...  Hilarious!  Check it out!  You won't be disappointed!",1135900800,5,918,4.66875

294472,5,630027151X,"Ron Howards jump from good boy image to this film is wonderful. Billy Blazejowski is one of the funniest characters on film. Michael Keatons film debut. Good hearted, not raunchy, but good laughs that have you rewinding so you don't miss the next scene. To see the Fonz as a wimp is gratifying. My fav. scene, Billy posing for his mugshots. Too funny. Also when Billy decides to use the hearse as a limo picking up prom kids and diplomats. When the prom kid, Jeffery shows up,(Ron Howards brother, Clint), and Winklers character says to Billy, "" Its a limo for dead people."" Billy responds, ""So...did you see that kid."" I LOVE THIS FILM. Pick this dvd up and enjoy a honest, funny flick that hits the funnybone. Todays standards this would be PG 13, no bad language, a quick glimpse of breasts, big deal, one hell of a funny film. ""Why not just feed the tuna fish mayo?...Call Starkist."" Enjoy, you won't be let down. A bit of trivia for ya, the annoying saxaphone player on the subway is actually the director, Ron Howard, pretty cool huh! Kenin Costner is the frat boy behind Billy when he is balancing a beer on his head. Shannen Doherty is the Bluebird in the elevator screaming mugger at Chuck. Great 80's soundtrack with Quarterflash and Rod Stewart, buy this film, you will not be let down by no means. A comedy classic.",1119225600,5,1327,4.533333333333333
294473,5,630027151X,"First of all, I need to say that this movie is a classic. It's got everything you could want from a plot like it has. Winkler and Keaton are fantastic in their roles. The music is great and just overall a good movie to check out. Now I know people tell me Costner is in the morgue frat party scene but I can't seem to find him. Could someone tell me what part exactly to look at. I didn't think it would be that difficult to spot him but he must only be in the movie for a few seconds. Anyway, if someone could let us know that would be great. So, if you're looking for a classic comedy and havn't seen this, I recommened it.",1106524800,12,625,3.9682539682539684
294474,5,630027151X,"I haven't seen this movie in 20 years, but it has still stayed with me.  It's one of those blessedly funny films that you can watch while your brain is on autopilot. Ron Howard has really created a fine comedy here.  Chuck works as a director in the local morgue.  He's a good guy, but he's as stiff and uptight as the corpses.  Yet he has a decent-paying day job and a loyal, if shrewish and carping, fiancee.  If he can put aside bad sandwiches and aggressive dogs, it's not a bad life. All that changes when he's bumped from his cozy day shift at the morgue -- the plum job has gone to his employer's nephew -- to the night shift to work with Bob, his diametric opposite.  Brash, loudmouthed, and annoying, Chuck can barely tolerate him.  Chuck, however, forms a friendship with a kind prostitute named Belinda, and with the death of her pimp, he agrees to implement one of Bob's wild schemes: to run an escort service for Belinda and her sister prostitutes out of the morgue. Everybody's happy and making lots of money until a prominent pimp, who is peeved at missing out on a piece of the action, pays Chuck and Bob a visit.  This is a fine and very entertaining movie.  Check out the theme song from the short-lived early-80's pop band Quarterflash!",1050624000,8,1255,4.445414847161572

294538,5,630027151X,"Night Shift was the first major release for recent Academy Award winning director, Ron Howard.  For the film's star he recruited his old Happy Days friend, Henry Winkler, to star.  In addition to Mr. Winkler, he featured two unknowns, Michael Keaton & Shelley Long to co-star.  The film centers around Chuck (Mr. Winkler) as real pushover, who works the night shift at a New York City morgue.  Nothing in Chuck's life is going right, his finance is a demanding shrew, he gets bumped from the day shift to the night shift as his supervisor's young nephew takes the preferred time slot, he never gets the right sandwich he orders and his neighbor's dog chases him down the hall everyday.  His new neighbor, Belinda (Ms. Long), is perfectly lovely, but she turns out to be a hooker.  His new partner, Bill Blazejowski (Mr. Keaton), is a loud mouthed, pushing ""idea"" man, who is always coming up with one harebrained scheme after another.  Chuck secretly falls in love with Belinda and when her pimp is killed and she is beaten up by a customer, Chuck gives into Bill's idea to become Belinda and her friend's pimps and operate out of the morgue.  Mr. Winkler is very funny playing against his Fonzie role, but Mr. Keaton steals the entire film.  He explodes off the screen as the manic Bill and just about every line he utters is hysterical.  The film made him a star and he kept up the funny roles until Batman.  Mr. Howard does a superb job helming the film as it is perfectly paced with virtual no dead spots.  The film's closing credits feature Rod Stewart singing the original version of ""That's What Friends Are For"" which of course, a few years later, would become a huge hit for Dionne Warwick and Friends.",1017273600,36,1711,4.6105610561056105

294541,5,630027151X,"This is one of those movies that is so well written and funny that you find yourself quoting the lines for years.  Michael Keaton and Henry Winkler work great together in this unfortunately VERY under-rated film.  But one of the best aspects about this movie is the fact that although you'd expect a great deal of gratuitous sex and nudity after reading the description, there is virtually no sex in this movie and the nudity is limited and almost non-existent.  Ron Howard obviously devoted more energy to a plot and writing than he did to cheap sex and nudity; a smart move.  I recently bought one of those hand-held mini-recorders for all the ideas I have floating in my head.  The first thing I said into it to test it?  Naturally, it was:  ""Hello, this is Chuck, to remind Bill to SHUT UP!""",982627200,8,795,4.5174825174825175
294542,5,630027151X,"If you've never seen this little known Ron Howard film, do yourself a  favor and go rent it for $0.99!  This was a groundbreaking piece for both  Howard and Keaton, and this quality of wonderfully demented humor hasn't  been paralleled by either to date.  Keaton pulls off a brilliant  performance as a down-and-out lout alongside Henry Winkler, who turns in a  great performance as an ultra-conservative simpleton battling his fianc  over his inability to commit to just about anything.  Jobs as a morgue  attendants provide the zany dichotomy necessary for Keaton to twist  Winkler's ultra-conservative character.  A laugh a minute from start to  finish; you won't be disappointed if you like truly classic Keaton comedy.",969321600,5,723,5.182608695652174
294543,4,630027151X,"How do you make a funny movie using a morgue and prostitution as subject matter?  Leave it to screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who put a rollicking script in the hands of director Ron Howard, who ran with it  and ended up scoring a minor comedy classic with ""Night Shift.""  Chuck  Lumley (Henry Winkler) is in something of a funk; he's been relegated to  the night shift at the morgue where he's worked for years, thanks to the  nepotism of his boss, who has installed a nephew into Chuck's day shift.  Now Chuck has to train the new man, one Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) a  real ""idea man"" who can't sit still and never seems to quit talking, much  to the chagrin of the conservative Chuck, who likes to keep things quiet  and simple.  When Chuck befriends Belinda (Shelley Long), a neighbor in his  apartment who just happens to be a prostitute, Bill gets wind of it and has  an idea.  Belinda and her friends are in a dangerous business, and they  could use some help and protection.  Nights at the morgue are slow, and  they have a limo at their disposal (Sure, it's a hearse, but slap a sign on  the door, and you're in business).  Bill convinces Chuck that they could  make a fortune as ""love brokers,"" working right out of the morgue.  And  soon Chuck's life will never be the same.  Keaton is absolutely  spectacular as Bill (""Call me `Billy Blaze'""), in whom he has created a  totally off-the-wall, quirky, uniquely nuanced and endearing character  you're never going to forget.  He pulls out all the stops and never quits,  playing perfectly off of Winkler's reserved and cautious-to-a-fault Chuck,  the perfect foil for Bill.  The timing between these two is right on the  mark, and Howard keeps the pace steady and the laughs coming.  Wisely, the  story avoids any moralizing or delving into the murky waters of the subject  matter; after all, this is a comedy, not ""Taxi Driver,"" and Howard never  lets it slip even close to leaving the laugh track.  He keeps it light and  funny and makes sure the characters are real people; there's no buffoonery  or slapstick here, and it keeps the real humor centered and at the heart of  the story.  Shelley Long, too, adds a nice touch with her spin on Belinda,  the hooker with the heart-of-gold.  The supporting cast includes Gina  Hecht (Charlotte), Pat Corley (Edward), Bobby Di Cicco (Leonard), Nita  Talbot (Vivian), Clint Howard (Jefferey) and Joe Spinell (Manetti); and  look closely for Kevin Costner as a frat boy in the party scene at the  morgue.  Howard gets high marks for making ""Night Shift"" a memorable  comedy, and for keeping the dynamic Keaton on track to deliver one of the  most singular performances of his career.  This is a movie with heart, and  most importantly, plenty of laughs.  You'll be glad you didn't let this one  pass you by.",960076800,34,2832,4.673469387755102
294544,5,630027151X,"This early Ron Howard effort is somewhat forgotten in the aftermath of his big-budget hits that have come in the last decade.  That is too bad, because this is probably Howard's best comedy and it is one of the funniest  movies you will ever see.
The story centers on Chuck Lumley (played by  Henry Winkler), a nebbish who works at the city morgue after leaving his  high powered finance job due to stress.  Chuck is a loser who cannot face  up to any kind of bully, including his fiance.  After being relegated to  the night shift, Chuck is teamed with a morgue new-comer, Bill Blazejowski  (Michael Keaton at his maniacal best).  Bill, who likes to be called Billy  Blaze, is ""an idea man"".  When Chuck's prostitute next-door  neighbor (Shelly Long) loses her pimp, Bill's new idea is to use the morgue  to run a call-girl ring.  Doesn't sound funny?  Well, trust me, it is  hilarious.
Keaton steals the show with his over-the-top performance.  His high-energy comedy is the perfect contrast to Winkler's nerdy Chuck.  Winkler, in a departure at the time from his Happy Days role as the Fonze,  is also dryly funny.  The supporting cast (most of whom made their mark on  t.v., not movies) is also fantastic.  The prostitutes, lead by Long,  combine looks and humor.  Richard Belzer (Homocide), Pat Corley (Murphy  Brown), Gina Hecht (Mork and Mindy) and Derek Munoz (Freaks and Geeks) are  among those who provide memorable moments in small roles.  Clint Howard as  usual has a role in his brother's film and is very funny as a loser who  employees the services of Chuck and Bill.
And, as a previous reviewer  noted, this movie is ripe with great, quotable movie lines.  Those who love  to quote movies to friends will find rich material here.
This DVD is  priced low, and would make a great addition to any collection.  This is a  very funny movie from Ron Howard's early career.  Get a copy of this one.",958003200,35,1907,4.652567975830816
294545,5,630027151X,"This is my favorite movie, which seems wierd, I was only 5 when Night Shift came out.  Star Wars had a hugh effect on my youth at that moment in time.  So why did I like this movie?  I just remember Michael Keaton being a live action cartoon.  I didn't even understand what I was watching. I think I saw Night Shift for the first time when I was like 8 and I loved it. I didn't get all the humor at first, which isn't too hard to believe, but again I thought Michael Keaton was a trip.

As I have grown older, I've  started to understand the humor in this film and I loved it. Also, no matter how many times I watch this movie I pick up on another aspect I didn't notice prior. The acting between Henry Winkler (Chuck) and Michael Keaton (Bill) is great.  Ron Howard's (first job) directing is super!  This movie takes place in one of the most gloomy places, a morgue.  However, this doen't have any effect on the comedy at all, as a matter of fact it only adds to the paradox of the film.  Which is two men running an escort service where dead people ""are in transit"".

I always found it funny that this was my favorite movie and still is.  Which seems weird because Star Wars had such a hold over my youth and still does today.  The Star Wars films will always be my favorites, but Night Shift is a classic.  I believe the term is ""DA BOMB""!",953856000,,1343,4.115384615384615
