8022096,1,B00024JBWW,"Got it at Wal-Mart in the really cheap section, yeah, I shoulda' known better.  The video is very grainy and the audio is not even stereo quality in my opinion.  This video really sucks.  That is not to say that Pavarotti didn't do a great job, he probably did his best as usual, but you can't feel it with this poor quality recording.  Very bad, save your money and get the ""Original Three Tenors"" Concert first.",1106524800,12,413,4.394736842105263
