793659,5,630411222X,"This is my all time favorite funny movie. I must have seen it about 50 times, and it hasn't gotten a bit old.  I laugh so hard I cry.  This isn't slapstick humor, it is suddle and that's what makes it so great!",1054944000,3,210,3.86046511627907
793660,3,630411222X,"This movie almost looks like memento ripped off of it.  This guy has temporary amnesia, and the plot unfolds as the movie goes on.  The plot is very well thought out and clever, revealing something new each minute, but there is one problem.  This movie is supposed to be a comedy, and tries hard, but fails to deliver the laughs.  There are many desperate attempts at humor in this movie, but only about 3 times does it work.  But nonetheless it is an enjoyable 90 minutes, and although it wastes his talent, as one of the few movies Dana Carvey stars, and he is usually so funny, but in this movie he just doesnt deliver.",1009584000,3,622,4.373913043478261
793661,5,630411222X,"I loved this movie, I think its genius.  It has depth, detail, atmosphere, and is hilarious with clean humor (which is kind of refreshing).  A great vehicle for Carvey (and I'm not a huge Carvey fan), I can watch it again  and again!",960249600,9,233,4.372093023255814
793662,2,630411222X,"The comedy CLEAN SLATE runs hot and cold.  Its director, Mick Jackson, has made at least one gem (L.A. STORY) and one dog (THE BODYGUARD), and he's between those extremes this time around.  CLEAN SLATE's worth a try on  television as opposed to buying or renting.

CLEAN SLATE's imaginative  premise involves the plight of lead actor Dana Carvey, who doesn't remember  anything previous to his last night's sleep.  Before we even get to know  his character, the film rushes into the story of the daily amnesia attacks,  one reason it took me some time to start enjoying the film.  Further,  several weak plot devices and too many one-note characters strain the  credibility of CLEAN SLATE's otherwise fun, clever story.

While its jokes  hit or miss, CLEAN SLATE does not waste the comic talents of ""Saturday  Night Live"" funnyman Carvey.  However, it is lead actress Valeria  Golino who, playing the friend Carvey may not be able to trust, carries the  film.  She certainly has the advantage of playing CLEAN SLATE's only  three-dimensional role.

CLEAN SLATE ain't bad.  With some rewriting here  and some editing there, it could have been even better.",954720000,4,1154,4.957894736842105
793663,4,630411222X,I thought this movie was awesome. I've always thought Dana Carvey was a hilarious actor and this movie was just as funny as he. I recommend it!,951177600,,143,4.333333333333333

793754,5,630411222X,"This movie is hilarious, but no one ever saw it, or if they did, they didn't like it or they don't remember; but people are dumband getting dumber all the time. If you're less dumb than those people, youll like this movie because it will make you laugh, and for one brief moment, youll forget how dumb everyone is and how much that pisses you off.",1433462400,,347,4.2727272727272725

793762,5,630411222X,"This is definitely an oldie but goodie movie.  It has romance, comedy, action, and Dana Carvey is adorable! He is a private investigator with a type of amnesia that causes him to forget everything whenever he falls asleep.  This is quite problematic, especially when he is in the middle of a murder trial, involving some pretty bad guys.  Throw in a beautiful woman, played by Valeria Golino, and his little dog (wearing an eye patch), and all you need is a comfy couch to sit back and enjoy.",1382918400,,492,4.568181818181818

793826,1,630411222X,"This movie was probably the biggest bomb of 1994. It's a real shame too as it has some talent in it's ranks like James Earl Jones, Dana Carvey, and Kevin Pollak. However, this was very unfunny. Mind you my heart really wasn't into this movie anyway as I had a rejection the night before I saw this, so I couldn't focus into the movie, but there really wasn't anything to focus into here. It's about a guy who has amnesia whenever he goes to sleep, and he ends up witnessing a murder.....what's so funny about that? I honestly feel that this is one of the worst if not ""THE"" worst movie ever made. This was even worse than ""Ishtar"" folks. I don't have any desire to see this again, and I won't own it either. Like I said this was the biggest bomb of 1994.",1251417600,,754,4.206896551724138
793827,3,630411222X,"A clever and funny romp about a detective who's suffering short-term memory loss. Carvey plays it well, and so does the dog. The premise has him trying to make sense of the urgent goings-on around him, and is used to great effect. Don't want to ruin the plot, so just go watch it!

Don't be discouraged by the three stars. I think I gave Saving Private Ryan four.",1229558400,,363,4.338235294117647
793828,4,630411222X,"It's not screamingly funny, but unfortunately it is Dana's best solo starring movie to date.
Carvey and Golino work well together and create real characters out of a pretty one dimensional script. Plus, there's Kevin Pollack who's turned out to be far more talented as an actor than he ever was as a comedian and the ever exquisite Olivia D'Abo (Single Guy (TV), Point of No Return, many bad movies and cartoon voice overs.)
This seems like one of those vehicles that starts with a funny idea, but there isn't the writing talent or maybe just a lack of impetus to develop it fully. It's pretty much a one trick pony.
Robert King needed a writing committee like the writers for the Simpsons to take a basically funny concept and add joke after joke until there was really something there like they did with Groundhog Day.
I saw Pre-SNL Dana live (late '85 or early '86) so I know what it's like to laugh so hard you can't hear all the jokes or breath for that matter. His talent is incredible, but he hasn't has the best of luck in films.
This one isn't terrible, but it will never be on anyone's top ten list either.
(I actually gave 3 stars but I can't figure out how to change it.)",1221177600,,1183,4.381818181818182
793829,4,630411222X,"I have to say when it comes to Dana Carvey, this is one of his funniest. the dog in the movie is actually more of the highlight. A blind dog that has issues of his own, and is quite enjoyable to watch. I believe that children would enjoy this movie as well. (Mainly because there is no nudity :( and the language is pretty calm.) i would actually rate this at 3 1/2 stars, but still a fun one to check out.",1221004800,,406,3.9634146341463414
793830,3,630411222X,"I remember when this came out, I was excited because Dana Carvey had just left Saturday night live to venture into movies, and Who would have guessed that his carear whould have been so short. unfortunately, his characters and impersonations never translated into box office money.  This movie doesn't even try and take advantage of any of his impersonations etc, and is just not funny. We start the film with him waking up and a tape recorder that just fills us in to his amnesia. And then the movie disintigrates from there. Not funny, at times hard to follow, and way cheesy unbelieveable.  But, it was before momento and 50 first dates, so you can say that at least some other films got a chance to do it better.  Anyway, worth a laugh or to, a trip down SNL memory lane, but not a great collection builder.",1183334400,,811,4.503401360544218
