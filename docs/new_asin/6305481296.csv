7892390,1,6305481296,"Actually thought this was the 2008 movie, since it has The White House on the DVD cover, so I imagine that's what the DVD company thought was the film they were distributing, but this is actually an around ten years earlier likely made for TV movie, which has nothing at all to do with the President, Washington DC.  It does have a senator in it as a minor character, but that's it.  My rating has nothing to do with the fact it isn't the movie I thought it was.

There are some spoilers here - It's an odd movie, basically it changes what type of movie it is, it's your typical best women friends swear no man will ever come between them then of course one does that many a made for TV movie plot does.  Then it has a bit of workplace sabotage in a district attorney who wants a senator's who criticises his performances job who has a drug addict for a son he can use.  You've got a sleazy loser character that not only doesn't pay but likes to rob young girl prostitutes of  whatever cash they've got hidden on them.  There's a ridiculous scene where two other customers (or maybe one was the pimp) yell out, ummmmm no or something like that and confront him.  Then the district attorney (who is the guy that comes between the two besties by the way) ditches the blonde one, and keeps going with the dark haired one.  Then one night after she's passed out decides he likes what he sees and to rape the blonde one, she wakes up and tells him to stop he acts like why are you being so annoying and of course doesn't.  Then she turns up the next day confronting him about it and you think he's either going to kill her so she doesn't make it public knowledge or she's going to get back at him somehow but no they just start seeing each other the next day.  In fact while they are making so much noise in bed that the dark haired one comes home, gets angry and pulls a gun on them that ends in her being shot with a bizarre scene where the district attorney keeps yelling at her ""What is that face? I've never seen that face before! as if she's being typical bad communicating I don't know what you're supposed to be telling me""  Then it turns into a covering up a crime movie, then an I know what you did thriller, then a seeing ghost movie, then well it just even stupider, although you can predict exactly how it is going to play out.

That whole summary of some stuff may make it seem like it's going to be entertaining.  Unfortunately it's not, it's actually really slow and boring for the most part..  The pace picks up when that walking in on them in bed scene occurs, but that's with about ten minutes to go and you're going to need something else to do while the majority of the movie is playing to stop you from falling asleep before then.",1483920000,,2747,4.225621414913958
7892391,5,6305481296,"I just saw about an hour of this movie on TV and man is it awful. It was so bad I literally had tears coming out of my eyes from laughing so hard. From what I could gather, an attorney (Corbin Bernsen?) was having an affair. His wife catches him in the act and threatens to shoot him. The gun accidentally discharges, killing his wife, but Bernsen has no clue she's been shot. He keeps screaming something to the effect of ""What's that look for?! What are you trying to tell me?!"" (She's been shot genius) Bernsen and this woman proceed to bury his wife, and it just gets weirder from there.

Most of the movie's humor comes from Bernsen's over the top acting as he screams and bumbles his way through the script's clich dialogue. If you want to laugh, rent this dud of a movie.",1141344000,2,778,4.292517006802721
7892392,1,6305481296,"I took a chance on this because I enjoy Jayne Heitmeyer in Earth: Final Conflict.  She, Robert Vaughn, and Maryam D'Abo all do credible jobs acting in this movie, but their acting and some gorgeous outdoor shots are not enough to save it.  (Note that Corbin Bernsen as the main character did not make the ""credible acting"" list--I haven't seen one man hit himself about the face and head so much since the Three Stooges, but I digress.)
The story is set in Boston.  You can tell this if you watch closely because there's a half-hidden Boston Police patch and one Massachusetts license plate.  Otherwise, it seems pretty clear that everything takes place in Canada. No offense to our friends to the North, but the film comes off as, well, Canadian--which is to say that several scenes are reminiscent of a ""Kids in the Hall"" episode, only not funny.
For a film described as a sexual thriller, there is a startling lack of thrill or sexuality--no nudity except for a brief and obvious glimpse of a body double.  I'm not sure how it earned its ""R"" rating. Interestingly, the DVD box shows a helicopter and the White House (?) but I don't recall seeing a chopper or *any* American building in the entire movie.
To sum up, a weak story, bad acting except the three aforementioned, and questionable direction make this a sophomoric attempt at a film.  I can't recommend it unless you're a *really* big Jayne Heitmeyer fan.",977184000,,1416,4.666666666666667
7892393,1,6305481296,"I'm a devoted fan of beautiful Maryam D'Abo but this bomb is truly awful. There's no dead guy at the White House, no helicopters flying around, no suspense, no believable premise, no coherent plot, no script at all and,  needless to say, no need for you to spend your dough on this  cr@p.
...unless you are a true devoted fan of Maryam D'Abo. GOD, I NEED  HELP!",951436800,14,361,4.358208955223881
