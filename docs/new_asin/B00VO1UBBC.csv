7100940,1,B00VO1UBBC,It's a very bad show. The people who make it must think all kids are stupid. I can't believe this is still on the DC time slot on Cartoon Network than again Cartoon Network hasn't been up to par lately with it another shows. The jokes are horrible and they never really fight crime.,1428796800,8,282,4.2407407407407405

7100942,1,B00VO1UBBC,"Worst possible adaptation of any DC series. Don't even buy for your children. It will teach them that books are bad, hitting people continuously is how you lead, and other things such as ruining others lives to make yours better is the best course of action.",1428796800,11,258,4.630434782608695

7100960,1,B00VO1UBBC,"Let me make this very clear right now, I adore the original Teen Titans cartoon. Heck, Young Justice was a good spiritual successor to it, and it even fit the tone of the comics much better than the original. Fans of the 2003 Teen Titans cartoon have been wanting a revival or spinoff since it ended in 2006 after 5 seasons. When I saw the DC Nation shorts of the New Teen Titans I was fairly impressed, yes it's a pure comedy show but I got a chuckle out of these one minute skits plenty.

Then in 2013 it seemed we got our wish, Teen Titans Go premiered on Cartoon Network and seemed to blow up overnight into their next biggest toy icons. Truth be told, I don't hate Teen Titans Go because it's a pure comedy show, I don't even hate it because it disgraces the original series in every conceivable way, I hate it because it's purely stupid and an insult to all animation! This is the definition of a cartoon purely made to sell toys and pander to children, thinking all they need are bright colors, loud and obnoxious characters like Cyborg and Beast Boy have become, and completely insulting the viewers intelligences of all ages. One episode even outright stated that all smart people are downers and that being stupid is a positive thing!

At first, I was just gonna ignore it, let it become the next Johnny Test playing superheroes, but this show has proven time and time again that it deeply enjoys mocking everybody who watches it. Not just the children, but the adults who watch the show unironically and those of us who have legitimate criticisms against the show, they don't seem to understand at all as to why people despise it at all! The creators once said in an interview that they've never seen any episodes of the original series, well they were either flat-out lying or they have since then because this show LOVES to destroy the original show's integrity! Once they even dubbed over the footage of Trouble in Tokyo just to make a stupid Starfire x Robin shipping joke! They dedicated a whole episode to the misconception that we want the Teen Titans to be dark and gritty like a Frank Miller comic book, when the original show was a perfect balance of action, drama and comedy.

Do yourself a huge favor: if you value the intelligence of your children, or are a fan of the original show, do not buy this Blu ray or any of the shows merchandise at all! This cartoon is one of the most degrading, insulting and downright pathetic shows ive ever seen come out of Cartoon Network since Out of Jimmy's Head back in 2006, or heck! Those live action shows it aired back in 2008 to 2011!",1440460800,5,2599,4.467368421052631
7100961,4,B00VO1UBBC,"I caught this on CN and though it would be worth buying.  It has some content for adults (which is flat out hilarious at times), but it's mostly geared towards kids (obviously).  The novelty wore off after the first three episodes.  It's still fairly entertaining, but it's taking me longer to watch than I expected.  I don't see myself watching it more than once.  However, if you buy it for children, I'm sure they'll watch it over and over.",1438646400,,443,4.556962025316456
7100962,5,B00VO1UBBC,"Both my kids are in love with Teen Titans go. I am happy that the season is in two disc's; each one watches a disc and then I switch for the next time. While it is not an education cartoon per say, it is one of the tamer ones that are out right now. They watch it so much, my daughter wants to be Raven for Halloween.",1436832000,2,317,3.746268656716418
7100963,5,B00VO1UBBC,"Silly and goofy cartoon show, but despite the fact that I actually like the previous version of TEEN TITANS (and bought the entire DVD only series), this show has grown on me, and i will keep on purchasing each season of the series.

Basically, this show is really intended for the pre-school to elementary school set. That, however, has not stopped me from enjoying the goofiness of each short episode, which helps out in the setting of the current series.

There is no real lessons to be learned here, just dumb, fun.",1436486400,2,519,4.630434782608695

As for the show, if you're reading this, you're a fan, and the high quality of this presentation only makes an already highly enjoyable show even more enjoyable. It's really well done.",1432252800,5,435,4.589743589743589
7100967,4,B00VO1UBBC,"DC Comics and Warner Archive bring Teen Titans Go! The Complete First Season home on Blu-ray for you and your kids to enjoy over and over again. The hit show never fails to get a laugh out of my family and is definitely worth every penny youll spend on it. I cant even count how many times my kids re-watch it, but its definitely at least two or three times a week.

In Teen Titans Go!, we get a look into what life is like for the super teens when their capes come off. Funny things happen to Robin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg between saving the world and being regular teens while living together without adult supervision. The teens, in their ordinary lives, deal with the everyday issues of adolescence that include such important things as having staring contests to determine who does the laundry and going on a series of quests to construct the perfect sandwich. But, of course, the heroes still fight crime in Jump City when the need arises. Whatever the situation, they're always ready for an adventure -- inside the house or out of it.

Every minute of Teen Titans Go! is filled with ridiculous comedy that makes you lower your IQ and forget your grown-up worries for a while. Is a lot of the humor just plain silly? Of course it is, but its okay to let yourself go every once in a while and join your kids sprawled out on the floor for a good laugh. Its an addictive show that would even cause the Dark Knight to giggle.

Ive ran into many comic book fans who hate Teen Titans Go! because it lampoons their favorite characters. I have only one thing to say: Lighten up and learn to have some fun. Even super heroes cant be brooding all the time.

Although Teen Titans Go! is rated G, some might find an episode or two they would rather their kids not watch. One deals with Raven and her visiting demon father, who the adolescent super heroes think is awesome. It might give children the impression that demons and evil are funny, which most religious parents won't be thrilled about. Honestly, thats the only one I can think of that might offend right off the bat.

Teen Titans Go! The Complete First Season will not only keep your kids laughing, but you as well. Its filled with witty pop culture references and parodies of the super hero genre and characters its based around. DC Comics proves they're not afraid to poke fun at themselves and viewers reap the benefits through some good laughs.",1431302400,9,2418,4.486363636363636
7100968,4,B00VO1UBBC,"The complete season 1.  Unlike the DVDs which broke up the season into multiple packages, the bluray has all 52 season one episodes.  That's about it, it's two discs with the episodes no special features, audio or other random bits.  Standard 1080p HD video and strangely just 2.0 audio.  Audio is English with subtitles no foreign languages.  If you are a completionist and don't want to deal with DRM laden digital downloads this is the best quality you are ever going to get.

I get the feeling though from the total lack of extras and late release of this that this was a bare minimum effort on DC/CN part.  Makes me suspect they won't do season 2 bluray unless this one sells really well.

If you like Teen Titans Go! and haven't bought an HD digital copy already go ahead and get this.  If you already have the DVDs I can't say there is any real point in upgrading.  The animation they used for the show really isn't degraded that much to fit on DVD and with no extras there really isn't much more for you here.",1430352000,25,1017,4.390374331550802

7100972,5,B00VO1UBBC,"When I first saw CN advertising for a new Teen Titans I was beyond excited, yet a little disappointed that it wasn't going to be the same as the old show, even though the original voice actors were returning. However, after putting my own bias aside I decided to watch a few episodes and not just stop watching after my initial reaction to the first episode I saw and I found out I really like this show! The people who criticize it barely give it a chance and their favorite argument is that it's for unintelligent people and nothing like the original. I love this show now and if you realize that it is it's own show and not the original you'll like it a lot more! It's just a fun show that celebrates a lot of humorous super hero tropes that people tend to ignore.",1429228800,17,767,4.260273972602739
