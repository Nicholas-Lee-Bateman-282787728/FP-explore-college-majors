8516278,5,B000ASDFOA,"This DVD has 3 great movies of the late and great singer and actress Libertad Lamarque. For those of us who grew up watching her films, we know that the majority of her films were TEARJERKERS!

The first ""ROSAS BLANCAS PARA MI HERMANA NEGRA"" (my personal favorite) has to do with two friends who each have a daughter. One friend is white, the other is black. I will not ruin the movie by giving you the plot except to say that it is a very touching film so get out your hankies before watching this one.

The second film is ""LA LOCA DE LOS MILAGROS"". In this film she doesn't accept the death of her daughter and makes her friends believe that her daughter is alive and well in Guadalajara. When her singing career takes her to Guadalajara, everyone wants to meet her daughter.

The third film is ""EL HIJO PRODIGO"" is about a man who is forced to pass himself as the son of a very rich singer to gain her fortune.

A great set of Libertad Lamarque at a great price!",1152748800,7,965,4.256830601092896
