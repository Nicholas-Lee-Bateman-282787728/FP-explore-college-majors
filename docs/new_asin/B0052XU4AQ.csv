8454704,1,B0052XU4AQ,"Bad, slow..boring movie all around. Cant get past the first 20 minutes....maybe you can. So far I tried watching it about 3 times and nothing",1391904000,,141,4.68
8454705,2,B0052XU4AQ,I saw this film on Netflix and it's one of those movies you watch once and that's it. Not really something I want to own because it will only collect dust in a cabinet. Not a very memorable film.,1388448000,,195,4.0256410256410255
8454706,2,B0052XU4AQ,"First off, it's ridiculous to praise Ellen Barkin's acting just because she's practically unrecognizable: that's called makeup, not acting. Maybe she should be commended for allowing herself to look so awful, but she never was much in the looks department either. The best I can say is that she doesn't ruin this movie as she has some others. Her one-note performance certainly is unusual, but unusual doesn't necessarily mean great.

Second, the problem with movies based on true stories is that if the story isn't interesting the movie usually isn't interesting either. At first I wondered why I had never heard of any of these people before, under any names, and now I know why: there's nothing interesting about them - not the screwed-up, depressed family and not the neurotic, narcissistic bozo who duped them.

Famke Janssen adds a little bit of interest just because she's a charismatic person, but that plus Barkin's mousy, greasy, depressed, anorexic chain-smoking junkie are not enough to sustain a very boring story about very boring people.",1341705600,,1052,5.1104651162790695
8454707,3,B0052XU4AQ,"An interesting movie, but not quite as good as I had expected. A very good story-line; I guess it shows how that a con-man doesn't have to try too hard, if the victim is gullible. It reminds me of years ago, when adults just didn't tell everything that they know, to kids. Mother always knows more than she tells.",1331942400,,313,4.322033898305085
8454708,5,B0052XU4AQ,"This extraordinary and gut wrenching drama is compelling from start to finish and will keep you glued to your seat until the very end. By then you will be fascinated enough to want more information about this case and the true story it is based on. It is a harrowing tale of a young boy who vanishes without a trace then returns several years later under mysterious circumstances to a family in shambles. The acting is phenomenal to the point Ellen Barkin should have been nominated for an Oscar for what I think is the performance of her career ! There were so many rare cinematic moments in this film from the dreary settings to the international locales to the interactions between the various characters. The music was also poignant amid the unsettling drama and mystery throughout.

Powerful performances, an astonishing gripping story, and an emotional rollercoaster of moments throughout make this movie a must see! I assure that I am in no way affiliated with the production of this film. Just happened to have seen the movie last night on DVD and felt srong enough about it to write this review.",1317168000,,1104,4.75
8454709,3,B0052XU4AQ,"Nicky (Marc-Andr Grondin) claims he was kidnapped, tortured, and raped. His sister comes to pick him up and outside of her, his reception is cold. His half-brother Brendan (Nick Stahl), an ex-junkie hates him. His mother (Ellen Barkin), a dowdy chain smoker with the shakes don't like or trust him. He lives with his sister (Kathy Jansen) and her husband (Brian Geraghty). The FBI has some doubts about his story. Nicky was a ""bad kid"" who was supposed to be sent away the day he disappeared. Famke Janssen plays the FBI investigator. It becomes clear Nicky (who now has a slightly French accent) is playing them.

Like a good mystery, the movie drops clues along the way, although the mystery is not about if it is Nicky, if you do something stupid say like read the title of the film, you would already know. The mystery is why the family is willing to accept him as their son.

The film plays the same ""mystery"" X-files music. The acting was good. The film could be seen as a dark comedy, perhaps too dark for most people to appreciate. The irony of the situation gets better as Nicky discovers more about himself.",1314662400,2,1117,4.58
8454710,2,B0052XU4AQ,"CHAMELEON, we are told at the beginning of this film, is based on a true story about a French lad who disguises himself as other people as a way of gaining attention and 'love' which is apparently missing in his life as a near orphan. Written by Natalie Carter and writer/director Jean-Paul Salom&eacute; it misses the opportunity to use a factual story and transpose it to the screen in such a way that we care enough about the characters to become involved in the unfolding of this charade.  Unfortunately the writing and the casting and directing work against this and the result is a surprisingly uninvolving, fairly boring tale.

Nicholas Barclay (Marc-Andr&eacute; Grondin) has been missing since age 13, for reasons unclear to the town's people in Baton Rouge. LA.  Nicholas shows up in Spain after an auto accident, is treated for PTSD and is mutely amnesic until he suddenly talks and lets the hospital people know that he is Nicholas Barclay, a missing person. He states he was kidnapped and forced into a child prostitution ring that involved rape, abuse and torture - the reasons he gives for his lack of memory. Nicholas's sister Kathy (Emilie de Ravin) spends her last money to fly to France to pick up her lost brother and return him 'home' - to his chain-smoking depressed mother Kimberly (Ellen Barkin in a surprisingly monotone, phoned-in performance), Kathy's husband Brian (Brian Geraghty) and his sociopathic brother Brendan (Nick Stahl).  Nicholas's identity is not clear to his family, except for his sister Kathy who offers compassion and fights for Nicholas' rights: the others doubt that their Nicholas is alive because of events they know to be true. The FBI in the persons of Tory Kittles and Famke Janssen investigate, doubting that Nicholas is who he says he is.  After a dysfunctional attempt to relate to most of his family, his story starts to unravel and the true story of what happened to Nicholas starts to emerge: 'Nicholas'  is  Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bourdin, who after having plundered all the centers for runaway minors and delinquents in Europe, even though he has come of age, now passes himself off as Nicholas Barclay, shaves his body hair, and attempts to a carry off another 'chameleon caper' in the US.

The cinematic aspects of the film fail to make the story involving: the colors are so washed out that it appears to be made on cheap film, the story is disjointed with such scenes as Nicholas shaving his body hair really adding little to the tale, the surprisingly dull performance by Ellen Barkin is a shock, and Marc-Andr&eacute; Grondin is simply not up to making us realize the potential of this fascinating story.  Famke Janssen and Brian Geraghty make the most of the roles they are given, but otherwise the cast is unremarkable.  Grady Harp, August 11",1313280000,4,2810,4.896842105263158
