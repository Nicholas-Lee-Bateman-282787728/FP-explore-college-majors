8446396,4,B004X7VRK8,I love this work out I bought this workout to add to my diverse DVD collection of workout video's. This work out is simple and slow. It is a great starter video for anyone who has not worked out in awhile. It is not intense just a get you to move video. If you are looking for a hard workout this is not for you. If you are getting started this is for you.,1386720000,2,356,3.824324324324324
8446397,5,B004X7VRK8,"I had bought this video few years ago and enjoyed it so much. However, a friend borrowed it and I never saw it again. Perfect for a whole body conditioning  in a  short amount  of time. Sugar and Laila are great instructors.",1370908800,,224,4.285714285714286
8446398,4,B004X7VRK8,This is a really good workout.  I like that they explain the steps.  I also like the different levels of it.,1364428800,2,108,4.095238095238095
8446399,5,B004X7VRK8,if you don't like jumping due to bad knees this one maybe for you. I enjoyed watching boxing throughout my life and now i can exercise with two of the great champs.,1363132800,3,164,4.15625
8446400,1,B004X7VRK8,"I'm glad I got this vid from the library because it would be horrible if I had spent money on it.  The cueing is horrible, and downright frustrating.  I turned this off and put P90x Cardio X back on.",1351296000,2,199,4.076923076923077
8446401,1,B004X7VRK8,Very poor instruction and poor cuing.  They may know boxing but they aren't good at leading a class.  Even the count pacing gets thrown off here and there.  If you must try check it out from the library.,1331856000,,203,4.2894736842105265
