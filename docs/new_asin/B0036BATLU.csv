8389842,5,B0036BATLU,"This is a great follow-along DVD for singers/wind instrumentalists. We can always use more air! There's a huge range of different workouts ranging in difficulty, which are split into categories such as ""Warm up Workouts"", ""Articulation Workouts"" etc. The authors are very enthusiastic which is very inspiring, and give quick instructions before each exercise before performing it so you can follow along in real time. There's also helpful little on-screen reminders such as ""Remember 'Oh' Shape'"". Each workout only takes a couple of minutes so it's easy to slot it in before practice.

Note: If you search ""The Breathing Gym"" on Youtube, they've uploaded one of their warmups so you can see what it's about.",1456704000,2,1170,5.83625730994152
