7938601,1,B00005JCCN,"I bought this DVD last week and i'm not happy to announce that the quality is terrible, it looks like it was shot on 16mm, its blurry, poor resolution and half the film is shots of guys talking. Big Wednesday is a Big Disappointment and i don't recomend buying this DVD. The PBS special on nova was much better.",1066262400,2,311,4.288135593220339
7938602,5,B00005JCCN,"The soundtrack is bad? Gee...I couldn't HEAR it because I was howling at the screen! Lucky me...was on the North Shore of Oahu on Jan 28 1998...so this couldn't be bad. I spent the entire day looking at the Bay from atop my rental car - happily boxed in on Kam Hwy. It was an epic day in my life...but I did not realize that the world would take note of it until almost a year later. I happened to hear of this film - and another called simply ""Condition Black"" put out by Public Television - and got them both. It's pretty incredible that ANY of those waves were documented - if they didn't do a ""perfect"" job translating them to the screen I didn't notice. (And I don't care?) If you have any surf in your soul I'm thinking you'll want to see this.",1046649600,,750,4.1438356164383565
7938603,4,B00005JCCN,"This video has nice shots of the largest waves ever ridden. The photography is good and clear, but if you are over 40 you may want to hit the mute button when the music kicks in. I gave it 4 stars because of the histroic importance to the surfing captured in this film.",1037232000,,269,4.09433962264151
