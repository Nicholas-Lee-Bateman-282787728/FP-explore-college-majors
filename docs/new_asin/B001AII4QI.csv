3451005,5,B001AII4QI,"This show is a great show, I just love the cast and the topics are real life situations. I was in class one day and we where talking about an issue and then the next thing I know, Criminal Minds had a show over it!! the only thing I wish is that we could see more of Derick Morgan (Shemar Moore) with his shirt off>>>>>) lol JK. I tell you if you like Law and Order, CSI, and NCIS, then you will love this show!!",1234828800,,412,3.8588235294117648
3451006,5,B001AII4QI,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TV SERIES. I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE IT ON DVD.  AND THIS 3-PAK WAS A BIG MONEY SAVER. THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL LAW & ORDER OR CSI SHOW...IT'S A STEP ABOVE. EVERY EPISODE KEEPS YOU ENTHRALLED TO THE VERY END...AND THE CAST IS A GREAT MIX OF PEOPLE & PERSONALITIES.,1230595200,2,283,3.8793103448275863
3451017,5,B001AII4QI,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows- ever. I just don't understand how Amazon prices these items. Right now it's listed for $101, in May, I bought mine for $45 (BRAND NEW, shipped by and from amazon). I just don't get it.

Anyway. Thanks for the deal.",1278806400,2,258,4.375
3451018,4,B001AII4QI,"This box set is awesome!

This show is awesome!

The only thing that would be better is if it came with a DVD of special things.

The special features on each season are awesome! and the interviews give a lot of insight to the way the show is created.

Totally worth it!!!",1276819200,,272,4.173076923076923
3451019,5,B001AII4QI,"I love this series so much and I am so glad that was abe to purchase all three season at a bargin price.

3451020,5,B001AII4QI,"My home is filled with Criminal Minds television show lovers.  We ordered the first three seasons on Amazon.  Although we had to return them because a couple of the CD's would not function in either of our DVD players, we are extremely pleased with the refund policy and the business dealings of Skymedia, the company they were purchased through.  Thank you so very much to Amazon and Skymedia for being business's of integrity.  We would happily purchase on Amazon and Skymedia in the future.

Sincerely,

F.L. Ward",1272758400,,516,4.873563218390805
3451021,5,B001AII4QI,"I watched this box set for more than three weeks (including Season 4).  My husband could not believe that I was so ""addicted"" to this series.  Of course, with a Ph. D in Sociology and Psychology, I am very interested in what profilers do in Quantico, Virginia.  This series is very realistic and the writers of the episodes should be highly commended for the plots of each one.  Most people who share my interest will agree that he or she can relate to each episode.  There is definitely evil in this world.  Not only did I enjoy the series, I learned a lot from what I watched.  Worth every penny spent!",1270166400,2,604,4.387387387387387
3451022,5,B001AII4QI,"The packaging was very neat and well organized. Estimated delivery time was exact, good communication between costumer and merchant. DVDs were in excellent condition. I plan on purchasing more DVDS through Amazon.",1269475200,,213,5.6875
3451023,5,B001AII4QI,"this series is awesome, mind blowing plots, each episode details each individual's gift, they mesh well together, it is addicting, i love the episodes with gideon, must be nice to be able to dissect and profile the unsubs and always be correct, it would  be nice if this was a reality  and we could catch each unsub that exist before they become serial killers, again this series rocks. i never get tired of reviewing all the episodes over and over again. I think that  they all need storylines that depict other aspects of their lives outside the BAU to make it more realistic, only three of the characters have had relationships and those storylines  weren't really in any great detail nor was there any feedback or complexity to make you wonder what the outcomes are or would be. i still give it a 10. a must see.",1267315200,,816,4.530612244897959
3451024,4,B001AII4QI,"My order was received very quickly. The DVD's were shrink wrapped and so far only one cd has a glitch - it loads properly however, in order to play each episode I must open and close the dvd player after the previous one ends. I am very happy with this product and plan to purchase other seasons from this seller.",1267056000,,313,4.233333333333333

3451026,5,B001AII4QI,I LOVE THIS SHOW ALONG WITH NCIS GOT THEM BOTH FROM AMAZON IT WAS EASY AND AFFORABLE .... GREAT PRICES .... LOVE AMAZON .....,1264982400,,125,4.25
3451037,4,B001AII4QI,"This show is very well done, acting is very good, and characterization is excellent.  My problem with it is that the show gets you too far into the Criminal Minds that the BAU deals with.  It is ... disturbing.  I'm hooked on the show, but can't watch more than two in a row or I come out feeling 1) glad we have people like this to deal with this human trash, and 2) disturbed that I watched it.",1264550400,,396,4.051282051282051
3451038,5,B001AII4QI,Criminal Minds is one of the best in-depth look at what profilers contribute to the law enforcement field.  The series is well-written and the cast works well together.,1264550400,,168,5.0
3451039,5,B001AII4QI,"Excellent crime drama, well written, good actors. Amazon delivered in perfect condition.
What's not to like?",1257379200,,108,5.8125
3451040,5,B001AII4QI,It's less expensive (at least as of today) to buy the three seasons individually from Amazon.  About $10 less. I know I'm not giving a useful review about the series but I'm trying to save others a few dollars. Please don't flame me because this isn't a good review.,1249257600,58,266,4.428571428571429
3451041,4,B001AII4QI,"I bought these disks not knowing the show, we are almost fininshed series one and last night I was discussing with my husband what a good job the writers did in letting us know the characters in such a short time, we are enjoying this very much.  I am unsure if the show is on australian television however, again we are enjoying it very much",1246752000,,342,4.2615384615384615
3451042,5,B001AII4QI,Wonderful show...highly enjoyable. The special features are very interesting and include interviews with some of the show's characters. LOVE this product!,1243900800,,154,6.380952380952381
3451043,5,B001AII4QI,"I've just recently started watching this show and I have to say it's a fantastic show.  There are many episodes that I haven't seen yet so I definately would like to get the season DVD sets.  However, could someone please explain to me why the Sesaon 1-3 Boxed Set costs more than the individual first 3 Season Boxed Sets combined?  The list price is more and the discounted price is more.  That makes no sense.  Why would anyone buy this item?",1241913600,9,444,4.432098765432099
3451044,5,B001AII4QI,"This perhaps is the best written, well acted, and most compelling television crime show since the advent of Kojack broke through in the late 60's and completely changed the genre of Crime Shows on the Tube.

  Other than Manny and Joe, none of these actors have ever had much exposure to the public at large, and yet each of them carry their weight with sincerity, glib humour, and a worldliness that literally makes you feel glad to know them.

  The writing on this show is some of the best I have ever seen, and the unique cinematography and special effects are not just gimics to tickle one's fancy, but rather play a crucial role in the plot of the episode.

  My only concern is the level of graphic violence the show exhibits from time to time, which ironically motivated Manny Patankin to quit after two successful seasons in his equal disdain for all the blood, torture, and guts.  I actually enjoy the ""suspense and mystery"" aspects of the plot lines, rather than the episodes that depict cutting someone up like in a slaughter house in the outskirts of the Chicago Butcher district.

  I hope the show will evolve into more of the analytical aspects of criminal profiling, and move away from this graphic stuff that is totally unneccessary for a great episode to please.

Alfred Hitchcock was the master at presenting gruesome crimes without all the paint by numbers blood and guts, and as a huge fan of his career, the writers of this great TV show could take a few lessons in restraint, and be inspired by his wisdom and creativity.

  This is, however, a FIVE STAR PLUS DVD collection and I highly recommend it for its intelligent, suspenseful, and utterly entertaining writing and acting.",1241222400,25,1703,4.699324324324325
3451045,5,B001AII4QI,I really like this three seasons pack.  This show is one of my favorite TV series and I can't wait to see what will be in the next seasons.  I like all the team and how they work.,1240617600,,179,3.6842105263157894
3451046,5,B001AII4QI,"If you like Criminal Minds you'll love this!  I've watched the show from the beginning, but there were even a few episodes on here that either I missed or don't remember watching.  All in all, a great purchase!",1235606400,2,210,4.5

8277662,1,B001AII4QI,it would be better to buy these seperatley i got them at around 20 dollars a piece there is no way 3 seasons are worth that much it should be around 60.,1330646400,,152,3.78125
8277663,1,B001AII4QI,"I bought this DVD set as a gift for my boyfriend (who is OBSESSED with Criminal Minds!). The DVD's were new and looked fine. But after about a month, many of the discs stopped playing and were skipping - only a few of them still work. At this point, they were beyond the point of being returned...I felt SO bad that they stopped working because I gave them as a gift! So disappointed...",1323043200,,386,4.301369863013699

8277665,5,B001AII4QI,"I only started watching this show a couple months ago, and I'm an addict. The stories are compelling, and it's a show I don't mind watching more than once. My only complaint on the whole thing is that there is no 'play all' feature on the DVDs, which isn't that big a deal, but sometimes I just like to put on a DVD and let it run.",1284854400,,331,3.955223880597015
8277666,5,B001AII4QI,"I bought the first three seasons of Criminal Minds as a Mother's Day gift to my mother, who just loves psychopathic killer shows for some reason. On the basis of psyco killers alone, Criminal Minds has to be the most well written show on television, with every new episode, there's a new killer with his own idiosyncrasies that is uniquely different than the one before it. The cast of Criminal Minds is largely a group of relative unknowns, minus Joe Mantegna and Shemar Moore of Soul Train these days. Still every member of the cast plays their role perfectly from the forensic analyst to the criminal pathologist. If your like my mother and a fan of psycho killers, I can recommend no show any higher.",1279670400,2,704,4.64
