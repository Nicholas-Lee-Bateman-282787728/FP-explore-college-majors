8429679,4,B004HQD3KW,"The First Dogfighters episode was the best because they used digital graphics, instead of spliced old film footage.

The Red Baron episode should have been the jewel of this series, but was the worst because they did not use digital graphics and they did not come close to explaining how he died.

The slaughter in the Somme episode still makes one angry for the stupidity of the British generals.

The Pershing episode had its merits. It gave you both views of the man. He was not a good general (let alone a great general), but an able general.  After he arrived in France you would have thought he would have assessed the situation and determined that the British & French tactics were not working -- they did the same thing for 3 years without accomplishing a damn thing, except the loss of millions of lives.  Pershing should have learned from their mistakes, and did something, anything, different.  Instead, he had his men charge the machine guns too.  He gets a plus for refusing the Medal of Honor in the Phillipines -- he was right, it should only be awarded when going above and beyond the call of duty -- not just doing your duty.  He gets a minus for not ordering his troops to stay in the trenches during the last six hours of the final day of the war.  Those few thousand men his subordinates ordered on the attack did not need to die.  He should have been stripped of his stars and medals.",1299196800,3,1405,4.474509803921569
