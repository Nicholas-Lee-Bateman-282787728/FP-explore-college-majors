5152860,2,B008D19WQ6,"The title music is missing. They did the same thing with the Andy Griffith show. They don't want to pay the license fee for it.
Other than that its ok.",1381276800,,151,4.066666666666666

8526871,3,B008D19WQ6,"This is a fair collection of shows, my favorite episode of all time is not here. The episode is The Ladybugs season 1 episode 27 B&W
This is a show about beatlemania coming to hooterville. The girls along with a local friend form a female version of The Beatles, and become a big hit in hooterville. They drive the boys crazy. They sing the song I saw her standing there (female version I saw him standing there.) The girls did appear on the ed Sullivan show aka The Lady bugs. This is a great show, I hope they colorize seasons1 & 2 in a release of the complete series. Green Acres is getting a complete series release on dvd. I hope they release a complete series box of Petticoat Junction soon. If the ladybugs were included in this set I would purchase it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.",1501113600,,809,4.294117647058823
