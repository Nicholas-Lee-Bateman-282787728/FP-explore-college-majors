Of one suspect, a police officer says, ""She is mostly a prostitute.""  But she is nooooo siren.  She looks like something the cat dragged in.  This leads to a potential truth about prostitution.  It's not always about glamour.  Sometimes, any ol' john will get with any ol' woman selling.  The victim is the 78 year-old man with whom she is living.  Still, no one ever asks, ""Why was this old man stupid enough to let a known criminal live in his house!?""  Another suspect is related to a retired cop.  That's sooo important for viewers to see: cops are often just one degree of separation away from people about to be punished by the system.

The cops stand out in this episode.  There's a poison ivy subplot here that just kills time.  I love Officer C. Morgan, but she does need to consider getting a false tooth to fill in that gap in her teeth.  Please don't imitate ol' Republican Condie Rice!  One officer says to an interviewee, ""We didn't bring you here just to say 'I gotta doodoo!'""  LOL!  I didn't know that was a widely used term, well maybe just we African Americans employ it.  By the way, there's a lot of cursing from the police here.  Perhaps this is their way to show toughness in front of suspects.  However, if they are supposed to be role models, you would think they'd clean up there potty mouths.",1310256000,,1437,4.471042471042471
