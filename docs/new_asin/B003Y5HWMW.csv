4220677,4,B003Y5HWMW,"Please note: As of thiis date, May 17, it turns out that I haven't been able to do weekly updates, primarily because this review would become unwieldy. I think you'll find that the descriptions of the episodes included here should be enough to decide whether this is worth watching. My conclusion? Yes, although I'm finding significant differences in the apparent ages and characterizations of some of the people - compared to the book.

When I started this review, only the first episode had aired and I've continued to update this review - up to a point - and plan to do a summary of the overall series eventually.

 This series is based on the first of four books in the George RR. Martin series, Game of Thrones. Other titles are A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, etc (see link below). The corruption and betrayal that will ensue between the Stark and Lannister families is obvious - although the full details are, of course, yet to be revealed. Movie adaptations of books have their pros and cons and this series - so far- is no exception. Clearly, plenty of money has been spent to create a realistic sense of the time and place. You can almost feel the chill in the air and the sense of danger is palpable from the start. It does not take long for graphic violence and sex to appear.

After seeing the first episode, I went back and reread part of the book and that episode did stay true to the events in the book that were covered so far. For those unfamiliar with the book, it could be confusing to keep track of the various families. Also, the television version is quite graphic when it comes to sexuality and violence. This is not a family friendly series but then...would anyone familiar with the books expect it to be?

The setting and political intrigues between the various noble families is clear. The tight script and editing made the sex scenes stand out while the depth of the novel and character descriptions took second place. But the first episode was still very riveting and I'm eager to see how the series progresses.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-R-R-Martin-s-A-Game-of-Thrones-4-Book-Boxed-Set-A-Game-of-Thrones-A-Clash-of-Kings-A-Storm-of-Swords-and-A-Feast-for-Crows-A-Song-of-Ice-and-Fire/dp/0345529057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones 4-Book Boxed Set: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire)</a>.

Update: As the series proceeds, as might be expected, tensions increase and loyalties are tested. Young Bran remains in a coma, with his life hanging in the balance. By the end of the latest episode (thus far), keep an eye on Bran. Again, plenty of graphic nudity combined with cruelty. And of course details from the book have either been tightened or eliminated (how on earth could a series capture the vivid descriptions of the author?) So I've downgraded my expectations somewhat.

Kudos do have to go to the producers and directors of the HBO series for allowing each character to be introduced and evolve, perhaps a major aid to those unfamiliar with the book.

But back to the series....Jon Snow, the ""bastard son"" is off to join the Night's Watch. Ned also leaves while Dany (Daenerys) is taught the sexual techniques which she hopes will please her new husband. There are hints that their relationship has the potential to grow deeper, although that is far from certain as the episode ends. Because I'm working hard not to include too many spoilers, I'll only add that some viewers may find at least one death in this episode to be distressing while another is not unexpected.

Catelyn continues to reject Jon as she remains by Bran's side. But she can't prevent Jon from showing his affection for Bran before he leaves. The teenager, Joffrey, appears to be wooing Sansa Stark successfully - until they run into Anya, fencing with the butcher's boy. Joffrey bullies and taunts the boy and things come to a distressing climax (again, trying to prevent spoilers). Meanwhile, the direwolfs are proving to be more than just pets, with far greater insight and power than imagined. There is a very touching scene involving one of them as well as a painful event with another.

At several points, the Dragon's Eggs are shown, building momentum. This time around, I watched with a friend who hadn't read the book. He was completely hooked by the end of the episode. Again, would love to hear others' take on the show so far. These are only brief recaps of each episode and I can't include every crucial plot development or this review will soon become far too long. I hope I've included enough to intrigue you.",1303084800,25,4712,4.945638432364096
4220678,5,B003Y5HWMW,"It has begun!  The much touted HBO miniseries A GAME OF THRONES arrived with Episode 1, and though the entire series cannot be judged on one episode, this initial hour has all the promise of an involving and visually stunning adaptation of the 1996 George R.R. Martin series of books of adult fantasy fiction titled 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.  The 'game' is played by seven families - Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell - and what we find in the initial episode is a taste of the intrigue to come.

In this first episode Lord Eddard Stark (Sean Bean) is the patriarch of House Stark, one of the major noble houses of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros and ancestral rulers of the North. Near the castle of Winterfell, Eddard's children discover a dead direwolf and five of its pups still alive. As the direwolf is the symbol of the Starks, Eddard allows each of his five children to keep one of the pups as pet. A sixth pup is discovered a short distance away from the others. It is a mute albino, and this one is given to Jon Snow (Kit Harington), the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark. King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) , Eddard's childhood friend, journeys to Winterfell with his family to ask Eddard to become Hand of the King, the top advisor and military commander in the realm, due to the death of the previous Hand, Lord Jon Arryn. Eddard's wife, Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), receives a letter from her sister Lysa Arryn, stating that Jon Arryn's death was a murder plotted by Queen Cersei (Lena Headey) and her powerful family, the Lannisters. Though reluctant to leave his duties and family, Eddard is convinced by his wife to accept the position in order to investigate Jon Arryn's death. Eddard's middle son Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) is engaging in climbing Winterfell castle's walls and towers accidentally sees Queen Cersei and her twin brother Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) having incestuous relations. To protect their secret affair, Jaime throws the boy out of a tower window.  Where the story goes form here will follow throughout the remaining episodes.

Though some would criticize an early report on a series merely at its inception, it seems only fitting that offering a word on encouragement to pay attention to this new series is warranted.  We can only hope that the series continues to build as it progresses.  The cast is filled with excellent actors, both seasoned and refreshingly new.

4220847,5,B003Y5HWMW,"NO SPOILERS. I normally avoid ""dubbed"" versions of a series, preferring to watch it in its native language of the people who produced it, but after watching every season in French with english subtitles (fortunately I started from S1 in French), I would not watch it in english now. The dubbed version is that good. In fact I would dare to say that it is better than the english version. France has always had a very large ""dubbing"" industry. The detective series Columbo is an example with Peter Falk. I have heard that the French actor who voices Columbo is so popular in France that he is a celebrity like Mr Falk now. Apparently he looks like him as well, but that I can't say as I have never seen him. Another favourite of mine is Hogan's Heros in French, with the Schultz ""I know nothing"" fame. The French do comedy very well, and the German's speaking in French is very funny, but I suppose only French speakers would get the humour with the accents. Hogan's Heros in French is a classic. I was fortunate to have visited France as a young child, where I saw this series and Columbo in French over there. English people speaking French and the Spanish is distinct as well, and funny, but only in a good way.

Which brings me back to ""why"" the French version of Game of Thrones (Le Trone de Fer) is so good. It is because the accents are so well done. The Southerners are voiced over by obviously Spanish speakers, speaking French with the accent that makes them instantly recognisable as foreigners. You don't get that in the english version, with predominantly US and British actors. I must confess though that it has been such a long time since I heard it in English, that I can't really recall, and it sounds strange in the original english to me now. A second reason it is so good is the quality of the voice overs and the French actors. They obviously have spent some money producing it in another language - it shows. They have some great actors doing it, with some memorable voices and performances. First Class. I will always remember and love the way they say ""Les Lanisters"" in French. Its wonderful and adds alot of character to the show.

Fortunately the French audio version comes standard with the series (at least the ones I have in Australia). Just an idea. I watch alot of foreign movies (in languages I don't know) with english subtitles, so I think for a non-French speaker, to watch it in French would not be a chore, and by the end of the series I expect you would learn alot of French. I speak French, but not perfectly, hence I watch the subtitles. They speak too fast and too complicated for me to not have the subtitles in english. I highly recommend it to any english speaker to do so. You don't know what you are missing. The French version is better than the original. Try it and see.

Ignoring the language you hear it in, how good is this series? It is a fantastic story and TV production, as good as Tolkein in my opinion. I prefer it than Tolkein because it has less magical creatures and more humans in it, it is obviously inspired by real history, ignoring the fantasy elements of course. It is a wonderful representation of medieval times and the sagas of Royal Families. After seeing it on TV I don't want to read the books. I prefer to watch it. I hope that someday they release the ""Animated History and Lore series"" seperately as a DVD collection. The little I have seen is impressive. I have almost none of it, since I got the DVD version with none of these extra features unfortunately. Its also fun to watch the child-actors grow up during the series, and everyone get older as the series continues.",1526256000,,3647,4.472972972972973

4220953,1,B003Y5HWMW,"HBO got greedy folks!  Yes overall the entire series is good, ranks up there with the best of them.  But not until the end of season 2 and beyond(most of season 2 is just as boring, so again fair warning).  But season 1 was so boring I dozed off and my mind wondered often.  I am still scratching my head as to why it's so expensive and why so many stars, most likely people are judging the entire series and not each season on their individual merits.  I would recommend either use the 7 day free trial, or start with season 2 and come back to season 1 as a prequel when it is priced more appropriately.  You won't know much what's going on either way as it gets confusing with keeping up with all the changing characters no matter the season you decide to start with.  I wouldn't have been happy paying more than $10-$15 for this season, so fair warning, at the ridiculous price of well over $30 you will likely be pissed at yourself for wasting your money as most people are.",1521158400,,978,4.254054054054054

4220989,5,B003Y5HWMW,"Game of Thrones is one of the best TV shows ever made. The show requires a great deal of patience, especially with regards to season 1 as you are introduced to a vast assortment of characters and settings. Pay close attention because a lot of things will become important as the series progresses. The people behind the show have taken the enormous world that George RR Martin created in his books and brought it to life with stunning visual effects, landscapes, costumes, etc. This is not a show for the faint of heart, though, as there is a lot of adult content in it just as there has been with every other show that HBO has produced. If you love carefully crafted stories and fantasy worlds and don't get offended easily, then watch GOT and find out why it's such a huge pop culture phenomenon.

After the many many depictions of slaughter and carnage, one wonders why each was made to be so long.  Not certain where this idea came from, but somehow, I expected Game of Thrones would have some expanded definition of the nature of power.  Basically, those with the largest armies and leaders with the largest capacity for blood lust win out.  Lots of squirting blood, gallons of the stuff.  I liked that the characters for whom you begin to favor are easily bumped off in the script, and sometimes, the ones you want to see drop dead, actually do.  When the script calls for a little magic, they don't over do it by throwing all the special effects available.  In a nut shell, it's blood, gore, lots of ice and darkness and nothing new about power as it's generally the goal of the ruthless or deluded zealots, and will probably ever be so.",1513555200,,971,4.545977011494253

From the minute I popped it into the DVD player on my laptop I was blown away! Wow, just wow. The characters are very relatable. This is definitely not just a fantasy series. It has a historical fiction aspect to it as well. I'm a history junkie so I enjoy that part. As of now I have seasons 1-3 on DVD. Next month I'm going to get season 4. I already asked my brother to get me a copy of season 5 as a Christmas gift this year. In January of 2018 I will get season 6 and season 7 in February. I'll watch them over and over until season 8 comes out. Then I will get the DVD of that. This show is addicting! I'm already hooked on it. When the show is over I plan to buy the books as well. I've even started a collection of GOT stuff. This is the best series I've seen since the Twilight films. In some ways even better! I even did a drawing of Daenerys and Jon and plan to frame it.

4221865,2,B003Y5HWMW,"It is sad that film producers think they are adding appeal or realism by adding excessive amounts of what many people consider filth. I mean, these producers go way over the top.  The story line is compelling, the choreography and acting are very well done, but the extremes they go to shock you with overly-done nudity, sex, homosexuality, graphic violence, and crude language, leave you with a bitter taste. Take this for instance... One episode opens with a man closely examining his genitalia, complaining he thinks he has worts. When I say ""closely examining"" I am not exaggerating... Full detail close-up of his penis. Then the scene changes to something else, leaving you wondering what on earth was that all about? I mean, there is absolutely no point or connection whatsoever between that scene and the story line or the rest of the episode. No relevance in the least. They just wanted to shove that in the face of the viewer, just because. Realism, you say? I think not. Just crude, senseless, over the top junk. And that is just one of many similar scenes that overload the objectionable aspects, without adding anything to the plot.

Another thing that becomes very apparent, is the producer's obsession with the occult and with portraying people of faith as nothing more than religious flakes and plain morons. Not a single mention of Christianity or the Judaeo-Christian God, which we know from history that was the religion the majority of people followed back in medieval days. These producers would have you believe that everyone back then was totally confused about religion, that they were all polytheist pagans, and that the only ones who worshiped a monotheistic God were a bunch of crazy murderous fanatics.

Entertaining and intriguing? Yes. Does the show have any redeeming value? I  think very little.
I know that for some folks those things are not a big deal, and they will disagree with my review. But for the rest of you who also find those things offensive, you will want to skip this show, or watch it through VidAngel to clean up all the garbage.",1506729600,,2078,4.845070422535211

It may be fiction but unfortunately too many people seem to believe certain elements told in story even if it's fiction that it's ""true"". Slavery is one of them. All races had slaves. And there were more white slaves in history then any other race. Otherwise it does seem like a good show. The actor who plays tyrion lannister and the girl whatever her name is who plays mother of dragons are the best characters. I'm glad they picked who they did to play tyrion. His character does eventually draw respect at least from my perspective. And the actor does a good job. I actually liked the part where he and the girl he loves had a scene where she professed her love for him and wanted nothing in return which he did a good job fighting back the tears. That part is believable for most men of any race or genetic make-up who feel love is out of their grasp. I also like the part where his squire chose to defend him instead of taking an offer to be a knight to lie about him. It could have been a tad more emotional but it was still good. Most tv shows or even movies depict women as ""shallow"" who chase after wealthy men for their wealth but ignore how men are more shallow by chasing young beautiful women. This show shows a lot of men who prefer young women to marry. They need to bring a woman character who points that out. I think it could add to the drama for a season with her character to defend women's rights in that era. Anyway the show is ok. I would give it more stars if they didn't paint one race as the only ones to have slaves when its not true.",1505174400,,1688,4.2291021671826625

Rape, incest, endless pointless pornography, shallow characters, and careless writing that is a disgrace to the fantasy genre adorn something that can truly be described as a total abasement of modern fantasy. This is in part the fault of HBO actively seeking to create shows which are designed to challenge important social taboos against such things - but one must ask to what end?

When all the taboos are gone what then? When will we admit that we have completely lost our minds? Perhaps, it is the removal or covering up of a guilt that says these things are not worthy of our attention.
