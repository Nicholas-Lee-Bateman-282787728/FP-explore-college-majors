8039344,1,B00066NA3W,"I received this product as a gift and it was one of the worst DVDs I have ever tried.  It was immediately noticeable as scratched on the back of the DVD as if someone rubbed an object on the back, and did not work--unable to view but a few minutes of it only and was extremely grainy, each DVD is only 30 minutes each.  It looks like it was a bootleg copy made in someone's garage. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this item, not worth it, you can find it on Youtube for free.",1326672000,,481,4.0

I had ordered this 3-DVD Aikido package around mid-August 2011 for my husband's birthday at the end of August since he was looking into starting Aikido training in the late fall/winter time-frame.  I thought this would be a great b-day gift idea for him.  I'd received the DVDs but noted the quality of the DVD packaging did not look too professionally done. Since his birthday was coming up very soon, I wrapped and gave it to him for his birthday.  At first, when he opened it he was excited but then noted to me that each DVD indicated about 30-minutes and hoped I didn't spend too much on these. Needless to say, I was disappointed for him as he was concerned I might have overpaid for this set given the short length of time on each DVD and concerned where I ordered it from.  He put it aside as he did not get to play/use it until late October when he began his actual Aikido training. Unfortunately, to his and my disappointment, the DVD's did not work! We tried playing it on regular DVD player and then on each of our laptops but none of the DVDs worked on any unit we had.  Needless to say, this was a complete waste of money as it had already passed the 30-days return policy time-frame.
I'm at a lost here as I put my trust in Amazon for quality of products I order through Amazon and its affiliated vendors.  I would hope to return this and get a full refund but the only option available at this time-frame under the return guidelines, is to get a partial refund, with the added cost of paying out of my own pocket for shipment back to the vendor. we're still thinking it may not seem to be worth it....
I would not recommend anyone ordering this item from this vendor as it proved disappointing for my husband, and, as well for me with not being able to give this gift he would ordinarily have enjoyed and looked forward to playing/reviewing on an ongoing basis in the future in conjunction with his Aikido training. Also, 3-DVDS with about 30-minutes each DVD is NOT worth the cost of over $70 that I'd spent.

Sincerely, a disappointed long-term Amazon customer,

8039346,5,B00066NA3W,"I really like the presentation of the maneuvers, such as in the Jo, the maneuvers are the maneuvers that are part of the 13 and 31 Jo sets
Sensie Saito has one of the best understanding of Aikido, he presents them very well
A less experienced person might miss some of the finer points that he is presenting, however they can learn on many level and advance with Saito as their skills improve",1274054400,,392,4.383561643835616
8039347,1,B00066NA3W,All footage (Except last 8 minutes) is on you tube and is better quality than on these dvd's.  It would be a great resource if it offered superior quality to what is already out there for free.,1266278400,5,193,4.216216216216216
8039348,1,B00066NA3W,"Keeping it short and to the point:
A history section at the start of the disc is interesting, and it's good to have such footage. Repeating it for each disc to add volume is a waste of time and money. Secondly, forget using any of this footage to study details, the footage is too grainy and badly lit, the translations voice over is erattic, some of it not even there, and the Japanese audio very slight.
To get an overall impression of the style and technique of Master Saito is great, but better served if all three sections were on 1 disc. Spreading this out onto three left me feeling cheated. Don't buy this.",1214784000,2,614,4.394736842105263

8039350,5,B00066NA3W,Saito Sensei's DVD set is excellent reference material for any serious Aiko practicianer.  His demonstration of techniques were superb.,1167868800,4,135,6.105263157894737
