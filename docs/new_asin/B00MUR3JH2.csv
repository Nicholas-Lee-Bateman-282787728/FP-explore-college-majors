6602171,5,B00MUR3JH2,Love this different detectives show because it also includes so much of there home life. Making it real and great cases. Does not play in USA unless you have an all region player. (for this set). we bought one from Amazon and it has saved us so much money on being able to buy cheaper from around the world.,1438905600,4,307,4.220338983050848

8674743,5,B00MUR3JH2,"I first saw Scott&Bailey on our PBS station, this is a television series from England, and I liked the rapport between the two female detectives. Janet Scott played by Lesley Sharp and Rachel Bailey played by Suranne Jones. The series started in 2011, but I saw the first series in 2014. Season 5 appears to be the last of the series.

The two detectives have found new lives so to speak. Rachel moved to Look neon in Series 4, and has now returned. With DI Gill gone, she is now Acting DI. The Team is not so sure theyvare hapoy she is back. A serial killer is on the rounds in Manchester, and with decreased resources, investigation is tight. Janet has issues with her daughter, and is embroiled in a very uncomfortable situation. Rachel has her own issues thatcsre growing larger every day.

The detectives are friends, and their personal and private lives take a big part of this series. The cases they garner are tough and take a lot of hard work and time. The male detectives treat them as equals, which is a new and wonderful experience. Rachel Bailey is intelligent but chaos seems to follow her. In her 30's, her drinking and smoking have taken their toll. Janet Scott is older, with two daughters, and she us beginning to look old. There's a lot of conversation and red wine, some teasing, and some very serious issues discussed. This is television at its best. I found myself rooting for the detectives to get their personal problems and work related issues solved. They are attractive women but not beautiful. They sometimes turn up at work not looking their best, but that is real life, isn't it?

In season 5, the cases are tougher, much of the time it is a woman as the victim.  Their private lives at this time involve men and drinking, and, as been stated Rachel Bailey is a binge drinker, often showing up at work with a hangover. But Rachel has given that up for now. The male detectives they work with are supportive, but can be found teasing with male jokes. They all work well together, and everyone will do whatever it takes. Discipline and excellent police work is the word of the day- good series, and I am sorry this is the last.

8674746,5,B00MUR3JH2,"Although shipments from across the pond may take a long time, this one arrived rather quickly and was well worth the wait. There are many great series that we used to miss out on by not having a multiple region player and I'm glad that I bought one and have expanded my choice of DVDs for a very low cost.",1484524800,,305,4.1

8674751,4,B00MUR3JH2,"well written scripts. great acting. I hate gun violence, so this show is great--it's mostly about solving the crimes. The only thing I have against it is that Scott & Bailey both are really mean to their husbands. Just thoughtless, snarky, dismissive. I really feel sorry for those men. I don't get the idea behind writing this into the otherwise great scripts!",1444780800,,361,4.838709677419355
