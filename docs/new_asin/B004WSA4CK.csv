4489073,2,B004WSA4CK,"""We crushed the 10 major martial arts schools, no one will dare oppose us now.""  Years after his family is killed Zhang (Tse) finally finds who he has been looking for, the murderer.  The only problem is that it is his brother who he must defeat in order to get to him.  Not being a huge fan of martial arts type movies I did think that this one looked good in the preview.  What I found was a very low budget movie that was not that enjoyable.  I will say that of the ones that I have seen have Jet Li and Jackie Chan in them, and the quality of action between them and the lesser known actors is huge.  The choreography is very poor, and looks just short of what a school play would be like.  The movie did have some pretty cheesy parts but the story was good.  The only problem is that the bad action takes away from the story, it may have been better if the left the fighting out actually.  Also, I don't usually comment on the technical aspects of the DVD, like camera work etc... but the dubbing (I watched the original Chinese version) was so bad that the mouths didn't match the sounds.  I can understand if they are off in the english dubbing, but not the original.  It was almost so bad that you found yourself thinking about that instead of the movie.  I don't know if it says more about the sound or the movie itself.  Overall, maybe hardcore martial arts fans will like this.  I did not.  I say C.

Would I watch again? - No I won't

4489074,1,B004WSA4CK,"The uncut version is probably better than this cut version, but not worth watching at all.  The ending was awful. The movie just ended in the middle of a fight leaving the viewers clueless. Could have ended somewhere else.",1372464000,,222,4.6923076923076925

4489076,1,B004WSA4CK,"I don't do reviews I let people decide what they like and don't like, but this movie is so bad (and I'll watch a bad movie if it entertains me)it pissed me off. I watched the whole thing when I realized Yuen Biao was in it (for all of 2 minutes.) I cant add anything that hasn't already been said. One star is still to high, I would give it a minus 5 if i could. Watch at your on peril you have been warned",1329609600,4,406,3.788235294117647
4489077,1,B004WSA4CK,"Thank God I didn't pay more than $5.00 for it!!!!  Saw the movie at WalMart for over $15.00.  The movie is not worth the money!!!  Movie is very choppy (pun intended!!), somewhat hard to follow, and cheesy.  Looks good on the cover, but that is about it!!  Save your money and buy something better made like Azumi (Part 1 & 2) or 14 Blades!!",1317686400,,341,4.265625
4489078,3,B004WSA4CK,"For me what I look for first in a kung fu movie is good power packed, well thoughtout, visually pleasing fight scenes, in the process if a reasonable story line and fine acting is included you have a first class movie. Well in this film  I felt like I got the action packed fight scenes which is ongoing but didn't produce the other attributes not a bad movie.",1312934400,,360,4.294117647058823
4489079,1,B004WSA4CK,"The movie opens with some ""defy the laws of physics"" type of fighting, which I enjoy. It seems the Emperor wants to destroy all martial art fighting schools so he can reign supreme without fear of uprisings. The movie jumps 15 years ahead as a man tries to kill the Emperor. He is eventually captured placed in confinement, gets out, almost gets killed, gets better, gets arrows in both arms and can still fight 4 ninja warriors at once. He is helped and hindered by the Emperor's daughter, who thinks she know who he is. The Emperor also has a son, who apparently was the son of one of the man he killed, but he doesn't know that. He is also the brother of the would be assassin, who does know that. Got that?

The dubbing into English at times was fine, but when they fought, the grunts almost seemed comical. The soundtrack at times was modern, but also resorts back to traditional Chinese style of music. It is a tough film to watch. I would recommend getting your ninja fix elsewhere. Don't blame me, I warned you. Let me put it this way: I will be giving my copy away for free. It should be a crime to charge for it.",1311724800,,1122,4.2924528301886795
4489080,1,B004WSA4CK,"- This movie looks exactly like a cheap TV show. Many of the sets look fake.

- Some of the fighting scenes are good. Some are bad because of poor editing and filming.

- The fighting scenes are non stop from the beginning of this film to the end. There's no time for character development. For example, the 2 brothers fought against each other in many scenes. Each time,  one of the brother had a chance to kill the other brother but he stopped it when seeing a big scar on that guy's neck. Then the director did not give the characters time to investigate the scar further. He just showed the two fighting again and again in the following scenes. And then the same guy stopped the fighting when he saw the same scar again. It's so silly that it's boring.

- In short, it's a waste of money. I'd rather watch Iron Monkey again.",1310342400,,828,4.288461538461538
4489081,1,B004WSA4CK,"This movie appears to be a collection of made-for-TV episodes with very poor editing. There appears to be some scenes missing. For instance, in one scene, the two brothers were fighting outside an old mansion at night.  The scene ended with one brother choking the other brother lying on the ground. We don't know what happened next because the next fight scene was a fight sequence on a hill top where the main character was fighting with a masked man in broad daylight.  Where is the intermediate scene between the mansion and the hilltop? At the end, the two brothers fought together against the soldiers on top of a wooden tower and the movie ended abruptly with the collapse of the tower.  The movie did not show what happened to them, or to the emperor or the bald guy or whether the brothers succeeded in avenging the murder of their family members. The ending is so abrupt that it is as if the director and producer got tired of making the movie that they just decided to give up and quit.  I felt cheated paying to watch this movie.  This bad production is typical of old Chinese B movies and it is disappointing to see such movies still being churned out in this time and age.",1310169600,11,1186,4.472222222222222
4489082,1,B004WSA4CK,"Ouch, incredibly poor chopsocky film with some pretty poor acting. Lots of hitting but that's about it. Save your eyes.",1310083200,6,119,5.0
4489083,2,B004WSA4CK,"Whew I want an Hour and 32 minutes of my life back!

By now we know that most english dubbing for martial arts movies are bad so we've come to overlook it. However, from the way the movie ended, I think the producers ran out of film financing. oh where oh where do I start with the problems of this movie.

(taking a deeeeeeep breath)

The plot. Okay brothers torn apart from a young age who later find themselves at opposing ends of an assasination plot is compelling but it took wayyyyyy too  long to get things going. The fighting was ok but even that got old quick. Now you know when the martial arts in a movie is no longer interesting it's pretty much downhill from there.

Also, the movie looks cheap in film quality. The film editor shouldve been fired for scenes that were either cut too long or too short. Note to Film editor: pacing matters. There was lots of fat to cut in this movie. I'm doing you a favor by limiting my criticism.

I'd only recommend this movie if you had a choice of this movie or watching paint dry. *dead stare*... yeah THAT bad.

On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this a 5. I'd go much lower but the spirit of bruce lee still lives on and I owed him one for the great films he made that inspired me.

Note to bruce: After this movie...WE'RE EVEN",1309910400,2,1281,4.157894736842105
8445620,2,B004WSA4CK,"Wait...What?  How Did?  When Did?  But...

That's it?!?

This sums up my feelings of the movie.

Reading online it turns out this movie is actually more of a synopsis of a 180 episode TV series.  Yeah, that's where the awkwardness of the movies lies.  I do enjoy a good martial arts film, but this one is too distractingly choppy due to how much they tried to show.  It doesn't even really end.",1491177600,,394,4.361111111111111

The movie does show the dedication and training of the shaolin fighting skill.
