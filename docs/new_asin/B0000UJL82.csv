1946652,5,B0000UJL82,"I have to defend this movie because this movie made me laugh and gave me comfort -- both totally unexpected.  Upon first impression, you might think this is an awfully depressing film.  If not the premise (the story of a town about to be flooded and an evacuation team trying to get the last of the people holding on for dear life out of there), then definitely the look of it -- the six men wandering about town in identical black suits and black cars, the camera shots of the vastness of the field, the gray-blue color scheme.
But it's not.  Pay close attention and you'll realize that this film is full of humor, unexpected wit at its best.  It's a story that makes you laugh, if you're willing to look for its essence.  The story may literally be about death and dying, but the movie is about life.  Life is hard at the surface, even dreary at times: full of pain and hardships, full of things we want but can't have, of uncertainty and wagers.  But in the end, it's what we make of it that counts.  It's our sense of humor and hope that prevails, if we choose to make our life worth it.
Personally, I can't wait to get it on DVD and savor the dialogues and the characters over and over again.",1060214400,6,1197,4.265486725663717
1946653,4,B0000UJL82,"There are old tales that Northfork, Montana used to have angels living in it.  But in 1955, we find it about to vanish from the map.  It's slated to be covered in water, becoming a lake in the process of bringing electricity to the surrounding areas.  Thus we are introduced to the setting of the movie.  But considering it's the namesake, Northfork is the most prominent character in a movie made up of characters.
The story follows three different threads leading us eventually to the end of the town.  First we find a set of parents shamefully bringing their adoptive son Irwin back to Father Harlan, adeptly played by Nick Nolte. The adorable little boy, returned on the grounds that he is a sick child and couldn't make the trek out of town, is left as the only orphan to remain under Father Harlan's care.  Second we find six men, contracted by the government to help evacuate any remaining townfolk.  Among this group of six are many recognizable faces, excellent character actors, but our focus is placed specifically on James Wood and Mark Polish, playing a father and son pair.  We follow these three pairs of men as they go from rural home to rural home and the strange antics that ensue.  The last strand of this tale revolves around the afore mentioned orphan Irwin and his encounters with 4 strange characters who claim to be angels, including Darryl Hannah and Anthony Edwards.  They are looking for a lost angel and Irwin appears to have some of the telltale characteristics.
This movie is art, beautiful with its tale and the manner it is told. It is paced slowly and intentional, the score helps immensely in the emotional movement of the story.  The cinematography is brilliant, the Montana countryside providing a breathtaking canvas for this movie.  The costuming and set work is done in subtle black and whites, creating an weird effect as if this was a colorized black and white movie.  There are definitely elements that call back to the dreamy surreality of David Lynch and the quirky Americana of the Coen's Brothers.
In the end, if you're like me, you walk out with questions.  What was real and what was imagined?  But ultimately it doesn't matter.  You hope it all was real.",1060041600,10,2203,4.712793733681462
1946654,4,B0000UJL82,"Upon walking out of the theater after watching NORTHFORK the man in front of me turned around and exclaimed, ""I think this movie falls into the category of `Huh???'"" I couldn't help agreeing with him as I was also perplexed by the events depicted in this film. NORTHFORK has a definite creepy and dark feeling reminiscent of the Polish Brothers' earlier film TWIN FALLS, IDAHO. It follows three two-men teams clad in identical black suits and black cars who are hired by the state of Montana in 1955 to make sure that all residents of the town of Northfork are evacuated before the construction of a hydropower dam which will submerged the entire town. Among one of the few residents who refuse to leave is Nick Nolte who plays a devoted priest who is taking care of very ill boy in an abandoned hospital. But this isn't any normal boy. He is an angel whose family has been in Northfork since the founding of the town by European settlers in the 18th century. In another dimension a team of three human-like individuals are searching for the unknown angel. NORTHFORK is a film that appears to be ahead of its time. It is filled with much biblical symbolism and dark humor. Regardless of my initial perplexity I am now intrigued by the work of the Polish brothers and their unconventional filmmaking.",1059609600,8,1299,4.6521739130434785
1946655,4,B0000UJL82,"More a tone poem than a narrative, ""Northfork"" will either bore or infuriate any summer blockbuster crowds who may have mistakenly wandered into the wrong theatre in the multiplex. It's their loss, as ""Northfork"" will richly reward anyone with the patience to consider it. The film's gloomy premise - a town is being evacuated before the construction of a hydroelectric damn drowns the area underwater - lends itself to the Polish brothers' somber rumination on all that is lost to progress. And as if to atone for all the real lives and homes that were submerged and forgotten under a manmade recreational lake, the film itself acts as a gravemarker for the erased existence of the titular town. Signifiers of lost, transmutable meaning are everywhere, even the jarring intrusion of odd pop culture references underlines how now-familiar catchphrases were once actual attempts at communication before they joined the shorthand lexicon of advertising and hype. If ""Northfork"" so far sounds somewhat bleak and heavy, well, it is. A dark humour intermittently permeates the magic realism, but the film's pace never moves faster than a deliberate skulk. Bittersweet, elegiacal, poetic, ""Northfork"" is that rare summer flick that aims its sights at educated adults rather than ADD-addled mallrats. Consider that both a recommendation and a warning.",1059350400,7,1344,5.314553990610329
1946656,4,B0000UJL82,"This is my first time taking a cinmatic journey with the Polish brothers. All I heard is they take more of an inspiration from the David Lynch type of film making. Where symbolism and magical realism reign supreme. (I hate using the word weird to describe movies.) So after a few summer head aches I went in for some brain food. NorthFork tells the story of a town at it's end. Several men, led by James Woods, have been hired to buy folks off the land before it is flooded and takes everything with it. Were given small hints of the town that once was, but seeing Nick Nolte give a sermon from a church with no back wall, we get the idea that this town is in its final days.
Three basic story elements are going on. The first is James Woods who really steals the show as he and his son are being offered land if they get 65 residents to evacuate. They are on their 65th house and so are the other gentlemen in the group. The second is with Nick Nolte who is taking care of a sick orphan boy. And the last is the very magical story of the orphaned boy who makes a deal with a very odd group of angels.
This group of men in black trench coats really make up a fine point in the film. They add a good comedic element as well as giving the movie a great sense of film noir and poignancy. They don't like what their doing but it's funny to see how they react to the very oddball residents in the town. Nick Nolte deserves an oscar nod for his subtle performance as a priest who cannot believe a family would abandon their child, a child he had given to them once before, so who knows how many times this poor boy had been given back to the orphanage. Theirs a grea cameo by Kyle MacLachlan as Mr. Hope so David Lynch fans should look out for him.
The most interesting aspect of the film are the angels. Not what you would normally expect but they come off more charming than the kind of angels you would normally see in movies. Its kind of a twist on the typical, Wings of Desire, type angel that we've seen a million times before. I won't ruin any plot points but they have a very meloncholy relationship with the boy and it almost breaks your heart to see the boy pleading with them to grant his only wish.
It's not a very hard film to understand, so it's more accessible for those who are wary of films that may be too symbolic than others. It has some great ""in"" jokes for those who have a pop-reference dictionary in their minds. It's a great little movie with alot to say and it's definetly worth a look.",1059350400,6,2506,4.158436213991769
1946657,1,B0000UJL82,"The story is about government workers attempting to evacuate a few last hold-outs before their town and valley are flooded by a new man-made lake made for the purpose of generating power.  Evidently it is to be about loss and change, death and rebirth.  It is steeped in religious imagery and connotations of an after-life.  This theme has potential, but it falls flat in this film.  It is extremely slow, mostly dull, and generally incomprehensible.  Some scenes were semi-interesting but they were short and few and far between.  It's a shame because with this theme and the competent acting of Nick Nolte and James Woods, the film makers could have done a lot, but here it fails miserably.

1946662,4,B0000UJL82,"I really enjoyed this flick. The whole atmosphere is dream-like and surreal. The ""men in blackesque"" agents were so darkly comical and other-worldly, i expected them to shed their skins or something. I have lived in the same home for 30yrs. I can imagine how my reality would warp into fantasy as my mind tried to assimilate the fact that my house, neighborhood and all things familiar were to just disappear forever with no possibility to re-visit them or, even to see they ever existed as they will be at the bottom of a massive reservoir.
Similar happened to me as a boy. The highway on which we'd travel to our favorite ski slope was slated to be a dam. One day my dad said, ""everything you can see will be deep under water"". I don't know which i felt more-loss or confusion. i doubt i'd do much better today.
 The film is a window into that loss.
 Along the same theme of hope and loss, a young orphan is fighting for life as his hopes and dreams are incorporated into the story line. The two plots are melded together to create a fantastical, if not sometimes confusing, story.
A thought provoking WTF experience.",1437782400,,1119,4.480392156862745

1946664,5,B0000UJL82,"A truly beautiful visual poem of a film that's all-but impossible to review because it's so many different thing's at different times, eg. is it a Twin Peaks homage ? There's the diner with the weirdo waiter/ress -  I'm still not sure if that's a man in drag or a woman - and the Kyle Maclachlan cameo. Is it an exploration of a young boy's near death encounter with angelic beings ? Is it a parody of the Old Testament book of Genesis - there's a man, an Ark and an approaching great flood. Or is it a moving account of father's and their son's - wether that be James Woods' relationship with his or the one Nick Nollte has with the dying boy entrusted into his care ?
So is Northfork all of these thing's or none of the above - you decide.
In my humble opinion, James Woods has never been better than here, completely underplaying it for once as opposed to rabidly chewing up the scenery as he's usually prone to do. The scene at the end of the movie where he speaks to his dead wife telling her how he didn't forget her is soulfully played by Woods - who manages to produce real tears - which itself is nothing short of brilliant considering that on the making of documentary the director himself was joking around with Woods by kicking cow dung at him only moments before !
Speaking of, the making of documentary itself is a worthy companion to Northfork, showing how the Polish brothers dad is quite clearly the real hero here - building all of the sets for his boys with no budget - plus the real life drama of the filmaker's never really knowing if Nolte was going to turn up for his scenes until the actual day itself; plus the priceless moment when Woods loses his cool when he's hit by icy blasts of freezing winds as he tries to make his way to the location to film.
Northfork just has it all, with a truly beautiful ending of wintery landscapes and poignant music that plays throughout the whole movie and which sadly was never released as a soundtrack.
A required taste for sure, but a highly recommended one even so.",1432771200,,2030,4.342105263157895

There are the other visitors in the town, the angels from another time but they only seen by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them...

There is some unearthly quality in the film, some dignified mourning and sublime sadness when you suddenly realize the inevitable finality of everything - humans and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness.

I cannot recall the film that affected me in the same way and as deeply as ""Northfork"" did, the film so beautiful and so tender, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. Even now, after several months since I saw it, tears come to my eyes when I only think of it.

After I saw it, I had to talk to somebody about it. I contacted a friend who had recommended the film to me  and I asked, ""Please tell me what I just saw?""

The only thing that kept me from undergoing complete emotional breakdown was the fact that some people appreciated this film in the same way that I did. This is quite possibly my favorite film ever (maybe with the exception of ""Waking Life"" which is another film that many people can't stand to pay attention to) and it really disheartens me to see people maliciously rip it apart without really going into very much detail of why it ""sucked"" so much.

I'll be honest, this is kind of a hit-or-miss film. It really takes a lot of brain power to really figure out. But because it takes so much brain power to digest it, I think that this is really the type of movie worth buying on DVD. Many great films I can watch once and enjoy them very much but I don't really care if I ever watch them agian. It's the whole idea of ""Been there, Done that, Got the T-shirt."" Northfork is the type of film that KEEPS ON DELIVERING!!! I can watch it countless times and really get something new out of it each time. Even when I think I've got it all figured out, something new hits me that I didn't see before. It's movies like this one that are really worth owning.

Also, this film is just an absolutely beautifully executed work of cinema. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Every single shot looks so carefully planned and fine tuned. The acting is great. The characters are intriguing, interesting and inviting. The film is just dripping with symbolism in every scene. The themes are deep and mature. This is the kind of movie that gets me going. It's absolutely captivating. Yes it's dense, yes it's complicated and yes it's absolutely beautiful.

When I say ""Brain Activity Required"" I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea. I'm not saying that anyone who didn't appreciate this movie is an idiotic bump on a log who's not worthy of life on this planet. Not at all. What I am saying is that this movie really requires a lot more of an active processes from the audience. This is a movie that requires a much different approach to watching a movie. It's sort of like reading Charles Dickens. The pace may be slow, and it may be hard to dig the meaning out of the presentation, but you really see the genius when you get it all set straight. If you want to be a passive audience, then by all means this movie is not for you. Don't waste your time with it and don't hurt my feelings when you rip it apart for being too slow or boring or convoluted. If you really want an intellectually stimulating film, the open up Northfork and enjoy it for all it's worth. And it is sure worth a lot.",1167350400,15,2689,4.406438631790745

The town of Northfork is drowned, but nothing ever really ends.  If we can live our lives in such a way that we learn not to fear death, then we will come to understand the fullness of life.

1946695,2,B0000UJL82,"There are many plot summaries available here.  This is an assessment of quality.

It's been a long time since I've watched a movie which demonstrated such quirky artistic genius relative to the sets, characters, and direction.  Unfortunately, the storyline is so confusing and hard to follow that it tends to sabotage itself, so unless you have time to watch it 2-3 times (...or prior to watching, read some of the in-depth plot summaries here that it explain it in full), its nearly impossible to make sense of it the first time through.

Once the viewer has an appreciation for what is happening, the rather contrived story (the distortion of reality) still tends to work because much of it arises from the mind of a child. Yet, it remains painfully slow &  monotone in its overall dream-like character, taking too much time pulling the divergent scenes together in order to tell that story.  [At times, it required a concerted effort in order to continue watching -- despite the creativity and uniqueness of the movie.]

If there were an Oscar category for ""Artsy, Fartsy Weird"", this movie would win ten awards.  But if its a Friday or Saturday evening, and you're in the mood for entertainment: comedy, romance, action, thriller/suspense, drama, educational...... Northfork is none of the those things.  However, if you're looking for a mental challenge or something odd (.. scattered pieces of the story puzzle all over the place... incongruent), want to see something uniquely rendered despite the torturingly slow pace -- so can discipline yourself to sit through it at least one time, it truly is worth the watch, if only for the creativity of the Polish (Mark & Michael) brothers.

Creativity (sets/direction/cinematography) - 5 stars

Pace/progression - 0 stars

Story (...once understood) 2 stars

1946696,5,B0000UJL82,"It's interesting to see the polarized views and reviews of this movie.  Yet I wonder how some people watch it and say nothing happened.  Sure, it has a slow and placid pace, but even that has it's purpose.  I saw that as a mirror of the pace of life up in Northfork.  The twin dramatic arcs follow little Irwin's self-discovery of his identity and destiny, and the six men in black who must finish evacuating the town.  You can plainly chart out a three-act structure and see the Polish bros. skill.

Northfork is about to be swallowed up by the reservoir that will be created when the gates of a new dam are closed.  Northfork becomes a town that even the dead must leave.  Each family is responsible for clearing out the remains of their relatives, their important belongings, and themselves before the floodwaters come.

The movie explores the issues of transition and death and human response to such trauma.  It also has a quirky underlying spirituality, embodied in Irwin's story.  Why do we live where we do?  What does place mean to us?  Why do we fear change?  What sort of barriers do we put up to avoid transition?  What about the final change, death?  Is it to be feared or welcomed in its time?

This movie will not answer those questions, but if you're watching closely, it will open up your mind to explore your own heart.

And rare is the movie that moves you to find joy in the midst of bitter loss, to cause you to smile through tears.  This is a beautiful exploration of the human heart.

If you're looking for car chases, gunfights, aliens, lasers and hot babes, you're in the wrong place.  If you are willing to put aside your preconceived notions and let yourself be carried away to a strange, bittersweet, ultimately joyful experience, then journey to Northfork.

Otherwise, the plot is vacuous and the script ludicrous, so much so that I would have given it zero stars if Amazon allowed it.  It was painful to see good actors trying to make something out of the incoherent script.

Lots of people like this movie, so I hate to dismiss it completely.  But I just couldn't get involved in it, and I get involved in movies - even TV commercials - very easily.  There was something forced and not genuine about it, as though the Polish Brothers are taking themselves too seriously.

1946701,5,B0000UJL82,"The Polish brothers are drawn to dark, surreal themes and sly, wicked humor. (Twin Falls Idaho is a must-see). According to the supplemental footage I saw, this movie was a ""wing and a prayer"" production, made for an amazing two million dollars (roughly 1% of production on the current King Kong retread). When you see actors like James Woods, Nick Nolte, and Daryl Hannah essentially donating their time, you know you've got something special on your hands.

Mark and Michael Polish have created a labor of love that is hauntingly beautiful and intriguingly surreal. Shot, almost inevitably, in stark and unforgiving black and white, the film creates an overwhelmingly powerful sense of place and mood. The plot, such as it is, has been covered sufficiently elsewhere. Suffice it to say that in a barren terrain a dam cannot be completed until a few holdouts are dislodged from the valley. But that is not the point at all.

Northfork is an absorbing meditation on the nature of loss, sacrifice, and redemption - the stark realities of being human, painted on an austere but gorgeous canvas. The angels, especially Hannah, do much to inform our understanding while Woods is exceptional, as always, this time as the face of cold practicality. The scenes in Nolte's semi-destroyed church are visually spellbinding while the presence of a full-sized ark tips us off that this is a movie where symbols are probably more important than helicopter crashes.

The cinematography is so elegant as to be painterly, making this quirky outlier eminently eligible for your permanent collection. Don't look for facile plot devices or easy answers in this film, but then, do any of the worthwhile questions have easy answers?",1136246400,5,1711,5.03886925795053
1946702,4,B0000UJL82,"First off a heads up on this one that you want to watch the credits until the end for this film, not because there is an other scene at the end, but rather a sort of spoken benediction.  This is something different to toss in at the end of a film, but then this is a film that is decidedly different.

The town of Northfork was established around the time of the Declaration of Independence in what would eventually become Montana and it is going to cease to exist in 1955 when a new dam which will provide power for the rest of the state creates the biggest lake west of the Mississippi (that does not have a ridiculously high salt content) puts it underwater.  That will make living in the town impossible, but there are a few folk who are not inclined to leave.  Therefore a trio of two-man evacuation teams and sent in to the area to persuade these people to get out while the getting is good (they will be paid in lake front property in the brand new world that will be created by the dam).  Of course, the ones that are left will be tough nuts to crack.  There are the people who start shooting shotguns at the Evacuators (you have to love that name) and the guy who has built an ark to ride out the rising waters.  Then there is Father Harlan (Nick Nolte) who is prepared to leave but cannot leave the side of Irwin (Duel Farnes), a young boy who is too sick to be moved.

There is a fork in the road for ""Northfork"" and Irwin has a counterpart in Walter O'Brien (James Woods), one of the Evacuators.  Walter is driving the dusty roads in his black sedan, doing what he can to get these people to move.  His face is as rugged and dusty as the bleak landscape of the Montana landscape before the coming deluge.  Walter is of the earth, but Irwin is of the air.  At least that is the conclusion we want to draw when we see the conversation he is having, presumably in his mind, with a quartet of angels.  Having been returned to the priest by his adoptive parents, Irwin has come to belief that he is the lost angel of local lore, who has fallen to Earth and had his wings amputated by humans.  Surely the angels have come to return him home.

The angels are the asexual Flower Hercules (Daryl Hannah), an asexual looking creature, the talkative Cup of Tea (Robin Sachs), the mute cowboy Cod (Ben Foster), and Happy (Anthony Edwards), who needs his bizarre glasses to see what cannot be seen.  This part of the story plays either way, but of course the lyrical touches the heartstrings more.  This 2003 film is my first by the Polish brothers: Mark writes and acts while Michael writes and directs.  Since the DVD extras inform me this is the third film in their trilogy, following ""Twin Falls, Idaho"" and ""Jackpot,"" I was thinking starting at this end might be a mistake.  But it is not that type of trilogy (think Baz Lurhmann rather than Peter Jackson), plus ""Northfork"" was the first of the three scripts that they wrote although the last produced, so I do not feel too bad about it.

For me how everything came together at the end did not quite add up to magic.  I did not mind the languorous pacing of the film, having decried the frantic camera movement and constant cuts, and the slow approach fits the setting and the story.  Obviously this is not an easy film and if you do not really appreciate a film making more sense the second time around (or in retrospect, once you have given it some thought), then ""Northfork"" will not be, given the above, your cup of tea.  Then again if this quirky film really works for you it could be an eccentric hit in your collection.  It certainly has enough going for it for me to want to check out the other films by the Polish brothers, even if they prove to be as challenging as this one.",1135123200,3,3740,4.317596566523605

We've all heard it 'God says I already sent a boat and a helicopter dummy' did that have to be such a drawn out scene? No but it was because they were short on dialogue. It started out on paper as something that couldve been special but winded up with everyone being happy with Noltes, Woods, Hannah and Edwards performances which were well acted out pieces of insanity. 2 stars.",1123027200,3,818,4.46
1946704,3,B0000UJL82,"There is a strange beauty and subtle intrigue to this film that could have been developed into a real movie. What emerges, though, is esotericism to the point of annoyance and quirkiness to the point of becoming soporific. No, all you so-called enlightened reviewers, who cast aspersions at the purported twenty-somethings with dull perspectives who did not enjoy this film...many of the viewers of this film are actually well versed in good movies and really gave this one a chance. Unfortunately, many of you hubris peddlers seem to carry around so much intellectual haughtiness in your brains that you always mistake strangeness and originality for genius. Yes, many of the movies we see today are stupid - but the solution doesn't immediately lie in morphine-like flighty, abstruse David Lynch rip-offs.

We really attempted to stretch our imaginations around such vague scenes as the one with the ""men in black"" ordering at the diner. When we saw the luminous alien vixen played by Hannah, we hoped that we were going to take part in something as magical as Bladerunner. We deftly ignored much of the idiotic dialogue with pointless pop culture references and talk of smelly outhouses.

There were some scenes that delighted. The libertarian bible-thumping man who had built the ark for he and his two wives was on to something and amused us. The child speaking of his extricated wings, and his longing to belong, was touching (and we ignored that the zany Nick Nolte was taking care of him). In fact, we were compelled to root for Nolte in his seemingly genuine love for the child.

But you are asking too much to deal with so many loose ends and questions unanswered.

Yes, the film is beautiful and yes, it is unique; but is it really a complete film? I perceived it as an incomplete dreamscape that annoyed more than it satisfied and induced exhaustion more than it stimulated.

The film does, however, leave an unmistakable opium-like malaise which is appealing at certain levels...almost powerful enough to forget that it annoyed you before putting you to sleep!",1120521600,4,2073,4.92836676217765
1946705,5,B0000UJL82,"We are so fortunate that any filmmakers are taking genuine visionary risks today; trying to create unique moods and impressions. This is a wonderful film, slow paced and artful, dense and oblique, and filled with wonderful surprises and screwball humor. Quite a juggling act and not an obvious one--that's a tribute to the skills of the filmmakers. I was totally delighted when I saw this, I've watched it several times, it gets better with each viewing. Parts are exceptionally moving.

You'll notice similarities in the language used in most, if not all, of the negative reviews of this film. As a whole, they make for an illuminating read, an index of the Pandora's Box we've opened by allowing pop culture to be treated seriously (""Graphic Novels"" instead of comic books, as if ""Sandman"" is the equivalent of ""Don Quixote"") and permitting kiddies to feel their strong yet ill-informed opinions about anything and everything were somehow highly valid.

""Boring"" is the most frequently used word in these short stammering tantrum-like reviews (and in others like them elsewhere--read some Guy Maddin reviews sometime, it's depressing). ""Artsy"" is the other perjorative of choice (Today the word simply means ""Over my head""). ""Boring"" is not an aesthetic judgement, it's a subjective impression and these days it's most frequently used by intellectually ""youngish"" people (unfortunately aged 14 to 50) who are equally ""bored"" by the ""artsy"" Beethoven or Shakespeare not to mention the ten million other major works of art that fail to titilate them in an ADD adaptive way. The Mona Lisa is boring, as are the Parthenon and Taj Mahal. Nowadays, one always senses a bag of weed, a bottle of beer, and an upcoming MBA hovering over that word; the fact that it may be an expensive imported beer and Ivy League frat-boy Colombian that cost more than most people's monthly food budget changes nothing. None of this would or should matter but the reason I'm making a big stink here is that marketing people, advertising geeks, the media, and politicians determine the texture of our entire culture by listening to kids of all ages weigh the universe in their boring/not boring scales. That's why our culture is almost complete candy-coated garbage nowadays, why childlike primary colors dominate in every sense, why the media is ignoring frontal lobes entirely, zeroing in on the back brain, the Reptilian part that deals solely with ""Do I eat it, kill it, or have sex with it?""

I sense this film's severest and most incoherent critics therefore are the same twenty-something ""yoots"" who burbled and drooled delightedly over immortal classics like ""Fight Club"" and ""Kill Bill."" In other words, what I'm saying is that due to bad marketing (I saw this DVD for sale at Target at the mall for Pete's sake!) Northfork accidentally fell into the hands of a lot of toddlers. Normally, we genuinely serious adult weirdos and artists try very hard to prevent that sort of dreadful thing from happening: it's like letting a ten-year-old who's been eating ice cream handle Medieval manuscripts. Confronted with a complicated object that challenged them (rather than merely amuses them or validates a corporate-approved ""bad-boy"" lifestyle), they got all cwanky, dug out their cwayons, and wrote bad tings on the walls. If the Polish brothers had sensed the way the wind was blowing and included some, say, bondage sex or sex in a dumpster, hyper-violent fights of any type, obscenely large guns, hot chicks in stileto heels and skimpy outfits and other ""freaky scenes"" the negative reviews would never have materialized; instead there'd be contented cooing. I believe one of the future ""Fangoria"" magazine contributers or mass media tycoons described this film as a ""crap-sandwich."" This isn't criticism, this is letting the family dog rate restaurants.

I write this to help any individual here make a genuinely adult decision about trying this movie. If you're mature, intelligent, and sensible, and enjoy unique and imaginative film experiences you'll probably get something out of Northfork, in fact you'll probably be wowed by it. If you think yellow Hummers, violent Japanese cartoons, and ""Sin City"" are peak moments of Western Civilization do stay away and do keep your juvenile opinions about grown-up things you'll probably never understand to yourselves. For you guys the helpfulness ""No"" button is below just to the right, unfortunately there's no ""Boring"" option. Choosing ""no"" should indicate that the review was not helpful for you in making a decision about the film unless you're a politically correct, terrible-two drone and you get all itchy if a reviewer ""flushes"" Michael Moore's holy work down a toilet (""No! No! Make bad naughty Michael Moore review go 'way!). Or you can always register displeasure by simply throwing the remains of your Hot Pocket at the monitor screen--you were planning on upgrading to a flat screen anyway, weren't you?).",1117843200,25,4951,5.116192830655129

A person might think with names like James Wood, Nick Nolte and Daryl Hannah, one might enjoy some quality entertainment. There was and is no talent to salvage this effort in my opinion.

This script is sooo slow; the music box sound track lulls you off to sleep. I never fall asleep in a movie, but this one forces you to slumber. The essence of the content is surrealistic at best. The time line on the story bounces forward and backwards frequently which is acceptable, but only adds to the discombobulated nature of an already wanting storyline. Overall, it has no depth of character, no heartfelt content to grasp onto. I was left empty both in mind and in money for buying the DVD.

That may sound a bit odd but it is obvious that the directors seek to present a certain look.  Everything is in a muted shade of earth tones and the shots are meticulous.  If you've ever been to Montana in winter you will understand.  The brightest colors are the shades of gold in the fields in winter slumber.  It's one of the most beautifully shot films I've seen in a long time.

As for the movie itself, it is a bit odd but not goofy.  The premise is the relocation of the townsfolk of Northfork, Montana in the early to mid 50s with the ushering in of a new dam to provide power.  Most of the town has left except for the few eccentric characters who remain.  The state has sent in the evacuation squad to assist the remaining residents with their exodus.  This proves to be not so easy.  The characters - those who remain and those on the evacuation committee - are quirky enough that a movie unfolds.

Everything is one notch higher than monotone with a gorgeous score that buoys it all along gently.  There are moments of comic genius that seem so due to the somber tone of the rest of the film but it never takes itself too seriously.  It touches on religous themes and the whole movie kind of has a metaphysical bent to it due to the biblical nature of the coming flood.

I'm not certain I followed it completely as there are moments where it is difficult to tell what is happening and what is a dream sequence or if in fact it is either one.  Grounded in real events, there is a bit of the transcendent that emerges.

It is slow to unfold.  It's a good film to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon in winter with a nice fire and a cup of tea.

American cinema is not strong on surrealism, but this is a worthy foray into the genre.  There is a Dali-esque beast that inhabits the landscape which is absolutely inspired.  The use of imagery and symbolism is very sophisticated, and the camera work is deft.  There were times when I found it all a bit excruciating, but my attention was always refocused by some witty vignette or gorgeous scrap of scenery.  The child who plays the angel is a heartrending presence and brings the only pathos to an otherwise ironic and detached narrative.

NORTHFORK. Just the name of this jewel of a film provokes some of the more interesting responses from those who take the time to review and share their thoughts and responses on Amazon.com's invaluable forum. That the movie ignites such polar feelings sort of says it all: this movie is one of the great ones. Mark and Michael Polish have found their own language in writing this fable: they have obviously observed in the dark theaters the works of Fellini, Resnais, Tim Burton, the Coen Brothers, Dali, Buneul, Kurosawa, et al. Their writing ideas are fresh, universal in validity, quirky in the right sense, and devastatingly beautiful. Michael Polish directs this venture and his brother Mark assumes on of the acting roles. It all works. Northfork is either an actual Montana town destined to be leveled for the 'progress' of building a dam (a lovely bit of statement about the environment and her enemies...), or it could be just the final pages of life as we all will live it - the closing chapter that explains it all, a parable. And there are many more arenas of interpretation here - part of the joy of art. Evacuating the town are the men in black (James Woods, Mark Polish, Peter Coyote, and others) and they face obstructionists to the flow of progress - a fact that the men in black happen to agree with. There is a priest (Nick Nolte in a lovely cameo) who is left in charge of a sick child Irwin (Duel Farnes) who leaves his ailing bed to consort with a band of angels in search of a lost one of their kind. Each of the 'angels' is named for the worldly belongings of Irwin: Cup of Tea (Robin Sacks), Flower Hercules (Daryl Hannah), Happy (Anthony Edwards in a role that captures the magic of the group exquisitely), and Cod (a mute but effective Ben Foster). The 'plot' includes the exhuming of all the town's past folk, measures by which a Noah character is convinced to give up his ark and two wives, the discovery of a child's angel wings - but to say more would destroy the magical tour this film holds for the new viewer. The music is oddly lovely, the camera work is from another planet, and the atmosphere this film creates remains indelibly stamped on the mind and heart of every vulnerable, open viewer.

Nevertheless if you think, you can piece together a general idea of what it's about, and a general idea is all you really need to watch something (if you're in doubt, watch Akira or spend some time as a working immigrant).  The movie feels slow, but when it's over it seems very short, and you wish it lasted longer.  It has a soundtrack of haunting music box melody, oldtime 50s tunes (we are not speaking of rock music), and one other style, used to great effect in one of the funny parts.  The overall mood is melancholy, but also often very beautiful; sometimes pensive; sometimes a sense of wonder; sometimes very funny and sometimes dry.  This movie has something for everyone, and is mixed and out there enough for everyone to think it is weird.

1946719,5,B0000UJL82,"In 1955, the town of Northfork, Montana was flooded when the gates of a completed dam were closed.  Against this backdrop, two related stories are told.  In one, three teams of men, motivated by rewards of lakefront property, attempt to get local die-hards to move on before their homes are flooded. This story is filled with humor - visual gags, offbeat characters, and a 100% off-the-wall scene at the local diner.  But there are human touches, too, as one father-and-son team argue over whether to save their wife/mother's coffin from the rising flood.
In the other story, Father Harlan (played with heart-breaking tenderness by Nick Nolte) takes care of Irwin, a young orphan who is dying.  As Irwin drifts in and out of consciousness, his fevered mind creates visions of angelic beings and reunion out of the landscape and his pitifully few belongings - a model airplane, a comic book, bird feathers he's collected.
This film is very carefully crafted.  The two, interleaved stories are visually unified by the ""big sky"" landscape and a color palette of muted blues, grays, and tans (everything - land, water, buildings, machinery, people - is color-coordinated).  The transitions between the two stories deliberately link the fantasy-like character of Irwin's angelic visions with the absurd elements in the evacuation story, and at one point suggest that Irwin's dreams may not be that far off the mark.  And finally, Nolte's monologue, inspired by his own experience, goes straight to the heart of the matter.
The result, for me, was a gentle and moving meditation on the inevitability of change and loss, and the grace we find through humor and acceptance. This is visual poetry, a movie to watch again and again.",1083628800,39,1722,5.021052631578947

1946724,4,B0000UJL82,"Northfork (Michael Polish, 2003)
Michael and Mark Polish, the same writing team behind the delightfully twisted Twin Falls, Idaho, now unveils Northfork. I'm not sure there are enough good things I can say about this movie, and yet I feel I lost a lot in translation from the big screen.
The basic structure around which all the stories revolve is the moving of the (real) town of Northfork, Montana, to higher ground in 1955. Various subplots involve three teams of related men hired to move the locals who refuse to leave their homes; the priest who runs the local orphans' home, which is left with a sole orphan to place; and four individuals impossible to describe who are searching for a relative.
The acting in this film is simply superb, which is to be expected given its high-powered cast. James Woods, Nick Nolte, Kyle McLachlan, Claire Forlani, Daryl Hannah, Peter Coyote, Michele Hicks, Ben Foster, and Anthony Edwards, among many others, all make appearances (one wonders only why the Polish brothers didn't case their favorite actor, underrated comic genius Garrett Morris, in this one). The sound transfer to the DVD is one of the worst I've ever heard, however; the voices are mixed so painfully softly compared to the ambient sound that subtitles are a necessity in some parts of the film unless you want the cops citing you for noise violations. Use the subtitles. You want to catch what's going on.
Despite the darkness of the locations and cinematography (which lends the film a claustrophobic, ominous air throughout), the main feeling of the work is a sense of pure whimsy. Angels in Montana in 1955? Well, that would seem to be the case, along with a conspiracy to hunt them down and amputate their wings. James Woods actually says the words ""Whatchoo talkin' bout, Willis?"" and pulls it off. The eviction agents find themselves in increasingly absurd situations as they travel from house to house, and the orphan, who is terminally ill, orchestrates wilder and wilder delusions in his head. (Possibly. It gets hard to tell what's real and what's going on in the boy's head.) I'd be hard-pressed to call Northfork a comedy, but it contains moments of sheer comic genius.

Unfortunately, most people's film expectations constrain them to the exclusive appreciation of three act narrative structure, single protagonists, and pyrotechnics.  If you're looking for those things, don't see Northfork.
If you don't see it, you'll miss out.  It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched.  Gorgeous cinematography, intriguingly strange story, layers of concept with integrated meaning as deep as you want to look, and sparse (and sometimes beautiful [at points even hilarious] dialogue) -- by the way, when a film uses images and mood to tell a story instead of dialogue, the filmmakers are masters.

1946726,5,B0000UJL82,"I can't ever remember seeing two sides so utterly opposed on one film here at Amazon.  Either you loved it (my case), or hated it (several others).
Having looked over both sides' reviews here, I've come to the conclusion that those who disliked `Northfork' are those who enjoy straight forward storytelling, mindless story-flow, and would prefer to watch such films as `Conan The Barbarian Versus Sheena: Warrior Princess' (you don't have to search for this film on Amazon, you knuckle-draggers out there, it doesn't exist).
Once in a while-a long while-a movie comes along that is more than a simple film; it is a form of abstract art that is left up to the viewing public to decide exactly `what' it is. Those who enjoyed this film here at Amazon (4 or 5 star reviews) seem to understand this.  Perhaps the ape-like reviewers who gave it 1 or 2 stars ought to look over these other reviewers histories and contemplate (that means `to think about', for those who don't like big words) WHY they gave it a higher review.
But let's dive into the film . . .
This is the story of a town that is dying (preparing to be submerged underwater by a dam development).  And while the town is dying, a young boy (possibly an angel who was shot down and lost his wings), too, is passing on.  He's dropped off at Father Harlan's church (played excellently by Nick Nolte) as the adopted parents flee the rising water (they claim he's too sick to make the voyage out of Northfork, but there's a reason for this if you watch carefully).
Peter Coyote, Mark Polish, and several other black-clad men in spiffy suits and perfectly buffed cars have been assigned to help the last holdouts of Northfork evacuate. . . peacefully or otherwise.  Carried by all of these well groomed men is a special suitcase with a pair of angel wings in them.  Why?  Keep watching!
As the waters from the dam continue to rise, the dying boy becomes more and more ill, having ""visions"" of angels who are searching for . . . him?  Maybe.  Is this young boy the missing angel?  Or are these creatures simply a figment of the boys imagination, a dying minds last few images (there is, after all, a Cup Of Tea, a Flower and a Hercules magazine, and other items on his bedside table that could explain where these ethereal images came from, right?)?
The filming of this story is extraordinary.  It is a sheer joy to watch.  It is uplifting (in the end), and has a message for all of us: we aren't just here to watch ourselves come into the world, but to watch ourselves leave as well.
This film's cast is unbelievable, too.  It stars Nick Nolte, Darryl Hannah, Peter Coyote, Anthony Edwards, Kyle MacLachlan, Mark Polish, James Woods, and a smattering of other highly regarded actors and actresses.  When you get a cast like this to come and be in your film, you've done something right.

1946728,5,B0000UJL82,"This film is based on the first screenplay by  brothers Michael and Mark Polish, though it is the third of their trilogy to be filmed.

Set in a small Montana town in the 1950s, this is the story of  town with a mythic past that is now doomed.  A dam will submerge the town soon so there is palpable, imagic tension as three storylines develop: first, a young adopted boy, dying, is returned to Fr. Harlan (Nick Nolte) as his parents leave town, so the priest keeps vigil over the youngster and comforts him as much as possible; secondly, six agents (including James Woods and Mark Polish) with a monetary incentive have been sent to roust out those landholders who refuse to budge, and they have a number of surrealistic experiences along the way; finally, whenever the young boy collapses he encounters four purported angels who seem to be searching for him.

It would be interesting to give this premise to a half dozen filmmakers and see the various movies they come up with; in the Polish brothers' case, we get a remarkable melange of images and themes -- angels, death, wings, bearing witness to each other, loneliness and human grief -- all set in a dream-like landscape. The cast is flawless, the pacing is slow (which makes it easier to enjoy the extraordinary visuals), and the stark situation is emphasized using a variety of techniques to film in color though almost always appearing to be black & white.

It's fascinating to listen to the brothers' commentary which tells us, among other things, that these guys were basically bankrupt when they made the film and that their father became the production designer because he was the only person who, when asked to build an ark, just said ""How big?"".

In addition to a fascinating (and essential) commentary track, extras include a series of featurettes collectively running 36 minutes and called ""BareKnuckle Filmmaking: the Construction of Northfork"", which delves into the genesis, production and filming of this remarkable film, including great comments from the actors; a trailer; and a Sundance Channel 4-1/2-minute featurette about the brothers in Montana, their homestate and the location of filming.

I'm amazed at the polarity of the reviews on this movie, and would suggest that if you are a person who likes straightforward narrative, this is probably not for you; however, if you enjoy life's amibiguities, mystery, symbolism and earlier Polish Brothers' films -- get this as quickly as you can.  It is unique and breathtaking. These talented siblings are two of the most innovative visionaries in cinema today. When others' films are long forgotten, our grandchildren will be watching these films.  These guys are totally underappreciated, and I hope they make films forever. It doesn't seem right that they have to struggle to get their works filmed, but I'm so grateful to them for all the passion and effort that they bring to their projects and with which they inspire their colleagues.",1077148800,61,2966,4.949698189134809

As far as I could see a town had to be evacuated or it would be flooded with the building of a dam (???) Nick Nolte is a preacher who shoots down an angel, thinking it was a duck. The angel is now a sick young boy that is constantly sick and cannot be adopted.
The boy dreams a lot and he keeps going to this house where four angels live. They are looking for 'the missing one'. One angel is Daryl Hannah, who is bald but wears a Three Stooges Moe wig. The other is Gilbert from 'Revenge of the Nerds', he is the studious type who knows something about everything. Oh yeah, he has wooden hands. There's this real eccentric angel who is not the most macho guy you've ever seen, and a cowboy angel who has no lines. There is also a stick-dog wandering around outside. WHat the heck is a 'stick-dog' you ask? Watch and learn my friends.
Another plot is the government agents trying to move people. The citizens are quite the characters indeed. One guy has two wives and turned his house into a boat, another nailed his feet to the porch and is a bit trigger happy, and we got two young lovers with a nice car.
Somewhere in the middle of all this is a wife and mother who is dead. The boy angel visits her grave, then she's buried in a canyon. But the first scene in the movie is a floating coffin in a river.

1946736,3,B0000UJL82,"***1/2 Like the Polish Brothers' previous films (""Twin Falls Idaho"" and ""Jackpot""), ""Northfork"" divides audiences even as it baffles and bewilders them.  Many will surely find this film to be slow moving, arty, pretentious and boring, while others will be intrigued by its originality and visionary quality.  Either way you slice it, however, ""Northfork"" is an acquired taste.
It's 1955 and Northfork, a small town on the plains of Montana, is about to be wiped off the face of the earth by a gigantic flood.  Only this time the destruction won't be the result of the angry hand of Providence but rather of a dam building project developed and conceived by the government in the name of ""progress.""  Out of this simple premise, Mark and Michael Polish have crafted an elegy to the past, a tone poem that reflects the deep sadness that comes with change, abandonment and loss.  To achieve their effect, the writers have incorporated large doses of Magic Realism (with heavy religious and Biblical overtones) into their narrative.  While we observe the harsh realities of people being driven from their homesteads, we are also introduced to a quartet of angels who are searching for one of their number who went missing a number of years earlier.  Legend has it that the town of Northfork was originally looked out for by a group of guardian angels and it is from this rather twisted and bent angle that the Polish Brothers have chosen to approach their subject.
""Northfork"" is far more about mood, imagery and tone than it is about plot and character development.  In fact, the characters themselves - the angels, a caring priest, a dying boy, and a father and son whose job it is to make sure no people are left behind when the land is inundated - are as subdued in tone as the film is as a whole.  None of the characters ever speaks above a whisper and each comes across as moody, introspective and stolid.  It is in the visuals and in the unhurried, subtle pacing of the narrative that the film achieves its power.  The dry barren plains, the weather beaten houses, the violated cemeteries, and the isolated figures of men and buildings placed in stark relief against an imposing horizon - these are the images that seep inexorably into the viewer's subconscious and which make the film a stunning study in melancholy.  Let it be noted, however, that there is also a modicum of hope and optimism in the story to help mitigate the sadness.
A number of big name stars have leant their talents to the project, including Nick Nolte, James Woods and Daryl Hannah.  Woods, with his straight-faced, deadpan delivery, provides some much needed touches of black humor throughout the otherwise deadly serious work.
""Northfork"" definitely requires that you be in a certain mood to appreciate and enjoy it.  Hopefully, you'll hit it at just the right moment.",1074902400,9,2848,4.7975460122699385

1. A dam has been built that will flood the town of Northfork;  2. Three 2-man teams dressed in black are sent out by the state to evacuate the few residents that have refused to leave the inundation area;  3.

Four angels inhabit a deserted house waiting for a lost angel to appear.
Filmed in Montana, there are some beautifully photographed images in muted tones that the viewer may find entrancing. Beyond that, however, the pervasive and heavily applied symbolism make the overall storyline virtually incoherent. Year 2001's MULHOLLAND DRIVE was positively lucid in comparison.
Filmmakers Michael and Mark Polish obviously had a vision to share. Too bad it wasn't with the viewer that's expected to pay good money to see it.  (Gee, what a concept!)",1074297600,5,1160,4.862944162436548
1946749,5,B0000UJL82,"Northfork is a very personal film. This is a very important fact to know before viewing or reviewing the film. The Polish brothers, Michael and Mark have invested a lot of their efforts, thoughts and experiences in their film, and as such like most personal films, it has a certain originality and a particular identity that might not be to everyone's tastes, but nevertheless it does not take any of its beauty.
You know it is a personal film due to the fact that it is an ode to Middle America,most specifically to Montana the home of the Polish brothers, the vastness, the big skies, the progress of the age that was creeping slowly all over America(set in the middle 50s) and the decay and death that goes hand in hand with time of incredible change.
Moreover, the difficulty that the brothers found financing their film, shows that the studios still lack the nerve and creative impulse when a script does not contain sex and digital action.
I was interested to watch Northfork mainly because of the brilliant cast, James Woods, Nick Nolte, Peter Coyote, and Daryl Hannah, without knowing what to expect, being the first Polish brother film I see.
And I was totally captivated by the whole experience, from the very first scene, with the floating coffin, up to the last with the gorgeous and forboding emptiness of the Montana plains (that have inspired many artists, most notably George Winston).
With the last days of a town about to be flooded by the construction of a new dam, and the few remaining inhabitants who refuse to leave, fantasy and reality collide effortelssly:
the evacuation teams, a cross between door to door evangelists and mob enforcers trying to persuade the last of the Northfork living to leave by reason or force, and save them and the dead people of the town in the cemetry from doom, not unlike Noah's biblical flood,
the priest (played by Nick Nolte, and giving in my opinion his best performance since Affliction) who somehow is resigned to his fate,
the group of eccentric angels who are looking for a lost and unknown angel,
and the dying sick child, who has visions of being one and has his amputated 'wings' to prove it..
these characters all move on the fringes of the great incoming catastrophe.
There are many unforgettable scenes in Northfork,
ordering food in an empty diner, persuading a religious zealot with two wives of leaving by showing him angel's wings as a sign from God,the bargaining between the little boy and the angels regarding the number of miles he wants to travel,and when he finally goes with them,he boards a plane that will take him away from the all sufferings he endured. This is all very touching and superior stuff.
But what strikes you the most in Northfork is the scenery. It is simply breathtaking! A beauty that you know is about to disappear very soon, one that you will visually as well as mentally be lost in.
Northfork admittedly, as I said above is not a film for everyone, but I think we have been given so much commercial films lately that the tastes of the new generation of moviegoers, brought up by the MTV-few seconds attention span-culture, have changed and find such personal little gems very alien, pretentious or even 'boring'(exactly like listening to commercial pop and garbage for years and when you hear Beethoven's music it will sound alien and  boring too).
Northfork is a poetic and personal film,that deals with life, decay, death, hope and rebirth,with limited choices and distant horizons and devouring yet beautiful vastness ,a creative and original film that should apprecaited and assessed as such.",1073520000,9,3598,4.812600969305331
1946750,3,B0000UJL82,"I rented this movie tonight because it seemed interesting---and it was.  However, I watched some scenes numerous times thinking that I must have missed something, but no, it's just really weird.  You know how sometimes it takes a while into a movie for everything to come together?  Well that never happens here.  The whole concept deals with death, but the scenes change so often that you can't really tell what's real or what's a dream.  What was that weird monster thing that got shot by the tranquilizer gun?  Anyway, I'd recommed watching it, just for the sake that it is different, but when you start to get a little confused, don't expect to get any answers.",1073347200,,665,4.689655172413793
1946751,1,B0000UJL82,"This is a film I wanted to like but couldn't. As it turns out, there was nothing there to like, so I don't feel so bad.
I knew I was in trouble when the preacher, in the begining of the film, misread the Bible when retelling the flood story (the ""bow"" God sets in the air is a rainbow, not a bow (rhymes with wow) as in ship.) And why do they call the preacher ""Father?"" There is nothing at all to indicate that he or his followers are Catholic (nor would they likely be in that area). And nobody builds an outhouse with a cross on it--particularly in the Bible Belt. The Christianity in this film is like a pastiche written by somebody who has no inkling of what Christianity is about. The writer must also be young-- men back then didn't wear hats indoors! I also suspect the writer is from NYC or California because 1.5 acres of property would not have been a sizeable award in that era--let alone that locale--even if it were lakefront!
This film has more loose ends than a pair of worn out socks. Why does the child have a foreign accent?  What is that strange creature (a.k.a. man on stilts)? Who are the ""angels""?  Why does one of them have a head full of safety pins?  Why does another have interchangable hands? Why is another dressed as a drag queen? What was that scene in the diner all about? Why do the men in black give out wings?
And then there is the bad Foley--the plague of movies nowadays.  Why does everything have to make a sound?  Somebody touches a feather, and you hear crinkling noises. Somebody touches skin and you hear ""shhhhhippp.""  Footsteps on open ground can be heard from 50 feet away.  Too bad the sound people didn't pay more attention to reality (that musical door chime would have sounded like crazy when the door was open and closed).
The score?  It was lovely until they brought in cheap Casio synthesizer sonorities. And enough with the digital-synth-as-music-box!
Far from ""A Masterpiece! A Visionary Epic!"" as the sell-out critic Roger Ebert squeals, Northfork is a classic exercise in pretension. Characters are cardboard, scenes go nowhere, there is no real plot, and if you look very carefully, you'll notice that most of the ""artsy"" editing is done in the first 20 minutes and then abandoned--as though they wanted you to know the movie was ""art,"" then got it over with.
This silly, puffed-up piece of trash ranks among the worst movies of recent memory.  Flood the town already!",1073347200,8,2425,4.543577981651376
1946752,1,B0000UJL82,"If you take some time to read the various reviews of this title, one point becomes strikingly clear - you either love or hate this film.  As someone who appreciates films outside of mainstream Hollywood that are shot with beautiful cinematography and engaging actors, I was surprised to find myself among the latter group of individuals that would loath a second viewing.  Be warned, Northfork is neither a documentary nor a conventional drama but rather a bizarre fantasy about death involving (among other things) a terminally ill boy and some angels.  The movie is full of symbolism and unique characters, but with the exception of the orphan who was left behind to die, I felt no emotional connection to any of it.  Even the town, which was as significant a character as any, feels hollow and lifeless.  We are given no real history of the town or any explanation of the angels which may inhabit it (unless I missed it).  Although I believe I understood part of what the directors were trying to achieve, it wasn't enough to keep me from fast-forwarding though several sections including the last twenty-thirty minutes.  Northfork is tedious.  After vesting an hour and twenty minutes I lost my commitment to finish it and I didn't see anything at 8x speed to rekindle my interest.",1073174400,4,1285,4.835616438356165
1946753,2,B0000UJL82,"My wife and I dislike the ""typical"" popcorn fluff movies that come out of Hollywood these days, preferring instead something that makes you think about your own life's experiences and such.
Having said that, you might think we would have liked NORTHFORK, unfortunately this is one of those ""artsy-fartsy"" type movies where the writers and directors go out of their way to be strange just for the sake of being strange without really ever putting anything to celluloid that draws you in or is memorable.
I must confess, we tried watching this movie 3 times and never got further than 50 minutes or so into it.... just couldn't stand it anymore.

Go sit outside late tonight and stare up at the stars pondering the origins and meaning of life... you will probably find this to be more entertaining passage of 2 hours of your life.",1073088000,3,870,4.730263157894737

1946756,5,B0000UJL82,"Northfork I saw this summer and fell in love with it.  It is one of those movies which demands multiple viewings because the writing is so rich and visuals so hypnotically dense.  I'm really interested in checking out the documentary on the DVD which chronicles the making of the movie.
`Northfork' has that something special that the Polish Brothers brought to ""Twin Falls Idaho"".  But Northfork is grander and would accurately be called an epic.  Shot in the Northwest (I think entirely in Montana) the movie is just striking to look at :  The backdrop is the transcendent mountains of Montana photographed like never before as a haunting score swells and rises with the impending flood of the soon to be deserted town, and smack dab in the middle of the mountain grandeur is a house turned giant ark, as in Noah's Ark.
  The story counterbalances the intense visuals: a town in the mid 1900's is being evacuated to make way for Government dam project.  James Woods and company are sent out to remove the holdout residents.  Meanwhile a dying orphan, recently adopted, is brought back to the town preacher(Nick Nolte) because his parents say he is too sick to make the journey.  The boy slips in and out of surreal dream sequences with a band of hilariously dry gypsies.
  Northfork really took me on a journey.  It has an American heartland feel, with a very European pace.  It is such a beautiful movie to look at and to ponder that the DVD will surely be part of any serious film library.",1067212800,17,1493,4.648854961832061
1946757,4,B0000UJL82,"What happens to us when we die? Is a final resting place really final? What defines what a home is? What is your job worth? ""Northfork"" tackles these any many other, more subtle, questions, and for the most part addresses them successfully, if not necessarily absolutely.
The movie begins with the premise that the entire town of Northfork must be moved to make way for a new dam. The dam is seen by some as a positive change, a provider of power for the area. Others look upon it as the concrete headstone of Norfolk. Most of the residents have been moved away by the government. Where have they all gone? We do not know for sure. A few have stayed, defiant to the end, or are simply too tired to make the trip. One man has built an Ark, and plans to float away once the water rolls across the land. Another, Father Harlan, is staying to help nurse Irwin, a sick little boy whose adoptive parents have returned him to the vicarage.

James Woods, in one of his best, most understated performances, is Walter O'Brien, one of the handful of government agents sent to Northfork in 1955 to help the people leave their homes. His son, Willis, accompanies him on this somber mission, unhappy with more than one thing pertaining to the town's impending doom. Walter's wife / Willis's mother is buried in the Northfork cemetery, and it's up to her loved ones to move her body lest it become awash in the waters of the dam. This brings to the forefront one of the most poignant storylines of the movie.

Irwin is not doing too well with his illness. Father Harlan (in another great performance by Nick Nolte) does what he can for the boy, including making him steaming cups of tea, giving him a Hercules comic to read, and a little toy plane to play with. And, of course, he prays for the child. But is it enough? For we see that there are visitors present inside one of the old abandoned houses on the outskirts of Northfork - four people who are there to determine if little Irwin is the one that they are looking for. As the movie proceeds, the boy's life is in the balance.
I liked ""Northfork"" quite a bit. It moves at an extremely slow pace, taking its time to set the mood, and to examine the people and occurences within the story. Sometimes we learn more about the characters by how they sit, or how they look at each other, or what they *don't* say to one another, as we would if they just inhabited a more 'normal' film. The movie is also very quirky. It reminded me, in a sense, of a David Lynch film. Unlike Mr. Lynch's incomprehensible features, however, ""Northfork"" resolves itself in such a way that you have a pretty good idea of what has transpired. Or do you?

The four visitors that Irwin communicates with in his feverish dreams are eccentric characters known as Happy, Cod, Cup of Tea, and Flower Hercules. Their names are reminiscent of some things which inhabit Irwin's real world. And there is a strange wooden horse/dog looking creature that stomps around the abandoned house of the four visitors, and it looks not unlike the head of the cane of Father Harlan. So -- are the four visitors real? Or are they figments of young Irwin's dying mind? If they're not real, then how does Walter O'Brien see them at one point?

""Northfork"" brings up this, and many more unanswerable questions. It provides solutions, but not necessarily answers. What happens to us when we die? I'm sure the answer would be of comfort to Irwin. Is our final resting place really final? I'm sure the answer would provide no comfort to the late Mrs. O'Brien. What defines what a home is? To the people of Northfork, they must find that answer elsewhere. And what is your job worth? To Walter and Willis O'Brien, as well as the other government men in Northfork, it is the possibility of prime lake front property. Is what they do for a living worth it? Is the building of the dam worth the sacrifice the town of Northfork must make?
""Northfork"" raises these issues, deals with them, but does not answer them. If you're looking for a conventional movie, then look elsewhere. If you're looking for something a little deeper, something which makes you think and feel at the same time, and which will stay with you for a long time to come, then watch this film. I guarantee you that you've never seen anything quite like it.",1062460800,11,4308,4.505115089514066

You have to enjoy the surrealism and story lines first however.  If you can't go with the laid back movement of the story, the emphasis on atmosphere and ultimately the deep sense of loss you will not enjoy this movie.

8003124,2,B0000UJL82,"First off, forget the product description.  The film is not set somewhere in the desolate Midwest but in Montana.  A town is about to be covered in water and the residents are being evacuated by a set of G-men types (think men in black suits from The Matrix) who are promised 1.5 acres of lakefront property when each team evacuates 65 current inhabitants.  Among the men in black are James Woods, Peter Coyote, Losts Jon Gries and the director, Michael Polish.  Nick Nolte plays the local parish priest, ministering to a dying young man who believes himself to be an angel.  There actually are four angels in the film: Daryl Hannah as Flower Hercules, Ben Foster as Cod, Anthony Edwards as Happy and Robin Sachs as Cup of Tea.  Yes.  Flower Hercules, Cod, Happy and Cup of Tea.

The film is shot in Panavision but the color palette is largely a continuum of grays.  Thus you get a set of dazzling images of vast expanses punctuated by forlorn houses, empty graveyards, lone outhouses, and so on that appear to be in black and white.  One expects some kind of existential meditation (Roger Ebert talked about the waters that are coming to cover us all) in a sweeping but bleak universe.  The tone, however, works against the images.  The lookalike 48 Ford black sedans driven by the evacuators seem to be part of some grave convoy, until one is shot up by a refusenik and turns into a comic rattletrap.  When the men in black go into a diner they have to guess at the single item available that day.

The overall effect: this is really different.  And really weird.  I think the problem is that Roger Ebert reviewed 260 films a year and sat through approximately 400.  That means he was continually subjected to carbon-copy commercial dreck.  He longed to see something different.  Northfork is truly different and it caught Rogers eye as a result.  When the film ended at this years Ebertfest the large Virginia Theatre audience was mostly nonplussed rather than dazzled.  I thought of it as dreamlike, but, as a result, incoherent and strange.",1460678400,,2045,4.6722689075630255
