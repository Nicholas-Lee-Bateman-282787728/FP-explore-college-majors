7991037,4,B00009KTVO,"Let me just say that I am a huge fan of Brigitte Lin (Ching-Hsia) and if this goes for you then see this great revenge drama. Ti Lung and Raymond Wong are gangster brothers - Wong has a change of heart and becomes a minister. Lung goes away into hiding for 5 years and returns older and wiser. Lin plays May, Lung's old flame who is now unhappily married to a mob boss old enough to be her father. Lung convinces her to leave her mean husband and leave with him. May is killed by a crooked cop sent by her husband and Lung goes gunning for revenge. Wong has a change of heart and helps his friend take revenge. I have to say it was difficult watching Lin play an abused wife who ends up viciously stabbed to death. She looked as beautiful as ever...the Chinese consider her the most beautiful actress that ever lived. Lin is a true actress who can really emote from just her lovely eyes. Just watch ""Deadly Melody"" and see her famous icy stare of death. Great film!",1091577600,,965,4.25
