2652637,5,B000I2KQOU,"I kept on checking for the release of the second season of this wonderful sitcom, and when i almost lost hope , it came out.
This is a very funny sitcom from the late Nell Carter ,finally gets its way to dvd . Although it lacks the extras that you might wish for , it still holds the funniest moments for the two times Emmy award winner.
I can't wait for the third season dvd release.",1182124800,6,384,4.065789473684211

2652649,3,B000I2KQOU,"I received this purchase on time and it was packaged as it should be and it was new and no schratches on disk the only complaint I have is when it was recorded it freezes on some sections and when they talk they don't match with when there lips move but I am happy with the way it was sent.

  Thank You

2652650,5,B000I2KQOU,I was wondering when and if the other 4 seasons are gonna be released? its been 3 years since season 2 was released on dvd and no season 3 yet! I used to love watching this show when i was a kid and i wanna relive those great memories. One thing i noticed that universal studios released season 1 and then visual entertainment took over and rereleased season 1 then season 2 so why stop at season 2? please release season 3 i'm dying to get it on dvd!,1271462400,,451,4.078651685393258
2652651,5,B000I2KQOU,"The second season is great, however, it does begin to get a little boring when the little kid joins Neill's family, but overall there are some funny characters",1254355200,,159,4.714285714285714
2652652,5,B000I2KQOU,I remember this show as a kid. My only disappointment is there are not more seasons available. I have season 2 but season 1 set seems a little more heartfelt and funny. I truly suggest this for anyone under 30 as well that might not remember this fantastic 80's sitcom!,1241654400,2,269,4.4

2652657,5,B000I2KQOU,"I really loved this show. They don't do television like this anymore. I don't care what anyone say, the 80's was the best decade for quality t.v. Things sorta went down hill after that. Gimme A Break is one of those shows that I loved and always will. I'm so glad they are going back into the archives and bringing back quality t.v shows like this. I plan to collect every season. Unfortunately, the late Nell Carter is no longer with us. If it weren't for her, this show wouldn't be worth seeing. I can still hear her amazing voice singing the theme song, ""Gimme a break I sure deserve it."" Boy those were the days!! Rest in peace Nell, finally you have been given a well deserved break.",1191283200,9,688,4.341085271317829
8143613,3,B000I2KQOU,"This 1982-83 Season is when this hilarious sitcom about widowed Police Chief Carl Kanisky(Dolph Sweet); his 3 daughters Katie, Julie and Samantha; and their unflappable housekeeper-turned-surrogate mother, Nell Harper (Nell Carter), is when it hit its stride, especially since this was the season when Joey Donovan(Joey Lawrence) joins the show and the Kanisky household, along with the fact that Joey Lawrence guest starred in a Christmas episode of SILVER SPOONS, which by the way was in its 1st Season on NBC at the time.

This season also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC moved it to Wednesday nights after FACTS OF LIFE and FAMILY TIES, and when NBC's motto was "" Just Watch Us Now "".
Additionally, this Sophomore season of the show takes me back to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had in 1981-1982, during Ronald Reagan's presidency.",1516838400,,880,4.866666666666666

8143618,2,B000I2KQOU,"I love the series, but the quality of the dvds/recording is terrible. the dvds freeze frequently, and as I was watching an episode a few minutes ago it just stopped and started from the beginning.

in addition, the information on AMAZON is misleading, so read the package before purchasing this set. the title is GIMME A BREAK: SEASON 2, but it's actually seasons 1 and 2 combined. while this is noted on the cover of the dvd, my focus was on what AMAZON had listed, so I bought season 1 separately. these dvds are a bit costly (compared to others I've bought), so I was not pleased with my double purchase.

long story short: I will be returning these because of the poor quality.",1438560000,,681,4.483870967741935

8143621,2,B000I2KQOU,I would really love to purchase this dvd collection but close to $100 for a used collection.  i don't understand the pricing on here.  Love the series but I think the pricing is a little bit outrageous.,1371340800,2,202,4.4324324324324325
8143622,5,B000I2KQOU,Received it in time span given and have enjoyed watching it. Brings back memories of that time period. Even my grandkids enjoyed watching it and now want me to get the other seasons as well.,1362960000,,190,4.457142857142857
