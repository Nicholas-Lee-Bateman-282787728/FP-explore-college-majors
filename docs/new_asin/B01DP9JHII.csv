7721383,4,B01DP9JHII,Very good BBC-style series. Better than most police thrillers.,1468713600,,62,6.0
7721384,4,B01DP9JHII,"Netflix has produced some good series as of late. This might not be their best but it should appeal greatly to mystery fans.

Here's the scoop. Marcella seems to have been a top notch London detective before she begged off to become a stay at home mom. She has a lot of baggage due to the death of her last child and her husband leaving her. A case she worked on, involving a serial killer, has resurfaced so she wants back in the game. Her precinct has changed and not everyone welcomes her with open arms. She needs to quell her demons, stow her baggage and get the job done.

This is a seriously involved plot with a number of candidates for the serial killer position. Said characters are introduced throughout the proceedings with little reason as to what they have to do with the overall. But, bit by bit, the whole thing does come together. Anna Friel does a good job as the dark hero but the acting overall is strong. There are some frustrating missteps. Some of Friel's actions I simply did not believe. Is she so screwed up by everything that has happened to her she'd make these gross errors and possibly even black out and not know if she killed someone? It strains credulity. I liked the way the characters were drawn and their interaction with one another. I also liked the the multi-cultural casting choices. She's caucasian and has a black husband who is a lawyer for a huge construction firm. Her boss is east Indian and his boss is black. This gave a good ring to things.

This 8 part series is generally well written, produced and directed. I liked the sound design/music score as well. Though maybe not the best of its kind it's a short putt from here to ""The Killing"" and ""The Bridge."" Fans of the genre should be pleased.",1468195200,8,1743,4.4576802507836994
7721385,4,B01DP9JHII,"Having bought a region-free BD/DVD player, I have watched many European police procedurals.  Though I liked the production and acting quality of ""Marcella,"" I was put off by the numerous red herrings. A whole fishing fleet could not have dealt with them. Perhaps it was because I had just viewed the ""Kettering Incident,"" I was perturbed by the main character's convenient fugue states and the numerous interconnections that lead nowhere. ""Marcella"" is an excellent mini-series for those who crave complex mysteries. I wish all DVDs had subtitles as good as these.",1526860800,,564,5.197802197802198

7721394,5,B01DP9JHII,For a quick review it follows a detective and discoveries of a serial killer . Through the show it twists and turns who the killer may be ... clips of the main character having thoughts of involvement to be true or not you will see... great acting by both Actors and actresses . I binge watch a few episodes at a time because if really rails you in by the end of every episode . I recommend this to those who like murder mysteries with not too much gore .,1511827200,,455,4.066666666666666
7721395,4,B01DP9JHII,"At the beginning, the lead character talks to her husband on the phone and he makes her angry. She's in a taxi at the time and instructs the driver to take her to her husband's office. Cut to her attacking his car with a tire iron. Where did she get it? Did she borrow it from the cab driver? And why was the actress so often forced to wear such messy, unattractive ponytails? Is bad hair supposed to be a symptom of mental illness? It was distracting. The opening music is awful, which seems to be a trend on British TV (see ""Wallander""). There are aspects of the plot I still don't understand.

Despite the above criticisms, I'm giving this series four stars because there's so much good about it. The cinematography in particular is striking. It's one of the most visually arresting shows I've ever seen. The acting is also excellent.",1510185600,3,837,4.506578947368421
7721396,4,B01DP9JHII,"Marcella Series 1. This British mystery, a television series from the expert hands of ITV Studios, was created and written by internationally renowned screenwriter Hans Rosenfeldt (The Bridge). Detective Sergeant Marcella Backland (Anna Friel, Pushing Daisies), after taking a career break to raise her children, following the abrupt end of her marriage, rejoins the London Metropolitan Police. She jumps right into one of her old cases when a serial murderer once known as the Grove Park Killer seemingly resurfaces. Unfortunately, as Marcella dives deeper into the case, the  changes to her personal life leave her in a fragile state; she  experiences blackouts, extreme violent  rage. Someone close to her estranged husband (Nicholas Pinnock, Fortitude) is murdered; Marcella fears she may have been involved.

 The acting is strong in this police procedural, as Friel, in the title part, manfully carries the entertainment. The strong ensemble cast  includes Laura Carmichael (Downton Abbey), Jamie Bamber (Battlestar Galactica), Maeve Dermody (And Then There Were None), Nina Sosanya (Love Actually), Ray Panthaki (Convenience), Sin&eacute;ad Cusack (Eastern Promises),  Harry Lloyd (Game of Thrones). The photography is expert.  The hustling bustling city of London, now home to eight million people as it hugs its mighty river, the Thames, which has brought it great riches over the eons, is seen ever-growing, with giant cranes on the skyline in almost every scene.  In fact, as viewed in this expertly made, tightly plotted thriller, London functions as almost another character, and a slightly threatening one.

The production might well be described, was described by The Independent (UK) as a British take on the currently popular school of Nordic noir. Its somewhat more violent than many other productions, and shows the viewer more of that violence onscreen than is usual in TV land. The plot is full of twists and turns, surprises coming right along when least expected.  I did, however, have some problems with it.  First, and perhaps biggest: whats a woman whose two children, no longer that young,  are away at boarding school doing sitting at home, supposedly raising her children?  She should have been back at work long since, though I know that, for some reason, the trope of the detective having already retired or whatever,  having to be coaxed to return to work for one last job, on a case with which he/she is familiar, is, and remains very  toopopular for my taste.  There are also many many characters being introduced frequently, viewers don't know why for a while: its confusing, to me, at least.  I also had a problem with the casting.  Two of the four most important female characters are pretty young long-haired blondes.  And of the many many male characters, most seem approximately the same age, sporting enough facial hair to satisfy any Victorian, with a notable tendency to swarthiness. Not too easy to tell one from another.

Acorn TV sent me an early copy of this entertainment in expectation of an honest unbiased review. The box set consists of two discs containing eight episodes, running approximately 378 minutes.  It has subtitles, of course, for some of us who may not be that familiar with the quick, cross-cutting Londoners dialect.  And, as you might expect, it contains plentiful coarse language, graphic violence, disturbing images, sexual situations.  Definitely not family fare. Despite my criticisms, I liked this show. A little sex and violence can spice up an entertainment far more bland than this one, which is haunting, disturbing, gripping, unsettling. It was binge watching in this house. Further, as I have said many times, I do love detective dramas headed by females, and I do like a moody noir approach to crime drama where appropriate. Recommended.",1508112000,4,3817,5.20949263502455
7721397,5,B01DP9JHII,"A cold case gets moved to active investigation when a decade-old MO resurfaces on a new murder. Perhaps its a serial killer. A former cops husband (Nicholas Pinnock) does a marriage-runner leaving DS Marcella (Anna Friel) free to return to London murder investigations. She may be a bit too close to the case when the daughter of a local business family disappears, and the cops spouse is head of legal affairs for DTG Construction. It is a complex case, with conflicting leads constantly being tossed in and out of the investigation. Id scratched off a few tenths from a perfect 5-star review rating due to the fact that not all issues get satisfactorily concluded. However, that is to be suspected, as the series already has the commissioning for a Season Two, thus a few loose threads of one case becomes fodder for a lead-in when DC Marcella returns. Intrinsic writing blends drama, suspense, and thriller genre scenes.
One murder case covered over 8 episodes, with a multitude of character driven threads, which actually have pertinence to the primary plot.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes
#1 == Marcella (March-ella) finds her marriage and family life has collapsed after a sabbatical from investigating, an attempt to be a good mom and spouse. After a decade free from murder solving, DS Marcella returns to join the Metro Police team looking for a murderer which appears to possibly be the one that got away. Shes working under DCI Porter (Nina Sosanya Last Tango in Halifax Love Actually)
#2 == Grace (Maeve Dermody Serangoon Road), CFO of DTG Construction and spars with her mother, family matriarch, (Sinead Cusack North & South) and the step-son Henry (Harry Lloyd Iron Lady). Marcella suffers from violent surges followed by periodic amnesia.

7721399,2,B01DP9JHII,"Convoluted plot which constantly introduces new, one-dimensional, random characters. Mediocre acting, and very unlikable characters, particularly the lead. No use of humor or other humanizing aspects to enhance the story line, which was blatantly constructed to ensure you'd never figure anything out.

7721400,5,B01DP9JHII,"Watched this series elsewhere. It is a first rate original story, riveting British crime thriller, and inter-family drama neatly interwoven into one complex, unpredictable, and thrilling work and directed with a totally believable real people - real life palette. There are no big names, no preconceptions of knowing previous roles (Americans will have none since most don't even know where the UK is let alone what they watch in Europe) ), no expectation of anything, and nothing to compare it to thus its exclusive beauty. And greatness is what you get. Who is the killer? Its like a roulette wheel round and round and round it goes where it stops no one knows. No sense in regurgitating the details so just watch it and if you are not riveted by the 3rd episode then there is always that American movie you can feel comfortable with.",1473033600,,836,4.772413793103448
7721401,4,B01DP9JHII,"Good ""damaged detective"" mini - series, like Luther. However, Marcella makes Luther look like a choirboy - she is 'bonkers'.
Think of Carrie Mathison off her meds.
But, as usual in a person like Marcella, she is also a brilliant detective.",1471046400,2,239,4.853658536585366
7721402,4,B01DP9JHII,"This is not a perfect police procedural but it is very good. It is hard for any mystery show out of the UK to be less than very good. It really does excel at creating them. Considering they don't even use guns, that is quite a feat. What was different with this show may be what is keeping it from a full five stars. This is Marcella's entry periodically into fugue, blackout states.

Marcella is the policewoman on the box. She goes back to work after time as a stay at home wife and mother. She is married to a lawyer at a big construction firm. At the police station is a serial killer case that has the squad on constant edge. Marcella is very good at handling these cases which is why they want her back on the force.

She is also juggling the upsetting fact that her husband has had a three year affair with a woman in his work place. She has just learned about this affair. They lost a child together although they have two other children at boarding school. The dead child may have more to do with their breakup than this new woman although that is not given enough exposition.

The above is mostly pretty good. However, periodically Marcella will go into fugue states. She goes into them when there is a threat to her (of any sort). When she comes out of them, she has ""handled"" the matter in some violent way.  I found these episodes very interesting but they needed more exposition. The way they are handled here is that they are just randomly thrown into the script with no further coverage so as to give us any insight as to what is going on with these episodes.

I found this very frustrating as these episodes were a unique feature to the series. I found them far more intriguing than her husband's adultery.  Unfortunately, we spend a lot of series time on his adultery. He is so thoroughly unlikable that less of him would have been more.

Nevertheless, it is very good and worth your time.",1470096000,5,1907,4.370056497175141

7721404,1,B01DP9JHII,"It's hard to believe this was produced by the British TV: bad writing competes with bad acting; actors seemed to be chosen for PC reasons (i.e., multi-culti appeal) rather than their acting ability; most of the male characters are played by lookalike actors who look alike due to their invariable ""lumbersexual"" appearance. Marcella herself is a psychotic amnesiac who vacillates between hysteria and beer-induced calm in between her ""episodes""; but then who wouldn't in such a sterile, inhuman megalopolis with hardly a tree or an animal? Oh, sorry, the only dog in that stone-cold jungle gets killed off a few moments later. Add an amateurishly mixed bad music soundtrack that set-off the motion alarm at our upstairs neighbors (they came down to complain because their cat was freaking out, especially during the credits (boom boom boom)) and you have a straight-to-video American crime drama.",1468713600,3,896,5.229166666666667
8756571,3,B01DP9JHII,"''Marcella'' is an eight-part series portraying the difficult life of an unbalanced and troubled, though highly efficient and dedicated, policewoman. The creator of this series is Hans Rosenfeldt who is behind the production of the legendary Swedish ''Bridge'' tv series, one of the most acclaimed products of the so-called Nordic Noir genre. The result, in this case, is that even though ''Marcella'' is shot in London and casting English-speaking actors, the show is reminiscent of the Scandinavian crime fiction books, movies, and tv series both plotwise and characterwise. The plot is tight and is unfolding fast with the main character struggling to achieve a harmonious balance between family life and her job. Sounds cliched, right? Well, maybe ''Marcella'' is not a show that has something new to offer in today's television crime series but nevertheless, the plot is captivating enough to keep you glued to your seat till the revelation of the guilty party. The short duration of each episode makes it impossible to feel bored and the revelation of the culprit, in the end, comes as a surprise. If you are a fan of Nordic Noir fiction, you will certainly enjoy this series, but if not I am not sure if it is really worth spending the time viewing it, when new tv productions in the genre globally offer better quality and innovation.",1536019200,,1342,4.995535714285714

I would compare it with ""The Mantis"" and, in some ways, ""Breaking Bad"" (although the latter is more dark satire than story).  Marcella is a brilliant detective with serious issues that make her hard to like.  The crimes are very dark and disturbing and there are some scenes that many viewer will not like, but thankfully the video does not dwell on the gruesomeness.

8756578,1,B01DP9JHII,"I wanted to like this series. The premise sounded intriguing, the cast looked promising. We were promised a filet mignon and served a rump roast. S1 was meh.  S2 was an absolute train wreck. #EpicFail

Oh, where to begin. Let's start with the biggest issue--what absolutely ruined the series for me. That would be the MC Marcella portrayed by Anna Friel. She's perhaps the most unlikable, unrealistic character I've encountered in a very long time. I could not, no matter how hard I tried, empathize with this woman and thus I couldn't have cared less what happened to her. The way she lurched around the set and mumbled her lines with that near constant sullen almost sneering expression brought to mind the love child of a Frankenstein / Zombie pairing. Her acting was atrocious and at times, downright painful to watch.  Flawed characters are interesting and complex (ala Luther) but Marcella was just plain straight up bat$hit crazy. I've known stationary objects to be more interesting and worth of my time.

On to the plot. It was convoluted and confusing at times (for both seasons but especially season 2) and as usual in television series, characters do really dumb things. Hiring Marcella--or should I say bringing her back on--was one of them. The only place the woman belongs is a mental institution. The supporting cast and cinematography and blah blah simply could not make up for an annoying and unlikable lead character combined with the cliched plot.

*SPOILER ALERT* (below)

Our lead Marcella has these ""fugue"" states where she basically blacks out. I think it happens when she's stressed but I'll admit I more or less zoned out by the time we arrived at that revelation. We're supposed to care why this happens but again, I couldn't have cared less. (Zoned out.)  Her cheating ex-husband takes advantage of this and we're supposed to hate him for it--and for cheating. I actually wanted to clap him on the back. After watching her for less than five minutes I can actually understand why he ran off to the lovely and poised character Grace. I think this woman would bring out the worst in the best of people, even Mother Teresa. Bad guys take a swing or two or three at Marcella and again, I'm cheering. And then at the end of S2, I was really hoping for a very strong gust of wind to take this character out once and for all and...no. Remember I mentioned characters doing really dumb things? Rav. He saves her. And then he gets clocked in the head and handcuffed to a toilet for his troubles.

And that brings us to the end of S2. Seriously? Psycho Marcella chops off her hair and tries to ""Joker"" her face with a pair of scissors and walks off into the night to join the homeless population. (I thought to myself: yyyeeeesssss! Finally! We're rid of her. She'll probably die of some horrible infection.) But no. Some mysterious man finds her sleeping rough and tells her that through some forensic miracle her DNA was found at the scene of a house fire and she's been pronounced dead. And it gets even better (or should I say worse): he needs a ""dead cop"" on his team who can go UC. Yeah, there's fiction and then there's going off the literary reservation. S3? Please no. Just no.",1528848000,3,3204,4.658407079646017
8756579,4,B01DP9JHII,"Marcella season one introduced us toAnba Friel who plays Marcella a tortured detective. It is at times difficult to know who the murderers are and who are the police. I have never seen someone as messed up, with such problems as Marcella. The closing episode does not leave us much room for hope or redemption.

Season 2 of Marcella is the most depressing and dark series I have seen. Marcella is trying to get to the bottom of her dark days where she lashes out and hurts. Her husband has left her, she shares custody of the children with her ex husband, and that is not going well. Work is all Marcella has, and the investigation she is involved with is more depressing than her life. Children are abducted and killed. How much more can we take, well I will tell you, this series is more than I can take. I had to fast forward through some scenes, and the closing is not good, not at all. Not sure if I can take a third season.
