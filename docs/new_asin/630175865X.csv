349179,2,630175865X,"1986 saw the release of this dark kid fantasy movie which has since fallen into the dustbin of history, starring Noah Hathaway (most famous for his starring role in another kid fantasy movie, The NeverEnding Story) and June Lockhart (the mom from the Lost In Space TV show).  A family moves into a new apartment building and meets the rather eccentric cast of characters that also live there.  While unpacking, the little sister Wendy is attacked and taken hostage in the fairy world by a Troll.  Assuming her body, Wendy begins to show some unusual new behaviors which her family dismisses as the stress due to their move.  The brother, named, no really, Harry Potter (Jr), is the only one who realizes something is very wrong with her, and seeks solace with an older woman who also lives in the building, Eunice St. Clair.  When he tells her of the strange things that have been going on, she reveals her true profession, that of a witch.  He wants her to teach him magic, but she tells him there isn't time.  Instead she tells him of a strange tale back when the humans and the fairies were at war, and she and a wizard, Torok, were in love.  The humans won, and Eunice has been protecting the gateway to the fairy world, knowing that Torok would someday attempt to break the fairies free once again and she thinks that time is coming now.  When every apartment is transformed into a fairy world, the fairy world will burst forth once again.  She tells Harry that Torok can be stopped by plunging a magic staff into the heart of the fairy world, which is a large and vicious, magical creature.  Harry then triumphs, rescues his sister Wendy, and the family moves out of the apartment as Eunice is restored to her former, younger self, and the movie is left with an ending implying that Torok has not been defeated.

This movie seems kind of silly today.  There was a period in the early 80s when children's movies were leaning towards a darker storyline with the thinking that children like to be scared and it will teach them valuable lessons about adult life.  This experiment, however, did not sit well with movie goers, particularly parents, and most went back to the more familiar, sunny Disney formula we still see today.  Having not seen this movie in many years, I have a few laughs thinking the special effects look so cheesy but they were cutting edge at the time.  And how were we to know that the name Harry Potter was going to rise up and ring through the ages as one of the premiere fantasy hero characters of all time?  We didn't of course.  The story, however, is on the weak side and doesn't quite get kid or adult audiences excited enough to go into the darkened caves, sleigh the dragon, and emerge victorious.  I still wonder why Harry didn't tell his parents that Wendy was a troll once he saw her turn into him in the bed next to him.  You'd think they would be somewhat interested.

A movie for a little lite entertainment and good fun, but not very deep.  As far as fantasy movies, the special effects were also spot on yet just cute enough not to be scary.",1458604800,,3084,4.489247311827957
349180,5,630175865X,"There is no way you can really give this a five star review, unless you are like me and just enjoyed watching this movie with all it's inherent strange goofy-ness. It falls just short of being so bad that it's a classic and never reaches the line of it's a fine movie worth watching. It's one of those cheesy movies that everyone will fall prey to at some point.

What makes this great fun and five stars is the all star cast that seems to ham it up.

Essentially Harry Potter must save the apartment and the people in it in order to save the world. And NO one, but no one can do except for one lone boy working alone with the advice of a witch living upstairs. As various tenants are turned into trolls and the various apartments turned into different parts of a fairy/troll land you will get to laugh. The lands are crazy.

Even if you start to watch it and want to throw in the towel- be sure to stay for the monster chorus. That makes this movie a five star movie in my book.

It's lots of fun. We enjoyed watching it once.

With his Magical ring, he takes the form of a little girl named Wendy Potter, who just came to live there with her family,  and was placed into suspended animation. He thereby goes about causing mischief among the residents of the rooms:

There's swinging playboy with the likely name of ""Peter Dickinson"" {played by Sonny Bono}, a fanatical Vet, diminuative Professor Malcolm Mallory {who gets a second chance at life, thanks to Torok}, a college student couple, and of course, Harry Potter Jr. and Sr. {much before J.K. Rowling's series, perhaps whence she lifted the name}. One by one,  they are each engulfed into a pod which transforms them into various trolls.

Eunice St. Clair the Witch {Ann & June Lockheart} regails young Harry Potter with her troll tales, accompanied by a phallic mushroom creature she keeps in a planter, disguised as a lamp. By far the most elegant and secretive of the group, she grows young, and it is up to her to counter Torok's efforts, but is instead turned into a talking tree stump.

Particularly enjoyable scenes include the singing chorus of trolls likened Ghoulies, a seductive frolicking nymph, the transformations, Torok's  smile of diabolical satisfaction, and the final confrontation with an impressive demonic troll giant. With amusing effects, Troll remains a fun excursion into an enchanted mythological realm.",1199232000,,1524,5.076

On the day of their move Wendy Ann Potter stumbles into the laundry room where she meets a troll who kidnaps her and uses his magic ring to make himself look like Wendy. One by one, the troll enters each apartment in the complex and turns the occupants into trolls and their dwellings into doorways to a fantasy dimension. If he succeeds in changing all the homes in the building, a dimensional vortex will be formed and modern America will be changed into a fantasy realm of old. The only person who can stop him is Wendy's brother, Harry Potter, Jr. who is under the tutelage of a witch upstairs.
Granted the special effects in this movie aren't all that good. However, the script is decent and the acting is fairly well done. The cast includes Sonny Bono and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss to name a few. This movie is basically a children's scary movie; it's the type of movie I would have loved watching when I was a kid and since I'm still a kid at heart I was enable to enjoy it despite it's flaws.
As a side note, the hero of this film is named Harry Potter. He gets involved in witchcraft and fantasy, though he thinks he's just a normal kid. The apartment slowly becomes a portal that leads to a mysterious and magical world. When he saves his kid sister and fights the big monster, it reminded me off another Harry Potter fighting another monster in CHAMBER OF SECRETS. Not only that, but Harry Potter Jr.'s dad is an author of children's books.  Coincidence? Perhaps. However, as good as the Harry Potter series is, one must admit J.K.

It is a so-so fantasy story about a boy, named Harry Potter Jr., no less (played by Noah Hathaway) who discovers his sister is possessed by an evil troll (hence the movie's name).
June Lockhart shows up as a good witch who swears a lot, Sonny Bono plays a victim who is turned into an elf.

349575,5,630175865X,"I first saw this movie on a late night Noah Hathaway double feature about 13 yeares ago, when I lived in LA.  The host described this movie as a star vehicle for the young star of Neverending Story (which was shown previously that night).

The story is mostly a rehash of the plots of many '50s sci-fi movies, except you insert ""Troll"" into the script where ""Martian"" should be.  Even to the extent that Noah remarks to his kindly neighbor lady (June Lockhart) that he thinks his sister is a ""pod person"".  Of course, she (Lockhart) being the powerful good sorceress, explains that Harry's sister is in the Troll's power.

Young Harry must save the world from the evil Troll, while the grown-up neighbors (Sonny Bono, Gary Sandy (WKRP), Julia-Louise Dreyfus (Seinfeld), Brad Hall (SNL), etc.) bumble their way into victimhood.  Of course Harry's parents (Shelly Hack & Michael Moriarty) think he's just imagining things.  What makes this movie fun is that it's so predictable and the all-star cast seems to intentionally ham it up.  Think of it as ""North"" with monsters.

What I have found weirdly ironic is that Noah's character's name is Harry Potter, Jr. (Hmmmm, haven't we heard that name somewhere recently?)",971827200,14,1213,4.878048780487805
349576,4,630175865X,"Troll is one of producer Charles Band's better films. Written by Ed Naha ( Dolls, Honey I shrunk the Kids ) and stars Michael Moriarty in a likeable  performance. Theres plenty of magical and entertaining moments. One is the  part where the trolls sing. The Trolls and the Ghoulies should make a movie  together because they look like they come from the same place, or planet. A  ghoulie even makes a guest apperance. Richard Band's score is a lot better  than the ones he did before and in 1986 this was his best to date. The  Trolls were voiced by Frank Welker ( voice of Slimer from Ghostbusters, and  voice of the gremlins ). Slimer's voice can even be heard in the backround  in quite a few scenes. This is the best film of its kind, so go out and  rent it, or buy it, tonight. It's very entertaining.",966902400,5,806,4.355704697986577
349577,4,630175865X,it was a great movie but the whole thing where torok turns people into seedlings to become trolls is pretty much like what they do in Gremlins 2.  If you want to see a good horror movie i suggest something like Creepshow,966470400,,220,4.238095238095238
349578,1,630175865X,"The only reason I watched this movie was because it featured Shelley Hack in the cast. I have always thought she was cheated of getting the roles she  deserved after her departure from ""Charlie's Angels,"" but this is  the BOTTOM OF THE BARREL. I would rather watch a test pattern than this  waste of time and film. By saying this, I do not mean to insult filmmakers  nor fans of the horror genre, but even for horror films---this is not even  ""so bad it's fun."" It just reaks...... I wish Hollywood would  recognize Shelley Hack's merits and give her the roles she deserves.  Anyway, where is Tiffany Welles when you need her?  Where is our  ""TIFFANY 2000"" movie?  Tiffany would have stopped that mean ole  troll with one shot! Although, seeing Sonny Bono sprout into a tree is  just...well, I don't know what to say on that one.....",965952000,,833,4.554054054054054
349579,5,630175865X,"I first saw this when I was about eleven years old and I loved it.  So when I saw it (10 years later) for sale on Amazon I had to buy it.  Not sure whether i'd still find it as entertaining and creepy, I sat down to  watch it, somewhat aprehensively. Anxious that my fond, nostalgic memories  of it would be lost if it wasn't as good.  I needn't have worried, within  minutes I was glued to the screen, back in the world of the Trolls where I  had been a decade before.  It's a classic fantasy, with an inkling of  horror.  It has fantastic characters and makeup, with an inventive and  magical story. If you like films such as Labyrinth, Dark Crystal, Legend or  willow with a little bit of Critters thrown in, then you will love this.  It will especially appeal to younger teenagers, but I think most ages who  appreciate the genre will enjoy it.",955152000,,848,4.284810126582278

349581,2,630175865X,"Slow and pretty boring tale of a little kid who is possessed by a nasty troll and starts rampaging through his apartment building turning people into plants and making the atmosphere a little greener. A cross between  GREMLINS and LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS which is just too boring to be scary  and unintentionally funny at times.
