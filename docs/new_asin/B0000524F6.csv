Truly captivating is the trip of Mr. Stern to China and his involvement there with the musicians and the people.  He truly is a delightful man and his abilities to express and transmit his passion for music is captivating.
There are too many poignant scenes to recall, but the additional offerings here on this special DVD are truly bonus!  The return trip after twenty years and the interview with Tan are magnificent and touching.
Luther had it right: next to the Word of God nothing is as powerful as music --- good music.  It's universal and across time and cultures.",1055116800,13,710,4.7560975609756095
1389615,5,B0000524F6,"I received this DVD for Christmas (thanks to the wish list!) and I found it to be wonderful on many levels. First of all there is Stern's fine playing but this is only a part. There is also the warm interaction between Stern and the eager people of a newly opened China. Stern's engaging personality itself is also enjoyable and his wisdom about music and people is refreshing. This man obviously enjoys life and is very open to all kinds of people, activities and experiences. The film also provides a glimpse into the culture of China that was enlightening including the cultural revolution. The movie has depth and richness. I think most people seeing this movie would feel it was time well spent.",1041379200,11,700,4.699186991869919

I'm an elementary music teacher and there is a condensed version of this documentary on VHS in our textbook series.  I showed this to my fifth grade class and they were in awe.  They had so many questions to ask and were so intrigued.  I never had the fine opportunity of seeing or hearing Mr. Stern live, but I strongly live by the quote he says at the end of the documentary.  It truly is a touching and moving one.",1026950400,11,488,4.094736842105263

unlikely those who first watched the film in public theatres in 1980, I first watched it on a VHS I bought in '89 and it was one of my all time favorities. I managed to loss the tape when I moved several years ago and have been looking up and down for a copy since then. great it is now DVD with better quality.",990662400,,327,3.9696969696969697
1389621,5,B0000524F6,"Isaac Stern gave his personal music lesson to Chinese twenty years ago on how to present colorful live feelings in music.  I personal enjoyed and benefited from it very much, same as my eight years old daughter.  Twenty years later, Isaac Stern revisited China.  It became very interesting that couple of talented kids in Isaac's first trip became arrogant musicians now.
The dialogue was very interesting too.  Isaac Stern replied to Chinese conductor about Mozart that ""music talent as Mozart had particular nothing to do with capitalism"".  Twenty years later, Chinese conductor admitted that Mozart's talent had nothing to do with capitalism and his comment was somewhat political.
I am sure you will enjoy this DVD very much.",986169600,,729,5.1440677966101696
1389622,5,B0000524F6,"I saw the original video production of ""From Mao to Mozart"" 20 years ago as a graduate student in Music.  I was stunned!  Insightful musical instruction, excellent segues of countryside, people, culture, cities.... I vividly remembered scenes from movie...and was thrilled to see them again when PBS aired the new release in mid-Feb, 2001.  It spoke to me both as an Asian and as a musician all the more.
Stern's admonitions and instructions continue to add to my musical life. His advice is timeless and worth considering at all points of a musician's life.  While technique is basic and necessary, expression is everything--and to carry this torch to future generations is the legacy of this video.
The scenes from China: I appreciated the transitions and poignancy all the more after 20 years. Many of the scenes were buried in my memories. I didn't know from where I had picked up those images, but when I saw this reprise of the movie, there they were!  Such is the strength of this documentary.  Stern's return in 1999 is less compelling.  He seems a bit more impatient and the footage does not include much by the translators--an important facet of understanding the cultural differences.  Maybe it's because in 1999 the musicians speak English.  Maybe it's because the film's editor(s) chose to omit the translations. We'll never know.
Quite interesting is the footage of various musicians who met Stern 20 years ago and then appear and perform in 1999.  Very strong musicians with vivid memories of their encounters! And their performances are excellent, full, rich, expressive!
Another interesting facet is Stern's son, David, who also visited 20 years ago and now appears as the guest conductor in the 1999 footage. His comments and conducting are insightful.
The producer's techniques of overlapping the 1979 footage and the 1999 footage is good, but maybe overdone.  I found myself impatient to ""get on with it"" at some times during the 1999 footage.  Too much comparison, especially since we just saw the entire movie earlier.
BUT....a great work.  I'm thrilled that it is now being re-released and may inspire another generation, as Stern continues to inspire past, present, and future generations.",982108800,23,2213,5.0633608815427
1389623,5,B0000524F6,"Extraordinary documentary about Isaac Stern's visit to China in 1979. Inspiring musically, and a fascinating look at life in China at the time, and the effect that the Cultural Revolution had on musicians. Excellent!",1420588800,,216,5.382352941176471
1389624,5,B0000524F6,"I enjoyed this documentary film because of the interviews, the music (both Western and Chinese), and travel scenes.  As part of the opening of China, the violinist Isaac Stern travelled there and met with aspiring musicians.  One theme of the film is that music that is done ""by the book"" can have a flat sound, but when personality and flair is added and in harmony with each violinist's personality, the music can achieve a higher quality.  This is an example of how music has both technical and artistic aspects.  The bonus features are very good and one learns about Mr. Stern's biography and personality as well.",1419206400,,617,4.7924528301886795
1389625,3,B0000524F6,"I watched this movie for a class I was taking in college and thought the movie was ok.  It was more interesting than I was expecting.

The movie starts out pretty strong showing a variety of scenes in China and then discusses Isaac Stern's trip to the country.  However, it shows a lot of his instruction to Chinese students.  Even once the movie has moved on to discuss other things, it keeps coming back to his sessions with students.  This becomes very boring and repetitive and at some points disrupts the flow of the movie.  The Chinese also discuss aspects of their history, such as the Cultural Revolution, but the movie never explains what these events are, which left me stopping the movie to look up the history.  The movie also has a lot of filler where it just pans over scenery and plays music.  This is a movie about music, so some of that is ok, but I felt like some of that tome could have been used more productively, such as discussing history.

Overall, this is an ok movie.  It may be more interesting if you are a fan of classical music or Isaac Stern.",1416787200,,1073,4.401015228426396
1389626,3,B0000524F6,"This is a good peak into China at the end of Mao's Cultural Revolution.  China has come a long way since then, and still has far to go.

1389627,5,B0000524F6,"This is an amazing story of Isaac Stern traveling in China, holding master classes for young musicians, and performing himself.  It is especially significant since it was done in the post-Mao era.",1406332800,,196,5.125
1389628,5,B0000524F6,"To those who love classical music and are knowledgeable about its many different facets, it may seem ridiculously impossible that I never even heard of Isaac Stern until February, 2014.  My musical background is quite varied, however, with a love for that which appeals to my taste, not my training.  As a youngster I learned to play the violin by ear, not notes written on musical scores, and my music of choice then was old country music from a time gone by.  As I matured and my horizons began to broaden, I developed a taste for the old masters of violin; Mozart was (and still is) my favorite for his delightful, joyous compositions that take unexpected and delightful musical detours before returning to the original theme.  Handel, Strauss, Beethoven, Bach and many ""newcomers"" added to the richness of my musical experience, as well.  But when I heard their compositions played by Isaac Stern, I was taken to a new and different dimension; through Stern's interpretation I partook in a glorious, rich fullness I never knew their music contained.  To say that Isaac Stern was a master is a gross understatement; his ear for the ""life"" of music, how it should speak of the depth of human emotion, is quite extraordinary.  He was a stickler for the technical aspect of classical music; however, it was the emotion as expressed in and by the music that most interested him.  Watching the DVD of his inaugural trip to China was not only a visual feast, it awakened my soul to the depth and passion of Isaac Stern's music and his devotion to perpetuating that passion through subsequent generations.  Though he has passed from this life to the next, his legacy is very much alive and well.  I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.  Not only does Mr. Stern show us facets of music we never grasped before, he is a natural performer with great class who engages and dazzles the audience, his students and anyone fortunate enough to watch this DVD.  There is a very good reason it won (and deserved) an Academy Award.  If you have a genuine love for classical music, this DVD will delight you.",1392768000,3,2095,4.706849315068493
1389629,5,B0000524F6,"Marvelous! Even the photo on the front cover of ""From Mao to Mozart"" has heart and soul.  A picture is worth the 1000 plus words of this time in Isaac Stern's life.",1385942400,,164,4.125
1389630,5,B0000524F6,One of the most powerful recordings I have ever seen. I saw this on PBC years ago and finally bought the DVD.

1389642,5,B0000524F6,"Saw this documentary last night, a Netflix disc. Now I've just come home from work, have bought my own copy at Amazon, and am posting this review.

The film will please you if you're a fan of classical music or have an interest in the Orient, especially China. In my case, both.

Had I seen this documentary in 1980, when it first came out, I'd today be a wealthy man. I know I'm a rich man, having a great wife, wonderful children and good health. But I'd also have money in the bank, because I'd have seen back then how industrious, skilled, and intelligent the Chinese are, and would have invested everything I had in that country. It's no secret they're eating our lunch; I now better see how and why. I also now better understand where Amy Chua, the Tiger Mom, is coming from.

Those of us old enough to remember China's Cultural Revolution never expected the country to recover in our lifetimes from that man-made disaster. Yet it took less than a generation. Seeing the bright faces and amazing talent in the young people in this film makes me see why, and makes me almost weep for my own country as I picture so many of our own apathetic, self-indulgent, undisciplined youth.

Aside from the music, the disc has bonus features that are as engrossing as the film itself. One has Isaac Stern returning to China 20 years later and meeting some of the young musicians he taught back then. Just as the children have grown to adults, more remarkable is how Shanghai grew to be the modern metropolis it is today.

Another feature is on Dr Tan, a hero of our times. This is worth the price of the disc all by itself.

There's also a visit by Stern to the Beijing Opera (I think) where four young men and a young woman performed the most amazing feat of gymnastics I may ever have seen.

Can't praise this documentary enough. It's now in my Deserted Island Movies website.",1345852800,,1871,4.469208211143695
1389643,5,B0000524F6,"If you don't already love Isaac Stern, you will after watching this. Not only  is he brilliant on his violin but his love of teaching shines through. He is the teacher you would want to have not just for yourself but for your children.
When I want to  just hear and see great music, this is what I watch.
I  was memorized by the interaction  and joy he has with the talented Chinese  ""students"".
This is worth watching more than once.
It is delightful.

Amazon Verfied purchase! Always the best in my opinion.",1337731200,,509,4.419354838709677
1389644,5,B0000524F6,"It is the most delightful, enchanting DVD I have seen in a long time. Certainly, it will be enjoyed not only by musicians and amateur music lovers but also by music beginners; the last ones mentioned because of such a demonstration of the impact music can have on human minds (on ""animal minds too"", by the way). I was particularly charmed by the performance and interest of the Chinese students and their professors to devote and to make accessible Western music, within such a different cultural upbringing. I wish so much that the opposite will increase - which is to say that Westerners try and start and understand Chinese music, admire the more subtile scales of oriental melodies, the sound of their different instruments). Some years ago a beginning was made in the West not only to appreciate the different tonalities but also to enjoy the different modes of being connected to it. This DVD is
a document worth to be more advertised and to be more ""common knowledge"".",1330646400,,976,4.781065088757397
1389645,5,B0000524F6,This DVD illustrates the huge differences between the US and China at the time in 1980's. It shows how the two cultures started to meet during the critical time.

Seeing young people make their music come to 'life' after the 'cultural revolution' had robbed them of their personality and soul is so powerful. Issac Stern showed time after time that music without the personal energy and soul of the musician is nothing and with words of guidance along with his energy and passion, their music comes to life.

Although he said they were technically proficient, he told them that they needed to learn how to play with passion and from the heart.  His interaction with the students was a joy to behold.  The video was also quite enlightening when a former professor spoke in detail about his imprisonment and torture during the cultural revolution because he was teaching Western music to his students.  I highly recommend this documentary which deservedly received an Academy Award.",1250553600,,596,5.177083333333333

1389654,5,B0000524F6,"Developing the hearts and souls to musical involvement and passion, Isaac Stern meets and plays violin with musicians and gives performances as he tours China.  He finds great technical ability, but a lack of understanding.  He teaches that there is more to music than just playing the notes, but rather making the notes and lines say something, that words cannot express.  As they say in the film, to know the taste of a pear, you must eat it, you cannot study it.  So it is with music, you must play it, experience it, feel it.  You cannot just study it, but you must be involved intimately.  He teaches that the violin is a part of your body, and use the violin to sing as you would sing with your voice.  One little girl was told to sing a phrase she had been playing in.  After she sang it she was able to play it again with the feeling she had when she sang.  Another woman was given demonstrations of phrasing and dancing in the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso.  She had great technical ability to play fast, but played just notes, missing the flirtaciousness of a dance.  Isaac demonstrates it and even does a big of a jig to show her how it works.

The sequel (20 years later) was heartwarming.  Beijing had transformed herself into a modern metropolis.  We meet some of the students and the conductor that had worked with Isaac 20 years ago.  It was a heartwarming reunion.

Special attention to luthiers.  There is a documentary of Shanghai luthier Tan Shu-chen and his life story (in the Extras), his love for violin, his love of music, and his Christian family background.  He was the first Chinese to play in a foreign symphony orchestra.  It also goes through the history of 20th century China.  There is an incident where the violinists were told to go play for the Japanese officers.  Tan refused to play for them and resigned his job.  Also interesting postwar history, how he made it through the war, how he stayed in China after 1949, and how he turned to making violins after becoming director of the Shanghai conservatory with lack of instruments.  He started a small factory, making violins to give to the students free of charge.  He was denounced by a student and his house raided in the Cultural Revolution and imprisoned in a closet in a basement under the stairs and kept away from his violins for more than a year, made to repair toilets, taking care of 122 toilets and taken out for beatings and tortures by the Red Guards.  They poured boiling water into one of the musician's ear deafening him.  17 musicians committed suicide under the harsh treatment and humiliation.  He never thought of suicide because he is a Christian.  He just waited and the sun came out eventually.  Later he was cleared and reinstated in the Shanghai Conservatory.  Later he saw the Red Guard who was convicted for 8 years of prison, and then later worked again in the conservatory kitchen.  He said that if the Guard would talk to him, he would forgive him, and let bygones be bygones.  Forgiveness gives him peace of mind.  It is so wonderful to know that his faith in Jesus Christ has kept him sane and prospering while in such circumstances.  He can now make and play the violins that he so loves.  What an uplifting story.",1220054400,4,3239,4.573913043478261
1389655,5,B0000524F6,"This film is sure to leave you moved and illuminated. Stern's warm, natural persona is an invigorating force, as he encourages young Chinese musicians not just to play musical notes, but to feel them. The lesson is simple: if you feel the joy of the music yourself, you will spread it to all who hear you play. An intimate, revealing glimpse into a first-rate musician and human being, using his special gift to foster unity and understanding.",1183680000,,443,4.766233766233766
1389656,5,B0000524F6,"I came somewhat late to this DVD.  I had seen from Mao To Mozart on television but only recently got a copy of the DVD.  It was a very refreshing reconnection with a phenominal musician and teacher.  I liked the way he worked with the Chinese musicians - having one violinist sing the music and then played like she sang was, to me, inspired but to Stern probably seemed eminently logical in order to help the musician gain a better understanding of the work in front of her.  It is an interesting look at a China that is rapidly disappearing - as the market economy roars ahead less of the old China will remain.  It is also (1980) just after the cultural revolution and here Stern surprises me - he asks where are the young musicians and seems to not realize that a generation of musicians were being ""re-educated"".  I was a little surprised by his question - I would have thought the answer was self-evident.  The return trip to a much different Beijing was equally impressive.  It was great to see the evolution of the young musicians - one a musician in the Hong Kong Symphony, others doing well in their own fields and yes the singing violinist is seen again.  In all, this is a delightful and very interesting musical documentary.  What was a surprise to me was that although I knew Stern had died I was surprised to learn that David Golub had also died - before Stern.  This might be considered a fitting tribute to both men for them to bridge the gap (at that time) between China and the rest of the world.  I recommend this to historians and musicians alike.",1173657600,2,1568,4.444055944055944
1389657,5,B0000524F6,this DVD is excellent for anyone interested in classical music. Issac Stern visits China in the mid 1970's and finds western music is played but not with feeling. He encourages the players he meets and especially the young musicians and finds them very responsive. He revisits 20 years later and hears what happened to music professors during the cultural revolution. He meets again the young players he'd inspired and finds they have successful careers and remember his former visit with gratiude.

1389659,5,B0000524F6,"I'd better not to elaborate the content as it's marvelous and certainly speaks for itself. I just want to mention why I bought this DVD. Months ago, I met an old friend who is a violinist tutor herself and when we chatted about Isaac Stern, she told me that her brother's father-in-law was actually the famous Chinese conductor Mr. Dilun Li in Beijing with whom Isaac worked closely with in the video. And they worked together to help prompting and promoting China to open her door to the world in the 70's through the art of music. Issac & Dilun were two music giants and the artistic exchange between Isaac & the Chinese musicians has proven his genuine attitude and devotion to inspire the next generation musicians.",1168473600,3,719,4.669291338582677
1389660,5,B0000524F6,"This excellent documentary reveals the evolution of Chinese performance of Western music between the seventies & ninties. Stern is regarded as one of the greatest vioninists but this DVD shows his great humanity, ability to communicate and sense of humour. The first segment shows Western music being played in a mechanical, inhibited way. The second segment twenty years later shows an amazing transformation that confirms that music is a universal language. Stern's interaction with the children is particularly moving. I can wholeheartedly recomend this DVD to all lovers of beautiful music. It is a powerful celebration of the human spirit.",1156291200,4,644,5.45
1389661,5,B0000524F6,"I saw this video on PBS years ago and the impressions have always stuck with me. The DVD adds material from 20 years later, as well. A musician should have this DVD and I also recommend the other Isaac Stern DVD that is a bio of his life.

If you are a violinist and like Masterclass videos, there are also violin master class videos available with maestros Jascha Heifetz (10 VHS tapes), Ruggiero Ricci (5 DVDs), Ivan Galamian and Joseph Gingold. Some of them are hard-to-find, but they are there somewhere in cyberspace. Amazon also sells 'Great Violinists of the Bell Telephone Hour' from the years 1959-1964,

where you see many of the great violinists of that era in performance.",1119484800,2,684,4.691666666666666
1389662,5,B0000524F6,"Indeed, as he said, he used ""music as his passport to go to China"", and it's not a ""concert tour"", but a ""how-do-you-do-trip"".
This Maestro's musical power superb, his linguistic power and his power in communication is also superb.
For the music students, particularly the beginners, the Maestro's remarks followed by forceful illustrative demonstrations are just invaluable. Here we are shown tricks as how one may combat with the hard violin on one's shoulder; how to hold it best, and the bow too so that you can get a full and colourful sound etc etc...
Remarks as weighty as general principles are abundant:  music is important to a civilized community; every note in the score has a meaning; the lines are more important than notes;  play the music as though you're composing it; there is life in music, not just notes;  there are so many ways of playing the same note-- here, express it as though you are saying something special to your lover; play it like how you would sing it; the violinis not important, it's just the means and the end is communication... There are equally abundant remarks and demonstrations on rhythm and phrasings along with other expressions in music, all invaluable to most music students and they are particularly targeted at the Chinese students.
Furthermore, we have quite a few invaluable clips of top Chinese musicians, playing 20 years ago when they were small, and then 20 years later when they are matured/maturing, even in the eyes of the world class elites ...
In a way, it's a short and concise history of modern China: there are some rare clips of China before and during the Japanese occupation, and some photos of at the turn of the century; and then how China looked like when she first opened up, including some of the most scenic parts of China like the mountains and landscapes in Kweilin and the bridges of Soo Zhou, parks and streets life and in Shanghai etc.  And eventually what she looks like now: full of skyscapers decorated with eye-catching neon lights...
We also have Chinese performing arts of the HIGHEST ORDER: Chinese musical instruments; Peking opera (including the martial arts as seen on stage); Chinese acrobatics, gymnastics; ping pong players as how they are trained in their early ages; vaudeville ( in particular the minic of sounds of the engine of a train and then various birds etc) etc.
These all juxtaposed with and hence giving depth to the training of young musicians of western music in their boarding school life who suffered so much during the Cultural Revolution where the musicians were treated like ""criminals"", or ""animals""...

7929880,5,B0000524F6,"This is an excellent documentary originally released in 1981, now a portal into China of the past (but with a 30-minute bonus feature of Isaac Stern's return trip to China, 20 years later).  An Academy Award recipient, this film nicely balances the cultural (and slightly political) aspects of Stern's trip with his insights into musical performance.  This film is neither limited to his key instrument, the violin, nor to music alone, although the passion of the performers (and Stern's struggle as a teacher and guide to bring out that passion and insight within others') is certainly a big part of what makes this such an engaging film.  Of course, this was made during the Cold War, just barely after the new leadership and policy in mainland China had made such a trip possible, and as one might expect of persons at that time, the whole circumstance raises a question of whether Stern is meant to be seen as a kind of ""cultural beacon"" in which he alone can teach Chinese musicians about the true soul of the western music that they have already been studying for years, but in the end, things really are about art.  Stern appreciates the Chinese musicians' performance of eastern traditional music as well, and is primarily providing advice to students who have come en masse to see him.  So in the end it does really feel to me like it's about artists and music, rather than a ""westerner"" shining a beacon for what, at the time, was one of the poorest countries in terms of per capita GDP.  Stern's son later became an orchestral conductor working in China, as seen in one of the DVD-extras.  The feature itself is 82 minutes, but with the extras, this contains about 2.5 hours of content.  The second 30-minute feature is about an elderly violinist (92 years-old), who had told about his experience during the Cultural Revolution during the feature film, and provides an expanded commentary about his life as a musician across the 20th Century.  Several of the musicians seen in the feature film are revisited 20 years later in the first featurette.  Very satisfying package.",1466121600,,2084,4.79608938547486

7929884,5,B0000524F6,"Stunning documentary made soon after the end of the cultural revolution. Although it examines Chinese musicians learning how to approach western music through Stern's tutelage, for all artists it suggests technique needs to be balanced by feeling. Stern was a great teacher and this film would make a beautiful companion piece to Ethan Hawke's ""Seymour: An Introduction.""",1427760000,,371,5.526315789473684
7929885,5,B0000524F6,"""Music gives them an opportunity to express themselves individually, although sometimes their society doesn't,"" says Isaac Stern, upon his return to China in 1999.  It was 20 years after the filming of ""From Mao to Mozart: Isaac Stern in China,"" the documentary film that received an Academy Award. The current DVD includes a short film that documents Mr. Stern's 1999 return.  My concern is potential buyers may overlook this current version (indeed it was out-of-print when we ordered it) and not realize the significance of the added bonus material of Stern's 1999 return (because it's not clearly noted), footage that brings perspective (and closure) to what was a truly profound cultural exchange.  If and when ""Mao to Mozart"" gets released again, my suggestion to the producers is to display this information more prominently on the cover.

Not having seen this documentary since its general release in 1980, I was surprised how dated it seemed.  Mr. Stern's humanity shines throughout, and the musicians' response to him is quite touching, but its clear the China he was visiting in 1979, in the wake of the disastrous ""Cultural Revolution,"" was in a state of recovery and woefully behind the West. Having said that, the bonus footage of his return in 1999, brings the uniqueness of the cultural exchange full circle.  The China we see (from the footage taken in Beijing) has changed dramatically: there are now skyscrapers, open-air markets with abundant fresh food, streets flowing with cars and pedestrians--alas, a modern world, unlike the grey, empty, somber and economically depressed world of 1979.  More importantly, the people had changed significantly as well.  We see what became of several them.  Pan Chun, the gifted pianist, is now a professor at the Beijing Conservatory; Vera Tsu, the equally gifted violinist, is now concert mistress of the Hong Kong Philharmonic; and Wang Jiang, the Cellist and perhaps the most promising of the three, is now a performer on the world stage.  Stern again is the teacher -- encouraging, exhorting, hugging.  His passion for music is as strong as ever, but this time his comments are more telling: ""You can't study life, you must live it . . . every note is your life, an important part of that life you are living . . . being a musician is not a profession, and it's not just a job; it is not something vocational, it's the totality of your life and your devotion to something in which you believe profoundly . . .  and you have to believe in order to make other people believe.""  And finally, perhaps most telling: ""Music is not important for creating musicians, it's creating a civilized society.""  Indeed, Mr. Stern is telling us that music is a civilizing force: humane, tolerant, nonjudgemental, hopeful.  It's what draws worlds together, despite cultural and political differences, past and present.  It's the hope of humanity.  Five stars.",1425254400,3,2904,5.004158004158004
