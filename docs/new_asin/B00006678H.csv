1711459,5,B00006678H,"I really enjoyed this DVD and thought it was a wonderful look into the King's private life.  Joe allows us to see hundreds of of rare and never before seen photos, which I thought were well worth the price of the DVD.  There are also newsreels of Elvis and Joe does a wonderful job of telling us his recollections of his time with the King.
I have seen most of Elvis's movies and biographical movies such as ""This is Elvis,"" ""Elvis, That's The Way it Is"" and ""Elvis On Tour,"" which I love and highly recommend.  This, however, for the first time, allowed me to find out intimate, private details that I never would have known about otherwise.
Joe tells so many interesting tidbits and answers some questions I've always wondered about all these years.  I also appreciate the fact that Joe was Elvis's friend from the time they met in the Army until Elvis's death.  He was loyal and never turned his back on Elvis.  You can tell Joe really loved Elvis and Elvis's family and we should feel honored that he allowed us to get a glimpse into their most private lives.  This is a very sentimental and at times funny glimpse into Elvis's private life, while always staying tasteful as Joe never says anything negative about Elvis's family and friends.  I have a lot of respect for him after watching this film.  Elvis was lucky to have such a trustworthy and loyal friend!
There is also a touching tribute song to Elvis towards the end that I thought was beautiful and Joe's touching recollection of Elvis's death really broke my heart.  You won't be disappointed by this DVD if you love Elvis they way I do!!!!",1030233600,17,1605,4.522491349480969
1711460,5,B00006678H,"Thank you Mr. Esposito for making this DVD.  I would recommend this DVD to any Elvis fan.  Mr. Esposito shows the very human side to a very large KING.  From Elvis's early days to the unexpected end of his short life.  This DVD had many pictures which I had never seen.  It is very interesting to see that Elvis really was just like everyone else.
Mr. Esposito really cared about Elvis and was a real friend to him.
This was well done,  I believe Elvis would have liked it,  so will you.",1029974400,7,487,4.228260869565218
1711461,2,B00006678H,"First of all, when you buy a DVD that is not ""official"" - and that includes most of the documentaries made these days - you won't get to listen to any Elvis-music at all. And in this case, you hardly even see Elvis perform.
What you get is 1 hour of picture after picture, while Joe Esposito tells you his stories. The stories are a little shallow, they give you the overview and nothing more.
There's also a few glimpse of the press-conference at Graceland in 1960 with sound (about a minute), you see Frank Sinatra and Elvis TALK on the Welcome Home-show from Miami (20 seconds), that's about all you hear from Elvis. You also see a few glimpse from a 1950's newsreel, the press-conference after the wedding etc. No sound. Oh yeah, and there's about a minute from the famous b/w-footage done at Hayride in '57 where you see Elvis rockin' and rolling. Great footage, but it has been shown on many documentaries.
The bonus-material is mainly (junk). 6 chapters, and one is about  the world's craziest Elvis-fan. Another chapter is about Elvis-impersonators, but you don't see them perform! There's also one that shows two news-reports from August 1977. Here they added about 30 seconds with J.D. Sumner from an interview done right after Elvis died, and all he says is ""except for Jesus Christ, there was no bigger man""..
Basically this DVD is for the die-hard collector. It's nice to hear a story or two about Elvis, but an hour of stories mainly accompanied by pictures just gets boring.",1028764800,12,1489,4.683206106870229

1711505,4,B00006678H,"This was a great interview from Joe...Also excellent pictures of Elvis...Great stories, but wish he would have gotton alittle more honest about his personal struggles...Overall interested",1408233600,,187,6.230769230769231
1711506,3,B00006678H,"As all of us know , we Elvis fans never get enough information about him. This book offers just another little peek inside. Not great but not terrible either.....",1378857600,,162,4.620689655172414

1711509,3,B00006678H,"A DVD about Elvis and his best friend. His ""second"" Best man and his Best Friend (along with Red West, Charly Hodge, and George Klein).

That's okay.

This documentary is a bonanza for even casual Elvis fans, filled with rare photos and footage, crystal clear. Especialy if you are interested in the period of Elvis' marriage, 1967 to 1973, you'll love many still pictures, actually much better than we have seen 17 million times.

Those fans who are also musicians or Presley record collectors, on the other hands, will have little use for this DVD. Esposito does not srike me as a guy who can recognize an E-chord from an e-mail; nothing about the recording sessions. Nothing at all controversial, nothing critical of his work, and even the most serious Elvis fan want to know why he could not insist on better scripts.

Joe was in several of Elvis' flicks and the fan who enjoys EP movie nostalgia/memorabilia *will* dig this item, as it seems JE has alot more memories about Hollywood alot of this item
...alot more than Nashville!

Talkin' 'bout Elvis pictures, Joe mentions that Elvis liked making ""Harum Scarum"" - considered by many to be his worst movie, by far. Elvis dressed as the Shiek sounds fun to a point...but a first-class Director and Writer is needed to turn a weak musical for teens into something memorable. Priscilla Presley wrote - as I recall - that Elvis loved making the picture in the beginning - he'd come back to the house still in makeup because he looked pretty great in all that ""desert"" attire - but soon he realized it was another depressing buck-grabber.

Esposito seems to really enjoy playing Host-Narrator; his sincerity is obvious. If you bought Joe's GOOD ROCKING TONIGHT book on the Big El, you should have this product.

[DVD version has eleven extra chapters, with more rare ""memorabilia""].",1309392000,,1833,4.8
1711510,3,B00006678H,"I thought this DVD was just O.K. No new information for a true Elvis fan. Just repeat of delightful stories. Basically, it is a white wash about the KIng. However, I think it is good to focus on the positive side from time to time. Now if you want to get a full view of the King's life, I think you should buy Esposito's book, ""Good Rockin tonight"".",1294704000,,349,4.147058823529412
1711511,1,B00006678H,"Anyone who buys this DVD is soiling the Elvis legacy! Esposito was a mere friend that hung onto The KINGS coat tails. George Kline was the true BEST FRIEND of Elvis. He was friends with Elvis before the Army and before the Louisiana Hayride days all the way til the King died. And now carries on the positives that Elvis gave of himself via the Elvis channel on Satellite radio. George was his true Best Friend and if you ask any of the Memphis Mafia who was closest to Elvis, they would say George! Esposito was trying to get a buck by putting this together as some of his so called friends did, but George has never tried to prosper from Elvis or his death! I am appauld that Amazon would allow this to be sold and i'm upset that he got away with it after his family didn't want it released. His, so called friend released it with the family of Elvis saying NO!! That is just dispicable! And very tasteless, so please people don't support this DVD. It may be a good DVD in my opinion when I saw a pre-release showing, but it was not what the people who loved Elvis wanted out there. It is unforgivable to do something like this that involves someones death against their family wishes!",1247616000,,1187,4.327354260089686

I highly recommend them also. Great Job Joe.",1213660800,,740,4.548872180451128
1711541,1,B00006678H,"If Joe E thinks he was Elvis' best friend, then Elvis had no decent friends at all. Very likely, Elvis was his best friend, and see what that got him!

Gee, everyone wants his best friend to tell such warped private details of said best friend's life after he dies.... Doesn't he?!?!?!?

Elvis was gifted, brilliant, a warm and loving human being. But you won't know that from Joe's book or many of the other Memphis Mafia books.

But it does serve to make Joe look good - which seems to be a trait of those called the Memphis Mafia - true leeches, now moving into their 70's, but still vying for top dog position - and nearly all of them are STILL sucking on the memory of Elvis for every last dime they can pull from his good deeds turned ugly by them.

And, in every book Joe has written, his story changes. What is truth? Where's the mention you sued Elvis after coercing him in to the racquetball deal? How about that you were double dipping and being paid as a spy for the Colonel to control and eventually ruin Elvis, but never told him or made it right?

Truth? Joe never knew it. Friendship? Joe knows even less about this subject than he knows about truth....Sorry, Joe, with friends like you.... who needs enemies?",1207526400,4,1225,4.378854625550661
1711542,2,B00006678H,"This is a 2 hour 10 minute documentary that seems to be a cross between any ET television segment and a typical timeshare travelog video. The home videos, including extented interview segments not usually seen in the usual Elvis rehash documentaries, are worthwhile just to hear Elvis' thoughts in his own words. I had hoped this documentary would be enlightening to show a more balanced (and honest) view of Elvis' duality, since Elvis is usually portrayed as somewhere between an ""angel with a broken wing"" to a lost sinner, but this documentary tends to portray Elvis as a downright neutered cream-puff hearts-and-flowers cherub without a shred of the raw masculine romantic seducer who captured the hearts of millions during his lifetime and after. I had hoped that Diamond Joe would set the record straight, considering he really was Elvis' right-hand man for 20 years, but this movie makes it clear his strings were connected to Elvis Presley Enterprises. The Machine is still running, and Elvis is still lost behind the smoke-screen of media illusion. Elvis never stopped being a man, but his friends seem to have turned him into a shrine, just a picture on the wall, angelic voices in the background, a halo of remembrance -- and the essence of Elvis as dead as vinyl. If you're looking for any true character insight about Elvis, stay away from this documentary. Hero worship and exploitation are a bad combination, and this movie shows the real heartbreak of knowing a man such as Elvis for 20 years, yet apparently having no clue who that man really was. If you want to know the true Elvis, listen to his music, watch the movies and concerts you like, and remember that Elvis never lied about himself. Elvis laid down, but at least he didn't sell out. Loyalty was one of the few qualities Elvis really expected from people close to him. The test of that loyalty might be measured by who kept their silence. After seeing this documentary, I'm thankful to all the people close to Elvis who have kept their mouths shut. Let the music speak for itself -- that was how Elvis spoke to the world. There's no Elvis music in this video, which is probably just as well. The music would have been sanitized, too.",1136505600,10,2212,4.748051948051948
1711543,5,B00006678H,"Joe Esposito gives a more intimate potrayal from a perspective of the close, personal friend he was. Although it is obvious he remains loyal and enjoyed his years with The King of Rock and Roll, Joe gives a somewhat different perspective that what most fans are accustom. It's refreshing, especially from fans who have ""read it all.""",1124755200,2,333,4.859649122807017
1711544,5,B00006678H,"A special, intimate look to the person and the artist Elvis Presley with many unseen footage and pictures from the artist of the century..... A must for every Elvis-Fan!!!!",1060041600,,172,4.9655172413793105
1711545,3,B00006678H,"This is a very positive, upbeat tribute to Elvis by his top man and best friend, Joe Esposito.  He avoids the negative topics that has already been covered endlessly by the media, and focuses on more folksy  and humorous stories about the King. At times I wish he could have talked more in depth about some of the topics, instead of including chapters about the impersonators, the biggest fan, the nuttiest fan. I could have done without that information. I'm sure Joe has a lot more interesting Elvis anecdotes to share, and to see such rubbish included brings this DVD down a couple of stars in my book.
Still, it is refreshing to view a kinder portrait of Elvis by someone close to him instead of the vitriol dished out by West, & Co in their book written by Steve Dunleavy.  Elvis deserves better, and so do his fans, so if you're looking for the more sensationlistic Elvis information, you won't find it in this DVD.
It is interesting to note that a few years back, Joe Esposito was embroiled in a battle with EP Enterprises (read: Priscilla), who tried to force him to surrender his private collection of movies and photos of Elvis he'd taken over the years. Perhaps this DVD is the result of a compromise that was reached.",1045267200,13,1229,4.552036199095022
1711546,1,B00006678H,The title suggested that this dvd would portray an intimate glimpse into the personal life of Elvis through the remembrances of his best friend.  It is a redo of many previous movie clips and snapshots. I felt as though I had seen this dvd before in many of the previous vhs tapes about Elvis that I own.,1040774400,4,304,4.333333333333333
1711547,3,B00006678H,"The previously private bits and pieces presented by Joe Esposito are most welcome. Still photos, newsreel footage, etc., never seen by the public make this offer worthwhile.
It seems Elvis had [three] best friends, [songwriter / actor / bodyguard] Red West, Gospel-C & W star/musical mentor Charlie Hodge, and Mr. Esposito. That's okay, I'm just surprised that these other names are mostly vacant from the proceedings. [Historians-fans check out Charlie's good video ""The Elvis I Knew"", Decker Television, 1994].
Joe does not dwell on Elvis 1960s' commercial slump nor his 1970s' personal struggles. Just once I'd love to hear how a creative force like Presley managed to deal with bad picture after bad picture. Esposito simply says they were escapist endeavours, and that's that - one must assume that the ""Star Is Born"" rejection by The Colonel was an issue with Elvis and his closest companions. The stars' prescription drug problem has been recounted enough by now, though, so the program does not suffer by lack of address to it.
The tape runs 130 minutes with about 20 unnecessary minutes. The narrative runs chronologically about to the point it should close, but suddenly we're going back in time again, and then we are treated to some dedicated (to say the least) cameos with Elvis imitators and other ardent supporters. So J.E. gives them their ""15"" minutes of fame. Why not?
Ofcourse there are areas of Presley's life which many find still mysterious - his actual law enforcement credentials and the reportedly planned Grand Jury proceedings to take place on/prior to 08-15-1977 relevant to the idea that Vernon and Elvis Presley were victims of [trick].

This really shows us what it was like to know the king. The chapters that focus on his death are the most haunting of all...
Seeing all the footage of the funeral was humbling... people really love this guy... As to the guy who called the extra chapters, junk... I think that you need to go back and look at it again. I think that it was nice to see people signing the Wall at Graceland... The music was very fitting...
