Those who dig the sleaze factor may find some amusement in Cybernator, but for me it was so trashy I couldn't stand more than 15 minutes.",1034985600,,276,4.653061224489796
7913936,5,B00000JZJY,"A top rating is rendered this DVD for the performance of Richard
Norton in ""Hyperspace.""  In a cast of familiar names, most notably Ron O'Neal of ""Superfly"" fame, Norton gives the film its
best performance.  He's trapped in a spaceship -- doomed to
travel space for decades -- and only one person from the crew can ride the escape vehicle back home for an attempt to arrange
a rescue of unlucky travelers.  Straws are pulled, and one person wins...but the rest of the crew are not eager to honor the
results of the lottery!  Sci Fi is always best served with a mix
of action and a touch of humor.  True to form, Norton delivers!",1005523200,2,628,4.426086956521739
