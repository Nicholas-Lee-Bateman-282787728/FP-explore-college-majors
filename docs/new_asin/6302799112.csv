512623,5,6302799112,"This is and will always be one of my favorite films! Gena Rowlands was absolutely unforgettable as Gloria. She deservedly won a Best Actress Oscar nomination for the role. The little boy John Phillips was adorable as Phil,  ""I'm the man!"" Everything from the story and direction by John  Cassevetes was terrific to the score by Bill Conti. I will always remember  this film. It is in my Video collection! I will continue to enjoy it over  and over. babymldaol.com Don't miss this one!! Forget the remake it has  nothing to offer.  is",917654400,4,533,4.67741935483871
512624,5,6302799112,"Loved this movie from the first time I saw it.
Just saw the Sharon Stone version....don't waste your time folks! My husband wanted to walk out of the theater but I wanted to stay until the end. It was very disappointing  and full of 4 letter words.
Gena Rowlands did't say one if I recall.  She's a real classy dame!!!!!!!!  Denver",917481600,3,331,4.39344262295082
512625,5,6302799112,"From the incredibly moving score to the incredibly moving story, this film is a winner all the way. It is a true sleeper. I love introducing it to friends and family.  See it once and you will return to it again and again.  Gena Rowlands is magnificent as the title character. A woman who perhaps  hasn't done right in the past; who grows determined to ""do right""  now through her assosciation with a little boy.  She is beautiful, brassy,  and smart. She also has a wardrobe by Ungaro and the eye of a sharp  shooter. When she jams her 45 into the mobster's back and growls ""Ya  let a woman beat ya""....I dare ya not to smile. I hope that amazon.com  sells will be selling the soundtrack. The music is haunting. Enjoy!",917308800,5,719,4.386363636363637
512626,5,6302799112,"I saw the movie when it originally came to theaters and loved it then.  I love it even more on video.  The relationship between Gloria and Phil was truely special.  I loved the fact that nearly 20 after the film was  originally released it still has a modern theme.  I watched the video with  my 20 year old niece and she enjoyed it.  The acting and directing was  wonderful. The film has a ""low budget"" feeling like the lives  it's charaters lived.  The dialog was quick, witty, and real.  The actor  who played Phil was great.  He was able to hold his own with Gena Rowlands  and that says a lot!!!  Toward the end, I was rooting for Gloria to shot  someone else (sorry to say!!). I won't give away the ending but I think  even the roughest heart will enjoy this 'odd couple'.",916790400,5,778,4.291666666666667

512658,5,6302799112,Gloria was released in 1980. It starred Gena Rowlands. A gun moll you don't want to mess with. I loved this ! Fans of Gena Rowlands will like this the most.,1506384000,,156,4.064516129032258

512660,5,6302799112,"Without all the words, I'm going to say that Gena Rowlands made the part hers. Watching this movie would make you think that gena Rowlands is Gloria. She was nominated for an Academy award for this role. She plays a tougher then nails ex-con, street wise woman who don't take no smack with a demeanor to back it up. When her maternal instincts kick in, she's a force to be recound with and also a heart. Gena Rowlands is excellent. This is a must watch.  The remake should have use Ellen Barkin instead of Sharon Stone.",1503014400,,519,4.40625

512663,5,6302799112,"I remember the Movie being very popular in 1980 when I was 17 years old. Never watched it because I lived in a family whom are still caught up in a religious cult.

Anyway, I always thought the song by Laura Branigan - Gloria [1982] was the theme song for the movie. So, I rented the movie ""Gloria"" (which I thought was really well made {for the time period}), and found out that the songis not in the movie  and in fact it was popular 2 years after the movie. It made more sense now, because the lyrics didn't go with the plot of the movie.  Any way, I just wanted to give my feedback, and let everyone one know that both the movie   and songare good, and apparently not related.

Have a good one,

512715,5,6302799112,Funny and action-packed.  This dame does what she needs to do to help the hapless kid--whether she likes it or not.  Gena Rowlands is terrific as the blowsy gun moll who finds herself the unlikely guardian of a six-year-old with a mouth on him.  New York of the '70s is quite a character.  Cassavetes has a languorous style that somehow fits perfectly with shooting guys on the streets.,1468713600,2,386,4.632352941176471

The kid is cute, but his acting is so bad, and so is the rest of the cast. The film overall atmosphere seems to be sleazy and not convincing. The killing of the family in the apartment was only showed with a loud explosion, but that's it. So, one didn't know the kid's family was killed until it is told on the news. Thus, you don't feel for the kid in this film as you would for Mathilda in Leon: The Professional.",1463961600,,609,4.161016949152542

The acting was good, not great, I never felt involved. I was kind of left with the feeling ""why is she doing this"" and the boy, ""why does he run after her and then turn away'? Maybe I have seen too many Mob related movies. Now, if true, that would be a sad situation indeed.",1446422400,,431,4.142857142857143

512810,5,6302799112,"Many fans have already commented on the story itself, and on Gena Rowlands perfect performance. I don't know if anyone has commented on the the MONSTER theme song by Bill Conti.

The movie opens with the musical theme of a gorgeous Spanish Guitar and  anguished gypsy lament and adds a tormented saxaphone- no doubt echoing the  entrance of Julie Carmen's anguished character,  and ultimately, of her son. It really does capture  New York as it was in the 1970's and early 1980's.

The saxophone Score  moves sadly and beautifully from the art of the opening credits to  Manhattan as it is waking with the rising  sun, seamlessly transporting  the viewer to the gritty Bronx, where the movie begins.

Poignant and beautiful. The theme song alone, is worth the price of the the DVD.",1441843200,,781,4.796992481203008

512865,5,6302799112,"This film exists in a select group with other similar works like Leo The Professional (1994) and Man On Fire (2004) with a familiar theme of childhood innocence needing protection from a tough emotionally unavailable protagonist who eventually opens them-self up to the vulnerability and tenderness of loving and being loved again. Gena Rowlands' performance is magnificent as the tough, streetwise gun moll drawn into a situation where she must either help protect a neighbors child from the clutches of corrupt cops and organized criminals or turn her back and leave him to his fate. I searched and searched to find this older film on DVD and eventually purchased it to add to my collection with the other two films mentioned above. If you've not seen this film, make room in your schedule and on your DVD shelf to do so. Tremendous film if somewhat dated. Definitely a classic and one of Gena Rowlands best works.",1429228800,2,916,4.878205128205129

512904,5,6302799112,"For YEARS I have wanted ""Gloria"" on dvd, even keeping my vhs copy so I had one of John Cassavette's best films. Gena Rowlands is Gloria, a retired Mafia ""girlfriend"" ( ""I'm what you call one of those sensations"",  she says jokingly at one point about her relationship with her ""friends""... who are now looking for her and the 6 year old boy she is protecting). Rowlands plays Gloria,  a woman who planned for a quiet future with her cat and her (amazing!) wardrobe, cash in the safe deposit box, no more Mob boyfriends. Instead, she is trying to keep safe a fairly obnoxious kid who has his father's Mob accounting book in his possession. New York City is no fairytale that the ""Sex In the City"" lightweights would feel safe traipsing down the street in (late 70s, early 80s rundown, dirty, the subways and gypsy cabs beat up and looking like they should have wavering odor lines around them). People wearing awful polyester and smoking, every glass storefront splashed with filth. Gloria, cornered and scared, reacts reflexively and shoots a car full of Mafia muscle, killing them. She then hails a taxi and continues to try to get herself and Phil, her sawed-off tough guy, out of NYC, before they both end up dead. One scene that has always made me get goosebumps is when she is on the subway, and she pulls a gun on the mobsters trying to get her and Phil... backing out of the subway car, her face a mask of smile and anger, her beauty turned inside out as she taunts the men trying to get her, the gun huge in the middle of the frame. In that scene, Cassavettes and Rowlands create a new type of cinema heroine : tough, capable of violence, independent. No need of being rescued, thanks. ""Don't hold back, I'd love it !"" she yells, before hauling ass out of there. Rowlands is at turns brutal, cynical, and bewildered that her circumstances have flipped entirely. Her bravada while trying to escape with the kid is far more touching than any maternal heroine could have ever been. ""Gloria"" is the first movie to put the heroine fully in charge of herself... The music and landscape of a battered NYC set a mood that is on par with an opera. Cassavettes' letting his actors improv makes the stress more realistic... young John Adames has moments of very believable dialogue and reactions... he is a little jerk at times, but what six year old isn't ? The end of the movie is too good to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it. Not a film for fidgety people who need explosions and car chases every two minutes... this is much more of a film about two people who would under normal circumstances not be travelling together.",1425340800,,2624,4.533755274261603

512912,4,6302799112,"Your affinity for ""Gloria"" depends on whether you will accept Buck Henry as a Puerto Rican mob accountant.  Matters aren't helped that the goons pursuing Gloria (Gena Rowlands) and young Phil (John Adames) are at best imbecilic cartoonish buffoons.  You scratch your head wondering how the two race around New York in plain sight when they are the subject of around-the-clock news coverage.  It would also have been nice if director-writer John Cassavetes could have tightened things up because the two hour plus running time is more than enough time to tell this tale.  These reservations aside I still like this film and despite minor misgivings I give it my recommendation. Why? Primarily for the terrific performance by Rowlands as the former mob moll who probably had to lick more than her fair share of the fuzzy side of the lollipop and sees in the opportunity to protect Phil long suppressed maternal feelings being realized.  Six year old Adames is a precocious tyke and he and Rowlands have terrific exchanges that are worth the price of admission.  There won't be a dry eye in the house when you see the final freeze frame.  A mixed blessing but a blessing nonetheless.",1421366400,,1180,4.87

512966,5,6302799112,"What more can be said? Gena takes an opportunity to play one of her more 'together' women. She is known for taking risks in her films with Cassavettes and this stands out as their most commercial film together. A woman who hates kids goes on the lam with a six year old puerto rican boy in tow. They make an incredibly odd couple. Until the murder of Phil's parents her life is settled she has a cat, nice clothes money in the bank and is having an affair with a mafia don. Forced into a maternal role, she bundles Phil out of the apartment building they both live in by making him pretend its all just a dream. She fiercely defends her young charge the way a lioness defends her cubs. There is a moment later in the film where she tries to get Phil to run away...""I'm old...and out of shape"" she tells him before fate forces her to kill to defend him. Rowlands runs all over New York creating a character that is vibrant, sassy and not afraid to pull a few tricks to get what she needs. It was never a film the critics were kind about because it departed from Cassavettes usually introspective territory. Here Rowlands and her charge are thrown out into the wilds of New York. She cannot fry eggs to save her life but she can put the bad guys on the ground so fast you wouldn't hold a pan full of burned fried eggs against her.

512998,5,6302799112,"I never saw GLORIA in its original release and got very excited when I had the chance to see it recently in a DVD released by Columbia/Sony in Italy.  Cassavetes' film is terribly exciting and breathes late 1970's New York City in a hot summer day.  For me at least, GLORIA is Gena Rowlands and I will never bother to see the Sharon Stone version, as much as I admire her as an actress.  Gena Rowlands is usually excellent in everything she does, and I have never seen her make a false gesture or give a mediocre performance.  I love her Gloria from beginning to end: it is human, it grows on you, it lets you see the character evolve in a very gripping, ultimately moving way.  I must say I hated the kid from the start and wonder how Gloria could have stood him.  Cassavetes was very ingenious when he made the whole Puerto Rican family so unsympathetic, even if their massacre by the mob cannot in any way be morally justified.  They are just poor people, caught up in a life of crime as thousands of others then and now. I do believe, however, that John Adames was not the best choice for the role, even though he looks the part of a 6-year-old Puerto Rican boy.  This child actor could not act.  He is simply there, as most nonactors are when employed as actors in a film.  Perhaps that was what Cassavetes wanted: someone to react to a superb actress who pretty well carries the weight of their every scene together. I also think that, should the happy end have been avoided, and Gloria died in the elevator, the scene in the cemetery in Pittsburgh would have acquired a beauty and a pathos that the actual ending does not have. Still, it is wonderful and heart-warming to see Gloria and Phil together, finally reunited, a new life before them. The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.  It deserved it.",1405987200,2,1825,4.401785714285714

513038,3,6302799112,"Discovered John Cassavetes the fine actor in Rosemary's Baby but this film is where I discovered John Cassavetes, the great director. Outstanding acting, especially the doomed mom of the little boy, and the mobsters, who seemed very authentic to me. Opening sequences are very strong and you believe this family is in trouble, and also that you would not want to be them. Gloria and the boy bond as they run for their lives, and Gloria shows, when push comes to shove, that she is a warrior. Negatives for me included the beautiful but sometimes overly busy soundtrack, and the sometimes overly feisty kid. Kids, though inexperienced, are very smart and have a strong survival instinct. Just don't see a kid misbehaving in a life threatening situation to the extent this kid did. I can see them screaming in terror, wetting themselves, becoming exhausted from having to constantly run, in fact an adult would have to carry them much more than is presented in this story.  To see a kid arguing with his only caregiver in a life threatening situation, just not believable: he'd be too terrified.  A six year old is a first grader. I can maybe see a mouthy first grader when all is fine in his world (though not really even then: an impish 9 year old is more believable), but in a life threatening situation where he's running for his life after his mother, father, grandmother and sister have been brutally murdered, uh, no. A 6 year old would be a whimpering mess after all that, heck your average adult would be a whimpering mess. If Cassavetes wanted him to be believably tougher, he should've written him older. Gena Rowlands is outstanding, but because the 6 year old's pulling behavior is not believable within the context of his family just having been slaughtered (he'd have clung to her absolutely traumatized, not fought with her (though I admit to liking and laughing at his I Am The Man statements), it impacted my perception of her character. She does solid work here, and the kid who plays the 6 year old is good, his acting is mostly solid. The problem is in the writing. I understand why Cassavetes wanted him feisty and very young, to ignite Gloria's respect (that a little kid could even remain functional after the trauma he was put through) and protective instincts, but didn't work for me. He needed to be a few years older and not fighting Gloria as much as he did. He could've still been strongwilled, just not as recalcitrant. Overall, pretty decent film. 3 and 1/2 stars.",1385942400,,2494,4.704805491990847

513099,5,6302799112,"While watching `Gloria' this past weekend, I couldn't help but think about how the Lead Actress lineup in 1980 was just ridiculously great.  It reminds me of the lineup in 2004, in that there is not a bad performance in the bunch.  In fact, I would consider nominating all five women myself.  Sissy Spacek, Ellen Burstyn, Goldie Hawn, Mary Tyler Moor and Gena Rowlands.  They were all superb and so vastly different.  I don't often applaud the Academy for daring choices, but this lineup is worthy of all the praise we can give them.

John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands made an unstoppable team.  They made ten films together and quite honestly, they are some of the best films ever made.  Rowlands, under the directorial hand of her husband, pulled out some of cinema's greatest actorly achievements, and `Gloria' is one of them.

While watching `Gloria', I was reminded of a small independent film starring Tilda Swinton that was released back in 2009; `Julia'.  In both films you have an unlikely heroine, a tough as nails woman who isn't too keen on being saddled with a child.  In both films the protagonist, who is also somewhat the antagonist in parts, shifts her perception of her lifestyle and priorities thanks to the bonding relationship with the child.  Both films are anchored by a stunning and deeply grounded performance (both Rowlands and Swinton are aces in their parts), and both films rely on sharp directing to carry the suspense needed to round out the film.  `Gloria' follows an ex-mafia mistress who winds up taking care of a young boy after his father, who was secretly working for the mob, and the rest of his family (mother, sister, grandmother) are murdered.  Gloria takes Phil on the run from a group of `bad men' who happen to be friends of Gloria's.  Gloria, while not happy with her current predicament, slips into the motherly protective role rather effortlessly.  It isn't a role that fits perfectly on her, which is seen by her constant prickliness, but she assumes it and carries it through, even if that means putting her own life at risk for a child she finds a nuisance.

Rowlands is flawless here, showing such emotional depth and progression throughout the film's running.  The technical aspects here are also stunning.  The production design (those rooms), the score (so earthy) and Cassavetes direction (so intimate) are all beautifully explored.  Despite young John Adames Razzie win, I found his performance somewhat naturalized.  He was a bratty kid thrust into a traumatic situation.  He was stiff in parts, but he bled a naturalism I really appreciated.  Parts of the films center can seem a tad repetitive, but overall this film really, really works.  It is a crime thriller, a genre film, but it is elevated thanks to some beautiful acting and sharp direction.",1336348800,2,2808,4.875527426160337

513115,2,6302799112,"Spoiler alert: Buck Henry gets wasted in more ways than one. Not only some mobsters whack him at the outset of the movie, but he exits without providing it with a much needed script! Instead he leaves behind a book of records the mafia desperately wants (well, not so desperately it seems, since Gloria hands it to them a few times and they hesitate to take it) and an orphan: Buck Henry's Puerto Rican son (yes; you read that correctly). He's your average pre ""Welcome Back Kotter"" obnoxious little brat, complete with Afro hairdo, an attitude, some Jackson-5 clothes and a few phrases in Spanish. You are expected to find him cute. He in turn is bequeathed to Gloria, an over-the-hill moll neighbor who happens to drop in for a cup of sugar in the nick of time, and also happens to be played by Gena Rowlands. She's the only reason to see the movie.

Together she and the brat do the things one expects from a gal and a kid in a gangster film, like walking out of Penn Station clutching a gun in plain view, crossing all the way through Madison Square Garden Plaza to 42nd Street, catching a cab and having the driver wait for them while they stop by to shoot some bad guys -in The Bronx! Or meeting in a place they've never agreed upon before, or whacking a car full of thugs armed to the teeth, in midday, on the sunny side of the street.

I mean, if this wasn't a Cassavetes film, or if it didn't feature the steely beauty of his wife in the title role, one would trash this half-baked C-movie in the nearest dustbin. As it's often the case, it's considered a cult film. You know; one of those movies you haven't seen but read about how great they are?

I love this movie, I love strong, powerful women, and I love Gena Rowlands, who is one of my favorite actresses.  As a matter of fact, this is the film that introduced this amazing talent to me all those years ago.  As a lifelong fan, I've watched every film that she has appeared in since viewing the film ""Gloria"" and I often revisit ""Gloria"" as well.  It's a totally engaging story, and one cannot help rooting for Gloria and Young Phil to survive and triumph over it all.
Directed by the late, great John Cassavetes (1929-1989)""Gloria"" is the tale of an embittered, one-time gangster's girlfriend who is not necessarily looking for absolution as much as she is seeking peace of mind.  However, when fate intervenes, Gloria has to choose between self-preservation or protecting the young life that has been entrusted to her.  Filmed in and around New York City in the late 1970's this film is infused with a gritty realism that is often lacking in films of this genre.  The acting is top notch, and Gena Rowlands chews the scenery with her fiery, tough as nails performance. John Adames is simply adorable as the young victim, and he manages to hold his own with the great Gena Rowlands.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of director John Cassavetes, actress Gena Rowlands, or gangster films in general.
An interesting tidbit for you horror movie fans:  The beautiful and talented Julie Carmen, (Regine Dandridge of Fright Night Part II) appears in a brief cameo role as Phil's mother. Great Movie, a truly great movie.
If the Mob were ever after me, I would definitely want Gloria to protect me!

Nothing except watch her strut her stuff (and pull that trigger!) I hadn't seen this movie since it originally came out in theaters many years ago. I knew she had left a strong imprint on my psyche but I didn't remember exactly why until I saw the movie again. What can I say? I absolutely love Gena Rowlands.
I have one argument with the folks who promote this film. The star here is Gena and NOT Julie Carmen (minor role in the picture.) Get with it people (or I'll tell Gloria and you don't want her angry with you!)",1251936000,3,643,4.4491525423728815

Then, the parents are killed and the Gloria has to get herself and the kid out of there. It's not as easy as it looks, particularly for a woman who clearly doesn't have a maternal bone in her body. And Phil doesn't understand what's happened.

""It's all a bad dream,"" she tries to tell him, but pretty quickly, the reality gets even worse.  The mob is after Gloria, who they know.

Odd pairing films are always fascinating, but this tough ex mob girl, who only wants to live out her life in peace, and young Puerto Rican kid together keep you riveted to the screen. Phil's understandably angry and Gloria doesn't know how to deal with him.

Gena Rowlands is an amazingly gifted actress and John Adames, who is only in this one film, does a great job, too. One warning, you start watching you will want to be sure you are not interrupted.  And you might just want to share the film with friends as well.

513156,4,6302799112,John Cassavetes is one of the great directors and this is one of my favorites with good gritty acting by Gena Rowlands and candid urban scenes.,1225324800,,143,4.538461538461538
513157,4,6302799112,"This movie is worth watching for the pure joy of watching Gena Rowlands kicking butt and taking names. The movie starts out strong. The mafia closes in around a family who live down the hall from Gloria. The father works for the mafia but has been disclosing information to the FBI. As men with guns appear outside their apartment building and the family desperately realizes they are doomed, the mother convinces Gloria to take her son into her apartment so that he can be saved. The family is killed, and Gloria is left with a belligerent 6 year old she doesn't know what to do with. To complicate matters, she was working for the same people who killed the family, so by keeping the son alive, she jeopardizes her own life.

As she tries to decide what to do, the child rants and raves like an adult, proudly declaring ""I am a man! I am a man! You can't tell me what to do"" and angrily demanding to be returned to his father. Gloria considers leaving him to the mob, but then changes her mind when a car of hoodlums shows up to take him. She starts dragging him all over the city trying to find a plan of escape, and eventually she decides she loves the child.

Here's where the plot grows thin. Gloria's lines are natural, strong, effortless, but the child's voice oscillates between that of an actual child (but not one who cries or feels sad for his parents), that of an adult (but with a bizarre Street Car Named Desire machismo), and sometimes, that of some sort of narrator. His character didn't ring true, and so the maternal love story between him and Gloria doesn't end up feeling real. Despite this, Gena Rowlands is able to carry the movie.

At the end of the movie is a strikingly cheesy slow motion running-to-safety scene. A slow motion running scene from Cassavettes, founding father of American independent cinema? I can only hope to blame the cultural void that was the 1980s for that error of judgement.",1193961600,,1924,4.522988505747127
513158,5,6302799112,"Who knew Cassavette's could make an action film, and a funny one at that? I love ""Minnie and Moskowitz."" I admire ""A Woman Under the Influence,' and I weep over ""A Child Is Waiting."" But ""Gloria"" is still the best work Rowlands and Cassevettes did together. In my formative years, only five women got to pack heat: Pam Grier, Charlie's Angels and Angie Dickenson (ah ""Police Woman"" ...the memories). Then came ""Gloria"" in 1980. Critics at the time nicknamed this film ""Dirty Harriet"" for the multiple stadoffs at gun point. Roger Egbert in his year-in-review said this film gave him the single biggest laugh of any movie that year. Rowlands tears up the screen and takes no prisoners. She is off-set all through by a great wide-eyed performance from child actor John Adames--where is he now?

I could quote this film all day long: ""Got a million bucks and this slow elevator."" ""Move it, you double-crossing little rat. Move it!"" The opeinging credits feature a series of paintings done in child fashion by the great African-American painter Romare Beardon. The score features an orchestra, Spanish guitar and a Jewish cantor gets thrown into the mix. The film is a multi-ethnic valentine to New York City circa 1980. Watch for the moving tracking/crane shot that follows Gloria and Phil through the bus station depot, up an escalator and out into the street. Easily done today, it was a technical marvel in 1980.

God bless Sharon Stone's misguided attempt to remake this film: She was too young and pretty to make it work as a comedy.",1175990400,4,1535,4.8106060606060606
513159,5,6302799112,"Gloria remains one of director John Cassavetes most accessable films. It is also his most commercially successful, being one of 1980's biggest hits at the Box Office.
Cassavates cast his wife, Gena Rowlands in the title role of a former Mafiosa Moll trying to get on with a life, in a post Mob existence. This, however, is turned upside down when she finds herself with a six year old boy whose family has just been wiped out by the very Mob with whom she used to consort. Realising the magnitude of the situation, she cynically first of all tries to get rid of the lad but later forms a maternal bond with him. Both go on the run together from the Mob, in a desperate struggle to survive and flee the city. Before long, the Mob have despatched their hitmen. However, and unfortunately for the Mob, Gloria definitely ain't a lady for the burning, and instead is a very tough individual who uses her streetwise knowledge and considerable skill with a firearm to terrible effect. Soon a trail of Mob bodies begins to pile up as various gangsters lethally underestimate Gloria, in their attempts to snatch the boy....
Rowlands is simply superb in the role, and at times strides across the screen like a female Bogart. Her wardrobe complements this, and the overall effect is that of a tigress protecting its young. This is underlined by one scene where she guns down a hitman and retrieving his pistol, snarls contemptuously ""Huh, he had to use a Magnum on me!""

The music by Bill Conti is superb and sax riffs have seldom sounded so good as in this film. Ultimately this is a bleak film to watch, colour is very subdued and the atmosphere is raw and gritty. The ending is very ambiguous and Cassavates has pretty much left it up to the viewer to interpret what is actually happening.
This is a truly great film though and I recommend it unreservedly.",1167436800,5,1848,4.5830815709969785

513162,2,6302799112,"Admission: although I grew up on old movies, and try very hard to see a constant variety of film from the earliest days to the present, I've never seen a lot of the great '70s classics. So recently, I've had to very consciously make myself see some of these pictures, in an attempt to finally recognize that period of cinema for what it was, as opposed to what I merely believe it to be. Having just read Peter Bogdanovich's book of portraits and conversations, ""Who the Hell's In It,"" I figured it was time for a go at a film by his friend, John Cassavetes.

Bogdanovich went to some length to praise ""Gloria,"" and it sounded a little unusual, so I went with that one. To be honest, I was left with a number of negative feelings: too long-winded, too dry, not visually interesting enough. This is a very typical, simple thriller, with a hook that's been done before, and it's presented in a very obvious manner. The only times I came away with the sense of something 'more' were in some of the longer conversations.

The setup isn't much: man rats on the mob, the mob decide to kill him and his family, the family manages to leave their youngest child with a next door neighbor, the next door neighbor happens to be a former mob girl. What follows is the somewhat expected string of scenes with the older, grouchy woman leading a six-year-old boy around New York, running from modern-day gangsters, and calling everyone ""punk"" or ""stupid"" or ""wise guy,"" and generally acting like a taller James Cagney with boobs. The kid gets a few witty, precocious lines, and it might've been cute at 30 minutes. At just over two hours it drags endlessly along, and though you get the sense the kid really cares for the woman, the woman never seems to care for the kid until the final reel where they're inevitably reunited in an unrealistically (and unsatisfyingly) happy ending. That meant I really didn't care about the woman, either, and it's pretty hard to follow a movie where the protagonist is as hard and unbending as a rock.

They remade this film in 1999 with Sharon Stone, and I'm reliably informed it was pretty ridiculous. I might've liked that more; ridiculous can be a lot of fun, with the right mood and the right crowd. Boring and obvious are just that - a waste of my time.",1127347200,5,2279,4.526699029126213

513175,4,6302799112,"This is an Oscar-caliber performance by Gena Rowlands. This woman takes no stuff and takes on the mob when they are after a disk that a little boy is in possession of. Having already wiped out the kids family (Because his accountant father ripped them off), they don't just want the disk they want the kid, who was in the house during the massacre, silenced.

I think that perhaps the flick ""The PRofessional,"" ripped off the plot of this movie, replacing the young boy with a little girl. At any rate, let's not digress: the young Puerto Rican child John Adames cannot act a lick. He's precocious and cute, but he has a head the size of Soldier Field.

Here are some tidbits to chew on: the accountant is a white man married to a gorgeous Latina. They have a beautiful teenaged daugther and a younger one, all who get wiped out. As the bad guys converge on the apartment they live in, this man singles out the little boy and gives him the disk. He tells the little boy to ""always be a man"" and then sends the kid off while he and the rest of the family get butchered. What was that all about? Why didn't they have a phone in the house? Why didn't they try to escape to the crowded streets below as a unit?

Not only that, but when Gloria and the kid are on the run, she is wondering why she doesn't just dump the kid. The young boy is falling in love with her because he's seen her shoot five or six guys defending HIM. They move from being two people who cannot stand one another to mother and son. Although the the kid has the acting skills of a giant mouse on crack, Gena Rowlands more than compensates with streetwise toughness, gentle compassion when need be, and an undying commitment to keeping this young kid alive.

I catch it whenever it's on television.  I must have seen it at least 50 times!  I never tire of the non-stop action and the gritty realistic portrayal by Gena Rolands.

Gena Rowlands, of course, is so wonderful and captivating that one wants to watch over, more than once. It lends to the harsh part of life and comes out with you sitting on the edge of your seat, not knowing where these two will end. I really cannot tell you enough.

The kid is obviously worth her efforts, with his curls and tough guy, wanna-be-lover-boy-at-6 stance, and their interaction is odd and touching. I love the realistic way the film was shot by Mr. Cassavettes and I like the feeling of movement as the characters flee from one location to the next trying to outrun the mob. Character behavior makes sense given the plot. Probably my all time favorite woman hero film story. Enjoy",1029196800,7,623,4.522123893805309
513179,5,6302799112,"She is tough. She is beautiful. She is glorious. She is Gloria -- ie she is Gena Rowlands. And I really admire her. I think she, along with Ellen Burstin, is one of the most beautiful and talented American actress who is in the business for such a long time and  has done wonderful works.  To my complete delight these two ladies worked togheter in ""Playing by Heart"" -- which is a nice movie.
""Gloria"" is directed by Gena's late husband, the also very talented John Cassavetes. The story is simple but touching: one boy, Phill, has his family murdered by gangsters. Gloria, who is a neighbour has taken the boy from the apartement before the crime happened. So she and the little boy spend most of the film trying not to get killed by these mobsters. To make things worse, Phill has got a black book given by his dad in which he had written everthing he knew about the mafia when he worked for them as an accountant;  plus, Gloria herself is an ex-con, who had had some reltionships with these very same guys.
This film is very violent and bloody, but on the other hand, it is very human. The relationship between Gloria and Phill grows up slowly -- once she doesn't like children very much -- ; and it is very believable. Gena is hard as a rock  -- as Gloria would be if she were a real person. She received an Oscar nomination for this, which is one of her finest work. And it kept me wondering what things Gloria had  faced that made her like this.  The boy is also good and he is the light point of the movie; the comments he makes are so innocent that  they sound funny.
The score is competely amazing and unforgettable, and goes very well with all scenes. And the opening credits written on some paitings is breathtaking. Cassavete's direstion is precise and the script is smart and serious.
I think the only small problem in this movie is that is very dated and nowadays it looks a bit old. I'm not talking about the fashion, but some situations. But on the other hand, there's an up-dated version of ""Gloria"" starred by Sharon Stone, which is really, really awful. So I'd rather watching the ""old"" one -- even with some 'old' things -- than that modernized one. That's why I highly recommend this picture!",1010016000,17,2214,4.425061425061425
513180,5,6302799112,"Never sentimental, often brutal, ""Gloria"" follows the life and times of ex-gangster's moll Gloria who finds herself protecting the young survivor of a mafia massacre.  Armed with only her wits and a pocket gun, Gloria goes on the run, taking with her Phil, played wonderfully by then child actor John Adames who tries his best to be Gloria's equal in everything.  Gloria knows enough about mafia life to know that she and Phil are living on borrowed time but she's one tough broad, and there's a chance that the Mafia just might have met their match in a woman whose maternal instincts have been aroused, and who will do anything to protect a child she has come to love as her own.  Gena Rowlands is crackingly good as the foul mouthed Gloria who gives as good as she gets, as she takes on the mob, and the whole corrupt city system in a battle of wits, blood and bullets.  Considering that this film was made over 20 years ago, it has aged pretty well and is just as watchable now as it was then.

513183,4,6302799112,"Seldom has there been a director who possesses the uncanny ability to drop his audience in the middle of the action and manage to make that audience forget that it is watching a movie.  John Cassavetes manages to accomplish  that feat within the first five minutes of his mostly overlooked and  unfairly maligned ""Gloria.""  Following the offbeat opening  credits accompanied by eerie Spanish guitar music, we  find ourselves in  the stuffy Bronx apartment of a mob accountant (Buch Henry) and his Puerto  Rican family.  As we soon come to learn, our friend, while in the employ of  the mob, has been actively engaged in the practice of ""skimming off  the top.""  Furthermore, he is in possession of a book in which he has,  over the past several years, compiled numerous illegal transactions and  other assorted niceties in which his recent employers have been involved.  When we meet our accountant, he is in a panic, as he is well aware that his  employers know full well what he has been up to and that they are waiting  in the lobby of his apartment building to eradicate his family and to  recover the damning book.  It is at this time that we are introduced  to our heroine, Gloria (Gena Rowlands.)  It is also at this time that we  realize that we are in for a cinematic gem.  Her entrance is flawless  because of its nondeliberate inappropriateness (""Ran out of  coffee"").  A line that is classic yet easy to overlook (and for the  most part, unfortunately, has been.)  It is at this moment that  Gloria learns of her new role in life:  Guardian of the accountant's  eight-year-old son.  It is also at this moment that she is given an  opportunity to deliver another gem:  ""I don't like kids; especially  yours.""  Within hours, Gloria finds herself as the sole protector of  world-weary boy and running from the same mobsters with whom she has been  acquainted and intimate for many years.  Cassavetes presents  ""Gloria"" with a gritty, down-in-the-dirt honesty and an, at  times, unneven narrative that can easily be mistaken for sloppy filmmaking.  Do not be fooled.  The finished product as we see it is exactly as our  director intended it.  Cassavetes strikes a successful balance by combining  the hard-hitting honesty of everyday life (his trademark) with a story of  the growing affection between a single, nonmaternal, completely independent  middle-aged woman and a newly orphaned eight-year-old boy who has  experienced more suffering and loss in his youth than most of us will in  our entire lifetime.  ""Gloria,"" as most of the films of  Cassavetes, has been widely dismissed by critics as mediocre and  forgettable (misinformed misanthropes as they are).  Do not be steered away  from it because of what you may have heard.  Give it a chance, and you will  not be disappointed.",920419200,12,2796,4.854700854700854

Gloria is gritty and street-smart. The plot is gonna catch you from the beginning. Lastly the ending is tear jerking.

I loved this movie almost 40 years ago amd watched it today with the same intensity and admiration.

7831295,5,6302799112,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Gena Rowlands was one of the best actresses of her time. Married to John Cassavetes, who also directed this near-masterpiece, she was able to get prime roles that might have gone to others had she not had the connection. Here, she's Gloria, a holed-up, taken-care-of, mobster moll who goes on the run with an orphaned kid from the neighborhood. Some of the story is hokey, but it's worth it to see Rowlands brandish her revolver in the face of punks on the subway and sneer, ""You let a woman beat ya, huh! You tiny nothin!""

Trust me when I say if it weren't for Gloria, there'd have been no Leon: The Professional.",1521072000,,659,4.401639344262295
