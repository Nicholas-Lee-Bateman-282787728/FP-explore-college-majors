8367687,4,B002EEY8QC,"This was a good action movie--it just seemed to drag in spots...I won't spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it, but if you like an involved plot with some interesting characters--this is your movie. You've got several storylines going on in it, but the most interesting one to me, was in the end.  I won't even mention it...Just get it and watch it.",1257552000,,355,4.461538461538462
