After watching the rest: Spectacular! They have been vastly improved. The Colors are full and crisp. The details are vivid. The sound doesn't seem too much better (but I use hearing aids!).

6413041,5,B00KB61584,"I have been waiting for this since the Poirot's were re-mastered in HD from the original 16mm film elements.
Even thought these were filmed in 16mm (the BBC standard) they will still be a great improvement over the old washed out standard definition film transfers from the early 1990's.

The episodes have been completely remastered to high definition quality from the original film elements by BBC Studios and Post Production's Digital Media Services team.

Regarded by many fans as the definitive Miss Marple, Joan Hickson was one of the oldest actresses to take a lead role in a major television series when she was cast as Agatha Christie's soft-spoken, sharp-eared sleuth at the age of 78 in 1984. She retired eight years later, having completed 12 mysteries in the Miss Marple series - four of which are collected in this volume.

These are in their original BBC versions, which varied greatly in their broadcast. Some as one episode, others split into multiple episodes.

Bonus Feature:
""A Very British Murder, Part 1,"" - 50:00 - the first episode of a three-part series documenting the British national obsession with murder mysteries.

They all have full credits for each episode. There is a ""Play All"" button for each disc, but this it to play both mysteries on the disc, not the individual mystery. However this still plays each title & credit section. You can skip the end credits by pressing the ""Next"" button on your remote, but you still have to sit through the opening titles of the next episode, there is no way to skip those without missing story.
It would have been nice of the BBC to offer a ""Play All"" feature for each mystery that would eliminate the in-between titles & credits, Blu-ray & DVD can do this.

These four stories were shot entirely on location and feature appearances by A-List British actors including BAFTA Winner Cheryl Campbell, Samantha Bond and Ralph Michael.
Those used to the new fast-paced ""Marple"" 90 minute episodes may find these 155 minute episodes a bit slow.  But these longer stories flush out the characters and mystery much better.  The new ""Marple"" stories often change what characters do to help compress the stories to 90 minutes.  There is no 'flash' to this older series (fancy optical transitions to help move the story along quickly), just the best dramatizations of the Miss Marple stories.
So sit back and enjoy an evening with Miss Marple, but allow yourself up to 3 hours for one mystery.

These adaptations of Agathas Christies deliciously entertaining mystery novels are just that; finely adapted from the original stories. In addition, they are exquisitely well handled by Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. Each story, moreover, has been completely remastered so that they look much better, as well.

Of course, one can be fans of the talents of Geraldine McEwan (and/or Julia McKenzie), but should you watch versions of these stories featuring Geraldine McEwan you will be treated to---just to mention a few inventions--a flashback of an affair of Miss Marples with a married man in Murder in the Vicarage, the surprise of a different murderer in the Body in the Library and lesbian issues in both that adaptation as well in A Murder is Announced.

6413064,4,B00KB61584,"I bought all three series for my wife, who is a huge fan of the originals.  Having watched a few on Blu-ray, I think they are very good, with a couple ""cons.""  This is the definitive Marple in our family's opinion, though we still like the more recent modernized ones.

First, they look great in terms of grain, sharpness and color.  A huge improvement over the DVD versions we own.  You will constantly be noticing details that escaped you on previous viewings.  There also seem to be some small additional scenes included in these that were not in the as-broadcast PBS versions.  The picture does not naturally lend itself to the big screen wide screen set.  You either have to zoom in (missing sometimes important parts of the frame) or else live with bars on the ends.  We first settled on zoomed in, and sometimes as when a car drives from left to right at the bottom of the screen, you can't see all of it.  And tops of heads are cut off.  So I think we're going to try the bars again.  Since it wasn't filmed in wide screen originally, this is what it is.  Just don't be surprised by it.

What was surprising to us looking at these on a large (70"") screen was how often focus was off.  Person who is talking a little fuzzy, the back of the chair they are sitting in is razor sharp.  This happens often in some episodes and is distracting.  Some of the close ups of faces are just plain out of focus.  I am sure nobody noticed this on a TV set during the original run but in a decent home theater it is quite apparent.  And another thing these Blu rays can't fix from the source material.

So all in all, we like them.  They are a big step up in picture quality, but not audio quality, from the DVDs.

The sounds is a bit primitive.  Enhanced details like footsteps and other background noises but in general it sounds like compressed mono.  My received shows it as mono.  Dialogue can be faint at times, better at others.",1461456000,,1928,4.318435754189944

6413088,5,B00KB61584,"I have to confess that it took me awhile to warm up to Joan Hickson's Miss Marple. What I initially mistook for a sort of frosty, disdainful detachment, though, is actually a very period appropriate and beautifully subtle rendering of Agatha Christie's iconic character---and one one who's a true heroine of mine. Joan Hickson's Miss Marple, like the episodes overall, are impressively loyal to Agatha Christie's vision (much more so than the newer Marple episodes, though those have a different sort of charm!) Thankfully, however, they're not so slavishly, dully intent on copying the books to the point where there's nothing original about the characters, dialogue and settings. New viewers should know that these are more toned down than the comparatively ""innovative"", modern and even borderline edgy (by Marple standards!) adaptations that came later, many of which deviate pretty sharply from Christie's original work. It's therefore easy to dismiss these earlier Marple movies as dry and flat, but like Agatha Christie's wonderful novels, there's actually a ton of insight, wit, and even splashes of very real emotional depth lurking just beneath the surface. I find that while these are less splashy than the newest Marples, they have a substance that sneaks up on you and resonates more deeply. Perhaps most importantly, they're just so purely enjoyable and entertaining that it's worth watching them over and over despite knowing by then 'whodunit'! As is typical of these British mystery series, the casting ranges from very good to downright phenomenal, and the writing is wonderfully sharp.

I'm pretty oblivious when it comes to the look of TV and movies and often can't even tell a remaster from a rougher original, but in this case the films really do look so much better that even *I* noticed the difference! It just makes this series even more pleasurable to watch, particularly when they treat us to shots of the English countryside and picturesque villages.

No wonder once the Dame Agatha Chrystie predicted the actress that will play her character. Her prediction was accurate, for more than forty years, Joan Hickson started acting in the detective series, in the role of miss Marple. So, at first glance, it seems that we see on the screen of an ordinary old woman, who lives in the village. She always carefully and she is neatly dressed. She loves order and notice many things.

6413142,5,B00KB61584,"Many fine actresses have filled the creaking little cheap shoes of Miss Jane Marple, such as Angela Lansbury, Helen Hayes and Margaret Rutherford. (Christie disliked Rutherford in particular as her Jane.) Overall, Christie was never happy with most screen adaptions of her books, with the exception of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". If she had lived 8 more years, she might have seen Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. Apparently when a young Hickson was in the cast of an Agatha Christie play in the 1940's which Christie attended, she is said to have written to Hickson that someday she might like to see her play Marple. The prophecy was fulfilled 50 years later. There is no one who ever filled the little shoes and drab garb of Miss Marple as well as Joan Hickson. Hickson captured both the nosiness of Marple but also her kindness. If you were the suspect of a crime, you might seek out Marple as played by Hickson to help.

The new Blu-ray editions of Hickson's Marple are superb! The colours are brighter and deeper, and most of the shots are much cleaner than the drab DVD versions. Also, the soundtrack, both the music, dialog, and sound effects, are far richer sounding than the original DVD editions. (I am not sure, but I suspect the original series was recorded in mono.) A few spots where there is slight graininess is apparent, especially in shots with dark parts of the screen, but very minimal. Overall, the engineers who created these new Blu-ray editions have succeeded in bringing Hickson/Marple to a quality near high definition standards. Unfortunately, neither Christie nor Hickson are with us anymore, but I think both would approve of these new editions.",1421712000,7,1675,4.83623693379791

I have the older DVD versions; one from BBC and two from A&E. As I recall, the one from the BBC has pretty good video quality; the ones from A&E have terrible video quality.

The BBC release has: ""The Body in the Library"", ""A Murder is Announced"", and ""A Pocketful of Rye""
A&E Set 1 has: ""Sleeping Murder"", ""A Caribbean Mystery"", ""The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side"", ""4:50 From Paddington""
A&E Set 2 has: ""At Bertram's Hotel"", ""Nemesis"", ""Murder at the Vicarage"", ""They Do it with Mirrors"", ""The Moving Finger""

However.

This release contains: ""The Murder at the Vicarage"" (on A&E #2), ""The Moving Finger"" (on A&E #2), ""The Body in the Library"" (on BBC release), and ""A Murder is Announced"" (on BBC release).  It appears that the new releases are doing the stories in the order they were written, which is great, but makes it hard for holders of the old disks.  If I purchase the first Blu-ray, I cannot get rid of any of my existing disks.

I'm quite prepared to replace my entire Joan Hickson DVD with Blu-ray discs; but I want to be sure that they will ALL be available.  At that time, this will get five stars.

If you have never seen Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, then this is a great start to your collection, and highly recommended, especially now that the stories are in the proper order.

Update (30 Jan 2015): Disk 2 is now scheduled for release with four more; ""They Do it with Mirrors"" (A&E#2) ""A Pocketful of Rye"" (BBC release), ""4:50 From Paddington"" (A&E#1), and ""The Moving Finger (A&E#2)"".  I cannot wait for the final release to see the re-mastered series!

6413146,5,B00KB61584,"We've owned many iterations of the Joan Hickson Miss Marple series (VHS, DVD and now Blu Ray), so we were delighted to hear of the newly restored Blu Ray release.

First the stories:
The Joan Hickson versions of Miss Marple reflect a more genteel time. A time where the pace of life was slower and people acted with more respect and consideration toward others. (Except for the odd murder...) At first glance these stories may seem dull and boring when compared to the pacing of current movies. But on further viewings one starts to see how varied and engaging the characters are. Agatha Christie wrote murder mysteries that revolved around the psychological side of crime, not explosions, car chases and nudity. Thankfully, these movies leave something to the imagination and are mostly faithful to the books that they are based on, unlike the more recent Miss Marple efforts.

The restoration:
The restoration of theses movies was beautifully done. They lack the ""pop"" in color that a more recent movie may have but I feel that the softer hue that these Blu Rays have is perfectly fitting for the time period they represent. While watching these we couldn't help but be amazed by all the things that the restored Blu Rays revealed that we couldn't see in our DVD set. (Color and patterns of clothing and upholstery)

6413154,5,B00KB61584,"My earlier DVD's of Joan Hickson as Miss Marple date from 2000. This 2014 remastering is AMAZING. Colors are beautiful and details are crisp. I am a happy camper, because I love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple and now her shows are top-flight viewing. Or, at any rate, 4 of her shows are. This is Volume 1, so the other 8 shows are to follow.

This 2014 Volume 1 has 3 DVD discs or 2 BluRay discs, presented in the original 4:3 aspect ratio. Sound is still mono, but it has been cleaned up. English subtitles are available. You get over 8 hours of extraordinary Agatha Christie mysteries, which originally aired from 1984 - 1992.

You also get another 50 minutes of a Bonus Feature which I enjoyed. It's on the last disc, titled, ""A Very British Murder - Part One: The New Taste For Blood"" (2013). This British mini-series originally aired in 3 parts, so it is probable that the other 2 parts will be included in future volumes. Dr. Lucy Worsley hosts the show, taking us to locations and museums. Part One tells how real-life murders became an entertainment industry, thanks to the population's growing literacy and cheap printing allowing the sale of thousands of one-page broadsides. Worsley is joined by Rosalind Crone, Lecturer in History, Open University, and Michael Kirk, actor and theatre director.

In 1810, there were only 15 convictions for murder in all of Britain. That's why the December 1811 slaughter of a young family in their Docklands, London, home became a national sensation. People lined up to tour the house where the murder took place even while the bodies were laid out.

From there, Worsley takes us to 1827 and the Red Barn Murder. This murder truly turned into popular entertainment, as hit songs were composed and melodramas were staged. Here we see the start of the Murder Industry, and some of the collectibles she shows you are grotesque.

The 3rd murder showcased is the 1849 Bermanzee Horror. This is notable because it's the first big crime solved by the new Detective Branch of the Met. Police officers dedicated to solving crimes - a whole new emphasis and, as Worsley promises for the next episode, ""a new chapter in the history of murder"".

Episode 1 ""Murder at the Vicarage"" (97 minutes without commercials) By the time Colonel Lucius Protheroe is found dead at the Vicar's desk, you'll have a yard-long list of suspects; he was an unlikable man. Detective Inspector Slack is on the job, and he's met Miss Marple before (in ""The Body in the Library""). This leads him to gripe, ""I thought it was looking too good to be true. I should have known better. Soon as I saw that nice little gray-haired cobra sliding about, I should have known better.... Sticks to this sort of business like chewing gum to the cat.""

Episode 2 ""The Moving Finger"" (96 minutes, in 2 parts) City-dwellers Jerry Burton and his sister Joanna, rent ""The Furze"", a charming cottage in the village of Lymston, while he's recovering from injuries from an air crash. The Burtons are quite the sensation in this tight-knit community, but that doesn't save them from receiving vile poison pen letters. It turns out others have received them. Fortunately, Miss Marple is visiting her friend, Maude, who asks her to investigate: ""It's not in your league, Dear, I know. No dead bodies. No gun shots. No blunt instruments. Not even a shadow of Scotland Yard. Just a lot of unhappy people I know you can help."" Of course, she spoke too soon about ""no dead bodies"".
One reason these episodes are wonderful is the characterizations. Take the very beginning of the episode. In just a few minutes of conversation, we have a complete idea of Miss Barton's personality. It's great writing.

Episode 3 ""The Body in the Library"" (124 minutes in 3 parts) Dolly Bantry and her husband are more than startled to awake one morning to find the body of a girl lying on their library carpet. Before the police even get there, Dolly is on the phone to her great friend, Jane Marple: ""My dear, we've just found a body in our library. I'm coming down to fetch you so you can see it before Constable Palk gets here.""
I find this episode special for a couple reasons. One is Dolly's absolute confidence in Jane. Secondly, the horrid effect of gossip on Colonel Bantry is well drawn.

Episode 4 ""A Murder is Announced"" (159 minutes in 3 parts) Near the ocean, the residents of tiny Chipping Cleghorn are delighted to see this in the Gazette's personals column: ""A Murder Is Announced, and will take place on Friday October the 5th at Little Paddocks at 7 pm. Friends, please accept this as the only intimation.""
Just before 7, a bunch of friends congregate in Miss Blacklock's drawing room, agog for the fun of a mystery murder game. The trouble is, she doesn't know any more about that ad than they do. This makes it rather astounding when someone is actually killed. Fortunately, Miss Marple is taking an ocean-side vacation, courtesy of her nephew Raymond. Only she can plumb the desperation which went into this killing. And the next.
This is a wonderful episode with great plotting.

The original British version, titled ""A Very British Murder: The Story of a National Obsession"", is available on amazon, as well as the American version, with a slightly different name:

I received my copy of the Blu-ray and, while I have only watched one of the four stories (due to time), I did watch the bonus feature all the way through. Im leave it up to others to discuss the stories and the acting and concentrate on two things: The quality of the transfers and that bonus feature.

I never saw the original series nor any prior DVD version of the series but I have to say that the sharpness and color in the episode that I watch was truly beautiful. Sharp lines and bright colors. The only thing that reminded me that this was a series produced in the 1980s was that the screen aspect ratio is 4:3 so you will have black bars on your flat screen TV. The sound is great as well. (And  yes, there is an English subtitles option)

The Bonus is part 1 of a three part program that the BBC Four aired in 2013  A Very British Murder . (The remaining two parts should be on the next two volumes.).  The first part runs 50 minutes and is hosted by Dr. Lucy Worsley . As she describes on her website  Im Lucy Worsley, by day Chief Curator at Historic Royal Palaces, and by night a writer of history books.  She has also written a companion book to the series.  The subject of this first far is a brief history of real murders in London in the 19th century, going back to 1811.  As Worsley describes the murders, she recreates them by visiting locations and sometimes dressing up as the female character. She explains that the British public found a fascination in the trials and that some were turned in to plays and later well-known cases Murder in the Red Barn were told and retold in ballads that were, not only sung, but sold (like sheet music.  The only time an author is mentioned in this episode that Charles Dickens used the Red Barn characters in his novel Bleak House.  Worsley does interview a few archivists but its mostly her on screen. Its a quirky documentary and I personally found her annoying but this is subjective. Im looking forward to the next two parts as we move into the early 20th century and books and films that explain further the British love for crime fiction.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

The one thing I didn't really care for was the way the stories were divided. I knowthat the discs are following the way they were initially broadcast, but I would have liked the story to be ne complete story, instead of Part , Part 2.

The high definition restoration on Miss Marple is nothing short of a digital miracle. The colors brightened to such an extent, I found myself remembering dull and drab locations and people practically dressed in burlap sacks as compared to what they were wearing, sitting on, walking past. Nothing is unnatural, not too bright, not neon, certainly not overly contrasted, but precisely what you would expect in terms of the coloring on objects, locations and people, if this were filmed today without any strange lenses or lights. It appears wholly natural, real, and beautiful. I didn't expect such a high quality presentation. To add to that, the clarity is excellent, film grain was satisfactory to me, and I am never pleased with grain, and the aspect ratio is maintained. The only picture issue is the standard one for UK shows released on Blu-ray in America: this should be faster, by 4%, showing in the original PAL compatible speed at 1080i and, as a consequence of the films running slightly slower, because they were slowed down during conversion, the dialog seems a bit slow, to me and the films drag ever so slightly. Still, this is a beautiful set for video/picture quality and will not be beat.

For sound, the audio appears to me very well preserved. I did not notice significant flaws. Voices were clear and consistent and the music was as fun as ever.

I hope you find what you are looking for. As for this one, I absolutely recommend it for anyone who loves Marple and very strongly advise getting this one if you love a love of quaint English villages and murder mysteries.",1503100800,4,1661,4.780487804878049
