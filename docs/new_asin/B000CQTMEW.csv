8100799,3,B000CQTMEW,"A fair travel guide of the Czech Republic for someone who plans to be a first time visitor. As a former resident of the country for over 20 years, and frequent traveler to the country during the post Iron Curtain years, I was somewhat disappointed in the disproportionate time devoted to some sections of the country to the exclusion of numerous other worthwhile sites completely missed. As an example, too much time was devoted to the coverage of Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad). Less emphasis on that part would have allowed coverage of more historically important sites. So, in that sense, I tend to be more critical and feel the travel video fell short of its potential...",1322179200,3,668,4.817391304347826
8100800,1,B000CQTMEW,A waste of money and time. The credits were more entertaining than the movie. The movie was such a bore it made me snore. It is a waste of the five seconds it took us to figure out how boring it is.,1307059200,,198,3.738095238095238
8100801,5,B000CQTMEW,"My wife and I watched this DVD a few weeks before going on a vacation that would take us into the Czech Republic.  The DVD was a great preview of our vacation, and is now a great rembrance if it. If you're thinking of going to the Czech Republic, I recommend this DVD.  The production values are not the highest, but then again, this is an informal travelogue, not a major motion picture.  Several languages (including English) can be selected.",1225584000,,444,4.525
