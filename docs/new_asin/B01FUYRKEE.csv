7751896,5,B01FUYRKEE,"Had not seen this movie in years. I remembered snippets of it; who could forget that glorious theme music..

Well, after seeing it again, I must say it has stood the test of time. It is perfectly cast - I don't think anyone else but Jane Seymour could've played the role of Elise McKenna. It was also nice to see Christopher Reeve in a role other than Superman.

I should add that if you liked the movie, you may want to pick up the book by Richard Matheson. It is well-written and I love how he thought of all those ""little details"".",1519776000,3,534,4.2254901960784315
