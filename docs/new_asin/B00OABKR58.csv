8682926,5,B00OABKR58,"Nat Hentoff is an icon in the world of jazz journalists. He has probably written more liner notes for jazz albums than anyone else and was not only a jazz columnist for Downbeat but was a regular contributor to the Village Voice.

I had the chance to hear and meet Hentoff at the International Jazz Educator's Conference about five years ago. I asked him for his email address as he wanted me to contact him. He replied""I don't use email; pick up the phone and call me. I'm listed in the phone book."". That's the kind of guy Hentoff is. He still composes on a typewriter (remember those), not a PC.

Hentoff not only wrote about jazz but he used his Village Voice for social and political criticism. We hear from the head of the Anti-Defamation League (which gave him their annual award) and the former editor of the Voice. Playwright Leroi Jones, critic Stanley Crouch and Dan Morgenstern (retired head of the Rutgers Jazz Archives - who has probably penned as many liner notes as Hentoff) are interviewed. And so is his sister and his second (and current) wife.

There's a section on Bob Dylan with Nat talking about an article he wrote for The New Yorker as well as an interview with Dylan that he did for Playboy. There's another section on Lenny Bruce with a great Bruce clip.

This 86 minute film is narrated by Andre Brauger , and the DVD has a few bonus features but they are brief.  Two last under a minute, while the World War II (deleted scene is 2  minutes and his comments on his time at the New Yorker are just over 4 minutes.

This is another fine release in the JAZZ documentary series from First Run Features and a must see for any jazz fan.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
