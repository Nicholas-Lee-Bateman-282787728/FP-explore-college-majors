8511596,1,B0077AYMRI,"This video goes from one mountain to the other, over and over again, and they actually start to blur.  Really, I thought there might be some talk about a nearby village, but that happens only ONCE in a two disc video.  Sometimes informative geological information is given or some historical information, but it's really threadbare or vague.  I tried to get through disc 2, but my partner started snoring next to me on the couch, so I, too, admitted to myself that this video was so boring.  I don't know how they made it without falling asleep themselves.",1477353600,,556,4.642857142857143

8511599,3,B0077AYMRI,"This video was ok. I was expecting a little more, but having recently returned from a trip to Scotland, it had great video and imagery. Not a great deal of content though.",1446336000,,171,4.375
8511600,2,B0077AYMRI,"Beautiful video with boring design and arrangement

No Caption, little visual add on the information related, only endless video.
The voiceover keeps on and on with the beautiful video taken from helicopter being played
However, the video is just played and it's taken with a distance always far from most creatures.
I have read a lot about Scotland out of interest, but I felt bored after watching this DVD for 2 minutes.
You didn't miss a thing if you passed this one.",1370044800,2,470,4.7317073170731705
8511601,3,B0077AYMRI,"This is a 2 disc set that plays for 150 minutes. There are no extras.  It is always disappointing when DVDs feel they do not have to have subtitles there are none here.  This is narrated by Fiona MacKinnon. The episodes are; Trossachs to Rannoch Moor, Nevis and Glencoe, The Grampians, Torridon and the Far North, Skye and Kintail, Best of the Mountains of Scotland.

Most of the film is shot from helicopters, with almost dizzying effect. One longs to touch the ground every once in a while and look up to the mountains rather than always down. Even the villages are seen from above. There are small maps shown which are almost useless unless you are very familiar with the area.
We are told the mountains are particularly handsome in the winter, but with a few exceptions of shots of skiers we are never shown the winter wonderland. We are told of the many people that climb these mountains, but again for the most part the hills, trails and roads are vacant. I remember seeing a film of the Alps where hikers joyfully waved to the helicopter and scenes were shown from the highways and railways, it added much to the pleasure these scenes give to everyone.

As much as I love Scotland and its mountains this begins to wear one's interest as you go through the episodes.",1345766400,5,1272,4.541484716157205
