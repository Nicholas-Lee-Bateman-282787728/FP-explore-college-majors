8374382,3,B002MZZTRU,"Hard to find film.  Yet another take on the Bathory legend, perhaps a little more faithful than some adaptations.  Julie Delphy's and a recent Hungarian adaptation were closer to the account.  The streamed version of this called for digital remastering, as the print quality wasn't great.  But it was OK.  Just glad that it was available",1359936000,2,337,4.946428571428571
