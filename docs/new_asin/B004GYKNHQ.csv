8429094,3,B004GYKNHQ,"An aimless story in a B-movie populated by insignificant events, the occasional exploding head, and some gory tentacle attacks.

Honestly, Id struggle to offer an informative plot synopsis other than some spelunkers are attacked by ridiculous cave monsters with confusing biology. This films story was completely incoherent and random like so much other Italian horror. IMDB offers a bit more: A spaceship lands back on Earth after a failed mission, but the astronauts have been replaced by hideous creatures that can penetrate people's bodies and make them explode. A group of cave explorers are attacked by the monsters inside an underground cave, but the survivors are in for a surprise when they finally manage to escape the trap... Given the title Alien 2, it seems to imply that this all soooort of occurs after the events of Alien (1979)which is the part 1 predecessor of this film.

This film suffers from boring pacing for the first hour, but finds its more entertaining footing once the gore and creature is introduced. When we first meet our monster its in the form of a blue something-or-other and it apparently gorily removed a childs facewe don't see how this happens. It struck me as a pulsating blue rock that eats faces at this point.

Written and directed by Ciro Ippolito (as Sam Cromwell), this B-movies best attribute is its cavern sets. Despite idiotic dialogue and exposition, our characters wander a truly awesome subterranean scape which our alien monster made its lair. And what, again, is this monster? Well, as the film progresses we slowly learn more about this alien aberration, although we understand with no greater clarity its nature.

After infecting a member of our spelunking team with its facehugger-like stage, it then rips its way out of her face (like a chest burster). And although none of this really makes any sense, its a gory delight and it revels in what it accomplishes with its humble budget. My favorite part had to be the gore-slathered upside-down decapitation gag. Prime b-movie gore!

Spelunkers die, show their boobs, and run around stalagmites in a panic. During this journey we encounter yet another stage of our monster shaped like a big stalagmite with gory tentacle-like pseudopods that lash about and mutilate faces. Additionally, these monsters can mimic their victims to create infected pod-person-clone decoys much as we find in The Thing (1982) or Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978). So now I really have no idea how their biology works, but we also can now imagine the threat these beings pose to humanity should they escape this cave system and find their way to a city.

This film works best when tentacles are lashing and no one is trying to move the story along. Whenever the plot does find development, its messy at best. So, watch this for what it is: a shameless Alien rip-off boasting fun gore.",1527552000,,2870,4.931677018633541

WARNING: This movie is not for kids, just adults, SUPER SCARY, GORY, BLOODY, AND A SCENE OF NUDITY.I got this for cristmas because i wanted the whole collection. By the end, i was going to give it to Goodwill. but i did not because i don't have to watch it, just keep it. I was that scared.(im 13 and scare easy) it was ok but could have more connections to the first film. the connection i noticed, a monster come out of a rock(egg in the first one) starts off as a snake like baby the kills people one by one as it grows. if you think about it, the ending is SUPER SCARY. I knew it was scary because I watched the trailer on in the internet, it was SCARY. I got parents to watch it with me. one mistake though, all the credits are in a differnt language.
OVERALL
