5126774,5,B0083TUECE,"I loved Dan Tanna when I was a kid .... still do and probably always will. Gorgeous Robert Urich (SWAT, Spencer for Hire) was not only one of the hottest guys on t.v. at the time, but this show was one of the most popular. I'm really not sure if there were more female viewers than male, any more than I can say for sure that Charlies Angels had more male viewers than female, but I'd venture a guess that the stats were pretty even along the gender lines. Guys wanted to be Dan Tanna, and girls .... well, we just wanted Dan Tanna - Ha! He was handsome, charming, compassionate, original, and of course a very good detective.

The series had everything a good detective show needed - i.e. a HOT detective, good story lines, a long list of familiar guest stars, a really cool theme song, great character rapport .... and most of all the excitement of the famous Las Vegas strip. For those old enough to remember what Vegas used to look like (before it became an adult Disneyland), seeing many of the classic hotels that no longer exist is an exciting venture. While I love ""new"" Vegas, I also have so many lovely memories of the ""old"" version. Oh, and while many of the hotels in this series are no longer standing, Dan Tanna's home still is. The building that was supposedly owned by his boss (Ross), played to a tee by the late great Tony Curtis, still stands behind Circus Circus ... although it's fenced off. I make it my business to look at it whenever I'm in Vegas. It makes me sad and happy all at once. While I'd like to think that Dan Tanna would be quietly retired by now, the unfortunate reality is that Robert Urich died way too young.

Some of the classic shows still hold up today. I believe that ""Vegas"" is one of those shows, probably because I'm enjoying it as much now as I did when it originally aired. In fact, as I was quite young back then, some of the episodes are not so familiar and it almost feels like watching the show for the first time. For anyone who has never seen the series, but might be looking for a good detective show from the past (sans the violence of most of today's shows), I'd highly recommend you give this series a chance. As far as season 3, volume 2, goes, I don't have any particular favorite episodes, but I can say that there is an interesting variety of situations presented. There was only one Archie Bunker, one George Jefferson, one Matt Dillon, one Six Million Dollar Man, one Columbo .... and so on and so forth. The actors who portrayed those characters did so in a way that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in those roles. The same goes for Dan Tanna, as far as I'm concerned. Robert Urich was and still is Dan Tanna ... the best detective Las Vegas has ever known. Oh, and also the best looking .... Ha!

I don't know why it took so long for this great detective series to finally make it to the world of DVDs, but I'm so happy to now have all 3 seasons. There was something very special about the detective shows that aired back in the 70s and 80's ... a certain charm that rarely exists these days. If you're young and have only known the much more graphic, violent and intense dramas / detective shows of recent times, you might find a show like Vegas to be dated or corny. If you're open to a good show from the past, then give it a try. I can't say enough good things about this series. Loved it then; love it now !!!! R.I.P Dear Sweet Robert! You will never be forgotten!",1400025600,5,3442,4.300462249614792
5126775,5,B0083TUECE,Love Vegas and this dvd made for great tv watching. it's good to go back and watch old tv shows,1397001600,,95,3.8
5126776,4,B0083TUECE,Always loved this show when I was a kid.  Those Las Vegas lights really made the show good + good acting by all actors in the tv show.  Season 1 & 2 were all good too.,1394928000,,167,3.611111111111111
5126777,5,B0083TUECE,"This is a great old TV show.  This was made when I was just born, but my mother recommended it based on my taste in older TV shows.  Robert Urich is fun to watch and the plots are exactly what you would expect for the 70's- kind of cheesy, but definitely fun and entertaining!!  So much better than the dribble that passes for entertainment today.  I love the views of old Vegas and the old cars and clothes.  A great series- I have all the DVD's!!",1388016000,,448,4.162790697674419
5126778,4,B0083TUECE,I'm sorry this series ended so soon.  I really like Robert Urich as an actor and this is one of the great shows I grew up watching.,1374364800,,131,3.8518518518518516
5126779,5,B0083TUECE,I love Robert Urich and this show was great!  It takes you back to old Vegas before it became so commercial.,1370995200,,108,4.142857142857143
5126780,5,B0083TUECE,"I have the three seasons of Las Vegas Season 1,2,and 3 starring Robert Urich and others. I enjoy
several things about the different shows. The videos are all very good audio and video the sound
and picture quality is great.  I enjoy looking at the Vegas then (a lot of the buildings casinos
shown in the videos aren't there today)  The story or the (entertainment) in the videos are all
great. I would rate all three seasons the same all great.",1363824000,,444,4.469135802469136
5126781,5,B0083TUECE,"I was only two when this great show was on but, I saw it in reruns for most of my childhood! It made my year to find all three seasons on DVD. This is giving me the chance to show my nine year old that while some times shows can have blood and hurting in them that doesn't have to be all the show is About.  In Vega$  you can see where a lot of the shows a heading but, it's how they get to the truth that's the best!
If any one is looking for a show with action and drama this is one of the best! Having the late Robert Urich  in it is a great plus! I may have only been a little girl when I first saw him however, even then I could tell you the man was HOT!  Thanks for bring this show back. Now if we can get Spencer for Hire on DVD that would be great!",1360886400,2,756,3.6196319018404908
5126782,5,B0083TUECE,"Vegas:the Third Season, Vol 2 was what I had been waiting for.  Hope the remaining seasons of the series will be released very soon.  A great series.  The series can be funny, serious, and I love Twoleaf and Tony Curtis whenever they appear.",1359849600,,241,4.558139534883721
5126783,5,B0083TUECE,"This is the final installment in Vega$, one of my all time favorites. I wish it was released in Full seasons, but I had to have all of them. They did a great job remastering and although several of the episodes were corny, I still enjoyed watching them and seeing the weekly Guest stars. I have met a couple of the actors over the years and they mentioned how much fun it was to film in Vegas back in the ""old days.""

Back in the 80's, I went to the property near the Circus Circus to see Tanna's house/office. It was in bad shape but we imagined Dan rolling in the garage door in the T-Bird. We miss you, Robert!",1359244800,3,613,4.108333333333333
5126784,4,B0083TUECE,"This is a 3 disc set of Vegas containing the second half of season 3, the last season(11 episodes). Following the previous sets, there are no special features save for 'Episodic Promos' and subtitles in English. Picture and Audio quality are on par with the previous sets.

The last half of season 3 features the return of 'Slick' in 2 separate episodes. 'Binzer' who usually just gets bit parts, is featured in his own story as a couple of old cronies come back for his hide. Also Lt. Nelson is featured in his own story as he is set up by an elaborate ploy to be charged with murder as he gets a taste of being on the other side of the law.

And 'Mr. Las Vegas' Wayne Newton makes a return to the Vega$ set. In this episode a deranged stalker/killer who happens to be a Lounge Singer in a strip club wants to be the only Wayne Newton(this is the same actor who played a crippled vet who was hell bent on getting revenge on Dan Tanna during season 1). We get to hear Wayne perform his famous song 'Danke Schoen' as well as Frank Sinatra's 'My Way'. I'm glad to see that all the original music is intact in this episode.

The usual drawback to this release is that it is rather pricey for only half a season with no special features. But I am glad that this series is now complete and I have the whole collection(many other older TV shows are still stuck in limbo at season 1 or 2 with nothing on the horizon).",1357344000,3,1410,4.214814814814815
5126785,5,B0083TUECE,I really enjoyed seeing Vega$ again. The product came and was in excellent shape. It was awesome to see  the stories and was visually impressive as there was no degredation at all.

5126788,5,B0083TUECE,It says this is the end of the series.......but what about the rest od the seasons????are they not going to release the ones that had Judy Landersin them as  Angie????? there were episodes I was really looking forward to seeing and they were not in the first 3 seasons.....are they going to release more season?????does anyone know  or are they really going to stop at season  ??????? hope someone out there knows and can tell me PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!,1345248000,,446,4.766233766233766
5126789,3,B0083TUECE,"First off, as has been stated many times in reviews about the six (rip-off!!!) half-seasons, the nostalgic pleasures of seeing Las Vegas before it veered off into steroid-like development hell is worth it even if the plots were akin to the A-Team.  The plots in Season 3, part 2 may not have been cartoonish, but they were, in my humble opinion, even more banal than what preceeded them.  Also, the transfer quality left something to be desired as these episodes are clearly not as crystal clear as the other releases of Vega$.",1345248000,3,527,4.717391304347826
