5931183,5,B00EOMJAGA,"I loved this movie,  It happens more then people think and sometime the person do change.
I have it with my travel movies.  The ones I go to when on vacation or Girlfriends getaways.",1403481600,,182,4.323529411764706
5931184,3,B00EOMJAGA,I purchased in bulk a group of Black movies and this one was better than most of the others.  I recommend it.,1399420800,,109,3.9545454545454546
5931185,5,B00EOMJAGA,This DVD came on time and in the condition promised. I saw this film on TV and enjoyed the story and actors so much I had to get this for my collection. I have  18 and 11 year old daughters and this was an excellent story of marriage but also about honoring Gods design of marriage (abstinence). It shows that God still loves all despite our choices and that others can change after making poor choices in life. Excellent film!,1394928000,,427,4.3375
5931186,4,B00EOMJAGA,NICE MOVIE I ENJOYED IT. IF YOU LIKE A NICE CLEAN MOVIE YOU WILL ENJOY IT. IT HAD FUNNY AND SAD PARTS. IT HAD A NICE ENDING.,1393891200,,124,3.6296296296296298
5931187,4,B00EOMJAGA,I really enjoyed this movie.  One sister falls in love with a man that her sister was involved that did not have a happy ending.  So her sister tried to encourage her to sever contact with this man for fear that she will be treated bad just as she was.,1392681600,,252,4.02
5931188,3,B00EOMJAGA,This is the kind of movie that you watch when you are looking for light entertainment that requires no thinking. The outcome was predictable. There was no real suspense. It qualifies as something to do to ward off boredom.,1389139200,2,222,4.717948717948718
5931189,1,B00EOMJAGA,"This is by far the ""worst"" movie I have ever seen. It is so bad until, I don't have words to describe the horror of it all! ...worse than a Tyler Perry play!",1388880000,,157,3.787878787878788
5931190,4,B00EOMJAGA,"This film was very entertaining. Its about relationships, honesty and forgiveness. Should you tell your mate about your past? Should you forgive someone if they don't tell you everything about their past relationships? I enjoyed this film and especially enjoyed the performances of the lovely women in cast. Jazsmin Lewis is always a treat. This film would be rated PG-13 for mature themes and one brief scene featuring strippers. No profanity or sex scenes. Highly recommended for fans or romantic comedies.",1388880000,4,508,5.283950617283951

8607486,3,B00EOMJAGA,This movie was not all that!,1458777600,,28,3.8333333333333335
8607487,5,B00EOMJAGA,"This is made to look like a play filmed before a live audience, using mainly one set. It's probably just a laugh track, but approach it like you are watching a play and not an actual movie. When viewed with that attitude, I think you can find it enjoyable.

I bought it for one reason - KD Aubert has one of the lead roles and I think she is probably earth's most beautiful woman. This DVD gives you a chance to see all of her different facial expressions and features, and probably gives more of her than anything else she has done.  I think she showed a lot of talent as an actor, and don't understand why she can't get better roles. I wish the lighting had been better so you could really see her eyes, but it's hard to tell much about them.

 I gave it 5 stars because of her, but I would give 5 stars to ""KD Goes to the Grocery Store,"" so take that for what it's worth.",1442880000,,874,4.063953488372093
8607488,5,B00EOMJAGA,"This is a great movie. Even though her sister dated the guy years ago & yes he was a dog, that was before her time. I'm glad she went through with her wedding. This is how females should be in this day & time. Love the person for who you got them as ant for the pass person they were.",1419724800,,284,3.75

8607491,3,B00EOMJAGA,It's an okay film but I have one question. Why is there a laugh track in the movie or is this a play? I am very confused.,1414368000,,121,3.5185185185185186
8607492,1,B00EOMJAGA,no comments,1412121600,,11,5.0
8607493,3,B00EOMJAGA,I support independent black films but I want to see something f substance.  Unfortunately thias one missed the mark for me.  It's story is simplistic and not believable.  if you just want to see a black film for the sake of seeing a balcak film then this is one to add you to your collection.,1404777600,3,292,4.2727272727272725
8607494,4,B00EOMJAGA,A great DVD!,1404432000,,12,3.3333333333333335
