8520340,3,B007PK9MZM,"Each of the stories are original frightening tales that range from the classic slasher to the vampire metamorphosis and the black comedy gorefest. Rotten Classmates is a fun short that is both creative and entertaining. Vampires Lust reminds me of 80s horror comedies with a little John Waters insanity. It is a very funny throwback that completely entertains in true low budget style. Resident Emo could have been fun to watch if it wasn't so offensive and insensitive to the Emo culture. I didn't care for this short but it has a couple of entertaining moments. Mama, Its A Mannequin  is a funny and twisted black comedy entertaining and original. My favorite of the set.

Treasure Chest Of Horrors has the goods to both entertain and shock. There are some moments of great visual vulgarity that brings the funny home with uncontrollable bowel release and gory wittiness. Percival Pirate is very appealing as Horror Host, (and I have to get gay here) very easy on the eyes. I personally did not care for the AIDS comment in reference to Vampires Lust but everything else about this anthology is freshly entertaining filled with dark insanity.",1431216000,,1144,4.891752577319588

8520342,3,B007PK9MZM,"Soooo,Shawn C Phillips is kind of an Icon in Indy Flix and he talked Lloyd (Troma boss) Kaufman into helping him with this effort.

This anthology has a host,That is no Johnny Depp by a long shot.

ROTTEN CLASSMATES  was ok.

VAMPIRES LUST  Well, It does have a Giant Vampire Bat,Thats cool. The parent actors are odd,with no flow of comedy. The character of TOBIAS,is a sad boy. He looks like Herman Munster as a vampire. Shawn actually plays a amateur filmmaker,big stretch ,Sir !

RESIDENT EMO -

Now,This segment has a wrist cutting scene,and with the Robin Williams suicide,It was probably too soon to review but,It ran in the middle of film and so review continues. Lloyd Kaufman inserts one of his crazy segments,But he did do alot of FART & POOP jokes while in a public restrooms. What pulls you out of the moment( IF this flick has any moments) is multiple mentions of Myspace and not Facebook. There is even a stolen gag, Similar to RON FORD having a Arm Ripping Off   to great effect. There was even a EDDIE DEEZEN lookalike to add some real comedy. Wow, There was Pee as Lemonade and Poop as Zombie Repellant

MOMMA,ITS A MANNEQUIN -

was ok,for an ending.",1407888000,,1168,4.54066985645933
8520343,2,B007PK9MZM,"This movie is really bad. Not going to lie about that. but it's also really fun to watch and laugh at. It feels like an old school Shot on Video Troma style film. The gore is sometimes even spaggetti. If you like watching horror films on youtube like I do you might enjoy this. It's not a good movie, it doesn't try to be a good movie, but it is fun to kick back and laugh at it with your friends.",1384560000,,397,3.9135802469135803
8520344,5,B007PK9MZM,"So great!  Not only are the viciously campy movies incredibly watchable, but the directors commentaries are really fun too. Lots of blood & gore, lots of horror drive in style mayhem. I'm glad to see that good movies of this kind aren't a thing of the past.",1374969600,,257,4.468085106382978
8520345,4,B007PK9MZM,Pure drive in style carnage is how I would describe Treasure Chest of Horrors. Kept me busy last weekend. My friends and I really enjoyed it. Thumbs up I say!,1374710400,,158,4.3
8520346,4,B007PK9MZM,"I've bought a few compilations in the past and there are usually a few clunkers in the bunch, but I must say this was surprisingly good throughout. Low budget, indie, drive in style carnage. It rocks.",1362528000,,200,4.583333333333333
8520347,5,B007PK9MZM,i bought this movie because one of the producers is my boyfriend. far away from that the movie overall is good. is a copilation of shorts that are goofy. if you are interested in a horro movie well this is not for you this movie is more black goofy humor. i really enjoy it.,1355184000,,274,4.092592592592593
8520348,5,B007PK9MZM,"I love Horror anthologies Creepshow and all the greats, SO when I saw this i was very pleased it's definitely worth a watch... A very cool anthology from horrors top indie filmMakers makes this a cult classic in the making!",1335312000,6,223,4.6
