I have read the novel which is so funny and horny(\./)
I enjoyed anime more than the novel.

This could be some refreshment when you feel down. You can laugh and have MOE feeling^^^^

However, the voice of KYOSUKE is soooo good and sexy. Shinichiro Miki is the best (yaoi) voice actor!!
His voice always kills me...that is probably the reason why this anime has been my best.....",1282176000,2,435,4.481012658227848

Not so innocent Jane Wyman educates Niven in how to live a real life, but then Niven falls for her. They aren't really suited for each other (she's not a fan of his beloved classical music &he pretends to like jazz...can love thrive among lies ? ) Fluffy grade B movie",1466812800,,370,4.3

8565446,2,B00BBI6VOY,"Wonderful actors can't make up for silly screen play.  And when I say ""silly,"" I certainly don't mean ""funny.""  My favorite character was Victor Moore as Horace Willoughby.  Watching him, I thought he was Sidney Toler (of Charlie Chan fame).  Aside from the awful writing, the second-worst thing about this movie is the music.  It is just fine to use well-known classical music in movies.  But, the soundtrack in THIS film is sloppy and extremely amateurish.  If you want late-forties comedies, in terms of quality, this one would be near the bottom of MY list.",1414800000,,561,4.842105263157895
8565447,3,B00BBI6VOY,"With A Kiss in the Dark, Warner Bros's modest 1949 comedy, David Niven channels a bit of Cary Grant, a fellow paragon of elegance. Niven plays neurotic concert pianist Eric Phillips who has a freak out moment when he strikes a false note during his latest playing engagement. Not even his staff's celebration of his 21st year anniversary in the music industry could keep him from obsessing about this fail from perfection. To distract himself, having canceled all his summer bookings in a grumpy moment, Eric decides to get hands on with a new investment property acquired for him by his business agent: the Cleopatra Arms, an apartment building in Morningside Heights, New York City.

Turns out, Cleopatra Arms is fraught with repair needs, something which the hand-wringy building manager (Victor Moore) and the 53 tenants are quick to point out to their new landlord. And if you're wondering what's keeping our Nervous Nellie from right away amscraying out of there, the answer is that he runs into Jane Wyman's character. Polly Haines (Wyman) is a photographer's model. She's lovely and jaunty and down-to-earth and effortlessly wins Eric over. She's also one of the most vociferous tenants in advocating for improvements at Cleopatra Arms. It's almost too much for the uptight, high-strung fella, except that Ms. Haines is so tremendously appealing. Eric even stands up to a bullying tenant (Broderick Crawford) just to champion her. For his trouble he gets socked in the face.

David Niven showcases his knack for slapstick comedy here. He does a bit of mugging and indulges in a pratfall or two. He may not be as good as Cary Grant at balancing the witty bon mot with the physical comedy, but then again who's as good at it as Cary Grant? It's a good cast that lends to fun and chuckles. Jane Wyman, glamorous yet grounded, makes you wish you lived back in the day when the Hollywood studio system safeguarded its stars and hid all the warts. It's sort of a shame that, today, paparazzi and social media have reduced plenty of celebrities into laughing stock. I liked it when I could look up to those folks and their movies meant more. Oh, hey, crap, is that a soap box?

Anyway, I thought Jane Wyman was fine here, never mind that the critics circa 1949 thought she was slumming after her 1948 Oscar win for Johnny Belinda.

A Kiss in the Dark is amiable and amusing and even affords Niven's milquetoast character a measure of retaliation in the end. And why is Niven in need of retaliation? Well, there's his seedy business agent (Joseph Buloff) and the jealous rival (Wayne Morris) for Polly's affections. For me, the standout is Broderick Crawford who plays the bullying tenant. Dude works the night shift and so craves absolute peace and quiet during the day so he could sleep. Except he's real aggressive and nasty in his demanding of it. Several droll highlights are provided when Niven and Wyman address the problem of this imposing brute of a bully. And Crawford's reactions are to die for and build up to an awesome crescendo.

Conversely, more awkward than droll is the sequence in which Niven takes his tenant kids out on a hike to demonstrate his mad outdoorsy skills. He doesn't have mad outdoorsy skills. Poor David Niven gets pummeled and lambasted and put upon thru the course of the film, and from most of these inconveniences he reacts with a frosty, punctured ego stare. This is where he and Cary Grant part company, as Grant would've come up with something more inventive than that.

Word on the street: Niven didn't actually play the piano. Instead, an expert pianist threaded his hands thru the sleeves of Niven's tail coat and those are his stunt fingers you see cavorting on the piano keys.",1413590400,3,3722,4.780715396578538

8565450,5,B00BBI6VOY,"An excellent film with David Niven and Jane Wyman in the romantic lead. The twist is in the way the story line is built up and the happy but satisfactory ending. The corrupt manager reminds us that the title of this piece has held through the ages, only the level of corruption differs in society.
A film that can be watched by one and all.",1368144000,6,340,4.246153846153846
