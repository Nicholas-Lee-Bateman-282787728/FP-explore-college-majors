Andy Lau is Cheung Dee, a low-level triad boss( kinda like ChanHoNam in the First Y&D)He finds himself double-crossed by those he trusts and hunted by those he's hurt.
What happened is that years ago, Cheung saved the boss from the rival triad, and gained his fame and notoriety. But now, he's nothing but a joke to the triad fam.
Then a lawyer Sandy( Gigi Leung) comes into the picture.....
see in the movie, Cheung is a good guy. Unfortunately, Wong Jing's triad world is not the one glorified in movies like Young&Dangerous. Cheung being disrespected by people comes from the fact that him being righteous is inot good in the world of triad, he becomes everyone's witch and whipping boy. It isn't until Dee takes a stand and fights back that he regains his self-respect.
This is Andy's one of best performances ever, not as good as *Moment of Romance* i guess, but it's still pretty good.",1028937600,2,1073,4.652631578947369

And how successful is this movie, well ill let you decide... but in my opinion, i found it nothing more than average.
Having a host of personalities which im sure will get most of the Hong Kong movie fanatics pointing at the screen and thinking 'hey, i know that guy from somewhere', it was these people which i had expected to shine from the movie but had somewhat disappointing, and mundane personalities.
The atmosphere was nothing special for a triad movie. Plot, can be summed up simply - father wants to leave the triad and go straight for his son's sake (with touches of romance, betrayal revenge blah blah).
yeh its an ok movie and i suggests you go see it if you haven't already seen it. But its nothing that captures the imagination, heart, or your long term memory.
Go see a 'moment of romance'. :) its a better attempt of a similar movie.
Also, just a note to those whove seen this movie. Whats the go with andy getting with those two chicks and like still being portrayed as a nice guy. (...)",1005177600,,1221,4.383259911894273

7913982,4,B00000JZJE,"True Mob Story is a great movie. It has everything-romance, humor, and a lot of violence-so I would not recommend it at all for children. Everyone else should definitely see this. The storyline is good and there a lot of action and fighting scenes but the fighting scenes are a bit weak since Andy Lau isn't much of an action hero (not your Jet Li or Jacky Chan). You will be shocked by the surprise ending!",985305600,,407,4.368421052631579
