4235092,5,B003ZMEBMS,"I really enjoyed watching these talent artists. They cover safety, which can't be overlooked! Their ideas and demos were clear and one could go and do them with confidence. I paint on boards primarily in encaustic, but I am going to work on paper too. It's quite intriguing. Loved it!",1306454400,5,284,4.7

4235094,5,B003ZMEBMS,"I just spent 2 hours, in the comfort of my living room, with 3 of the most fabulous teachers ever ! As someone who has just taken an interest in Encaustic (wax) art I was mesmerized right from the first opening minutes.
These 3 gals have put together a whopper of techniques and samples & made them easily understandable, fun and doable. This DVD is worth double the money for what you gain from it.
I also own Daniella Woolfs 'Encaustic with a Textile Sensibility', another mind blowing presentation.
Makes you want to hop on a plane and zoom over to California just to meet them and learn from them in person....this DVD is not to be passed up.",1290211200,8,646,4.436974789915967
4235095,5,B003ZMEBMS,"This superb DVD follows on the outstanding one available earlier (Encaustic with a Textile Sensibility) by Daniella Woolf.  In this new one, the three teachers from WaxWorksWest studio demonstrate a wide range of techniques and projects done using paper and encaustic.  This includes, but is not limited to, collages, transfers, burning and rusting, and so much more!  The DVD is not only fascinating, but it is humorous at the same time as it is educational. The filming is beautiful, with remarkable close-ups while the artists are working. It's easy to watch, and gives the viewer all the basics, safety information, and new skills.  Each of the three artists completes a project in her own style in each section of the DVD.  An excellent source for both beginners and more experienced artists.  Strongly recommended, and would also make a great gift for any artistic person!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Encaustic-With-A-Textile-Sensibility/dp/B003804YQ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Encaustic With A Textile Sensibility</a>",1289865600,2,1066,6.026490066225166
4235096,5,B003ZMEBMS,"This dvd is just great. I learned things I thought I already knew. The format is fun, friendly and informative. Those wax ladies really know what they are talking about. I highly recommend this dvd!",1289692800,,198,4.685714285714286
4235097,5,B003ZMEBMS,"The video, ""Encaustic + Paper"" was made by the women who run one of the best encaustic art schools in the country, maybe even the world.  Wendy Aikin, Judy Stabile and Daniella Woolf are the women who founded Wax Works West, in beautiful Santa Cruz County, California.  They know what they are talking about, and this is a good way to start learning encaustics.  To see encaustic being done is much better than reading a book.  And even people who are not ready to work on paper with encaustic paint, this is still a video that teaches much.  In addition, Wendy and Judy and Daniella bring a lot of fun to the learning process.  And in the end, the fire safety portion of ""Encaustic + Paper"" is taught with the help of Santa Cruz County firefighters.  After learning from the video, you would do well to learn more by taking classes at their school.",1289692800,8,849,4.474025974025974
8410647,5,B003ZMEBMS,Great if you are into encaustics....every vignette teaching session on the dvd is interesting and well presented. Not for beginners but certainly fir intermediate encaustics users.,1488931200,,180,5.961538461538462
8410648,5,B003ZMEBMS,A really good DVD for encaustic painters and paper artists. These artist are some of my favorite so I guess I am a bit biased but for anyone wanting to add wax to their art this is a great DVD to purchase.,1411171200,,205,3.9047619047619047
8410649,5,B003ZMEBMS,"Excellent working studio & shared techniques of 3 great encaustic artists. Many alternate uses of hot wax & papers.
Safety tips were great as well.",1392854400,,147,4.92
8410650,2,B003ZMEBMS,"I was disappointed with this DVD. It was very expensive in the first place at $45 and even more so because I had to pay an extra 14+ (around $24) because full postage hadnt been paid and there was 8 duty tax for items from US! (making a total of almost $70!) The ladies are all very charming and present their work in the best way possible but I was disappointed because quite a few of these ideas  are already on YouTube. I found they were too specific and limited considering the vast potential for using paper and encaustic together. It would have been good to have further suggestions for other ideas that perhaps weren't videoed. I have another DVD by Danielle Woolf that is included in her book, The Encaustic Studio, a brilliant book and DVD that I would recommended and which offers a multitude of ideas and suggestions in an extremely well presented way.",1384819200,2,863,4.532051282051282
8410651,5,B003ZMEBMS,Brilliant! What a trio of incredibly talented and amazing women. Ideas galore mixed with wonder senses of humor - a definite must have for all artists!,1381104000,,151,4.846153846153846
8410652,5,B003ZMEBMS,"Have Only seen half,of,this,DVD..but so far it is very informative.. Great demos and good explanations of techniques..great for beginners too",1372896000,,141,6.1
8410653,3,B003ZMEBMS,"This video is a good visual reference for many encaustic techniques, however, nothing really extraordinary was taught. I was hoping for something that was beyond the basics. Something that showed techniques that could only be done with paper, perhaps more about using it to create 3-D pieces which do not also use a cradled board. I guess all I'm trying to say is: if you've been experimenting with this medium for a while, there won't be much (especially 45$ worth) that you haven't already been introduced to.",1360713600,6,511,4.885057471264368
8410654,4,B003ZMEBMS,"These ladies know their business.  I want to paint landscapes and seascapes.  However, most of their paintings were abstract and collage.  I would also like to do transfer of images. I have only seen part of this DVD so far. I will have to go over it again and again to completely understand it.  Also, I should probably take a workshop on it.  I have bought some of the supplies, but it can get expensive fast. I have to review more paintings done with this medium to determine what I really need.  So far, I have painted in Oils and Watercolor. I had studied watercolor for over 20 years and have been teaching it for the past few years. Encaustic looks interesting.",1356825600,,668,4.434426229508197
8410655,3,B003ZMEBMS,"this was very good content, but a bit overpriced. if a booklet would have come along with it, for easier reference, it would have been a more practical way to access its content. but, nice work, none the less.",1354665600,,209,4.384615384615385
8410656,5,B003ZMEBMS,"This video is full of wonderful information and ideas for the encaustic artist. I am new to this technique and i found i learned everything i need to know to get started and enjoy this medium. I have now some great ideas and inspiration to get out my wax and get into some serious art.
Being able so 'see'the experts do each technique is good for the visual learner, and the fact that some things went wrong and we saw how to 'fix' the problems is a bonus. The ladies from 'Wax Works West' are very inspiring artists with many years experience as artists and teachers. I would recommend this dvd to anyone interested in this exciting medium but does not know where to start.",1314835200,4,674,4.4
