All of the characters fighting have grown enourmously since the Namek saga, you get a real feel for how tremendous the difference is in their fighting power where  one can dominate when the other can't even land a hit, constantly switching the leadership. Now Piccolo's strength is surpassed by Vegeta, who is given the power he thinks is of a super saiyan by the reluctant Krillin and Dende, who hurt and heal him, releasing a Saiyan's true power. But even then he's not even able to touch Frieza, who undergoes his final transformation. This video is critical to any collection of the Frieza saga, it creates the feel for just how everyone stands powerwise for the final battle - Goku vs Frieza!",987379200,,782,4.666666666666667
7892644,5,6305646147,"After Piccolo arrives on Namek, he fuses with the near-dead Nail and joins the others. Things get worse as Frieza transforms into his most ugliest but very cool form yet (as seen on the cover). After taking a beating from Piccolo, Vegeta and Gohan, Frieza brings out the big guns by transforming to his final form. Because Vegeta is now more powerful thanks to Dende, Frieza fire his first shot at Dende and kills him. This tape serves up to the final battle against Frieza and also sends the message that play time is over. Frieza is at his limit. An overall good volume. I'd recommend seeing this uncut because there is a lot of violent moments on this tape you must see to beleive.",979344000,,684,4.48

For a long time now I have waited patiently for Ronin Warriors to come out with some sort of video but I have waited in vain. there is no reason for it not  to be on a video the television show gets alot of attention I mean not as  much as DragonBall Z but still alot I am sorry to have taken up your time,  but for anyone who sympathizes with me please say so.
