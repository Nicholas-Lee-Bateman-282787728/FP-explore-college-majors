7809149,5,6301017250,The Dead Don't Die is a 1970's television film starring Joan Blondell. She is always worth watching. Fans of Joan Blondell will like this the most.,1434412800,,147,4.6923076923076925
7809150,4,6301017250,"THE DEAD DON'T DIE is another great made-for-TV movie from the fabulous 1970s. Directed by Curtis Harrington (NIGHT TIDE, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO HELEN?, WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?, THE KILLING KIND, etc.), and written by Robert Bloch (PSYCHO), TDDD is a noir-ish zombie film starring George Hamilton and Ray Milland (X: THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES, THE PREMATURE BURIAL, FROGS, THE ATTIC). Loaded w/ creepy atmosphere, mystery, and voodoo, it's a shame to see it still languishing on VHS tape! this movie is better than a lot of the dreck that has been on DVD for years! Why this hasn't made it to disc is beyond me! Sheesh...",1358121600,3,622,4.768518518518518
7809151,3,6301017250,"Wait, a Curtis Harrington film that I've never heard of, and a zombie movie to boot! Amazon, make this available in your ""made to order"" DVD collection! And while you're at it, Killer Bees, please. And Fragment of Seeking. I know it's only a short but it needs to be available somewhere. NEED MOAR CURTIS HARRINGTON. I gave it 3 stars because I've never seen it.",1353196800,2,362,4.5
7809152,5,6301017250,"I remember watching this movie on tv in the 70s as kid all alone one night, and it gave me the creeps.  I have only seen it once, but I still remember it nearly 40 years later .  I can't say that about many other movies  I have seen.  I was hoping to find it cheap on DVD.  Highly recommended.",1343606400,5,293,3.816666666666667
7809153,3,6301017250,"the dead don't die is an average made for tv movie,it has a good cast ray milland ,george hamilton,among others but the story is pretty slow.it is set during the thirties.a few spooky scenes but the end is a letdown but if it is a slow rainy night you might like it.",1298505600,,266,4.134615384615385
7809154,3,6301017250,"This is a great popcorn movie for a rainy Saturday afternoon. The plot is pretty simple...an innocent man is sent to the electric chair and his brother (George Hamilton) tries to find out the real suspect.  Keep in mind this is a budget movie and if you are looking to get scared out of your wits, you might be disappointed. This is an earlier film for George Hamilton, and one of the last for Ray Milland. The opening scene of the falsely accused getting prepared for the electric chair(complete with priest) is quite dramatic. The Sound quality is not very good, but the movie does take the classic Zombie theme and gives it more of a lift (they talk and act normal).",1254009600,,669,4.483606557377049
7809155,3,6301017250,"I love zombie movies and in that case, this one is disappointing.  Not your typical zombies.  Aside from a couple, these act normal, talk, and aren't too interested in eating brains.
I've seen some horrible b-movies that drag forever and this one isn't one of those.  It is 75 minutes long and, to me, was entertaining.  The story is puzzling and makes you shake your head.  Some of the images and scenes are just haunting in the lack of people in this old big city.  If this was seen in theaters, I'm sure there are a few moments that would make the audience jump.
It's not a fantastic movie by any sense of the imagination, but it's not as bad as the two previous reviewers make it sound.",1086566400,4,690,4.3515625
7809156,1,6301017250,"I saw this movie on sale for only $3 so I got it. Hey, what do I have to lose? Well, I lost $3. Even for a measley $3 I feel ripped off. There is no redeeming quality in this movie, it drags and drags with no substance, not a single scary or enlightening moment. Just a really bad 70's film. It had Poor film quality, corny dialouge, ridiculous zombies (were they even trying to make them look liek zombies), boring music scores. The basis of the stroy was some guy's brother gets the electric chair. And before his brother died, he made a promise to find the real killer of his sister in law. Turns out there was some stupid plot about a zombie master. The story on the back of the box made it sound like a big epic apocalyptic movie because the ""Zombie Master"" (who's just some old ugly guy) tries to take over the world with zombies (which are just people that give you blank stares, oh yeah and there was only one zombie) Throughout the whole film I was so bored that I actually wished I was in math class! By all means avoid at all costs and if you haven't seen this pathetic excuse of a movie yet, count your blessings. The title makes it soudns like one of those artsy italian zombie films but it's not. The movie has no effect on the viewers at all. You'll just see fuzzy people talking about silly things and giving poor performances over a story that doesn't make sense. I read somewhere this was a made for tv movie, of all the things to show on tv, why show people this?!",1080172800,2,1483,4.207017543859649
7809157,2,6301017250,"This Made for TV movie from the mid-70s although the only memory I had of it was the symbol emblazened on the palms of the zombies...(a snake I think).  Starts out with the execution of a man and his long lost brother comes to say goodbye and to avenge his brother's death by proving his innocence.  Seeing his brother after the execution he follows his brother into a shop only to discover he's not really there. Hmmmm..... Well, he turns to the owner of a dance hall for help, a place where his brother had won a dance marathon once...turns out this guy is the ""Zombie Master""  and he likes to bring back dead people through voodoo who have unjustly died.  He apparently wants to gather enough of them to take over the world.  But, George Hamilton soon puts a stop to this, even though nobody believes him...  There are several holes here and there and you can't quite figure out what the hell is going on.  But being such a simple script, you can pretty much fill in the gaps on your own.  This movie does have somewhat of a creepy feel, but that's about as scary as this thing gets.  No blood, no guts, no brain munching... Just zombies that look like me and you.  Here's hoping they don't put this one on DVD.",1030924800,,1214,4.331858407079646
