388957,1,6301966651,"This Alan J Pakula directed attempt at horror is probably best known as the film that sunk Kristy McNichol's film career. Perhaps McNichol was swayed to take the advice of Pakula after his previous title led Meryl Streep to a Best Actress Oscar, but his idea of extending McNichol's acting range reads more as a total misappreciation of her appeal. The list of inexplicables begin with making McNichol practically mute as a flutist with a controlling father. Her victim pose earns her an assault after she disobeys daddy, and then recurring nightmares triggered by the trauma. This leads her to Ben Masters and a sleep research centre, who teaches her recounting procedures to control her dreams. McNichol has the kind of dreams I've never had - where she can see herself - and about the laugh in the entire film (apart from McNichol in Daddy's little girl outfits, and her faux period look in a George Seurat painting come to life) is Pakula's repeating of the stages of her dream. Being an experimental research centre, of course Masters' initial success with McNichol soon turns to the unexpected. It is with the progressive worsening of McNichol's nightmares that all logic leaves the screenplay by Jon Boorstin. We're told McNichol is a rare kind of dreamer who isn't muscle paralyzed - she moves as if awake. But then Masters has to give her an injection to produce this effect. Then we learn there is a second injection to reverse the first one. Soon McNichol is dreaming of Masters and not flatteringly, and his scientific hunger makes him unwilling to wake her up during a particularly gratuitous encounter. The climax of McNichol run amok as if Frankenstein's monster crossed with Freud leads to the inevitable confrontation with daddy, with DOP Sven Nykvist confusing us with different tints to suggest McNichol's differing conscious states. And the final scene is pure lunacy, culminating in the worst cheat shot I can recall in a while. The transition of child actors into mature roles is tough. Jodie Foster survived with her share of bruises, but poor McNichol ended up in TV's Empty Nest after her encounter with actor's director Pakula. Perhaps both of them thought they could do another Klute, without realising that Jane Fonda rescued Pakula in that one.",998092800,13,2273,4.93733681462141

7818154,5,6301966651,"Kristy McNichol soars in one of her most stellar performances as an assault victim plagued by sleep disorders. The film is an enjoyable roller coaster ride drifting into serene dreams, eerie scientific sleep disorder experiments, frightening nightmares laced with two timing love and stark confessions leading up to an edge-of-your-seat climax. Kristy McNichol is TOP SHELF and should have won an Oscar. This extraordinary film is a must for Kristy McNichol fans.",1428537600,2,463,5.444444444444445

7818156,1,6301966651,"Alan J Pakula was one of the best thriller director's of the early 1970's (Klute; The Parallax View; All the President's Men) but by the end of the decade he had fallen on seriously hard times.  It's a toss up which is his worst film--Rollover, a paranoia thriller about Arabs pulling all of their money out of the US banking system at once in an effort to crash the US economy or this stinker about a musician with bad dreams. Kristy Mc Nichol plays a professional musician with daddy issues whose vivid dreams turn into disturbing nightmares after she kills a man in self-defense.  She eventually turns to a scientist involved in dream studies for help.  Dream Lover doesn't create any suspense at all for most of it's length because the nightmares are just bad dreams--no matter how disturbing Mc Nichol's dreams are they can't hurt her--she can't be killed by the dreams and they offer no clues that advance the story in any way.  Since the dreams have no real-life implications they seem mostly pointless and repetitive.  Only very late in the movie when the scientist gives Mc Nichol an experimental drug designed to let her act out her dreams then forgets to give her the antidote does the movie manage to generate a little suspense--since her dreams are so violent falling asleep could make her a danger to herself or others.  So Dream Lover does manage to come up with one good idea--but unfortunately it isn't until the end of the movie.  A few years later Wes Craven would figure out how to make movie nightmares scary with A Nightmare On Elm Street.  That's a nut that director Alan J Pakula definitely didn't manage to crack with Dream Lover--all he ultimately did was prematurely end the screen career of Kristy Mc Nichol, who never starred in another theatrical film after this turkey.",1375660800,,1800,4.710191082802548

There are some scary parts without having gore etc Dreams in itself is confusing and the nightmares McNichols character has brings you into a world of dreams that continue and you wonder what does it all mean?kristy McNichol is one of the Most Underrated actors,she has done some great amazing acting and this film proves how great she is ""Dream lover"" deserves a second look.",1347235200,,451,4.794871794871795

7818160,2,6301966651,"This ""Dream Lover"" (not to be confused with the 90's James Spader/Madchen Amick film of the same title) is a stinker.  It was the kind of lazily written film in which they depict how crazy the psycho-killer guy is by showing him lifting weights, cos, you know, the scriptwriter saw ""Taxi Driver"".  It did the same thing for Kristy McNichol's career that ""Fresh Horses"" did for that of Molly Ringwald.",1299196800,,400,4.7
7818161,4,6301966651,"It's a rare occasion when a film that is panned unmercifully, by critics and audiences, truly deserves a second chance. ""Dream Lover"" is such a film.
Instantly dismissed as a failure upon it's release, this film has been lurking in the forgotten zone, patiently awaiting its re-discovery by a future audience that enjoys surreal and creepy films. Time has indeed been very, very kind to this film. Kristy McNichol was perfectly cast in the lead role, even though it may not have seemed so during her ""teen-queen"" heydey. Her fans, and the critics, simply weren't ready to accept a mature Kristy, in a very mature role, and this is by far her most mature and challenging effort.
This in not a superb film, per say, and it does in fact have flaws, but the strong selling point here is the absolute, high-level creepiness and the amazing dream-like atmosphere that was so brilliantly captured. The director obviously wanted to confuse the viewers with the ""is she dreaming, or is it real"" factor, and he succeeded in spades without ever resorting to boring cliches. This is truly a very intriguing and original story, and perhaps its full potential wasn't completely realized, but it comes awfully close. Definitely close enough to entertain and satisfy fans of this particular type of thriller.
This is one of those films where the less said about it, the better. Hopefully, my general praise will encourage viewers to give it a chance. I believe this film could become a much delayed and very deserving sleeper.",1296000000,9,1510,4.879377431906615
7818162,3,6301966651,"This movie deals with the very real issue of what happens to a person who has had to kill in self defense(especially when it is not clear that it was necessary.) Kristy McNichol's performance in this film is very moving, and easily one of her best.  The film is a little difficult to follow at certain times and is definitely out of the box in some ways but is certainly  worth watching,  and a staple for any Kristy McNichol fan.",1264204800,11,430,4.35
