5622359,4,B00BI6SKYI,"I liked the way the director and writers kept the movie reasonably credible - once you got past the absurdity of a warrior woman with no warrior upbringing (it takes years of practice from a young age to develop the martial skills she was displaying) ruling over the men around her.  I liked the fact that the older farm girl does what can be expected and that when she wins she does so believably; she doesn't suddenly possess magical skills nor does fate intervene like winning the lottery.  Her character, courage and determination win out.  More like a 3.5 movie than a 4 but still enjoyable.",1373155200,,596,4.60377358490566

5622361,5,B00BI6SKYI,"The picture on the website is misleading, probably trying to draw comparisons to Centurion. At least they both show the antagonists.

The story was well told and the action believable for a young girl to be able to accomplish. It is a very beautiful country and the scenes are gorgeous.

The movie has sub-titles so if you are someone who finds it hard to follow a movie and read at the same time, you might want to stay away.

Awesome and INTENSE story plus superb acting. Awesome and superb video and audio quality throughout the whole movie. I just had my Pioneer Kuro elite plasma calibrated 2 weeks ago and this Bluray simply showed off its prowess.

I chose the Norwegian/Swedish version with English subtitles version since it was in high definition audio (DTS-HD MA). The English voice over version is stereo which I didn't like. Subtitles didn't bother me one bit and probably heightened the movie experience.

By all means ... this movie is extremely and highly recommended. You will NOT regret it one-bit! Excellent example of good triumphing over evil in the end ... but at a great cost indeed!!!",1371340800,5,860,4.804054054054054

5622365,4,B00BI6SKYI,"Nordic film with beautiful scenery. The acting is not theatrical, overloaded or too dramatic and that is why it is enjoyable. I like movies like this in which what the characters do is even more relevant than what they say they will do. It's not an action movie, but it has action. Although it is set in the middle ages, it is far from heroic knights or fancy castles. It is after all, a bucolic tale.",1464739200,,401,4.2894736842105265
5622366,4,B00BI6SKYI,"Isabel Christine Andreasen (a star is born) portrays Signe, a teen who witnesses the slaughter of her family in the opening scene. Such events turn Signe into a Norwegian Katniss Everdeen by the end of the flick (no archery practice needed: just add water). Our protagonist's little buddy is Frigg, a young girl who emotionally connects with Signe. Bombshell Ingrid Bols Berdal stars as the antagonist, Dagmar, the leader of a small band of brigands. Berdal does well in looking fierce, considering how the actress looks when not in front of a Steadicam. Kudos to her for shooting a medieval feature film without wearing makeup. Dagmar has a tragic backstory that is revealed midpoint. A very simplistic reduction: don't be mean to people, there's a good chance it'll turn them into a meanie too... violence begets violence, etc.

The plot is about one thing: care to guess? Nothing fancy, it's a marathon tale of escape, fairly well told. The cinematography and locations are fantastic, adding so much to the story. You can almost feel how hungry and exposed to the elements Signe and Frigg are as they wander through the wilderness... you'd have to own a heart of stone to not feel empathy. Side note: It's reassuring to know there are still some landscapes in Europe that look about the same as they did in the 14th century.

Let's not play that game where we try to find every instance of ""she would not have been able to do that!"" Yes, Signe goes from a Little House on the Prairie's Laura to a season 6 Arya Stark in like 5 days rather than 5 years, AND she is very lucky a number of times, but never underestimate the gumption of a teenage girl whose family you've killed, and don't forget these aren't suburban girls who can be shut down by taking their cell phones away (did I mention Norway circa 1360?) Also keep in mind that we don't say, ""Indiana Jones/ James Bond/ [insert any male action movie hero] is ridiculous, he couldn't have been able to do / survive that!"" We just don't say it... so why say it here?
Regardless, at its core Escape is a grrl power flick, so if you don't like those... you've been warned.

If it weren't for the bloodshed and attempted rapes, this might be considered more of a ""family movie""; whatever the case, I can see it appealing to tweens/teens and maybe their parents too.",1464048000,4,2319,4.610169491525424

5622388,2,B00BI6SKYI,"****Contains major spoilers****

Normally, I LOVE foreign movies, particularly movies from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. This one, however, rubbed me the wrong way. The leader of the gang (Dagmar) a woman, is the stereotypically ruthless shrew, unable to handle real power, so she's evolved into a battle-ax. (Yawn).

Come on! This isn't 1950!

I get it that she was wronged by locals who believed she was a witch. She and her little girl were subjected to trial by water or indicium aquae. In theory, water was supposed to reject the ""unholy""  including witches and vampires. Therefore, if the accused floats, it was proof of guilt, since the water was thought to have spit him/her out.  If the accused sank, this was proof of innocence, since the water was said to swallow him or her up.  (Either way, the poor soul drowned).

By some strange miracle, Dagmar survives to become the ultimate warrior woman/bada**/shrew. (Evil Xena, MOVE OVER!) Dagmar, pregnant at the time, not only watches helplessly as her little girl is drowned, but also miscarries. As a result of these injustices, she becomes every villager's nightmare.  (For some reason, she focuses her rage on Signe, whom she doesn't even know.)

Pop psychology notwithstanding, it's disappointing to see the same old stereotypes taken out of mothballs for use in the movie Escape.  Dagmar, who survives the water test to acquire ultimate battle skills, focuses her angst on her FEMALE adversary Signe. Signe, Dagmar's polar opposite, is a virginal woman-child who becomes the hero to save Frigg, the little girl that Dagmar kidnapped (?) to replace her own child (children) lost at the hands of villagers. The sensitive, compassionate characters in this movie are, of course, MEN.

Dagmar, mentally unhinged, uses her crossbow to kill her male companion who is only trying to protect little Frigg.

The Dagmar character was awful. We are supposed to believe that Dagmar goes from loving mother to dangerous psychopath as a result of injustice inflicted by the villagers? (Human beings are just not that simple). Next, Signe developes from a child uncertain of how she will survive herself to having battle skills sufficient to wipe out Dagmar's whole gang and defeat Dagmar, thanks to a 5 minute lesson on bear hunting.  (Watch the struggle with Dagmar - she makes mistakes no skilled warrior ever would).

Probably the most unbelievable is Signe's fall down the side of a cliff, which easily must have been at least an 80 foot drop! The chance of surviving such a fall WITH life threatening injury - is very slim. (Survival unscathed is nearly unheard of).  At the very least, Signe's internal injuries would be severe. No way she would have come away from such a fall without a closed head injury. Yet she wakes up, stands up and shakes herself off. Sorry to be so picky, but...
Bad, bad, bad!!

On the other side of the coin, the cinematography is wonderful. The actor who plays Dagmar is quite stunning. if eye candy is enough to sustain your attention, Escape has enough of that.  If you don't care about writing, plot, and aren't offended by sexist cliches, you'll probably love this movie. If you require deep character development and protagonists that make sense, skip this one.",1404345600,,3318,5.045787545787546
5622389,4,B00BI6SKYI,"There are no shortage of hunting movies where humans are the prey. You know, pretty much, how they're going to end, so you hope the ride is worth the fare. his isn't the best of them but the plus points far outweigh the minuses.

Here's the scoop. It's the second half of the 14th century in Sweden. Lawlessness abounds as the plague has finally subsided. A family of four hits the road and is set upon by a small band of brigands headed up by a fierce female. They kill mom, dad and the boy but grab the girl to act as sister to her ""daughter."" The girl escapes with the help of said daughter and the chase is on.

This is a way cool flick. It's shot and directed extremely well. Great attention is paid to the landscape. The viewer travels between lush forests, serious waterways with equally serious waterfalls and unforgiving stretches of craggy rocks. Many of he chase sequences are scripted well. Others have been seen way too many times. There are also some aspects of the script that telegraph, way too blatantly, what will happen later on. These things were a bit annoying but other aspects of the script unfolded nicely. Such as how did a woman come to control this group of men? Where did her ""daughter"" come from? Why is her daughter so eager to help a stranger. These all unfold evenly and satisfyingly throughout the movie. These things add depth to the proceedings not often seen in this kind of film.

Even given its faults, this is still a heck of a ride. If you like your action served up in a medieval manner, this will do you good.",1402531200,,1551,4.416083916083916

Ingrid Bols Berdal was one of the best female villains I've seen a long time (Plus, she's HOT).  I'd love to see her in more action flicks.  Isabel Andreasen and Milla Olin are remarkable young actresses.

5622408,3,B00BI6SKYI,"The nightmare of being hunted, especially by someone who should have some sympathy with you, has got to be pretty common. This is what this movie is about. Dagmar is really scary. It's to the movie's credit that she's given a backstory, but it's not one that satisfied me as to why a victimized and nearly lynched woman, who saw her innocent little daughter drowned as a witch, would become the unquestioned leader of a gang of vicious, raping outlaws who keep a teenage girl alive for the purposes of sex slavery/breeding. There are a couple of really unrealistic action sequences as well. I thought a character had committed suicide -- because no one could survive such a fall -- only to see her rise up unbruised and keep going. Really? That's just bad. You might, only just, possibly, survive the initial plunge... but you'd never just be washed up, unharmed, on the rocky shore, able to spring to your feet and just keep running. A point comes, too, when they need outside help and they get it, deus ex machina. Sure, it could happen. But it challenged my suspension of disbelief way too much, and I'm pretty forgiving when my biases are flattered.

I'd give it 2.5 for those flaws. I'll bump it up half a star for the strong girls fighting for themselves and each other, and only for that.",1382140800,,1295,4.581896551724138

life one must come to a decision about being victimized. For me the plots are a reaffirmation
of good over evil- of strength of will over physical threat. Loved it. Primal like Hunger Games.
Pure like Hurt Locker.",1378252800,2,487,4.586206896551724
5622417,4,B00BI6SKYI,I liked this exciting movie- different story line and very well done.  I would highly recommend seeing this- great flick!!!,1378252800,2,123,5.15
5622418,2,B00BI6SKYI,"here's a hint to any future screenwriters:

if your hero(ine) is escaping from her captors and has no equipment, is wearing a dress, and has no food or water, and she somehow manages to kill one of them - SHE SHOULD TAKE EVERYTHING ON THAT BODY.

now put yourself in that mindset and go REWRITE THIS STUPID MOVIE.

also, the acting was not terrible, the plot had potential, and the scenery was fantastic.",1377302400,3,404,4.506849315068493

5622420,4,B00BI6SKYI,"No surprises here but beautiful scenery and a solid chase sequence.  The movie was well worth watching and I would recommend it to any one that likes the ""Most Dangerous Games"" type movie.",1375228800,,188,4.696969696969697
5622421,4,B00BI6SKYI,"Wonderful foreign film! Sometimes you want to veg out and watch something that is just so uniquely entertaining. No big hoopla, blood and guts, apocalyptic, superhero, overly dramatic, dirty politics sexcapades. It's just a pleasurable small Norwegian film with a wonderful premise, fantastic characters, and beautiful visuals. There is action and suspense in the fact that a young girl is trying to escape from her captors, and survive. Her escape is aided by a younger child (the leader Dagmar's so-called daughter) whom she has befriended: they eventually get away together. As the two of them venture into the wilderness trying desperately to outrun their huntsmen abductors, they form a tight sister bond that will definitely assist in their survival.

This movie has all the elements of really good entertainment. (I'm a pushover for subtitled foreign films; they're the best at times when you want to relax!) Thoroughly enjoyed the moderate-action pace, superb acting, beautiful Scandinavian country scenery, and an overall wholesome story. The simplicity of this flick is what makes it so appealing! Highly recommend!",1375142400,,1125,5.428571428571429
5622422,5,B00BI6SKYI,Shows how hate can turn into more hate but how love can overcome all.... The story does show violence and is not intended for young children.,1375142400,,141,4.461538461538462
5622423,5,B00BI6SKYI,A spare but enthralling story set in plague times in Scandenavia.  Unflinchingly brutal and suspenceful but also moving and tender.  Very well acted throughout - one of the best movies Ive seen in some time.,1374192000,6,207,4.885714285714286
5622424,4,B00BI6SKYI,"I really enjoyed the characters. It had a good pace. The villain lady was convincing. Just enough ""gore"", nothing extreme. Good story about two orphaned girls escaping the clutches of a nice woman gone rogue. I felt bad for the villain herself, she was just never able to let go of her pain.",1373587200,3,291,4.509433962264151

8568859,4,B00BI6SKYI,IT A FAIR MOVIE TO WATCH,1509926400,,24,3.1666666666666665
8568860,5,B00BI6SKYI,This is an excellent movie.  I recommend watching it with the Norwegian language setting with English subtitles.  The true voice and language of the villain female lead is very important as it adds a more sinister tone to her character.  I first saw this on Netflix and wanted to see it again so I bought it.  I started to watch it with English voice overs and it takes away from it too much.  Excellent story line and high drama unfolds.  No boring moments.,1501632000,,458,4.457831325301205

8568862,5,B00BI6SKYI,"This movie starts slow and builds. I bought it because I had watched it over and over on streaming and decided to add it to my library. It is just as good without the subtitles as with, and if you listen carefully, you can almost understand the speech, it being a form of Saxon that English is akin to from very olden times. Its rich with scenery and character. Something you will watch more than once.",1487808000,,402,4.302631578947368
8568863,5,B00BI6SKYI,"This movie is great.  It's got Ingrid Berdal who's in HBO's Westworld. What a great actor -she makes a great villain!  This movie is not necessarily any kind of amazing feat of storytelling, but that being said, it's a solid revenge tale with terrific acting, beautiful scenery (Scandanavia!), and exciting action sequences.  It is subtitled, but I don't mind that.  I believe that it has an option for those that like to watch their movies dubbed.  If you dig Viking movies with strong female leads, you should pick this film up.",1479859200,,530,4.78021978021978
8568864,5,B00BI6SKYI,"Very engaging tale from the Dark Ages in Norway...great scenic cinematography, a sparse storyline matched well with a rather barren and wild countryside...wonderful acting from all the principle characters, but in particular Isabel Christine Andreasen and Milla Olin as Signe and Frigg respectively...great movie and a well told tale of a much darker time, when humanity almost lost what it meant to be human...",1475452800,,411,5.4375
