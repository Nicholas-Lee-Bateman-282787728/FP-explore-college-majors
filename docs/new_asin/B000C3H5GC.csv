8095492,5,B000C3H5GC,Loved it but I think it would have been nice to see the tables get turned on the rapist,1448236800,,87,3.6315789473684212
8095493,1,B000C3H5GC,"Not a film so much as a series of bad special-effects tests, all filmed in slow-motion and overdubbed with nonsense. I could not discern an actual plot, the gore is very amateurish, and the title sequence presents a different name. Unless you're stupid, not worth your time in any way.",1361318400,5,285,4.72

8095495,5,B000C3H5GC,"I recommend this for friends, family, and Christians with even a hint of a sense of humour. Freedom of media at its best.",1237420800,9,121,4.304347826086956
8095496,1,B000C3H5GC,"Okay, for starters if you're a fan of sexploitation sleaze, you just about have to buy a film named like this, don't you?  I mean, you know there are going to be some problems just from the box cover, a drawing (from a website advertised in the flick) of a naked young girl in a middle-east like scene carrying a cross with whipmarks on her bum.  Uh, okay, but that can't possibly have anything to do with the film, eh?  Another problem might be that it supposedly won the ""Tales of Woe"" film festival, which so far as I can find doesn't exist.

Well, nevermind, like I said, someone has to buy this and review it solely due to the title, even though there's a strong possibility that it could be some student art flick with the title pasted on later . . . which of course it is.  In fact the disk doesn't even bother to disguise the fact that the real name of this wreck is ""Into Thy Hands"".  Apparently they couldn't even bother to edit the video to match the box.  After some more drawings, with more in the so-called ""bonus feature"", the embarrasment begins, which is basically an ultra short and ultra cheap semi-slasher flick with no pay offs.  The continuity is laughable, like when the bearded killer wastes 30 seconds getting a rope unsnarled while the camera runs.

There is some nudity and some sleaze scenes that might have been half decent if they weren't filmed in slow motion with no sound.  Oh, did I forget?  There's a sludgy background music track but no actual sound recording at all.  R-rated bondage gets practically no respect at all these days, what with it plastered all over usenet and the web, so that nets this mess the minimum one star.  For joke collectors only.",1135987200,106,1691,4.469055374592834
