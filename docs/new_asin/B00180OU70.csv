I just love the outlandish central conceit of a vintage cereal restaurant, in which the cereal becomes a metaphor for our youthful, untarnished, and yet dysfunctional selves.  With a witty, intelligent screenplay and a seriously good cast, it starts out incredibly strong and as quirky as they come (in a good way).  I only gave four stars because for me the second half of the film lost its unique flavor and became more of a cliche, but I still think it rocks.",1210291200,14,577,4.637254901960785
3176649,4,B00180OU70,"This unremittingly cheery movie has a decent cast, headed by Zooey Deschanel and Aaron Stanford as girlfriend and boyfriend.  I don't think the plot is even meant to be realistic, but it is set in New Orleans [it took me a while to figure that out] and the guy is working at a breakfast store which serves an incredible number of cereals [many of them no longer in production] while aspiring to be a rock musician.  His girlfriend loses her job and he suggests she move in with him, which she does.  She then however proposes that he hire her to work at the storewhich would also give him more time [and much less excuses] to finish recording tracks for a CD.  He doesnt want to do it and it seems he has the musicians equivalent of writers cramp a creative block; perhaps just a fear of failure.  The main theme of the film is their relationship: her efforts to get him to grow up and make a decision, as she puts it: Whether you really are a musician temporarily working in a cereal store, or a cereal store manager who dabbles in music.  Adding spice are: a potential business and romantic rival; the goofy older store owner who acts like someone who did way too many drugs for too long; an elderly, failed lawyer, and a few other store clients and would-be musicians.

This movie is cute.  The levels of satire get a bit complex: the movie perhaps mocks those who mock consumerism by pretending to worship it; but at the core its a growing-up and relationship movie unencumbered by any substantial downers.  Its also pretty much unencumbered by nudity, vulgarity or any violence; therefore if it had a rating it would probably be PG-13.  I give it a B-.

Pasty faced, greasy haired, wimpy main character (Aaron Stanford) could not be anymore lightweight or any less engaging. Christopher Lloyd just plays Jim from Taxi --again. Not one believable moment in this movie. Legal arbitration hearing at the end is especially ridiculous. Would be absurd even in a made for Disney Channel movie.",1401148800,,644,5.0754716981132075

3176655,4,B00180OU70,"This movie just might be used for business classes in college to show how businesses and competition works! A guy runs a bar that serves nothing but cereal and where a loyal and eccentric clientele eats all the time as he considers launching a career as a rock musician, which his girlfriend constanly chides him for not working hard enough at. When he won't hire her at the bar, and an entrepreneur steals his concept and opens up a new, larger, and fancier store across the street, she joins the new place, and an all-out war begins!

This DVD features good extras, sound quality, and other things to make this a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I recommend it.",1373846400,2,663,4.666666666666667

3176657,4,B00180OU70,"This is a fun little indie film. I did not have huge expectations, but bought it because the price was right (less than 5 bucks!), and because I am a fan of ""New Girl"" Zooey Deschanel. But mostly because of the fact that I am a huge fan of breakfast cereals. It was great to see that they researched the topic a little, and there are numerous famous old cereals making an appearance in the film. It's a little unrealistic in terms of the fact that the manager of Flakes (a hipster hangout restaurant that serves only breakfast cereal) purchases 30-year old unopened boxes of cereals that are no longer made (at a fraction of what they'd be valued at by cereal box collectors) and then OPENS THEM AND SERVES THEM TO CUSTOMERS.  I mean seriously, would you eat breakfast cereal that was 30 years old like Quake or Freakies? Not to mention that unopened boxes of these cereals are as scarce as hen's teeth -- you certainly couldn't run a restaurant depending on discovering old unopened boxes of the stuff, not to mention what you'd have to charge for a bowl of it in order to make a profit, even if it was safe to sell to the public (I wonder what the Health Department would say about selling 30 year old breakfast cereal).

But this is just picking nits, and you really shouldn't get too bogged down in the logical details of the plot. Bottom line, it's a fun little movie, as long as your expectations are not too high. Zooey Deschanel is enchanting as always, and Christopher Lloyd heads a cast of colorful quirky characters. I wasn't familiar with Aaron Stanford's previous work but he was good in this. The music soundtrack was just OK (your mileage may vary) - not great but not annoyingly intrusive either.",1332374400,,1712,4.519354838709678

Overall the story line sticks to skiing and not too much verbage -- who wants to talk about skiing, let's just see some!  Besides, unless you're Warren Miller, skiers in general do not make the greatest commentators.

According to financial records released by the studio, Michael Lehmann`s ""Flakes"" raked in all of $778 in box office revenue when it was released in late 2007.  And although one hates to kick a well-intentioned, low budget film when it's down, the truth is that ""Flakes"" is a cute idea that doesn't really amount to all that much in the long run.  In fact, the film is so benign and innocuous that it seems to be evaporating even as you're watching it.

Neal Downs (Aaron Stanford) is a struggling musician who works as manager of a little New Orleans eatery called Flakes (owned by Christopher Lloyd) that serves nothing but cold cereal to its loyal clientele.  When a rival franchise opens up across the street, Neal's girlfriend, the self-named Pussy Katz (Zooey Deschanel), applies for a job at the new establishment as a means of getting back at Neal for refusing to hire her at his own place.

The pro-capitalist vs. anti-capitalist theme that runs through the storyline is halfhearted and underdeveloped at best.  Moreover, while the cast is engaging and appealing (especially Deschanel), the undernourished Chris Poche/Karey Kirkpatrick screenplay doesn't give the actors a whole lot of solid material to work with.  And even the relatively fresh and novel New Orleans setting isn't exploited as much as it could be for its old-world atmosphere and charm.",1255564800,,1370,4.978070175438597

Chris LLoyd is very good as an aging hippie who owns ""FLAKES"".
A neo-yuppie opens a competitive carbon-copy store across the New Orleans street and the drama ensues. Well-written, quirky and funny movie. Highly recommended.",1241568000,6,523,5.011494252873563

Only Pussy Katz doesn't seem to agree, and wants more from both their relationship and Neal himself!

What happens when a budding capitalist comes to town and opens his own brand of Flakes just across the street? Chaos ensues!

Flakes is a great light, comedic indie gem, that hits the head on the nail so completely it's almost hard to believe. I can just imagine driving over to Silverlake or Echo Park and walking into any of those bohemian, artistic eateries to see exact copies of these fictional characters. This film captures the feelings and actions of how so many of us young grown-ups do in these modern times; dreaming for more, too lazy to change anything, unsure of our own decisions yet so unwilling to change for even those we love.

This one will stand up well to repeat viewings, which ultimately is the supreme test for any film. Enjoy!",1217548800,12,801,4.970149253731344
8268182,1,B00180OU70,"Seriously tedious slacker comedy about an annoying wannabe musician (an insufferable Aaron Stanford) who works in a hipster cereal store called Flakes rather than actually complete his music demos.  He would rather rip an actual performing band and self-righteously proclaim that he won't put out anything until it's mind blowing and perfect than make any music of his own.  His girlfriend (Zooey Deschanel) keeps trying to convince him to hire her for a week, work on his music during that time and finish his demos but he persistently refuses so she decides to work for a competing cereal store across the street and put Flakes out of business in the hope her boyfriend will finally do something with his music.

Maybe if you're twenty and can actually identify with these characters they don't seem so unbelievably annoying.  I even had trouble tolerating the normally reliable Zooey Deschanel in this one--her character's heart is in the right place but she isn't ultimately all that much more likable than her boyfriend.

I didn't find Flakes amusing or sweet or charming or really anything other than extremely annoying to the point where watching it was virtually intolerable.  Flakes is a stale and soggy waste of time.",1496707200,,1227,5.019704433497537

8268185,3,B00180OU70,"This little indie, while uneven, certainly entertained me and made me glad I watched it.  I have worked through most of the Zooey Deschanel back list, which explains why I sought out this little known, little watched film.  It took in what might be a record $778 dollars at the box office.  I don't know of a film with a smaller gross.  Too bad too as this makes for a pleasant and watchable film.  Even for those who do not have a crush on Zooey.
  This un-rated film tells of a New Orleans musician who hasn't quite got the umph to carry out his music.  He (Aaron Standford) manages a restaurant that serves only boxed cereal, an odd concept.  His girlfriend (Zooey) is a painter, an artist who also has not found her fame.  She pushes him to be the best musician that he can be.  He has the usual fears about growing up.  What makes the film fun is watching Standford (TV, also Pyro in the X-Men films), Zooey and of course Christopher Lloyd do their bits.
  Director Michael Lehman has done such popular, quirky films as Heathers, Air Heads and The Truth about Cats and Dogs, all of which were much more successful than Flakes.
  Polish born actress Izabella Miko, a seasoned pro with some 42 large and small screen credits has a supporting role.
  This fun, predicable film deserved a lot more box office than it got.  There are lesser rom/coms that have done a great deal better.  Give it a try, I think you will enjoy it..",1470787200,,1429,4.402298850574713
