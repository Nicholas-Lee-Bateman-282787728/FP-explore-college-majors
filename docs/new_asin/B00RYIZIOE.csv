6936542,5,B00RYIZIOE,"Tom Rush has always been a very appealing performer. That comes across in this well-done dvd. If you've enjoyed his music over the years, you'll like this DVD. Lots of humorous and interesting tales about his career, other musicians, his personal life, the Boston scene and the great folk music scare of the early 1960s.",1437523200,,320,4.836363636363636
6936543,5,B00RYIZIOE,"How come when you cry for a very long time, you sometimes break out into a laugh? Maybe it's because they're the two ends of the same thread. Tom Rush weaves that thread through the fabric of our lives, with such easy grace. If you care anything about music, if you care about the laughs and tears of your own life, don't miss this DVD.",1425168000,2,336,4.184615384615385
6936544,5,B00RYIZIOE,"A few years ago in an earlier 1960s folk minute nostalgia fit I did a series of reviews of male folk-singers entitled Not Bob Dylan. That series asked two central questions-why did those folk singers not challenge Dylan whom the media of the day had crowned king of the folk minute for supremacy in the smoky (then) coffeehouse night and, if they had not passed on, were they still working the smoke-free church basement, homemade cookies and coffee circuit that constitutes the remnant of that folk minute even in the old hotbeds like Cambridge and Boston. Were they still singing and song-writing, that pairing of singer and writer having been becoming more prevalent, especially in the folk milieu in the wake of Bob Dylans word explosions back then. The ground was shifting under the Tin Pan Alley kingdom.

Here is the general format for asking and answering those two questions which still apply today if one is hell-bent on figuring out the characters who rose and fell during that time:

If I were to ask someone, in the year 2010 as I have done periodically, to name a male folk singer from the 1960s I would assume that if I were to get an answer to that question that the name would be Bob Dylan. And that would be a good and appropriate choice. One can endlessly dispute whether or not Dylan was (or wanted to be) the voice of the Generation of 68 (so named for the fateful events of that watershed year when those who tried to turn the world upside down to make it more livable began to feel that the movement was reaching some ebb tide) but in terms of longevity and productivity, the never-ending touring until this day and releasing of X amount of bootleg recordings, he fits the bill as a known quality. However, there were a slew of other male folk singers who tried to find their niche in the folk milieu and who, like Dylan, today continue to produce work and to perform. The artist under review, Tom Rush, is one such singer/songwriter.

The following is a question that I have been posing in reviewing the work of a number of male folk singers from the 1960s and it is certainly an appropriate question to ask of Tom Rush as well. I do not know if Tom Rush, like his contemporary Bob Dylan, started out wanting to be the king of the hill among male folk singers but he certainly had some things going for him. A decent acoustic guitar but a very interesting (and strong baritone) voice to fit the lyrics of love, hope, and longing that he was singing about at the time. During much of this period along with his own songs he was covering other artists, particularly Joni Mitchell, so it is not clear to me that he had that same Dylan drive by lets say 1968.

As for the songs themselves I mentioned that he covered Joni Mitchell in this period. A very nice version of Urge For Going that captures the wintry, got to get out of here, imaginary that Joni was trying to evoke about things back in her Canadian homeland. And the timelessness and great lyrical sense of his No Regrets, as the Generation of 68 sees another generational cycle starting, as is apparent now if it was not then. The covers of fellow Cambridge folk scene fixture Eric Von Schmidt on Joshua Gone Barbados and Galveston Flood are well done. As is the cover of Bukka Whites Panama Limited (although you really have to see or hear old Bukka flailing away on his old beat up National guitar to get the real thing on YouTube).

Whether Tom Rush had the fire back then is a mute question now although in watching the documentary under review, No Regrets, in which he tells us about his life from childhood to the very recent past at some point he did lose the flaming burn down the building fire, just got tired of the road like many, many other performers and became a top-notch record producer, a gentleman farmer, and returned to the stage, most dramatically with his annual show Tom Rush-The Club 47 Tradition Continues held at Symphony Hall in Boston each winter. And in this documentary appropriately done under the sign of no regrets in which tells Toms take on much that happened then he takes a turn, an important oral tradition turn, as folk historian.

He takes us, even those of us who were in the whirl of some of it back then to those key moments when we were looking for something rooted, something that would make us pop in the red scare Cold War night of the early 1960s. Needless to say the legendary Club 47 in Cambridge gets plenty of attention as does his own fitful start in getting his material recorded, the continuing struggle from what he said. Other coffeehouses and other performers of the time, especially Eric Von Schmidt get a nod of recognition and does the role of key folk FJ Dick Summer in show-casing new work (and the show where I started to pick up my life-long folk habit). So if you want to remember those days when you sought refuse in the coffeehouses and church basements, sought a cheap date night or, ouch, want to know why your parents are still playing Joshuas Gone Barbados on the record player as you go out the door Saturday night watch this film.",1421712000,6,5085,4.4978354978354975
8696320,5,B00RYIZIOE,"I have enjoyed this gentleman's music for so many years. It's a pleasure to have this intimate biography into Tom's life and times, which, he has made sure to explain is still a work in progress.
I listen to Tom, and I get the urge for goin, the urge for goin to any performance I might be lucky enough to find and attends.
Having lived for several years in the same neck 'o the woods, I am buoyed, however unjustified, by his New Hampshire context, and Merrimack County was one of the LP's I played the most during the early 70's.
Tom is timeless, honest, humble, humorous, friendly, skillful, accessible, warm and now, kinda fuzzy too.
I'm a man, but he brings a tear to my eye every time. That's real artistry, in my opinion.",1534204800,,728,4.4
8696321,5,B00RYIZIOE,"I'm so happy I found this! I've been a Tom Rush fan since the '60s, but I didn't know much about his background until now.

What a great talent, and he sounds as good as ever. On top of that, he's funny! I understand he's also a really nice guy.

If you're a fan, I definitely recommend watching this movie.",1503792000,,307,4.1
8696322,4,B00RYIZIOE,Been a fan since the 60's!  This was a great bio of a Trailblazer for the Singer/Songwriter of the era.  Tom still has that great voice and distinctive sound.  Cool to watch his evolution and ability to navigate through the Music Business.  He is a great talent.,1486944000,,262,4.51063829787234
