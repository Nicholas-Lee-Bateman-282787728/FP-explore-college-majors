8543677,3,B000OFOLOM,I love Lidia and her show but to only put 4 episodes per disk is a waste. Why not make a box set with more episodes per disk. Its too expensive to get the entire set on DVD when you have to buy so many at an expensive cost each. Very disappointing way to market a product.,1411430400,,272,3.789473684210526
