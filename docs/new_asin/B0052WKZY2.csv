4531954,4,B0052WKZY2,"""Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale"" is a warped holiday vision, an action movie with a touch of horror flick, set in Finland's Lapland by writer and director Jalmari Helander, who draws on the Finnish legend that Father Christmas dwells in the Korvatunturi mountain on the Russian border. A foreign businessman is drilling into Korvatunturi, ostensibly to collect geological samples. In fact, he's looking for an ancient burial ground, and his efforts to uncover it will exact a high price. On the Finnish side of the border, Rauno (Jorma Tommila) and his young son Pietari (Onni Tommila) join Piiparinen (Peeter Jakobi), Aimo (Tommi Korpela), and his son Juuso (Ilmari Jrvenp) for the annual reindeer hunt that provides their living. But all the reindeer have already been killed, the community's children and radiators stolen, and a strange old man has fallen into Rauno's illegal wolf trap.

Young Pietari is the hero. He has become convinced that Santa Claus is actually a demonic creature that devours naughty children, and he suspects that Santa has been unleashed by the excavation of Korvatunturi. We suspect that his imagination has run away with him. Pietari lives in poverty in a frozen wilderness with his gruff but caring father. The boy carries a stuffed animal named Vuppe on a leash with him everywhere, evidence that the family cannot afford a dog, I suppose. Evidence also of Pietari's insecurity, for which he consoles himself with Vuppe. I'm not sure that Pietari has a strong enough personality to carry this film, but the adult actors are all terrific. They impart the necessary seriousness to completely bizarre activities, so that we can buy into this story. It's strange, comically absurd, and often gruesome, but ""A Christmas Tale"" is a holiday film like no other. In Finnish with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Oscilloscope 2011): There are 2 short films, 3 featurettes, a Photo Gallery of 36 behind-the-scenes photos, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). ""Rare Exports, Inc."" (7 min) is the original film about a species of Father Christmases that the men train to be civilized Santas. It was made for the Woodpecker Films web site in 2003. ""Rare Exports, Inc.: The Official Safety Instructions"" (9 min), produced for film festivals in 2005, was a second installment in the series, this time about how to safely handle the Father Christmases and what to do if they get out of control. Both short films are narrated in English but have scant Finnish dialogue. ""The Making of Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale"" (30 min) is a meandering look behind the scenes with the actors and director and, finally, the sound designer. ""Blood in the Snow: A Look at the Concept Art"" (3 min) features drawings by Pekka Veikkolainen followed by the corresponding scene from the film. ""Animatics and Computer Effects Comparison"" (6 min) offers before and after the digital effects were added for 2 sequences. Subtitles available in English and English SDH.",1322265600,4,2963,5.044897959183674
4531955,4,B0052WKZY2,"I saw a trailer for it that featured something being dug up from the ice. At first I thought it was going to be a story like ""The Thing"", but then the trailer mentioned...""we have Santa Clause"".  WHAT?! So I had to see this.

This film kept my interest throughout, since I had little idea which direction it would go. Besides the interesting ""origin"" of the ""Jolly Fellow"", I loved the scenery. and the seeming bleakness of the characters' lives.  They seem to be in the middle of nowhere. And of course, the elves.

The subdued relationship between the father and the boy, and the father's quiet anguish over the financial loss represented by the deer (and perhaps also by the statement that the gingerbread was ""as good as mom used to make)-so near to Christmas-affected me as well.

I saw the ending as a way for that small group to offer a type of joy to the rest of the world...although at some profit to themselves.

As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is related to two previous short films that can be found online (and which are included on the DVD). In my opinion, this film is a prequel to those short films. I agree with other reviewers about not seeing the shorts first. I hadn't, and so the film surprised me more. The short films are more tongue-in-cheek, but still have some potentially disturbing images.

There are some moments of dark humor, but this is NOT a lighthearted film overall. There are moments of violence and gore--so be warned. Just because some titles include ""Christmas"" do not expect this to be a children's film, or even a ""family"" film.

I enjoyed it.",1322092800,4,1597,4.559440559440559
4531956,4,B0052WKZY2,Dark humor. Really dark humor. So dark some won't even recognize it as humor. Plus a child action hero. And Santa Clause. And elves. And the triumphant capitalist exploitation of a downtrodden minority.,1322006400,4,202,5.151515151515151
4531957,5,B0052WKZY2,"This little gem gets off to a familiar start: some moneyed power learns an ancient secret, un-knowing workers open the site, and a terrible force is unleashed. (Hey, it worked for Alien and The Mummy.) This time, though, the buried demon is Santa Claus. This isn't the jolly, ho-ho-ho santa of our disneyfied era. Instead, this demon dates back to times when terrors roamed the night. And he comes with elves ...

All of which lead up to a major change in mood toward the end, when this turns into a laugh-out-loud comedy - but saying more would say too much. American viewers might find a few things jarring, like a cute little boy who goes everywhere with his stuffed teddy and a shotgun, but seems true to the Finnish hunting culture that the movie portrays. Also, the director has held back from obvious opportunities for wild effects, to the benefit of the movie's brooding mood and dark charm.

This isn't one for the smallest kids. Still, it seems destined to become a Christmas staple for years to come, and a welcome change to the buckets of saccharine we usually see. I give this my highest recommendation.

4531958,2,B0052WKZY2,"Having read in a review that this movie may one day be up on the shelf alongside IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS STORY upon its having become part of the traditional Holiday film-fare, my interest in knowing more about RARE EXPORTS was naturally piqued.  I am always on the lookout for something new.  So I up and bought this - and like the one-star reviewer on these boards - I am disgusted that I did.

I have only myself to blame.  Fervently believing that ideally one should know as little about it as possible before watching a movie or reading a book or approaching any work of art for that matter - believing that a work of art should be entered upon the way one would enter a new town or walk down a new street or even enter into a new romantic relationship, and fully realizing that nothing or everything could happen - well, with these artistic principals I have stepped into alot of crap along my life journey...but I've also been transported to rich and rewarding other realsm - rarely, to be sure, but wonderfully when magic does happen.  Speaking of crap, limiting what I know about any given film before seeing it is something like a crap shoot.  But life is the biggest crap shoot of all - and so Life imitates Art and vice versa.

POTENTIAL SPOLIER ALERT AHEAD: The thing about this movie is that close to 2/3rds truly and wonderfully transported me.  I never knew squat about arctic Finland before - and as presented here it is a beautiful and brutal place. Acting, cinematography, atmosphere and ambiance are all poetically captured and backed by a gripping but not great music score.  And the slowly emerging storyline is absolutely captivating and mesmerizing.  Because the fantastic premise of the film is so gradually presented and in such a matter-of-fact, realistic fashion, one can easily buy into and believe the yarn un-reeling before our eyes.  I was so caught up in the inner truth of the film that a small voice in me kept saying ""Don't mess up"" - as movies often do.  Well, this one did manage to make a mess.  And the reason the film quickly unravelled - at about the point where the hockey-helmeted lad sees the big warehouse with the number 25 on it - is because the makers of the film stopped believing in their own tale.  They pulled the plug on the utterly mysterious and mystic other-world reality they were meticulously creating...and yielded to their worst instincts and instead gave us, in the end, only another movie.  For so many almost inexcusable reasons the last third pulls down and tanks the entirety, like the whole beautiful, majestic Titanic before pulled down into the icy black waters and out of existence by the damage to the front of its hull.  How is it that the hockey-helmeted lad suddenly knows everything and takes charge of things more like a Finnish Rambo than like the little boy we had so carefully come to know and like?  How is it that his stern yet loving Dad who had watched the boy's every move in the expository part of the film suddenly could care less it seems that the kid is flying off into a CGI sky and landscape atop a CGI bag of boys that is affixed to a helicopter's runners?  And the idiotic ending wherein we finally get to know what the intriguing title means - well, at that point I sighed in vast disappointment and popped the DVD from its tray.

CONTINUED SPOILER ALERT:  With a Kubrickian leisure the film builds to a convincing and surreal confrontation betwixt the boy's father and friends and the what-is-it in the butchery. It is a truly fabulous and fantastic scene. The movie is poised at that moment to continue to believe in itself and offer the world something immense in its world-view, something that might make this film the earth-bound equivalent of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.  But, as noted above, at this critical juncture the movie becomes merely a movie.  It races towards the silly denouement like a snowball rolling faster and faster down a hill, increasing its momentum and its mass with all sorts of banal and unconvincing movie magic.  And that phony magic is in such sharp contrast to the gripping realities presented before that instead of awesume the film becomes sadly awful.

In brief, this movie will never sit on the same shelf with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or A CHRISTMAS STORY.  Matter-of-fact it will spend this winter on the Island of Misfit Movies in a big box of other DVD disappointments that I will try to sell at a summer garage sale. That is known as ""passing the buck"" in more ways than one.",1320710400,12,4527,4.593788819875776
4531959,5,B0052WKZY2,"We saw this film at our local cinema, not knowing anything about it. From the opening moments we were gripped and engaged by a wonderful combination I have never experienced in a movie before: interplays of mythology, environment, politics. We left the film with our jaws still dropped. It's beautifully produced, amazingly authentic acting, and like nothing else you will see. The story line is very human and ultimately inspiring.

Unbeknownst to them, he is an ancient, evil spirit punishing naughty children. Rare Exports is a dark and clever horror tale with a minimalistic plot, decent performances, and a thrilling atmosphere. Lacking common horror movie tropes, this independent feature shines because of its witty plot and its great use of music to highlight the more thrilling scenes.

4531989,3,B0052WKZY2,"I saw the title and thought, ""Why haven't I heard of this movie before?"", it looked like it was right up my alley!
The trailer made it look like it was a real horror Christmas movie, and it was, until a point when it wasn't any longer.
I loved the premise for the movie I thought I was about to watch.
Also, I love Swedish/Nordic type movies, they have a way with movies that others could (usually) learn from.

A little more than half of the movie (the first part) my wife and I both agreed that this was something special, it had blood, creepiness, hundreds of old NUDE men (!!!) :) and intrigue, it had it all for a Christmas movie that should be rated *R*. (the F-word was even said, which is odd for a movie about Christmas and children)
Out of nowhere it turned into a children's Christmas movie, I mean, right after the 'shower' scene it did this... (You may think I am hung up on the shower scene, but really, if you see it you will understand the (almost) disbelief with this scene and the last half of the movie)
I loved the ADULT part of the first half, I mean, it was a really well written horror movie that was really different than the rest out there, for years even.
I didn't love the ending part where it turns into a children's show, I mean like it was done by a flick of a switch, it happened that fast.

Since I don't want to screw up the movie for anyone, (it's still worth watching to most) I can't say what I would like to.

I am not saying, ""Don't watch it!"", I am only saying, ""What in the heck were the writers, producers, and the directors thinking?""...
(I'm not being prudish at all, I am thinking it was two movies that were found and placed together at the last minute, that's what I am thinking! Not really, but that's how it almost comes across)

I am 65 and my wife is 63, we BOTH love horror/sci-fi movies (if they are well done) and we BOTH loved the first part, at the last half we were BOTH looking at each other and wondering, ""WTH?"". I may be old, but I am not an old man that shouts, ""You kids get out of my yard!"", if you know what I mean. :)

I gave it 3 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the first part, the second part, not so much. Maybe this would be a 2-1/2 star movie.",1515456000,,2216,4.12037037037037

4532002,5,B0052WKZY2,"I normally hate anything with subtitles. So when a friend recommended this film to me I was skeptical. However I watched the entire thing and loved every minute of it. Despite it's hokey premise they managed to make an extremely well crafted, well acted, and gripping Horror Drama. When I heard evil santa and evil elves, I figured schlock that might be good for a laugh, but this is a legitimate horror flick with a great surprise ending.

4532003,5,B0052WKZY2,"What a great horror movie!  Suspense, foreboding and fear, not gallons of gore drive this Finnish made movie.  Most of the spoken lines are in Finnish but the English subtitles are easy to read and did not distract me from enjoying the movie.  Set in a small village and farm in the  Finnish Lappland wilderness, the movie explores geography and customs not well known in the U.S.  The Finns say, and I believe that they are correct, that Northern Finland is the last great wilderness in western  Europe. The Lapps and some other hardy people make it their home but an unprepared or just unlucky person could easily die there in the winter.

I noticed a review and an involved discussion about this movie and pedophilia.  The review and subsequent discussion includes claims and counter claims involving nudity and the training of Santa Clauses by having children sit in the trainees laps.  As a retired law enforcement intelligence analyst and investigator, as well as being the father of a nine year old girl, I am extremely sensitive to any hint of child abuse.  I saw nothing in this movie which even hinted at pedophilia.  The only nudity which I remember is a brief scene in which the new Santas are scrubbed down in group with no children present.  Some people in the discussion claim that Finns have a more casual attitude toward nudity than do Americans.  I can testify from personal experience that this is true, particularly regarding sauna, bathing, swimming and similar activities.  As a group, Finns are also highly moral people with what is, in most years, the lowest crime rate in the world.",1514332800,3,1607,4.77536231884058

It's just a story: a good, old-fashioned tale such as we used to be enjoy in our literature. Enjoy it for that; that's all it is.

P.S. On the comment that the entire cast is boys and men: who cares? It's not teaching any social messages, and it's not American. Let it be what it is and grow up.

As an adult it is indeed an unreal story, however it is one of those that will draw you into it's fantasy. The chemistry between Jorma and Onni Tommila, whom I speculate are father and son in real life, brings an emotional element that brings it all together.

It's not for everyone, of course, but it's hard to not enjoy it for what it is: simply one crazy ride to the darker side of Christmas.",1507766400,,365,4.304347826086956
4532050,4,B0052WKZY2,"I was not only shocked, but pleasantly surprised at this extremely unusual take on holiday-themed thriller. Not only is the subject matter unsettling - the Nordic/Germanic roots of Santa Claus is not the cuddly ""Coca Cola"" version as is pointed out in the film - but it's genuinely funny at times.

While you shouldn't expect the belly laughs you get in the witty ""Shaun of the Dead,"" this film will have enough cute twists on what you THINK Christmas is supposed to be that the tongue-in-cheek humor is undeniable.

""Rare Exports"" (a title that will make perfect sense at the end of the film) begins with an Anglo masked archaeological dig on the Finnish-Russian boarder. The aim of the dig is quickly revealed (with subsequent scenes) as the rediscovery of a lifeform that isn't necessarily dead. A couple of area kids witness the opening stages of the dig, one of them does his best inform his Dad and others, but being a kid, he's ignored. Even the friend with him thinks he's overreacting.

Although I'd love to elaborate on what the culmination of the film is, it's really difficult to tell you much more about the movie without spoiling it for you. If you're into fun, imaginative films and you don't mind the foreboding dread hanging over the tiny Finnish town, I guarantee you'll find ""Rare Exports"" an engaging, fun and surprising film that doesn't take it self too seriously or become bogged down in violence and gore. I've never seen anything like it.",1506988800,,1463,4.751968503937008

I'm not going to say much about the story because it's kind of complex and more then a little confusing.
I will say, however, that it was entertaining (if a little strange), and worth checking out if you like REALLY odd movies.  I found the lack of full captions a little annoying and sometimes there are portions with no captions at all, but it's still a fun and very different film that seems like very few people know about.

I was totally enthralled by watching Pietari and the hunters' journey to uncover the truth about Santa Claus and the strange happenings surrounding their Finnish village. I would like to think that Pietari's transition from childhood to adulthood during the course of this film is a gritty version of a coming-of-age story set around Christmas time.

Recommend to kids who are old enough to handle violence, gore and nudity this movie throw at them. If you are looking for a underrated dark Christmas film, definitively check this movie out!

4532088,4,B0052WKZY2,"Pietari and his father live in Lapland, Finland where they slaughter reindeer to feed themselves and sell to survive on. A big corporation is drilling on top of Korvatunturi, a fell nearby, and ruining their business. The herd of reindeer that usually provides them for their whole year's income is found rotting, obviously killed by mad wolves. Pietari sees some evidence of it being done by people and knows that Santa is behind it all. He knows that Santa isn't the benelovent giver of gifts everyone thinks he is. No one listens to him because he is young, but he will fights as hard as he can to protect his family and the life they have built together.

Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale is a dark fairy tale featuring the most adorable child, Pietari. He is often mocked by others and is seen as a weakling. His only semblance of a friend is Juuso, who is a couple of years older and cruel to him. His mother is absent and his father is emotionally distant. Whatever happened seems to have been recent and his father still hurts, but reacts to this by separating himself from Pietari rather than sharing their feelings. This isolated boy tries his best, but usually acts as a hinderance to those around him. This all changes when Juuso tells him there is no Santa Claus. Pietari goes into Buffy-esque research mode with a bunch of books he just happens to have around the house. He discovers that Santa is a sham and he beats children in addition to other unspeakable things. The illustrations in these books are amazing and morbid, featuring a more Krampus-like figure beating children and Santa on top of a pile of children's skulls.

When things start going bad, Pietari is the only one to look at the evidence. He, Juuso, and the other children cut a hole in a fence to spy on the Korvatunturi drilling operation, so he blames himself for basically destroying their future. Then he sees bare human footprints around the carcasses and knows it was Santa Claus. He sets out to fight as best he can, preparing by wearing protective hockey gear, carrying around his father's rifle, and taping cardboard to his bottom. Pietari completely changes from a boy frightened by his father's slaughtering business to one brave enough to confront powerful creatures and even when all seems lost. His relationship with his distant father completely flips as Pietari becomes the protector of and fighter for his father.

The creatures in the film are not what Pietari or anyone else expected. The old nude men seen around are not Santa; they are more like his elves, doing his bidding by kidnapping the local children and stealing anything that emits heat. They are pretty much indestructable, surviving a tiger trap, beatings, torture, and other abuse. Santa is trapped in a giant block of ice. Only his giant horns are seen and everything else is hidden beneath the ice. Even though it's is never mentioned by name, this Santa seems more like Krampus, the dark punishing side of Santa. The crew working around the ice block received new safety instructions that included no drinking, cursing, swearing, or smoking, all things that could incur Santa's wrath and disturb his slumber.

Rare Exports: A Christmas Story is a more whimsical story that undermines the view we typically have of Santa Claus. The overall tone of the film is more positive and hopeful than most films like it. The core of the film is the relationship between Pietari and his father which is strengthened over the course of the story. The ending is awesome and unexpected (although it is more disturbing if you think about it too much). The whole story is elevated by the beautiful visuals of the icy Finnish countryside. This is one of the few feel good Christmas horror films and it's highly recommended.",1482969600,,3772,4.7629969418960245

4532092,4,B0052WKZY2,"This is the second time Ive viewed this film, the first having been during its brief tour in U.S. art cinemas just after it came out.

It is a dark, zany, somewhat satirical story about an archaeological dig in northern Finland that uncovers a Saint Nick who just ain't what we thought!  Pietari, a young boy and the hero of the film, substantiates Saint Nick's dark background by researching it in several library books. He learns that whenever Saint Nick is involved, horrible things happen to children! Pietaris friends begin to disappear without a trace, and ....  But you must see the rest of the story yourself. And I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

Children may be not be prepared for this dark view of Santa, the film's graphic gore, and scenes with numerous naked bodies. (Parents in the U.S. may be especially irate about the naked bodies!  ;-)  )  So I consider it best for ages 12 plus.

4532104,4,B0052WKZY2,"If you're looking for an unconventional Christmas movie, you'll get it with ""Rare Exports"". Made for less than $2 million, this Finnish export certainly puts a new spin on Santa with dark humor, horror and the type of suspense that one would expect in a vintage John Carpenter film.

A team of British and American workers are digging something out of a mountain in Finland--it seems that the Santa of legend does exist. He's not exactly a nice guy with kids who are naughty--he's more like his brother Krampus. He's not very jolly, either.

My only complaint is that I would have loved to see Santa released for a brief period. The director does a good job with the child performers and creates a suspenseful film that has a better ending than ""Krampus"" the horror comedy also focusing on Christmas and the fall out from being a bad kid.

I haven't seen the Blu-ray (I watched it on demand from the Comic-Con Channel) but, based on reports I've heard, it evidently has a nice, solid transfer and audio sounds quite nice. The on demand version looked pretty good as well.

The ending rather cleverly plays on the title. I do wish there had been a full on confrontation at the conclusion that was a bit better thought out but it doesn't detract from the fun of the movie.

The blu-ray for those who are interested features a making of featurette, production art, stills and the two shorts that played on the internet and inspired the feature. For those that might enjoy it, the horrible feature film ""Santa Claus vs. The Martians"" is also included. The film, which fell into the public domain, is available here in a less than attractive old print that hasn't been cleaned up all that much (it looks pretty beat up, too).",1481500800,3,1720,4.607843137254902

I just didn't feel the filmmakers got the balance right at all. I felt like 10-15 minutes of character moments had been chopped out. Suddenly, the boy becomes this determined, brave character... huh? Maybe it's a cultural difference. (and, I should point out, I say that as a fan of films from other countries. Half the movies i watch are non-English-speaking) I mean, I can enjoy an absurd movie, and/or satire, and/or farce. But after about a 1/4 into the running time, this seemed to lurch awkwardly from extreme to extreme. And then there's, well, the, for me, incredibly poor choice of having the thing we're led to believe is ""the big bad"" turn out not to be. Once that was revealed, the whole thing fell apart for me. I felt like I'd invested time in this story only to be misled for no good reason. After all, when multiple antagonists need to be realized by slightly dodgy cgi... the wonderful, visceral quality is lost. For me, at least. I was left wondering what the big deal was behind all the reviews and praise listed on the dvd box.

4532122,3,B0052WKZY2,"If you're expecting a Finnish version of Krampus, you'll likely be disappointed as this is a low budget film with not a lot of action. It's more of a character coming of age film revolving around a young boy who doesn't like to wear pants, and his father who believes a good dinner consists of gingerbread biscuits and is somewhat uncomfortable in the father raising a child role. Their mother/wife passed away some time ago and the two are living in a remote isolated part of Finland on the (Russian I assume but could be Sweden as it isn't stated) border. One day the boy and a kid who lives nearby sneak across the border up to the top of a mountain to eavesdrop on some survey mining being done by Americans. They learn something they shouldn't and worry they will be in trouble. Their fathers and other neighbours have a plan to capture migrating reindeer which they will slaughter in the homemade abattoir on the boy's property. Problem is the wolves (they assume) have slaughtered them all and they blame the Americans doing the surveying across the border for the wolves' behaviour. They decide to confront the Americans and make them compensate them financially. But the Americans aren't there and seem to have left in a hurry. The boy of course knows what is happening but the adults don't believe him. When an old man turns up in an illegal wolf pit impaled on the wooden spikes the father put there, they are about to learn what the legend of Santa was all about!

This is a film where other than American miners, everyone else of course speaks Finnish, but there's English subtitles.

The movie screams low budget/indie, but is done so well you won't notice when your in the thick of it, that is If you can get past the subtitles (no English release that I know of). This movie had the same budget as sharknado, and does everything so convincingly, and we have three Sharknado's... I blame you for that By the Way. This movie is played as if everything in its setting is real and there are no forced jokes, dialogue or film-wise. This movie is a little Darker than gremlins, but no were near Silent Night Deadly Night.

If you want to broaden your collection of Christmas Horror movies this one will fit the bill, and be something to talk about during eggnog, and cookies.

I was a tad concerned it might be a horror movie a la Silent Night, Deadly Night, but it isn't. It's got some tense elements, but that takes a backdoor to what really is an original and great story.

You should definitely check this out. To a person, everyone to whom I've recommended this as a holiday film has made it a tradition. We watch it each year; this year I purchased it because it is no longer offered for streaming.",1457568000,,625,4.482456140350878

One of my favorites is when the hero, who is about 10, walks up to his father with a big stick. Father is upset because he thinks he accidentally killed someone and he is talking about that to a couple friends. The kid gives the stick to his father and says that he needs fifteen good whack with the stick. He turns around and begins to lower his pants and bend over. Needless to say, his father is disconcerted by this strange behavior, as if he did not have enough on his mind already.

4532158,4,B0052WKZY2,"I'm very glad that I decided to check out Rare Exports. The great thing about this film--which other reviews mention--is that it is tense and a bit scary without resorting to actual horror or gratuitous means, as well as charming and Christmasy without succumbing the the tepid cliches that most holiday films do. This one is well-paced, with a great sense of atmosphere and an excellent balance, if at times the mood is hard to read (scary? oddly humorous? both?). The setting, cast and especially the riveting premise itself, all superb. I think that 4.5 stars is about right. The ending may not work for everyone, but all in all, this is such a breath of fresh air that it merits checking out for anyone looking to splash some cold water on the face of Christmas movie-time.

(And I have to say--the cover art here does not do the film justice. The story, both in its content and visual approach, is much more pristine, rustic, occasionally mystical than what this image suggests.)",1449792000,,984,4.72093023255814

It was well crafted and genuinely creepy, not quite scary, but creepy. It has likeable characters that develop in believable ways. It is subtitled, but it's so engaging you won't even care. Ultimately, it's a suspense thriller (you might call it horror, but I don't) and a Christmas movie, but it doesn't flop in either regard. It really achieves both very well and is now my favorite holiday movie. I've watched it once a year for the last 4 years, and I'm about to watch it again.",1449273600,2,613,4.531531531531532

The only reason that the men can come up for this occurrence is some mysterious happenings going on at a local mountain.  While Pietri's father and friends think that the goings on at the mountain are responsible, Pietri has his own idea.  After he reads some books about Santa Claus (Sinta Klaus), and discovers he is not as benevolent as he has always been portrayed.  Santa's elf helpers are also not portrayed as we normally think of them.  The only portraits that we see of Santa are the illustrations in the books that Pietri looks through.  The ending I found to be very funny and clever.  Parents should be on hand if young children watch this movie, because they may have a lot of explaining to do. A hot cup of cocoa should be handy if they become too scared, but, at least, they will know the origin of who Santa really is.",1444953600,8,1030,4.417989417989418

The 1964 Martian Christmas bonus gave me a headache.  It has not been restored, so the print is worse than terrible.  I swear it was an Ed Wood movie.

If you're looking for anything in the US's typical main tradition of Christmas, this is not going to be your thing. There are hints of 'scary' or 'horror' and 'gore' - but not gross or dwelling on any of that. This comes from some of the myths involving local traditions of the yule season before the western 'santa claus' was introduced. These traditions, in their day, focused on the bad things that would become of young children that were 'bad.' Imagine a touch of Hieronymous Bosch & his depictions of Hell. Beyond that - the movie is a delightful touching story of this young kid who did something 'wrong' ... but then tries to do the right thing. And then - without being a plot spoiler - the stage is set for a most imaginative twist on Christmas & the merging of the old local & the new western traditions.

On to the review...

Great flick, totally out of the ordinary.

For the people with the bad reviews because Santa is a monster and the elves put the kinds in sacks, blah blah blah, read up about Krampus and you'll understand the entire thing with the evil Santa (Satan) thing :)

Being that Europeans are not hung up on nudity are Americans are, there is a little bit of ""no big deal"" nudity in the movie.  Nothing your kids haven't seen if they've been to a museum.

Also, the entire story is about the kid, not Santa or the adults in the movie.

It's definitely not a movie for anyone, but if you enjoy a bit of darker (not dark) humor mixed up with a fairy tale, then this is going to be a good watch.

I just found the whole move to appeal to my sense of humor with a slightly twisted point of view.  Although, they are not really all that much alike, the sense of humor is very similar in ""Naked Lunch"" I'd say if you like one you'll like the other.

4532256,5,B0052WKZY2,"I watched this streaming on Netflix before they removed it from the catalogue. What a film. I'm not a horror fan, except maybe Le Fanu stories, but this film didn't strike me as horror. Set in the far north, with a very engaging protagonist, the story gradually became odder and odder. Stranger, and then outright creepy.
Yet the whole time I was rooting for the boy, his dad, and their neighbors. There were clearly good guys and bad guys (some of whom are developers bent on raping their land...).
This is a wild and dark modern fairy tale:a look into the interface between modern Laplander life, and the darkest twists of old legends of the north.
This is a BRILLIANT film. I'm ordering the Blu-Ray now. It's a keeper. A seasonal ritual of It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas, and Rare Exports? Just might happen!!

N.B. I don't care how advanced your children are, DO NOT let anyone under 12 (maybe 15?) watch this until you have thoroughly explored it.",1411171200,,960,4.647058823529412

4532258,3,B0052WKZY2,"If you are looking for something different this holiday season, well you can't get much more different than ""Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale""?!!?! I'm not quite sure what I expected with this movie, maybe something similar to ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" or ""Santa's Slay""...one of those cheezy maniacs dressed as Santa slasher films which pop up now and again, but I sure didn't expect this story.

I will do my best to keep this review spoiler free, but with that said I recommend you quit reading reviews of this film if you have any interest in seeing it, and simply watch the movie. I think you'll enjoy the viewing experience much more going into the story blind. As the film opens we see a construction crew excavating the top of a mountain, one of their drill bits has brought up a bunch of sawdust. Apparently this isn't a mountain at all, but a burial mound, and the man who hired the excavation crew is hoping to unearth what is buried in the giant tomb. Living at the base of the mountain are a group of farmers getting ready to capture and hunt down this year's reindeer herd.

Two young boys who have been trespassing near the excavation learn that the mountain is actually a burial mound, and the younger begins to speculate that Santa is buried there. But it's not the friendly Santa seen in films. This Santa brutally punishes naughty children, and when the reindeer herd is slaughtered, and children go missing, the young boy's fear seem to be coming true.

This is an imaginative film, with some pretty great visuals and an odd sense of humor. I like the suspense that is built as we get to the climax and the true Santa's threat looms over the naughty children. Where this movie loses me though is the ending, I'm not quite sure what the ""solution"" is? I'm not quite sure how or why the ""Rare Exports"" is exporting.....the ""product"" they are exporting? Who are they sending these ""items"" too, who ordered them...and what is their intention of sending these ""goods"" around the world? Perhaps it was something I missed in translation, but to me it was never made clear why they were sending these exports around the world, and how this was going to save them financially.

With that said, this was a quick and fun movie, with some great visuals. Not sure if it's something I would buy, but definitely worth a rental.",1410825600,,2333,4.600961538461538

4532272,5,B0052WKZY2,"Rare Exports is not a Holiday horror film in the vein of a number of Santa/Slasher films that have popped up over the years, but rather is a suspense film whose mood of eeriness and tension builds until you are completely enveloped in it. Everything in the film from the minimal but effective music by Juri and Miska Seppa to the vast mountainous and snowy landscape of Finnish Lapland add to the feeling of solitude amid a growing sense of alarm.

The story is based on the old Finnish Santa Claus of legend, who was no giver of gifts, but rather a terrifying punisher of children who had been bad whose punishments are shown to have included boiling them in cauldrons. No jolly old elf here. It seems a local archaeological dig plans to unearth this monster after he had been frozen in ice and buried in Korvatunturi mountain - the actual filming site, right on the Russian-Finnish border, southeast of Lake Inari, the big lake in Northern Finland.

The truth about the dig is discovered by a young boy who prepares for the worst while realizing that no one will believe him. The boy, Pietari, is wonderfully played by Onni Tommila who appears so small and vulnerable yet proves himself incredibly courageous and heroic in the end. Despite his youth, Onni is fully able to carry the film as its very primary characer, assisted only occasionally by his friend Aimo and his rather stern father (played by the boy's actual father).

Overall the film is skillfully made, by a director who is tops at building suspense. Yet the film has some issues which need to be touched upon. Although it borders on horror, horror fans will be disappointed as there is no real gore or any scene of the truly horrific. Despite being suspenseful the film is also a black comedy, so you should not go into it with absolute seriousness and must be forgiving of a number of plot holes. Most of all, there is a certain amount of disappointment even among many fans of the film (including myself) that the end does not quite live up to the buildup. We've all become accustomed to massively overblown CGI endings to films like this from Hollywood movies and the budget of an independent film from Finland simply didn't allow this. Still, a little more would have helped simply because one is expecting more. I can't say more without giving too much away, but I will note that it all works better on a second viewing once you know that the ending isn't gigantic.

Then there is the R-rating. There is one scene of brief violence and blood. And then there's the nudity. It wasn't really necessary, but people in Northern Europe are very casual about such things unlike people in the U.S. I will give a bit away here (SPOILER) and note that these are old men playing Santa's Elves, seen from a dark and blurred distance. But it's there, frontal nudity, and people who are sensitive to such things need to know this.

Finally, there is a bit of a joke-like postscript tacked on at the end. Many people don't like it because of its wild improbability. But this ending existed in an earlier form before the film was made - a humorous short subject - and it inspired the making of the film and so it had to be included. I'm one of those who see the film actually ending earlier, and this a little extra humor.

This film is totally unique and worth checking out for a little Holiday eeriness.",1393632000,2,3361,4.556291390728477

4532275,5,B0052WKZY2,"You'll see a lot of reviews about this film that talk about how wildly innovative it all is -- and ""Rare Exports"" is certainly that.  But what's missing is that ""Rare Exports"" is actually about Krampus.

Krampus hasn't really received the appropriate treatment up to this point in films, although he keeps getting a little more exposure each year (American Dad even had a Krampus episode). Thing is, we don't need a definitive Krampus film because ""Rare Exports"" is it.

Reindeer herder Rauno (Jorma Tommila) is a lonely man who raises his precocious son Pietari (Onni Tommila) alone in Finland.  On the night before Christmas, what starts out as a slaughter of an entire reindeer herd (and the financial ruin of the herders who rely on them), turns into an escalating series of increasingly disturbing encounters with Santa's helpers.

To say more than that is too give away too much, but suffice it to say that naked old men have never been so disturbing.  Indeed, ""Rare Exports"" takes great glee in juxtaposing naked old men menacing young boys, and it really does put the legend of Santa in stark relief for the absurdity that it is.

The title only makes sense at the end. Fans of Krampus will not be disappointed.",1390780800,,1219,4.748815165876778
4532276,3,B0052WKZY2,"Ready for a complete change of pace? Have I got one for you!

The full name of this Finnish tale (English captions) is ""Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale,"" and it's about Pietari, a little Lapp boy living with his widowed father in an isolated settlement up near the Russian border. His father depends on reindeer for their livelihood but their way of life is disrupted when, just across the border, a construction company sets up and begins dismantling a nearby mountain. This activity disrupts the local balance and their entire reindeer herd is soon found dead. This is a crucial event and spells disaster for father and son.

We watch as our little guy gossips with a chum about ""the REAL Santa Claus, not the Coca Cola one we believe in. Our parents have lied to us!"" He launches a major investigation about this mythical Santa and discovers that, according to Lapland lore, naughty children are stolen on Christmas Eve and never come back!

Now he's really concerned, particularly on Christmas Eve when his school chums start disappearing.... and he discovers that the construction across the border is really an architectural dig... and his father doesn't believe any of his theories... and he's supposed to go to bed early...

Archaeologists open the world's largest burial mound. Santa Claus escapes... but's he's evil, only punishing the naughty children... and then what?

It seemed to be a script written by The Brothers Grimm if they were imagining Gremlins... but there is an awful lot of time spend with nothing happening.

4532288,5,B0052WKZY2,"Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (Jalmari Helander, 2010)

I am not a fan of the Christmas season, in general. Carols make me want to tear my ears off, blue LED lights do more to contribute to auto accidents than celebrate anything, etc. So it's rare that I find a Christmas-related movie that really works for me (and, let's face it, It's a Wonderful Life is a Christmas movie by convention and set decoration more than subject matter). But man, you throw a little Krampus into the mix and I'm there with brass knobs on. I'd heard wonderful things about Rare Exports for years before I actually sat down and watched the blessed thing, and now I have no idea why I resisted. It lives up to everything I'd heard and then some.

Plot: towards the beginning of December, a mining corporation unearths an ice-bound Santa Claus while drilling for something entirely unrelated. An amazing discovery! Well, not if you happen to live in the surrounding area; in the days leading up to Christmas, local children start to disappear. Of course, this being a fairy tale, the first people to understand what's really going onthat Santa's elves are taking the children and preparing them for some sort of ritual to free their leaderare two teenagers, Pietari (Last Cowboy Standing's Onni Tommila) and his best friend Juuso (Ilmari J:arvenp:a:a, who appeared with Tommila in LCS as well). Pietari puts it all together, and while Juuso is initially skeptical, he eventually starts coming around...and then disappears. With no one left to turn to, Pietari tries the adults around him, starting with his father, Rauno (Tommila's real-life father Jorma, recently of The Visitor). Lather, rinse, repeat.

There is something, seemingly, inherently magical about fairy tales told from the perspective of a child. (Contrast this, for example, with 2012's Black Forest, in which all of the protagonists are adults; while this isn't the only flaw in Black Forest, it's a big one.) Is it the ability of movies like this to tap into the atavisms we have left in our heads from our own childhoods, no matter how far we might have repressed them? I think that's a big part of it, along with a return to a simpler mindset, where we allow ourselves to believe things we normally wouldn't. It's a way of hooking into the audience immediately, and giving us a kit like Pietari, smart, something of an introvert, strained relationship with his father, and as long as you make the kid at least marginally likable and three-dimensional enough, you've automatically connected with your audience. And Helander, who also wrote the script, did shortcut us a little; Pietari is interchangeable with the teen protagonists of any number of recent movies with teen protagonists. I was okay with that, though, because Helander treats him like an archetype, not a stereotype. Pietari is a three-dimensional character who gives us realistic reactions to very unrealistic situations, and that's good enough for me. Helander also understand how to balance the realism of his setting, which is rural (with all that that entailsyes, it's elves vs. rednecks), with the ridiculousness of his plotline, and at no time does he ever stray too far into one realm or the other; this is huge for suspension of disbelief. And I have to admit, as someone who has his problems with Christmas, I was chortling with sadistic glee throughout most of the final third of the film (about which, obviously, I can't say much without major spoilers, so you'll just have to trust me here). Oh, that reminds me. Helander tried, and succeeded, at something that I have come to understand is very difficultthe false ending. You know the one, where the director give you a resolution, then yells, PSYCH! You've got fifteen more minutes of movie! Usually it's just annoying, but some directors do it so well you just can't help but be wowed. (B&eacute;la Tarr does it three times in The Turin Horse. It's ridiculous.) Helander falls into the latter category with this one. Obviously I can't tell you how or why. It's just another reason you have got to watch this movie, and the sooner the better. If it isn't the best Christmas movie ever made, it's somewhere in the top three. **** ",1387843200,,4205,4.876923076923077

4532290,5,B0052WKZY2,"I first watched this film on Netflicks after searching through the foreign film section for a good holiday film.  What a pleasant surprise - a combination of my three favorite film genres; Holiday, Foreign, and Horror.  I give it two thumbs up!!  I'm not a fan of dubbed films so I'm very happy that this is a non-dubbed version. I haven't come across a dubbed-version but have read many reviews that have cited a dubbed-version available in the US.  It's not too scary, not too Christmas-y, definitely NOT a kids film.  I especially like the ""rules""; no smoking, no drinking, no cussing...the results of doing those things around one of these ""Santas"" could prove fatal to your health.
I don't order products online from places like Walmart, Kmart, and Target when I can just hop in my car and drive to one of their local stores.  I do order from Amazon when I can't find what I'm looking for in any of those local stores.  THANK YOU Amazon for having this film available through your website.

Wonderfully acted and fun, just not for the whole family. There really isn't too much in the way of graphic violence, but suspense ... and Santa as the bad guy ... should keep the younger children away.

When a mining company starts blasting on that mountain, bad things ensue.  Young Pietari has to convince the adults about what's really happening.

The scenery is awesome.  The special effects are ok.  The acting is pretty good.  This is something that no american company would do.

There is some nudity - however, it fits in with the story and the only nude people are old guys.  That being said, it is not something that is focused on - so don't be alarmed.

4532305,5,B0052WKZY2,"This is not a Christmas film, but rather a darkly comic fairytale drawn from the Sami (Lapp) people's version of the much earlier Yule legend. I think that the confusion here arises from difficulty in translating this into English, as there is no name for the spirit of Yule that is in common usage in English. The nearest we have is Santa Claus, who is a christian figure, originating in Anatolia, in Turkey. That established, this is actually a wonderful modern approach to the fairytale, and how a small community deals with it's coming to life. Particular mention must go to the harsh but stunning scenery of the Finnish/Russian border region of Karelia, as well as to the performances of the two lead actors, Onni Tommila and Jorma Tommila as the Pietaari and his father Rauno. I suspect they are genuine father and son, as the ease with which they interact is born of long association, and of course the actors have the same last name. The pair are outstanding as grow closer as a result of their adventures.

Would have liked to see more development of the ""elves"", some of those long paused moments that would exchange a few more seconds of glances with the other characters that he came across.

But now, Santa has been released, and it is up three of the town's trappers and their brave young boy to stop the creature before it can wreak its bloody vengeance on all of the Earth's children! RARE EXPORTS met with immediate success upon its initial release in 2010, gathering the support of cineasts world-wide as ""an instant Christmas classic."" Ancient lore mixes with modern humor as director Jalmari Helander explores the darker side of the Christmas tradition. Helander tells this whimsical fairytale with a wink, allowing the twisted humor to flow naturally from his characters as they approach the feral Santa Claus with utter apprehension. Onni Tommila gives a heartfelt and endearing performance as Pietari, who passes easily through the rites of manhood as he conquers his childhood fears in order to save his friends. The only misstep falls on the rushed and gimmicky finale, which breaks away from the slow and deliberate pacing while dispelling much of the film's magic for a few cheap laughs. RARE EXPORTS is a complete departure from any other holiday-themed horror film that will surely be revisited for many years to come.

May not be for everyone. Although suspenseful, good tension and a bit of scariness, it still has a nice family theme with the main character and hero as a young boy in a whacked out situation.

4532318,4,B0052WKZY2,"This is one of those rare foreign films in which you read the subtitles even if you aren't the type to like such films. While it isn't perfect I could almost label it a flawed masterpiece for its tantalizing concept.

What if Santa was real but rather than rewarding good kids he punished bad children? And what if he had been entombed in ice for a long time and his ""elves"" were in the process of helping him get out so he could bring terror back to the world. And what if the only good boy in the area knew about this legend and tried to stop it all but the adults ignore him?

Tension is eased up gradually not slammed in your face like clumsy American films I won't name. Things happen at a subtle level and that is one of the great strengths of this picture. Another strength is the setting and Finnish culture (people wearing their underwear out the snow, Santa Claus with horns per their legend of him, etc).

What are some of the weaknesses? The finale could have been better. It was somewhat good at best. Also, the flip flop between suspense style horror and dark comedy sometimes worked and other times fizzled or just didn't register. See spoilers below if you already watched this picture.

There's a fair amount of non sexual male nudity in this one so American prudes should steer clear.

This movie was on a limited budget (and is therefore graded on such a curve) and was based on two movie shorts by a Finnish company.

However, this isn't a regular excavation; the burial site is home to the original Santa Clause that punishes naughty children- and it still has a pulse. Rare Exports is a wonderful twist on Santa Clause, and my holiday movie tradition.

Rare Exports is a captivating fantasy film. The entire concept is enchanting yet frightening; a creepy Santa Clause that punishes naughty children after watching/stalking them for days, and the twist at the end was great as well. The film has a very fast pace, and is over before you know it- likely because of the 1hr 15 min runtime (without credits). The film uses this time wisely, though, without a single dull moment. Rare Exports is absolutely beautiful visually, amazing cinematography- definitely a movie worth owning on Blu-ray. The music is also amazing and matches the tone/atmosphere of the film. The acting was also great from the entire cast.

Overall, I loved Rare Exports and will continue to watch this film particularly during the holiday season. It's a beautiful and magical film, with a creepy yet fascinating concept; a story that is not done often, or at least not done as well as this, in my opinion. A purchase is highly recommended.

The scene with Pietri and his dad on Christmas Eve will make you tear up. I just love the closeness of their relationship. The more you watch it the more you pick up and appreciate. It's a very clever and dark spin on the classic Christmas story we all know. A warning to parents with young kids, this is not a young kids movie (when you see the scene with Pietri herding nearly 200 naked elves you'll understand why).

Rare exports is never truly scary, but there are plenty of creepy chills to satisfy horror fans, as well as some genuine laughs.  This movie has joined the annual holiday viewing lineup at our house alongside classics like A Christmas Story and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

4532329,4,B0052WKZY2,"I don't understand at all why the movie is being advertised as a ""dark comedy"", because the first hour I viewed was in every way a horror movie! It had me on the edge of my seat and there was nothing funny about it! It was an excellent set up for a movie in which we learn that someone we thought was good, is actually nightmarishly evil--and that someone is Santa! In fact, he's not even human! I was thinking, ""This is not a Christmas movie! In fact, I think its about to become one of the best horror films I've seen!""

But then in the last 30 minutes the movie falls completly apart! The kid in the film comes to the rescue of everyone, like something from the movie ""E.T."", and theres apparently a giant Santa that we never really see (who has horns, for some reason!) and the ending is totally ridiculous! In other words, the first hour is a serious horror film, the last 30 minutes is a strange dark comedy. I hate it when movies ""change gears"" like that! Those who made the film were confused about what kind of movie they were making!

This could have been a great horror film, in which we learn that the myth from a childrens fairy tale is in fact a horrible creature who has been sealed away for centuries to protect children (and not to bring them gifts!) Such a missed opportunity! This could have been the horror film of the decade! My hope is that an American film maker will latch on to this and turn it into the film it should have been.",1355616000,,1454,4.245487364620939
4532330,1,B0052WKZY2,"How can anyone call this a classic holiday film??? If I could give it negative stars I would. There is no humor in it, dark or otherwise. It's a pedophile's dream. I'm a horror fan who received it as a gift after reading the 5 star reviews. The reviews here caused me to waste an evening waiting for this digusting tripe to become a campy horror movie. It has an all male cast, with a storyline about a demon buried because he beat disobedient, naked naughty boys with sticks. The rifle toting boy who stars in this figures out only a boy child will attract this demon who is played throughout naked. A corporation digs up the main demon as part of a dark secret project.
  All the little boys in town are kidnapped by the demons, bagged, then stolen back by the boy's uncles and airlifted to the demon site. There they are held in the bag hanging from a helicopter as bait to round up hundreds of male naked elf demons while the boy's father blows up the main demon. At the end of the movie, in the final scenes, the elf demon problem spreads and the little boy uses himself as bait to attract hundreds of the naked boy beating elf/clause/demons to a corral where only he can open the gate. In the corral they are exorcised by the death of the main demon.
  In the last section, the little boy, his dad and friends bathe the naked men in a big open all male shower, with frontal nudity and a flash of a partial erection included, as they do a wash down of the naked old men with mops. Finally, in the last two scenes of the film the naked men are dressed, given little child dolls, which they are taught to pet and cuddle kindly on their laps, and are dressed in red suits. Once dressed in Clause clothes all trained to pet little children, they are sold, packed in crates stamped ""rare exports"", and shipped all over the world. It scares me that so many reviewers recommended this film become a ""holiday classic"" in anyone's home. If this a classic, the world we live in is deep trouble. *Reviewers note: when this was first marketed it was sold uncut and unrated. Since my viewing of it was rated. It now carries an ""R"" rating.

4532333,4,B0052WKZY2,"If you're looking for something a bit unusual for your Christmas film fare, this may be your ticket.  Coming from our friends in Finland, director Jalmari Helander takes a little bit of Bob Clark's 1983 classic ""A Christmas Story,"" and mixes in a good part of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and adds a little of ""Bad Santa"" for good measure.

Pietari (Onni Tommita) is a lad of about 11 and a reminder of Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story"" although he looks more like his younger brother Randy.  He lives with his father in the northern reaches of Finland.  The mother is unaccounted for but presumed to have died.  Rauno (Jorma Tommila) along with a handful of friends make a living butchering reindeer, which are usually in plentiful supply.

An American crew of ""scientists"" has set up shop at a nearby mountain top and has excavated and uncovered a huge block of ice with an unusual item encased.  While this is going on, the townsmen are trying to protect the reindeer from wolves which appear to be unusually voracious this year.  Rauno digs a large pit, hoping the wolves will fall to their death.  Believing he has coaxed a wolf to his death, Rauno finds instead it is an old naked man who is still alive.

One of the fables of this area is that Santa Claus isn't the nicest guy around as portrayed in most countries.  Books abound suggesting he is evil and turns children who are not good into burlap mannequins.  This story progresses with the characters trying to figure out what Pietari already knows.

While the film isn't terribly graphic (OK, butchered animals and naked old men excepted) it does have a dark undertone.  At the same time there is plenty of craziness and dry humor.  I was pretty caught up in what must be described as a darkly wicked fairy tale. But the film starts to go a bit overboard in the final act.  Still if you're looking for something different, oddly entertaining and a bit grotesque, take a look.",1353196800,2,1936,4.600583090379009

4532335,5,B0052WKZY2,"In the Korvatunturi fell, American workers are unearthing some great treasure in what the investor of this project calls a giant burial ground. This investor seems very nervous about dangers from what lies beneath the rubble of this landscape. He also has a list of new rules for the workers including not swearing and being nice. Meanwhile, local reindeer herders are devastated when they find their live stock slaughtered. Two boys feel guilty as they suspect predators used the hole they cut into a fence to attack the reindeer, but perhaps more dangerous creatures are the culprits. When the foreign workers and local children start disappearing and a bearded old man with special powers is found in a wolf trap, the locals of this Finnish town must find out what ominous, not-so-jolly force has encroached into their lives.

This is a very clever and creative take on the Father Christmas or Santa Claus legends, and it ends up doing ""Gremlins"" better than ""Gremlins"" in an instant classic holiday movie. This isn't a very graphic or scary film but it is narrated and told in similar fashion to thrillers or horror movies and there are some creepy moments. In fact, there is something inherently creepy about even a benevolent magical man seeing you as you sleep and knowing if you have been good or not. ""Rare Exports"" adds a new twist to this angle with Santa Claus being keen on punishing, rather than rewarding, children. The film is beautifully shot in an area of the world not often shown in film.

There is a good dose of humor, especially as one particular local worker, who knows a bit of English, tries to communicate with the American financier of the archaeological dig. His reply to ""Where are my men?"" is quite funny. This film is well patched with dark humor, mythology and even Christmas wonder, particularly from the naive young boy, Pietari, who is fascinated by the legends and old tales of Christmastime. My one complaint of the film is that it is a bit on the short side, and it feels even shorter because it is an entertaining story I wish did not end so soon.

The DVD of this film offers a subtitled making of documentary, the original trailer, press photos, ""Blood in the Snow"" (concept art of the film) and two short films. These short films are mock documentaries released several years before this film was made and they are very humorous satire, but best to watch after seeing the feature film.",1345593600,,2428,4.735224586288416

4532338,4,B0052WKZY2,"FRIGHTFUL PLOT SUMMARY: Looking for something a little different this Halloween? This Finnish import - a feature expansion of a pair of short movies by writer-director Jalmari Helander that generated internet buzz several years ago - finds a young boy named Pietari wondering what's going on in an excavation on the top of a neighboring mountain. It turns out that none other than the original Santa Claus and his elves are buried deep in the ice, but this assortment of would-be jolly holiday characters is anything but - after thawing out, the group abduct the local children and generally exhibit abhorrent behavior! At only 83 minutes, ""Rare Exports"" comes across as a group of interesting ideas that don't entirely live up to their potential. The film slowly builds up to its ultimate revelations about ""Claus"" and more than half of the running time is gone by the point in which Helander kicks the film into gear. From that point, ""Rare Exports"" offers some amusing moments and set-pieces even though most of the special effects are minor and Helander uses the power of suggestion in depicting the true, real Santa Claus, who we (alas) never see thaw out from the big block of ice he's imprisoned in. Individual moments, however, do shine through, and the picture is well-made and surprisingly sincere - it's just a bit of a disappointment that ""Rare Exports"" isn't nearly as mischievous and developed as it could have been. Perhaps an Americanized remake might follow through on that end of things (of course it could also be worse!).

CHILLING BLU-RAY SPECS: Oscilloscope's Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack offers a strong, well detailed AVC encoded 1080p transfer with DTS MA audio. The music score is atmospheric though the total lack of any holiday tunes is a bit of a surprise. For extras, the original two, 10-minute shorts are included plus a 30-minute subtitled Making Of, concept art, a stills gallery, effects animation/animatic reels, and as a bonus, a poor-looking standard-def transfer of the infamous bomb ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.""

SCARE-TASTIC BOTTOM LINE: Although some critics drew comparisons between ""Rare Exports"" and ""Gremlins,"" as well as the early films of Spielberg, Joe Dante and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the movie isn't really as whimsical or funny as its premise suggests. It is, however, an intriguing and memorable film that, while it doesn't entirely come together, ought to enchant horror - and even holiday movie - fans with its offbeat sensibilities.",1336953600,7,2487,5.0931372549019605

I've read some pretty good things about this film, so I thought it was time to see what all the hubbub was about for myself! I mean, a film about the true Santa Claus, who is not jolly in the least bit, & serves as an age old European boogeyman! Now thats got my curiosity sky high, & had my expectations red lining for a merry bloody Christmas!

Though not quite the film I had envisioned in my mind's eye, ""Rare Exports"" was indeed worth the watch. Here we have a film that is truly original, if nothing else, but that ""nothing else,"" does not apply here. We also get a goodly amount of atmospheric dread as this movie builds up to it's conclusion. We get a few good red herrings along the way. The movie is handsomely filmed, directed, scripted, acted, & the plot is, to say the least, original. We also get to see the baser side of the human condition, when large sums of money are at stake. A true metaphor to ""naughty or nice.""

My biggest problem is the climax is somewhat anti-climatic, at least for me, but maybe not for you? I won't give it away. The epilogue is very clever though, & again, I won't give it away.

All & all, ""Rare Exports"" is a film that will repay the viewer well with repeated viewings, especially in the ""Yuletide"" season!",1336608000,3,1272,4.2875

Taking place in Finland, with dialogue in both English and Finnish, this wonderful movie takes the entire Santa Claus idea and flips it on its head.  So instead of a feel-good family comedy, we have a action-adventure with some comedy and some gore.  Even though it features kids, I would not suggest any child to watch this as the movie can be quite scary in parts.  The pacing is great, and the dialogue comes through fine as subtitles.  The cinematography is beautiful, and the acting is realistic.  My only critic of the movie is the lack of a great soundtrack.

4532341,4,B0052WKZY2,"If you try to tell someone this is a Christmas horror movie it sounds silly and bizarre. But once you get into it you realize the amount of sense it makes.

Here's the scoop. Some rich guy has discovered that Santa has been buried in a man made mountain in Finland and wants to free him. He doesn't know the kind of trouble he is causing. Kids start to disappear and it's up to the last remaining boy in the area to save the day.

First off, the viewer needs to realize that we aren't dealing with the newer, Coca Cola style Santa with the chubby belly and rosy cheeks. This is the old school Santa which was more like a pagan style creature that looked like a demon. And back then, kids on the 'bad' list didn't just get coal in their stocking, they got tortured and even killed. So, once that's on the table, the story makes greater sense.

This is a very well written flick. Yes, it has horror at its core, but there is an element of mystery to boot and a very human element as well. These Laplanders are having tough times. The deer they usually capture and sell this time of year have been slaughtered by, they think, the Russians and then odd things go missing. The one boy left figures it out and works to make things well again.

I have some doubts about the climax but this is a heck of a flick overall. It's worth seeing if for no other reason than its new view on an old subject. If you like your horror left of center, this will spin your head around.",1336003200,2,1463,4.177304964539007

This was a very interesting take on a Christmas tale. The ending however was totally brilliant and I practically fell off my chair. I LOVED IT. Very cheeky!! American movies never have anything this original happening at the end, they would ruin it by rehashing the same old schlocky crap as always. This was the best ending to a horror film I have seen in ages.

This is not the type of horror film that has monsters with fangs constantly jumping out at everyone and constant blood baths. This has a lot of suspense and drama slowly building up and it is very well done. When the monsters in the film do come out, it is worth the wait.

And now some stupid Americans and Russians want to dig him up!  In doing so, they inadvertently destroy the reindeer harvest of some Finnish men across the border.  The men decide to go put in their two cents...but things are much, much bloodier than they anticipated.

RARE EXPORTS: A CHRISTMAS TALE has two main flaws.  The first is that, like so many horror movies before it, it focuses on a kid: in this case, Pietari, played by Onni Tommila.  And like so many other horror movie children, Pietari is annoying and useless.  He has a heroic scene near the end, but the cunning he expresses isn't shown anywhere else in the movie (in fact, he comes off as something of a dunce).  Kudos to Jorma Tommila as Pietari's father; he gives a solid, captivating performance.

The second flaw is that the film doesn't explore its full potential.  What's here is good (note the four stars), but it could have gone so much farther.  Peeter Jakobi, as the main antagonist, is fantastic, but he's not in the film much, and when the plot progresses (no spoilers), things get MUCH more interesting...and then fizz away, leading to a lackluster ending that just doesn't fit with the rest of the film.  It's far too comedic.  (Though it fits with the two short films included on the disc, which you should DEFINITELY watch--they're hilarious--but only after seeing the main film.)  Jalmari Helander's script and direction start out as one thing, then lead to another; both are great ideas, but not combined.  This could have been a fantastic horror film, but instead is merely an okay horror film with an incredible premise.  RARE EXPORTS is for fans of the genre, who love an original idea, but it's not either of the things it could have been, and that's a shame.",1326240000,3,1870,4.6871165644171775

Rare Exports is a rather tense thriller/black comedy. I wouldn't recommend for children even though the movie has brilliant child actors in it.

4532356,5,B0052WKZY2,"We loved Rare Exports and we will definitely be watching this movie every Christmas.

We are addicted to Scandinavian movies and books. Our family loved the original ""Let the Right One In"", ""Dead Snow"", ""Cold Prey"", ""Troll Hunter"". I'm sure there are others. But also non-horror Scandinavian movies like ""Kitchen Stories"" and ""Everlasting Moments"". We just ordered ""101 Reykjavik"".

So we were surprised to learn about Rare Exports. We had never heard of it and NPR movie reviewer Bob Mondello was reviewing it one week or so before the holidays. I ordered the blu-ray right away and got it in time for Christmas Eve. What a perfect way to spend the night. Completely quirky and irreverent. An all out assault on Santa Claus. I'm PA Dutch and we have the Belsnickel and I don't want that guy sneaking in my chimney either.

If you read the other reviews you can see the particulars about the movie starting off as a short. The shorts are included on the blu-ray version.",1325548800,2,970,4.727810650887574
4532357,5,B0052WKZY2,"What an interesting and gripping concept.  The actors were wonderful and the little boy who played the hero was charming.  And, the ending a great surprise and so funny!  I highly recommend this as an antidote to the syrupy Christmas stories that everyone sees.",1324857600,3,261,4.886363636363637
4532358,4,B0052WKZY2,"Well, this movie was just awesome. If you are like me and are a little jaded from watching the same Christmas movie marathons every year(yeah, I'm talking to you), then I highly recommend you give this movie a shot. **MINOR SPOILERS** First of all, it has everything that traditional Christmas movies USUALLY(I use caps for those Negative Nancys who will inevitably read this) don't have: action, suspense, dark humor, and, oh yeah, a giant furry Santa Claus with horns! The creepy setting of this movie was also very refreshing for me. As an American, I feel like most of the suspense movies we see get their spook factor mostly from a dark figure jumping out of some dark corner. Not so with this film. The director manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time without popping off any garden variety scare tactics. Not to mention, I was still able to laugh at the dark comedy throughout the movie and not loose any of the suspenseful uneasiness. After watching, I feel that only two things could have made it better for me. One would be that I'm still confused about why the main kid(Pietari) in the story had a piece of cardboard duct taped over his bunghole. While hilarious, it left me wondering ""WTF?"" Admittedly, we were drinking eggnog(beer) while watching this. So, if I missed the section of dialogue where this is explained, then please feel free to correct me. Now, before I give my next suggestion, I would like to point out that I loved the end of the movie and in no way felt that not having this took away from the film(Negative Nancys). The second thing I would have liked to see would, of course, be a giant CGI Santa Claus monster in his unfrozen state and his buck naked elves wreaking havoc over the snowy country side near Korvatunturi(mountain Santa was buried in) before our heroes finally take them down. I mean, call me old fashioned, but I've always been a sucker for that sort of thing. **END SPOILERS** Now, for the Blu-Ray comments. Picture and sound quality were superb. If you don't watch this in 1080p, then you are missing out(again, I'm talking to you). I wish I could say more on this, but unfortunately I don't know the technical terms for such things, so I will leave it at that. Overall, I give the film a 4 out of 5 stars for awesomeness and creativeness. So, watch the movie and Happy Holidays everyone!",1324598400,2,2359,4.566037735849057
4532359,5,B0052WKZY2,"As someone has already mentioned, the critical raves printed on the DVD cover have little to no bearing on the movie inside.  This is not Gremlins or The Nightmare Before Christmas, and I saw no sign of Spielberg's style or content, this is a movie that is unique in its own way and not to be compared to anything else you might have seen.  I don't know what it is with people needing to reference something else in order to explain something.  This is what it is and I for one was quite taken with its nonchalant approach to an icon of Christmas.  Considering all the countries that have some type of Santa, it stands to reason one of them was bound to be naughty and not nice.  This is about an ancient Santa with high ideals and you had better watch out, or else, if you happen to break one of his many rules of conduct.
I thought the idea of an archeological dig to locate this formidable Santa was a novel idea.  I liked just about everything in this movie but would have loved to have seen the actual Santa and not just his many naked `helpers'.  The two short films done previously to this feature should be watched first (it helps because the filmmakers weren't keen on explaining much).
But I especially loved the little hero who had the right idea but couldn't get anyone to sit still long enough to listen.

Almost perfect, definitely a keeper, and something I plan on watching every Christmas from now on.  I'm glad I stumbled upon it and had the good sense to buy it.",1324512000,3,1480,4.352727272727273
4532360,5,B0052WKZY2,"I saw the trailer for this movie and was compelled to purchase this DVD.  I'm glad I did.  It was unexpected and suspenseful.  The extras in this package were hysterical.  The folks responsible for this movie are like the George Romeros of scary Christmases.  Wonderful, dark, fascinating and hysterical.",1324425600,2,304,5.122448979591836
4532361,5,B0052WKZY2,"This and Trollhunter have been my favorite movies all year. This one beats out Trollhunter by just a smidge, because the ending is better (great!) and the colors/camera work are awesome. Original story, with suspense, humor and characters you really adore. Great +",1323820800,,264,5.162790697674419
4532362,4,B0052WKZY2,"I strongly recommend not being one of those people that randomly buy movies hoping it will be good. You can't do that with this movie (in most cases). If you are thinking of purchasing this movie, there are a few things you really should know about before you buy it.

1) This Movie Was Based Off Of Short Films. The makers of this film, a few years back, made 2 mini shorts. They made the shorts as a parody of Christmas, with some dark humor to it. They played the shorts on TV around Christmas time for years. It did so well in Finland, that they decided to make a full length movie about it, which is this product. You can find the mini shorts on You Tube if you search ""Rare Exports"" (they have it on You Tube in both English & Finnish). If you have already purchased this or got it as a gift, WATCH THE SHORTS FIRST BEFORE YOU WATCH THE MOVIE (they are on the DVD as well). Also, don't confuse the trailer with the shorts since they're both up on You Tube & on the DVD. If you watch them before the move, you will better understand the movie, & know what kind of movie you're getting yourself into. If you like the shorts, you'll probably like the movie too.

2) It Helps If You Understand Finnish Culture. I really think that if you have some knowledge of the Finnish culture, it helps with appreciating this movie (though this isn't a must, like watching the shorts, for this movie). In Finland, they believe that Santa Clause (or Joulupukki in Finnish, which means ""Yule Goat"") is from Korvatunturi, Lapland (Northern Finland). He sends his elves (Tonttu/Tontut) to do the dirty work of spying on children to see if they are naughty of nice for him year round. In one persons review for this movie, they talked about ""randomly appearing calendar dates"", but they aren't random; they're actually part of the Finnish advent calendar system which counts the days until Christmas from the first of December. Just knowing little things like that help you better understand things like ""Why do most of the pictures of Santa in the movie have horns?"" (he is called the ""Yule Goat""). Also, knowing how the culture acts is kind of nice knowing as well when you watch this movie. My Husband pointed out ""See, Finnish kids really don't care about the cold"", when the boy in the movie went out in the snow in his underwear like it was nothing! Some Fin's even go rolling around in the snow naked after a sauna! If you want to study Finnish culture, this is an excellent movie to study. Of course, knowing these things aren't needed really when you watch the movie. You can still enjoy the movie if you don't have a strong Finnish understanding, but if you want, you can search the culture online & read up on it before you buy the movie.

That being said, My Husband was born & raised in Finland. I was lucky enough to travel there a few times, so that's how I know so much about this. I actually bought this film for my Husband as a Christmas present...Lets just say I got a bigger smile when he received this then when I gave him an $100 camera.

You shouldn't compare this movie to other movies (I read a review that ""It's the next 'Christmas Story'""?) since it is from another country most people have no knowledge of & is on a totally different plain, & you'll start to expect things that are totally different then the Finnish norm.

I also was a film student for 2 years & I loved picking about this movie. It really was enjoyable to watch since it had a great storyline too. However, I did feel like the ending wasn't as good as it could have been (but still, I felt the majority of it was well worth the watch). It is a bit more dark then the mini short films though (though the second mini film is the closest to what the movie is like; much darker). The movie is almost a type of physiological horror, where as the mini shorts are more comedic.",1323734400,16,3852,4.366806136680614
4532363,2,B0052WKZY2,"I learned a lesson from this movie as it seems that other Amazoners have learned too, ""YOU CANNOT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS ON THE MOVIES"" On the back of this movie this movie was said to be a FUTURE Christmas Classic, compared to Joe Dante's Gremlins, etc...I gave it a shot.

When I read the back of the case, I was like this movie is going to be AWESOME!!! The story line was right up my alley and I love when a dark twist is put on something ""magical"" and ""happy"". However, this one falls short...right when things start looking like they are going to start picking up, it ends...you never see the ""Evil Santa Clause"", there's absolutely NO ACTION, and besides an ocassional eating of gingerbread and some weak Christmas lights (that the boys father never wants on to begins with) you would never know this was Christmas movie. Its very random...and the story goes nowhere.

I will admit that it was a clever idea without a proper budget and because of this, the movie suffered, but this movie could have been outstanding. In the meantime, rent it, and make your own decision. You may love it, everyones different.",1323734400,11,1112,4.582914572864322
4532364,4,B0052WKZY2,"I've been waiting what seems like a very long time to see this and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The Blu-ray makes the stark landscape just amazing to behold, the audio is also very good. I'm not going to go into the story all that much because enough has been said and spoiled by others. I thought this was well acted, considering the characters are from a land that looks so harsh. I expect them to be of few words but the compassion shows through in the father and son relationship that I found not only believable but heart warming at the end. This isn't for everyone but it was for me. Now I hope these film makers do a Krampus story next.",1323475200,,651,4.216
4532365,2,B0052WKZY2,"I'm not sure if the reviewers watched the same movie I did. While the premise of the movie is interesting: the ""real"" Santa Clause being found in a burial mound, it never lives up to its potential. The first hour of the movie is incredibly boring, with nothing happening at all. Just when you think some major plot twist will happen, it doesn't. Hell, you don't even SEE the monster Santa. The final 30 minutes of the movie are alright, but still average at best. I hate how they never explored the origins of the monster Santa deeper than simply saying ""The ancient people buried him here"". I was excited in the beginning of the film, because I thought we would be able to go inside the burial mound and we would be treated to some cool, indiana jones-like exploration. But no, they don't even give us that. Instead, the film shifts to some dumb kid and his reindeer-herding father. This entire movie is a miss. I say avoid it, you could definitely do better in terms of foreign, dark fantasy films. The Troll Hunter is definitely much better than this.",1323475200,7,1054,4.523560209424084
4532366,4,B0052WKZY2,"Friends,

  I'd been wanting to see this movie for over a year.  IMDB had the trailers in late 2010, and I thought it would be in U.S. theaters for the holidays.  It MAY have shown elsewhere in the country, but to my knowledge NEVER came to Saint Louis.  So now it's the holiday season of 2011, and it's out on video.  It's not quite what I thought it was going to be.  There is a bit of a twist at the end (Santa is not always what you think!!!), and if you've seen the short movies which inspired it, this movie actually fit's in well with those.  This movie is irreverent in the same way that ""Santa Clause Conquers the Martians"" was irreverent.  You take an established icon (Santa) and do something outlandish with it to create a movie that people will be talking about for years to come.  But don't get me wrong.  It's NOT an American production, it's Finnish.  So things that children can see over there without parental supervision have earned the movie an R rating in the U.S..  The primary focus of the movie spends most of it buck naked with his... north pole exposed to the arctic cold.  And there is also some expletive laced language.  But overall a great movie with an young hero who saves the day in the truest Spielberg-ian tradition.  If you like off-the-wall stories, Rare Exports will not disappoint.

4532367,5,B0052WKZY2,"Excellent movie with a very dark, unique twist on Santa Claus.

But, hey, it's integral to the plot and it's good to shake up your expectations once in a while!

Not for kids unless you've got some really wild and unconventional kids, and even then probably too scary for anyone young enough to still be wondering if Santa Claus is real -- it could be nightmare fodder for years if you push those limits.",1524182400,,661,4.798245614035087
