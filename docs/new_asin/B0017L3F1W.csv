smart, witty, and funny.  Thoroughly enjoyable!",1506470400,,199,5.419354838709677
8600181,4,B0017L3F1W,"This movie is a typical filipino ""corny"" love story. I have enjoyed watching Richard Gutierrez as well as Marian Rivera. After watching several of their films, I must admit they are pretty good especially Richard Gutierrez. The story line was all right, but as I said it is a typical corny filipino love story.",1279411200,,310,4.7592592592592595
