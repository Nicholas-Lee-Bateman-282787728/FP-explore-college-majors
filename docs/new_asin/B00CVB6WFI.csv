5742813,5,B00CVB6WFI,"CATTLE KING is a fine, if under appreciated, little Western that came out (1963) at the end of the great heyday of film Westerns. Starring Robert Taylor, and with a very capable supporting cast that includes Ray Teal, Robert Middleton, Joan Caulfield, and Malcolm Atterbury, CATTLE KING has the advantage of veterans Nat Holt as producer and Paul Sawtell for the musical score. It is certainly one of the most magnificently-filmed oaters of the period, with breathtaking and colorful scenery framing almost every scene.

But more interesting--and impressive--for me has always been the tight and well-crafted script, and the fine, no-nonsense acting of Robert Taylor. Certainly, Taylor was never that much identified with the Western genre, but during his career in Hollywood he made about fifteen oaters, and most of them were good to, in a few cases, remarkably good. It helped, of course, that MGM backed the product. But Taylor also turned in some very believable and memorable performances; his sympathetic portrayal of the plight of the American Indian in DEVIL'S DOORWAY, his role as a wagon master with a wagon train composed mostly of women in William Wellman's WESTWARD THE WOMEN, his straight-arrow cavalry role in AMBUSH, and his last sagebrush undertaking, RETURN OF THE GUNFIGHTER (1967), demonstrate that Taylor was not just the dependable Hollywood matinee idol, but an extremely believable Western star, as well.

Ever since I saw CATTLE KING years ago, I've always liked it; it never fails to engage me. Although I know the story and the eventual outcome, the film repays repeated viewing, and I can't say that for all the films I watch! Several writers on Westerns mention that CATTLE KING has a ""message,"" and it is true that Taylor seems to stand for conserving the Teton range area of Wyoming. The film fits into an historical period, 1883, and with the appearance in the film of President Chester Arthur, certain historical questions emerge. But they mostly serve as a backdrop to the film's action, and there is plenty of it.

Western fans, fans of Robert Taylor, and devotees of action films, will not be disappointed. The print is beautiful and full screen. I recommend this release highly, and not just to old cowpokes like me!",1371427200,14,2254,5.021390374331551
5742814,4,B00CVB6WFI,"""Cattle King"" is the last film Robert Taylor made under his MGM contract. His full-time contract had ended in 1959 but he agreed to do three more pictures. ""Cattle King"" is the third. Mr. Taylor plays a large scale cattle rancher whose living is being threatened by a Texas cartel who want to build a cattle highway from Texas to Canada. This would bring thousands of undesirable cattle to Mr. Taylor's Wyoming home. It's a nice twist on the old cattle ranchers vs. sheep herders story. Instead of wanting to leave the range free for cattle to roam, Sam Brassfield (Mr. Taylor) wants to fence in land for the controlled breeding of high quality bovines. The only sheep herder in the picture ends up siding with Brassfield. The cinematography is outstanding with a pallette that brings out the beauty of the area near Yellowstone Park. There are numerous scenes of groups of people riding which must have looked wonderful on the big screen. The acting is done by seasoned professionals like Robert Middleton, Ray Teal and William Windom and a newcomer, Robert Loggia. They are all excellent. As usual in westerns, Joan Caulfield as the love interest for Sam isn't given enough to do. President Chester A. Arthur (Larry Gates) plays a pivotal role. In many ways  Robert Taylor's colleagues at MGM made this a warm farewell. The name Robert Taylor fills the screen from top to bottom in the credits. He is photographed lovingly with numerous close-ups. There's a wonderful scene where Mr. Taylor stands proudly, legs apart in the western stance facing his enemy when the camera slides into a screen filling close-up. Robert Taylor was very good at playing characters who were larger than life, people who made a difference without losing their integrity. There's even a bit of humor as he spends a fair amount of time fussing with his various ties. ""Cattle King"" is a solid, well-acted, beautifully photographed western.",1405209600,,1917,4.898461538461539

I thought that this movie would be equally entertaining.  I didn't find it as good as Return of a Gunfighter. The Cattle king movie is well made, everyone has acted quite well, and I like to location where the film was shot.  I think that this is a must watch for those who love westerns",1455148800,,433,4.192771084337349

8586769,4,B00CVB6WFI,"As we learn in Tay Garnett's minor 1963 western, the term ""Cattle King"" has a pejorative meaning, that of a land-grabbing bovine baron. But as Robert Taylor plays the largest cattle rancher in his part of Wyoming, Sam Brassfield is anything but an evil man. In fact he does everything he can to preserve his and his neighbors' properties from the attempted encroachment of the story's villain, an obese Texan named Clay Matthews (Robert Middleton), who wants to turn the clock back, tear down all the fences, and herd his Texas longhorns on a path to Canada. These cattle drives would, for locals, mean the destruction of valuable grasslands and resources.

Sam Brassfield knows this, but short of all-out war on the itinerant cowboys, he'll do whatever possible to preserve his friends' best interests. It's Matthews' intention to recreate an open range so his herds can move north, unfettered by barbed wire. He tells lies about Brassfield in an attempt to turn alliy neighbors into enemies. and even uses gunslinging assassin Vince Bodine (Richard Devon) to stir up big trouble by cutting fence wire, burning homes and rustling cattle. A visit by Pres. Chester Arthur, who actually once came to the Yellowstone area, is another complication and an opportunity for Matthews to estabish an official National Cattle Trail.

If the film's plotline follows the classic pattern, clearly Clay and Sam are due for a clash, despite the latter's peaceable nature.

Robert Taylor gives his typical performance, a bit stiff but always watchable. A nice surprise is Robert Loggia as Taylor's right hand man, Johnny Quatro. It's hard to even recognize him behind the dust and that Mexican accent. Quatro BTW is a real range lothario. Everywhere he goes Johnny has any number of affectionate ""cousins"" doting on him.

Despite a decade-plus difference in their ages, Joan Caulfield as Sharleen Travers is the necessary love interest for Taylor. Her cowardly and alcoholic brother Harry is played by William Windom. It's a thankless role that Windom manages to shine in.

Highlights are of course the violent climax, plus a stampede that leads up to it.

This Metrocolor widescreen western is much better than its current 5.7 IMDb rating and is recommended for all fans of the genre.",1437696000,2,2269,5.037333333333334
