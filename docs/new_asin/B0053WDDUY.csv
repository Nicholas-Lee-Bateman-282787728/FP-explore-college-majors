8455800,3,B0053WDDUY,I love everything that I have ordered from Two little hands productions except that this was not what I thought it was. The main theme was supposed to be Bible Fun and that was not the case. The Bible signs were only in the book and not the DVD. The Bible signs should have been on the DVD. We already knew most of the signs on the DVD from other DVD's we've ordered. Why would you make a Bible Fun kit and not put the Bible signs in the DVD?,1424822400,,442,3.922222222222222
