8337196,5,B001R23GXI,"Unlike the other reviewers here, I see this production as representative of the aesthetic and zeitgeist of our age. The maker(s) of this film obviously understands the place our modern culture occupies within the full panorama of human history. Marvelous. Like Jackson Pollack and abstract expressionism in response to the era of Dada-ism... deceptively brilliant!",1373500800,,364,5.636363636363637
8337197,1,B001R23GXI,"Amazon should seriously Remove this DVD from their list, it is of the lowest standards possible. It mentions basically nothing about Aristotle apart from a few low res images downloaded from the internet and displayed in a powerpoint. The same goes for the 'human brain' poor quality images taken from the internet no real content. This is by far the worst thing i have ever bought in my entire life.",1250208000,4,400,4.728571428571429
8337198,1,B001R23GXI,This is not an Aristotle movie like the editor said. This is a power point presentation with bad quality images. It's a bad joke! Don't buy!,1239235200,5,140,4.423076923076923
