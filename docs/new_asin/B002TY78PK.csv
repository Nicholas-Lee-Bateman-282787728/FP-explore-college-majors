If you have any interest in the History of Nazi Germany what-so-ever, this is a must have.",1267056000,3,260,4.886363636363637

WWII buffs and historians will be delighted even upward to 5-stars and beyond with the inside information of what took place beside the ruthless Nazi Hitler. For viewers who thrive on continual education, this will enlighten you about the enemy of WWII, not just the ""bodyguard"" element. It you seek 'light' entertainment, keep in mind this Athena DVD is a documentary, a very good one, and sometimes graphic.

This 13 episode DVD set contains astonishing historical photos and film in sienna, B&W, and color.  Some film segments or portraits are used repeatedly in different episodes as the footage is used to visualize the expert commentary continually being presented by the narrator, Robert Powell (also on the SUBTITLE option.)  The repetition suggests the DVD could have been shorter in length, but because it was initially presented as segments on TV, the repeated views were important for each episodes' portion of the story that was being highlighted on that day.

This series is not just about the many bodyguards. But it is the story of the man, Adolf Hitler, his rise to political fame, his ruthless pursuit to conquer Europe, his eventual fall, and his need for protecting himself.  It's a combined series of Hitler AND the teams of bodyguards including the escort command, Gestapo, headquarters guard, RSD, internal security, SA, SD, and the fierce SS. The series tells of their beginning to end, leaders to traitors, and members closest to Hitler. Details previously undisclosed. There are live eyewitness interviews with some of the German survivors of these groups.

Although Hitler was a ruthless and ugly ruler, part of the history of the 1930s and 1940s Germany is told in an extensively detailed and accurate way as part of the German Political and War story that has seen little prior attention. Hitler's life and evil humanity history survived because of a unique system of personal guards, no regular schedule, frequent last minute changes, unpredictability, rivalry among guards and leaders, layered protection and, ultimately, chance.

Included in episodes are photos, film, diagrams, and commentary in detail about the cars (Episode #8), planes (#9), and trains (#10) used by Hitler and the adaptations created for his protection. It tells of the key personnel who operated them. Great nostalgic views of old transportation.

Over 40 attempts on Hitlers life over 25 years. Why were none successful? This documentary series tries to answer that question. It also leads the viewer to consider 'What would the world be like if Hitler's Bodyguard had NOT been successful?'  Or on occasions when the bodyguards were instigators, ""What would have happened had they killed Hitler, the man and institution?""

It's a thought provoking, and emotional series. A ""Churchill's Bodyguard"" companion.
Extras include ""A Viewer's Guide"" booklet filled with episode highlights, questions to ponder, photos, bibliography, Bodyguard Who's Who, and a description of each unit. A list and description of films made about Hitler assassination attempts. Photo galleries on each disc and...
SUBTITLES, extremely helpful with the German names and locations.

3986614,5,B002TY78PK,"Watched it on military channel. So I had to buy. Very detailed, especially liked the contempt between Himmler, and Gesche. Amazing nobody ever got the job done on Adolph. Kind of makes you wonder if he was put here by some dark force to fulfill a certain destinyJust sayin'...",1393718400,4,276,4.653061224489796
3986615,4,B002TY78PK,The best way not to repeat history is to learn about it. This series about Hitler's Bodyguard does just that,1391385600,,108,4.45
3986616,5,B002TY78PK,"This documentary contains all the items that make up an enlightening documentary. It has great detailed facts, unseen video footage, pictures, and intriguing content. Hitler's Bodyguard dvd makes a great companion to the book entitled 'Killing Hitler', a book covering all the assassination plots targeting Hitler before and during WW 2. As a student of history, primarily focusing on this time period, I would highly recommend it to those even mildly interested in the subject. It will definitely open your eyes to information previously unknown.",1377216000,2,547,5.447058823529412
3986617,4,B002TY78PK,"Excellent  series with  great footage ,etc.  I  couldn't give it  5 stars  because the  actor who does  Hitler's voiceover in the film  is totally obnoxious to listen to .  It sounds sort of like this: "" I vant to rule zee vorld arrgg chew  carpet !""  lol  I somehow don't believe Hitler would sound like that. But anyway, great dvd.",1334275200,2,333,4.35
3986618,5,B002TY78PK,"Can anyone doubt that Hitler had the most fascinating life ever? With rock-star performances he put Germany's millions into ecstasy to start, and into total despair to finish, a whole nation turned bipolar. This from a man who was next to homeless in his youth. He was a tempting target, but his incredible luck, unpredictability and huge bodyguard protection saved him. This excellent documentary is the best Hitler history I have seen, amazingly detailed. The best read: Hitler by Ian Kershaw, a 2-volume set.",1305244800,3,511,5.095238095238095
3986619,5,B002TY78PK,"I caught random episodes of this incredible series on the Military Channel but missed quite a few.  I was so happy to see the entire set available on DVD.  This four disc set is an outstanding documentary on Hitler and the many assassination attempts on his life from the beginning of his political life to the point when he took his own life on April 30, 1945.  Each episode in the series goes into great detail about how his rise in power resulted in an ever-increasing number of enemies that wanted to see him dead.  This series highlights documents, photographs and archive footage in a way that gives the viewer an up close look at this fascinating but maniacal leader of the Nazi party.  It is amazing that anyone could survive over 40 assassination attempts, but this series shows how Hitler's erratic behavior and unpredictable and frequent change of plans were the basis of his escape from death.  Hitler truly believed he had been chosen for a divine mission and began to think he was immortal.  The other great aspect of this series is the in depth look at the circle of officers and bodyguards that surrounded him till the end.  A DEFINITE must see for anyone interested in World War II.  Even the most learned history buff will learn something new!  There at least one other documentary in this series called Churchill's Bodyguards, however, I have not seen any of the episodes.",1284163200,7,1391,4.68724279835391
3986620,4,B002TY78PK,"How did Hitler manage to survive more than 40 assassination attempts? -- some by his own generals!

Using captured SS documents and eyewitness interviews, this detailed documentary reveals the secrets of Hitler's elite bodyguards who swore loyalty oaths to the Fuhrer himself.  It shows how Hitler created rivalries among his closest guards to ensure his own safety, and how his unpredictable behavior - by design and chance - saved his life numerous times.

Episodes include: How Hitler's Bodyguard Worked, Early Attempts on Hitler's Life, Jewish...Attempts to Kill Hitler, Dangerous Car Journeys, Attempts to Kill Hitler at the Wolf's Lair, Poison Gas Plot in the Bunker and more.

Carefully assembled obscure historical footage from many archives, much of it never seen by the general public, reveals rare glimpses inside Hitler's infamous strongholds - including the Berghof, the Wolf's Lair and the Berlin Bunker.  Effective computer generated graphics make plain the unusual security measures used on Hitler's trains, planes and cars.  I liked the meticulous re-enactments that bring to vivid life many of the lost incidents documented here.

This exceptional historical record, first broadcast on Discovery's Military Channel, is a truly riveting look at how one of the 20th century's more evil tyrants (there were others like Mao and Stalin) managed to survive as long as he did.

This amazing production is from the same British team of Philip Nugus and Jonathan Martin, who are also responsible for the acclaimed historical documentaries CHURCHHILL'S BODYGUARD and THE CENTURY OF WARFARE.",1267660800,18,1598,5.441295546558704

8380778,4,B002TY78PK,"Excellent documentary series, particularly episodes detailing Hitler's aircraft, motorcades and train transport. There is, however, one flaw that rendered minus one star in this review and that is Hitler's voice. In normal conversation, Hitler did not speak in such a terse, angry tome. The producers of this series should have modeled the actor's voice portraying Hitler to match Hitler's conversation with Field Marshal Mannerheim, secretly recorded in 1942.",1475884800,2,460,5.779411764705882
