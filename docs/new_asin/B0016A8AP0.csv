3154672,5,B0016A8AP0,I am an ex-football player that was looking for something else besides the typical gym workout and was recommended by a friend of mine to try Yoga.  Being in San Diego there are so many options and I didn't know where to start.  I found Christina's class and fell in love with the the techniques and skill level she teaches at.  The fact that I have taken her class is the reason why I purchased this video.  This has some easy poses but challenges you at the same time.  A couple times a week when I need to strech and realx I use this video to find my center.  This is a great video to purchase for anyone looking to begin Yoga or even for someone advanced that needs that gentle relaxation.  I highly recommend this.,1209081600,3,719,4.242647058823529
3154673,5,B0016A8AP0,"What a fresh approach and creative way to engage the experienced yogi, as well as the beginner, to really appreciate the art and practice of yoga.  Experiencing her peaceful voice guiding my practice was soothing, along with the beautiful scenery and ocean in the backround -- to me, this DVD experience is a way to privately gain the yoga benefits in your home while feeling like you're truly surrounded by the tides rolling in from the water when you close your eyes.
Excellent --- what a great way to start your day or close it out.",1209081600,2,535,4.572916666666667
3154674,5,B0016A8AP0,"This video is ideal for anyone who wants to practice yoga at their own pace - - in their own space.  What's really cool is that you can choose to have Chrissy's groovy soothing voice lead you into all poses each time you watch it, or you can change the background and music to just have timed-poses with no instruction.  This makes a huge difference when you are watching this over and over again.

The way this video combines a gentle Kripalu approach with a flowing Vinyasa style really helps to individualize a workout, energization level and sense of being each time you watch it.  Practice yoga with this and you'll find your flow!",1207958400,14,636,4.552631578947368
3154675,5,B0016A8AP0,"Wow! This one is unique! It is the first one I have found which allows the viewer to select type of music AS WELL AS instructional level, which I found keeps me coming back for more. On this video, there are three levels of instruction available, as well as three varied musicians. (For example:you might choose to have as your only audible cue the NAME of each asana, rather than having to listen to detailed instruction.) In addition, Pedersen has a soothing, motivating voice -- ideal for creating the atmosphere most of us are seeking in a great Vinyasa video. The flow itself is terrific; fluid movements and the requisite sun salutations set you on your journey, followed later by the necessary advanced balance poses and SUPER core work. This video really stands out as the one that covers ALL the bases -- perfect for all ages -- welcoming, yet challenging. Highly recommended!",1206748800,6,885,4.790849673202614

3154677,5,B0016A8AP0,"This video has inspired me to practice yoga nearly every day. The setting is absolutely breathtaking, and the music very relaxing and perfect for the poses. Christinas voice is very calming and enjoyable to listen to.
The flow is great for all levels of yogi, and a wonderful addition to your morning routine!
Enjoy, I high recommend it!",1206403200,,337,4.827586206896552
3154678,5,B0016A8AP0,"This is one of my favourite yoga DVDs because it offers enough challenges through a flow that also encourages the practitioner to turn his or her spirit inward. Pedersen's voice is firm yet soft, and this perhaps best describes her routine, which also distinguishes itself in the two following ways. First, she begins the DVD with a warmup flow that is not a sun salutation. This is a nice variation from other routines. Second, although most poses are traditional, a few stray from the beaten path and thus provide a fresh approach to one's practice. Finally, the cinematography underscores the stunning beauty of the beach backdrop.",1218067200,,634,4.990566037735849
3154679,3,B0016A8AP0,"Kind of disapointed with this DVD. It is for beginner/intermediate levels, I was expecting something more challenging.
Though it is nice to see and follow the outdoors practice, production could be more careful with the views, cleanse the camera'a lense, etc.

The sequence is very repetitive (eg. the warrior sequence at the beginning) and the instructor is never steady at the poses, she's always moving  giving the impression that she cant stabilize herself.... I've seen better and more professional DVDs. I also got Vinyasa Flow by Maral Hadidi, muchhh better and a lot more challenging and professional!",1217030400,8,609,5.268041237113402

3154681,5,B0016A8AP0,"I love this yoga video! I bought it about a month ago now and I have been doing it almost every morning since I received it. I can already see such a difference in my arms, my core and my legs have even gotten tighter and more toned! I have been doing yoga now for over a year and I really like this style!... not only is it extremely stress relieving, I find it to be more effective than other styles of yoga that I have tried in the past. This is such a great video to have at home! Instead of having to wake up early to get to the gym, I can get a really great yoga session in my own home and it has proven to be a great way to start the day. I have been more awake at work and I feel so much better all around. A really nice bonus to this video is that you can pick different styles of music to listen to and because if offers so many different options, you don't get sick of it... even if you are doing it every day! Plus, I gotta say... I moved away from the beach about two years ago and have missed it every day that I have been gone.

The poses were challenging, which I like in a video. Namely, I like it because the challenge helps to remind me that I am stretching my body's limits and actually working mentally and physically.  In addition, I love the fact that you can vary your routine a bit in that there are a few different musical accompaniments. All in all, I definately found it helpful and really can attest to the fact that my concentration and general state of mind were more centered because of the practice.

3154683,5,B0016A8AP0,I have been practicing yoga for three years. I started with the free TV and graduated by taking classes at the gym. I don't get to the gym as much as I would like and the class schedules just aren't convenient. A friend of mine told me about Christina Pedersens new video. I was blown away. Before work I turn it on and get into the perfect frame of mind to start my day. I love the soothing effect of the ocean and the way Christina raises the bar. You will enjoy this great video.,1210550400,,482,4.08421052631579
3154684,5,B0016A8AP0,"I have just recently found interest in Yoga and as a beginner, was concerned this may be too advanced. I was pleasantly surpised to find that this DVD had a little bit for everyone. I could easily follow Christina Pedersen's calming voice through the moves and although I need some practice, can see myself continuing to use this as I become stronger and more confident in Yoga.

The setting is beautiful and it truly offers a sense of peace and calm as you ease your way from move to move.

I have bought it now for three friends and family members and they feel the same. I look forward to a sequel.

The DVD has not disappointed. The music selections are wonderful and the workout is just the right pace for an intermediate yoga student. Christina's voice is soothing. There are a few poses on the DVD that I cannot do (Wild Thing, Crow) but it's easy to substitute an alternative pose as the sequence runs.

Despite using the video about once a month (and on accasion more frequently) for the last 2 years, it has not become boring or mundane.  Thanks to Christina for creating a great yoga DVD.",1285372800,,722,4.4961832061068705
8261867,3,B0016A8AP0,"I guess I was expecting more from this DVD.  I have been practicing on and off for two years, and do not consider myself to be a particularly advanced yogi.  Except for one asana, where she is balancing on her forearms with one leg extended, the practice is very doable.  Her vinyasas are unusual, going into down dog from forward bend and then plank to chataranga.  Why she puts an extra down dog in, I can't figure, and it doesn't seem to add anything to the practice.  Also the flow is SO slow that it doesn't really follow how a normal person breathes, even with ujiyi (or however you spell it)breath  -- you stay in a posture much longer than it actually takes to breathe in or out, which makes the practice choppy rather than flowing.  I also feel, at least at the begining, that she is repeating the same motions again in a choppy way -- I'm reminded of the 80s fad of bouncing when you held a stretch -- in fact, she and her colleagues do just that in some of the poses, which most trainers and sports medicine people suggest is a bad idea.  Finally, I think someone else commented on the fact that her own balance doesn't seem to be great, which seems like a prerequisite for guiding a practice, plus she keeps fussing with her bra which is not very zen-like.

If you are going to spend $20 on a yoga video, there are likely to be better ones out there.  Scenery is lovely and being able to change the music is a swell gimmick, but you aren't really supposed to be looking at the scenery when you are practicing anyway.",1247616000,6,1528,4.311188811188811
8261868,5,B0016A8AP0,"I've done this DVD twice already and I felt amazing during and afterwards. I liked it better than Maral Hadidi's DVD which is somewhat similar but I found Christina's practice actually slightly more challenging and it is shorter (75 minutes). It starts with a 3 minute meditation and gentle stretches on the floor and moves up to a non traditional salutation including warrior 2 , reverse warrior and extended angle in a continuous flow , a little bit similar to Shiva Rea's style. One reviewer claimed this was repetitive but all sun salutations are , at least it wasn't the regular a & b salutations. The standing pose flow includes goddess pose , triangle and a challenging balance flow with dancer's pose , half moon , tree , extended hand to big toe pose and warrior 3. It continues with an advanced arm balance (Eka Pada Koundiyanasana II) , side plank , pigeon , backbends and inversions and ends with a long shavasana. The production and beach setting are great and there is 8 audiotracks to choose from - 4 music options (including no music) with full instruction and the same 4 with cuing only. Overall a great challenging yet relaxing practice.",1242259200,8,1155,4.7227722772277225
8261869,4,B0016A8AP0,"I really enjoyed this DVD.  It has a nice slow flow to it and does allow you time to adjust to a pose or work your way into a fairly difficult pose.  I think this is a solid intermediate level DVD, there are some challenging poses in the way of back bends and balance poses, but for the most part the DVD is doable.  My problems with this DVD was the occasional lighting where all you could see would be shadows (but I think that was to highlight the ocean scenery) and another sequence would have been good as well (either a shorter one of maybe 30-40 minutes or a longer one of 90 minutes or so).  Otherwise, this is a nice DVD, the instructor was really good, and look forward to more of her DVDs.  Overall this is DVD is more like 4.5 stars.",1222387200,3,745,4.110344827586207
8261870,3,B0016A8AP0,"The content is pretty good but the picture quality can be pretty bad at times.  A lot of the shots are dark, so you can't really see what they are doing.  You see shadows of the people and a beautiful background of the beach.",1221955200,,225,4.090909090909091
8261871,4,B0016A8AP0,"I have been practicing yoga for a while and although I still use and enjoy my beginner to intermediate videos, I needed to add a little more challenge to my practice.  This Vinyasa Flow Yoga video is just about perfect for the intermediate level.

The video is broken up into asanas, any of which you can easily skip if you don't want to/don't have time to/don't feel comfortable.  All you do is push the ""skip/next scene"" button on your DVD remote and you are immediately taken to the next asana.  I really like this feature.

Also, there are three different types of music you can pick to listen to as the background for the DVD.  I think this is a great feature because the music really does build, ebb, and flow in keeping with the asanas.  The music helps you stay at the right energy level.

There is also an option to turn the instructor's voice off and have a timing sort of ""metronome"" to remind you of when to switch poses, etc.  I haven't used this yet, but I'm sure I will after a while, as I start to memorize and become tired of hearing all the instructions over and over :)

In the balancing asanas, towards the end, there are some pretty advanced poses.  I am one of those people who looks at the yoga girls on screen and thinks ""if they can do it then I can do it!"" and therefore I have definitely been challenged to perfect (or, in one case, even PERFORM) a few of the advanced poses.  But I did buy this video hoping for a challenge, so I am glad there are things on the DVD that I can't already do.  It gives me something to work toward.  I'd say 90% of the asanas are intermediate and I had no problem with them, and then 10% are advanced and I have varying levels of difficulty with the poses.

The only real negative thing I can think of is that the DVD only has one lesson on it.  Lots of yoga videos have several different lessons you can choose from (arms focus, legs focus, full body flow, etc).  This DVD has ONE LESSON, and that's it.  So if you're looking for a more diverse practice tool, this is probably not your best pick.

All said, I enjoy this DVD quite a bit, and am very happy that I have added it to my collection.  From being able to skip through asanas and make the practice length fit with my schedule, to picking my own music, to having challenging poses to work towards, it has been a good fit all around.",1218153600,5,2350,4.226457399103139
