679992,2,6303566685,I don't have a lot to say about this movie except that it is not your typical mob drama and the family tragedy spewed on some major depression. This movie was not what I expected and the storyline had too many holes in it.,980985600,,222,4.068181818181818

680250,5,6303566685,"So, the comment section of my `Forrest Gump' review has been abuzz lately with criticisms of me calling 1994 a subpar year in general for film.  I'm not going to get into that here, but I found it rather ironic that that was sparked in the recent days, since I've been brushing up on films from 1994 recently and have become more and more convinced that my original assessment was correct.  There are a lot of good films that came out in that particular year, but not a lot of truly great ones.

With that in mind, I just got done watching one small film that I do feel is great, possibly one of the best of the year, and so this is for you Beany.

James Gray is one of those directors that has a pretty loyal fanbase.  He's only directed five films, one of them not released yet, and yet his style and atmospheric presence has attained him a cult following.  His dedication to the crime drama (diverting lately with his last two films) has formulated a niche for him that many find alluring and commanding.  I really liked both `We Own the Night' and `Two Lovers' (I haven't seen `The Yards') and yet I was bewildered a tad by his fans because neither film struck me as anything remarkable.

`Little Odessa' is a different story.

This debut film from Gray paints a bleak and grungy picture of the crime underbelly and the ways it leeches onto a particular family and tears them apart.  Joshua, the black sheep of the family, has disappeared for some time and is working for the Russian mob.  Called back to his hometown for a job, he reunites with his younger brother Reuben and finds himself at odds with his domineering and disapproving father.  With his mother on her deathbed, and his presence causing a stir with some local thugs, Joshua attempts to bond with his brother and say his goodbyes to his mother, all the while keeping a low profile and cleaning up a messy job.

It doesn't work out as he planned.

Gray established such tone with this film, creating a lingering tension that permeates every scene.  The cast is very good here, with Tim Roth nailing not only an accent but also the stern accountability and cold swagger his character has to exude.  Vanessa Redgrave is also very good, especially with the physicality of her role, but it is Maximilian Schell who was the brightest surprise here.  The way he handles his depiction of the father, Arkady, was flawless.  Such pent up frustration and anger and such calloused pain and internal suffering.  He balanced out each aspect of his character's development with sharp understanding and control.

So, for a year that produced very little to get overly excited over, `Little Odessa' proved to be a staggering surprise and a true gem of a film!",1375920000,4,2712,4.56404958677686
680251,4,6303566685,"Very strong performances by a great cast make this movie mesmerizing.  It's dark and somber and the outcome is inevitable, but I kept watching because of the believable family dynamics and the especially compelling performance by Tim Roth.  Good dialogue throughout.",1367798400,,266,5.463414634146342
680252,1,6303566685,"Billed as another Goodfellas, Little Odessa is the story of a mafia hitman returning home to do a job, as well as seeing the poor immigrant family he left behind. The story is great, the movie is not. Tim Roth is fantastic as the disowned, disgraced, murderous son. Roth always gives a very strong performance and does so again here. Edward Furlong, one of my favorites, unfortunately does not do as well. I've seen him in enough things to know, it's not his fault, it's the writing. This film is so dark and painfully slow that I barely made it through. Very little is explained and the dialogue is laughable, even at times non-existent. There are huge plot holes to go along with an ending that makes little sense. The writer was trying to tell his story more through imagery and symbolism in a genre that is based on action. You can't pull off something like this without explaining more of the story and using it to move things along. It's not the worst film I've ever seen, but to be honest, I was bored from start to finish.",1361577600,,1030,4.455026455026455
680253,4,6303566685,"This movie is engaging from the moment the opening scene takes place when Tim Roth quickly makes a hit on a mark and then leaves the scene without being seen by any witnesses. The viewer is then intrigued by the phone conversation he has with his client and is told that he must do a hit in little Odessa.  Immediately the audience begins wondering why this assassin does not want to return to Brooklyn.  Tim Roth, as usual, does an incredible job portraying the two sides of a hired murderer's personality.  One side is an efficient, cold minister of death while the other side portrays a sensitive, compassionate, and yet vulnerable human being capable of showing great love for his dying mother and younger brother while hating his abusive father. This exciting and poignant movie has an ending which is realistic in its portrayal a cold-blooded killer, however, I am always a sucker for a happy ending though it would probably been impossible in light of the carnage that was left when Tim Roth returned to his hometown.",1355875200,2,1024,4.741573033707865
680254,5,6303566685,"Tim Roth is mesmerizing as Joshua, a Russian-American hitman returning to his Brooklyn neighborhood (the Russian-Jewish enclave of Brighton Beach) for a job that forces him to confront his past, dark relations with his family and gang cronies. He meets up with his impressionable younger brother (a superb Furlong), confronts his mean-spirited, philandering father and learns his mother is dying of cancer. Very deep and powerful New York ethnic crime drama will haunt long after its done. Filmed on location during a brutal early 90s East Coast winter, it is Roth's unforgettable portrayal of the icy protagonist that ultimately brings this gritty gangster flick to full life. The supporting cast is brilliant as well, especially Furlong and Guilfoyle. BUT there is bad news: the DVD is very poor quality and better off watching it on Amazon instant video. Hopefully an updated distributor or blu-ray will come about. That aside, 'Little Odessa' is one of the most haunting crime dramas I've ever seen.",1323475200,4,1003,5.197530864197531
680255,4,6303566685,"""Little Odessa,"" (1994), written and directed by James Gray, is a remarkably powerful and effective, award-winning crime drama set among the Russian community in present-day Brooklyn, New York.  At its heart, it's a tale of a dysfunctional family that has lost its way in its new American life.  And it's been given a top-drawer cast, all of whom fully inhabit their roles.  Arkady Shapira, played by Maximilian Schell, is the unhappy father of this brood: in Russia, he was a respected man; in Brooklyn he runs a newsstand.  Irina, his wife, played by the superb Vanessa Redgrave, is suffering from a brain tumor.  Tim Roth, in one of his best performances, is their disaffected son Joshua; he's become a professional hit man, and long exiled himself from family and neighborhood.  Edward Furlong plays his confused younger brother Reuben.  Moira Kelly turns in a fine performance as Alla Shustervich, former girlfriend of Roth's character.

Life and death business brings Roth's character back to Brooklyn's Brighton Beach neighborhood;it resembles the Russian Odessa, as both lie on the sea.  It's bleak in winter, and he knows he should not return.  But return he does, yearning to restore relations with his family, over his father's objections.  It soon proves to have not been a good idea.

Those of us who lived in Brooklyn as the Russians came crowding in in the hundreds of thousands never quite knew what to make of them, nor, I suppose, do we yet.  But this is surely the Brooklyn we know, with its massive, solid, prewar buildings -- huge boilers in the basements -- in which entire families have been born, lived, and died.  And Gray's intense script has given his characters here dialog and usage that any Brooklynite would recognize, and these actors, most especially including the English Roth, have sure got the local accent.

The movie is as bleak in outlook and outcome as its wintry,dirty-snowy setting, and, in its specificity and verisimilitude, it earns its status as a solid gangster picture.",1205539200,7,2017,4.979104477611941
680256,4,6303566685,"This is a gripping and touching gangster movie classic that will have you totally immersed in its drama and personal issues of the heart.

The story sets in Brighton Beach, New York known as Little Odessa where the gangsters rule. Tim Roth is the fugitive hit man returning to his hometown to do another hit job and finds himself confronting issues of the heart and families, his younger brother (Edward Furlong) who adores him, his dying mother (Vanessa Redgrave), his abusive and cheating father (Maximilian Schell) and his girlfriend (Moira Kelly). As usual, Tim Roth never disappoints. The way he makes his Brooklyn accent subtly authentic and his character compelling, speaks volumes of his magnificent talents.  The poignant scene of him having to leave and embracing his dying mother is unforgettable. No one could remain unmoved by this sensitive and fine production",1196035200,,874,5.147887323943662

This is a strange movie.  The only well-known cast members that I knew of were Maximillian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave, and I never recognized them until I saw their names in the credits. They have aged, as have we all.  That is more a reflection on me than on the cast, no doubt, because I don't keep up with Hollywood's latest talent, and the ones I do recognize have changed.  But, they can still act! The cast is relatively scanty; the movie, however, is of high quality. No need for more cast members.

The color is muted, and it suits the film.  It is set in New York City, in Brooklyn. The film evokes emotion, but the acting, though skillful, is also muted.  Nothing is overstated. It is very well directed, obviously.

This is the story of a Russian Jewish hit-man, Joshua Shapira (Tim Roth) who is reluctantly returned to his home territory (Brooklyn), where he is a wanted man, for a contract killing.

Joshua finds that his mother, Irina (Vanessa Redgrave), is dying of a brain tumor, and his younger brother, Reuben (Edward Furlong) is cutting school, smoking dope, drinking, and generally headed for trouble. His father, Arkady (Maximillian Schell) is aware that he has failed in bringing up his oldest son.  He has a mistress. although he loves his wife.  Arkady rejects Joshua as a ""street rat,"" who is loved by Reuben and his mother, Irina. The whole story is fraught with pent-up emotion.  Execution scenes, although shown, are not overly graphic, although the film is rated ""R"" (probably for language).

It is made for mature audiences, but is of good quality throughout. I'm glad I saw it.  It has emotional impact.

680258,4,6303566685,"This 1994 film is set in Brighton Beach, the area of Brooklyn where Russians have settled.  It's a rough and gritty neighborhood and we meet a family with multiple problems.  The oldest son, Tim Roth, is a hit man for the mob who's been out of touch with his family for several years but has to come back to the neighborhood to carry out a murder.  His teenage brother adores him and follows him to all the wrong places.  The mother, played by Vanessa Redgrave, is dying of a brain tumor.  The father, played by Maximillian Schell, works hard all day at a newspaper stand, cheats on his wife and is brutal to his sons.  There is violence and murder throughout and the audience knows it will just get worse.

Usually, I complain because films like this are not realistic.  However, I felt just the opposite about this film.  It is almost too realistic, cruel and depressing.  And there is no bit of lightness to offset the somber mood.  I also felt some real emotion.  To me this was serious stuff.

Performances were uniformly excellent, especially that of Maximillian Schell.  He came across a real person with upsets and conflicts and bad choices.  Tim Roth, who is actually a British actor, managed to get the New York street accent just right.  The rest of the cast seemed completely authentic.  I especially liked the family's large run-down apartment and the scenes shot near the beach during the winter.  And the murders made me shudder because they were so very real.

The drama held my attention and let me feel the dilemma of this troubled family.  It ends sadly, as I expected it would.  And it is completely depressing.  However, I liked it and therefore recommend it.",1078444800,26,1680,4.623728813559322
