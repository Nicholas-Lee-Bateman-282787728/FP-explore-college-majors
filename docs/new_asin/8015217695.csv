1146392,4,8015217695,"Well, I have seen all of Mark Lowry's videos, and I love 'em all.  I have to say that this one is his worst, but it isn't too bad.  While all of his others get a 5 star rating from me, this gets a 4.  It has some rediculous  parts, and ""The Date Adventure"" is really stupid.  I would not  recommend this to someone who just wants one or two of Mark's videos, but  if you have the rest of them, I'd add this to your collection.  This would  be my last choice, but it's still worth it.",955584000,2,483,3.8469387755102042
1146393,2,8015217695,"Believe me, I am a huge Mark Lowry fan.  I've seen ""Remotely Controlled"" and ""My First Comedy Video"" and loved them.  I couldn't wait to see this one.  I wish I had waited.  This is a big dud.  90% of this movie is just stupid.  The rest is dumb. Now I know stupidity  is a big part of comedy, but not like this. The best song on the movie is  at the end with an old clip of him singing as a child on some old TV show  (at least, that's what it looks like. If not, they did a good job of making  the kid look like Mark).  ""Face in This World"" is ok.  The rest  are too dumb.  The short clips of concert footage is much worse than in his  other videos.  The only time I really laughed at something for a reason  other than how stupid it was, was when he says what he does when people  greet him in the morning.  If you are looking for an awesome Christion  comedy video pick up ""Remotely Controlled"" right now.  That is by  far the best.  All the music videos on this one look low budget and stupid.  I wish I could like this movie, but I can't.  Please don't let me make it  seem that Mark Lowry isn't good at comedy.  I would give ""Remotely  Controlled"" a 6 out of 5 if I could.  ""My First Comedy  Video"" is great too.  Please get those instead of this one!",955584000,7,1258,3.912

7900681,5,8015217695,"I hadn't seen this video in a long time and was pleased to find it available in any format (since the video's not available from Mark Lowry's website at all - just the cd). It's still just as funny as I remember, especially 'The Date Adventure' and 'Some Other Time, Some Other Place.' The latter was a funny duet with Mark Lowry begging Sandi Patty to sing with him (her answer was the song's title). I just wish he'd put it on dvd.",1231632000,2,433,4.228915662650603
7900683,5,8015217695,"The duet with Sandi Patti, the spoof on Amy Grant's ""Every Heartbeat,"" Mark and Steven Curtis Chapman's ""The Date Adventure,"" Michael W. Smith's ""Place in this World"" Mark  Lowry-style... I loved everything about this video!  I also appreciate  Mark's serious side as well.  His commentary along with the song,  ""This, Too, Shall Pass,"" has been a reminder to me many times  that God sees all things, and the troubled times always have an end.  This  video is definitly one to own.",962323200,7,481,4.851851851851852
