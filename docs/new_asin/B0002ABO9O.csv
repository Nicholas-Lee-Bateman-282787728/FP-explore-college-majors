This is exactly what I wanted and didn't find until now- a simple workout to target my upper body with simple tried and true exercises, No barbie dolls in skin tight spandex doing impossible girations that a normal person can't do. I would definitely buy this again, and willl recommend it to friends.",1180483200,7,335,4.694915254237288
8025088,5,B0002ABO9O,"I do this video 2-3 times a week and find that I get as good a workout as doing almost 45 mins of freeweights.  When I am done with this one, I feel my muscles burning.  This is the first time I have seen anyone do a set of exercises one at a time and then incorporate them all together.  YOu do a set of bicep curls, then lateral raises, overhead raises and tricep kickbacks.  Then you do 2 of each all together.  It was fun to do them that way.  This tape goes really fast and I would recommend it to anyone who is short of time, but want to do some strength training.",1109116800,17,570,3.9130434782608696
