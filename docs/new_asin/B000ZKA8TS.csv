8235775,5,B000ZKA8TS,"first its a ya entertainment (sadly out of business but their art is still around to be purchased)  so it's subtitles are near perfect.
second the lead actress is Choi Ji Woo.. someone who should be not only a Korean national treasure.. but a world national treasure.
then there is the story itself.  crushing untruth's piled upon a young lady.. but eventually the truth makes its way to the light.  One of the few Korean drama's that have a western like ending.  This box set was a must have for my korean drama collection.  I've watched it twice so far and will watch it again god willing.",1436745600,,591,4.485981308411215

8235777,5,B000ZKA8TS,"This was the second Korean drama I ever watched, and it set the bar so high that in 10 years since first seeing this show, I haven't found another drama that even comes close to how great this one is.

This show is very serious, which is just the kind of thing I love. I don't like comedic dramas where the characters act goofy and silly. It does have its funny moments, and a couple characters that provide comic relief now and again, but it's a serious drama at its core and never lets you forget. This show is also more ""adult"" than most popular dramas, with an attempted rape, attempted murder, and a double-suicide. You can't help but feel strongly about every person in the show, even supporting characters, whether you love or hate them.

The only things I found disappointing were the fact that the main character's best friend and her brother never resolved their potential romantic relationship by the end of the show (the friend was crushing on him and hinting heavily and he never seemed to ""get it""), and there's a scene where one of the characters finally regains his memories after a long bout of amnesia, and it's so anticlimactic when it should be absolutely tear-jerking. It's hard for me to forgive those two incidents, but everything else is just wonderful!

I've watched this show a dozen times over. I speak Korean but I have also seen it with 3 different sets of English subtitles and this particular set has the best subs, I think. I even got my brother to watch it with me, and he has difficulty reading and usually will not watch ANYTHING with subtitles, and he still watched this entire show with me in about 3 days. Even he was totally hooked, and he's not a fan of Asian dramas or cinema at all.",1365292800,2,1724,4.501597444089457
