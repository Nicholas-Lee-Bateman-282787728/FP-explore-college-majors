8420379,5,B004AKNRSI,Been looking for this classic series for years.  It is great and the price was reasonable.  Thanks.,1496188800,,99,4.764705882352941
8420380,5,B004AKNRSI,This is my favorite TV series of all time. Among other things it makes fun of a purely mercenary attitude to higher education and medicine. I once wrote a fan letter to Andrew Davies who wrote a nice reply saying it is the only series he has done that is not an adaptation and for that reason he has a special affection for it.,1494720000,,327,4.125
8420381,5,B004AKNRSI,"Extremely funny and very surreal black comedy, set in a 60s campus university struggling as it enters the 80s with the changing focus on profit rather than education. Great characters, biting satire, some farce. Well written, and superbly acted. One of the BBC's best black comedies of all time.

This is a region 2 PAL DVD. You'll need a PAL compatible multi region DVD player (or suitable conversion software) to watch it in the USA.",1437696000,,435,4.8
8420382,5,B004AKNRSI,We enjoyed this mini-series back in the 80's. I'm sure this DVD will not disappoint.,1437264000,,84,4.666666666666667
8420383,5,B004AKNRSI,"I saw this show when living in the UK in the 1980s. It was brillant. A very dark comedy, and a tragic, prophetic drama about the medical and educational institutions in both Britain and America. In a strange way many of the extreme spoofs presented in this series have come to pass at a number of institutions.

If only the BBC would make it available in Region 1 format!",1336521600,6,371,4.3768115942028984
8420384,5,B004AKNRSI,"This is one of the best British shows I've ever seen, and I've been watching and waiting for it to come out on DVD in a format that is conducive to US players. I would buy this in a heartbeat, and watch it over and over, if only someone would release it in the US. From it's haunting theme song (""It's far away from anywhere you've ever been before... got to get your act together"") to it's wonderful cast - who doesn't love Peter Davison (Tristen from ""All Creatures Great and Small""), and he's met his match in Graham Crowden (Tom Ballard from ""Waiting For God""). The two of them work marvelously together as the head of a medical practice and the old-timer who believes that love will conquer all (even appendicitis!). I've pined for this show for so many years, I've lost track, and it just about broke my heart to have to trash the VHS tapes I had recorded off the PBS station when the show aired oh, so long ago (the tapes had become unwatchable with no audio left, all scratchy and skipping - a shame). So please, please, someone make my day (week, month, year, LIFE) and put together a set I can watch in my humble Upstate New York home.",1328832000,10,1145,4.330232558139535
8420385,4,B004AKNRSI,"I have 8 of Rodney Yee's viedos,I feel he does a wonderful job expressing his yoga practices and his explinations of the different poses.  He  emphasizes how important it is to allow your breath and body to connect as  one.  Some of the poses are difficult but with props and listening to your  inner body and breathing, they are all obtainable.  Patrica Walden too,  gives great instructions, the only problem I find is my own frustration  because I have so much tightness and am a lot less flexiable, then I remind  myself that I am only a beginner and that helps me continue my practices. I  think they are very inspirational!  Good luck! Namasta.",943833600,14,650,4.614035087719298
