8069452,4,B0009XAMNS,"Got this off the Mercs collection brought to you by Grindhouse Experience. I love B-grade action films and pretty much anything to do with the Vietnam War, but I honestly was not expecting much from this movie except a little popcorn fare. What I got was a fast-moving, gritty, cynical, tragic, and sometimes funny action film. Usually B-movies have pacing problems, but I am happy to report that this one held my interest the whole time. I found myself rooting for the good guys and developed a fondness for all four. There will be a few scenes in this film that will stick with me for a while. The ending was a real shocker, at least for me, and  added to the overall tone of the film. An underrated gem.",1494547200,,706,4.430769230769231
