3446534,5,B001ACI5B8,My daughter can't get enough of these videos!! We have all the sight words and she just loves them. And you want to talk about learning! When we read a story she picks out all the sight words!! Not a big TV person but this is worth it!!,1233619200,,236,3.9375
3446535,5,B001ACI5B8,"My daughter is 3 yrs old. She watched this video only once and was able to ""read"" words in other settings.  This is a great tool for a child that is ready to start sight reading.  She loves the video and asks to watch it all the time, she has started to read words from books that we haven't read together yet.  It is very exciting for both of us.  We also have Meet the Sight Words 1 & 3 - I would recommend getting all three videos.",1233619200,,434,3.897727272727273
3446536,5,B001ACI5B8,"This series of dvd's are great.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter doesn't watch much tv here at home but we do have a dvd player in our car.  I decided early on that I wouldn't just play movies with no educational value since she's so mesmorized by movies in general.  These dvd's are horribly boring to listen to but when there is nothing else to do in the car, she watches and listens to them...and in turn learns from them.  I highly recommend these dvd's, it's amazing how much young ones absorb.",1232841600,,494,4.279569892473118

This is a great supplement that helps the words stick. They do two interactive reviews at the end and also a very short review story featuring the site words. I will purchase site words 3.

3446591,4,B001ACI5B8,Since the kids liked this alot I decided to get the entire set.  Its very helpful for 1-2yr olds to get down the basic concepts.

3446596,5,B001ACI5B8,"My two year old loves learning. Between 14 and 18 months she picked up the alphabet and recognition, sounds, shapes, colors, and numbers 1-10 in english and spanish. She taught herself through tablet apps. It's a year later and i decided she may like sight words and learning to read. I rented the Meet the Sight words 1-3 and they were a hit. After 1 or 2 viewings each, she had learned them all. She knew some of them already, but because of this company's videos, she learned the rest with ease. After she proved she knew those, I rented the digraph video and again, it only took a few viewings for her to learn them. I love these videos and though I'm not sure I'll buy them physically since she caught on so fast, I'll definitely give as gifts or recommend to others I know. She's currently watching the blends video. It's longer than the other videos, so she loses interest towards the end and doesn't catch those blends. However, she's catching on quickly. I should add that all of the stuff I just said happened over a period of a week. They're awesome videos, I'm glad I ran across the 'sh' video on youtube. My daughter instantly loved it, which is what prompted our week of Sight Words and Phonics. I'm elated that she's pre-k/kindergarten ready at only 2.5! If you're still hesitant, go on youtube and let your little one watch the previews to determine if these are the right videos for them.",1397347200,,1405,4.4921875

3446598,5,B001ACI5B8,"I rated it so high because it engaged my child while teaching him, at times it drove me crazy, the first thing everyday he would say is can I do  my words, which is  not a bad problem to have.  Thanks Preschool Prep",1395100800,,215,3.953488372093023
3446599,3,B001ACI5B8,"I ordered this for my 5yr old grandson, he is using it but really doesn't care for it.  He preferes the Leap frog DVD I got for him.  I bought both at the same time, because I had no idea what either one was like.  So the next time I will choose a leap frog product.",1394668800,,266,3.7142857142857144

They have wonderful songs, and huge letter. My son picked up the words right away. He's 5 now, but has been fully reading since he was 4.",1391472000,,294,4.175438596491228
3446602,3,B001ACI5B8,"My child is in Kindergarten but needs a lot of repetition before she can retain memorized facts. I knew going in that the DVD was probably going to be a bit boring for her, especially since it seems like it's geared toward younger children, but I just wanted to pop it into the DVD in our car so she got extra practice while we weren't able to work on them together at home. I bought all three DVDs and the third set of books.

The DVDs are pretty boring -- to the point that she tunes it out before she's learned all the words because she's bored to tears. That being said, it has helped her remember some of the words better than if we were just working on them at home. Overall I'm glad I got them but I wish I had seen it a couple years ago when it would have held her attention longer. If your child has a hard time focusing their attention on the TV you might want to think twice about getting the DVDs.

The books are another story -- those are great. Based on other reviews I only got the third set that contains all the words from the three DVDs and I really do like them. Somehow every sentence is made from mostly sight words, which means it's great practice of all the words. I'm sure you're all familiar with Level 1 readers that have a few sight words sprinkled throughout the book with most of the words being longer, sound-out types that make it more difficult for a budding reader. Even the books aimed at being ""sight word"" helpers don't typically include very many sight words. These books actually have a lot of the words in them, in easy sentences, with engaging story lines. I actually like them better than Bob books. Totally worth the money.",1391472000,2,1665,4.282539682539682
3446603,5,B001ACI5B8,"I already rated this with ""Meet the Sight Words 3"".  I loved them.  My daughter was a very early reader, and I believe that this series helped kick start her.  It made reading fun and easy.  She's seven now and still loves to read.  Nancy Drew is currently her favorite.  She read early readers at four.",1391299200,,303,4.321428571428571
3446604,5,B001ACI5B8,"The whole series 1-3 we purchased together. We got these when our son was 3. Within a few short months he mastered all the site words. Just as the video says .. you will be surprised just how easy your little one can learn. He just turned 6 and doing well in figuring out how to sound out words on his own.
I must add that I just didn't plop him in front of the tv and said here you go and walk away. I got involved along with him. Made flash cards and a game out of it for him like when he would run from one end of the room to the other, he would call out the word I held up as he ran, jumped, or scootered by. It was so much fun.
We also bought the readers that go along with these and read one a day till he mastered these.

3446619,5,B001ACI5B8,I work with students with autism and they absolutely love these DVDs.  The format is very simple and predictable.  They all ask for them whenever they get the chance to watch them.,1361318400,,180,4.59375

3446621,5,B001ACI5B8,"No kidding, I've used all of the Preschool Prep Co. DVDs for our daughter.  She learned soooo fast and picked up so much from them.  They seem very simple, repetative, but that is the magic.  Kids are mesmerized!  We gave them all away as she grew older and then had our son!  We had to go and buy some more for him.  I highly recommend these videos for kids of all abilities.",1356739200,,376,4.152777777777778
3446622,5,B001ACI5B8,"Both my boys have loved this movie! All the Preschool Prep productions are quality animation and educational and this is no exception.  It's age appropriate for both my sons (age 19 months, he can recognize and say most of the words) and my 4 year old (he knows them but is starting to learn to read so this movie is a good refresher).",1356739200,,335,4.317460317460317

3446625,5,B001ACI5B8,"My son is 2yrs and 3mo old.  He knows all the letter names, and sounds.  He was demanding more.  He wants to read, but some words you just can't sound out.  After 2 time he was saying several of the words before the movie.  The pictures don't match the words, because you can't make a picture of ""my"".
I find it boring, but he loves it.  Older children would likely find it boring too. We checked it out at the library first too see if he would like it.",1332720000,,453,4.033707865168539
3446626,5,B001ACI5B8,all the sight word videos are must haves my kidos love the video and have learned all the sightwords from all of their videos and we even got the coloring books to help us along. great to learn the sight words that help early reading.,1326240000,,234,4.222222222222222
3446627,5,B001ACI5B8,"I was looking for something educational for my 3 year old daughter that she can both learn and enjoy at the same time and this has worked perfectly. She loves and watches it 3-4 times a day. I rather her watch this than other cartoons, unlike other cartoons she will learn words which will eventually increase her vocabulary and at the long run make her a better reader. Therefore, I would like to thank the inventors for bring a great product to the market and I hope they continue making more DVD like this one.",1315267200,,513,4.410526315789474
3446628,5,B001ACI5B8,"These videos to the parent (and perhaps to some children) are extremely dull, repetitive and the graphics are not the best so if you are hoping for some bright shiny miracle on the screen to put your child in a learning trance this is not going to cut it. The good news is the video works and it seems to have lasting results. I haven't put these on consistantly and my son doesn't stay still to watch them for more than 10 minutes at a time. I put them on sometimes while he is playing and he stops to look and pays attention and goes back to playing. We haven't used these videos in several weeks but this morning he was very proud he used the word was and spelled it out to me--which for me which is a testimony to its usefulness and staying power. I don't think this is a stand alone product--you still needs flash cards or other hands on teaching to turn what is memorization into learning. The animations and words don't seem to correspond, and my son has gotten side tracked as to why a letter is doing the laundry and so on so I wish it would be a little more on target but overall this product without forceful or calculated use has indeed helped build my childs ability to recognize several words. We have skipped around cds which is not the intent so its hard to know how many he knows but definitely more than 8 words he can visually recognize and spell to me from the back of the car after casual use. (My son is 3.25) I wish that the videos included a simple list of what words they taught because I had to sit down and write a list so we could work on the words in other ways. (writing them at color time, choosing three words and doing flashcards, putting one of the flashcards on the fridge)",1302652800,,1708,4.210365853658536

3446630,5,B001ACI5B8,"Great tool to help your child learn to read.  Just a fun way to practice sight words - good change from flash cards.  My sons laugh and really enjoy these - while learning.  We have Meet the Sight Words 1,2, and 3.  Love them all.",1292716800,,230,4.044444444444444
3446631,5,B001ACI5B8,"I would recommend this to anyone wanting a beginning reading curriculum.  I checked this series out from our local library and within two or three times of watching it my 2 and a half year old daughter was reading these sight words in stories and books and on household product packaging.  I was sooooo excited!

The videos are very catchy showing each word in an eye-catching animation with music in the background.  The speaker repeats the word throughout the animation and then later in the video they quiz you on the word with no animation/music then add it in.  Also at the end they recap the sight words using animations that show the words in more realistic settings where your child would most likely read them, for example, for the sight word PLAY it would highlight it on a video game machine that says ""press PLAY.""

I let her watch it either once or sometimes twice a day (rather than brainless cartoons on TV).  She loves it.  I also combine this with those beginning reader sets.  We like the BOB books and also check them out from the library.  The other great tool I liked was the Leap Frog videos of the Lettery Factory (where she learned the sounds the letters make) and Talking Words Factory (which teaches beginning phonics and how to put letters together to make simple words).  We alternate with these educational videos whenever she wants to watch TV.

I am going to purchase this set for my friend's son.  I would highly recommend it.",1290643200,,1458,4.604651162790698
3446632,5,B001ACI5B8,I bought Meet the Sight Words 1 and thought that it was well done. I then purchased Meet the Sight Words 2 and felt the same way. My son and I loved them so much that we brought them into his first grade class. The teacher played the DVD for 1st grade and kindergarten during literacy hour and both classes loved them. These videos are not very long  and portray a fun way to keep childrens attention while learning their sight words. I just bought Meet the Sight Words 3 and WordWorld My Fuzzy Valentine and I'm hoping that they will be just as enjoyable for my son and his class.,1264982400,,581,4.2342342342342345
3446633,5,B001ACI5B8,"My 3 1/2 year old son LOVES these videos and is learning the sight words very quickly.  To my eyes, they seem boring - to his, very engaging.  He chooses these over many other videos frequently.  I would highly recommend!",1258502400,,221,4.475
3446634,5,B001ACI5B8,"I bought this dvd, along with 1 and 3, for my pre-schooler.  I thought it was boring but she loved it! she has learned all the sight words and it has really helped her learn.

My daughter can now read about 20 common words without any drilling, flash cards, etc.  Definitely worth the money.  I found the animation high quality and cute, so the kids like it but it is not irritating to parents.",1249776000,,348,4.476190476190476
3446637,5,B001ACI5B8,"This movie is awesome!  Buy it!  You will make learning sight words fun, quick, and easy when doing so is rarely the case.  It calls children's attention to the letters and ""shape"" of the word through anamation so that they remember what the word looks like in order to memorize it.  It's an ideal memorization tool.  (Sight words cannot be sounded out.)  And, the list includes both the Dolch (older list) and Fry (more updated) high-frequency words.  I am a former first grade teacher and I have my masters as a Reading Specialist.  (I currently stay home with my children.) After watching the movie 2-3 times, my 4 year old could read every word instantly.  While you teach sight words, continue to practice phonics and sounding out simple 2-3 letter words with short vowel sounds so your child learns decoding skills, too.",1242259200,7,826,4.76056338028169

8276605,5,B001ACI5B8,I love Preschool Prep Company! My son is 3 years old and has been watching these videos since he was 1. He's been reading since he was one so I thought I should introduce sight words just to make sure he knows them and he learned them within a week. You have to be consistent because the videos teach by repeating the words and it's sort of addictive. This company is the best. I'm going to order the Math series next so he can start on it. There is nothing that I don't like about the video.,1524268800,,492,4.082474226804123
