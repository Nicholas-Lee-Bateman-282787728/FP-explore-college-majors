Neither one of them does anything and they go on vacations to St. Tropez, Aspen, Miami, they shop at Roberto Cavalli, Versace, Christian Dior, they live on Park Avenue in Manhattan in a Penthouse apartment!!! They are so rich and sexy and gorgeous. I love the Gastineaus!",1138838400,4,315,4.851851851851852
2453540,4,B000C65ZAM,"You will definetly not come out from watching this DVD any smarter, thats for sure, but The Gastineau Girls is definetly a guilty pleasure of America.  Being able to see how these filthy rich socialites really live their day to day lives is entertaining, hell that is why the show was re-newed for a second season.  If your looking for education television, then you are lost, but if your looking for a good show thats actually enjoyable, your found.",1138838400,3,450,4.6835443037974684
2453541,1,B000C65ZAM,"Watching this trainwreck for free on television is very different from actually expecting people to pay for it.  On television, at first, the main reason to watch was to answer the question, ""Are these two for real?"" .

But after a few episodes it was pretty clear that, yes, Lisa and Brittney (especially Lisa, the mother) really are as shallow and self-centered and lazy as it seems--with a tremendous sense of self-importance and entitlement.  Why do they feel the world should revolve around them?  Will people really pay to see them shop, be rude to each other (and those around them), and try to be the center of attention in all circumstances?

When Lisa was recently asked on 20/20 what ""The Gastineau Girls"" was about, she answered, ""Nothing.""  That sums it up pretty well.",1138838400,12,782,4.798507462686567
2453542,5,B000C65ZAM,"Everybody likes to look into the lives of the filty rich, which is why shows like Laguna Beach & The O.C. are so popular, but when it comes to filthy rich nobody lives quite like Lisa & Brittny Gastineau, a mother / daughter socialite duo from the ultra exclusive, ultra expensive Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York. Lisa is the ex-wife of NFL legend Mark Gastineau, and has since enjoyed excellent investments in high class retail establishments such as Christian Dior & DKNY.

On this show, the spoiled duo spend more money than most people can even imagine seeing. E! excellently documents their plush lifestyle, keeping the reality in reality television. The girls travel to Miami, Aspen, L.A. and such simply to party and shop. The show covers their red-carpet walk at the Oscars and also Brittny's first runway model gig, for high end designers Anne Bowen and Ed Hardy.

The show was histarical and made the viewer envious, but at the same time it shows the desirable bond of a mother and daughter, and their struggles with age (Lisa) and finding love (Brittny & Lisa). They are absolutely gorgeous, funny and witty. The show's special features are also worth viewing. Don't pass this up.",1138752000,4,1198,4.810679611650485
2453543,5,B000C65ZAM,"The ONLY reason I am buying this DVD is to once again see and hear LOU THE DOORMAN,host and narrator of the show tell it like it is. His wit and charm are SORELY missing from this seasons episodes currenttly airing on E! lou really was the glue to the show,keeping it moving,breaking up the monatany with his ongoing clever quips. Tryed watching this years premeire episode and I am happy to say I won't be returning. Any body know what the actor is up to now? Heard he moved up quite a few notches on the food chain to a part on the upcoming SOPRANOS. Good for Lou. Really looking forward to seeing him on the tube again. He is sorely missed.",1138492800,4,643,4.235772357723577

Its funny how some rich people live",1382918400,,110,4.0
8095952,5,B000C65ZAM,"If you enjoy reality tv, especially those of the rich then this another one worth adding tp your collection! Gotta have it!",1357257600,,123,4.636363636363637
8095953,5,B000C65ZAM,"I remember watching this show when it premiered on E! a few yrs ago. I really don't understand why it was cancelled. The show was great very entertaining. Lisa and Brittny are real not acting like other ""reality shows"" out there. Like those kardashians for example I saw season one and stopped after that because the show looked 100% staged and fake. Please bring back the Gastineau Girls I miss the show and it was so much fun to watch!",1284249600,4,437,4.475
8095954,5,B000C65ZAM,"This show is no worse than say The Kardashians or Housewives of Orange County/New York.  Yes the Gastineaus are stupid, spoiled airheads, but that's what makes it fun to watch.  I say enjoy it for what it is, trashy good fun.",1264032000,,225,4.463414634146342
8095955,5,B000C65ZAM,"I've read all the negative reviews about this mother-daugther duo, and I have to agree that while they are not rocket scientists or intellectually stimulating, they ARE New York socialites, and for that, they are just fun to watch! The show is not for anyone looking for anything but, it's just sheer escapism from the doldrums of everyday life.

I love looking at the fashion and the excitement of Manhattan, and I have to say I love Lisa (the mom) she looks great for her age(though likely due to a lot of surgery!) and has a special energy that somehow makes her uplifting to me. The daughter Britney is pretty, but she's a little boring to me~~~but that's just my opinion. I'd say buy this if you are into fashion and Manhattan upscale life, or like looking at how the ""other half"" lives, other than that, don't bother, it ain't no social experiment, it's a socialite experiment!

I'm guessing sales of this DVD weren't so great, or they'd have also released the second season on DVD. That would've been fun too.",1217808000,3,1016,4.607734806629834
8095956,5,B000C65ZAM,"I really like this DVD, but I keep getting confused.  Which one is the daughter?  They both look so young and beautiful.  Or, wait a minute!  Are they actually 18-year-old twins?  I'm confused!",1214265600,,193,4.7272727272727275

Just watching her turns me on more than flipping thru the pages of a Victoria's Secret catalogue.",1208736000,,460,7.381818181818182
8095958,1,B000C65ZAM,"This has got to be the most boring, unecessary show that was ever on! The mom needs to act her age and stop getting plastic surgery. The daughter, no personality and a brat! How did they get their money again... an old retired football player form way back when? What is so interesting in that! SAVE YOUR MONEY! This show is NOT GOOD!!!",1203638400,2,336,4.349206349206349
8095959,5,B000C65ZAM,I gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift.  It was so fun to watch our favorite episodes together and repeat the memorable dialogue!,1200614400,,137,4.48
