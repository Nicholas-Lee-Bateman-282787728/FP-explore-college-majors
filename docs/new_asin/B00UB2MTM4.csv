8705106,5,B00UB2MTM4,"I'm really not sure what prompted me to buy this set. I guess it was wanting to re-live simpler times. I remember watching these cartoons along with Krazy Kat and Snuffy Smith on Saturday afternoons on channel 5 in Chicago. While I haven't been able to watch the entire set yet, most of the episodes I have watched are of surprisingly nice quality. I already have the Krazy Kat collection which came out on dvd several years ago and now it leaves me hoping that the Snuffy Smith cartoons get released as well so I can complete my collection.",1464739200,,541,4.474747474747475

8705109,5,B00UB2MTM4,"A great collection for Beetle Bailey enthusiast, cartoons from the late 60s, memory lane, or animation enthusiast alike, this collectors series is worth it. Comes with lots of goodies, extras. As one reviewer listed pretty much all the extras, again its well worth it to purchase this 65th Anniversary Collectors Edition of Beetle Bailey DVD box set, at the time paid $17.99, a great deal for all the extras. When you open the dvd collection box set, inside there is another nice box (with all the extras/goodies), the box can be used for many things, to hold all your pens and pencils, stamps and checkbooks, etc. etc. It even has a small magnet latch to secure what ever contents you have inside.",1455235200,,698,4.729508196721311
