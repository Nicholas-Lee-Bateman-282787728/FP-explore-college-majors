I was  totally unprepaired for this movie the first time I had seen it. So many  elements of starkness,very bleak, fantasy with so much style. The acting  even seemed to be in a dream state that matched the movies flow. I loved  this movie, very rare with todays standards. Sublime.",927417600,3,488,4.6395348837209305
414612,5,6301973232,"Even after the never ending parade of so called masterpieces trotted out over the intervening forty plus years, ""The Night of The Hunter"" remains unassailable.  I first saw this film as an adolescent, and it  remains my favorite film to date.  The stark, arresting image of Shelley  Winters tied to the front seat of the Model T, her hair dancing slowly to  the silent rhythm of the rivers current, is haunting to this day.  Although  Mitchum went on to do great work, in my opinion he never eclipsed his role  as the cold-blooded country preacher, toting a switchblade.  He was  perfectly frightening.  ""The Night of the Hunter"" is proof  positive that the legions of special effects artists overpopulating  Hollywood today will never substitute for a great screenplay in the hands  of the right people.  With the current trend of reviving Hollywood classics  for limited big screen release, I am hopeful that one day I will have the  opportunity to see this film in a theatre.

414720,5,6301973232,"I don't hand out full five star ratings that often but this movie demands it for one easy reason. I really can't think of anything bad about the movie, and it lacks nothing. This movie truly is a thriller and is suspense throughout. But what is truly memorable about this film is that contains some of best cinematography of any film any genre. The use of shadow and light speaks more to the view than any of the actors, including great performances by Mitchum of course and also an aged but perfectly cast Gish. But the scene of a certain murdered character (no spoilers) on the bottom of the lake is truly haunting and unforgettable. The hair waiving in the underwater is amazing.  Likewise another scene which pits Mitchum versus Gish one night with each singing their own forms of good and evil. The singing and shadows again are amazing. When Mitchum is traveling along the river and roads the use of darkness and profile silhouettes is again striking. Also, normally, especially in older movies the use of children is often annoying to me or downright cheesy. But here, the kids are clearly messed up from the situation and their acting superb. That they are the target of such evil and chase is scary in ways modern films rarely ever touch. This film is one EVERYone should watch.",1502409600,,1287,4.644736842105263

414724,5,6301973232,"This is my favorite movie. I found it first on TMC. The black and white photography, the beauty and depth of Robert Mitchum's singing voice and the lyric river the two children float down on a skiff  to escape him as he hunts them through the night.. It is a really visual and beautiful film.  Shelly Winters was never more beautiful than when photographed as dead and sitting in an old car submerged in the river, her hair floating outward with the river weed. It also contrasts the crazy evil of Mitchum, dressed up as a Preacher with the innocence of the children. Lilian Gish is the good woman who finds them and protects them from him, literally with a shotgun. My favorite part is when he pops up after a night of suspense in the house and she shoots him. He runs, hopping and yelping in pain into the barn. Very satisfying moment. Great acting and quietness in this movie.",1496102400,3,879,4.453416149068323

414760,4,6301973232,"The great actor Charles Laughton's sole foray into directing is a mixed bag.  The dialog is stilted, although not out of line with other films of the time, and a few scenes strain credulity.  Pearl's doll may be an early example of a MacGuffin, although we don't know until well into the film what its significance is.  A few scenes, such as the children floating down the river at night, and especially the view of Shelley Winters underwater, are renowned, and for good reason.

The film's theme is the failure of the adult world to properly care for children.  The father manages to steal enough money to set his kids up for life, but he won't be around to make sure they will still have it when they need it.  The mother can't be trusted with the secret, and at the moment when the children need Uncle Birdie the most, he's drunk and passed out.  There's also the theme of how religion can be used for both good and ill, exemplified by Mitchum's violent, phony preacher character, contrasted with the Lillian Gish character who has devoted her life to protecting and caring for orphans.

Several scenes may have influenced other films.  Mitchum's ""love"" and ""hate"" tattoed on his knuckles are essential to his act where love triumphs over hate; this is repeated almost word for word in Spike Lee's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Do-the-Right-Thing/dp/B002H060L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Do the Right Thing</a>, when Bill Nunn as ""Radio Raheem"" explains the significance of his ""Love"" and ""Hate"" brass knuckles.  And Lillian Gish's line about how the children ""abide"" must have inspired Jeff Bridges' line in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski/dp/B00181JGI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski</a>&nbsp;of ""the Dude abides.""  It's an unusual word that doesn't come up often, and in other scenes, there's a running theme in that film of ""The Dude"" repeating memorable phrases he's heard, such as President Bush's comment on Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, ""this aggression will not stand,"" so it's not out of character.

Enjoyable if somewhat predictable, ""The Night of the Hunter"" is one of the minor classics of cinema.",1484524800,,2238,5.511695906432749

414814,5,6301973232,"This movie is so, so scary. I hadn't seen it for years and it is amazingly effective at illustrating its central theme: that a wolf in sheep's clothing is the greatest threat to the innocent (in this case, children). The scenery is mesmerizing and magical, and you can feel the silent film influences on setting and effects. Don't watch it alone at night!!!",1470700800,2,357,4.682539682539683
414855,5,6301973232,"Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a psychopath posing as a preacher, is released from prison and terrorizes two children (Billy Chapin, Sally Jane Bruce) in the hope of finding out where their father (Peter Graves), another criminal hanged for murder, has stashed $10K in used banknotes.

That is the basic plot of Charles Laughton's quite brilliant thriller, a combination of brilliant photography, memorable images and superlative performances that endures in viewers' minds. The film demands repeated viewings in order to appreciate its subtleties.

Set during the Great Depression, the film conjures up the repressed world of a small town miles from anywhere, where the center of activity is the local ice cream parlor run by Mr. and Mrs. Spoon (Evelyn Varden, Don Beddoe). With little or nothing else to disrupt the monotony of their lives, Harry's intrusion into their lives represents a welcome diversion, especially when he appears so pious in his sentiments. This is a world where Christianity is taken to extremes; the children's mother Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) willingly submits to numerous indignities in the belief that she will be ""saved"" as a result. We, the audience, know Harry's true purpose, but he is such a convincing dissembler that he has all the citizens held in his Tartuffe-like grasp.

When his true motives are exposed, the citizens turn on him like a lynch-mob; it is something of a relief to him that he will be hanged in private, without the mob's attentions. Laughton shows the consequences of religious extremism; it can not only be manipulated for self-interested purposes but it can turn supposedly godly citizens into animals baying for revenge, the kind of thing that the Bible does not teach.

While much of the action is filmed in location, Laughton includes numerous sequences which make great play of light and darkness; in one of them, the screen fades to black, except for a circle of light illuminating John's petrified face as he escapes once more from Harry's clutches. In another, set at night, the sight of Harry astride a horse resembles a Karagoz, or Turkish shadow-puppet walking slowly across an otherwise all-white horizon. We are not only reminded of his capacity for evil, but understand how universal that evil actually is, transcending time and space.

Stanley Cortez's cinematography contains some memorable images - of the animals in the trees at night, of a rabbit eating happily, oblivious to the impending danger of attack by an owl, and the sight of birds perched on tree-branches watching the children rowing down the river in their father's skiff. The children might be at risk, but their plight is symptomatic of the natural order of things where the weak are always victims of the strong.

In the end John and Pearl are redeemed - not through their own efforts, but through the intervention of a kindly old lady Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). She understands what religion actually represents; it is not just comprised of empty words, but true belief in God and ultimate salvation. The contrast between her view and that of Harry is emphasized in another memorable sequence where both of them sing the same song - with one important difference. Harry never mentions the name of Jesus.

The film ends at Christmastime with the children giving Miss Cooper a present, and Miss Cooper addressing viewers direct to camera in close-up about the importance of childhood as a time of innocence and wonder. In a fallen world dominated by exploiters like Harry, such simple traits are largely forgotten.

James Agee's script is brilliant, with an acute ear for local expressions. Mitchum has never been more sinister, or more powerful, while Gish exhibits the moral (if not the physical) strength to resist him. A truly memorable, if enduringly horrifying experience.",1469923200,,3826,5.090909090909091

414864,4,6301973232,"As I watched this I frequently thought of the Universal Frankenstein films of the '30's. Given Laughton's connection to those films, his wife was the Bride of Frankenstein, after all, surely this was intentional. Kinda surprised no one (that I know of) has made this connection.

Some of the visual nods to those films:

The stark, expressionistic shadows and angles of the photography. For example, the kid's house at night at times reminded me of the stark, expressionistic look of the castle in Son of Frankenstein.

Mitchum's odd reaching for the heavens in the bedroom, which had a kinda unusual angled ceiling, just before murdering Shelley Winters, was like the monster's reach for the light in the ceiling in the first film.

Mitchum chasing the children up the basement steps with his arms outstretched look exactly like the Frankenstein monster would, if he were to ever chase children. Even the jacket arms looked to short when his arms were outstretched.

Mitchum's odd scream and awkward run to the barn after being shot; it looks and sounds like Karloff's monster running from the hunters at the end of the hermit scene in Bride of Frankenstein.

And then there's the completely iconic Universal horror film cliche of the angry mob near the end of the film, complete with torches!!

Finally, there's Lilian Gish's over-the-top, teary-eyed religious recitations at the very end, which reminded me of the over-the-top, teary-eyed schmaltz of the above mentioned hermit scene from Bride.

I just can't believe that these connections were not intentional.",1465689600,,1565,5.109803921568627

414927,4,6301973232,"Totally atmospheric, quite surrealist and full of symbolism, this film directed by Charles Laughton at times far more closely resembles a stage setting rather than any attempt at a realistic depiction of events.
More of a fairytale really, complete with all the stock characters.
Under influence what what must have been German Expressionism, the scenery is at times reduced to angular ""flats"" and backgrounds become silhouettes against an obvious cyclarama within a sound-stage.
Allegory is much in evidence and biblical quotations frequent, as Robert Mitchum, decked out in the typical black of the western ""baddie"" comes to town ostensibly as a ""fire-&-brimstone"" preacher, but really as a psychopathic, misogynistic murderer seeking stolen loot he learned of from a fellow inmate in prison who was hanged for his crimes. He's also a most accomplished liar and could even be seen to represent Lucifer himself.

Early in the film Mitchum's character sits watching a burlesque show with a stripper, and plays with his ever present flick knife, which ""erects"" at the key moment, as does his showing of the H-A-T-E tattoo on his left hand. He hates/fears women? But has apparently already murdered more than a few for financial gain.
He knows of the money, but not where it's hidden, ...this being the driving storyline in most of the movie.
Shelley Winters is the widow of the executed man and she has two young children, both of whom are party to the whereabouts of the proceeds of the robbery, and sworn to absolute secrecy by their real Dad.
Winters is now a vulnerable, unfulfilled but simple woman, easily led by the all-pervasive religion that holds the small town so tightly in its grip.
Mitchum enters as temptation and easily courts and weds her, thus becoming the kids stepfather in the hope gaining the children's secret.
He marries Winters, but refuses to consummate the wedding at all, women being the source of all evil and the sexual act only for procreation....or so he says. Remember he hates women....
Winters of course suddenly gets ""the ole-style religion"" (like you do!) and joins him in his full gospel experience preaching shows.
(Some VERY bad acting from Winters ensues in this bit!)

Mitchum plays ""menace"" for all it's worth here, complete with his casting his dark shadow over the house and the kids on several occasions.
First he tries to charm them, but later become more violent in his methods.

Laughton considered casting Gary Cooper as the Preacher, who wouldn't accept the role as being possibly detrimental to his career.
However Robert Mitchum was eager for the part.
Laughton was apparently particularly impressed at Mitchum's audition. When the character was decribed as ""a diabolical sh-t."" Mitchum promptly answered, ""Present!""

The movie sets up this scenario and explores it for the first half, but after the Preacher's violent attack on their mother, the children make their escape alone and in a boat. They drift downriver, ...again obviously a studio tank, accompanied by shots of various wildlife. This sequence becomes quite over-long and really heralds a change in the movie narrative. It suddenly becomes much more ""religious"" in tone, when eventually the kids are found by a lone women who takes in stray kids as some sort of duty to give her life purpose and please god.
However she's not above physically spanking the naked older boy while bathing him!

There's some quite bizarre happenings from here on in, and I thought the ending with it's biblical texts and homilies spoken directly to camera was the weakest part of the whole movie.
Mitchum turns out to be a whimpering coward, and he's dispatched and then captured quite easily.
Having set him up as such a strong evil menace, his final apprehension seems highly unlikely, and he runs away to hide in a barn repeatedly uttering some of the weirdest ""screams"" I've ever heard from any man in a movie. Quite strange really!
Then he just remains there until the cops arrive? Why doesn't he escape in the lengthy time it takes for the troopers to get there? He has a horse ready!

Then there's the truly strange re-appearance of those previously highly religious god-fearin' townfolks, now all part of a rabid lynch mob complete with burning brands, axes and smashed up furniture looted from a nearby store!

To watch this movie you have to abandon all expectations of ""reality"". It's a staged allegory on the two sides of religion.
The terrible things that are so often done in its name, ...and the supposed help, comfort and charity it can engender.
The fairytale of the wolf in sheep's clothing, ...and the genuine meek sheep if you like.
Probably not as powerful as the work of Ingmar Bergman, but very much in that mode.

Enjoyable for me, ....but only up until the ending which comes across as being glib, very much lacking in subtlety, and far too heavy in its message/moral preaching for today's audience, ...or even that of 1955 I expect.
It just felt like it should have been carefully embroidered in some young girl's very best cross-stitch on one of those faded old pioneer wall samplers with those saccharine homilies.",1454284800,,5137,4.951276102088167

They decided (who knows why ?) to letterbox the movie, thus to me, destroying it.
I have never seen anything that would make me think it was suppose to be letterboxed (there is the one shot where a top of a set is seen, but this doesn't outweigh the beautiful compositions that are destroyed when the film is letterboxed, it doesn't look better letterboxed). I have seen it in the theaters several times on film, never letterboxed. They haven't ""restored"" it, they ruined it. This is the version to watch until they come out with another upgrade.
For those doubter there is an article that was written back in the 80s I think in American Cinematographer that specifically says that this movie was shot in Standard Aspect and bucked the trend of widescreen movies. I do think that article was written with the participation of the original cinematographer.  I can't stand to watch the new version, it breaks my heart, just because something is new doesn't make it better.

415045,1,6301973232,"Oh, lord, where do I begin?  I just watched this film for the first time (on a recommendation by my sister).  I found it laughable at best.

Robert Mitchum plays (well, at least tries to) a crazy ""preacher"" who's after some money supposedly garnered in a robbery by one of his prison acquaintences.  He shows up in this guy's hometown, pulls one of the lamest grifts in history, and tries to find out ""where the money is.""  Obviously, Shelly Winters (who plays the dead man's widow) was hit over the head with a brick during the filming of her part.  Mitchum's performance was not scary, believable, or menacing.  In fact, it was laughable, as was most of the film.  You would think by putting two childrens' lives at risk, the movie would have been scary.  Perhaps if they would have cast children who could act, maybe they could have pulled some life out of this.  Unfortunately, one had a speech impediment and the other was as stiff as a board.

The script, or what they would have you believe was a script, didn't pass muster.  You've got Frankenstein, er, Mitchum chasing after the children (arms flailing madly), and he cannot get to them in the water before they make their escape.  If he would have stopped his flailing not only could he have caught them, he could have also had time for a swim!  And everyone knows that if you're traversing a river, anyone can keep up with you by simply riding a horse.  Yessir, you can drift for miles and miles and miles, but The Right Reverend is gonna' find you no matter what.

This movie was directed by Charles Laughton (very famous actor) and was his only attempt.  The film was originally savaged by critics AND moviegoers so badly, he never tried his luck at directing (or acting, either [I think]).

A woman warns children: beware of false prophets. Children playing see a body in a barn. A man in an open top car drives down a road. [A rear projection screen.] He attends a theater, but is caught for being a car thief. Elsewhere a man brings money to his son, the police are after him! Ben Harper will be hanged for a double murder. [This is set in the Great Depression of the 1930s.] Ben never talked. A prison guard looks after his family. His children are teased at school. We see a steam locomotive. A stranger is in town, he lives in the boarding house. Harry Powell tells a story about Hate and Love. He was a friend to Ben, he says. There is a picnic, Harry pumps Mrs. Harper for information. Powell tells John about the marriage. Will Pearl spill the beans? Harry talks to his wife about personal matters.

Pearl cuts up pieces of paper, she doesnt know what it is. Willow made a mistake in a hasty marriage to a stranger. Then we learn that Willow has run away with a traveling salesman! [Who will repot this to the police?] Powell has a good story for her disappearance. Will Uncle Bertie tell what he saw? Harry questions Pearl and John about that money. John says its in the cellar under a stone. But Pearl tells where it is! They run out of the house and go to Uncle Bertie. Hes no help. The children leave in a boat and paddle down river. They seek shelter in a cow barn for the night. [No dogs to warn against strangers?] Powell is on their trail. [Those backgrounds seel like a back lot.] They find a home with Miss Cooper. The Bible provides low-cost entertainment for her children. The Preacher finds Ruby and treats her to ice cream while he asks questions.

Ruby tells Miss Cooper about this. Powell shows up to ask about John and Pearl. He aint my Dad. A good woman with a gun stops a bad guy. Harry returns after dark and sings. A shot drives him off. Then Miss Cooper calls the police. Powell is arrested for the murder of Willow. John hits Harry with the doll, money falls out. There is a crowd yelling for punishment of this Bluebeard. The police take this man out the back way to prison. Miss Cooper and the children celebrate Christmas. Johns present is a watch.

Was this meant as a horror film? A warning against strangers who put on an act to impress the people they meet? This isn't much of a story, parts seem implausible except as needed for this story. Beware of friendly strangers who try to sell you something is still good advice. Just watch the advertising on TV for examples. Trust no one. Would people, then or now, be fooled by a stranger who said he was a preacher? Their own local preacher would quickly spot a phony [IMO].",1413417600,,2704,4.348514851485149

They both speak the language of the demanding, severe authority of God, though the message is the same, the motives are different... one is motivated by hate and greed and the other by love and devotion.

By today's standards, this movie might seem sort of tame, but that's the beauty of it.  Violence is implied, but often not seen.  The storyline of 'Hunter' is sadly too common in today's news; some of the plot points may not surprise the viewer.  However, there's an eerie quality to this picture that cannot be denied.  While I'm not certain of the effect 'Hunter' had on motion picture history, I can't help but feel it set the standard for certain thriller/horror pictures today.

Yet, my favorite part of the movie is the magic that is Robert Mitchum.  In many of his roles, he seems to be himself on the screen...effortless, indifferent, cool.  I was blown away at his performance in 'Hunter' b/c it's truly a Robert Mitchum I've never seen on screen.  It was like I was watching a whole new actor.  He is mesmerizing in this movie, no doubt about it.

Shelley Winter's marries Mitchum, and he ends up killing her and chasing the children to find the money that their father gave them (he robbed a bank and kills 2 people).  Mitchum is the father's cell mate.  Side characters like ""Icey Spoon"" -- are completely foolish and corrupt.

At first they would say they didn't want to see it because it was in black and white, but it got their attention every time.  The Night of the Hunter strikes some viewers as ""childish"" because it seems stiff and stylistic.  But that's part of the artistry.  The black and white is necessary to get the shadows hanging over the children's lives just right, to make the fog on the night of a murder especially creepy.  The occasional quaint language makes it clear that we are hearing a thriller fairy or morality tale.  The look of The Night of the Hunter reminds me of great illustrations in a story book, a little bit like black and white cutouts.

And the story is wonderful.  Children are saved from a murderous fortune hunter, who on the surface is a ""man of God,"" by a woman who simply does good for no earthly reward and without making a show of it:  ""Ye shall know them by their fruits.""  The difference between the nature of good and evil is clear when we see ""the hunter"" use weapons to kill, while the good woman hero uses a weapon to protect innocent children.  The hunter and the good woman sing a hymn together: He sings it to fool people into thinking he's good, while she sings it as a kind of prayer.  The moral of the story is obvious, but I'll leave that up to the viewer.  You'll feel good after you see this film.  It's a reminder that there is indeed evil.

415217,5,6301973232,"This is one of my favorite films and I never tire of watching it. It's a crime that Charles Laughton never directed another movie after its mediocre reception at the box office. It's easy to see why it disturbed many people in the 50s. Film noir was pretty threatening to some people anyway, and this is part noir and part fairy tale, with a large dose of German Expressionism.

The film closely follows the novel by Southern Gothic author Davis Grubb. Robert Mitchum is a phony Christian, the sociopathic preacher born a little too early to be a successful televangelist. Lillian Gish is the genuine Christian, honest and self-sacrificing. Shelley Winters, still young and pretty, is blindly swayed by Mitchum's charisma and scripture-quoting, as are most of the townspeople. The performances by the two child actors are pretty strong; even the usually stiff Peter Graves does a good job. The dream-like (or nightmarish) river sequence is particularly memorable.",1377216000,,963,5.094936708860759

415219,5,6301973232,"To anyone who has seen The Night of the Hunter - Charles Laughton's brilliant and terrifying, noirish, Gothic fairy tale - the sound of Robert Mitchum's deep, oily voice curling over the night will summon nightmares.

The Night of the Hunter is a great film for many reasons. But the lasting impression is the one made by Robert Mitchum. I was spellbound for every second that he was onscreen, riveted to his every word, and absolutely terrified, but unable to look away.
I'm a BIG fan of Mitchum. The man could act just as well as Gregory Peck or James Stewart, but the great thing was that he couldn't care less. He carried a brutal air of dismissance, like he didn't give a damn what anyone thought. But even as the menacing, terrifying, diabolical ""preacher""/serial killer Harry Powell his possesses a magnetic, irresistible charisma.

But his portrayal of Harry Powell ranks among cinema's all-time best. While not possessing the twisted psyche of Norman Bates, nor the charm and grace of Hannibal Lecter, Harry Powell trumps them all for sheer menace: physical, and mental. Think the unstoppable force of the Shark from Jaws, meets the charisma and magnetism of Napoleon from Animal Farm. Add to that Mitchum's 6'1 frame, the lazy eyes and unforgettable tattoos, and you have a villain that leaves a lasting impression.

Whenever Robert Mitchum/Harry Powell is on the screen, the film does brilliantly. You name a synonym for pure evil, terrifying, or brilliant, and you describe his performance: chilling, twisted, evil, menacing, disturbing, horrific, electrifying, psychopathic, unforgettable.

Charles Laughton's film has been called part Gothic, part Mark Twain, part allegory, part parable, and part horror, with heavy noir, Christian, expressionist, dream-like, and coming-of age overtones. But I think that at it's bottom, it is an allegory between good and evil. It isn't subtle about this. Keep an eye on Mitchum's hands (during the scenes where he seeks self-sympathy he subtly manoeuvres his ""LOVE"" hand forward, but in the menacing scenes his ""HATE"" hand is prominent). But it's message is effective.

The ONLY con in the film is the ending. After setting up some of the most terrifying, memorable scenes and characters in cinema history, The Night of the Hunter sinks into underwhelming sentimentality. Now, I get it, I get it. The film is an allegory, and you can't have evil without good. But Powell goes out with a ""phhut"", rather than the ""BANG"" he deserved, the Christmas scenes smell of cheesiness, and the Scripture quoting is out of place. But I love the film anyways!

Did I mention the imagery? The film is visually stunning. The shadows are deep and rich as anything Wilder or Hitchcock ever made, the flickering lights and dark cellars gloriously rendered in some of the finest black-and-white since Double Indemnity. There are haunting and powerful images and scenes that will stay in the mind long after they are gone: Harry Powell praying through a prison window with a switchblade between his hands, his air of enormous disgust at a vaudeville act, the silhouette of the Preacher on the wall, a corpse at the bottom of a lake - hair flowing beautifully in the current, the unforgettable shot of the Preacher riding across the plains crooning ""Leaning...leaning..."" (heavily ironic), and the iconic shot of the ""LOVE"" ""HATE"" knuckles on the railing.

In conclusion, The Night of the Hunter gets my highest possible rating! Criminally underrated, Charles Laughton's masterpiece (his only directorial effort) is boosted by stunning imagery, brilliant characters, and the menacing portrayal of serial killer Harry Powell by Robert Mitchum. If you have not already seen The Night of the Hunter, do so as soon as you can. The Criterion transfer is stunning crisp and clear, and the audio is fantastic.

415263,3,6301973232,"In 1932, the state of West Virginia hung an enterprising Dutch immigrant named Harry Powers.  His crime?  Luring two lonely widows and their innocent children into marriage and subsequently, death, all for the purpose of financial gain.  Per Wikipedia, Harry ""did not want to be an immigrant farmer like his father. He wanted a higher standard of living and planned to use the resources and opportunities available in America that were unavailable in his home country to gain money.""  Like any of us, Harry simply wanted to grab hold of the American dream.

In ""The Night of the Hunter,"" Powers becomes Harry Powell, an itinerant preacher whose silver-tongued rantings of thunder and brimstone attract adoration-- and lust-- in each new hamlet he graces.  Robert Mitchum channels Kirk Douglas at his most devious in portraying the charming psycopath.  Shelley Wintersm, reprising essentially the same character she would play in Kubrick's ""Lolita,"" is a widow of a certain age, so naive and vulnerable that Powell conquers her completely even as he treats her worse than a dog.

Much of the film's action follows Shelley's two young children, diffident John and the supremely annoying Pearl, as they flee from Powell.  Their race to reach a skiff and escape down the Ohio River is far more thrilling than any high-tech Bond/ Bourne chase ever could be.  The cinematography-- in particular, a prolonged underwater shot-- is ahead of its time.  Finally, 63 year-old silent-screen goddess Lillian Gish is still radiantly beautiful and projects immense power on screen.

For all of these reasons, I wish I could say I liked the film more.  The acting of the two child leads is wooden, a sin which is forgivable; but the fatally flawed script is not.  Apparently the book upon which this film is based delved deeper into aspects of Depression-era misery, like child prostitution, which are only hinted at here.  Perhaps due to the censorship of the 1950s Hollywood production code, what we get instead is an amalgam of horror, bluegrass, a happy Hollywood ending, and incomplete and unsatisfying characterizations.  As a viewer, I don't need to know everything about the characters' psychology, but characters at least need to be comprehensible and coherent; this coherence is completely lacking, especially in regard to Ruby.  The conflicted relationship between little Pearl and Powell, her savior and tormentor, could also have been explored in much greater detail.  A film that could have been about a lot of things just ends up being about a whole lot of nothing.

For a more honest look at childhood suffering, I would recommend the 1962 ""Ivan's Childhood"" or the 1946 ""Shoeshine.""  Hungering for evil?  Check out Kirk Douglas in ""Out of the Past"" or Orson Welles in just about anything.  Better yet, intersperse clips from these films with Nature Channel footage of raccoons and ducks. You might cut in scenes from ""Oh Brother Where art Thou"", as the film, unfortunately, is also something of a musical.  The end result will deliver the same experience as ""The Night of the Hunter,"" only, much, much better.

Maybe the tatooed words ""love"" on his right fingers and ""hate"" on the left ones remind him to display both emotions equally. But the only love that he possesses is for money.
He quotes Scripture but does not obey it, especially the warning that ""the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil."" That twisted love of getting money at any price, including murder, drives the movie. Shelley Winters as his wife, Lillian Gish as the kindly woman who has equal parts of common sense and compassion, and Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce as the children who are the prey of the psychopathic phony preacher are stunning. So is the cinematography. Whether it's an aerial shot zooming down on Mitchum, the surrealistic backgrounds during the children's flight down a river, or interior shots, the cameras set moods that sync with the actors' actions and dialogue.
Perhaps director Charles Laughton, whose acting career spanned stage performances in London and New York, the advent of cinema, and the golden age of Hollywood, sensed this would be his only shot at directing.

 Suffice to say this is no Cape Fear. There was no simmering menace in Mitchum's performance, he mostly just came off as silly and bumbling. The adult performances were mostly overwrought, even for the time and considering acting styles have changed over the years. The only thing this film has going for it is some really good cinematography in places, memorably Willa under the water.

My daughter wondered how many times one person could fall. I  wondered if the director was off to the side telling Mitchum to try to act like Frankenstein as he chased the children....seriously who really chases someone holding their arms out like that? They could rename this Night of the Bumbler and market it as a comedy- we were certainly laughing.

Now I know there may be people commenting on my review blasting me and claiming I don't get it, which is just one more puzzling thing about this movie. After watching it I decided to check and see if there were any negative reviews. Many of the one star reviewers were attacked with a viciousness I usually only see in political book reviews. I noticed that the five star reviewers were not attacked and told they were stupid and didn't get it. Why is this?
Maybe I don't get it. Perhaps the German expressionism is just over my head. But, like STD's, speeding tickets, lice, and MRSA, there are some things most people try not to get. :)",1346803200,11,1616,4.577854671280277

415316,4,6301973232,"I admit, truth admit,  that given a choice I much prefer Robert Mitchum  as guy who is not afraid to take a bullet of two, and gladly, from some dishy femme fatale like Jane Greer after she has led him over the hoops for a while in a film like Out Of The Past. Or as tough guy detective Phillip Marlowe not a afraid  to throw his weight around a little when the bad guys try to put the squeeze on some kindly old general in The Big Sleep (1980s version). What I can't figure, but maybe it is just a matter of taste, is him as a mad man good book preacher, who just off-handedly kills a slew of women (mainly with dough) for ""god."" But maybe too that is just because I get the slightest bit nervous around guys (gals too) who have a direct pipe line to ""him.""

And that dilemma pretty much tells the tale, or really the half tale, of the film under review, The Night Of The Hunter. See Preacher Man Powell, despite his apparent ""credentials"" is a stone-cold crazy out of the great American backwoods (1930s style) when a man could kill a few, okay, okay twenty something, women and not have a coast to coast manhunt bothering him. But Preacher Man, like all stone-cold crazies, can't leave well enough alone and so as he is fortuitously  bunked up in prison with a guy who is facing the hangman  for felony murder he finds out that the guy has the dough stashed somewhere back in the hills and hollows (yes, I know, hollas) of West Virginia.

Apparently they did not have a separate death row in those days because Brother Powell is in for some chicken charge and is released shortly after the execution. Released naturally to draw a beeline to Podunk . And there he courts the widow, faux coddles the kids, and then off-handedly cuts the widow's throat and dumps her in some convenient river. And then to the kids. But justice, very rough justice, is done in the end. End of story and time number two hundred and forty-two in film noir where we find out that crime does into pay.

I mentioned above that this was the half-tale. The other half woven into the stone-killer story is one about redemption, kind of. See the kids, knowing they are doomed if they do or don't tell Preacher Man where the dough is, head down river, and pronto. They wind up with Aunt Betty (okay, okay, Aunt Rachael), a women who takes in the strays of great depression 1930s). So as crazy and mad as Brother Powell is Sister Rachael is the opposite, including a having a ton of folk wisdom and country goodness. So you can see where an old tough guy crime noir aficionado would be longing to see Robert Mitchum show his stuff in a less stone-crazy manner. (Although maybe some dame, some unmentioned dame, put him over the edge back in the day. Then everything would be explainable.)",1339891200,,2759,4.385518590998043

The man talks to himself, has the words ""love"" and ""hate"" tattooed on his fingers, and is obsessed with ""vain women"" who lure men to sin with lust. It's Powell's ""mission"" then to destroy these women with his switchblade.

Powell is arrested in a stolen Model T while leaving the scene of his latest carnage.

(8.2) The Night of the Hunter (1955) - Robert Mitchum/Shelley Winters/Lillian Gish/James Gleason/Peter Graves/Billy Chapin (uncredited: John Hamilton/Michael Chapin)
.

CAST TRIVIA--

The only picture directed by Charles Laughton, who purportedly rewrote the entire James Agee script. This story was proved false in 2004, when Agee's first draft for the movie was discovered and found to be identical to the finished work.

Kids annoyed Laughton, so Robert Mitchum directed several scenes involving children.

Although widely considered a classic now, on first release, ""Hunter"" did poorly at the box office.

Billy Chapin (John Harper) is brother of Lauren (""Kitten"" on TV's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Knows-Best/dp/B0012Q3SZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Knows Best</a>""). Their brother Michael is uncredited here as Ruby's boyfriend.

Gary Cooper refused the role of Harry Powell, thinking it might ruin his career if he played the crazed holy man. Robert Mitchum lobbied for the part and got it.

Mitchum hated working with Shelley Winters.

Lillian Gish (Rachel Cooper) was cast because Laughton admired her work.

James Gleason (Birdie Steptoe), who played Lt. Rooney in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ARSENIC-AND-OLD-LACE/dp/B0045HCJHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ARSENIC AND OLD LACE</a>&nbsp;(1944) and was ""Gillis"" in the film version of ""The Life of Riley"" (1949), fought in the Spanish-American War of 1898.

John Hamilton (uncredited townsman who greets Rachel) had a long screen career but is best remembered by modern audiences as Perry White on TV's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Superman/dp/B000A5046K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Superman</a>.""",1327017600,2,2980,6.399002493765586

415323,3,6301973232,"Definitely a product of 1955.  I guess I've just been bred on too much realism in script and acting to be able to take this one very seriously.  It's like a play in the way they talk and act - everything is over-deliberate, as if the film-makers were afraid the audience couldn't handle any subtlety in a character.  Characters are over-simplified to the point of being totally unbeleivable or simutaneusly totally recognizable, i.e. fairly typical of the same kind of characters you'd find in lots of other film of that era.  Yes, I noticed lots of little foreshadowing scenes along the way, a supposed testament to the ""depth"" of this film, but everything else smacks so bad of 1950s Hollywood it doesn't seem to make much difference.

I liked the songs and the occasional surrealism of their river ride but mostly I found it a pretty tedious ride. The storyline is maudlin, cutesy, and fairly unsatisfying with or without the stilted acting.  Though the film has been called ""noir"" it didn't strike me as being noir in the way that I've come to understand the term - i.e. a movie that ends somewhat mid-sentence, leaving a lot of unresolved questions relating to the story reverberating with meaning through the place at which the film ends.  No, this film ties it up about as neatly as you could so ""noir"" in the sense of this film seems to indicate either ""dark subject matter"" or a film shot in black and white.  Guess I'll have to enlarge my definition of the term.  Whatever.  This is the 3rd Mitchum flick I've seen, and if nothing else I have at least discovered I'm not a huge fan. Sorry, this movie is just border-line silly.

415345,5,6301973232,"I got this film because it is admired as a classic from many different quarters, from Spike Lee to Scorsese.  To put it mildly, I was surprised once I finally watched it.  In black and white, the atmosphere is much like that of the Twilight Zone, with sharp angles and dark/bright contrasts.  WHile a horrible tale of kids facing down a sociopath who wants to kill them for money, the story is also kind of magical, even surrealistic at times, almost like the Outer Limits in its eeriness and other worldly quality.  In contrast to most film noires, it does not strive for criminal realism, seeing things instead from the children's point of view.  You get this right at the introduction, when Lillian Gish is reading a religious tale to a group of children.

Mitchum is an insane self-proclaimed preacher, ripping people off and murdering widows so that he can ""spread the word"" in a long private dialogue with God.  While in prison, he learns of a hidden stash of money, giving his life new purpose once he gets out.  This is the hunter coming out, moving relentlessly towards his goal by any means necessary.  He is one of the most frightening characters I have seen in cinema.

On the children's side, the boy who is guarding the money is the only person in town who understands what the preacher really is.  He escapes with his sister and they go on a boat ride that is like a hero's journey according to Joseph Campbell, entering a mystical world that will test him.  They are found downriver by a tough matron, the Gish character, and taken in.

But it still isn't safe, with Mitchum looking for them in all the towns along the way.  He finds them, of course, and eventually they escape in an unexpected way.  The boy faces down the devil, so to speak.  At the end, their salvation appears magical again, though the real world intrudes at times.  Strange conclusion.

Partly, that's because this movie is based on reality... and partly because it is based on Fairy Tale.  If you just look at the cover of the DVD you can get a sense of this movie.  Robert Mitchum, in shadow, showing one hand on which was tattooed the word ""Hate.""  Mitchum plays a dreamlike combination of a real world homicidal maniac, and the Wolf from Little Red Riding Hood.

Two little children stand between a monster and his goal.  To say more would be to give away too much of the plot.

The film uses elements of Expressionism, which makes it seem oddly modern since many of our contemporary directors draw from that well when making movies.  It was an unusual choice in 1955, though.

Seriously, with Halloween around the bend, you may be looking for good seasonal entertainment, and The Night of the Hunter delivers.",1287187200,4,1072,4.3686868686868685
415348,5,6301973232,"I first saw this movie on television when I was a child. I suspect that had I been in my parents care I would have never been allowed to watch it. My grandmother was a movie fan and had no objections to sharing the tv with me. Since then I have probably watched this movie at least 15 to 20 times and it still frightens me and leaves me in awe as this is one fantastic film that has a universal appeal in the sense that it brings out the most primal fears of most people.
The plot is fairly simple. A man(actor Peter Graves) robs a bank and is captured without the ill-gotten cash. He is sentenced to death and while awaiting execution he is jailed with the ultimate con man/grifter/presumably petty thief (actor Robert Mitchum). Mitchum tries to extract the whereabouts of Graves' booty to no avail. An obsessed Mitchum descends upon Graves' widow (Shelley Winters)and her two young children and passes himself off as an itinerant minister. Mitchum courts the widow and marries her. His abusive and evil side soon surfaces and he quickly rids himself of Winters because he is convinced the children hold the key to the location of the hidden fortune. The ensuing story involves a game of cat and mouse between Mitchum and the children who have run away from Mitchum to the open arms of an elderly woman (Lillian Gish) who takes in unwanted children.
On the face of it, the story is interesting and suspenseful. What elevates it to something far greater are the intense performances by the actors, the moody black and white photography which contrasts the elements of good vs evil, and artful direction by Charles Laughton in his sole attempt at film directing.
I highly recommend this film because of its uniqueness and its sensitivity which contrasts so starkly in comparison to Mitchum's evil protagonist.",1286236800,2,1808,4.7066246056782335

415350,5,6301973232,"I agree completely with Mr. Flanagan's rave review -- Night of the Hunter is a classic of imagery and mood -- but I think it is important to note that Agee intended the story to be deeply religious, and Charles Laughton directed it as a Bible story. The Biblical symbolism throughout -- the animals, the toad, the owl, the spider's web under which the skiff floats -- is the thematic armature of the story. It leads to the unforgettable moment when Harry Powell, outside the farm house, sings ""Leaning on the everlasting arms,"" and Lillian Gish in her rocking chair with her shotgun sings the song along with him. Good and Evil understand each other.

Almost every image in the movie is fake. Studio river, studio farmhouse, studio spider web, studio boat. There are no more than two or three exteriors. But this was obviously planned. This is not a realistic film, it is a myth, a story.

Powell is not really human, as we learn when he emits an animal growl at the top of the basement stairs when the children close the door on his fingers, and even more when the river's current conspires to sweep the children's skiff just out of his reach, and he emits a true animal roar of rage and frustration. This is why Lillian Gish tells the sheriff, ""I've got something trapped in my barn.""

My favorite moment has always been when Powell has Gish half-convinced he is the children's father, and John says, ""He ain't my father."" Gish now says, ""No, and he ain't no preacher neither."" Evil has its domain, but cannot fool the eyes of the truly good.

A flop in its time (albeit a naive era), a curiosity today, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is what Nietzsche called ""intempestive"" -- better, more elevated, for being out of its time.

A tribute to the value of the film is that so many reviewers here appreciate it profoundly.",1279670400,2,1811,4.542944785276074
415351,5,6301973232,"Freeze a film.  Remove a clip from that film.  Enlarge it.  Frame it.
Some films contain images that stand alone as art -- provoking a sense of wonder, evil, romance, adventure, etc.  Several classics come to mind:

Scarlet O'Hara standing at the train station surrounded by the dead and dying.
The monster's meeting his bride in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
Marilyn Monroe standing on the subway grating in THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH.
Charlie Chaplin's tramp riding the gears of the huge machine in MODERN TIMES.
Marion Crane meeting Mrs. Bates in the shower in PSYCHO.

Some more modern films also contain them as well:

The little Jewish girl in the red coat in SCHINDLER'S LIST.
The silent train ride of oil man and his ""adopted"" baby son in THERE WILL BE BLOOD.
A new species of bird in UP.
A slow motion inmate of SHUTTER ISLAND warning Teddy Daniels with a silent ""shhh.""
Friends holding hands preparing for certain demise by trash crusher in TOY STORY 3.

Images which inspire memory, discussion, emotion long after the film is over.  For a case of images that tell an amazing story, look no further than the strange classic THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.  I can think of no other film which evokes such hypnotic beauty and childlike wonder, sadness, and fear simply by its images.

Some examples:
Shelly Winters trapped in a deadly marriage and in an attic bedroom with the shadows sealing her in a light and darkness coffin.
The dark terrors of a childhood bedroom lit only by the streetlamp outside.
Spiders,lizards, and other creepy-crawlies made enormous by the forshortening of the movie camera as two children escape on their little boat.
""Chi-i-i-l-l-dren!"" as the deranged minister calls to the youngsters in the shadowy and evil cellar.
A beautiful girl toddler's mouth watering at the banquet laid before her which she cannot eat.
An old lady with a gun, singing and rocking, waiting, and waiting for evil to come to her house.
And the most effective of all?
A dead newly-wedded bride submerged in a car, strapped in, her throat slit into another gaping mouth while the currents play her hair into impossibly long strands.

I had to pause to wipe away goose bumps as I recalled that last one.

The sound of sirens tell us that the law is on his tail. He's going to be caught, but where can he hide the money that he stole for his wife and children? They know where, but the father swears them to secrecy. It will become the children's misfortune not only to have their father executed by hanging, but finding themselves pursued by a mysoginistic, psychopathic, preaching con artist who has shared a cell with the condemned man and learns about the stash. Upon his release he will do anything to get it, and the children will do anything they can do to survive. Their salvation might come in the form of a stern Rachel Cooper, an elderly lady, played by Lillian Gish, who takes in stray children, or will he kill her and them?

Originally panned by critics, this movie has generated a cult-like following and has been described as one of the top 100 films ever made. It is easy to see why. The acting talent is lead by Robert Mitchum who plays the murdering preacher, Harry Powell. He has an Elmer-Gantry-revival-tent personna. His smooth-talking spiritual hypnosis entrances the yokels, in particular, the wife of a storekeeper, Mrs. Icey Spoon, and the wife of the executed man played by Shelley Winters. Her son (Billy Chapin) knows what Powell is after, and decides to protect his younger sister as they journey on the Ohio River.

Scenes of a barn and house at twilight look like backgrounds on a stage or fake to the unimpressed. Yet, they add to the suspense and eerieness of the plot. Seeing a figure on horseback near dawn is haunting and even more nightmarish as his singing can be heard across a meadow. It is a voice soothing, beckoning and dangerous. It is evil coming for you, coming to do you harm. It is the hunter in the night.

This is the kind of movie that I miss. The kind I used to be able to find on the television during wintry Sunday afternoons, a movie that was a treat because of its suspense, the acting, and the plot. ""The Night of the Hunter"" is the kind of story that can take you back from incessant ""Dirty Dancing"" movies that make you feel like Ted Turner has it in for you, personally. This one will make you revel in movie-making history.

Robert Mitchum said the greatest performance he ever gave was as Harry Parker, and the best movie he ever made was this one. And he was so right.

The scene that still gives me goose flesh is the nighttime sequence when Parker, riding his horse slowly along the riverbank, is silhouetted in the moonlight, singing, ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."" The children, sleeping in a barn, are awakened by his song, and John says simply and helplessly, ""don't he never sleep?""

Parker is evil personified. And, John, the answer to your question is no. Evil never sleeps.

I'm no film snob, and don't know that much about behind-the-scenes stuff, but pay attention to the lighting and sets. Stanley Cortez' work is breathtaking, whether it's the scene of Shelley Winters in the river with her hair floating like the plant life, or the ""honeymoon"" scene - where the room and shadows are straight out of the wierd German stuff of the 1920's like Dr Caligari.

Some folks take their movies literally and might not like Night of the Hunter. It's a dream and a parable, meant to scare the bejeesus out of you. On that level, and many others, it works magnificently.

When I first saw this movie, it scared the hell out of me. And  it was the most terrifying movie I had ever seen. It still scares the hell out of me. And, half a century later, it's still the most terrifying movie I've seen. And, without question, a masterpiece.",1263340800,2,1465,4.547528517110266

Before I did, I read the reviews here on Amazon. There are a wide range of opinions; a lot of ""love and hate"" going on, so to speak. I ended up enjoying the film very much, more than I enjoyed Casablanca.

The most common criticism of this film seems to point to the ""bad acting."" To that, I say that there is a ""style"" of acting in Night of the Hunter that is consistent with the allegorical style of the film. If you don't enjoy the style of this film, that is perfectly reasonable and a matter of personal taste, but I think it's a mistake to blame it on ""bad acting.""

Given the style, the acting of all of the characters, including the children, is fine, and just as compelling as the fine cinematography and soundtrack. Each scene is an enchanting masterpiece unto itself, leaving a lasting impression. There are so many amazing scenes, too many to recount, such as the time that Mrs. Cooper (Lillian Gish) stands guard holding a gun and an owl swoops down on a young rabbit, and as the rabbit screams Gish says, ""It's a hard world for little things."" I know, it sounds hokey, but it's very powerful watching it. This film has been described as a thriller and a film noir, but while that may be true technically, it left me feeling inspired, joyful, and optimistic. The movie ""It's A Wonderful Life"" involves suicide, and yet it leaves you feeling inspired, joyful, and optimistic.

Those who think Night of the Hunter is a terrible movie feel that they should warn you to avoid it, or they say that those who think it's great are some kind of pseudo-intellectuals. But there is a good chance that you will love this film, and for that reason I recommend that you watch it. Now I want to read the book, which I understand is based on a true story and was a finalist for the 1955 National Book Awards. Don't let the bad reviews scare you away from this fine film: You may end up liking it as much as I and many others do, even if you aren't a ""pseudo-intellectual."" :-)",1261440000,2,2119,4.319095477386934

Criterion could certainly find much to add to the appreciation of Charles Laughton's only directed film -- maybe they could track down the children - Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce - and also ask Peter Graves to do commentary and a making of documentary---before it is too late.",1261353600,7,663,4.171875
415359,5,6301973232,"""Night of the Hunter"" is one of a minority of films where many good elements blend nearly perfectly. Set in West Virginia during the Depression, it is a coming of age story dealing with such issues as faith, childhood, and human nature. Robert Mitchum is excellent as a sociopathic and manipulative ""preacher"" targeting a widow and later her children to find money their late dad (portrayed by Peter Graves)hid after a robbery. The story contains memorable characters, effective mucical accompaniment (viewers may think differently of the hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" after watching the film), and often atmospheric cinematography. The film also effectively incorporates both very serious themes and a healthy dose of humor as well as suspense. The film climaxes after the fleeing children find refuge with a strong willed but very religious lady (not afraid to use a shotgun though) who takes care of orphans and abandoned children. Naturally, Mitchum's character eventually shows up for some very memorable scenes. Overall, ""Night of the Hunter"" is a very enjoyable classic film that I highly recommend.",1259107200,,1115,5.305084745762712
415360,5,6301973232,"My favorite film of 1955, one of my favorite films of the 50's and honestly, one of my favorite films ever made; `The Night of the Hunter' is an astonishing film that truly didn't get the love it deserved upon its release.  Thankfully it has reached `masterpiece' status today and is revered as one of the best thrillers ever filmed; a film that has really yet to be rivaled no matter how many have attempted to do just that.

Beautifully (and horrifically) meshing religious fanaticism, childish fairy-tales and good-old-fashioned horror techniques, `The Night of the Hunter' is one of those movies that feels organic in its completion; a film that really couldn't have been done any better.  Telling the chilling tale of a wayward preacher who happens to wind up sharing a jail cell with a bank-robbing death-row father.  This `preacher', Harry, is convinced that he can find the loot this man hid before getting arrested, and so he travels to this man's small town and woos his nave widow.  Stopping at nothing to unearth this money, Harry realizes that he may have to go as far as to slay some children to get his hands on it.

He has no problem with that.

Without the dedicated performances this film could have become clichd, forgettable and merely `good', but each and every actor gives this their all and elevates the film into something so much more than just `good'.

Robert Mitchum delivers one of the most chilling villains I've ever seen on film.  He has shown a level of comfort in this genre (watch him brew in `Cape Fear' as well) but this is his golden ticket so-to-speak.  With a booming voice that stirs emotions you didn't think you had (that `Leaning' song is just so gothic in its delivery) and a stance that overtakes you even through a television screen, this may very well be one of those iconic performances that history books were made for.  Both young ones (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) are capable, but of the two it is Chapin who steals the show.  His stunning portrait of betrayed adolescence is marvelously redered on screen with a bravado rarely seen in young performers.  Both Shelley Winters and Lillian Gish are just incredible in their supporting roles (not to mention the infectiously charming, and nosy, Evelyn Varden).  Gish really controls the films finale with her charm, wit and unbelievable understanding of her character's warm devotion.

But Winters...OMG!

In discussing this performance with friends it's easy to see why it is so astonishing.  There is a moment in the film where Winters character, Willa, is commanded to approach herself in the mirror and tell Harry what she sees.  There is an instant awareness of what Willa is understanding about herself and about her current situation.  She doesn't quite comprehend it, but she knows that it is there.  As her character develops over the next few scenes she completely evokes what the entirety of this film is all about, giving us a subtle yet profound look at a woman who is coming to terms with the fact that she (as one friend put it) `fears what she was fearing all the time but not confessing to herself'.

Like I said; OMG!

The film is expertly handled by director Charles Laughton (the flamboyant actor who made this film and apparently couldn't take the criticisms so he never made another film) and especially cinematographer Stanley Cortez, who just captures such a marvelously eerie mood reminiscent of a children's fairy tale gone very, very wrong.

It also highlights peoples gullibility to false preachers, but most of all it highlights the preciousness of children. It takes place in a time of hardship during the Great Depression.

The Night of the Hunter awakens a primal sense of evil and fear as no other film I know. Robert Mitchum embodies evil which is profound and petty, vicious and maudlin, prescient and idiotic, and always, always relentlessly bearing down on what we fear most..

This is sustained, inspired filmmaking of the highest order. Action and character unfold together, seamlessly. There is not one scene superfluous to the film as a whole, nothing you could or would do without.. And the counter to Mitchum's evil (Mrs. Cooper -  Lillian Gish) is afforded just the right weight..

415392,2,6301973232,"""The Night of the Hunter"" is so well-loved by many movie fans, so lionized by critics, and so influential to a large crop of modern filmmakers that I hesitate to give it a negative review. Nevertheless, I simply cannot recommend it.

There's a reason Charles Laughton made only one film: his quasi-expressionistic direction is extremely stilted. His actors are dreadfully hammy, particularly Robert Mitchum as the evil, scenery-chewing sociopath at the center of the plot and Shelley Winters as the blubbering, zombie-like woman he kills in a relentless quest for her late husband's bank loot. What little acting Winters does is not only cut short by Mitchum's knife but by overly rapid cutting from scene to scene. In contrast, overlong scenes in which her children float downriver to escape from the murderous preacher are intended to be artsy but struck me as dull and pretentious. And the archaic dialog that the actors spout is frequently beyond embarrassing.

I found the story lacked all suspense, which is the most damning thing I can say about what is purported to be a thriller. Nor is it scary in the least. For a character to be menacing, he must be unpredictable, but Mitchum's Harry Powell is so one-dimensional, telegraphing every move he makes, that I had to groan again and again. To care about characters in peril, they must seem real to you, yet none of them behave in believable ways. ""The Night of the Hunter"" is utterly unrealistic in its theatricality, and its risible religious hysteria plays like a parody. Its only redeeming features, to my mind, are the beautiful black-and-white cinematography and the lush musical score.

If you must see this hoary piece of over-the-top schlock, catch it on late-night TV or check it out from the library, but please watch before you buy. I very much doubt you'll want to experience Laughton's fever dream a second time. If you love Mitchum as a murderous bad guy, he does a star turn in the original ""Cape Fear,"" which is a far better, more suspenseful, and more frightening film. And if you want to buy a well-acted, well-directed film about a corrupt preacher, choose the classic ""Elmer Gantry"" with Oscar-winner Burt Lancaster in the title role.",1226448000,3,2212,4.909090909090909
415393,5,6301973232,"Lillian Gish opens this movie w/ a warning to beware of wolves in sheep's clothing. This sets the stage for the Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum from the equally classic Cape Fear), who roams the countryside searching for converts (aka: victims) to his special brand of fire-and-brimstone religion. This religion includes Powell's ""listening to the voice of God"", which will lead him to a town where he can prey upon the ignorant souls within. Enter Shelley Winters (Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, Poseiden Adventure) as the widow of an executed robber / killer (Peter Graves), who has hidden $10,000.00 somewhere on their property. Unfortunately, Powell shared a cell with dear hubby and tried without success to get him to reveal the location of the money. Now released, Powell sets out to find the place, marry the widow, and collect the fortune. Mitchum is supremely creepy as the reverend. He will make your skin crawl and your stomach flip! Set in a far more innocent / ignorant time, Powell is truly a wolf among sheep.

415406,5,6301973232,"NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is an excellent film. Set in depression era West Virginia it is based on an prize winning novel of the same name that was inspired by a real life murderer who lived in that area.  The surreal beginning and the fluffy ending in a cozy cottage at Christmas seem like the stuff of fairy tales but in between all is pure nightmare.

Robert Mitchum is both chilling and spellbinding as a criminal/preacher who marries the gullible widow of an executed cellmate in hopes he can force her two young children to tell him where their dad hid the proceeds from his final bank robbery.  Shelly Winters plays the doomed widow well and in a manner very reminiscent of her performance in A PLACE IN THE SUN.  Silent screen beauty Lillian Gish has the third starring role as a brusque but saintly, elderly foster mother who ultimately becomes a savior.  The two child actors playing John and Pearl do amazing jobs and have lots of screen time in which they prove they can do more than look scared.  The rest of the cast of supporting actors all bring a certain creepy small town flavor to their assorted roles.

The movie is heavily laden with symbols some of which are a bit obvious but fit the overall style of the film.  The story wavers a bit during a trial and mob scene late in the film but redeems itself again by the movie's fable like closing scene. Vocal music is used to good effect several times throughout the movie though I was not fond of the overdone instrumental music that seemed to be the murderous preacher's theme.

Eventually the kids escape and he chases after them for a final showdown in the home of an elderly foster carer.

The Night of the Hunter is basically a vehicle to watch Robert Mitchum play a very scary psycho. There is a classic scene where Powell wrestles with his own hands to tell a biblical story of the struggle between love and hate. Watching the widow deteriorate while at his command is also shocking. Overall this is powerful storytelling through and through and Mitchum turns into one the darkest of characters ever to loom upon the silver screen.",1212883200,5,973,4.591954022988506

He hates them so much, he murders them for money.

Shelley Winters is superb as the widowed Willa Harper, whose husband happens to meet Powell in prison.  Convinced by the town to marry such a great catch, Willa slowly devolves into Powell's slave abiding by his every wish.  As if God sent him to her to make her pure again, she believes him--hook, line and sinker! ; )

415409,5,6301973232,"The story may be simple - two children, John and Pearl, are pursued by the evil 'Preacher' who killed their mother and is after the money their father stole - but there is nothing in cinema to compare to The Night of the Hunter. Both Robert Mitchum's stunning extroverted performance and the film itself were shamelessly plundered by De Niro and Scorsese for their all but inept remake of Cape Fear, but this is the genuine article. A flop in its day and plagued with censorship problems (it was banned outright in Memphis and some of the more stridently Catholic countries), Laughton's perverse fairytale of innocence and evil is far more disturbing and affecting in its subversion than modern shock tactics could ever be.

The pacing and construction are almost akin to a vintage Disney animated feature, and just as primal albeit far more explicit. Disney would never have addressed the dark undercurrents as directly as Laughton, with the traditional safeguards of family, religion and small-town values soundly undermined. Here Mitchum's preacher plays the two children against each other and their mother (the most chilling line in the film is when Mitchum tells the boy ""Well, it doesn't matter. It's me your mother believes"") while the very forces that bay for his blood at the end are the same that all but forced Shelley Winters' widow and Mitchum's psychopath together.

Here people are to be judged by their actions rather than their apparent position, with the matchless Gish as the Mother Goose with her brood of the waifs and strays of the Depression showing that the forces of good needn't be wishy-washy or wimpishly self-righteous. When she says ""I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it,"" you believe it. Through her generous performance the film radiates a faith in the power of goodness and the endurance of children (""Children are men at their strongest. They abide,"" notes Gish) that provides a direct link between Laughton's film and D.W. Griffith and ultimately heals the boy's deep wounds.

While Pearl is oblivious to what goes on around her, the boy is clearly seriously scarred by the responsibility of it all (when Gish takes out her Bible, he skulks away, and, in the film's most masterly touch, his reaction to the arrest of Mitchum's preacher is identical to his reaction to the arrest of his father. There are moments in his relationship with Gish as he edges back to trust and innocence that are among the most intensely moving in all cinema.

One of the most sensual films ever made, Night of the Hunter is also surprisingly frank in its sexual analogies. It is made clear that the children's parents' relationship was primarily sexual, with Winters' sexuality, both humiliated and rejected by the Preacher, transformed into a disturbingly blind religious devotion. Like Lucifer, a fallen angel who has made a mockery of the religion he once proposed to serve into something ""the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us,"" to Mitchum's Preacher Powell sexuality is violence, his switchblade bursting through his pocket like an erection.

It's often what happens on the sidelines that sets it so apart: the hangman coming back from executing the children's father to watch his own children, Pearl innocently repeating the hanging song the other children have been taunting them with at the beginning, the comforting singing coming from the nearby farmhouse as the children sleep in the barn only to be awoken by the Preacher's threatening rendition of 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms' (later reclaimed by Gish) in the distance.

Not nearly enough has been written about Walter Schumann's truly extraordinary score. The nocturnal journey downriver under the watchful gaze of animals benefits enormously from a simple narrative song, while the score's shifting menace, melancholy and warmth both embraces the visual and psychological aspects of the film to perfection. One of the great neglected works of the 50s, it cries out for a recording.

There is a visual mastery here that recalls Griffith at the height of his powers, with a magnificent use of light and shade (when John talks of bad men, he unwittingly summons the menacing shadow of the Preacher on his bedroom wall) and a brilliant use of sets that are at one moment realistic and the next highly stylised, often both within the same shot thanks to Stanley Cortez' remarkable cinematography. Laughton may never have directed another film, but he packed more into this one than most other directors can manage in their entire career.

Sadly, no extras apart from a trailer on the DVD - and even that has had the original captions removed.",1209340800,10,4692,4.975765306122449

The film was the one movie I never forgot.  I have viewed it hundreds of times over the years and it never loses it grip on me.

Mitchum's haunting singing of the hymn 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms' echoes eerily through my memory, as well as the vision of floating tendrils of blond hair and the shadows Mitchum's preacher cast over the children; not to mention the imagery of Mitchum's character riding a horse/mule in silhouette against the sky and the L-O-V-E and H-A-T-E tattoos that adorn his hands all create their own lasting memories.  The entire film, directed by Charles Laughton, was extremely suspenseful and fraught with true evil.  No actor  other than Robert Mitchum could have pulled this off quite a convincingly; he was perfectly cast, as well Shelly Winters in the role of the somewhat naieve mother.  Lillian Gish was excellent in her role.  Pearl and John, the young children terrorized by Mitchum in an effort to discover their secret, were played spot-on.

This is a classic horror/suspense film that never becomes dated, never loses his spell-binding power, and never loses its complete hold on the viewer.

Is it a thriller? A religious allegory?  A twisted nursery rhyme?  Whatever, Charles Laughton in his directorial debut, and only film at the helm, has concocted an original film for the ages.  Robert Mitchum not only gives the performance of his career but one of the great turns as an actor of all time as Harry Powell, self-professed preacher, definite sexually repressed psychotic.  This is a difficult role to navigate but Mitchum imbues Powell with equal amounts of menace and ironic black comedy.  He is equalled by his counterpart in the film, Lillian Gish as Miss Cooper who is equal parts Guardian Angel and tough love.  One of the indelible images of the film is Powell singing his ominous calling card hymn, ""Leaning"" outside Miss Cooper's window.  When Powell finishes Miss Cooper tearfully sings the refrain.  Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce as John and Pearl, the objects of Powell's pursuit, give nice naturalistic performances.  Lensman Stanley Cortez provides an ethereally haunting sheen to the proceedings.  If I have a quibble with the film, and it's a minute one, is that Powell doesn't get a chance to defend himself after his ultimate apprehension.  TCM labels this film as essential.

It is equal parts thriller, satire, horror film, children's adventure, and fantasy.  Night of the Hunter, despite its initial failure and lack of attention for decades, was undoubtedly way ahead of its time.

The best part of the movie is obviously Robert Mitchum who probably played the role of his life.  His chilling charm, gravely voice, and dark intentions perfectly fit the role of the evil ""Reverend"" Harry Powell.  Mitchum was able to capture Powell's nature as a religious fanatic, cold-blooded murderer, shifty snake oil salesman, hypocrite, and sexually repressed Frankenstein-ian monster better than any one else I can imagine.  That Mitchum wasn't at least nominated for an academy award for this role is unfortunate, but not terribly surprising since the movie was a commercial flop when it came out in 1955.  I think it was probably just too dark and too difficult to neatly categorize for that time.

Night of the Hunter is also made so special is by its many great scenes, scenes that stay with you long after you've watched the movie.  A handful of superb scenes are worth mentioning: in the opening minutes when Powell is sitting in the audience of a burlesque show, his look of pure hatred and raging anger is absolutely unforgettable; the wedding night between Harry Powell and Willa Harper, when Powell promises her that the marriage will never be consummated is great because of Mitchum's weird evil and Harper's anguished lust and open shame; the river scene as the children float downstream, with its great songs almost right out of a lullaby; and finally, perhaps my favorite is the silhouette of Harry Powell in the distance as he rides his horse after the children, eerily singing his own rendition of a religious tone--""leaning, leaning, safe and secure from all alarms...""  I'm getting chills just thinking about them now, and I can promise that you won't forget any of these scenes (and others) either.

Is this movie a tad dated in parts?  Sure.  Do some of the backgrounds - like those in the river scene - seem about as a real as a four-dollar bill?  Absolutely.  In the end, though, this black and white film with its inconceivable, impossible story line and characters is one-of-a-kind, unlike any movie you've ever seen and probably will ever see given the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days.  Check out Night of the Hunter.  Heck, see it a few times to get a full appreciation of its singular greatness.

415438,4,6301973232,"The talented Charles Laughton's sole directorial effort ""The Night of the Hunter"", a film noir thriller based on a James Agee screenplay was a box office flop. So discouraged was Laughton that he refused to director another film.  Little did he know that the movie has subsequently been elevated to cult classic.

The film using stark black and white cinematography establishes a clear delineation between good and evil.  Psychotic preacher Harry Powell played chillingly by Robert Mitchum arrives in a small West Virginia town exuding the personification of evil.  He's searching for a naive unsuspecting widow Willa Harper played by Shelley Winters whose husband had been a cellmate of MItchum's in prison.  Ben Harper, the husband played by Peter Graves, has stolen $10,000 killing two men and had been hanged for his trouble.  He had hidden the purloined money, telling his kids John and Pearl of the hiding spot.

Mitchum's plot was to gain Winters' confidence through religious fanaticism and then marry her in order to get his hands on the funds.  He had pulled this con many times before.  In short order Mitchum tormented Winters and the two kids trying to get that money.  The kids eventually fled using a boat to travel down the Ohio river to safety all the while being trailed by the terrifying monstous Mitchum.  They were eventually rescued by the embodiment of goodness Rachel Cooper played by silent film star Lillian Gish, who sheltered a house full of wayward kids.

Using numerous nature scenes and some spooky camera angles director Laughton and cinematographer Stanley Cortez ratchet up the suspense as the helpless kids are at the mercy of the remorseless and unstoppable Mitchum.  Mitchum, whose tattooed knuckles were an effect used in other movies, effectively played a nightmarish silver screen version of the bogeyman.",1198281600,2,1845,5.11
415439,5,6301973232,"Loosely based on an actual 1920s murder case, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER was directed by legendary actor Charles Laughton--and its failure with both critics and public derailed Laughton's directorial ambitions; it was both his first and last directorial effort.  Over the years, however, it has come into its own, and today it is regarded as one of the finest films to emerge from 1950s Hollywood.

In general, the story concerns an itinerant preacher named Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a truly unpleasant entity who believes he has made a pact with God to rob and kill unsuspecting women.  Arrested in a strip joint for auto theft, he finds himself in prison with Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who is condemned to death for a bank robbery murder--and who the stolen money hidden away.  When Powell is released, he heads straight for Harper's wife and children (Shelly Winters, Billy Chapin, and Sally Jane Bruce) in search of the cash.

HUNTER is clearly influenced by the film noir movement, but even so it would be difficult to describe as film noir per se.  The film is very deliberately artificial in style with an emphasis on remarkably beautiful and distinctly dream-like cinematography that counterpoints the darkness of the story.  The production values are memorable and direction quite remarkable, and few films have so successfully created a balance between right and wrong, good and evil.

A good deal of the film's success rests on Mitchum and legendary actress Lillian Gish, the latter of whom appears as Rachel Cooper in the second half of the film.  Mitchum is truly frightening in is evil--but he proves no great match for a truly Christian woman, who quickly sees through his pretenses and does battle with him for the lives and souls of the children he so relentlessly pursues.  What ultimately emerges from the film is both Christian allegory and a classic tale of good verses evil, about which the film makes a remarkable statement: while evil strives to be impressive, it is at best trivial and may be overcome by simple and unpretentious goodness.

It would be nice to see the film given a full bells-and-whistles release on DVD--the transfer here is acceptable but no better than what you might find on television, and the bonuses consist of a theatrical trailer and nothing more.  Even so, this is a film worthy of inclusion in any collection.  Strongly recommended.

I'm not sure what the problem with that was but I just wonder about my copy.

415441,3,6301973232,"Setting- West Virginia near the Ohio river. Shot in black and white, the story centers around a mother and 2 young children, John and Pearl, whos father is hanged for robbery and murder. The mother ends up quickly marrying a man masquerading as a preacher who she barely knows. It turns out hes some kind of psychotic and is out for money and hes willing to go to any length to get it. It amazed me how quickly she was brainwashed by this guy. Everyone around them seems to think this preacher is a good guy. He only reveals his true nature to the ones who he is trying to get something from. Behind closed doors hes another person but the son seems to sense something funny about this guy off the bat though the daughter is more captivated by his fake charm.. though soon she too finds out what a monster he is.

Soon one thing leads to another and he ends up going after the children who know of where the money is hidden. From there the children are trying to escape from this preacher with the money and their lives.  The religious dialogue was a bit too much but i understand that this guy was trying to come off as a preacher and he was really convincing. It makes you think about how you never really know who someone truly is and what their motives are... Especially strangers.

Some of the images have a sense of peace about them and others are disturbing, Its like a disney film meets horror. Except without the animation.. sort of fairytale like yet sinister foreboding that can occur at any moment. It was hard to follow at times and almost put me to sleep with the dreamlike visuals and boring dialogue. Other than that it was decent. Its a very old movie and you will probably either love it or hate it.

As for me i cant really decide on this one. I see the merit of it but it slightly disapointed me. I was expecting something completely different.  On one hand i thought it was somewhat boring and predictable, on another i cant seem to get those images out of my mind and when i think of the images i think greatness. Many of the images are unforgettable and unique.

A preacher can do that? Well I had to remember 3 years earlier that it was not a good thing to be a minister if your name was Jim. I know watch this, and say that despite the collar that ministers are just like us they're human. The two children John and Pearl are two sheep. Pearl is young and trusting; all she wants is a family to belong to, and after her father goes to prison, and is hung, she clings to Preacher Harry Powell for salvation. John on the other hand loved his father, and was upset he had to die; I mean after all he was providing for his family wasn't he? Financial depression can make everyone do alot of desparate things. However, John learned one thing from his father that really hindered him throughout most of this movie, and that was ""God will help you if you help yourself."" Unfortunately, if you're doing all the work, and not allowing God into the picture you can't experience God's blessings, but when Harry Powell marries John's mother played by Shelly Winters he sees that his skepticism was right on. Back to Harry Powell he's really knowledgeable about being a man of God, but he keeps looking to get his hands on the money that John's father stole, and dismissing it as the Lord providing for his needs. Little did Harry know when he kills John's mother that he would bring a whole town into backsliding. I remember the scene after Powell's arrest that the same people he considered friends now wanted him crucified, and the thing was they were sounding rather stoned drunk if you ask me. How is a little child to react to something like this? Well fortunately John begins to learn about God, and who he is when a elderly woman played by Lillian Gish teaches him about God in the Bible. I found that alot of people's ideas about religion were expressed in this film, and unfortunately, depending on the preachers out there people may be fed the wrong ideas. We have to read the word of God, and be able to discern if the preacher is telling us God's word true, or false. If you're not a Christian still watch with a minister...in fact it's my belief this should be shown in church as a tool to show non-Christians that Harry Powell's way isn't the right one.",1184544000,3,2357,4.383561643835616

""No. And he ain't no preacher either.""

In my opinion Lillian Gish, the wonderful silent film actress, is the real prize in this film. She embodies the little goodness that may be left in the world. She is the willing instrument of God -He always picks the weakest and least of us for His purposes- in the plan to protect children from evil.

The film starts starts with a warning against false teachers, and thus, plainly states what the story is going to be about; so there's no need to waste words explaining anything. It just amazes me how well it measures the amount of evil and destruction that is around us, and how little goodness and inocence. Children and an old woman, that's all the goodness you will find. Everybody else is rotten, and they'd better repent and humble themselves before it's too late. Not only the false preacher, instrument of the devil, but everybody is guilty. Just pay attention. Who is not guilty of something here? Even the poor kids' old uncle won't help them -he is drunk when most needed-. And what about the officer in charge of killing the ones who are sentenced to death? He ain't happy either with what he has to do, however, he would rather keep his job. Not to mention the mob: such a crowd of hypocrites and gullible people.

Yup. Methinks there's enough guilt stinking around for everyone to have a little sniff. But for the innocent children. I loved, though, how the old lady gave an earnest spanking to the boy when he wouldn't wash.

No kid should skip this movie. It can be a spiritual experience out of which may grow, some day, some good seed in their hearts.

Still, some people will say this is not a Christian movie... or even worse: that it exposes Christians thru their hypocrisy.

Beware of false teachers; know them by their fruits. And love the Lord first and foremost.

P.S. And how about being located in the South? You say that people in the North are not so gullible and fanatical? Well, I say that if that's so maybe they are already dead (spiritually). Long live the South.",1171670400,8,2060,4.533692722371968
415466,5,6301973232,"The best kind of horror comes not from monsters or ghosts, but from other human beings. ""Cape Fear,"" ""Heavenly Creatures,"" and other such movies are brilliant examples of this.

But one of the most compelling examples is ""Night of the Hunter,"" a haunting movie that slowly descends into an exquisitely-filmed, brilliantly-acted nightmare about a malign preacher and the two children who are trying to escape. Like an old fairy tale, it's full of terror, magic, beauty and darkness.

Murderous preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is arrested for car theft, since the police don't know that his hatred of women has led him to repeated murder. He shares a prison cell with bank robber Ben Harper (Peter Graves), who stole ten thousand dollars. Powell tries to coax the location of the money from Harper, but the thief takes it to his grave. Only his son John (Billy Chapin) knows its location.

Upon his release, Powell arrives in Harper's town, claiming that he wants to ""bring this small comfort to [Ben's] loved ones."" Everyone is taken in by him, including his new wife -- Ben's gullible widow, Willa (Shelley Winters). When she vanishes, John and his little sister Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) must escape their evil stepfather -- even though he's determined to hunt them down and find the money.

When it was first released, ""Night of the Hunter"" flopped completely. Not very surprising -- the 1950s audiences weren't ready for the unconventional villains, rich symbolism, or the fact that an actor had dared to stray into a director's chair. Fortunately, it lived on as a cult film, and is now regarded as a classic.

It's especially sad that Laughton never directed again, because this is simply astonishing. It feels like a fairy tale, with Powell as the wicked witch, and the children as the protected innocents who are helped by a ""fairy godmother."" Laughton also loads it down with sexual and religious symbolism -- the LOVE and HATE tattoos, the switchblade, the eerie sacrifice scene.

Best of all is the cinematography. Beauty and horror are inextricably tied together: the dead Willa with ""her hair waving soft and lazy like meadow grass under flood water,"" or the little river animals watching the children escape under a starlit sky. But there are also moments of pure terror, such as the preacher's shadow falling over the kids, or calling out as they're hiding, ""I'm out of patience, children. I'm coming to find you now...""

Robert Mitchum played another evil stalker several years later in the superb ""Cape Fear,"" but this performance is even better. His Powell is a seething mass of murderous fervour and sexual hatred -- his intense eyes are enough to give you goosebumps.

He's also backed by some excellent performances -- Chapin is amazing as the little boy determined to obey his father and somehow stop Powell. Bruce and Winters turn in some solid performances, and veteran Lillian Gish has a good supporting role as the kindly Rachel.

As chilling and compelling as when it was first released, ""Night of the Hunter"" is a vibrant, primal experience, and nobody has quite come close to what it portrays.",1169424000,,3127,4.929657794676806

Now there is an actor who would no doubt have attracted more critical garlands if he had not been so incredibly popular, if he had not intercepted such a variety of roles, and if a sardonic air of self-deprecation did not tend to obscure a high talent... If he had decided to specialize in villains, he might even have come to out-play the great Bogart because, to the menace they both could share, Mitchum was able to add a genuinely frightening brutality...

In 1955 Charles Laughton went round to the other side of the cameras to direct one and only one motion picture... Laughton used every cinematic device of camera-angle, sound and lighting to tighten the tensions...

Mitchum played a psychopathic preacher with a restrained malice who married and murdered Shelley Winters for her money - only to find that her young children had it, and he proceeded relentlessly to terrorize them...

Released in 1955 and marking the directorial debut of actor Charles Laughton, it features some of the most famous and legendary shots in cinema. Yet few people have heard of the film. I've never met anyone who has seen the movie and I discovered it through Roger Ebert's ""The Great Movies."" The movie is a horror film, essentially, that still retains its haunting effect 51 years later. The movie doesn't have the look or feel of an old movie. Yes, it's in black & white but it has a timelessness to it. It looks as if it could've been made recently and digitally colored b&w. The young girl in the movie even bares a SLIGHT resemblance to a young Christina Ricci. The movie stars Robert Mitchum as ""Reverend"" Harry Powell, a character that has inspired countless other characters. Anyone watching the film will feel a hint of deja vu when they see Powell's knuckles on his right and left hand. One is tattooed with the word ""Love"" and the other with ""Hate."" This is something that has been in countless movies (""Do the Right Thing"" for example). Powell could easily be one of the most sinister and evil characters to ever inhabit a movie (although you can't place him in the same category with someone like Leatherface or Freddy Krueger). While in prison for stealing a car, Powell meets a man who has been sentenced to death for shooting two people during a bank robbery. The money has not been recovered, but Powell knows it will be somewhere near the mans house. Upon his release, Powell finds the man's house and begins courting the mans gullible widow Willa Harper (Shelley Winters). Willa doesn't know where the money is, her two children John and Pearl do. John doesn't trust Powell and convinces Pearl not too as well. Then Willa and Powell are married and soon, Willa is dead. Afraid that they will be killed once Powell gets hold of the money, the children flee via boat. They are taken in by a Bible-thumping woman (Lillian Gish, 'Broken Blossoms'), who is a lot tougher than she appears to be. Two of the most famous shots in cinema are in this movie. One is a graceful, poetic, and haunting shot of Willa's corpse at the bottom of the river...This is the most oft-mentioned shot of the film and rightfully so. It's incredibly eerie and very effective. The other is the shot of Gish sitting on her porch with a shotgun, while Powell stands on the other side of the fence singing. Laughton, who directed only this one film, could've gone on to be a legendary director. ""The Night of the Hunter"" is a very surreal film, where nothing seems real. It's very dreamlike. Some of the scenes in the film look like they could've been inspiration for several David Lynch films (notably an early scene where Powell watches a showgirl). It's odd when a movie that's rarely mentioned has been so inspiration to later filmmakers. Timeless is a term that's used way too much when talking about movies. Movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca are called timeless, but let's face it...Those movies are old and you can tell. This is a movie that someone who HATES old movies (and there's a lot of people like that) might enjoy. It's a masterpiece of the horror genre and a great film, with Mitchum delivering a downright creepy performance.

415472,5,6301973232,"**I tried to make as little known about plot lines; I will try to be as vague about this film as possible.**

Night of the Hunter is one of those rare films that hasn't won any awards and simply got stored as a film that doesn't seem to get much play on television. Yet, NOH passes the test of time in such formidable ways. The storyline and believability of the plot and characters remains strong, as does the top-notch cinematography.

Film buffs, photography students, and all those who are fans of camera work, please, do yourself a favor; purchase this film, pop some popcorn and then pop the flick in your player, and prepare yourself to be mesmerized by 93 minutes of a film gem. The scenes get better and better as the movie rolls on, and by the time Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish) makes her grand entrance towards the end of the film, you'll probably have already grabbed your handkerchief or shirt sleeve to wipe away the tears, several times over.

How can I impart to film buffs and those who enjoy ""eye candy,"" to please become an owner of this treasure? NOH is rarely spoken of when it comes to must-haves in feature movies. When you see the list of talent, it seems like a quiet film that made its debut in the 1950's, not produced to try for blockbuster status. And people didn't recognize the film then, except perhaps that they didn't embrace its style. It's been over half a century since, and NOH is an opportunity for you to turn off your cellphone and let yourself journey with John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl Harper (Sally Jane Bruce) as they depend on each other to survive what happens within their family.

By the time Miss Rachel appears, you simply want to cry on her shoulders yourself. Ms. Gish commanded the performance, and seemed to be the only one (along with John) who had any real common sense to understand the unfolding situations.

Fortunately, most of the film seemed to take place in the night, and Stanley Cortez took control of his shots and of the lighting in such extraordinary ways. **slight spoiler info, very slight** One scene worth a note: look past the ""spider's web"" and the other things during the boat ride; put yourself in the mind of a child, and watch them from that kind of perspective, to understand and appreciate these scenes. At first, I was put off by the perspective of some things, but now, I thoroughly enjoy this passage. **end spoils**

The interesting thing I observed about NOH is that especially now, this kind of unfolding drama could happen in real life. Nothing in it is beyond reasonable. And that's the chilling thought that coursed through my mind after watching it again. Imagine the point of first contact between John and the preacher. The style of filming is so deep-thought. I also found that Cortez was a photographer, and each scene he composed shows that very foundation.

After you watch NOH, place it in an easy-to-get location, because you'll want to watch it again and again. If not for the gorgeously-thought out settings, for perhaps the excellent songs contained within the film.

The Night of the Hunter is just such a movie.  Released in 1955 and directed by Charles Laughton, - the wonderful actor,  his only accredited movie for directing -  this movie follows two children as they are being terrorized by a sadistic ""preacher.""  The preacher is determined to get the ten thousand dollars the kids' father stole before he was arrested and hanged.  John, and his little sister, Pearl, must protect themselves from the demented preacher as he tries to discover the whereabouts of the money.  Such is the basis of this stunningly disturbing film.

  The director allows the audience to see the contrasting between paradise and the inferno by showing serene scenes with horrific implications.  In two separate scenes, the director creates a church effect in ordinary places of the house.  One such scene takes place in the bedroom of the kids' mom and the preacher.  He backs up the camera far enough so that we see the outline of the room in black, emphasizing the A-line shape of the right half of the room.  Light shines in through a skylight window giving the preacher an angelic glow as he prepares to stab his wife as she lays, arms folded across her chest like a corpse, in their bed.  The director also emphasizes the contrasting serenity and horror in a scene that shows the mother of the children murdered and tied to a car under the lake.  The camera pans in, slowly sweeping over the dead in the water.  Music plays softly in the background, while the water plants wispily wave up and down, matching the music and the movement of the dead woman's hair in the water.  The horror of the situation is accentuated by the serenity and peace of the town, the people, and the children.

  Robert Mitchum plays the preacher with a quiet and intense perverseness.  The preacher with L-O-V-E and H-A-T-E tattooed on his hands was one of the greatest roles he ever played.  In the scene after he has murdered his wife, he goes into the ice cream parlor to give an explanation for her disappearance.  Mitchum crosses his arms on the counter and lays the hand with ""hate"" on it over the other hand.  His head is bowed in sorrow over his arms, and he raises it sideways to look at the woman over the counter and guarantee that his wife will not be coming back.  The look of Mitchum, with his head practically horizontal, gives the audience a strong uneasiness in light of what he has done.  Near the end of the movie, Mitchum explores this demonic quality even further.  When he gets shot by Lillian Gish's character, he screeches and yells in pain, sounding like a wounded animal.  He runs off to hide in the barn, and the style of his running also reflects that of a terrified beast who has just realized that he is mortal.  The combination of the inhuman shouts and beastly cantering show that this character was no human, but a beast in the clothing of one.

  The subtleties in The Night of the Hunter make it all the more chilling to watch.  The very simple effect of having black silhouettes against a gray night sky, or the simple singing of an old and cherished Christian hymn, are more powerful then scenes full of violence could ever be.  Even though the film ends happily, the sense of uneasiness remains, and the feeling that a dark, silhouetted preacher singing ""Lean on Jesus"" will come, knocking on the old woman's door, leaves the audience, not content, but still on edge.  This film was amazing as only a classic can be.  But, one of the things I enjoyed most about this film was seeing Lillian Gish in a speaking role.  After hearing so many people my age berate silent films for the hideous acting, I delighted in seeing her amazing performance.  Equally harsh and loving, her portrayal was a joy and a comfort to see on the screen. Above all, the film demonstrates the power of the unseen, of the things which can only be sensed; fear, terror, and peace.",1151798400,4,4045,4.573018080667594

Lilian Gish should have not come out of retirement. Shelly Winters is her usual watery mess. The children are so wooden, you can make a coffee table out of them. The editing, the continuity, the music...everything is a jumbled mess.

Turned direction of the childrens' scenes over to others because he lacked interest in them;

Attached Lillian Gish as a stamp of respectability on the tawdry mess;

Attempted to prove himself artistically and intellectually superior to young American Orson Welles in his startlingly transparent imitation of Citizen Kane's visual and allegorical qualities;

415499,4,6301973232,"Charles Laughton directs this experimental project from the mid 1950s. The end results are positive and the movie has gone on to attain cult status amongst horror aficionados.

Using a blend of european cinematic style and the theatrical melodrama usually seen on stage, the director engages the viewer in this story of the eternal struggle between right and wrong, good and evil. The not so good Reverend Harry Powell impresses and seduces the simple, god-fearing folk of rural America with a well rehearsed pastiche of how good eventually triumphs, with his tatooed hands playing the lead roles.

Good may win the day but evil has a flick-knife and he certainly ain't afeared to use it.

The film is memorable for its cinematographic value with some of the sets outrageous in their beauty and dramatic effect. The juxtaposition of Mitchum's evil (which he exudes superbly)and the innocence and simplicity of the seemingly-helpless children at his mercy, is striking and, at times, disturbing. In the end, salvation comes from an unlikey source, the outwardly benign old Miss Cooper, played by Lilian Gish. She is not so easily fooled and as a protector, she is not to be under-estimated.

This is a ""must own"" film for any one who takes cinema seriously. The action is subtly terrifying, not gory in the style of more contemporary films but thought-provoking and spiritually haunting.

The not so subtle message coming through is that people believe what they want to, because it is easier then facing the truth. But..when the truth is finally faced, there is hell to pay.

The Cinematography is excellent and the acting is top notch. Winters is superb as the longing and insecure widow, Mitchum is creepy, menacing and charismatic.

There are some shots in this that will stuck in the viewer's mind forever--the evil Powell riding on his horse while whistling, a body underwater with swirling hair, etc.  The entire film takes religion and twists it around on its head.  The wickedly bad Powell used his religious costume as a confidence man to gain the affections of others, abusing his power and influence.  Spiritual singing and the purging of evil was juxtaposed against the plight of the children who are being terrorized by Powell.

The two young children had no trustworthy adults in this movie, which is what made it terrifying from beginning to end.  The soundtrack of spiritual singing adds to the haunting nature of the on-screen drama.  It furthered the otherworldly image of the midwestern town in which Night of the Hunte was set.

415527,3,6301973232,"This was the paper I wrote for my film studies class.  We were assigned to pick a movie from a list Roger Ebert made.

 ""Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing.""  That phrase is said as we venture into The Night of the Hunter. Hailed as a great horror movie from the 50's, we are welcomed into the mind of Actor/Director Charles Laughton, as we marvel at the camera work, the acting and the overall creepy emotion of the film. The film is a story about Harry Powell, a schizophrenic preacher, who has the words Love and Hate tattooed on his hands, and how he attempts to snatch $10,000 from two children with a dead father.  The shots, camera angles, symbolism, and creativity used in the film are astounding.  My favorite scene is when the preacher is about to kill his new wife after he becomes the children's stepfather.  It's obvious I enjoyed this film very much.

 Charles Laughton became a popular actor when he stared in The Private Life of King Henry The Eighth.  His role in movies continued with films like Mutiny on the Bounty and Ruggles of Red Gap. In1955he directed Night of the Hunter, a thriller starring Robert Mitchum.  However due to commercial failure, Laughton never directed another film. I would have to say that for a one-time director he certainly did a good job.  If the film had not been a commercial failure I'm certain he would have directed many great films.

 After being imprisoned for 30 days, Harry Powell meets a man who stole $10,000 from a bank and killed two people. The man hid the money inside his daughters doll and made her and her brother swear to keep it a secret, not even telling their mother.  Powell believes that God has given him the chance to steal the money from the two kids.  Powell tries to get the man to reveal where it is by talking to him in his sleep, but that fails. After getting out of prison Harry tries to befriend the two kids, although he wins the daughters trust, the son is the one who suspects him and is afraid.  Eventually the preacher marries the mother to gain further trust, but then his psychotic beliefs catch up to him.  He kills the mother and chases the children throughout the land to get the money by any means necessary.

 An important scene is when the mother comes home and overhears Harry Powell yelling at the daughter about the money.  She starts to suspect that something is afoot. The scene then cuts to them in the bedroom.  The wife is in bed praying, and Harry is standing with his back to her.  When she finishes, Harry asks her if she overheard him with the daughter.  After questioning him about the money, he slaps her.  However, Harry has done such a good job at brainwashing her with his view on Christianity, that she does nothing and accepts it.  Harry then goes over to a window, and looks up, possibly at God.  As he looks up, she talks on calmly about how the money is tainting them.  She talks about how she knows that that wasn't the reason he married her, that God sent him here to show her the way.  He breaks his focus on the sky.  We know that the only reason that he married her was for the money, nothing else.  Knowing that the inevitable is coming, he pulls down the window shade.  We know that he is about to kill her.  He then reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out his switchblade.  His wrath is coming for her.  And when he reaches his free arm around her, she accepts her fate.  She doesn't scream like the women do in films like psycho, she doesn't make a noise.  And finally, he raises the knife high above his head.  We cut to the wife, who still doesn't make a noise and she simply closes her eyes.  That is when the scene ends.  But what makes this scene so beautiful and simplistic, is the shape of the room.  As we watch the preacher kill the wife, we see that the roof is pointed and that there are empty black spaces, on either side.  The roof resembles that of a church.  This scene, and many others, questions our beliefs.  They make us examine the possibility that perhaps our preacher is not really a man of God, but one whose ideas are warped and twisted.  The possibility that we have been brainwashed by what we believe, that our way into God's open arms in reality will just end our lives, is a scary one.

 The Night of the Hunter is a very enjoyable film.  A classic villain is created in which everyone who sees the film will find memory of the man carved into their souls.  While most of the actors in the film where probably first timers, the acting was good, or in Robert Mitchum's case, brilliant.  However, I felt this film didn't have enough emotion or darkness.  After the 2 children escape from Powel, they are welcomed into the arms of a woman who adopted 3 other children, and the film becomes rather cheery.  Even when the preacher catches up with them, it isn't as dark as before, but it's still a good movie.  Did I enjoy it? Well obviously, yes.  Were there flaws in it?  A handful.  Although it is a good film, I would not put it on the list of 100 greatest movies of all time.

What I didn't include, were the facts of the cheesy elements.  It's an old movie but the greatest example of this is unforgivable.  When the children stand outside a house and look at a canary in the window; the house is made of cardboard! When it tried to be creepy, it became cheery.  I guess I'm too used to my favorites like the Birds or the Evil Dead.",1130284800,6,5421,4.362
415528,5,6301973232,"This review is for the 2000 MGM DVD

The story opens in rural West Virginia during the Depression Era where Ben Harper (Peter Graves) robs $10,000 from a bank, killing two people and then flees to his country home.  With the police in hot pursuit, Harper hides the money in his daughter's rag doll and makes his young daughter and son vow to never disclose the whereabouts of the money to anyone.  Ben is arrested and convicted and ends up sharing a jail cell with Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who was recently arrested for auto theft.  Powell identifies himself as a preacher and constantly quotes scripture and sings spiritual hymns, but also has a set of strange tattoos on his knuckles.  One hand has the word ""LOVE"" while the other has the word: ""HATE"".  Powell learns that Ben has $10,000 hidden somewhere, and when Ben is executed Harry goes to Ben's hometown and courts Ben's widow Willa (Shelley Winters) with the ulterior motive finding the stolen money.  But in spite of this seemingly romantic relationship, Harry has a suppressed psychotic hatred for women.  This sets up the remainder of the movie where this crazed madman will resort to anything to find that stolen money.

The Harry Powell role is one of those unforgettable characters in the history of filmmaking.  On the outside he appears as a devoutly religious person, yet inwardly he's the vilest man ever to walk the face of the earth.  One of the story's prominent characters Icey Spoon (Evelyn Varden), a small town busybody, is completely bamboozled by this charlatan.  Through a good portion of this movie, I was greatly disturbed that a preacher could be portrayed as such a despicable person, but the role of Rachel Cooper played by Lillian Gish brings redemption to the story as a woman who through her maturity as a devout Christian was immediately able to discern that Harry was an evil fraud.

There are other wonderful things to like about this movie.  The cinematography is superb with some fantastic shots of county landscapes with backlit starlit skies.  There's one amazing scene where Harry is riding a horse on a ridge on a moonlit night.  The backcountry feel of the movie adds a lot to plot making to local folks appearing as more vulnerable and unsuspecting victims.  Also, there are plenty of great acting performances.

As for the DVD, the picture quality was excellent overall.  There were very few imperfections noticed in this black & white full screen presentation.  The graininess and sharpness were also very good and the sound was fine too.  The only bonus is a trailer.

415529,5,6301973232,"Night of the Hunter is one of those happy accidents which transcends both its creators' intentions and their limitations. Given its many flaws, this is far from a perfect film. Yet the same lapses in its cinematic technique: choppy editing, a strange blend  of acting styles, and uneveness in the film's cinematography and continiuity, all of which mitigate against the viewer's suspension of disbelief, lend to The Night of the Hunter the quality of a fever dream and elevate it to the level of fine art.

Everyone involved, with the notable exception of Charles Laughton, for whom this film represents his only directorial work, has, perhaps, displayed their craft at a higher level elsewhere, but the sum of this film's parts far exceeds the individual contributions of the players involved.

Approach it with an open soul and you will be touched in many ways. This is one of the relatively rare products of the Hollywood assembly line that warrants repeated viewings.

My only caveat about the current DVD release is that I suspect quite strongly that the film was originally shot and presented in a wider aspect ratio. I hope that a negative of its likely 1.85:1

original format exists and will be restored and released. To the previous reviewer who commented that it was shot on 35mm film and that therefore the 4:3 aspect ratio of the current release is  correct, I can only say: get a clue. Aspect ratio is a function of the shape of aperture of the camera used, not the size of the film stock. Given the number of reviews of the film here at Amazon and its increasingly positive reputation in the critical community, I'd suggest that there is enough interest in The Night of the Hunter to warrant a proper release.",1128038400,2,1724,4.768456375838926

Everything the negative reviews say is perfectly true: it's a mess, badly written, disjointed, dysfunctional, in parts very badly acted, and the little girl is dreadful. On the other hand it is also incredibly powerful and intensely disturbing --- or so I found it. Mitchum's love/hate scene remained with me for at least 40 years, and it was still sinister when I watched it a few minutes ago. One reviewer puts it down to the evocation of the kinds of fears and nightmares that one had as a child, and I think that must be right. Grimm's fairy-tales are similar: ridiculous, totally unrealistic, yet at the same time horrifically frightening. Children are fattened up to be eaten, threatened, lost in the woods, and ogres and bluebeards prowl around. The fact is, it's all very nasty and unpleasant and primeval. I mean prime evil. I can't really think of another film quite like it, and I don't think it's funny. All the characters, without exception, are either demented or ugly, unbearably stupid, drunken, guilt-ridden or sinister: and that includes the Lillian Gish character, who talks to herself and the camera, and whose protection of the children is seasoned with homiletic bullying. This is a Victorian world: hypocritical piety, fake virtue, heavy repression, fear of sex, serial murders, anthropomorphic nature, hanging judges, lynch mobs, the lot; and it is highly surprising to find it all thrown together in a movie made in 1955. In the end, very effective but not very admirable.",1125360000,5,1541,5.0
415531,4,6301973232,"Charles Laughton is still better known for his character roles in the thirties and forties, but he had directorial skills, and Night of the Hunter is a notable, but flawed film.  Certainly, it is some of the best work that Robert Mitchum ever did.  In addition, in the Talkie Era, this is the finest work by Lillian Gish.  In fact, this film is allegorical, pitting the hateful Bluebeard, Mitchum's phony preacher versus Gish's warm, loving religion.

Indeed, the tattoos on Mitchum's fingers, left hand HATE, right hand Love; says it all as the story of stolen money unfolds.  The children are innocence accented by moonlight cinematography, fury animals, and a Huckleberry Finn allusion, the big river as sanctuary from civilization.  Mitchum's character with a switchblade is inspiration for future Freddie Kugar's.  There are also derivations to the Frankenstein films.  The angry mob goes after the monster with pitchforks.

The minor character, teen girl, Ruby is a ward of Gish's, but she goes to town to find love with young town punks.  Her attraction to the evil preacher, and Shelly Winter's odd attachment, represents sexuality outside of the Garden.  This is strange material for 1955.

The ending of this film may have fallen victim to the Hollywood cutting room.  The mob scene is crazed, but the Preacher is whisked off safely while the DA unconvincingly assures us that the preacher will get his.  Then Gish gives out presents to the children at Christmas for a good feel ending.  Maybe the studio thought a lynching of a criminal was too harsh for a story with innocent children.",1124668800,2,1597,4.973584905660378
415532,4,6301973232,"""The Night of the Hunter"" is a cinematic thriller like nothing you would find in the modern era.  This movie relies solely on plot, dialogue and setting to create an eerie and tense setting.

The plot is very simple, but at the same time very complex, due to the characters involved.

Ben Harper robs a bank and is being chased by the police at the start of the film.  He manages to find his way home and bury the money that he stole.  He only tells his two children where the money is hidden, because ""your mother doesn't have the common sense you do.""

He makes the children swear that they will never tell anyone where the mooney is hidden.  Well, Ben is sentenced to death, but while in prison he meets Harry Powell, a preacher, with very different methods to his preaching.  Harry has the classic 'L O V E' and 'H A T E' tattooed on his fists and is very emphatic in the words and actions he speaks.  Harry is very interested in the money that was stolen by Ben and tries to get as much out of him as he can, before Ben is hung to death.

When Harry is freed from prison, he immedialty sets out to make an impression on Ben's family.  He ends up marrying Willa, Ben's widow and is quick to assure her that it was for the ""spiritual binding of two lifes"" rather than the lust many men marry a women for.

In perhaps the oddest honeymoon evening in the history of time, Harry scolds Willa for her attempts to attract him into sexual partaking and forces her to view herself in a mirror.  While she is looking at herself, he coldly tells her how her body is intended solely for children-bearing and not for the pleasures of men---quite a romantic.

Anyway, it does not take Harry long to figure out that the children are aware of where the money is hidden.  And, he immedialty goes to work on them. Constantly hounding and scaring them, into trying to ""slip-up"".  This is where the movie gets its creepiest moments from.  Just the way in which the preacher talks to the children; and, with the cold, emotion-less tones he takes with them, you truely feel heart-broken and desparate for them---THIS IS THEIR NEW FATHER...They have no escape.  And when Willa dies(or is murdered), they are left alone with him.

I don't want to get too much further into the plot, as to save the rest of the movie for your viewing.  But, there is one particularily eerie scene that sticks out in my mind.

Harry has two tunes that he is constantly singing.  They must be old hymnals or psalms or something, because I have never heard them.  But the children manage to escape after their mother dies and run as far away as they can----which for children of their age, couldn't have been more than a few miles.  Well, one night, as they are sleeping in an abandoned barn, they are suddenly woken by the tune ""Leeaaning; Leeaaning"" in the distance.  On the horizon, they see the preacher slowly riding a horse.  For some reason, and I think that it a combination of the song and the slow pace he is riding the horse at; this is a very creepy scene!!!

The movie is a must for any fan of black and white films and is really a great trip back in time.  I love the dialogue in this film, because the sayings and words used are just sooo old.  Also, Uncle Bertie is hilarious as the children's drunk uncle.

Fun movie, well worth a rent and definetly one suitable for the children, although they would probably be terribly bored.

It's not the story that matters so much as how it's told, as directed by Charles Laughton in his one (credited) directorial effort. It is said he never directed again because the reviews of ""The Night of the Hunter"" discouraged him so much.

Robert Mitchum is ""Reverend"" Harry Powell, a self-appointed preacher who preys upon lonely widows - ""What'll it be now, Lord? Another widow?"" - killing them for their money as he believes the Lord has instructed him, and then moving on to the next victim. While in prison briefly on a car-theft rap, he shares a cell with Ben Harper (Peter Graves, best known for his role on the old TV show ""Mission Impossible"").

He tries to worm the location of the money from Harper before the execution. When he is released from his brief prison stay, he heads straight for Willa Harper (Shelley Winters); Ben's weak, sweet, sexually frustrated, somewhat dense widow, and her two kids.

There is just so much going on in this film: biblical references and symbolism; Freudian symbolism (Powell's knife brandished in a couple of scenes as a warped version of a phallic symbol); Mitchum's and Gish's amazing performances; various other, interesting, smaller storylines; a scene reminiscent of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" (1919); Powell's tattoos of ""Love"" and ""Hate"" on his knuckles; and the dream-like, surreal riverboat escape sequence. The children, played by Billy Chapin (John Harper) and Sally Jane Bruce (Pearl Harper) give effective performances. There's also the over-the-top campiness in some of Mitchum's acting, which fits in perfectly with the stylized direction of the film; the sexual undercurrent and its repression that runs throughout (and no one played whiny, sexual frustration in those days better than Shelley Winters, as evidenced by this and other roles such as the mother in ""Lolita"" (1962): ""Harrrrrry! I'm lonnnnnnnely!"" and her role as the cast-aside pregnant girlfriend in ""A Place in the Sun"" (1951).

Lillian Gish is wonderful in her portrayal, standing up to the evil Harry Powell, and Robert Mitchum is perfectly cast in what some see as his best film role; his charismatic, handsome, oily, smooth portrayal of the serial killer Harry Powell surely must stand as a study guide for today's actors. Mitchum seemed to reprise much of his technique for this performance for his subsequent role in ""Cape Fear"" (1962).

I really can't say much more without going on and on for pages. Each scene could be written about and analyzed in detail; each scene is lit and photographed and told in a manner that has a director's hand prints all over it. It's a true artist's film, and we will never know what other wonders Charles Laughton could have directed. I have read of some viwers who laughed through much of this movie, which is unfortunate. I find it difficult to comprehend that reaction from any intelligent viewer who was really paying attention. I guess you either ""get it"", or you don't, which may have something to do with the film's dismal success when it was released.

This under-appreciated film is a ghoulish twist on a classic story, directed (and mostly written, it is said, by Laughton, after his arguing with James Agee over the rendition of the screenplay) in a masterful manner by a man best known for his own portrayals of classic film characters such as Captain Bligh in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), and Quasimodo in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939).

The hymn ""Everlasting Arms"" recurs throughout, and could never sound the same again after this film.

He marries a weak willed and dimwitted widow played by Shelly Winters who was really great in character roles where she had to be pathetic. The widow was married to a bankrobber who's loot was never found. Mitchum's character assumes that Shelly knows where the money. When it's clear that she doesn't he turns on her young children.

Luckily, the oldest child is just mature enough to figure out that beneath the smiling surface there's something wrong with their new step dad. It's amazing to watch Mitchum go from being smarmy and fake, the way adults sometimes are with children to an out and out boogey man.

415560,5,6301973232,"Perhaps the least prolific writer/director to create a masterpiece in a class of its own - almost - was Charles Laughton, who wrote and directed ONE movie in 1955 called ""The Night Of The Hunter"" with Robert Mitchum as a demonic preacher, Shelley Winters in a fine role, and Lillian Gish at her best.  Charles Laughton was 7 years from the end of his 55-film acting career (that began in 1928) when he made Hunter, a film that had little commercial success upon its release, but has since achieved cult status.  When I first caught Hunter as a afternoon movie broadcast, I was mesmerized by its haunting mood, earthy characters, photographic brilliance, and perfectly matched soundtrack music.

Decades later upon first seeing Terrence Malick's Badlands (1973), I remembered a movie from my distant past that evoked the same awe, starred Mitchum, and was directed by Laughton.  It was at the IMDb site years later that I was able to ID it as ""The Night Of The Hunter"".  My most memorable similarity noted between the two masterpieces was the cinematography - clever camera angles, sweeping stark landscapes, menacing crime scenes on land and water, and above all the frequent close-ups of animal and plant life, the latter with time-lapse growth montages.  Hunter was a remarkable directorial debut for Laughton as was Badlands for Malick, whom I suspect was somewhat influenced by his predecessor.

Ever since I first caught Badlands as a late-night movie broadcast, I have been mesmerized by its haunting mood, earthy characters, photographic brilliance, and perfectly matched soundtrack music - so much so that I am compelled to watch broadcast after broadcast.  After buying first the VHS then the remastered DVD, I am still left wanting the ultimate package that would feature not only better widescreen video and richer surround sound, but also a seperate bonus audio soundtrack with all the musical selections, especially those by Carl Orff and Gunild Keetman.  Fans of this movie have long lamented the absence of a published soundtrack.  For more info on the actual Badlands Orff/Keetman cuts, see my review at Amazon 'Soundtrack for the Terrence Malick 1973 movie ""Badlands""?'.

We who hold Badlands in high regard have also bemoaned the two-decade drought of directorial output by Maestro Malick that ended with a poorly edited theatrical release of ""The Thin Red Line"".  ""Days Of Heaven"" was nearly on par with Badlands, but then did Orson Welles ever have a realistic shot at surpassing Citizen Kane with HIS subsequent efforts?

Interestingly, 43 years passed from the premiere of Hunter until the soundtrack CD was finally released in 1998 with narration throughout by Laughton (published in 1955 on LP, now a collector's item in the $100+ bracket)!  I just discovered the existence of this CD today while surfing IMDb, prior to writing this review, in an Amazon link.  Perhaps there is hope we may see a Badlands soundtrack release before 2016, maybe with some Sissy Spacek narration and Martin Sheen dialog as seperate tracks.",1108771200,4,3043,5.070140280561122

415563,4,6301973232,"Night of the Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955)

Charles Laughton, who acted in Hitchcock's films The Paradine Case and Jamaica Inn, obviously took a page from the master when he got behind the camera for his first and only directorial effort, Night of the Hunter. It sure doesn't look like a debut film; it's another of those Hitchcock films that Hitch didn't make (like Edward Dmytryk's 1965 thriller Mirage).

Robert Mitchum (Cape Fear, The Big Sleep, and over a hundred others) is Reverend Harry Powell, an all-around nasty guy who exudes an air of menace wherever he goes. He makes his living, when not preaching, by marrying widows, stealing their money, and killing them. Willa Harper (The Great Gatsby, Lolita, and over a hundred others) just happens to be a new widow; Powell, in jail on an auto theft charge, happens to share a cell with Harper's husband, being executed for bank robbery. So Powell knows Harper has a bundle of cash lying around (even if Harper doesn't; the police caught up with her husband before he could tell her where he hid the money), and from there, the rest is obvious.

To really get the most out of Night of the Hunter, think of it as a David Lynch film based on a Hitchcock script adapted from a Carlos Castaneda-penned hardboiled thriller. Nothing is as it seems; one reviewer has stated that in his opinion, the whole movie takes place inside Willa's son's imagination, explaining the whole movie's odd, dreamlike quality (that would later be center stage in the films of such directors as Lynch, Jodorowsky, and Terence Malick). Mitchum is brilliant, if a scenery-chewer a la Charlton Heston, and Winters is really quite good. Lillian Gish (another in the hundred-plus movies category) comes off a bit overbearing, but that makes sense given the kid's-nightmare explanation (once you get a feel for her character, you'll understand).

This is a movie people either love or hate. Me, I'm quite fond of it. Not sure it deserves its lofty place on IMDB's top 250, but its importance and watchability are unquestionable. ****",1090800000,9,2060,4.877142857142857

In all earnestness, I can tell you that you have never seen anything like this film. It's radiant, malefic, grim, uplifting, odd, and sardonic all at the same time. It's like every night terror you ever had that you can't quite remember the next morning, or, if you could remember it, you couldn't quite put it into words.
Robert Mitchum is superb as an insanely charismatic psycho-killer. But this movie really isn't about him. It's about universal themes of longing, monsters, chasing, and escape.
This is an elegant treatment of the dark side of the human psyche, and the ultimate triumph of human light over the dark side.

Many talk about Mitchum as the sole villian of the film.  I believe that is incorrect.  The film is full of villians.  From the moment their father burdens John with the stolen money and swears him to secrecy, John and his sister Pearl are no longer able to function as children.  They are under attack from every angle.  Their mother fails to protect them.  The townspeople they live with gossip about them, judge them and even chase them with torches after Mitchum's trial.  The other children in the film fare no better.  Ruby is used by young men.  Lillian Gish's Willa Harper has a whole house full of children who have been abandoned by the adults in their lives.  It is her character alone in this film that understands that being an adult means protecting the innocence of the young.  Her final scenes with John, Pearl and with Ruby are extremely moving.  So too is the moment at the end in John can keep his father's secret no longer - wailing, ""No...No...Noooo"" finally tantruming like a child instead of acting as one of the only ""adult"" characters in the film up to that point.
It is interesting to me that a film with such a post-modern visual aesthetic comes down so squarely on the side of faith and innocence.  Too bad we so rarely see that juxtaposition in the rest of our culture.  A masterpiece pure and simple.",1088208000,6,1589,4.477351916376307
415606,5,6301973232,"From the novel by Davis Grubb - the first and only film directed and purportedly written by the flamboyant and swashbucking actor, Charles Laughton.  In Robert Mitchum's  biography, he stated that Laughton found the script by James Agee (co-writer of the African Queen) totally unacceptable. Laughton paid off Agee, sent him packing and rewrote virtually the entire script himself, uncredited.
This 1955 melodrama cum Grimm's Fairy Tale is brilliantly directed, acted, scored and the cinematography by Stanley Cortez is breathtakingly creepy and beautiful all at the same time.
Mitchum plays the sexually repressed, thieving, lying, cheating and quite sociopathic Rev. Harry Powell.  The ol' Rev. got caught in a stolen vehicle while watching a ""hootchie cootchie"" dancer in a burlesque establishment and is sentenced to 30 days in the state penitentiary.  It just so happens as fate takes a turn that the scheming Rev's bunkmate is in the clink for killing two men and robbing a bank of over $10,000.00 that has never been recovered.
The Rev. tries to get the ""sinner"" to tell him where the money is hidden but the man won't budge.  The man is hanged for his crime, the Rev. is let out of jail and goes to find the man's wife, played by Shelley Winters, his two young children and , of course, the loot! The Rev. even marries the young widow to get to the money and many evils ensue...  Lillian Gish turns in a wonderful performance as a benefactor of the children.
I don't want to spoil the premise of the movie as other reviewers have done.  Just know that it's a horror/fairytale/melodrama/satire all rolled into a great piece of filmaking!

415608,4,6301973232,"'Night of the Hunter' probably deserves special recognition not only as a Hollywood classic, but as a product of the studio system in which an unproven director and screenwriter managed to create a truly unique work.  Obviously influenced by European film and literature (as the house reviewer deftly explained), this is still an indisputable product of America that works as parable, social criticism, art and entertainment.
The look of the film is probably its most noteworthy aspect-- stark, fantastic, and atmospheric, it manages to capture a haunting slice of existence as seen from the eyes of the very young, even as it maintains a highly intellectual tone.  The performances are top-notch, with the only sour notes coming from the children on one or two occasions, and from the adults when they deliver lines to the camera in what are the only obviously dated moments within the film (these come at the very beginning and the very end, and seem more like unsuccessful attempts to incorporate theatrical elements into the film-- perhaps inevitable from a famed actor directing for the first time).
The film is full of astounding moments, from the haunting visuals of Shelley Winters as a recently-born again preacher to her appearance as a beatific corpse to the children's escape from a lynch mob.  But the most spectacular, beautiful and haunting (and I suspect for most adult viewers, the most evocative of childhood) scenes are those of the children's flight down the Mississippi River in an idyllic American wonderland of clear skies and abundant wildlife, which stand in stark contrast to the Expressionistic scenes in which they live in poverty and in fear of Mitchum's murderous preacher.
While 'Night of the Hunter' hasn't aged quite as well as some other truly American cinematic classics, its sensitive portrayal of life in America and the historical moments that define our nation more than deserves a place next to the best, a la 'Bonnie & Clyde,' 'Little Big Man,'and 'Ride the High Country.'",1079395200,4,2013,5.075528700906345
415609,1,6301973232,"I am still wondering why this film has so much admiration, being called brilliant, a masterpiece, terrifying, etc. etc. Because I was laughing most of the way through it...this film is HOKEY, folks! I was not scared at all; much of the plot was predictable ( I knew right away where the money was hidden), the acting was bad (even Robert Mitchum's performance was so silly), the music a bit too out front and not compatable at times, the sets cheap (like that ""cardboard"" barn and the string spiderweb), the story did not flow smoothly and was not always understandable, character/relational development was lacking...I could go on. Really, I couldn't believe how amateurish this film came across.
The reason I watched it is not because I like ""scary/weird/disturbing"" movies. I don't. But I enjoy studying the art of classic film, and  I have seen Charles Laughton in some films, and so I was curious what he had to offer as a director. Sadly, I found it was a pitiful offering. Not that it was all Laughton's fault. For we many people work together to make the whole film come out okay. I felt this film had much potential to be a very disturbing film. But it never took off, it just floundered around, trying to be something good, but not delivering. Perhaps Charles Laughton had a vision but for some reason was just not able to bring it all together to a satisfying whole. You could see he tried hard in this film, but often I think he tried too hard. He tried to put in too much with varied camera angles, shadows, etc. A few times he almost achieves some artistic beauty...esp. the scene of the boy seeing the preacher on the ground being arrested as almost a flashback of seeing his own father in that similar situation, and when Mitchum, while sitting out front of Lillian Gish's house in the night, singing the hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"", and Lillian Gish joins in. This is a beautiful hymn; we see that the song means something much different to Gish's character than it does to the preacher.  But sadly, Laughton just did not seem to have the gift to handle these scenes exactly right.
I think it began very well, with the Bible verses speaking of how we can tell a man by his fruit...a good man brings forth good fruit, etc. Obviously, we are set up to know right away this preacher is just a wolf in sheeps clothing. I think the ending could have been much more effective if they had had Bible verses being quoted by Lillian Gish at the end too...to reinforce this concept. Or to have quoted other Bible verses about how good always overcomes evil,or how our sin will always be found out, etc. I felt the ending Laughton left us with was too weak.
As I said, the acting overall was bad. I know it is hard to find good child actors, and that can be excused sometimes, but in a story such as this, better child actors would have helped a lot. I was glad to see Lillian Gish in something, and I felt she did well, except in the weak ending. I feel Shelley Winters was very good as a very confused, guilt-laden young mother. Robert Mitchum did not impress me at all. In the basement scene with the children, he was so silly...groping after them like Frankenstein or something...I couldn't help laughing, and this was supposed to be a very scary moment for these children. And when he had a bad experience with Lilian Gish and her gun that night at her home, and he runs off howling to the barn, well I broke out laughing! He sounded like Disney's big bad wolf, on my son's story tape,  howling as he ran away from his fall into the little pig's pot of boiling water!!! It was so so silly!! So so unreal!! Again, this should have been a very suspensful moment, and again, it just ended up very amateurish and silly. I can't say Mitchum ever really appeared scary. Couldn't Laughton see this?? He himself gave a very scary performance in The Barretts of Wimpole Street...he played Mr. Barrett, Elizabeth's oppressive, controlling, religiously-misguided and over-zealous father. The scenes where he commands the one daughter to bring the port for Elizabeth to drink and later the scene where he makes that one daughter swear an oath on the Bible are truly frightening...why? Because they were so real...the first time I watched Laughton as Mr. Barrett, it instantly brought back the exact same feelings of fear and oppression I felt with my stepfather in my childhood. A good film should have you feeling or understanding what the characters are feeling.  Laughton took part in good movie making as an actor, so it was a disappointment to see that he couldn't achieve the same realism in his own directorial efforts.
I think this is about enough. I am sorry to know that Laughton was so discouraged by the reception of this, his first effort at directing, that he never tried again. Maybe if he tried again, he could have learned from the mistakes made in this film, and could have presented us with something better. Maybe he should have tried a different genre too, not suspense. But then, maybe he just did not have the gift to be a director!
I think most people would agree that Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. Many of his films are indeed true  masterpieces. But of course not all were...noone is perfect!
As for films that were truly frightening to me (besides Hitchcock ones), I thought ""Sorry, Wrong Number"" was very very effective in that regard, as was ""Sudden Fear"" with Joan Crawford. I thought ""The Bad Seed"" was also quite frightening, but in that one, there were a few moments of hokiness as well.
This is a film where one watch was more than enough for me. However, one good use for this film would be in a film class; it would serve as a great example and topic of discussion of errors in movie making.",1077235200,30,5751,4.558027079303675

And it has fine performances from the main cast - and an interesting portrayal of the American South in the depression era - compare it for fun's sake to the Coen Brothers'  O Brother, Where art Thou?

There is a relevant moral as well - the blood-thirstiness of 'false prophets' is as relevant today in every religion, as it is in this movie...

The best reason to watch however is the depiction/portrayal of the child character Pearl - one of the 2 kids being 'hunted'. If there has been a more delightful and authentic child character in film, I haven't seen it. And there are no gimmicks used here - none of the syrupy cuteness a la ""Sound of Music"", nor sitcom style clever lines, nor any attempt to string tears out of the viewer.

No - ""Pearl"" steals every scene she is in - at least for me - simply by being there - and being the kid she is supposed to be - utterly naive, trusting, greedy for candy, and so on. Whether it is her Southern curls - or her baby face in a bonnet, or simply her nodding to acknowledge she is making a promise, the way she drags her doll, or naively adopts a song that other children sang that actually mocks her hanged father - she is priceless.

415612,5,6301973232,"Charles Laughton, one of the greatest actors of Hollywood's Golden Age, made his directorial debut at age 56 with ""Night of the Hunter."" The film flopped so badly with critics and public that Laughton was never allowed to direct a movie again. It's hard to tell which is worse: the tragedy for the cinema, or the idiocy of the critics and the public. ""Night of the Hunter"" deserves to be ranked with ""Citizen Kane"" and the works of Pabst and Murnau among the great Expressionist film masterpieces. Its artiness probably meant it would never be a great popular success, but it deserves to be more than a cult favorite. Its combination of stark realism and extreme stylization, of magical beauty and Hitchcockian suspense, has never been replicated in any other movie. The performances are all superb and, in the cases of Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish, extraordinary. Mitchum pushes the envelope just enough as the evil preacher Harry Powell, giving a performance that might seem way over the top if a scene were taken out of context, but which masterfully evokes diabolical menace as a whole. As for Gish, she creates an unforgettable character in Rachel Cooper, whose prim, strict exterior barely conceals a combination of wisdom, backbone and moral splendor rarely found in the cinema. Shelley Winters is also very fine as a woman blinded by desire and guilt. Too little, I think, has been said of the supporting players in ""Night of the Hunter."" Billy Chapin is very touching as the little boy Powell menaces, but the standouts have to be Don Beddoe and Evelyn Varden as Walt and Icey Spoon, a sort of Richard and Hyacinth Bucket gone to seed. Icey is all idiot compliance with the loathsome Powell, taking his protestations of piety at face value while imagining herself the arbiter of morality and common sense. Walt, her henpecked husband, occasionally voices doubts but is quickly brought into line. So when Powell is revealed as the murderous monster he is, who leads the lynch mob? Why, Walt and Icey, of course! There are hundreds and hundreds of Walts and Iceys in small-town America. I know that firsthand.",1068854400,3,2119,4.872576177285318

Now that i have seen it, i find myself in agreement with several of the earlier pans listed below.  The acting really was amateurish.  The editing turned the film into a quagmire of choppy scenes in which the viewer is constanting getting lost.  I really loved the arty look of the film (the cinematography was very good - several scenes were visually stimulating, but such diamonds in such a rough desert sand!).
Overall, a mess. You would do well to steer clear of this film unless you want something to have to which you can compare well-made, tightly-structured, professionally-made films.  This movie has the annoying resonance of fingernails on a chalkboard.
For those of you who cherish this film or simply love it, there is little to say.  Some people aspire to shovel manure for a living.  Some would like nothing better than to guzzle pabst blue ribbon.  And even more root for the arizona cardinals (alas, I am guilty as charged on this one).  And then there are those who can actually sit back and get gratification from watching 'night of the hunter'.  What poor souls.
For those of you intrepid enough to have the courage of your convictions to post a negative review with your own name, kudos to you.  Even roger ebert is off is rocker once in a while.  Sorry rog.
For those of you on the fence as to whether or not you wish to buy this film, you may want to take the time to read through the myriad of reviews and inspect closely those who had only good things to say and those who did not.  If you detect a hint of sterility from the 4 and 5 star reviewers, you may be closer than you think to the truth.  Then again, maybe the real ringer is the price of the movie.  There is little wonder that this is one of the cheapest buys out there.  Maybe that ought to be the deciding factor, one way or the other, you know?
Cheers.

415614,4,6301973232,"When this came on Finnish television, I was much too young to see it, so I remembered only fragments of the movie - until I was ushered to bed. The film has haunted me since then and I was still unsure, if I can watch it.
After watching the film (in bright sunlight!) I was very pleased. Laughton made a magnificent film, that defies the categories. It's full of suspense but also has the same artistic, dream-like atmosphere that French older classics like Ren&eacute; Clair's ""Orpheus"". It is a frightening fairytale for adults, with artistic ambitions. The beautiful pictures go as far back as to the classic silent movies with clever, imaginative use of shadows and shapes and it makes the movie really magic at times.
Shortly: the film is about a man, a self-made preacher, who roams the country making a living by preaching and killing lonely women, who search for love. Robert Mitchum is absolutely chilling, using his good looks and droopy eyes in a very different part than usually. He's often seen as a charmer but this is a distorted version of those parts. And we all know, what makes this really memorable: the tattooed 'love' and 'hate' on his knuckles...
After hearing in jail, that a condemned prisoner in his cell has hidden somewhere 10.000 $, the preacher seeks out his widow, marries her and starts to look for the money. She doesn't even touch the wife, because lust is a sin. Until he has to - and the wife is never seen again... Unfortunately there are also the two children, the only ones who really know about the money but have sworn their father never to reveal it. The little girl is just as charmed as her mother, so time and time again she's about to tell - and when mother has 'disappeared' she does tell. Children escape miraculously and start their long journey (with the money)to safety through the depression-ridden country, sliding down the river in a boat. And on the horizon rides the preacher, forever looking for them, singing with his handsome voice: ""Leaning, leaning..."" You'll hear it for days after watching this film, believe me!
The acting varies, from Mitchum's chilling, low-key, psychological performance to Lillian Gish's old-fashioned sentimentality, from Shelley Winter's nervous, sensitive gestures to the children's very natural performance, each interesting in their own way. And watch for the bedroom scene, where Mitchum stands beside the bed, ready to get rid of his wife: how the shadows play around them and how the scene is constructed. When Laughton was filming this, he wasn't quite pleased at first, so he asked a cameraman, what he was thinking or feeling. The man answered: ""Sibelius, 'Valse triste'."" And Laughton said something like: ""Of course, this has to be made in the rhythm of a waltz!"" Yes, of course I know this: Finns are very proud of Sibelius...
The films has lost a lot of its horror effect after all the blood we are used to seeing on television, but there is the magic touch. I'd give it 4,5 stars, if possible, 5 felt a bit too much, because Laughton could have made it a bit better still. Anyway, for someone's first and only movie direction this is really something!",1062115200,,3152,4.774725274725275

The father is ready to be hanged, when he accidentally blurts out something about the wherabouts of the money to Powell (who is in the cell with him for stealing a car). Powell is soon hell-bent on finding the money, and marries the widow of the husband. The way Powell badgers and taunts the children is sadistic, and the film has some great religious concepts. Mitchum does a superb job as Harry Powell, and my second favorite character is the woman who takes in the children and loves God with all her soul. It is a battle of good vs. evil, one man who thinks he loves God, and a woman who truly does love God. All in all, a good, classic movie, but the children kind of get on my nerves. And, the wife is somewhat irritating too. But, this movie is worht the watch, especially for the scene where Mitchum explains about his tattoos that read Love and Hate.

Also, since I was a child when I saw it, I thought this was something that could really happen to someone.  (Unlike Freddy Kruger or Jason).  Also, the fact that I knew and liked the song ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" was scary because I'd never heard a criminal sing a hymn!

415658,5,6301973232,"It is as difficult to describe this film as it is to forget it. The only film directed by Charles Laughton, with James Agee's screenplay based on Davis Grubb's novel of the same title, The Night of the Hunter explores the ageless conflict between pure goodness and pure evil. The former is represented by the two Harper children and especially by their resolute defender, Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish). Pure evil is represented by Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a psychopath who claims to be a preacher. I can think of few other films in which script, direction, acting, cinematography (Stanley Cortez), and musical score (Walter Schumann) work so well together. Credit must obviously be shared. What saddens me is the fact that Laughton was so discouraged by initial reactions to the film that he never directed another. The plot is rather straight-forward and consists of three phases: Powell's arrival and subsequent marriage to widow Willa Harper (Shelley Winters); her death and the gradual revelation of Powell's true nature; and finally, his pursuit of Rachel Cooper and the two children after they flee from him. It would be a disservice to those who read this brief commentary for me to say any more about the plot.
Paradoxically, this is among the most beautiful and most frightening of films. Mitchum's portrayal is among his greatest performances. According to some who were associated with the production, he also agreed to direct Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Cooper because Laughton despised child actors. If true, Mitchum reveals an off-screen talent I wish he had developed further. For me, the only problematic performance is Gish's. Perhaps it is because it seems (to me) derivative of an acting style more appropriate to a previous era when she was featured in so many other films. Those who have not as yet seen this film are urged to do so. It is in so many ways an ""original"" which deserves the acclaim denied it when first released in 1955.",1057536000,6,1961,4.945454545454545

Mitchum is the soul of evel yet believable as someone the naieve might trust. I saw this movie with my parents when I was ten years old and had nightmares from two of the scenes for years. A classic example that you don't need blood, gore or explosions to scare people to death - only quiet, unrelenting evil.

She was more fun as a boozy guest on Johnny Carson in the 70's.  What a WACKY movie; directed by Charles Laughton of all people.  Mitchum, of course, can do no wrong. He is completely sinister and looks to be relishing his role of the widow killin' man of the cloth.  However, the direction and acting (others, not Mitchum) is so shrill and heavy-handed that it is rendered uncomfortably silly most of the time.  Moreover, the musical score they used to set the mood is as subtle as a flying mallet. This movie promises more than it actually delivers. Some nice cinemetography though.

It would be a mistake to think of Mitcheum's 'Love/Hate' tatoo'ed gothic murderer as a phony. He is a con man but he is not a hypocrite to himself because he's in touch with his version of The Almighty. One who doesn't mind killing but 'lacey things. '
This is part of the film's horror. We are in W. Virginia depression Bible-thumping rural Americana in this one.  A Protestant tour de force, with angels and devils in dust filled roads. Very ambiguous towards the feminine.
Charles Laughton's only shot as a director and brother, does he ever hit the mark! The film has obvious influences from  German expressionism--the 'A' framed steeple/ bedroom- which turns into a 'shadow church' just before Winter's murder, to give one example.  But it also borrows effectively from other genres including Greek tragedy, where not a single act of violence  takes place ""on stage"". Paradoxically, this serves to intensify the suspense. The audience feels that something horrible is about to happen to the children fleeing Mitchum's howling preacher.

415695,5,6301973232,"Update (12/25/10): I just got this on the Criterion Collection Blu-ray version.  Yowsa!  I've long loved this movie, but the degree of improvement in the new Blu-ray is absolutely shocking.  Yes, there are a host of special features, a great commentary track, and a fascinating disc of Laughton directing, the real appeal of this new version is the print.  The movie looks so good it is shocking.  I'd see this a couple of times in student film societies, owned it on VHS, and had seen it once on television, but I was completely unprepared for how beautiful it was going to look on this new Blu-ray.  One of the more recent reviewers complained of the price.  Well, yeah.  It is expensive, but you get what you pay for.  If you want a cheap, second rate copy of the movie, get the old DVD that you can get for just over $10.  But the Criterion edition, currently at $44, is worth every penny.  I really wish that Amazon would not link old reviews to Criterion editions.  The difference between a regular DVD or Blu-ray release and a Criterion is so different that they are two different animals.  This release is Criterion at its best.

What follows is my original review:

First, for those complaining that this DVD was not released in wide screen, I have to point out that this film was originally released as a 35MM print.  In other words, there never will be a wide screen edition.  People need to remember that not all films were released in 70MM format.  Since the 1950s, virtually every film is 70MM, but in the 1950s, many were still being produced with the smaller ratio.  You will also never get a ""wide screen"" edition of CASABLANCA or SEVEN SAMURAI or THE WIZARD OF OZ  and for the same reason.

This is without question one of the most improbable films ever made, and one of the most extraordinary. As many have noted, it owes its style to the German Expressionism that we normally associate with the 1920s and early 1930s. In that regard, it is film that looks and feels like no other film made in its time. Furthermore, it is the only film that Charles Laughton, one of the few superstar character actors in film history, directed. German Expressionism also was instrumental in creating film noir in Hollywood, and as in film noir, THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is dominated by shadows. But at the same time, it doesn't look like any other film noir that one can think of. The artificial night skies and stars are unique in American cinema.

But the film is not only unique in the way it looks. The detached, almost aloof manner in which the characters interact with one another is quite unlike anything else that was being done in 1955. For instance, Lillian Gish's character is willing to kill Robert Mitchum's character, but she is willing to sing hymns with him, and, in fact, seems to actually like him in many ways, though perhaps the way that a person might feel about a beautiful though poisonous snake. The detached attitude of some of the characters underscores a sense of fate in the film, a feeling that we are not always in control of our actions or masters of our destiny. Certainly that notion is reinforced in the famous and shocking sermon that Mitchum delivers, in which love and hate seem to be powers that possess the will of an individual, with the individual an observer and not an actor in his own life.

THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER has some of the most amazing characters one will ever encounter. Rev. Harry Powell is almost without debate the greatest role of Robert Mitchum's career. Even those who have never seen the film know of the device of having ""Love"" tattooed across the fingers of one hand and ""Hate"" upon the other. And Mitchum's sermon about ""Love"" and ""Hate"" contesting with one another is taken over almost word for word in Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING. Lillian Gish had been, of course, one of the greatest stars of the silent era, and while she appeared in a number of films in the talking era, this is probably her greatest role after the onset of sound. The conflict between her and Mitchum are, to me, the highpoint of the film.

The film also engenders regret. THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER is so unique and brilliant, that one can only wish that Laughton had turned his hand to directing again. Perhaps he had only one film in him. Perhaps he had the potential to make other films just as marvelous and unforgettable.",1026518400,18,4366,4.546615581098339
415696,3,6301973232,"I had a chance to see ""Night of the Hunter"" in one of our local repertory theatres.  Going in, based on the film's reputation and, to be honest, the title, I was expecting a dark and gloomy meditation on the nature of evil.  I was expecting long shots of Robert Mitchum stalking children in the swamp, maniacal terror engulfing his face, dark shadows framing his evil.  I was expecting hidden gore and destruction, as Mitchum's faux-preacher tears down everything in his path in order to retrieve $10,000 that isn't rightfully his.  I was expecting a moody, proto-noir thriller that never lets the audience loosen their grips on their seats, for fear of flying away in fright.
To my surprise, I got absolutely none of this.  Very curious.
What I did get was somewhat moody, hardly noir, and not very thrilling.  Director Charles Laughton wanted a German Expressionist feel, so he watched hundreds of hours of film from that period.  The effect it has on his film is a prevailing sense of unsettledness, where reality is distorted, and things never appear quite real.  Twisted camera angles, blinding whites contrasted with dark shadows, and intentionally fake special effects (one night sky looks like a black sheet with holes poked in it for the light of the stars to shine through) contribute to this feeling.  Archetypes and stereotypes abound, instead of real characters.  Even reality gets a good shoving aside, in favour of the ""wrongness"", the ""bizarre distortion of reality"" that best represents the genre.  Laughton's goal is certainly achieved; the look and feel of German Expressionism is ably aped.  But that doesn't necessarily make it a good, suspenseful movie.
Mitchum, despite the advanced word, comes across more as a psychotically unhinged character than a cold killer.  The unabashed anger he shows during a scene at a strip club, paradoxically contrasted by a metaphoric erection in the form of a switchblade in his pocket, isn't really horrifying.  It's not supposed to be.  Mitchum gives more of a psychological portrait of evil, rather than horrific one.  But, unlike the evil antagonists we've come to expect, his Reverend Harry Powell is, for the most part, ineffectual.  He resorts to weeping like a baby at one point, in order to hide a crime he's committed.  His face, even with those trademark droopy eyes, reminded me a lot of Peter Lorre during these very weird scenes.  This contributed much to the character; imagine Lorre's creepy deviousness combined with Mitchum's towering physique, and you get an idea of the potential of the character.  It's an interesting, revelatory performance.
The other actors are, at best, hit or miss.  Lillian Gish, as a stern bible-thumper with a brood of orphans in her care, is effective enough.  Billy Chapin, as young John Harper, has enough moments where he's in control to consider it a fine performance.  Peter Graves, as a murderer who nearly blabs the location of his loot to cellmate Mitchum, is good enough to make you wish he'd have stuck around longer.  The rest are just plain awful.  Shelley Winters hams it up as the widow who gets taken in by Mitchum.  You almost want to cheer when her ultimate fate is revealed.  Sally Jane Bruce, as Pearl Harper, gives the most awful performance I've ever witnessed by a child actor.  Thankfully, she's got a cute, Christina Ricci-esque moonface, so you can at least derive some pleasure looking at her.  Evelyn Varden, Don Beddoe, James Gleason, etc., show no amount of restraint in their acting.  It's all loud and proud emoting, which jolts you out of the story instantly.
The film hasn't aged well at all.  During moments of high suspense, a character will do something, or say something, loaded with unintended hilarity.  The audience I saw the film with couldn't stop laughing.  Now, maybe I've misread the whole thing and it was all supposed to be a big joke.  I just can't believe that's true.  What was supposed to be a white-knuckle thrill ride through Depression-era West Virginia, and I'm not denying it wasn't that at the time, is now a hokey and hammy novelty.  It's worth seeing, though, for the intense visuals, for the propulsive story (until, that is, the anticlimactic ending), and for Mitchum doing what Mitchum does best.  But dare not go in with the wrong expectations, or you're liable to be disappointed.",1026432000,5,4347,4.9217032967032965

Grubb's novel needed very little adaptation for the screen, although screenwriter Agee did his best to prove otherwise. Agee, battling severe alcoholism, died before the movie was ever released. His bloated, unworkable screenplay was entirely re-written by Laughton. At Laughton's insistence, Grubb provided his own illustrations to help the director conceive the right look and tone for the various scenes.

Ok, the boy was half-decent overall, but the girl was damn annoying...not realistically annoying, or ""that's how it was in them times"" annoying, but plain ""I'm a Hollywood brat"" annoying.

415724,5,6301973232,"There are images in Night of the Hunter, Charles Laughton's only film as a director, that will sear themselves into your brain and haunt you the rest of your life.  That's not hyperbole; this film is simply that potent.
Nothing about Night of the Hunter is ""realistic"" or even plausible - not the plot, not the dialogue, not the behavior of the child characters, not the photography.  Yet, Night of the Hunter transcends realism utterly to do something far more challenging than merely create a simulacrum of reality.  It creates a waking dream - a vivid hallucination of fearsome beasts, tragic heroines, children in peril, and ultimate redemption.  It succeeds as a modern fairy tale in the darkest tradition of the brothers Grimm. Even comparisons to German expressionist cinema of the silent era (apt though they are) diminish the singular, elemental power of this film.  The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu are stunning, but it's hard to imagine either of them getting under the skin in quite the same way.
The plot centers on the evil machinations of Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), a murderous, psychotic ""preacher"" who does time with bank-robber Ben Harper (Peter Graves), father of two young children (Billy Chapin - brother of Father Knows Best star Lauren, and Sally Jane Bruce).  Before being taken away by the police, Harper hid the money he stole and swore his children to secrecy about its location. No one else - not even their mother Willa (wonderfully played by Shelley Winters) - knows where the money is hidden.  But after Ben Harper is hanged for the murder of two bank guards killed during the robbery, Harry Powell makes it his business to find out.  Thus begins a cinematic odyssey like no other, filled with stark symbolism and eerie imagery.
Perhaps the most unsettling image is the celebrated shot of Willa's corpse in the river, strapped into a car, her hair billowing out in the water like the aquatic plants that surround her.  It is one of the strongest images in all cinema - comparable to the baby carriage racing down the Odessa steps in Battleship Potemkin, or the eyeglasses landing on the snow-covered battlefield of Dr. Zhivago.
The central sequence is a boat journey that the children take down-river in an attempt to escape the evil preacher.  Though obviously filmed on a sound stage and filled with incongruous and frankly theatrical moments, the overall effect is nearly overwhelming in the way it evokes childhood fears of abandonment and pursuit.  Every time I see it, I fall completely under its spell.
Stanley Cortez's breathtaking black-and-white cinematography is complemented by Walter Schumann's atmospheric score.  There is a moment during the river journey when Pearl (the little girl) begins singing a children's lullaby.  The orchestra swells and turns the song into a dreamy, meditative piece of night music - filled with dread, sadness, and awe.  It's not at all realistic, but if that scene doesn't give you chills, then you're just made of stone.
It is fitting that Lillian Gish plays the children's savior, the elderly Mrs. Cooper - a righteous woman with a steely constitution.  Gish was there for the birth of cinema itself.  Her presence in Night of the Hunter is like seal of approval, a testimony to this film's enduring status as a classic.
My only reservation with this otherwise superb DVD is the warning at the beginning that ""This film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit your TV"".  Either that's flatly untrue (as Night of the Hunter looks perfectly at home in 4:3), or MGM has cheated us by not giving a true American classic its due.",1001635200,213,3650,4.907317073170732
415725,5,6301973232,"Directed by Charles Laughton from a screenplay by James Agee, ""Night of the Hunter"" was hated by critics and bombed at the box office when it was released in 1955.  Now, however, it is considered a classic masterpiece, one which Roger Ebert calls ""the greatest of all American films.""  Starring Robert Mitchum as a psychopathic preacher in relentless pursuit of two children who possess their dead father's stolen fortune, the suspense starts in the very first frame as Lillian Gish, cast as an elderly woman who later shelters the children, reads prophetic biblical verses aloud.  This sets the weirdly expressionistic tone of the film, which takes place in a small town on a riverbank some time during the depression.  Shelly Winters is cast as the young widow whose husband has just been hanged for murder. As the trusting mother of the two children Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce, she soon becomes one of the reverend's many victims. There's a bit of comic relief introduced with a nosey neighbor who hasn't a clue about how treacherous Mitchum really is; but otherwise, the tension is almost unbearable throughout.
Filmed in black and white, the cinematography by Stanley Cortez is nothing short of brilliant. He knew just when to use natural elements such as frogs and owls to set the scenes.  And his shots of Mitchum's shadow falling across the wall of the children's bedroom was great, as was his shot of the elderly Gish in a pose evocative of Whistler's Mother.  The acting was excellent and I'm shocked that there was not even one nomination for an award of any kind.  I watched this video in a kind of daze of my own as the tension and suspense kept mounting.  And just when I thought I knew where the story was going, there would be another twist.  It seemed to take realism and stretch it to its extreme, and the feeling I had throughout was that of a rubber band about to pop. It's rare I get so involved in watching a video.  One thing I know for sure is that I will never forget this film.  Highly recommended.  But be prepared to be scared.",996364800,21,2062,4.634615384615385

The terror of the situation derives from their total helplessness as Robert Mitchum, expertly preying on their mother's weaknesses, insinuates himself into their home.  Shelley Winter's fate provides one of the most extraordinary shots I have ever seen in a film. Ultimately, the children are forced to flee their home and their nightmarish journey down river is very well shot.  Throughout the film, the children are at the mercy of their surroundings.

Expressionism vs. naturalism, fable vs. social commentary, dream vs. reality, convention vs. experiment. Yet somehow these disparate elements not only hold together, they soar together, into film making heights. I'm almost tempted to say miraculously so, because on paper such opposing styles would seem to resist any kind of meaningful synthesis. Yet there it is, on the screen, an almost seamless work of movie-making art. After 61 reviews - a testament to Hunter's mesmerizing effect - there is little left to say. Except to observe that if the film's brain is Director Laughton, and its eyes Stanley Cortez, then its heart (which is considerable) comes from screen writer James Agee. Literary conscience of the Great Depression, Agee makes of this modern day fairy tale a moving tribute to children of all times who have had to struggle against forces so much bigger and more knowing than themselves. Cast adrift in an alien world, they can only hope for the best, which amounts to trusting in the presence somewhere of a benevolent force to protect them. John and Pearl are lucky. Other children as Agee well knew are not so lucky. In an odd way, this is the conscionable movie about spiritual compassion that Hollywood always wanted to make, but instead could only have been made by accident.

415729,5,6301973232,"This exceptional, unique classic film, the sole directorial effort by Charles Laughton, presents the world from a child's perspective and as a child's worst nightmare.  A menacing, psycopathic adult has all the other adults around him fooled as to his true nature....with only he AND the child knowing what he really is and what he is capable of....and he is after the child (children).
Many have remarked on the German expressionist cinema influence on the the look of the film.  To me, Laughton and his cinematographer Stanley Cortez created the exaggerations and frights of childhood...of the fairy tale and the Boogie Man and the things that go bump in the night.  It has a very real/unreal texture to all of it.  Graphic and then dreamlike.
Mitchum's performance treads a thin line between reality and nightmare as well, almost bordering on self-parody, he exaggerates just enough to be likewise frightenly real yet unreal. Look at the scene in the cellar with his stentorian overboard ""Git down those stairs thar"" followed by his truly frightening Abraham-like threat to John then hilarity and fright mixed at the revelation of the doll and the children's escape.  It is a masterfully complex performance throughout.  Arguably Mitchum's best.
All the adults fail John and his little sister Pearl and they take to the river for escape eventually  to be pulled from the rushes and saved by a truly good person, Lillian Gish, who's faith isn't of the loud and demonstrable kind, but of the deep and practical and living kind.  She's marvelous.
The film has a multitude of unforgettable scenes and moments.  My personal favorites:  Mitchum waist deep in water watching the children just slipping out of his grasp and howling like a banshee in rage and frustration;  John seeing the silhouette of Mitchum riding across the horizon singing ""Leaning"" and plainively wondering ""Don't he never sleep?"";  the look on Mitchum's face when staring down the wrong end of Gish's 12 guage shotgun; and, of course, who will ever forget Shelley Winters, trussed up with a long black line under her jaw ""like a second mouth"" in the car with her hair weaving gently with the river seagrass.
Mesmermizing, hypnotic, moody, with unexpected humor and some observations as to religion, both that feigned and used to deceive and debase, and that truly felt and practiced as deep spiritual solace.  Simply a great movie.  A Classic.",991180800,3,2412,5.012531328320802
415730,5,6301973232,"Charles Laughton unfortunately only directed one film, but what a brilliant one it turned out to be! A gothic film-noir classic infused with a wicked sense of understated black humor.
The storyline is quite simple; centered around the quest for the loot of a bank-robbery gone wrong, but the real high-point of this film is Robert Mitchum.
Mitchum's portrayal of a sexually frustrated, sadistic, murderous conman, that tries to uncover the whereabouts of 10.000 $ by presenting himself as a god-fearing preacher-man, is one of the most sinister and menacing displays of criminally insane, psychopatic behaviour ever captured on film.
Laughton's direction and Stanley Cortez's cinematography, especially in the underwater, where the dead body of Shelly Winters is found strapped to her car, and in the nightmare-ish, dream-like sequense, where Mitchum stalks the river-bound children, creates scenes that has forever etched themselves in my ""movie-memory"".

It may be awful for a psychopath to try and cut children's throats for ......... in cash, but it is also darkly comical (don't miss Peter Graves within the first fifteen minutes). This movie was also frank in its sexual subject matter (Mitchum's best line: ""Alright, you can come to bed now."") during its initial release.

415775,5,6301973232,"First of all, loving this movie is a continuing process.  When I first saw it, I did not get it at all.  I was expecting some kind of moderately spooky film about a man who stalks kids.  The first half was like that, but by the second half it turned into a gothic, dreamlike movie with a song and a happy ending.  I was very unsatisfied.  But when I went to sleep that night, that very happy ending worked in reverse; it actually scared me.  It gave me the same kind of scare a messed-up dream can give you.  The kind of nightmare where everything is horrible and frightening, and then suddenly, it's bright and happy and little girls are playing hop-scotch.  The movie really works on your brain in a way no other movie has (and probably will).
The music is a big contribution to the eerie feeling you get when watching this.  It is very beautiful, much more than most soundtracks were back in the 50s.  And when the little girl breaks out into song in the canoe, man, that is one of the most surreal, spooky scenes ever made.
The kid actors add to the horror.  They give cold stares throughout the movie, not cutesy looks you'd expect.  Robert Mitchum is excellent; his performance gives me the creeps just thinking about it.  Shelley Winters is very, very interesting.
So if you truly want a scare, buy Night of the Hunter, turn down the lights in your living room, and watch this at midnight.  Actually, I need to try doing that.....",980812800,5,1437,4.414448669201521

415778,5,6301973232,"Secondo me Laughton ha deciso di non fare altri film non tanto perch disturbato dalle tiepide accoglienze al suo capolavoro - per quanto ho capito dell'uomo, non gliene poteva importare di meno del giudizio degli altri - ma perch comprese che migliorarsi dopo un esordio alla regia come ""The night of the hunter"" (1955) sarebbe stato quasi impossibile. La storia di John e Pearl Harper - tratta da un libro di medio valore di Grubb uscito un paio di anni prima -  questa: loro padre uccide per rubare 10.000 dollari, che riesce a consegnare - senza essere visto da altri, e imponendo loro il giuramento di mantenere il segreto - ai piccoli figli prima di essere arrestato. In carcere incontra il sedicente reverendo Powell (un impressionante Robert Mitchum), una specie di psicopatico, che pretende di parlare con Dio ma che - afflitto da un odio morboso per le donne (che giudica tutte immorali) - non esita a sedurre vedove e mature zitelle per ucciderle e derubarle. Powell non riesce a farsi dire dove sono nascosti i soldi ma capisce che i bambini ne sanno qualcosa; raggiunge quindi la citadina dove vivono gli Harper. Forte del credito che perbenismo pi ottuso accorda ai suoi abiti da pastore e della ingenuit della vedova (Shelley Winters), la sposa e pretende di essere il nuovo padre dei bambini solo per tormentarli e farsi rivelare dove sono i soldi. Appena la donna scopre le reali intenzioni di Powell, egli la uccide ma i bambini riescono a scappare su una barchetta portata dalla corrente. Vengono poi accolti dalla signora Cooper (Lilian Gish), una donna che alleva marmocchi abbandonati. Powell riesce a rintracciare i bambini e tenta un assalto alla casa della Cooper. Ma questa ha idee chiare e abbastanza determinazione per sconfiggerlo. Questa la storia. Laughton - caricandola di significati profondi, anche al di l del testo di Grubb - la fa raccontare dalla Cooper, che a sua volta l'ha udita dai bambini: Questa struttura di ""racconto raccontato"" - dichiarata fin dalla prima sequenza, ma che spesso sfugge allo spettatore disattento -  motivo del particolare stile narrativo del film, visto appunto con gli occhi dei bambini. Il film  ricco di simboli e di rinvii, tutti assolutamente rigorosi, che anche se non colti immediatamente imprimono una forte coerenza alla narrazione e al tempo stesso ne danno l'incanto di una fiaba. La visione del rapporto tra bambini e adulti  fondamentale: i piccoli, in pratica, non vengono mai ascoltati. E tra le donne, solo la Cooper (eterna madre di figli non suoi) piace al regista (invero un noto misogino...), testarda e coraggiosa, sbrigativa ma mai insensibile: l'unico personaggio femminile, comunque, che non abbocca alle seduzioni del ""reverendo"". La storia  anche quella della formazione di una coscienza in John (Pearl  davvero ancora troppo piccolina): questi arriverebbe a farsi uccidere per rispettare il segreto del padre, ma alla fine - quando Powell, padre fasullo, viene arrestato allo stesso modo di quello vero - gli butta addosso i soldi che non vuole pi avere: il padre ha ucciso, per quei soldi, ed  stato ucciso; la madre a sua volta  stata assassinata per quei soldi; ora anche Powell verr condannato. John, gettandole banconote e - circostanza importante - rifiutandosi di accusare Powell durante il giudizio che comunque lo condanner, esce da questa storia di adulti, fatta solo di morte e brama di denaro, e ci regala la speranza di una nuova possibilit di vita. Un film meraviglioso, perch diretto con mano sicura ma con grande ricchezza di idee e di poesia, che voleva colpire lo spettatore e - come disse lo stesso Laughton - riportarlo, dall'essere sprofondato in poltrona a mangiucchiare popcorn e dolcetti, in posizione eretta. Attori bravissimi, ma certo le espressioni di Mitchum sono straordinarie: a volte si dubita che Powell creda davvero a ci che dice! La colonna sonora (di Walter Schumann)  efficacissima, e c' forte coerenza tra i collegamenti tra le situazioni narrative e i rimandi del commento musicale. Infine, va ricordata la straordinaria fotografia in b/n di Stanley Cortez: la luce in questo film recita una parte importante al pari degli attori (il tema del contrasto tra luce ed ombra  una delle linee portanti del film), ma oltre alle tante sequenze nelle quali i giochi d'ombra sono essenziali a comprendere le situazioni, non pu essere dimenticata la meravigliosa sequenza della fuga notturna sul fiume: l'acqua sembra viva, in una magia di riflessi e ombre profonde, quasi una grande madre capace finalmente di proteggere.",976492800,3,4544,5.087248322147651

Likewise a scene where Mitchum's character is seen in sillouette while he's singing ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" is equally good.  One true standout is where Mitchum sits outside a home where the children are staying and sings, while an elderly woman sits inside cradling a shotgun waiting for him, and then they begin to sing a duet of the song - sort of the hunter/hunted finding harmony together.

The two films certainly resemble one  another, with their use of deep-focus photography, the luscious shadows,  and even the use, in both films, of an ""old-fashioned"" iris shot.  We of course tend to praise the director's vision in films as  idiosyncratic as The Magnificent Ambersons and Night of the Hunter, but the  common link of Stanley Cortez shows just how much is owed to the cameraman.",956275200,,645,5.028301886792453
415798,1,6301973232,"After reading the good reviews on this page I thought I'd check out this movie only to be disappointed by what I watched.
I found the acting to be poor, with barely believable characters. The plot was thin with sickeningly  moralistic overtones.
This is by far the worst film I have seen in a long  time.
A waste of time and money (just my opinion folks!)",949622400,14,355,4.363636363636363
415799,5,6301973232,"If you love -- really love -- movies, you will find The Night of The Hunter bewitching.  It transmutes from a devilish terror/suspense character study (Robert Mitchum is bone-chilling as the Preacher) into a  pseudo-fantasmagoric religious fable.  The explicit nature of the sexual  tension and secrets of these characters, from Shelley Winters' terrifying  transformation, to the images of abuse, is really mind-blowing, given the  date of this film's initial release.  And too, the dreamy, intoxicating  river ride, shared by the two luminous and spell-binding children, evokes  both German fairy tales and Greek tragedy.  Lillian Gish arrives not a  moment too soon, and again transforms this movie into a redemptive tale of  hope and resilience.  Her haven for the misbegotten children of the world  transforms them, and then us, into believers.  Listen for the creepy hymn  -- which becomes a battle of will between Mitchum and Gish.  Haunting and  classic.",945734400,24,962,5.342281879194631
415800,4,6301973232,"This is a very special film, in that it was the only one to be directed by Charles Laughton. Very Germanic in it's creepy photography, the movie has much symbolism and it very well acted. I can see why it wasn't a success in 1955, it being ahead of its time.  It plays like a fairy tale and a thriller all at once. I liked the old uncle played by James Gleason, Evelyn Varden is an amusing pain as Icey Spoon and Mitchum is genuine and convincing as the psychotic 'preacher'. I wasn't crazy about the artificial set where Ruby goes to find love. I felt Lillian Gish gave the best performance in the film. Creepy is the scene where the children's mother (Shelley Winters) is shown beneath the water, drowned by Mitchum. My favorite part is where the kids are sleeping in the hayloft and John wakes up in the wee hours and sees Powell's sillouette riding a horse singing ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" - he remarks to himself in horrific disbelief ""Don't he ever sleep?"" The music is hauntingly realized although the scene where Pearl sings a song in the rowboat with John is ridiculous - a child her age wouldn't sing such lyrics.",943833600,6,1132,4.468599033816425
415841,5,6301973232,"Everybody associated with this movie did his part perfectly.

Davis Grubb wrote a unique, beautiful book.

Charles Laughton must have realized that with such a book, you can't just take the story and put it willy-nilly  on screen -- at least if you want the result to be any good. The  directing/screen play/cinematography is perfect, catching the spirit of the  original work, or maybe even improving upon it.

Robert Mitchum played his  part with chilling accuracy; like a great actor can, he made a character on  paper come alive on the screen. The same was done by Lillian Gish, Shelley  Winters, and Billy Chapin with Rachel, Willa (?), and John,  respectively.

As somebody else pointed out, the choice of black and white  for this film was an inspiration.

In other words, it's that rarety of  Hollywood: a good book transferred to the screen without losing anything,  and maybe even gaining something. The result is a masterpiece. Watch it.",937785600,8,948,4.9113924050632916

If you watch as if you are the children, then you too will be  scared.  The shot of Shelly Winters in the lake has always run chills up my  back.
Unfortunately, this is not the type of movie that TODAY'S  generation will find exciting...there are no ""special effects""  and you have to really THINK about the story instead of having it handed to  you on a platter.  I notice that all three bad reviews of this film are  from the same person...odd, don't you think???

415844,5,6301973232,"A sure sign of a great movie is that it polarizes opinion: people either love it or hate it - few are ambiguous with their opinions. That seems to be the case with ""Night of the Hunter"". I know people who think  that ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"" are  ""boring"" and ""cliched"". The problem is that these were  movies that inspired the generations of movie makers that followed.  ""Night of the hunter"" is  not a film to be taken literally. Its narrative is no match for its visual  power...but what visual power! I'll never forget the image of the children  watching the preacher on his mule, silhouetted against the horizon, singing  that bizarre religious song as he closes in upon his prey. Magical!  Poetic, even! A wonderful film, to be seen more than once!

7819787,1,6301973232,"Wow, and I thought ""Casablanca"" was overrated!
This one is not so famous as they Humphrey Bogart film but still the role of Robert Mitchum is still very iconic, the evil preacher with his knuckles tattooed with the words ""love"" and ""hate"".
So here we have a man who is said to have killed 25 widows but he's unable to take a ragdoll off a five year old girl! And no matter where those kids hide or even if they go to another town, Robert magically appears there, but again, he's unable to outsmart these two kids and get the money (the cash he's after is inside the doll).
I can understand that the FX back in the day look laughable now (the movie starts with a long shot of Mr. Mitchum driving against a very fake background), but the pace of this movie is just comical! One example: Robert meets a woman, and just two scenes laterthey are getting married! Wait, there's more: One scene later and he's already abusing his wife in their honeymoon night, revealing his truth self as  crazy preacher! Two minutes later he's smacking the woman! And still, when her kids tell her that his ""new father"" is abusing them, she does not believe them! One WTF after another.

Laughton was a genius (a word I almost never use) and the film is a masterpiece (another word I almost never use). The casting and performances are perfect, as are the photography and production design and editing, and, and, and...

I'm not going to give a synopsis, because, first, spoiler and because it is such a unique film it sort of defies description. It must be experienced to be understood.

The fact that Laughton never made another film because Night of the Hunter didn't succeed commercially in its day (because the studio didn't promote it properly) adds poignance to the history of this remarkable film.
