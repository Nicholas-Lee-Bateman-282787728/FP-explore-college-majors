8049308,5,B0007NH2OW,I came from that area and was intrigued my whole childhood and adult life with that mystery.  I loved that someone took an interest to do this investigative DVD.,1465171200,,161,4.551724137931035
8049309,4,B0007NH2OW,"A superb and artful documentary, a haunting and entertaining (and very informative) presentation of a very haunting mystery.

I wish all true crime documentaries could be done with this much skill and ""soul.""",1155945600,5,208,5.303030303030303
8049310,5,B0007NH2OW,"""Dusk and Shadow""  is largely based on my book ""Twilight of Innocence: the Disappearance of Beverly Potts"", published by the Kent State University Press in April, 2005.  It represents my second colaboration with Mark Wade Stone of Storytellers Media Group. (See my book ""In the Wake of the Butcher: Cleveland's Torso Murders"" and Storyteller's Video ""The Fourteenth Victim: Eliot Ness and the Torso Murders"".)

  Beverly Potts is Cleveland's most famous missing child.  She disappeared on August 24, 1951, and for a variety of reasons, she has become a Cleveland legend--the yardstick by which all other child murders and/or abductions are measured.  Because of my relationship with Mark and Storytellers, it would be inappropriate for me to review ""Dusk and Shadow"" as if I were a disinterested third party.  It does a wonderful job, however, of capturing the sheer heart break and sadness--not to metion, the utter mystery--that still surrounds this fifty-plus year old case.  It also deals with the pain inflicted on the Potts family by the intense media coverage. The documentary has been shown twice on local PBS and has garnered good reviews and high ratings both times. In short, I am very proud to have this documentary offered as a companion piece to my book ""Twilight of Innocence: the Disappearance of Beverly Potts"". My colaboration with Storytellers Media Group has been both enjoyable and productive.  If only I could write  books as quickly as Mark can produce documentaries!!",1121644800,7,1491,5.170833333333333
