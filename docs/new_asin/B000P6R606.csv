8189297,2,B000P6R606,"The title means in infantile phonetic french : <Nos voisins d en dessous /Our neighbors from below> (Nippon).The film-makers wanted to laugh of Japanese people by doing Candid Camera-like gags and pranks (often disgustingly gross) in totally public spaces like in the middle (asphalt) of the Japanese equivalent of Trafalgar Square; the reverse is happening, the Japanese come out as honorable, well-educated, highly disciplined, organized and polite; and EXTREMELY PATIENT towards imbecile Canadian tourists! Indeed the film-makers seem ridiculous in comparison and I pity them. Many gags are not funny, in fact they consist of insulting behavior for the Japanese (I would like the movie to be shorter = a painful waste of time watching it - would like to hide instead of seeing it) lasting much too long. The movie makers should be ashamed. They probably toured for free Japan (with the movie money) and made the (bad) movie on the side with poor video illegally hidden cameras and sub-optimal sound. I am not biased : I am a north american Caucasian coming from Quebec province like the movie makers and am ashamed of that. A disgrace for us Quebecois. Makes us look like <des maudits epais> (Morons). My apologies to the Japanese people if the movie makers have not done already.",1311811200,,1283,5.028169014084507
