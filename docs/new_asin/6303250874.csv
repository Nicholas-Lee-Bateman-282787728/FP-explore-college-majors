606387,5,6303250874,"I found this tape at my local library. I've tried others that were too fast, too challenging & too boring. I though I'd never learn to like yoga. After checking it out a few times, I'd found I was adicted & had to get my own copy. It's a great stress reliever, it just stretches away the day's tenison. There is a morning & evening routine so you just do a few minutes morning & night. There's even a meditation at the end. Dixie's video is challenging, yet not too difficult. Try it & you'll love it too. I reccomend this to everyone who has never done yoga, but has always wanted to learn.

606389,5,6303250874,"Back pain and headache became a constant for me following an accident back in 1981. Many painful years and far too many pain pills later, I broke down and bought a yoga tape because so many people advised me to try yoga for relief. That wonderful day was over 6 years ago, and I have not missed ONE day doing yoga since then. Dixie's tape introduced me to positions gradually and allowed me to ease into getting the full benefits from what yoga has to offer. Her easy going nature and sense of humor made me relax and enjoy each session. The tape is broken down into two 30 minute segments - day yoga and night time yoga. The time frames make it possible to fit into your daily schedule and you don't have to be a human pretzel to achieve the positions done in this tape. I've purchased this tape as a gift for several friends and have been thanked MANY times over for doing so. You won't be disappointed with this one!

606390,5,6303250874,"I can't deal with the irritating and pretentious ''gurus'' on other tapes, so this tape is perfect for me. The twenty minute morning workout features exercises for both strength and flexibility, the evening segment is primarily stretching and relaxation. Twenty minutes doesn't sound like very long, but these poses are challenging. Dixie's unassuming demeanor is so fun... it's like working out with your cool aunt who is visiting from the south. I love it.",1006214400,8,458,5.202702702702703
606391,5,6303250874,"This video is great.  I was extremely out of shape when I started this video.  I was looking to lose weight so I started with the Firm workout.  Bad move.  Not ready!  I tried this video for 1 month, then I moved into a video called Belly Dance for Beginners for 1 month.  Another awesome video.  Then I moved into Kathy Smith Latin Rhthym workout for a month (2 weeks on the 20 minute routine and 2 weeks on the 40 minute routine).  THEN, I went back to the Firm video. I have since lost 15 pounds.  I say all this because this is a wonderful video to use and Yoga is a great way to begin to prepare your body for heavier types of exercise if you are very flabby and out of shape or if you have never really exercised in your life. Dixie Carter makes it so wonderful and relaxing all while you are beginning to tone and stretch your muscles.",984009600,11,842,4.085365853658536
606392,4,6303250874,"Ms. Carter's first ""Unworkout"" video is a great all-over intense workout.  This tape is perfect for people who don't have a whole hour or  just want to focus on certain areas. Both the morning and evening workouts  are 20 minutes each.
The morning is a series of ""silken  movements"", and  like Ms. Carter, I love the ""arrow""  movement.  The side bends and forward bending twists are challenging, but  if you keep practicing you eventually gain control. The ""warrior""  pose is difficult at first, but gradually, it becomes fun to do.  Ms.  Carter's  sense of humour, dedication, and belief in what she's practicing  is something that makes you want to continue your practice.  I truly feel  awake once I've finished doing these series of movements and  breathings.
The evening section is a series of leg stretches and is  something I look forward to doing every evening. I must tell you, though,  if you attempt the ""rabbit"" pose, make sure you're flexible  enough to do it.  I can honestly admit that's one pose I avoid, but the  rest of the workout, is truly ""sensational"".  I  really do sleep  much better because of this workout.
The bonus relaxation section is also  wonderful if you've had a stressful day at the office (as I'm prone to have  often).  I always lay my head on a  pillow while Ms. Carter leads me  through the process.
""Unworkout II"" is one of the tapes I  alternate, but as mentioned earlier, I always do the evening  portion
every day.  I alternate this with Ms. Carter's first tape, Bryan  Kest's Power Yoga 1, and Jane Fonda's Yoga tape.",966211200,23,1561,4.684014869888476
606393,5,6303250874,"Dixie makes the workout enjoyable enough that you forget you are truly workingout!  I have tried other programs and stoped very soon after.  Here I look forward to each workout, even if it means before bed on those really  busy days.  As with everyone else, I feel her voice and humor are a bonus  to the workout.",958608000,7,313,4.421052631578948
606394,5,6303250874,"Just received Dixie's yoga video and it exceeded my expectations.  Her voice is soothing, and she gently guides you through the yoga positions.  My 5 year old wanted to join in and was able to go through the entire video  with me, so it held her attention as well.  Very soothing and effective.  Loved the southern wit and charm.",954806400,7,329,4.508474576271187

7841736,4,6303250874,"For me the exercises were too difficult. I love Dixie Carter, but wasn't really thrilled with some of the philosophies she presented, but I guess that's a part of yoga. However, I do give it 4 stars for the beautiful background setting. Just looking at the beauty of it makes me feel somewhat relaxed, but that's just me.",1424304000,,321,4.551724137931035

7841739,4,6303250874,"I had been doing this Yoga vhs for many years. It gives you more energy and has kept my bones stonger. When my vhs tape broke I was so happy to find it on your site. I was afraid since she had passed on I woulden't find it.
I was introduced to it by a friiend who has MS and said it was a help to her to move better but not hurt her. I have told many of my friends they have to have this tape. I so wish it was available in DVD as my vhs will only last so long. Great way to stay healthy.",1392422400,,488,3.5277777777777777

7841742,5,6303250874,I bought this to replace one that I had worn out. I love this video and wish it was available on DVD. I do the night time stretches the most and it really does help me sleep better. I do not do any other yoga so I am not sure how it compares but I sure enjoy it. Dixie is great too!,1313020800,,282,3.564516129032258
7841743,3,6303250874,"Well, watching this ""not so young"" actress (55 at the time, may she RIP) perform intense Yoga Moves with such ease, was at the least another great inspiration for me to embrace Yoga into my life for good!

Why only 3 stars? She's cute and all, but a lil' too giggly for me.  I personally like to work out with a more instructional type method...with the instructor explaining and reiterating the importance of the breathing techniques, and careful placement of the feet, knees, hips etc. during the practice of each Yoga Posture.

It was nice to see her variety of cute workout attire from 1 1/2 Decades ago :-)",1283040000,,611,4.587155963302752
7841744,5,6303250874,This is an excellent workout for the beginner or intermediate level.  She is personal & witty while giving thorough instructions. Some of the postures are challenging & I have a great respect for her agility.  Her workout leaves me feeling ready to face the day & eager to return for another workout. Her cool down at the end is very relaxing.  She understood the challenges for the woman over 30.  Just wish she had more workouts available.  Thanks Dixie!,1244073600,,456,4.7215189873417724
