8574462,5,B00BV7ONHM,"This is one of my all-time favorite dramas. The story, the music, the actors - all excellent. It's the genre at it's best. The english subtitles have a few minor errors, but nothing that distracts or misleads you about the story. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1406851200,2,257,4.608695652173913
