8609794,2,B00067WSVG,"As an aspiring rockabilly player, I ordered this DVD with high hopes.. Oh Boy! was I DISSAPOINTED..
 All Mr. Weider does on the DVD is show the viewer how good and fast HE can play.. SELF-INDULGENT clap-trap.
 He makes no attempt to break down the licks like other teachers do.. ABsolutely no teaching on his part, whatsoever...
 If u actaully want to LEARN rockabilly guitar, don't buy this DVD... Complete waste..",1284940800,8,415,4.816901408450704
