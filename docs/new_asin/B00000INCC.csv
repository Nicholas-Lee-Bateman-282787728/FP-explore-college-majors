7911196,3,B00000INCC,"This is the major premise. Ida Willis (Mollie Sugden)is a strong-willed (remember Hazel?) housekeeper who gets a position with a young married couple named Robert and Angie Price (Christopher Blake and Jennifer  Lonsdale). After practically taking over the house, she learns that she is  the natural mother of the husband, having put him up for adoption way back  when. Of course she has to keep living there now to take care of her sonny  boy; but the second mother naturally has the same motivation--and the  double conflict of (a) mother living with couple and (b) two mothers as  rivals for My Boy are the two planks upon which this series seems destined  to rest.
Mollie Sugden is--well, Mollie Sugden--and for the countless  admirers of her role in ""Are You Being Served?"" she can do no  wrong. The series can, however; and while it might not be quite as  ""pedestrian"" as one critic put it, it certainly lacks the appeal  of ""Served"" and other Britcoms with characters that are equally  predictable but considerably more charming. And there, I think, is the  major problem, at least in the three opening episodes on this video. There  is nothing particularly appealling about the young couple; and the second  mother is not enough of a foil for Mollie.  But still in all, Sugden fans  will want to have this set for viewing a reviewing. And it is a good thing  to trot out at a party when all the ice has been broken and conversation is  getting on the dull side. It does, after all, have a certain goofiness that  will keep you smiling, if not laughing.
When I review the next episodes,  I will put my comments on the appropriate webpage.",941760000,5,1645,4.662020905923345
