8552926,4,B00AK51MAC,"""Either Way"" is an interesting film about two very different men working together in isolation on Iceland's road system. Their isolation causes them to rely upon each other, and their basic differences in character to turn upon each other in unintended exercises of self examination. They also spend time examining the world around, and their places in it, questioning what is right, what is good and how it affects them and their choices.
There is wonderful scenery and unexpected comic characters ( a trucker and his doxy ) that lighten the mood on occasion, while providing an amazing antithesis to their inner struggles of self-worth.",1422144000,3,638,5.085714285714285
8552927,1,B00AK51MAC,"Awful--shallow, crass, utterly pointless waste of time.  BORING!  However, if you like crude behavior and predictable, practically non-existent plots without any layers, enjoy.",1384819200,3,176,6.608695652173913
