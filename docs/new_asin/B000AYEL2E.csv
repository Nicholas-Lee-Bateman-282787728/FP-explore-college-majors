8080603,1,B000AYEL2E,"Delta Force 3. What a disapointment. Following up the trancendant Delta Force 2, this crapfest was like going out with Eva Longoria Friday night, and Rosie O'Donnell on Saturday. I have no problem with overweight people, but Rosie is just hard to look at. I think I heard that somewhere before. Anyway, Mike Norris as we all know gave us a star effort in the classic Death Ring, but in this one, he was not the same man. In Delta Force 3, he was the biggest lamest, whimpiest geek! We, Sid the Elf, are starting to think that his integral part in Death Ring was due more to the supperior writing than Mike Norris's performance.

Also, there were these Arabs who were vacilitating between their Middle eastern accents and no accent at all. Usually, this is a very good thing, but in this one it just kind of annoyed us. So, we say stay far away from this one. There was a serious lack of explosions, almost none of the goofy karate fighting we've all come to know and love in a good b, and there was even fewer tough guy lines! That doesn't sound like a good solid old-fashioned American B movie to me. End of story.",1185148800,,1115,4.360576923076923
8080604,2,B000AYEL2E,"Delta Force 3 (the actual film title is Delta Force 3: The Killing Game) was released by Cannon films in 1993. Cannon films financed the first two Delta Force films orignally with legendary B-Action producers Golan-Globus. By the time DF3 got around to being made, neither Golan or Globus were around anymore to produce. Though they are absent, the film still FEELS like a Cannon film none-the-less. Another person that hightailed for this sequel was original series star Chuck Norris. When I first found out they made a Delta Force 3, my reaction was ""How could they make a sequel without Chuck Norris?"" Well apparently he was supposed to be in it, but bowed out due to a near fatal helicoptor crash while on the set of Delta Force 2 (according to imdb). What a shame, but for some reason Cannon forged on to make a third and final film to complete the Delta Force trilogy. This time they decided to hire a bunch of young action stars (Whom many are relations to bigger name stars, including Matthew Penn, Eric Douglas, and Mike Norris). With a ""hype"" young cast (resulting in the lame tagline ""Younger & Tougher Because They Have To Be), the filmmakers set out to make an even more action packed sequel. Frankly, they failed to live up to the shere B-grade funness of the first two films. Chuck Norris has a charisma to him that makes even his worst films watchable and he has major physical talent to boot. Sorry but my original inclination was right as this film seriously misses Norris's precence. Not even seven of these younger stars that make up this new Delta Force can make up for the lack of the central force of Norris. The film itself is a typical Cannon actionier entertaining in its own B-grade right, but as a true Delta Force sequel? Bah....give me the first two any day over this.

I actually thought I would never see this little known sequel on DVD, but low and behold one day I saw it in the new section at a local DVD retailer. Thankfully Warner Home Video is getting off their lazy butts to release some of these little known B-action flicks from Cannon Films to the fans. Hey, their not art, but they entertain. Like many of the other Cannon films being released this has little special features, as in NONE. There isn't even a chapter selection option! They are in full screen as expected but the picture looks pretty good. Oh well, I'm just glade to to see thse on DVD.

NOTE: Please do not confuse this with the dreaded ""Operation Delta Force"" series of films. This is the third entry in the TRUE Delta Force series.",1124928000,8,2543,4.538126361655773
