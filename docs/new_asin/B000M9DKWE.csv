8252413,3,B000M9DKWE,"This movie features Walter Brennan, at least in the credits. His role in the film itself is rather small. While he seems pretty spry and healthy, this was made near the end of his life and I think his appearing in it was more of a courtesy to the producer perhaps, than as any intention to take part in a good film. The story itself isn't bad. Really the reason I bought it was to see what one of the supporting actors, Billy Hughes Jr., would be like. He had been a well-regarded actor in his early teens but was taken from Hollywood due to family issues. When he appeared in this film, produced by his own family members, he might have been a little annoyed that the starring role went to another actor, not him. This was his first, and really last, appearance in Hollywood after having left at age 14 and been away for a decade.

Well be that as it may, you're not likely to happen across this movie anyhow unless you can dig up a used rental VHS tape for sale as I did. It was released back in the 70's I think, so it's all the less likely you'll find one. Really, unless you're specifically curious about one of the cast members as I was, it's not the kind of movie you really have to have. It's just 'okay'.",1250035200,,1213,4.183760683760684
