5007199,2,B006N8GNSG,"we usually love barney videos but this one had a lot of repeat songs from the other dvd's we have. not fresh, new material",1381363200,,122,4.125
5007200,5,B006N8GNSG,"Around 12 months our little one became fascinated by Barney and it quickly became her favorite show to watch. I ended up renting several DVD's from the library and once we played this one, there was no turning back. She absolutely loves this DVD and never, ever gets bored with it. As with all Barney shows, it has a message and we like that this one is about cleaning up after yourself and caring for the environment and animals. I'm very glad we found this one, although we watch it so often that my husband and I find ourselves singing the songs in our heads throughout the day!",1379635200,2,581,4.388888888888889
5007201,4,B006N8GNSG,"My children picked this with another Barney DVD before ordering and when it arrived they just can't wait to watch it.  It is a very nice DVD, educational, and they love it.",1379462400,,172,4.375
5007202,5,B006N8GNSG,My grand daughter is 22 months and she loves it. She dances for hours to Barney and his friends and that makes me think that she will learn the lessons being taught too.,1378252800,,169,4.151515151515151
5007203,5,B006N8GNSG,Bought this for my 20 month old Granddaughter and she loves it! Thinks the Robot is so funny. She is a huge Barney fan. Amazon has never failed to impress! Always speedy delivery and good products.,1366329600,,197,4.5
5007204,3,B006N8GNSG,This video is just alright. My children like it as much as they like everything Barney related. It's a bit too short.,1359590400,,117,4.363636363636363
5007205,5,B006N8GNSG,"I can't remember the first time I heard the ""Clean Up"" song, but ever since it has been engrained in my brain!  I sing it all the time for my boys (3 and 5) and they are now starting to sing it themselves.  This DVD is all about having fun and cleaning up.  It shows friends working together and cleaning up afterwards in a fun way!  I know it can't just be my kids, but they are awful at helping to clean up and I am hoping this DVD registers for them how important cleaning up is and how it can be fun too.",1332374400,,508,3.855769230769231
5007206,5,B006N8GNSG,Great video to have your child learn to clean up after playing.,1481328000,,63,4.333333333333333
5007207,5,B006N8GNSG,"My daughter loves Barney. She's one and a half and has loved Barney since the first dvd she watched. We've purchased several dvds and have over 10 now. She prefers the older episodes much more than the newer ones. This is an older episode. The older ones are better in my opinion. My daughter doesn't really like the newer ones and I think because it's mostly Barney, Baby Bop, BJ, and Raz in most scenes, where as the older ones have more seens with the children, singing and playing with Barney. She enjoys this one, it's in her top 3. My husband and I sing the clean up song all the time, and it really works! She immediately cleans up her toys, and it's fun while singing the clean up song! We also sing the brushing our teeth song when she's brushing her teeth, she loves it! Barney is very educational and my daughter loves it! Simple, sweet lessons and catchy songs!",1477699200,2,873,4.395061728395062

5007217,5,B006N8GNSG,My 22 month old daughter is in love with Barney! She refuses to watch any other show and I wouldn't have it any other way honestly. Barney is an educational adventure. She's learned so many new things from watching Barney and even though they use the same songs in all of the episodes it's totally tolerable because they're cute and have dances or hand motions for her to do along with them so she stays active even while watching Barney. This DVD is a great addition to her collection. Barney and his friends learn about cleaning up after themselves. The DVD arrived in perfect condition and on time. No complaints whatsoever from this mom and definitely none from my toddler!,1423267200,3,677,4.65

5007222,5,B006N8GNSG,"Great episode of Barney that my son loves. Showed him that things needs to be cleaned up afterward. Best is that there is a song while Barney cleans, so when we sing the song when we want our son to clean & he would come clean with us. Great way of teaching him how to cleanup after himself.",1396396800,,291,4.0344827586206895
