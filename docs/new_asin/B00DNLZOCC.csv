5836672,5,B00DNLZOCC,"Trading Christmas is a delightful story of being in the right place at the right time. Two women trade homes for the Christmas season and find love in the people they meet on vacation. It's funny and touches your heart.
Lucky Christmas is for lottery players who just need one big win to change their lives. Its a story of a single mother who although the father of the child didn't hold up his end of the responsibility, she does everything in her power to give her son a good life. When she hits big in the lottery her car is stolen with the winning ticket in the glove box. It's a story of forgiveness and restores your faith in mankind. A definite must see! The case for Christmas is a movie for every child that still believe in Santa Claus. It's a charming film for the whole family. The National tree is a wonderful movie that is worth the price and one you will want to see over and over again. I recommend all of these movies!",1377216000,148,935,4.258426966292135

5836849,4,B00DNLZOCC,"Like these movies.  Acting is decent.  Stories are heart-warming but nothing exceptional.  Will watch ""Trading Christmas"" probably each year.  The lamest was ""Lucky Christmas"".  The main characters' best friend just was not believable.  Those types of friends are the ones you warn your children to stay away from.  The National Tree, teen angst with parent was interesting but the ending seemed as if they all of a sudden went Ooops, times up, we need to end this thing.  The Case for Christmas, just an overdone theme but still ok.  But they are ""feel good"" holiday flicks and that is what we need.",1481673600,2,600,4.803921568627451

In other words, there is no closed captioning!!!  So those who are deaf or hearing impaired cannot enjoy these movies.  Shame on you Hallmark Channel!  I bought another four-pack Hallmark Christmas DVD and I fear that it will be the same way.

My mom and I loved to watch these movies when we had cable.  So I decided to buy them for her for an early Christmas gift on St Nicholas day.  My mother is extremely hard of hearing and I was very disappointed when I started the National Christmas Tree to discover that these movies where are not closed caption and did not offer subtitles.  I didn't even think twice about this when I ordered them because they were captioned when we watched them on cable.  If you don't need captions these are great movies but don't buy them if you want captions/subtitles.  I don't know if Hallmark produced these DVD's or a third party.

5837015,4,B00DNLZOCC,"My husband and I have only watched one of the four movies so far, but it was cute and an enjoyable distraction, basically a typical slightly sappy movie, with no questionable material. Truly love having movies that I am able to watch with the entire family around. Of course, these aren't quite to the level of true classic movies, but all in all, what I would expect from Hallmark. They are fairly predictable with boy meets girl theme, but my picky husband still sat and watched the entire movie with me. They are a good bargain for the price.",1449532800,2,545,4.515151515151516

5837032,4,B00DNLZOCC,"I am a huge fan of Hallmark's Christmas movies so this four pack seemed like a real bargain--and it is! The National Tree doesn't get much TV play anymore, which is a shame because I love it. It mixes holiday cheer with romance and environmental protection campaigning in a way that feels good. Anything with Andrew McCarthy gets a big thumbs up from me; the rest of the cast is good, too. Trading Christmas is slightly painful to watch, but I still watch it. I love the story line for characters Emily Spengler and Ray Johnson: moving forward after loss and taking chances on love. The pain, for me, comes from characters Faith Kerrigan and Charles Johnson. I want to shut the door on Faith and not let her back in but there she is, and it's true she does have a good lesson to teach. The Case for Christmas is a sweet story about believing in Santa Claus and human goodness, about the bonds between father and daughter. Lucky Christmas also features some annoying characters but it's a great treat anyway. I'm really pleased with this set and recommend it.",1447718400,,1058,4.544502617801047

Four people's lives intersect with humorous twist of fate all wrapped up with a happy ending. Great feel good Christmas movie, this set is worth the purchase for this movie alone. Haven't watched a case for Christmas or The National Tree. lucky Christmas was just okay. It is a little cute, but not believable. The ending leaves you hanging with what seems to be mid-sentence.

5837288,5,B00DNLZOCC,"Very nice pack. it comes with two disks, 2 movies each. You be the judge of the movies; I prefer the old black and white. I do like the DVD with John Denver, which is not a part of this set. I recommend this for Hallmark/Lifetime likers. The quality of recording is good. They are very G rated. You will likely see these listed in your guide over the holidays. Trading Christmas was pretty good, as was Lucky Christmas. 'Good' in movies is very subjective; to each their own.

5837324,5,B00DNLZOCC,2 out of 4 -  were very good stories that's why I'm buying this and rating this high!!  I loved The National Tree - It's an excellent story! - The father and the son in this movie did an exceptional acting job!!  Trading Christmas is a cute story and it was very entertaining- I loved this as well!  The Case For Christmas is too much like the Miracle on 42nd Street - It doesn't need to be repeated!  Lucky Christmas - wrongly cast  - The story is ridiculous!!,1414195200,2,461,4.181818181818182
5837325,5,B00DNLZOCC,Very good,1414108800,,9,4.0
5837326,5,B00DNLZOCC,"This is an outstanding collection of Christmas, family adventure and romance.
""Trading Christmas"" was my favorite and I have watched it several times.  It was a sweet story of letting go of the past and moving on into the future for all the characters not really knowing how things will work but somehow they will and they do.
""Lucky Christmas"" was just fun to watch although there are some serious issues about how to handle things that should be brought out in an honest admittance. But then there would not be a story for a movie.  It is not always luck that brings the good things about in life and sometimes you have to wade through uncertainties to get to the good things.
""The Case for Christmas"" was really good and most enjoyable.  It was not a remake of ""Miracle on 34th Street"".  Its story was its own.  If I could find a lesson in this it would be to be who you are and defend what you believe.  At the end of the day you can rest in your own small victories.
""The National Tree"" is very adventurous.  Not only is Dad totally involved in his son's life but so is the son.  The tension seems to be driving them apart and the dad is very fearful being without him in the very near future but he has excluded any other meaningful relationships.  Driving the tree across country helped both of them to bond and a new relationship of independence for both happened.  Dad found a new meaning of his life and the son found a new understanding of himself and his father. It is not a psychological thriller just a good movie with plenty of action.
This set was a good evening or two of watching and relaxing with a cup of coffee and some cookies.",1414022400,77,1649,4.324675324675325

SECRETS CAN MESS UP.  BUT THESE SECRETS TURN OUT FOR THE BEST AND ARE FUNNY,
UNPREDICTABLE, AND JUST UNBELIEVABLE IN THEIR WRITING.  REALLY LIKE IT.
THE NATIONAL TREE SHOWS THE LOVE OF A FATHER AND SON THROUGH TRYING TIMES,
AND BEING ABLE TO SHOW FORGIVENESS FOR UNEXPECTED THINGS.
THE CASE FOR CHRISTMAS JUST GIVES YOU EVEN MORE EVIDENCE THAT THEIR TRULY IS
A SANTA CLAUS, IF ONLY IN YOUR HEART.

5837477,5,B00DNLZOCC,"Living temporarily in the Middle East for my THIRD Christmas, I knew I would a "" little more Christmas"" here.  Christmas- themed movies are hard to find, and if, supposedly, it's a ""Christmas Movie"", it' more likely to be ""Diehard.""

So, after watching many of the Hallmark originals in the USA in November and early December, I knew they were for me!  The movies are sweet, but not silly. Many contain the theme of unexpected love of the  romantic type, or just plain ""love you neighbor as yourself.""

Mostly, they remind us that Christmas can be a time of unexpected kindnesses, little ""miracles"", and a time to dream that the spirit of Christmas really CAN exist 365 days of the year.

Hallmark delivers the best type of presents for ""The Most Wonderful Time of The Year."" ( This movie stars Henry Winkler!)",1388188800,,810,4.669014084507042

8595149,5,B00DNLZOCC,"Great DVD ! I love Christmas movies, watch them all year long. All 4 of these movies I loved ! Found all of them to be delightful and entertaining. Hallmark knows how to do Christmas movies. I love the Christmas collections with more than 1 movie on a disc. These have 2 movies on one disc (2 discs total). I hope they keep making the 4 movie Christmas collections !",1525305600,,366,4.242857142857143
