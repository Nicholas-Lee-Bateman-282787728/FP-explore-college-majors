6414782,1,B00KCNBAP4,What a complete waste of time and absolute nonsense!  There's even a supposed court scene in which they are clearly using a bed head as the railing!  The acting is really bad and you'll be lucky if you don't fall asleep halfway through.  I wouldn't even call it amateur it's that horrible.

6414784,1,B00KCNBAP4,"This film is sheer nonsense. It would appeal only to those people who buy into the so called wisdom of a delusional narcissistic individual who would have the weak minded believe that he was some kind of prophetic messiah.
it does however, to some degree, accurately portray the pitfalls of joining such groups.
as someone I knew once commented, they're all gods in the making (in their little minds).
in other words, these are the beginning of cults; most are benign and usually disband and fall apart when everyone comes to their senses, get bored with the infighting, egos and foolishness, but some are truly dangerous like Chas. Manson and as they say, the rest is history (tragically).

I never finished the film, it takes itself too seriously like the Crowley himself and just got more and more boring and ridiculous as it went on and on and on ad infinitum. truly tedious.",1422748800,3,879,4.745098039215686

The color balance and lighting change between shots in the same scene, let alone from scene to scene. Crowley's deathbed scene was filmed near an airport, the sound of modern jet aircraft can clearly be heard several times ... Crowley died in 1947, so of course there were no jets. Actors' eyes in close-up reading three lines from cue cards they couldn't bother to memorize. Anachronistic props. I could go on, but why?

The spin wasn't a negative one about him, but puts Crowley into a misunderstood light as he rebuts his detractors in this piece.  The film is quirky, but also attempts to give some magical tone in the way its filmed.  I agree that the delivery of the scripts could have been delivered with more enthusiasm at times and less rushed in other moments.  Its not worth not seeing, and its not as bad as other reviewers have stated.  As dramatic interpretations go, its par for the course, but since it didn't subtract from my understanding of Crowley and actually added to it, I awarded this 3 stars.",1469145600,3,694,4.609756097560975

I really wanted to like this film because of the subject so I was quite disappointed, most fell to the performances of the actors which are forced, recited lines without emotion or character.

The effects and soundtrack in ""Aleister Crowley: Legend Of The Beast"" is basic and expected effects for a film on this budget which was low. The special effects are equal to cable television aspects on the cheaper side with the soundtrack offering a mediocre, clich atmosphere that seems to command more of a wearied effect than the desired dramatics that the director hoped for.

8657620,1,B00KCNBAP4,"So, my wife watched this with me.  She knows nothing about Crowley.  I know a lot (for a layman).  I read my first book about Aleister Crowley within three months of turning 18 (I am now 50), sitting in the college library during lunchtime, skipping lunch and hiding the book when I was finished with the day's reading so nobody would check it out till I finished it.  I quickly followed with two more, and have read about him and watched documentaries ever since.

Here's the thing:  If you know the Crowley story, this movie will only make you angry because of the liberties it takes.  While it gets many of the large events right, those events are surrounded by such ahistorical, anachronistic, politically correct nonsense, and on the other hand are never explained or put into context, that the informed viewer can only laugh disrespectfully.

If you don't know the Crowley story (like my wife), you will wonder why you watched this and what you were supposed to get out of it.  It literally provides no light on the life of the man.

I was constantly stopping the film to explain to my wife what a certain scene meant, or why it didn't happen the way it was portrayed in this film, or even, on occasion, to wonder what the Devil (no pun intended) was going on, myself.

I have been pretty lucky in watching films on Amazon Prime in that I have not yet run into a film that has absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever.  Virtually everything is fine as far as it goes.  This may be the first film I have watched that I literally found no value in.  The story of a man's life does not need updating for the current politically correct world.  If this movie was intended to be history, it failed on a massive scale.  If it was supposed to be dramatized history, then it is more drama than history.  If it was meant to be politically correct propaganda... well, you may have something there.

Acting?  Bad.  Dialogue?  Both stilted and at points, anachronistic.  Fidelity to facts?  Think: The O.J. Simpson trial.",1529020800,,2015,4.5515320334261835

Crowley's career has all the ingredients for a ripping yarn, but this attempt seems cursed from start to finish.",1477094400,,264,4.888888888888889
