To say that the accent could be influence by Nahuatl denotes certain ignorance on the the Aztec's tongue because if anything Nahuatl has a very short-soft sound and it doesn't have the ""cantadito"" that the characters on the film use. Victor Parra is not shown as an American-Caucasian stereotype (a gringo) but as a ""pocho"" meaning a Mexican-American which may explain his heavy accent. Pocho is a pejorative name given to the children born in the U.S. from Mexican parents. They're known for having an accent when they speak in Spanish and sometimes in English although this is rarely the case today. Obviously the production values of Campeon sin Corona aren't nearly as abundant as some American films from the same period could have had. I do not think that Alejandro Galindo had the money to move the production to New York and shoot at the Garden with ""real"" American spectators and boxers. Of course in Mexico the audience of a movie like this could not care less about such minor details. The point is to show the truculent life o a Mexico City boxer (David Silva) who despite the fact that he makes it big, has somewhat of an inferiority complex towards Americans and American culture. This is shown on the film repeatedly when he refuses to smoke American cigars, gets very annoyed when he his opponent speaks in English while fighting , goes ballistic for just ""being"" on New York on a boxing tour, and openly says to a radio interviewer in New York that he likes more Mexico than the U.S. In the battle against his complex he has let down everybody from his manager (usually a villain character Carlos Lopez Moctezuma), his friends, his mother and girlfriend (the always beautiful Amanda del Llano). And yet despite his own temper he gets to beat on the ring every opponent he faces either in Mexico or the U.S. including a rival from the Philippines, an Afro-American and of course the revenge against ""pocho"" boxer who defeated Silva's character Kid Terranova at the beginning of the movie. At the end of the film Silva's character becomes some sort of bum on the streets of Mexico City after he quits boxing on a whim because his fake blond American-looking girlfriend en up dating that famous Mexican-American boxer that he hates so much. He then enters a cantina to listen to a world championship match on the radio broadcast directly from the Madison Square Garden in New York City. The match is between and American boxer and upcoming Mexican star Juan Zubieta (whom was defeated by Silva's character earlier on the film). Zubieta defeats the American in its own soil and declares: ""I'm very happy that I won the championship but I'm more proud of being MEXICAN and become the champion. I say this because unfortunately there are people in Mexico who thinks that only foreigners (Americans) are good, that's not true"". The he goes about how Terranova could have been that champion if he have had more courage and faith in himself. Overall a great movie and some kind of character study of Mexico and Mexicans whom a film like Campeon sin Corona was targeted for.",1250121600,2,3274,4.786219081272085
8026550,3,B0002DB0J0,"Campeon Sin Corona, directed by noted filmmaker Alejandro Galindo (1906-99), is considered one of the classic films of Mexico's Epoca Dorada, or Golden Age of film from the early 1940s thru the early 1950s.  I am quite happy to see that it has finally made its way to a region 1 DVD release.

Campeon Sin Corona stars chilango David Silva (una familia de tantas, el topo, castillo de la pureza) as a working stiff who makes it big as a boxer, and suffers from all types of self-inflicted errors along the way which seem so prevalent amongst the purveyors of that profession.  Fernando Soto, aka ""el matequilla"" (the pepe el torro trilogy) plays his friend from the old neighborhood and Carlos Lpez Moctezuma (rio escondido, sombra del caudillo) plays his trainer.  Amanda del Llano and Nelly Montiel round out the cast as his love interests.

While I am very happy to se films like this released, I must say I was quite underwhelmed by Campeon Sin Corona.  This is the first film I have seen with David Silva, but I found listening to his whinging ""naco"" accent, along with that of ""el matequilla"", most unpleasant.  It is surprising how similar it is to current Mexican parlance amongst the streetwise; I am not sure if that accent is due to some Nahuatl influence or simply the result of poor upbringing.  Los Olvidados used similar language but I never found it so annoying.  Silva was not alone, however, as Mara Gentil Arcos gives a performance as his mother which is nothing short of stagy.  And one has to wonder how Victor Parra ever made a career out of portraying gringos when his English is so heavily accented.  Speaking of stagy, I think they used the same set for every boxing scene in the film, regardless of its location.  And even if you compare those boxing scenes with an earlier US film, Gentleman Jim (1941), you'll see how really lifeless they were.  Finally, I think the camera actually went outside the studio a total of three times, twice with very brief shots of probably stock footage.

If nothing else, Campeon Sin Corona made me appreciate other Epoca Dorada films even more.  Aventurera, Los Olvidados, or most anything by Ismael Rodriguez or Emilio Fernandez look really good compared to this film.  For me, the most interesting thing about Campeon Sin Corona was the very attractive, very Mexican face of young actress Amanda del Llano.  I kept thinking that with Fernandez behind the camera in this film, her talents would not have been so wasted.  Rodriguez did direct her in a lead role in La Oveja Negra (1949), and both she and David Silva had minor roles in Fernandez's star-laden Reportaje (1953), neither of which has yet been released on region 1 DVDs as of this posting.

Regarding the DVD, it has no subtitles (neither English nor Spanish) and no special features of note.  Despite my review of the film I still think this is a must buy for fans of Mexican cinema, especially at this reasonable price.",1107043200,2,2944,4.701754385964913
