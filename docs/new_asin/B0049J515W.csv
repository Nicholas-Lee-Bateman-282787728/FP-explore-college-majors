4290153,5,B0049J515W,Wonderful movie for all the family! Very heart inspiring! I highly recommend it to all!,1275782400,,87,4.866666666666666
4290154,5,B0049J515W,"What can I say about The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry. I watched it on netflix and It is one of the most inspirational films I have ever watched. It is a story about how one man can make a difference in many lives. Sounds like many other films you seen? Well not this one....
It makes you want to be that person that inspires, It gives hope. It makes you want to share the bible to more people in  even the most subtle ways.

It bares the lessons that even though some people are resistant to God and his word, acts of kindness although rejected can and do prevail as the doors to the hearts of those that have kept their hearts chained up for so long...

The setting of this movie makes you long to live in a simpler time in history...

This is a MUST see.",1275264000,15,755,4.081081081081081
4290155,5,B0049J515W,Five stars does not give this movie justice. I'll give it a hundred stars. I was even more surprised to learn that this movie was based on a true story. I had no idea Jonathan Sperry even existed until about a little while ago. And I even learned something about the graves that was in the movie- that I never thought about before. People are so wrapped up in there own lives no one ever looks outside the box and think about what could be going on with their neighbors. If more people see's this movie the better their lives will be. Here's a idea buy some movies for your family and friends and then they can buy some and pass the movie to their friends. And I will do this as well.,1275091200,12,684,4.150375939849624
4290156,5,B0049J515W,"I am always looking for wonderful family type movies with a Christian message. I found this movie at Walmart last week and could not wait to see it as I had seen the movie advertised on tv. I was so touched by its content and message and as I watched the movie progress I found myself sobbing. Some said that it had everything but an altar call and that bothered them. I say that more movies are needed with a story that touches hearts like this did for me. I went back to Walmart and bought three more to give as gifts. I did not think it sugarcoated the salvation message. In fact it made it so simple for someone to watch and comprehend what Mr. Christiano was trying to get the audience to see. The scene at the cemetary especially was heart wrenching and also how Mr. Sperry showed the Lord's love to those boys who then took that love and shared it with friends. How can this be a movie that would not be rated 5 stars is what I want to know. I am so tired of what Hollywood has to offer our families and when producers and writers bring us films with a message and with no cursing and one that pierces hearts with the salvation message I say, ""Bring them on!"" I have purchased almost all their movies and also The Morning After films which I enjoyed. I enjoy them because they reach people and they certainly reached my heart with truth and conviction. Families need to watch The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry and plan a discussion afterwards about what it meant to you and other family members. It would be a great addition to your dvd library as it is mine now. Patty Hager",1273795200,21,1579,4.266666666666667
4290157,5,B0049J515W,"I rarely review a dvd but my ten year old son and I sat down last Saturday afternoon to watch The Secret Life of Jonathan Sperry.  I wasn't quite sure what kind of movie this would be BUT I was pleasantly surprised by the intriguing story.  There is amazing cast of actors but it's the message of the movie that will really touch your heart.  I was so glad that my ten year old was watching it with me.  He laughed and cried (well he had tears in his eyes).  This movie is based on a true story.  A story that will touch your soul.  It is not an action, fast moving picture show.  It is a slower make-you-sit-up-and-take-notice movie!  This movie reminds me of the quote by S. Truett Cathy  (founder of Chick-fil-A), ""It's easier to build boys than to mend men."" A wonderful movie for boys but it also gave ""me pause"" -- to think about the words I speak, about the people I (need) to tell about Jesus' love, about forgiveness and what a child learns today will stay with him for a lifetime.  Need a great family movie?  This is it!  A wonderful 5 star watch!",1273795200,30,1058,4.23
4290158,3,B0049J515W,"First of all, I love films where faith plays an important role in the story and where it fits into the movie but is not necessarily the center of the narrative. The latter tend to come across as sermons disguised as movies or books or whatever.  This film has too much of that.  The only thing missing was the altar call and I don't say that to be overly critical.  For being set in 1970 it still comes across as too much like Leave It To Beaver. The 'good' kids seems a little too good and the 'bad' dude seems a little too good, also.  In not wanting to offend the 'church' audience they sanitize it to the point it doesn't seem real.  The bullies I remember used language that offended and other gestures that conveyed less than holy thoughts.  Even good kids didn't always have it together or behave appropriately all the time. While the acting is pretty decent and it has warm fuzzies, it just doesn't come across as a realistic portrayal of the way life happens even to those whose faith is a priority in their life.  Is it a waste of time?  No, it has its merits and there are several meaningful lessons to be considered by viewers. Many will be inspired by the message of the film. There is nothing wrong with the movie, it's just that I would love to see people of faith concentrate on developing great stories where faith fits naturally into the story instead of developing a message and trying to fit it into a movie.  There is a difference and the difference is between a realisic portrayal of life and what we would like to imagine life to be like. This is a film that has a message but ultimately it will probably 'preach to the choir'.",1273622400,18,1650,4.348534201954397
4290159,5,B0049J515W,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in YEARS.  There was so much publicity for ""Blindside"" showing strong Christian values, yet I came away very disappointed.  This movie will NOT disappoint!  Wonderful character-building themes woven throughout the film; deals with many important topics such as the difficulties of losing a father at a young age; the value of senior citizens being involved with young people; kindness and forgiveness; how to deal with a bully; and so much more.  We will definitely be showing this at our church, and passing it around to all our friends.  EXCELLENT!!!!",1273536000,21,596,4.97979797979798
4290160,5,B0049J515W,My children (ages 11-17)and I all enjoyed this movie.  I wish there were more out there like this one... we came away from it feeling inspired and good!  You should definitely plan on seeing this!,1269388800,50,196,4.571428571428571
4290161,5,B0049J515W,AMAZING movie...the movie is set in the 1970's about 3 boys and their lifes in a small town. Very intrieging movie with just a good wholesome story about life and a special friendship with a christian man and his testimony he has for the Lord. A MUST see for all christians and their families of all ages..ANYONE and EVERYONE should see this movie. THe  plan of salvation is clearly seen. A HEART TO HEART MOVIE>> YOU WON't BE DISAPPOINTED>>>very refreshing to have a movie made and shown in the USA in 2010 what a blessing!!!!!!!!!!!,1268697600,77,534,4.621052631578947

We immediately became intrigued by what we read about the movie and set out to see it in a town 40 minutes away. It was well worth the drive!! It is the best movie we had seen in a very long time. Our only regret was that our kids were not with us watching it too. It is the story of a boy learning to cope with a bully while really learning to cope with life as he learns about God and the Bible from an elderly man in the neighborhood. The lessons are subtle at first and a little more direct as the boy becomes more curious and seeks Mr. Sperry out more and more, along with his friends. But even at it's most direct this movie is not heavy handed in a religious aspect. It's more about seeing things and people in our lives from another perspective ... one we might not ever find if we do not seek it out.",1268352000,172,1119,4.833333333333333

It is a fictional movie but gives a true story message at the end. Gavin McLeod is perfect  in his role as Jonathan Sperry.

I thought the movie was a nice family movie with a simple message, right up to the end. Then they throw a plot twist in with one little comment.

Does anyone know if this is?  It's very confusing because at the beginning they say it's fictional, but at the end they give birth and death dates for Jonathan and go through each character giving information about what happened to them after the movie.  Not just one or two characters but ALL the main characters as if they are real people.  I've never seen a film do this except in the case of real people.  If this is fictional in whole, not just in parts (like perhaps some of the incidents did not happen) that would be the only and biggest drawback of the film.",1408147200,,722,4.311111111111111

So many good twists in this movie that honors Jesus Christ through a man (Gavin MacLeod, the Love Boat Captain) who had so many angles of teaching some new friends of his about the Lord.  There are some areas in the movie that drives me crazy - like just move on please with the dialect with the main character for one - make up your mind and go with it quickly please.

Gavin Macleod stars as Jonathan Sperry, who used to star in a string of first rate television shows like ""The Love Boat"" and other shows and has now turned to Christian film projects.

The lead and the other actors are believable and easy to identify with.  The film addressed  problems young people have as they mature honestly. The sets were very true to the time period. This is my very favorite Christian movie, period. I gave it to my son and his wife for Christmas. Do not read to many reviews as they may give away the plot.

I only wish that today's children were that eager to learn about the Lord, it just seems like children that age today are getting more and more selfish and the only thing on theier minds is what they can get, it clearly shows that back then the Gospel was more accepted and today, it's the most rejected way of life than any other,",1379462400,,565,4.09009009009009

Which is amazing coming from someone who usually sleeps during a slow movie.  I think what captured my husband was that age of the boys and them not having a father figure.  It tugged at my heart when Jonathan passed.  The movie was a tad slow moving but at the end -it gave such a REAL feeling to the movie that i felt i had been on the sidelines in the neighborhood watching all this myself.
Both of us really liked this movie.",1375920000,,577,4.153153153153153

Then it was hard to find when it first came out.  After watching the extras, my husband and I planned a ""date day"" and went to many of the locations in the film.  We had lunch at Colleen's Cafe in Brockport and spoke with the owner.  We then journeyed out to Holley to find Jonathan Sperry's home, Mr. Barnes house and the pizzeria.  Which is now named Dustin's Pizzeria.  Very cool.  Very heart warming movie - we watch it at least 6 times a year.  You will not be disappointed.

I really enjoyed this movie, and wish there were more like it. One of the issues a lot of family or christian based films face is the lack of good acting and writing. While a lot of films have an excellent message, not all manage to carry it out while maintaining our interest. My attention span is short when it comes to films, but this one was very comfortable, and I watched the extras on the DVD too. I can't say enough about how much I wish there were more like it.
Jonathan Sperry's biggest secret? He was a man of action, not just words. See the film and see what I mean. It's great to see somebody practice their words in a day and time when we have plenty of preachers. And the ability to bless others without them knowing who was on the giving end. Their reward will be so much greater than those who delight in the praise of men.

Love our enemies, bless them that curse us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them who persecute us.

I think Gavin McCloud's character is well portrayed.  He does a wonderful job.  My favorite part is in the cemetery.  I won't reveal what happens, but the dialogue in that scene is impacting and really resonated with me as a believer.

4290492,3,B0049J515W,"First let me clearly state: I am a Christian, run a Christian movie review ministry, and LOVE a number of Christian films.

I was looking forward to this movie.  This movie has some redeeming things and many Christians obviously do seem to like it (as evidenced by the many 5 star reviews) so part of me just wants to defer to them, however it is my opinion that this movie unfortunately suffers quite a bit from its obvious attempt to try to be ""too Christian"" by using situations that don't really match with real life. In all honesty, the unrealistic story made me cringe in numerous locations to the point that I did consider turning it off. It had a somewhat cheesy, unrealistic quality throughout the whole thing. Plus, the acting was merely ""passable"".  I'm sorry people, but I've seen much better Christian movies...

The basic premise of the story was good - an older man that befriends a young boy and teaches him & shows by example the Christian faith. I think there's probably a part of all of us that want to see a movie succeed that portrays someone from an older generation really impacting and affecting the younger generation in such a positive way for Christ. I certainly do. And maybe that's the explanation for why everyone rates this film so high - because it certainly can't be on acting and production quality and lack of cheese factor!  But while the premise may be good, I honestly believe that the actual execution of it could have been SO much more than what it was. Instead, we get an almost entirely predictable story that tries way too hard to have the characters be exactly what the writers believe that they have to be, if you're following me. Realism was not something this movie portrays in most any way. And thus, sometimes when I see Christian movies like this, I wonder how much harm they actually can do because I can perfectly understand why a non-believer that were to see it would just laugh right through it (at us ""silly Christians"" for producing such a film, that is!). I personally for that reason would definitely only recommend it for Christians, but ""recommend"" might be too strong - I see value in the movie as it does portray some good Christian messages and themes (which given the amount of trashy movies out there is a major plus!), but I feel it could have been much much more than what it was.  I wanted this film to be great and I really felt it could have been...but I think it fell short.

With all that said, it can still be an enjoyable movie for believers to uplift you in your faith and it obviously has done just that for many, so you might want to check it out.

4290493,5,B0049J515W,"With our 11 and 13 year old grandchildren visiting one weekend, we decided to rent this movie.  We were ALL so incredibly moved by this story!!!  We loved it so much that we ordered it from Amazon so that we could share it further with others and to watch it again later!  That is an unusual thing for me to do as I rarely watch a movie the second time.  This time I bought the movie!!!!!!  YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE!!!",1312329600,,415,4.074074074074074
4290494,5,B0049J515W,"I really enjoy watching movies and over the years have watched a lot of them.  This movie ranks very high on my list, not because of its fantastic story line or awesome performances by the performers.  The story line was good and so was the acting.  What makes this movie great is the story it tells and the message it presents.  Since I grew up around that time, I can really relate to the value system and the level of innocence the children had.  It is a movie like this that keeps me watching movies.  Always hoping to find a gem.  The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry is a gem and I highly recommend it.",1311638400,,602,4.228070175438597
4290495,5,B0049J515W,I thought this movie was touching and heartfelt. It had a really strong Christian message throughout. I couldn't recommend it enough.,1311292800,,133,5.380952380952381
4290496,5,B0049J515W,"Our family just loved this movie - especially our kids! Heartwarming with a great message! We were inspired by Mr. Sperry's gentle strength and how he became friends and then shared the Bible with the neighborhood children. We have given this as a gift to several friends. We hope this director will continue to produce more of these well-written and cinematically beautiful films. His other film, Time Changer, was wonderful too!",1308182400,,430,5.070422535211268
4290497,5,B0049J515W,"Yes, it is a low budget movie, but done with excellence. Solid message not shying away from the truth.
This movie will bless the whole family even the very young.",1305849600,,162,4.433333333333334
4290498,5,B0049J515W,"One of the best movies in years.  Robert G.s character is very subtle but made the movie.
The ending actually caught me by surprise, and that takes alot in a movie lately.  Really pulled at me emmoitionally.
This is a must see for all, it will make Christians exam their own commitment, and it shows non-Christians alot of what makes Christians tick.
If you enjoy this movie, I would also recommend watching 'What if'",1305072000,,417,4.621621621621622
4290499,5,B0049J515W,This is a very inspiring movie for the entire family; youth groups and even an entire church to watch.  It is all about the ways that Jesus is teaching us to practice every day.  Forgiveness is what each person needs to practice in order to experience peacefulness.,1305072000,,265,4.617021276595745
4290500,5,B0049J515W,"This movie is outstanding for everyone searching for hope and enlightment in these turbulent times we're living in.

4290502,5,B0049J515W,Every Christian should watch this movie. It is really encouraging. It is clean for the whole family to watch too. It really touched my heart and I am so glad that I found it. It is based on real story as well.,1303603200,,209,4.0
4290503,5,B0049J515W,"I liked this movie. It is a bit odd, but who wants to see the same thing over and over. In real life, boys do not change their entire personalities over night, but I thought the movie had a good message. I did not understand why the boys were not baptized for the remission of sins until I saw the extras, which explains it was created by Pentecostals. I am going to show this movie to my grandchildren. After, we will have a Bible study to let them pick out the good parts of the movie and those that are not biblical. I would recommend this movie.",1301529600,,549,4.140186915887851

4290508,5,B0049J515W,I used this movie with a group of middle schoolers on retreat and found it very helpful in generating discussion and relevant to the situations the kids are finding themselves in today. They related to the bullying issue and I personally appreciated the Christian approach to solving this problem.,1298160000,,297,5.081632653061225

4290511,5,B0049J515W,"We got this as a gift.  Not having heard of it before, I did not have high expectations.  However, our whole family thought it was great.  Plus, no offensive language, no violence.  It was a perfect family movie.",1296864000,,212,4.5
4290512,5,B0049J515W,This is a great movie with a surprise ending!  Several key Biblical principles are woven within the story line that apply to our everyday lives.  It's an awesome movie for the entire family to watch together!,1296259200,,208,4.75
4290513,5,B0049J515W,"This is an excellent Christian movie, one of the best I've ever seen.  Gavin McCleod gives us an example of what a real Christian should be doing, how a Christian should be living and showing an example for life.  This movie I would rate even higher than Fireproof, Facing the Giants and Fly Wheel.  This is a movie for the entire family.",1296172800,,338,4.419354838709677

4290515,5,B0049J515W,This is without a doubt Rich Christiano's best work.  The film is truly moving and feature above-average acting which is a breath of fresh air for a Christian movie.  Add this one to your collection ASAP.,1295222400,,204,4.638888888888889
4290516,5,B0049J515W,"""The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry"" is truly a wonderful movie for the whole family.  It begins in the summer of 1969 with some coming-of-age boys who are enjoying their summer and looking for some measure of meaningfulness in their lives.  One of the boys meets Jonathan Sperry, a man of God and an elder in his church, and thus begins a dialogue that eventually leads that boy, his friends, and others to the saving grace and knowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord of all.  I don't want to tell you much more about the movie other than that, because I don't want to spoil the absolute fun and discovery of how it is all revealed to everyone through simple life events.  If you want a movie that the whole family can enjoy this is it, but more importantly it can really be enjoyed by anyone of any age for its' theme is timeless, and its' message needs to be heard by all.",1294876800,,867,4.333333333333333
4290517,5,B0049J515W,"Inspirational!  Just what you are looking for if you want an alternative to the violence, sex, bad language, and twisted philosophies of normal Hollywood movies.  This one teaches good values and offers hope to the hurting.  It is religious in nature, but it is not a church setting.  This is Christianity shown at work in the way people live and relate to their fellow man.  Great for youth!",1294617600,,392,4.705882352941177
4290518,5,B0049J515W,This a lesson we all could learn from in a world like today...The bible teachings never change just a different time and a different setting.. But the lesson is all the same. If we learn to forgive.,1294012800,2,198,4.378378378378378

4290520,5,B0049J515W,This film surprised me with its great story line and the fact that Mr. Sperry shows us how we all can be witnessing for the Lord. Then to find out in the end that it is a true story makes it a beautiful film and one worth owning and viewing again. A great way to show your kids growing up how to help others come to know the Lord in unobtrusive ways. I bought two copies of this film for my grandkids families. Just a really great inspiring film.,1291680000,,446,4.022471910112359
4290521,5,B0049J515W,This movie is one worth sharing and seeing over and over. The best part is the end. Wonderful message for all fits for all ages.,1291593600,,128,4.16
4290522,5,B0049J515W,This is a wonderful true story! A very good movie to show the important role that senior citizen Christians play in the lives of our young people! A must see!,1291507200,,158,4.3
4290523,5,B0049J515W,"A wonderful movie.
Shows people of every age, how they can continue or begin, to live in Christian way and does it in a way that's entertaining and with examples that apply to today's problems ~ Bullying for example..a problem that's becoming more wide-spread, with the declining morals; but has been something people have dealt with since time began. Also deals with the #1 block to living a satifying life: Unforgiveness..and, redemption; beautifully. Gives real answers to these and other impediments to Christians and those who would or should be Christians.
Very entertaining and refreshingly viewable by every member of the family..in the same room.
Maybe knocking down barriers and opening up conversations on how to implement these lessons
in our own lives and to invite others to view it, too.  The ""extra"" footage is very useful and has behind the scene classic out-takes, of the makers of this movie.  Many were extras who were cast in the little New England town, where it was made, in an actual neighborhood. They were amazingly professional and delivered heart-felt performances.  These kids were outstanding!  Everyone was.  The ""old-timers"" gave emmy-winning performances..maybe their best, ever.  A classic in the making.",1288656000,,1238,5.258883248730965
4290524,5,B0049J515W,"This is a great family movie, it gives you a better look at what the Bible states about forgiving, loving others and sharing God's word.

4290526,5,B0049J515W,"This is one of thee best movies I have ever seen, Christian or otherwise.  PERIOD!!!  :-)",1286755200,,89,4.5
4290527,5,B0049J515W,"This movie hearkens to a simpler time when neighbors knew each other, phones were rotary, an old man could be friends with the town's children, and much more. One of the plots in the movie, dealing with forgiveness, involves a bully. Another is hidden in detail until the end of the movie.

One of the boys has a crush on a girl who is a waitress in a small-town ice-cream shop. He tries to work up the courage to talk to her. He does not know that a note that he had bravely written her was inadvertently discarded, but not read, by another waitress. Then the girl whom he cannot get off his mind off leaves on a long vacation and he has to sweat it out. Finally, he shows a lot of gumption as he converses with her. However, this subplot in the film is sort of left hanging. We don't find out how she reacts to his liking of her except for a terse written message at the very end of the movie.

Jonathan Sperry, the old man who had led boys in the Bible study, dies suddenly. The boys have to struggle to come to terms with it, and to continue to mature in their Christian life without Sperry's stellar leadership and example.",1286582400,3,1128,4.217592592592593

4290530,5,B0049J515W,"This was such an awesome movie to watch with my kids! Them going to Public school for the first time after having been in Privates schools most of their elementary years, this was a great lesson on how to deal with bullies AND not being ashamed to spread the word of Jesus. Fabulous!",1284336000,,283,4.3584905660377355
4290531,5,B0049J515W,I would recommend anyone with children that wants them to be saved have them watch this movie.  It's an excellent film that shows how to become a christian as well as show how it will make a difference in your life.  It also shows how your life can and will affect others around you.,1284163200,,283,4.222222222222222
4290532,3,B0049J515W,"Clean movie. Demonstrates lots of Bible reading, Bible study and a sincere believer. Surprising revelation near the end. Nice character follow-up messages before the credits.  There were many encouragements to read from the gospel of John in particular. Great idea. (I invite you in particular to prayerfully read John 6, in its entirety.) I do not doubt the sincerity of the writer's intent to spread the gospel message, even though I believe he is propagating some popular, unscriptural beliefs.
Here they are:
 1. This movie tells us after death, it's ""heaven or hell, no second chances, no in between."" As a Catholic, that felt like a slam against our doctrine of purgatory, which is both Biblical (yes, I can show you) and wildly misunderstood. Purgatory is not a second chance, but Scripturally--thankfully-- it is a third (temporary) place where our unpaid debts are repaid until we've repaid the last penny and are perfected before being allowed into the Lord's presence. Few of us die completely detached from all sin and in a state of complete perfection. That's what purgatory is for. (It means ""to purify."") Sadly, we aren't instantly purified after death. The Bible does not teach that.
2. After a death in the movie, the minister tells us the deceased is (already) with the Lord. How does he know?  There is no Scriptural basis for that viewpoint.  If you're going to quote 2Cor5:8, please read that again. That verse does not say what you want it to say.
3. This Protestant movie also pushes the erroneous belief in sola Scriptura. There is no Scriptural basis for that false belief. Read 2Tim3:16 again. Once again, that verse does not say what you want it to say.  In other words, nowhere in the Bible does is say the Bible alone is the pillar and foundation of Truth. And nowhere in the Bible does it even include a list of which books should be in the Bible. How did the Bible come to be? Do you really know? And while you've got your Bible out, go back to first Timothy, specifically 1Tim3:15 to find out what the pillar and foundation of all Truth is. Let me give you a hint: it's NOT Sacred Scripture. Which came first, sacred Scripture or the Church? There's your answer.
4. Who has the authority to interpret sacred Scripture? It's not the individual believer. St. Peter had a pretty hard time reading though Paul's letters (2Pet3:16), and the Ethiopian eunuch had difficulty understanding Isaiah 53 (Acts8:26-40).  (And what did the eunuch do immediately after receiving the Word? He did something.  Check verse38. He didn't proclaim Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and savior or even continue reading from sacred Scripture. It's still how Christians are initiated into the faith today.) Now, go back to second Peter, 2Pet1:20. Be careful relying on yourself for a personal interpretation of scripture!  While on earth, Our Lord established an authority to guide us (always). We cannot each be infallibly inspired by sacred Scripture, as we have so many contradictory interpretations of the same Bible passages. Who's right? There is only one Truth.
5. Claiming to quote from the Bible when you're not. Twice Jonathon Sperry was supposedly quoting from the Bible when he said, ""It's better to be at a funeral than at a feast.""  Where exactly is that in sacred Scripture? I'm not sure, though, what point Jonathan was trying to make.

The derogatory use of the term priest also felt like a slam against Catholics, because no one else calls their ministers priests. Bashing beliefs of other Christians is pretty unChristian-like. At the cemetery, Mr. Sperry also pronounced judgment on the souls of the dead. That also is not a Christian's (or anyone else's) job. Let's leave that to God, imploring Him for His mercy while we're still here on earth.

Catholics, before you tell other Catholics this is a great Christian film, make sure you take note of the unchristian anti-Catholic messages, subtle though they may be. They are intentional. Remember, Protestantism began as a protest against Catholicism, and it unfortunately continues along this vein today. Our Lord wants us to be ONE (Jn17):  let's aim for that. These movies have definite value, but would be much better without the (usually) ignorant misrepresentation of Catholic beliefs. Search for the Truth. Again, there is only one Truth.",1282867200,9,4324,4.924450549450549
4290533,5,B0049J515W,"Awesome, awesome, awesome film to watch with your whole family, with your neighbors, with your unbelieving friends... This movie is wonderfully evangelistic! Not just as a means to share the gospel with others, but for motivation to do it as well. We've watched this several times as a family, and with several other families, too. Great movie! I can't say enough good things about it. The acting is superb, the characters are great, and the situations and issues are real. And the gospel message in the movie is not muddled or muddy, but very clear. I wish there were more like this one out there. Rent it! Buy it! Get it! You won't regret it!",1282262400,2,644,4.608695652173913
4290534,5,B0049J515W,"One reviewer called it preachy. If I were not a child of God by faith, I would probably think the same thing. I doubt if many who are not Christians will enjoy this.
On the other hand, I expect most Christians will think it is refreshing, encouraging and challenging. It tells the story of a man who experienced heart-breaking tragedy and another who was responsible for Jonathan's pain. Jonathan took one of Jesus' most challenging directions for Christian living to heart and lived it. Over a life-time it produced startling results.
If you are trying to live a Christian life, I highly recommend this story.
I also learned that Gavin, Murry on Mary Tyler Moore and captain of the Love Boat, came to faith in Christ. I always love to learn someone has!",1281744000,,754,4.676691729323308

That was way underrated, its a well written and acted about how one Christian man changed the lives of many. My kids, 6 and 9 enjoyed it too, I highly recommend this movie for the whole family to see at any age. A very positive message about forgiveness and love for thy neighbor, and based on a true story. I look forward to more classics like The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry.",1280793600,,470,4.3522727272727275

This is one of the best family movies we have ever watched and I rank it at the top along with movies like: Facing the Giants.  We all really enjoyed it - from my 7-yr-old and 9-yr-old sons through my 14-yr-old daughter, to my husband and I!  I wish there were more wholesome and fun movies like this!",1280707200,,435,4.333333333333333

4290540,5,B0049J515W,This is a wonderful movie for anyone looking for a little inspiration.  The circle of life will continue but we have a responsibility to witness and improve what we can while we are here.  Jonathan Sperry shows us that giving and forgiving are great attributes of any Christian's life. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie with my family.,1280188800,,330,4.875
4290541,3,B0049J515W,"I have to agree with the reviewer who thought the story too preachy.  For a kids' Sunday school type story, it has merits, but it was as though it was written to present its Christian message, rather than the message naturally evolving through the drama of the Christian life.  It lacked real drama, and the ending seemed contrived, no foreshadowing to make it seem plausible.

As a coming of age story it lacked focus - tried to cover too many experiences in a brief time span: a boy's first crush; boys coping with a bully; boys losing a friend; an extra caring neighbor contrasted with a bitter neighbor, and a secret which just appeared at the end without warning, while making of Mr. Sperry the Preacher.

It is not bad.  It's just not as good as it might have been had the blatantly obvious preaching been omitted, and had their been some unfolding. It's the sort of movie that only a Christian could appreciate; whereas I believe a good Christian story even an atheist could appreciate. It reminded me somewhat of some better done short stories in a collection of books my mother used to read to me, ""Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories,"" each with a moral.  I loved them as a child, so it's possible children would love this movie.",1280016000,9,1234,4.586363636363636
4290542,5,B0049J515W,"My wife and I watched ""The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry"" this afternoon. What we witnessed was an unforgettable story of a seventy five year old man Jonathan Sperry, who takes three adolescent boys under his wing and encourages them to commit their lives to a closer walk with Jesus Christ. Dustin, Mark and Albert are three friends in the summer of 1970, who are struggling with straddling that fine line between childhood and adulthood known as adolescence. Dustin, in particular, is feeling an attraction toward a pretty classmate, Tanya, while trying to stay out of the way of Nick, a bully, who delights in tormenting those he perceives are weaker and don't fight back. While mowing a neighbor's lawn, Dustin catches the eye of Jonathan Sperry, a widower, who invites Dustin at first to mow his lawn and then invites the three friends over for a Bible study.  With simple life-changing biblical wisdom, Jonathan inspires the boys to apply the lessons of Jesus to their daily lives even to the point of interceding for their worst enemy, Nick.
  This film conveys the beauty of Christian commitment in a simple, practical fashion. There is no droning intellectualism or self righteous condemnation. This movie is genuine in that Jonathan wants each boy to give their lives to Jesus and make a difference in someone's lives by their witness. Jonathan is a true mentor whose delight is expressed in the seeds of faith which he plants, waters and watches grow. Gavin Macleod is priceless as the venerable wise senior who dispenses faith as readily as homemade lemonade. Robert Guillaume is great as the crusty neighbor who is at first suspicious of peoples motives until his life changes. It is a joy to see each child grow in grace under the tutelage of a man, who loves unconditionally despite hardship and loss. It is a pleasure to see a movie which respects the Lord  and is unashamed to give Him rightful glory. I would recommend this movie highly for the whole family to see.",1279929600,6,1980,4.814705882352941

and applies to every human being. I bought a copy for myself and watched it many times and then bought a
copy for a friend. Every one can learn from this movie. It teaches a bully behaves this way because of
difficulties (often unknown to the bully)  in his life. There are many lessons about forgiveness, Bible Study,
Christian life and it's far better to give than receive.",1279238400,2,481,4.404494382022472

4290547,5,B0049J515W,"Our entire family enjoyed 'this movie,' and I found it to be one of the best family movies of all time.

The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry takes us back to 1970 when times were simpler, but forever a need to tell others about the saving grace of Jesus Christ. The characters are very likeable and there are humorous parts dotted throughout.  Here is a quick look at the main characters:

Dustin is raised by his mom after his father dies. He's thoughtful and kind and always ready to lend a helping hand.

Albert is a silly boy who struggles with keeping a tight reign on his tongue. He provides much comedic relief.

Mark is the braniac who seems to have knowledge far beyond his years.

Nick is a bully who is also being raised by his mom and who has no qualms about picking on Dustin and his friends.

We also meet Bailey, a girl whose father owns the cafe and whom Dustin has a crush.

Jonathan Sperry is a 75-year-old man who is active in his church and taught Mark's brother in Sunday School. He lives out his faith and allows God to use him to make an impact on the lives around him.

One of the things I loved most about Jonathan Sperry's character was that he actively lived out his faith. He wasn't preachy, yet he showed real-life examples for each lesson. I especially loved the lesson where the boys had to reach the $5 bill on the picnic table. The graveyard scene is also a scene full of impact that depicts the urgency in telling others about Christ.

Two of the boys in the movie grew up without fathers. What a wonderful example and mentor Jonathan Sperry was especially to those two boys.  This movie had strong themes of redemption, faith, forgiveness, and kindness.

This is a heartwarming film for the entire family. While not preachy, it does share an important message. There is also nothing objectionable in the movie, and I highly recommend it!

I have added The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry to my Mom-Approved Family Movie list on my blog. A definite must-see and one of my favorite movies of all time!

4290552,5,B0049J515W,"This is the fictional story of a man who influences the lives of some young boys in a small town. Although the movie is supposed to be set in the 1970s, the characters act more like one would expect from the '40s or '50s. The children actually say things like ""Yes sir"", and yet it's not set in the South from the lack of Southern accents; I never saw any children in the 1970s (when I was a child) act like they did. The neighborhood looks like perfect picture small town America and the boys spend their summer at a local pizza place and fishing. The three boys come to know an elderly man who feeds them well and spends a lot of time giving them object lessons about the scriptures. I like every Christiano film I've ever seen (and that's many!,)and even as unrealistic as the events of this movie seem to be (such as Nick's outcome and how Mr. Sperry just happened to be able to fill in some of his past for him), I really like this one, too. I especially like the second note that the boy gives to the girl he has a crush on; the contents of it were surprising and made me cry. I did think the film ended abruptly and I would have liked to see the relationship of the boys and Mr. Barnes developed more. The very end of the movie seemed cut off after the big reveal of the connection with Mr. Barnes and Mr. Sperry, and then only the quick future of each of the major characters spelled out, but the movie had delivered the message so I supposed there wasn't much more for the main plot to continue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes old fashioned inspirational movies.",1278201600,,1589,4.247524752475248

4290555,5,B0049J515W,"I have been wanting to watch this movie as soon as I saw it advertised.  Sadly no movie theaters in my area would carry it.  I found it in Wal-Mart and decided to buy it.  My family and I watched it that night.  What an amazing movie.  Even my 6 year old was entranced by the story.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it.

It wasn't until the end of the movie that I realized it was based on a true story.  Wow!  What a testament to this man's life.",1277856000,2,441,3.9204545454545454

I have three boys ages 4 through 10 and they were able to easily connect with the young boy characters in the movie.  Gavin McLeod as Jonathan Sperry was stellar.  The casting of the rest of parts was fitting and believable.  Best of all, the real star of the show was Jesus Christ and his life-transforming love.",1276560000,2,455,4.369047619047619
4290561,5,B0049J515W,"I bought this children's DVD for my grandson who has a problem at school with bullies.  This story is about a 12-year old boy who cuts grass for Jonathan Sperry.  The boy shared his concern about a bully at school.  Jonathan Sperry helped the boy understand why that boy is a bully and how to handle the situation in a Biblical manner.  Jonathan Sperry paid the grass cutter to mow his neighbor's yard who turned out to be the man, drinking and driving, killed his beloved wife.  Near the end, the grass cutter, his two friends, the bully and his two friends become Christians and share Bible Study together.  When Jonathan Sperry died suddenly, the grass cutter started holding home bible studies for his friends.  The man who killed Sperry's wife started reading the Bible.  All the children grew up to serve God in different ways.  It is also a story of forgiveness.",1276387200,2,869,4.627450980392157

One is on forgiveness--a neighbor (played by Robert Guillame) killed Sperry's wife in a car accident but Sperry still sends the original boy over to mow the neighbor's lawn on Sperry's dime.
