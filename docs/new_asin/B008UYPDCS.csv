5183619,4,B008UYPDCS,The little girl loves dogs so loves this book. I would get this agin for her. It is a cute story,1358121600,,96,3.619047619047619
5183620,2,B008UYPDCS,"The CG effects in this movie are so bad that they had me crying and about to fall out of my chair. Children will probably enjoy it because of the ""cute"" puppies as I'm sure that's the target audience but my God it is funny. The puppies teeth look like piranha or shark teeth and my wife and I were laughing uncontrollably while my four year old daughter tried to watch this. If you REALLY dislike someone or just want a laugh you should watch this movie. HIGHLY recommended if you have small children or have an overly retarded and silly sense of humor.",1354665600,5,553,4.326923076923077

5183623,1,B008UYPDCS,"This movie has puppies talking with cg generated moving lips, be warned.  In other respects the movie is mostly quite amateurish.  The puppies are cute and children might enjoy the simple messages of the film.",1348963200,,209,4.942857142857143

5183640,2,B008UYPDCS,"My 5yr old liked it. I however prayed for my life to end rather than watch this. I stuck it out to spend quality time with my son, but unless you are into torturing yourself I would skip this one. So bad. Overall could have been a cute movie if the execution wasn't so poor. Don't even get me started on common sense mistakes made in the details of the movie.",1391644800,,359,4.070422535211268
5183641,5,B008UYPDCS,"My 4, 5 and 7 year old grandchildren loved this movie. It is a heart warming tale about puppies trying to find their mom and the funny events that took place before they were reunited.  This is a good family movie that adults can also enjoy.",1389398400,,241,4.239130434782608
5183642,3,B008UYPDCS,My toddler won't stop talking about this movie - she's obsessed. The movie is extremely cheesy and painful to watch.,1376697600,,116,4.85
5183643,4,B008UYPDCS,Since I love Golden Retrievers so much this is a feel good movie for sure. I will enjoy watching it often.,1367366400,2,106,4.095238095238095
8530645,4,B008UYPDCS,Though it was sad to see what happened to the mom I still liked this movie.,1529366400,,75,3.75
8530646,2,B008UYPDCS,"Though there are cute puppies in this movie, it is not for children. I started watching with my six year old but stopped early on because she felt scared. I finished it by myself.  Andrew Beckham does a good job as the main character, and I enjoyed much of the show. However, the ending was a let down because it seemed  forced and not believable.",1527292800,,347,4.323076923076923
8530647,5,B008UYPDCS,This movie was adorable and the puppies have me wanting to get my own just not one like Tinkle lol,1521417600,,98,3.95

8530652,4,B008UYPDCS,"I  like  it  alright.
It  points  out  a  few  issues.
Mainly  friendship  &  trust.  Who  to  trust  &  who  not  to  trust.
Its  not  the  best  movie  I've  viewed.  I  found  it  funny  & entertaining.
&  not  as  interesting  as  other  puppy  movies.  Some  people  who  watch  this  might  not  find  it  all  that  exciting.
Puppies  were  funny,
&  it  sort  of  symbolizes  what's  right  &  wrong  in  real  life.  Here  in  this  movie  the  puppies  pick  out  the  boy  they  can  trust,  &  rely  on  him  to  help  them  find  their  mother.
Puppies  are  cute.
So  I  settled  for  this  movie  it  wasn't  the  one  I  was  looking  for.
I  was  actually  looking  for  (Santa  Buddies).",1503532800,2,705,4.128205128205129
8530653,1,B008UYPDCS,"This is NOT a happy movie. I would NOT recommend this for children. It creates fear on many issues including adults leaving their dogs in an abandoned, locked house, dog mom being torn away from her puppies, puppies being left to figure it out for themselves, no food or water for puppies, teens breaking into house as if it is normal activity, teens intimidating other teen, etc. Only in the last 2-5 minutes does the conflict resolve itself where all ends happily and the dogs are reunited and they have an adoptive family. This seems to be a very low budget film and tears your heart out. Children love animals and when they see them in pain or anguish it has a lasting impression in the subconsciousness for years.",1501459200,,718,4.573643410852713
