4463309,5,B004SKIR8K,"I really enjoyed viewing this documentary Dr. Gates did of Black in Latin America.  I found it very educational and very enlighting.  The thing to remember here is that there are millions of people who are the decendants of Africans who were stolen to become slaves in another part of the world. We are part of the African Disporia, we're are in Europe, Latin America, the U.S., the Carribean and many other parts of the world.  Even though today we are of different cultures and experiences, we share that one thing that we are the decendants of those Africans stolen a long time ago, we are the African Disporia.",1319760000,9,614,4.614678899082569
4463310,3,B004SKIR8K,"I have seen each of the segments of this documentary series.  While I applaud the fact that Henry Louis Gates Jr. is exploring the very significant African roots of Latin America's cultures and people, it presents an interesting question: Who is ""Black"" in Latin America?  For Gates, who comes from the U.S. (where hypodescent and its most extreme form, the ""One Drop Rule,"" were the dominant cultural practices), it is very easy to see who is ""black"" (which would be virtually anyone with visible, or at least likely, African descent); however, ""race"" is not as simple as this in Latin America.  Having a degree of African ancestry, be it slight or highly significant, never relegated people automatically into the ""black"" category in Latin America-- because of this, the black/white ""racial"" dichotomy that exists in the U.S. does not apply to Latin America, and utilizing this template (which is what Gates does throughout the series) gives a very distorted view of ""racial"" relations in Latin America.  This is especially evident in the segment on Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where mixed-identified Dominicans are viewed critically; in contrast, black-identified Haitians are given the tag of having a ""noble"" history and heritage by Gates and are portrayed as being completely victimized by their neighbors in the Dominican Republic, making it obvious who he (Gates) favors and where his biases lie.

Its a worthy attempt, but ultimately, it is obvious that Gates does not really understand Latin America, its people, or its culture.  Therefore, his presentation fails because it is coming from a place of biased ignorance.  However, on the plus side, some interesting historical facts are presented, and there is plenty of beautiful imagery and music to be found in the series.",1318809600,33,1789,5.16955017301038
4463311,3,B004SKIR8K,"This is a great documentary that many should see.  It will really wake many up to the numbers and range of the African Diaspora.  I applaud the efforts used in this film.

However, Dr. Gates has the WORST pronunciation of Spanish and Portuguese words that I have ever heard.  If you are a Harvard professor, you have enough money to buy some foreign-language cassettes at the bookstore around the corner.  You have the loot to afford Rosetta Stone products too.  Heck, you could have sat with some fellow profs in the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Departments and got the knack of those languages within an hour or two.

Yes, it's a trivial matter.  However, someone as smart and accomplished as Dr. Gates has no business garbling up two languages somewhat similar to the English language so mercilessly.  He should truly be redfaced on this matter.",1317772800,8,847,4.826388888888889

4463314,5,B004SKIR8K,"I have recently purchased this DVD.  Dr. Gates is phenomenal.  I have previously purchased Dr. Gates' other DVDs: African American Lives, Part I and II and Faces of America.  His programs are extremely informative and educational.  Dr. Gates proves that America is truly a multiracial and multiethnic nation.  There is no such thing as a pure American racially or ethnically.  Many so-called pure Americans are very surprised to find a distant ancestor of a different race and/or ethnic group somewhere down the line.

His latest program is extraordinary.  Blacks in Latin America have an ambiguous status.  The average Latin America is either biracial or triracial with European, Native, and African ancestry.  He/she is quick to acknowledge his/her European and Native ancestry but is extremely loathe to mention his/her African ancestry. This program is a complete eyeopener!  I recommend Black in Latin America for everyone regardless of race and ethnicity.",1308355200,73,961,5.382550335570469

I never knew France drained a billion dollars of Haiti's treasury in retaliation for the defeat of France in the 1803 Haitian Revolution. French blood sucking only ended in 1947. Nor did I know US-supported Dominican Republic dictator, Rafael Trujillo, even knowing he had Black blood flowing thru his veins, hated Blacks so-much, he had thousands of Haitian and Dominican  Blacks slaughtered. I learned it was only after the ouster of another US-supported dictator, Fulgencio Batista, did free health care and 100% literacy come to all Cubans.

4463364,5,B004SKIR8K,I watched these with my oldest daughter (13) and we both enjoyed it. I already overstood how the slave mentality effects Blacks in the American diaspora. But to learn more about how it effected our people in the other America's was very interesting. This doc gives you first person accounts on the more recent after effects of slavery. There is also plenty of history and background provided also. Any Black person with some form of African American history knowledge should know about some of our freedom fighters. But to learn about some of the other ones from all over the America's is eye opening. This doc brings more of the puzzle together.

4463366,5,B004SKIR8K,"I applaud Dr. Henry Louis Gates for this excellent documentary series, which explores the history of the slave trade in Latin American, and its lasting impact which arose to establishing a rich culture among the oppressed and enslaved Africans.  Yet this excellent series goes further, detailing the brave men and women who rose up in protest and revolt against  their enslavement.

Indeed, this documentary allows the audience the historical backdrop of the response among African slaves and 'mixed race' peoples to the Portuguese, Spanish, and French slave owners who brought them to work , particularly on the sugar plantations, and also in mines in the Americas.

This rich African heritage dating back five centuries is extraordinary in how the various Latin American countries would evolve from the anguish of the oppressed, who would rise in protest and revolution to become unique multicultural societies forever tarnished by racism, classicism, prejudice, and personal identity based on skin color which has persisted through the 21st century.

Thank you, Dr. Gates for this great history lesson.

4463367,5,B004SKIR8K,"Henry Louis Gates Jr. isn't one of my favorite black historians, but I'll give him a thumbs up on this DVD. Black history in Latin countries is an avoided subject. I saw the show on PBS, and I decided to buy this DVD. It shows the African contributions to Latin America that many people don't know about or deny it outright. Maybe Mr. Gates will get a chance to do a few more Latin nations.

 The DVD is 4 hours long. He talks about 6 Latin nations and their African roots and slavery: Haiti, The Dominican Republic, Cuba, Brazil. Mexico, and Peru. The DVD talks about the racism that still exist in these nations today.  Anyone who is interested in black history should purchase this DVD. I recommend it.",1403395200,2,705,4.449612403100775

4463405,2,B004SKIR8K,"Just some very general thoughts, since there is too much to deal with and create a readable review of this generally sorry documentary.

1. The first thing that annoyed me to NO END was that he showed black people dancing in every single segment. And yet, there were almost no black people shown holding books or doing anything intellectual. Even among the museum curators, I don't think I counted a single black black person. So, if you want to see a bunch of dancing idiots (and MTV/ BET/ VH1 just doesn't have enough of them), then this documentary should put you over the top.

2. The Haiti and Dominican Republic segment was......uncomfortable. On one hand, he showed us DR-- people who don't think of themselves as black and who have built a relatively prosperous country. On the other hand, he showed us Haiti. That is a place where everyone thinks of themselves as black and is an absolutely AWFUL looking place. Gates couldn't be bothered to take us to ONE single nice looking neighborhood. And Haiti is all the more embarrassing, since it has been independent for over 2 centuries and is actually POORER than when it started out. (Gates had some vague excuses about just why this might be so.)

3. In the Mexico section, the people flat out told Gates that: a. This is not like the American example; b. Don't try to reinterpret it as that; c. We don't think of ourselves as black (in the sense that American people do). And it was also interesting that the only people that he talked to (and that saw this as a social issue) were people in academia (academics are out of touch everywhere in the world).

4. In the Brazilian section Gates ended at a university (again) with some students talking about the *smoldering* social issue of affirmative action. Earlier, he'd mentioned that there was a lot of white immigration in decades past (thereby bringing people with more talent than locals who also happened to be white), but when he noticed that there were more whites in ""better"" jobs/ positions, he automatically defined that as discrimination. From there, he did some pontificating about the necessity for affirmative action (because of course no black person would EVER have done/will do anything or gotten/ will get ANY job without it).

5. Would this have been complete without a trip to Cuba? Yes, Gates noted that most of the Cubans that got out were white Cubans and so are the ones that run the country. But then, he mentioned that they were years ahead of the United States. But the question that he didn't ask (and that we weren't meant to ask) was: ""Would you rather have more equal distribution of an income of $1 or less equal distribution of an income of $10?"" I don't see black people from America moving to Cuba to participate in its bounty.

6. The most annoying recurring theme:

a. Gates (in some country) kept (implicitly) defining all differences in income as due to discrimination.
b. Then, he would show some character waffling on about ""we have had equal rights since 18XX.""
c. Finally, he would fail to conclude that equal rights/ opportunities don't necessarily lead to equal results.
d. He would then take some swipe at the United States (which, incidentally, has a higher per capita income than ALL of the countries that he showed and whose black population has a higher income than those surveyed).

I'm just glad that I saw this on Youtube where I didn't have to actually pay for it. I'd think myself ill used if I had.",1344902400,8,3462,4.682565789473684
4463406,5,B004SKIR8K,"I have been studying African race relations for some time now and found this DVD by professor Gates to be a very good addition to my collection. Any educational documentary that is informative with good commentary goes a long way in helping me understand the various cultures around the world. It is interesting to note that countries in Latin America don't consider themselves as Africans, but more of European descent. It was interesting to see that there is wide spread race problems existing in these countries with a heavy African population. Educational and those interested in African culture should add this DVD to their collection.",1344729600,10,640,5.104761904761904
4463407,4,B004SKIR8K,"Mr. Gates has again provided an interesting piece. Black & Latin in America left me wanting to explore these cultures in more depth. To seek those in my own community; to hear their perspective of being Black & Latin in America.

Thank you for continuing to keep us challenged to look outside of ourselves and to view through anothers' eyes.

Well done my friend!",1344297600,3,363,4.65625

4463409,5,B004SKIR8K,"Henry L. Gates Jr. certainly is an authority in the search of the African influence in America & now also in the Caribbean. Majoring myself & still doing research in this same topic but concentrating in Borikn (known as Puerto Rico) and the Caribbean, this documentary has been immensely valuable. Very little recognition is always being given to some of the Caribbean islands, especially those of spanish invasion as being more European, and devaluing and/or denying the Aboriginal and African influences. Beautiful work Mr. Gates and looking forward to future gems.",1332633600,8,567,5.241758241758242
4463410,3,B004SKIR8K,"Unfortunately, this is not a long enough place to do a thorough review.  Instead I am doing a video review that will be much longer than the space allotted here. I believe Dr. Gates intentions are good, but he falls to the centrism of his own upbringing and seeks guidance from people who cater his views. He does present some good info, but flawed by his own tunnel vision. This is the review on his Dominican claims. More will follow later.
