2658004,5,B000IJ79T8,"Viewed with sweating palms and a sense of anticipation, we sat on the edge of our seats while watching The Decoy. I was pleasantly surprised at the professional level of acting, the beautiful Arizona settings and all over digital picture quality. I was most impressed by the acting of Jake McDaniel who plays the evil non-blinking villian 'Herb'. Jake embraces the villian's evil personna through brute strength without so much as batting an eye. He makes a convincing, frightening menace.
I would recommend this feature as it was exciting, entertaining, well written and well acted, a pleasure to all who saw it with me, we all throughly enjoyed The Decoy.",1186358400,4,657,4.9818181818181815
2658005,5,B000IJ79T8,"The Decoy is a good example of solid independent filmmaking.  It has a compelling story, likable (and dislikable) characters, strong acting, and several memorable moments.  It respects the western tradition without being outdated.  I enjoyed the movie very much.  The special features are also very worthwhile, giving enlightening and enjoyable insight into moviemaking at this level.  I definitely think everyone should check it out.",1185321600,4,434,5.71875
2658006,4,B000IJ79T8,"Amazon provides almost no information on this title, so I'll attempt to fill in a few of the blanks.  This is a 2-DVD, 10-episode collection of the groundbreaking ""Decoy"" television series that aired, in syndication, during the 1957-58 television series.  Beverly Garland stars as Patricia ""Casey"" Jones, a New York City policewoman who acts as an undercover ""decoy"" to help solve crimes in the Big Apple.  The show -- both interiors and exteriors - was filmed entirely in New York City and environs.  The episodes in this collection feature some terrific guest stars and character actors, including Martin Balsam, Arthur Batanides, Frank Campanella, Nicholas Colasanto, Albert Dekker, Colleen Dewhurst, Mike Kellin, Lois Nettleton, and Zohra Lampert, among others.  But it's Beverly Garland who carries the show; wisely, she portrays Officer Jones in a low key, unglamorous style which adds to the show's authenticity (Margaret Leonard, a real life detective with the NYPD was the show's technical advisor).

While there has never been an officially licensed release of ""Decoy,"" apparently some (but not all) of the episodes of this series have fallen into the public domain resulting in  several previous DVD releases of ""Decoy,"" most notably from Alpha Video and Critics Choice Video.  So why should a prospective purchaser consider this release from the Timeless Media Group?  The principal reason is that five episodes in this collection have not previously appeared on commercially available DVDs.  The source prints used for this collection are of the usual 16 millimeter syndication variety and have not been restored.  That said, the visual quality of these episodes is marginally better than the releases from both Alpha and Critics Choice, especially in terms of the picture contrast.  Here are the episodes included in this collection:

To Trap a Thief*

The Savage Payoff

Deadly Corridor

The Glass Necklace

Across the World

High Swing*

Night Light

Shadow of Van Gogh*

Tin Pan Payoff*

Blind Date*

*Episode available on other DVD releases

Bottom line:  ""Decoy"" is a solid late 1950s crime series with a terrific female lead and makes good use of location filming in New York City.  This is an easy recommendation to fans of classic crime series from television's golden age.",1172620800,6,2295,5.236263736263736

2658055,4,B000IJ79T8,Had no idea Timeless had released 10 episodes of this great '50s gem! Alpha has released 20 out of the 39 shows that were produced in '57-58.  The difference...Timeless release has better quality transfers and are quite watchable compared to major contrast issues and blurry quality on Alpha releases.,1458259200,,301,5.142857142857143

2658059,5,B000IJ79T8,"The movie was a little slow getting off the ground,  I was expecting the typical shoot em' up cowboy oater. What I didn't expect was a film more involved with the charactization of the individuals themselves, something about good and evil, right and wrong, standing on principles  even to the death. About 2/3 of the way through I was scratching my head wondering if this was going anywhere, then the big bang of plots happened and I couldn't have turned away for anything.  Was this a typical western ? Absolutely not . Was it a good film ? No. it was a superb film. This could have been a great human study drama in any era or setting . If you're out for a shots fired and body count action flick pass  this one by but if you're looking for a damned good movie that takes it's time getting there but makes it well worth the wait then I highly recommend this one. I'll  watch this one over and over again.",1456876800,2,906,4.2748538011695905

2658087,3,B000IJ79T8,"I saw so many negative reviews about this movie and started not to watch it but decided to give it a look and realized I'd watched this once before and just as the first time, I liked the movie, contrary to popular opinion. I guess I'm just not that ""up"" on what is supposed to be deemed good or bad, but the story line was a good one, and the acting  was nowhere nearly as atrocious as others made it out to be. Granted, it wasn't a Kevin Costner grade movie but it still was good and Martin's redemption at the end, and the lesson that the young law man learned were priceless!",1402704000,3,579,4.123893805309734
2658088,4,B000IJ79T8,"Loved it! Story of true friends and justice will prevail in the end.

2658102,1,B000IJ79T8,"Not very well produced.  Poor acting along with poor script make this one hard to follow.  As a western, this movie misses the mark.",1388793600,2,132,4.458333333333333
2658103,1,B000IJ79T8,"Don't waste your time, I did. Nothing could redeem this movie, the best actor and the best lines were from the mute. OMG was this horrible. The clothes, the backgrounds, the town were from an old wild west show or something. Who really knows what the old west may have been like, but this wasn't it. To many photos from the era prove differently, though that alone does not make one movie or another better or worse. I just clearly disliked the movie and the timing.",1384560000,2,466,4.430232558139535
2658104,1,B000IJ79T8,Bad Acting.  Bad Script.  Who cares about the story.  Un-necessary.  Why did someone spend their money to make this?  Not worth a review.  It was just that bad.,1373241600,,160,4.535714285714286
2658105,5,B000IJ79T8,"Okay, so its not a shootem up bang bang western with lots a action and Romance. I liked it, grabbed a couple tissues tword the end, and upset a third of the way into it, ""John, you said you've known him all your life an you thought he did it? "" didn't know him very well then. Okay so their not top notch actors, makes it more believable.  You have your cold blooded, emotionless killer, your backstabbing (literally) family friend and partner, your mild manored smuck who gets the blame and everyone believes it, your average everyday jerks, and of course your bright and shinny tin star, clean living, righteous,  hero. Anyone notice how he's always so clean and pressed compared to the other character's, even with a bullet and blood in / on his arm, ( just an empression that came to me) Must be his halo, although, just like a lot of us, he forget about it when things became personal. Anyway, Maybe it's cause I can relate to some aspects of the show. Hey,  they did the best they could and that's all I ask for. I love movies (cept horror, thier 's enough around as it is.

2658106,5,B000IJ79T8,"Beverly Garland appeared in this syndicated tv series which started in 1957. It was distributed by Official Films, which also distributed Four Star Playhouse. Dateline Europe. Peter Gunn and many other popular series. It was the first police woman series on tv. In the episode ""The Showplace"" she sings a song. In the 1970s it was possible to buy used 16mm prints of this series, and I bought several of them myself. She also appeared in some of Director Roger Cormans' movies: ""Not Of This Earth"", ""The Alligator People"" and others. In her early career she was known by the name Beverly Campbell, as she was in the movie ""D.O.A.""  She appeared in many filmed tv shows as a guest star in the 1950s and 1960s. You can see a list of the many movies and tv shows she appeared in, at the IMDB Data Base. Good hunting.  A. B.",1370217600,,820,4.46
2658107,4,B000IJ79T8,"Apparently a cheaply produced movie with mostly unknown actors. Some of whom can actually act. The old sheriff being one of them. The main character seems to be constantly working at not over acting and comes off as rather flat and ineffectual in his performance.

Not a bad little story with a sort of old fashioned plot but interesting enough.",1365811200,2,345,4.75
2658108,1,B000IJ79T8,"This DVD has the look and feel of a group of friends getting together and making a movie.  Very low budget and little acting experience/skill.  The story has some pretty major flaws and the action is pretty amateurish.

The filmmakers show some potential considering those limitations they worked with and might be great someday, but this is not that day.",1241049600,7,355,4.883333333333334
