But it was difficult to find a good quality dvd set with excellent english subtitles, until now. I loved the DVD set, the shipping was right on time. Overall, a great story, super English subtitles and amazing customer service
Thank you!",1525564800,,335,4.419354838709677
8229847,5,B000XULOOS,"I love, love this series!!! A little pricey for some reason, but I am happy to own it. Wonderful story, fantastic music and great acting by all. Korean movies and series put Hollywood movies to shame, in my opinion!!!!",1437782400,,218,4.615384615384615

8229850,5,B000XULOOS,"I loved it. It is clean and full of family fun. Who knew that I would really enjoy watching episodes of a Korean TV show? I am not even half-way finish, but I am anticipating what will happen next. It's 960 minutes of lessons learned.",1364860800,,234,4.222222222222222
8229851,4,B000XULOOS,"I couldn't decide if I should give this three stars or four.  I decided on four because the story is very touching and the little girl is a show stealer!  The reason I would have rated it lower was because the mother (who was so enjoyable in ""the Greatest Love"") played the role a bit too weak for my taste.  I think she is trying to portray a very nice person but she came off as being a doormat for anyone to step on.  However, that said, overall the characters were engaging.  I especially fell in love with grandpa and the little girl!  Well worth watching!",1352160000,4,561,4.245283018867925
8229852,5,B000XULOOS,Step into the shoes of a 8 year old girl with HIV. If you can keep a straight face through the entire series then you are no longer human. The series is that moving. I've watched a lot of Korean dramas and this one is at the very top of my list along with Wish upon a Star. The child actor played the part perfectly. I really recommend this series to anybody.,1277510400,8,359,4.0
8229853,5,B000XULOOS,"Great Amazon buying experience. DVD Package was recieved in excellent condition. ""Thank You"" is an absolutely wonderful story; it will make you laugh, make you cry, romantically moving, will make you want to hug your child, is educational, and so much more. The child actress was amazing! My wife and I rate this drama 100 Stars!",1251936000,6,329,4.892857142857143
8229854,5,B000XULOOS,"Standing ovation for all!!!
Thanks to MBC for investing in this mini-series. Director Lee Jae Dong and scriptwriter Lee Kyung Hee (LKH) once acknowledged on the onset that the story was not on a popular theme compared to most Korean dramas. LKH was thankful to MBC that she wasn't writing under pressure for high ratings. Thanks to LKH for writing such a gem which makes other dramas look ""pale,"" childish and shallow. Thanks to LKH, director and the crew for picking the perfect cast. Thanks also for the wonderful cinematography which brought us so much into life as if we were living in that beautiful island with Young Shin, Bom, Grandpa and Gi Seo. Thanks to the cast for their excellent performance. Jang Hyuk, Gong Hyo Jin, Shin Goo, Seo Shin Ae, Kang Boo Ja and Jeon Won Joo are superb. It is a mini-series that warms your heart, and invokes your thoughts about life, love, and relationships with people.  Thank you for reminding us to have a thankful attitude no matter what life brings!
By the way, the OST is absolutely beautiful!
