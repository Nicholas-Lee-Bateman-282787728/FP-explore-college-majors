7038249,4,B00UGPYJLK,"This workout is very challenging, which I love! I've been doing barre-style workouts since I was 13, starting with Callanetics (which is super challenging but also boring). I have moved on to Squeeze and Pure Barre (which are both totally awesome), but I'm always looking for a new challenging barre workout. I bought the Fluidity barre and DVDs on craigslist and when I first bought the barre I tried out the beginner workout which was just too easy for me. So today, years after buying the barre, I popped in the advanced DVD. I must say I'm very pleasantly surprised. The leg work on Pure Barre is a bit more challenging but the Fluidity Advanced DVD uses the barre in really interesting ways (pull ups, etc.). I will definitely be adding this into my barre rotation, it's a great workout.",1279324800,13,792,4.664285714285715
7038250,4,B00UGPYJLK,"I had bought the original system over two years ago.  I wore out my DVD, so I had to buy another, I may steer away, but I always come back to the work out and results.",1277164800,9,167,3.638888888888889

8705982,5,B00UGPYJLK,"Beautifully put together. This exercise regimen will give you a evenly tone body. No bulky muscles, no killing yourself or becoming out of breath, just smooth, intelligently focused exercises that work. I bought this about 5 years ago and it is still my favorite exercise routine. You only have to do it three times a week for 2 weeks and you'll see a difference.",1383177600,8,363,4.6875
8705983,1,B00UGPYJLK,I tried it in my DVD player and there was nothing on it.  Went to the Library used theirs nothing.  I contacted them and they said mail it back that no one else had a problem.  I was not about to send it back and pay for shipping for something I got at a low price.,1378944000,,265,3.6964285714285716
8705984,5,B00UGPYJLK,This is a great workout for a dancers body!  I will make you shake and burn but it's all worth it!!,1370390400,3,99,3.7142857142857144
8705985,5,B00UGPYJLK,"Fluidity is wonderful. I love my Fluidity Bar. A sleek design and folds up easily and neatly. If you can afford the whole barre system...I say get it. If not...try the moves with a high back chair. These Advanced moves will challenge your smallest accessory muscles and create a long, lean body structure. I do the Elliptical 3x a week on low resistance and Fluidity Advanced 2-3x a week. I also recommend trying their Fluidity NY Real Class DVD which is approx. an hour of their most challenging moves (once the Advanced DVD is mastered). I think of Fluidity as a natural 'Corset' for my body. It really just smooths & pulls everything in while lifting everything up! Firm, feminine muscles...with no heavy bulk. Have a dancer's body!",1362787200,11,735,4.75
8705986,4,B00UGPYJLK,Great workout with deep work into the muscles and good stretches after each group of exercises.  Works all the major muscle groups and shows three different intensity levels which is good since i'm at different levels depending on what group of muscles are being worked.  Similar to the intermediate video with longer leg and abs routine.  I've been using this video along with the intermediate for about a month and definitely feel more toned.  I didn't give this a 5 because i was expecting it to be more unique and different from the intermediate video.,1358812800,7,556,4.821052631578947
8705987,4,B00UGPYJLK,"I saw the infomercial for this years ago and said I needed that, so I got it.  (This also includes her DVDs on the beginner and intermediate levels which the advanced is built on with a few additional moves.)  After doing just about anything and everything to keep my flabby self toned, I will say that this is challenging.  I am not a graceful person who can move with the ease of a ballerina by any means, but if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything.

This workout is about firming things up and making the appearance of flab disappear, so it will BURN in places you didn't think you will be able to burn in.  With the exception of the pull ups and maybe the Water Ski, you can do just about everything without the barre by holding onto the back of the couch, a high backed chair or a desk.  The hardest move is that of Pretzel where you are sitting full on the floor and lifting your leg just a few inches off the ground.  It gives a nice lift to the butt and thighs and make you harder all over.  This focuses primarily on the butt, tummy and thighs.",1358294400,26,1069,4.155339805825243
