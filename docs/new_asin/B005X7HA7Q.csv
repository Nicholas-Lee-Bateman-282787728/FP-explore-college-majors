4902410,5,B005X7HA7Q,I would like to know if the Pole Position Cartoon will get it's own set and if not are all 13 episodes included in this one?,1323561600,,124,3.8076923076923075

David Coburn who played the voice of Dan Darret in ""Pole Position"" went on to play the voice of ""Captain Planet"".

The late great Ernie Anderson who was the announcer on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" did the opening narration for the ""Jayce and Wheeled Warriors"" show.

Nice bunch of non-violent adventure cartoons with a story emphasis on teamwork..",1469404800,,487,4.705882352941177

8488391,3,B005X7HA7Q,"First of all, I thank ""Mill Creek"" Entertainment for reopening the DIC Animation Library at an affordable cost.

Now, the bad news for me. I already own ""C.O.P.S."" and ""Jayce..."" in their ""full season"" forms. For Pole Position (which kind of reminded me of ""M.A.S.K."" since I first saw this series in reruns on the Family Channel and, almost a decade later, on USA), I had one of two options:

A. Continue to wait for an (unlikely) full season release (10 episodes out of 13 are here).
or
B. Grin, bear it, and buy this release without the great episode ""The Secret,"" or ""Shadow of a Trout"" and ""The Trouble With Kuma.""

The rest of the ""Pole Position"" series is here, so again, thank you for that. Enjoy!",1395187200,6,705,4.4921875
8488392,5,B005X7HA7Q,I ordered two of these for my DVD collection and to remember the times of my childhood recaptured to share with my now adult child hahaha. The 80s were a time of rockin roll and great cartoons.,1389312000,,193,4.243243243243243

8488394,2,B005X7HA7Q,"First off I'd like to be clear that the two star rating I've given this set in no way reflects the actual cartoon content, but instead the clueless DVD manufacturer/distributor Mill Creek and their shoddy handling of their 80s cartoon properties.  I was ecstatic to hear that Mill Creek and Cookie Jar were partnering up to release CJ's vast catalog of 80s DiC cartoon properties on DVD, but so far the releases have been almost completely missing the mark.  For the most part MC has been releasing sets that are almost identical to previous releases of the same cartoon that other companies have discontinued (He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, Bravestarr, Defenders of the Earth, C.O.P.S., and Dungeons and Dragons), and in poorer quality with stripped-down packaging.  But there was a gleam on the horizon as they began to announce new-to-DVD sets and continuations of sets that had previously been unfinished on DVD.

That's where this set falls.  This 3-Disc sets complies episodes from three different cartoon series, C.O.P.S., Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and new to DVD Pole Position.  The problem I have is that each of these discs is for all intents and purposes, Best-Of discs that only contain 10 episodes from each series.  There is a complete C.O.P.S. available from Mill Creek for the series fan, and there appear to be new complete Jayce DVDs on the way as well.  But Pole Position, which is a series of only 13 episodes, gets short-shrifted by three episodes.  Mill Creek did this with a similar release, the Get Along Gang.  As far as I can tell there are no plans to finish either Pole Position or the Get Along Gang on DVD, so fans of these shows will always be three episodes short.

But to add insult to injury, this set contains 3 bonus episodes.  Are they the three missing episodes of Pole Position?  No.  One of them is a duplicate episode of Jayce, one is an additional episode of C.O.P.S., and there is an out-of-place episode of Hey Vern, It's Ernest.  How an the producers of this set be so short-sighted that they didn't even bother taking an opportunity to make this set at least complete for the one series that would benefit from it?  Because these are the barest of budget releases (which Mill Creek specializes in), and they honestly don't care.

For those interested, the picture and sound quality is more than acceptable, though not perfect.  The packaging is the standard Mill Creek deal as well, with the discs individually housed in black paper sleeves that clip into a section on the inside of the case.

At the end of the day, 10 episodes are better than nothing.",1326844800,2,2614,4.730684326710817
8488395,3,B005X7HA7Q,"Just received my dvd from Amazon. Excited about having an authentic Pole Position release in region 1 (even if it's three episodes shy of the complete series)and owning a better picture quality Jayce/Wheeled Warriors than my Shout Factory set. I was first surprised to see the standard 14mm case because Mill Creek usually use thicker 20mm cases for similar releases. Then I really got excited after learning there were 3 BONUS episodes, naturally thinking I now had eleven episodes of each series...wrong. Cops (which I hate) and Jayce each have a bonus episode, but not Pole Posiition, plus they're mixed around. Even worse, the Jayce bonus episode that appears on the Pole Position dvd is already on the Jayce dvd. If Mill Creek couldn't use the remaining three episodes of the Pole Position series as the 3 Bonus episodes, they could've at least given us one more, instead of the Hey Vern, It's Ernest episode which appears on the Cops dvd. Another huge disappointment is that the three discs are kept in paper sleeves (which doesn't make since for small collections) instead of a regular 3-dvd case with the inner flap. I guess I'll have to find a beter case later. Picture quality wise, I've seen better. It's looks almost transfered from VHS,complete with lines but very clean. Though I have issues with this collection, I'm happy with my purchase. Besides the great price and not having to use page over on each discs episode menu to see the complete list of episodes, the best part is each show's music playing during their respective main and episode menus. The Jayce music in particular is awesome. The closing theme is why I love 80's music so much. I can't wait for the next Mill Creek collection.",1326499200,8,1710,4.8
8488396,5,B005X7HA7Q,I bought this only for Pole Position.  I already have the other cartoons.  It's $9 so why not.  You get ten episodes of each cartoon.  I don't know why they did not just add the last three episodes of Pole Position.  And it's not remastered.  Looks very good though.  For $9 bucks though who cares at this point.  It was worth it.  Mill Creek will come through I hope.  I have not seen Pole Position for 25 plus years.  It was great to see this cartoon again.  Thanks Mill Creek.,1326499200,9,479,4.2
