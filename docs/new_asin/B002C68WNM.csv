3903967,5,B002C68WNM,A must see film.  Morgan Freeman did a great service to this community by being a catalyst for change.  The students of this small Mississippi town made history by showing the courage to resist racism and stand up to the stale tradition of their parents.  End the Cycle of hate.  I show this film in my U.S. history class and students are amazed to see segregation being practiced today.  A great learning experience.  HBO films did a great job with this documentary as they always do with their films especially great thought provoking documentaries like this one.,1266796800,5,565,4.77319587628866
3903968,5,B002C68WNM,"I had the good fortune of seeing writer/director Paul Saltzman's outstanding documentary 'Prom Night in Mississippi' at the 2009 Dallas AFI Film Festival. Saltzman gave an excellent Q&A after the film.  It won the award for Best Documentary in Dallas and sold-out the theater.  It doesn't appear that the film actually made it into commercial release (it's not listed in Box Office Mojo), which is a shame.  You can make up for this injustice by renting or buying the DVD.  It's well worth your time and money.

The story is instigated by Morgan Freeman's attempts to end the long-standing practice of separate proms (white, black) in his hometown of Charleston, Mississippi.  However, Mr. Freeman plays a relatively minor role in Saltzman's film.  Instead, the filmmaker turns his cameras on the students, educators, administrators and parents.  It's fascinating to listen to the interviewees discuss the history of the town, its events and how things came to be.

What struck me most about Saltzman's movie is this: by training his camera on a few selected protagonists, he unveils insight and nuanced, complex thinking from unlikely quarters.  That he gets it from some of the students is one thing.  There are some smart, thoughtful kids at this school.  But that it comes from a self-described 'redneck' kitted out in camouflage is something else entirely.  I'm referring to parent Glen Sumner - his attempts to articulate parental attitudes and the reasons behind their baked-in biases is brilliant, emotional and brave.  During the Q&A in Dallas, when one of the questioners asked Saltzman to carry word back to Mr. Sumner of her admiration of his courage, she got an ovation from the audience.  It's the type of film that elicits that type of enthusiasm and emotion.",1261785600,10,1774,5.048109965635739
3903969,4,B002C68WNM,"Excellent exemplar for teachers addressing contemporary race/ethnicity issues in the US. The ending sequence of the prom itself is overly long, but this movie is highly recommended.",1370131200,,181,5.7407407407407405
3903970,4,B002C68WNM,Great movie about diversity. I saw this movie in one of my college courses and it amazed me as to how prevalent racism is and it's 2012. Great to watch and a meaningful lesson.,1336780800,,176,4.205882352941177
3903971,5,B002C68WNM,"This is an awesome documentary for everyone. A middle schooler and a septuagenarian would find it equally interesting. The story of modern day racism in a small southern town is one of heartbreak and fear. The students must overcome the restrictions put on them by their prejudiced parents, and it's all with the help of America's favorite man Morgan Freeman!",1329609600,,359,5.0
3903972,5,B002C68WNM,"I grew up in Florida in a segregated school system in the 60's. We had riots when the first black person attended school. It is hard to believe that it could even be an issue. This documentary shows how a school wanted to combine black/white dance from both schools. This was in 1970. We face the same problem today with Hispanics, Muslims, gays...the list goes on and on. Watching this show helps to show people how how ridiculous it is when we don't tear down these wall. Morgan Freeman is involved in trying to get the prom dance integrated. Worth watching/learning.",1320624000,,569,4.643564356435643
3903973,5,B002C68WNM,"The main lessons from this inspiring film: 1) If it were up to the kids they would have abandoned the narrow cage of racism long ago. 2) Parents, don't keep our youth in a cage; open the doors and let them fly. So what if blacks and whites wish to marry each other. Their ""mixed"" offspring would face heavy challenges, true; they might end up in the White House. Morgan Freeman is a hero in inspiring a school to transform not only Charleston but other towns as well. Just imagine what more could be done if hundreds, thousands of other prominent people like him went throughout the country to do similar deeds of courage and transformation.",1305158400,,641,4.5344827586206895
3903974,5,B002C68WNM,"Prom Night in Mississippi follows senior high school students as they embark on a historic journey - the first racially integrated prom in the school's history.  This isn't the retelling of an old story though, the prom is in 2008.

In 1997, the actor Morgan Freeman offered to pay for the first integrated prom.  The school declined his offer.  In 2008, when he offered again, the school and students accepted.  The film follows students as they react to this wonderful opportunity.  Their community is still influenced heavily by racism.  Many of the student's parents (and some students) are racist and that has affected relationships among the students in school.  Some parents are angry about the integrated prom and they hold a white-only prom for their students.  Ultimately, the integrated prom goes on.  Students of all colors come together and have a wonderful time.

This is an inspiring film.  It forces me to ask myself, what can I do to make the change I hope to see in the world?  The film ends with a boy who has chosen to keep his face hidden, he says, ""they may be mad, but they'll be happy longer.""  My review doesn't do the film justice - just SEE IT!",1305072000,,1171,4.648780487804878

3903976,5,B002C68WNM,"I had lived in Mississippi, in a small town for 4 years.  I had heard about the segregation when I was in school up in NJ and NY state.  (When I moved there, my then-husband's family referred to me as a ""Damn Yankee Carpetbagger"".)

This movie touches on a subject that most people don't realize is still prevalent in Mississippi and other southern states.  The segregation issue is handled very tastefully.  The horrid ""N"" word is not used at all.  The students were very open and honest in their opinions.

I watched this movie as a Netflix recommendation.  I would recommend this movie for all high school educators to utilize as a tool to show how segregation was and still is, and as a cultural awareness lesson.

I have always admired Mr. Freeman's work, and this is one of his finest films yet...",1288656000,,803,4.559440559440559
3903977,5,B002C68WNM,"The characters are very real and relatable.  Several students were moved to tears or outrage by the things they witnessed.  I incorporated it into high school classes before our winter formal and prom, since I have different students both semesters.  I have never recieved a complaint, no one put their head down, no one was bored.  All of the students who watched it shared real emotion after viewing.",1286236800,,402,4.867647058823529
3903978,5,B002C68WNM,"I came to this movie with great interest, having attending the first integrated prom in a small MS town in 1984. Freeman did some talking and interaction with students and school officials in the opening part of the movie, but it really documented the kids' attitudes, as well as some of the adults. The filmmakers tried to be as honest-candid as possible, and folks were quite open, the kids most of all, though given the intensely touchy nature of blatant racism, much was left unsaid, especially the more strident racist views - which continue to exist today. The movie walks you through Freeman making the proposition to the school council and then the senior class, all the way through to the prom - kids getting ready, lots of interviews with individuals and friends and couples - black and white, kids and adults. There were no shattering insights about why racism continues to exist, but what people did say was very meaningful to hear, touching on how it affects nearly every aspect of their daily lives. I was rapt throughout. And I'm certainly very grateful to Mr. Morgan for taking the steps that he did. With any luck - and hard work - this change in folks' attitudes will stick, and grow. A very good documentary about a serious and neglected subject.",1273276800,5,1265,4.728506787330317
8363237,4,B002C68WNM,"""Tradition is one thing, Morgan Freeman remarks. Idiocy is another,"" he immediately adds. The movie takes a look at a shocking form of racial bigotry as it comes to an end. A Mississippi town with less than three thousand residents holds its first ever integrated prom. The film gives cameras over to the young people themselves and shows how truly messy all of the little interactions are not just past color lines but also class lines and gender lines.

The only real flaw, though somewhat of a big one, is that the movie seems to lack a lot of context. It only touches upon the broader situation of inequality and prejudice within the southern U.S. as a whole. Some additional scenes, particularly in terms of what happened to the students after the prom finished, probably should've been added. At the same time, though, the raw and sincere feelings of all of the young people as they make history get a much-needed spotlight. The film, in the end, is absolutely worth watching.",1523318400,,982,4.742690058479532
8363238,5,B002C68WNM,"I use this in my classroom to illustrate that racial divides are not something that ended with the Civil Rights Act. It's a great way to show how young people in a small town  population is smaller than my school  are working  to break down barriers. It's been a fabulous addition to my lessons, the kids really enjoy it and I plan to keep using it until the DVD wears out! And, of course, you get to see Morgan Freeman. You can't go wrong with that.",1489881600,,450,4.209302325581396

8363241,4,B002C68WNM,"I actually really liked the movie. They did a great thing i think by
changing the generations of lessons that have been taught. I don't see
any reason for dissemination. I do think they could have had maybe more
parents involved to get more options. There was only one white dad that
spoke and i think they could have done better with that. Alsio i think
them learning to be together now they will help when they go off to
college, that was only a small town. Another thing is i don't see why
people have be that way towards the blacks. Everyone needs to be equal

8363244,5,B002C68WNM,"I used this informative and eye opening documentary as a life lesson for my Virginia Seniors (for 2010, 2011, 2012) as they prepared for prom. They enjoyed the ""old school"" fashions and prom preparation. They found this story amazing due to the segregated proms being held in this small Mississippi town until Morgan Freeman intervened and paid for an integrated prom. You receive insight into the thoughts, beliefs, mindsets and views of the high school students, school board, teachers, families and Morgan Freeman.  I believe there is a follow-up documentary/interview. If not, there needs to be a ""Where Are They Now?""",1389052800,,622,5.158415841584159
8363245,5,B002C68WNM,"I applaud Mr. Freeman's contribution to his home town.
Unfortunately the South and it;s racism will always rear
it' ugly head. The young people in this documentary
have made great strides but the adults have not.
Having been born and raised in Texas, I know  how
important  my Senior Prom was. I really can't say if
my prom would have been better if it were integrated

Having graduated in 1965 segregation was just a part of
life for Black students. Fortunately our kids now days  are
not a part of Jim Crow and the old South. Having said
that I recommend that you purchase this video I am' sure
that you will find it very down to earth.  .",1383091200,,641,4.352941176470588
