Although we may not all aspire to being competitive athletes,  the movie is a tribute to the extent of human possibility and the power of will and the power of positive choice.  The filmmakers approach their subjects with admiration but also with a realism that avoids fawning, I work with many older adults as their physician, and wish that all my patients could see this film. It is one of the best I've seen.

The way they weaved in the background of the athletes and made them come alive during their competitions was awesome.  Thank you for making this film.  It has motivated me to try even harder in, not only my athletic endeavors, but in all areas of my life.  To hear the stories about the obstacles these women had to over come just to stay alive is enough to inspire me to do more each day.  Again, thank you for making this film and I hope it will be seen by as many people as possible.

8064903,5,B0009PU92K,"I watched the film, Racing Against the Clock, with some friends last weekend.  We were three generations of women spaning an age range from 22-82.  We loved it.  The women were so moving in their passion about sports and in their committment to push themselves as far as possible.  They were such an inspiration.  They were brave, sassy, intelligent and fun!  You felt knowing them  would be a blast.  They clearly showed us that life may just begin at 50 and in this culture of youth worship that is a feat!!  I hope it will be seen by many people.
