8122681,5,B000FI8MIY,"Awesome Italian 70's cop flick. No Shame knocked it outta the park. Too bad it's long out of print and No Shame is out of business. But all that aside, a very entertaining (and kind of under-the-radar) Italian cop movie with plenty of shootouts and action. Right up there with Lenzi and Castellari. Pick this one up if you want a fine example of Italian cop movies.",1481414400,,365,4.462686567164179

8122683,3,B000FI8MIY,"Unlike one reviewer, I do not fault this film because it is a 1970s euro-crime thriller, which today's standards make somewhat dated and heavy-handed.  After all, it IS a 1970s euro-crime thriller! It was never meant to be a psycho-sociological treatise on modern crime.

What I ask of any film - this one included - is, was it worth watching?  My answer for this movie is, yes.  Here's why.

First of all, the brutality is gripping even by 21st century standards.  Compare it to 1970s hollywood crime movies and you'll see they pale by comparison.

Second, it is a tightly edited, fast paced contest between the two main characters.  While this plot device is obviously not original, the skill of both the director and the cinematographer in portraying it is.

The transfer is terrific.  NoShame really did a first class job in this release.  The bonus is a second disc of Luciano Ercoli's final film, La Bidonata, which was never released due to tragic circumstances.

This may not be my favorite movie, but what's not to like?",1245715200,,1029,4.751412429378531
8122684,2,B000FI8MIY,"""Quelli della calibro 38"" or Colt 38 Special Squad (1976) from
Massimo Dallamano, is an Italian language crime-thriller, that
actually explains how law enforcement  approaches a a hostage
situation involving the entire population of Turin, in exchange
for money, gems, and more under the threat of 70 kg in dynamite
being detonated in the city.

With over 30 years since the release date having passed, the
strength of the overall work, is its wide-screen release,
extraordinarily sharp and colorful images, spectacular street
chases involving cars in actual downtown city areas, and dirt
bike chases in the woods, on mud trails and country side. It also
has a tight editing of scenes, and a convincing argument, showing
thrills, suspense along the way, while the special effects are
fine, in both quality and in number.

The action explores, amazingly, the entire gamut of criminal
behavior, such as kidnappings, shootings, gun firefights, bank
stick ups, escape cars,  payback on innocents when the law is
applied, hostage situations,  motorcycle and automobile stunts,
(including one showing a car driving forward on a moving flat bed
train), car crashes, dangerous street chases, confidential
informants on underworld events, bribes, interrogations, cop car
frequency band snooping, underworld gambling operations, booby
trapped cars with radio detonators, ransoms, car and motorcycle
jackings, impersonation of officers, joy riders, rifle sniping.

From such a large number of underworld aspects, it would appear
that a check-list was almost prepared ahead of time, to cover all
the bases and of what could happen with a gang on the loose.

The story is also about ego's, and the need for people, in this
case, the detective, to save the population from destruction
through his own personal talents, efforts and skills (in a Walter
Mitty sense.) It also underlines that in a crisis, the population
may be kept in the dark, from the need in avoiding creating a
panic, that itself could cause havoc.

From a cultural point of view, the film is a time-capsule, as all
the vehicles from that era are shown, Renault 5, Citroen, Fiat
125, 127, and other models, with the European quality of the time
...real wood steering wheels, sculpted wood coat stands, lira
currency,  expensive clothing, trendy night clubs and more. This
would suggest an  upper-middle to wealthy class  of individuals
in this action.

Conversely, the weak spot is a total absence of humor in the
movie, coupled with a dated soundtrack, showing a 70's style.

Another aspect is the surreal demonized behavior of many law
breakers, suggesting all bad guys, have  no feeling, no humanity,
when in reality, the assumption may not be the case.

In sum, the technical elements are outstanding, but an excess
litany of underworld behaviors suggest a somewhat lack if realism
making it somewhat too didactic.",1239926400,,2872,5.199566160520607
8122685,3,B000FI8MIY,"Lame film, where having a .38 special is something terrific.  The ""7-Ups"" this is not.  Great tranfer and special stuff included by NoShame flics.  But this one's just really lacking plot or character interest.  Interesting for the mustaches.",1237248000,,242,5.2894736842105265
8122686,5,B000FI8MIY,"This is a great example of a Euro crime film. It stars Marcel Bozzuffi (best known for his role as an [....] in the film French Connection ie he is the one who is on the poster for the film being shot in back by Gene Hackman). Anyway, this film was heavily influenced by the best of the Dirty Harry sequels ""Magnum Force"". However, these cops are not vigilantes.
 Great action, lots of violence and is very fast paced. No shame films has done a fantastic job on bringing this film/dvd to North America. The liner notes are great and each film that No shame releases gives you a brief history lesson of turmoil in Italy during the 1960's and 1970's.
 Needless to say, this film is highly recommended",1182038400,3,698,4.403100775193798
