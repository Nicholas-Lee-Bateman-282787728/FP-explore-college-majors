8616281,5,B00FKAAOZQ,What a wonderful way to celebrate the City of Light.  I'll watch this over and over until I return myself.,1453161600,,106,4.3
8616282,5,B00FKAAOZQ,"UNBELIEVABLE! This is a MUST-WATCH film -- if for no better reasons than it shows you a Paris you'll never see in any Juliette Binoche film, AND it reveals just how long the colonial immigrant underclasses have been subjected to institutional racist maltreatment in Europe. The supplemental disc will bring special joy to viewers! Bravo, Monsieur Marker!",1416096000,2,354,5.228070175438597
8616283,5,B00FKAAOZQ,Enthralling...Just saw this documentary on PBS and had to buy it.  It was so raw and real and so very interesting to see how things have changed and stayed the same from the 1960s.  The Algerian element was so well explained and loved the interviews.  The interviewer asked the most thought provoking questions and received thought provoking answers in return.,1409616000,2,360,4.966666666666667

8616285,5,B00FKAAOZQ,"I don't know about the digital streaming version, but i have the DVD version and it is fabulous and the sound is perfect. In fact there are several versions (English and French) on the DVD and the audio on all of them is fine. There is also a 2nd bonus disc with outtakes, other shorts films, and an interesting behind the scenes short bit with the cinematographer about how it was shot. All of it looks and sounds fine.",1388880000,8,420,4.329113924050633
