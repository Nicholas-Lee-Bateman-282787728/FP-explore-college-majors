7864788,2,6304180675,Really??? I like to watch Foreign movies. It gives me a different perspective on others views. I like to see other kind of movies that are not just Hollywood's big budget movies. This movie just was a bad idea.,1385078400,,210,4.410256410256411
7864789,1,6304180675,"Although the story line is somewhat interesting, the photography is worse than of a rank amateur. The person handling the camera can't hold it steady and sometimes it seems that he or she has some form of palsy.  The exposure goes from underexposed to over exposed. They put in scenes which have absolutely nothing  to do with the subject material.  The two main characters a good looking but that is all that one can say of this film.  Two thumbs down to use the phrase of the late Mr Siskel and Mr. Ebert.",1372118400,,507,4.419354838709677
7864790,2,6304180675,"It could be erotic at times, but for my understanding it was not a great film, Its pointless, so if You want to see just rent it, I got mislead with other reviewers about the film",1242777600,,179,4.0
7864791,4,6304180675,"I found ""I Like You..I like You Very Much"" a bit difficult to get into at first but as the story progresses it all falls into place. Quite well shot cinematically with not a lot of dialogue involved. Definitely a lot of body language and the plot follows the use of this very well. Perhaps as others have found this is part of Japanese culture and once you have realised this then you can appreciate it but if this is a first experience then you might be put off by it...I would say a great representation of gay Japanese life and perhaps one if not the best to date....",1121817600,6,570,4.238532110091743
7864792,5,6304180675,"Yu and college boyfriend, Shin, share a working-class flat. One afternoon, while waiting for a train, Yu sees and approaches hunky, jean-clad Taka, and whispers: I like you, I like you very much... Yu confesses this meeting to Shin, disturbing their relationship, and leading each to seek out others for both comfort and ... As they work things out, this short, not overly explicit, Japanese pink film subtly reveals many facets of both Japanese culture and ... life.",1041292800,9,467,5.0
7864793,2,6304180675,I have seen this movie two years ago. I still have quite vivid movies about it.... Now I have been in Japan for a year and can better relate to the culture as an average american could. So if you don't know Japan don't see it. If you do if might be worth while.,991612800,2,261,3.8518518518518516
