5047188,5,B0071BY2PU,I remember seeing this before on PBS but having my own copy is great. I have watched it 4 times already and still see something new each time. I especially enjoy Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers. The additional footage with select artists was very good. The banjo rules in a jazz setting. Thanks for a great presentation.,1359331200,9,330,4.610169491525424

5047191,4,B0071BY2PU,A very interesting video about the history and evolution of the banjo.  Enjoyable music.  Disturbing history about exploitation of blacks in minstrel shows.,1354924800,,156,5.739130434782608
5047192,4,B0071BY2PU,"I recently read a great book about Eddie Peabody, one of banjo's early superstars (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-with-the-Banjo/dp/1604946679/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man with the Banjo</a>&nbsp;by George Robert)that piqued my interest in this instrument. I watched this DVD to see if I could find more information on Eddie Peabody, but although he was referenced only briefly, I still found this documentary well worth watching. This is an excellent and highly entertaining documentary following the history of the banjo and it's influence on American music, specifically Blue Grass.  It seems that this instrument has recently enjoyed a resurgence in popular music used by artists such as Taylor Swift, The Civil Wars, Mumford and Sons, Modest Mouse, etc. and this documentary provides a good history of the instrument. I also enjoyed Steve Martin's narration and performance with his band.",1351209600,4,938,6.106060606060606
5047193,4,B0071BY2PU,"An entertaining documentary that traces a uniquely American instrument from its humble beginnings, through the clawhammer style of the Appalachian players, and culminating in the flashy, more urban bluegrass style. This video explores the contributions of major banjo performers and innovators as the storyline progresses. Give Me the Banjo is an entertaining and informative resource for both banjo players and students of American musical culture.",1346889600,,449,5.923076923076923
5047194,5,B0071BY2PU,"Very entertaining, engaging and educational overview about the banjo. My kids even enjoyed watching this presentation about an often (in my opinion) misunderstood/ underappreciated instrument. What a wonderful presentation, narrated by an American treasure in his own rite, Steve Martin.",1345766400,,287,6.2
5047195,5,B0071BY2PU,"One reviewer here has noted that this may not be a good film for those who are not already fans of the banjo (or bluegrass perhaps).  So let me say right up front that I'm a huge fan of both.  I play a little banjo; having come to it late in life, I am no expert.  But I've been listening to bluegrass all my life, and fell in love the very first time I ever picked up a banjo.

That's the background I bring to this review.  My own personal take is that this is an excellent film about the history and development of the instrument and its playing, for anyone, big fan or not.  Sure, it doesn't include *every*thing -- I don't know a documentary that does. There's always more that could be said about anything.  This film tends to slant towards the development of bluegrass-style (picking) banjo, as opposed to traditional (clawhammer, frailing) banjo. With that in mind, it hits all the major pieces along the way -- and it's fun, entertaining, informative.  If you've any interest at all, it's worth the time and money.",1340064000,6,1023,4.433155080213904
5047196,5,B0071BY2PU,"Caveat: I am not an expert in the history of music or in the banjo. Yet, I have found this documentary fascinating. I haven't realized how rich the history of this instrument is! The movie is superb in terms of filming/cut. I love the music, you can actually feel the dirty, raw power of the early performers, and compare it to the much more structured and channeled world of current afficionados. It is really fascinating how average Joes used the banjo just for applied entertainment, in lack of radio or other media.

I highly recommend this video to anyone who is either interested in the history of the instrument, or in general in the complex relations of the American history (I am not American and I've learnt quite a lot from it, racial and class relations are all reflected in the history of the banjo). Also, since the banjo is uniquely American, and since the documentary is really entertaining and informative about history in a non-boring way, I believe it is an excellent gift for non-Americans :)",1339718400,5,1012,4.7175141242937855

5047201,4,B0071BY2PU,"I enjoyed the video and particularly enjoyed the historical background dealing with minstrel shows and Black songsters.  Another strength was the discussion of Earl Scruggs - how can you go wrong with that?  But what I missed was any discussion of frailing either in the early 1900's or currently.  I know there is more to the banjo than minstrel shows and bluegrass!  There was also almost no discussion of the tenor banjo - which was very important both in minstrel shows and cakewalks and was/is important in Irish banjo in the US.  I know it's a relatively short documentary, but still . . .",1424390400,3,595,4.6826923076923075

5047205,5,B0071BY2PU,"This is a great, informative watch. In the interest of time, this documentary hits all of the cultural and societal high and low points associated with the banjo and it's place in musical history. It also opens some eyes to the fact that the banjo is not just simpleton yokel's instrument, that there is a great complexity to it. And, there's more than just bluegrass banjo...",1414454400,2,376,4.712121212121212

5047210,4,B0071BY2PU,"I enjoyed this DVD about the Banjo. My Grandfather use to play when I was a kid. It brought back old memories of him, the good ole days. I also enjoyed seeing Steve Martin play the banjo; he seems to play as good as anyone. The history of the banjo itself and the many musicians I have never heard of was worth watching and purchasing this DVD. It had my home town favorite Earl Scruggs.",1393372800,,387,4.173333333333333
5047211,5,B0071BY2PU,"I throughly enjoyed the DVD although I expected to see more of Steve Martin. It was an interesting history of the banjo,
 not at all disappointing. It was not only entertaining but very educational. I would recommend this to anyone.",1390089600,,232,4.8
5047212,5,B0071BY2PU,"Not what I expected. Better! Recommended to me while waiting on line for a Bela Fleck, Tony Trischa, Eric Weissberg, Bill Keith, Richie Sterns, Noam Pikelny autographs. After seeing Steve Martin at this year's IBMA concert, I appreciate how serious he takes his banjo playing and it's history. This DVD was a nice mix of history and music that sheds new light on the banjo. I enjoyed it from start to finish and thank that guy who stood behind me for recommending it. So now I recommend it to you.",1385424000,14,497,4.533333333333333
5047213,4,B0071BY2PU,"I thoroughly enjoy the five string banjo and this film.  If your're looking for something about the history of the instrument there is some in here but I'd recommend ""Throw Down Your Heart"" for an origins story.  Actually I'd recommend watching ""Throw Down Your Heart"" for some background of the instrument and then watching this for background on the instrument's path through American culture once it arrived here during the slaving days.  ""Give me the Banjo"" is not an all inclusive look into the banjos African roots or an exploratory journey into ALL of its niches in the American music scene but what is covered is covered well and I believe most any banjo enthusiast will enjoy the show.",1384214400,,694,4.815126050420168
5047214,2,B0071BY2PU,"The PBS Documentary ""Give Me The Banjo"", while praiseworthy for an attempt to trace the history and music of the instrument in America, falls short of giving an accurate portrayal of banjo history. The film almost entirely focuses on the five-string banjo and its relation to bluegrass. In doing so, it almost completely ignores the four string banjo and its relation to jazz and popular music, and does a tremendous disservice to American musical history and the instrument itself.
  From 1910 through 1960 the four-string banjo WAS America's banjo, while the five-string banjo and bluegrass music passed into relative obscurity. The four-string banjo was significantly more popular than the five-string ever was, and was seen and heard in concert halls, dance bands, radio, television, and recorded music. While watching this documentary, my thoughts were: this is great history, and very interesting in terms of bluegrass, but when are they going to begin a discussion about the four-string banjo in American music?
  They never did. A few seconds of Don Vappie, and a brief segment on Cynthia Sayer in the special features is all the listener is given. This video has re-written the history of the banjo in America, and not in an accurate way. While praising to the skies the great bluegrass stylists on five-string the producers and writer completely ignored contemporary four-string mega-talents like Buddy Wachter, who is arguably the greatest living banjoist in the world. And the legends of the four-string banjo, both tenor and plectrum, such as Eddie Peabody, Perry Bechtel, and Harry Reser are either glossed over or completely ignored.
 This video should be titled ""Give Me Bluegrass: A History of Country Banjo in America"". We are still waiting for the quintessential history of banjo in America. This video isn't it.",1381017600,14,1831,5.193220338983051

8508151,5,B0071BY2PU,"""Give Me The Banjo"" documents the cultural and musical history of the banjo in the US, giving due credit to the role of African-Americans.

Among the featured musicians are Dom Flemons, Rhiannon Giddens, Charlie Poole, J.D. Crowe, Pete Seeger, Mike Seeger, Earl Scruggs, Tony Tony Trischka, Bela Fleck, Abigail Washburn and Steve Martin.

The movie takes viewers from pre-Civil War years, minstrel shows (with their racist stereotyping), the early days of recording and the Great Depression to the folk revival and the great players of today.

That's a lot of ground to cover -- perhaps too much. There are worthy players left out.
