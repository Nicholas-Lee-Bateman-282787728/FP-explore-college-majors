7555905,5,B018V1ZX88,"Well worth the viewing:  hugely funny repartee between River and The Doctor. Kudos to the writer! Some wonderful acting by the whole cast. Great fun and - at the end - speaking only for me: completely satisfying...  Never heard ""Hello Sweetie"" said with such tenderness. I haven't purchased other Christmas specials from Dr. Who. This one is a keeper!",1451174400,20,351,4.932203389830509
7555906,5,B018V1ZX88,"FINALLY!!! A Capaldi episode that isn't casually cruel or obnoxiously cantankerous. A wholehearted FIVE STARS from a lifelong (i.e., 45 years) Whovian who's missed the joyful Doctor terribly.  Welcome back!!!",1451088000,22,208,5.933333333333334
7555907,5,B018V1ZX88,"I confess, I am not really a fan of River Song so the announcement of her character returning did not thrill me. However, this Christmas special was a very pleasant surprise.

The difference of course, is Peter Capaldi being the Doctor this time round. (This is no way denigrates Matt Smith, by the way. He and River were cute together but I never got the sense of the Epic Love they were supposed to share.) River works much better with a Doctor closer to her own age and much more able to stand up to her incredible will. We all know by now that Capaldi's Doctor is extremely formidable, so it is entertaining to watch the two of them interact together.

Husbands of River Song starts out on a snowy planet celebrating Christmas. The Doctor, unsurprisingly after the events of Series 9, is not in a festive mood at all, despite the Tardis' best efforts. He is contacted by an intense little guy (Matt Lucas) who has been sent out to a meeting with a surgeon. By mistake, he gets the Doctor, who seems to go along just to escape Christmas carolers.

It turns out the Doctor has been recruited into a gang run by his 'wife', River Song,  on a mission to steal a diamond implanted in yet another husband's head. (Greg Davies) River does not know who the Doctor is and the Doctor gets an unfiltered view of his wife's doings when he's not around. Alex Kingston is her usual mad cap, sneakily clever self and Capaldi gets the chance to be amusingly annoyed at her. Turns out River has several husbands running around. There are a lot of comedic moments with lines of great banter between River and the Doctor. I think my favorite scene is the Doctor, supposedly seeing the interior of the Tardis for the very first time, launching into an impassioned soliloquy of its greatness. A true laugh out loud moment.

Most of the episode is comedic but, surprisingly, turns extremely poignant and bittersweet toward the end. That unexpected turn lifted this Christmas special beyond fluff for me. Writer Steven Moffat has done himself proud this entire season. From previous year's Christmas special, Last Christmas, throughout this entire year of series 9, this has been his best Doctor Who writing ever. It is great to see him back on track again.

I really enjoyed this episode. Capaldi and Kingston together are worth the price. They make the show.

P.S. Bought my disk last week. Just for the record, there is no commentary on this one, for whatever reason. Just an FYI.",1451088000,35,2464,4.6247139588100685
7555908,5,B018V1ZX88,"River Song is back! That alone is worth a few stars.  They are reunited when the doctor is accidentally called upon to help a giant robot with a humanoid head, a king's head in fact, who has a famous diamond lodged in his brain. River Song is his wife and wants a surgeon to remove the diamond, regardless of consequences.
Oddly, River doesn't recognize him, even though he gives her hints'
All that happens early and the story grows from there. Contains some good dialogue which the doctor delivers a bit better than usual (Capaldi hasn't won me over yet).
Enjoy.",1451088000,4,564,4.584158415841584

River Song is one of the more interesting, strong female characters you'll encounter in Seasons 8-9-10 (Clara the companion, is greatly missed, Missy and A'Shilda, all very interesting characters). But, if you like the Doctor, you'll probably get cold chills when you hear him say ""Hello, Sweety"" to River Song in this episode, a very fitting cherry on top of a turbulent 9th season.",1498176000,3,562,4.854166666666667

If you're a fan of Dr. River Song, then you'll love this quirky special. I won't give any 'Spoilers!' but the storyline is entertaining, heartbreaking, touching, and every other emotion we've all come to expect from the stories of the Doctor and his companions.

The bonus features are also entertaining, although I don't think they added anything extra that wasn't originally shown in theaters after the movie had played.

7555979,4,B018V1ZX88,It's a fine show and this is a fine addition to the canon.

7555986,5,B018V1ZX88,"Excellent wind-up of the unfinished love story between the Doctor and River Song.  I'm thrilled that Alex Kingston returned to finish the story. I always hated that the whole 'Doctor/River Song' saga was left hanging. Not any more.

The actual primary plot of ""The Husbands of River Song"" is the ongoing love story between the Doctor and River Song. The rest is really secondary and pretty much just filler.

We've been watching their love develop since River Song was first introduced in Season 3 (""Silence in the Library"" and ""Forest of the Dead""). It's a good idea to re-watch those two episodes again prior to viewing ""The Husbands of River Song"" to refresh your memory of the circumstances involved.

""The Husbands of River Song"" completes their amazing love story  simply sublimely. Not to give anything away; but I was thrilled to finally understand the depth of the Doctor's and River Song's love for one another.

Hurray! and thank you Stephen Moffat (and others) for this wonderful resolution to an amazing love story.",1467158400,9,1028,4.9476744186046515

This is a review of the DVD itself, not a comment on the episode. At least on this initial release, the disc has the show in a degraded format with Horizontal scan lines constantly distracting the viewer from the episode itself. These horizontal scan lines give the episode a 240p visual quality, like watching a low quality VHS recording from thirty years ago or more, without the random noise.

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD until BBC Worldwide corrects the issues...!

7556053,5,B018V1ZX88,"Christmas Day 5343. We see the TARDIS on a city street, sprinkled with snow. And in a true Ebenezer Scrooge fashion, the Doctor has pinned a sign to the front door: ""Carol Singers Will be Criticized."" That doesn't stop the hapless Nardole from knocking on the TARDIS door. His employer is looking for a surgeon.

The Doctor goes along, of course, following Nardole to a genuine flying saucer. He's been summoned by King Hydroflax's wife to operate on her husband.  She doesn't recognize the Doctor in his new regeneration, but he knows her. Yep, it's River Song. Sassy and Sexy and Thieving in a big way. How fun for the Doctor to be along when the heist goes bad.

This Christmas Special originally aired on 12/25/15.  It is chock full of good humor, from laugh out loud to the subtle. Did you notice when River empties a duffle bag, including tossing aside a red fez? The show is little less than 60 minutes (due to commercial time). But what a lot of story it crams into an hour. A love story as well as an action flick. The DVD/BluRay is presented in 16:9 aspect ratio with 5.1 surround sound. English subtitles are available for the show and for the two Special Features.

Special Features:
....1.  ""The Adventures of River Song"" (10 minutes) This featurette is narrated by Nina Tousaint-White, who plays Mels in the Sixth Season episode ""Let's Kill Hitler"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Sixth-Series/dp/B005M2A4D4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Complete Sixth Series</a>&nbsp;). Mels regenerates into the Alex Kingston we know and love, though her name is still Melody Pond.
Commentators in this special feature include Steven Moffat (lead writer) and Alex Kingston (plays River).  Moffat says, ""We're about to stand with the Doctor and see what River is like when she doesn't know he's looking.""
....2.  ""Doctor Who Extra"" (31 minutes) Narrated by Matt Lucas, who plays Nordole. Commentators include Nordale, Steven Moffat, Peter Capaldi (plays the Doctor), Alex Kingston, Greg Davies (plays Hydroflax) and Roy Holman (costume designer).
Capaldi says, ""Working with snow is amazing. Because as soon as it starts to fall, your body believes it. Even though it's really made up of tiny compressed little pieces of paper.... Your body start to think it really is snow and you start to get cold.""

One of the best comic romps of the year! I hope they keep figuring out ways to bring River Song back.

7556063,5,B018V1ZX88,"I have been a Doctor Who fan since the early 1970s and will be as long as the BBC is smart enough to keep it alive.  This was not one of my top choices for the best of Doctor Who, but as a rabid fan, I will take anything that I can get.  It was great to see River Song back in action even if she was a little confusing to me with he relationship to the Doctor.  Did she know him all along or did she not?  I am not particularly happy that this might be the last of Peter Capaldi, just as I had finally gotten used to his characterization of the Doctor.",1457049600,,552,3.773913043478261

7556066,3,B018V1ZX88,"I was actually a bit underwhelmed by this special, mainly because I happen to feel that River's story was properly ended during the Matt Smith era. But primarily the timing of this episode was exceedingly poor coming only 3 weeks (for viewers) after the amazing and emotional finale to Series 9. Odds are there will be people watching this right after the Series 9 trilogy, either on this standalone release or in the Complete Series 9 box set. DO NOT DO SO. Both in tone and in character interactions it is jarring and will be a hard pill to swallow if you're still crying after seeing how Clara's story ends. There is a place for this type of story, but they really needed to put more space between the finale and this episode and certainly didn't need to do a ""love of his life"" story right after doing a ""love of his life story"". Taken on its own merits ... I felt nothing and I thought the episode veered into the too silly at times. If you are a Clara-hater then by all means enjoy this. If you felt the Doctor got too dark in Series 9, even though it produced some of the most amazing television of 2015 as a result, then this might be right up your alley. Personally, though, the infamous Sleep No More was more entertaining. The three stars are primarily due to Capaldi's pure charisma, an actually pretty funny opening joke involving the TARDIS and one scene where the Doctor gets to act out something he's seen companions do for 52 years.",1454544000,,1449,4.430711610486892
7556067,5,B018V1ZX88,"I simply cannot wait to pre-order this DVD!!!! No spoilers, but I can tell you as a dedicated fan of River Song, I cried tears of both joy and laughter. Moffat has done it once again; he has created an episode full of memories and brilliance and beautiful desolation. You will not regret buying this episode so you can watch it for years to come. No words can describe how awestruck I was after watching it...",1451952000,6,409,4.394736842105263
7556068,5,B018V1ZX88,"The Husband of River Song is a outstanding stand alone episode
Getting Alex Kingston to return as River Song is a massive bump too

There are small weird problems with it overall
But, it also has some of the coolest easter eggs like a character wiping out a wallet with photos of every Doctor to Date (minus Capaldi really cool touch)  You also realize that the Doctor isn't as reliable as he thinks he is
River Song makes very interesting comments regarding this and it's true and works
It made me think of Torchwood: Children of Earth when  Gwen Cooper was hiding in a dark basement asking why  Captain Jack's The Doctor don't come and save all the children and ""us""
This is the first time the Capaldi version of the Doctor meets River but River doesn't realize it's him
What does The Husband of River Song  have to do with X-Mas since it debut Christmas night
Not much really the holiday aspect is pushed far back (It's mostly a oddball heist mixed with a chase)
The biggest draw is the organic chemistry between these two it works
After watching this i wanted to see more of them together on a semi regular  basis
Not gonna spoil any of the episode it's worth going out of your way to see
This is the final chapter of Doctor/River Song story in a sense (Hopefully not though)

If you are a Who fan this is a must see!  10/10",1451433600,20,1328,4.348178137651822

Peter Capaldi is such an incredible talent, he seems like a Shakespearean actor in several scenes, and then is sarcastic and silly in the next scenes. Best ""Hello, Sweetie!"" ever heard in the series. Wish they had kept him on for longer, but I suppose the BBC had to cave in eventually.",1518048000,,432,4.697368421052632
