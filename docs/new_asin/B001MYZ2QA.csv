Nick and the guys performed in Atlanta like a real musicians who demonstrate who are the real band of the progressive metal right now!!
Congratulations and thanks for include ""FALL ON YOU"".",1237593600,2,208,4.805555555555555
3704191,5,B001MYZ2QA,"Redemption are simply awesome! This DVD proves it. The songs are intense and burning and the lyrics cut like a razor right to the soul. The guitar duets smoke and the arrangements are beyond control!  I really love these guys. They have the amazing potential to become equally as potent as Dream Theater with a twist of their own style. Ray Alder's voice has never sounded better. They play many of my favorite tracks such as ""Sapphire"" and ""The Death Of Faith And Reason"". Not only do you get this superb show with this DVD but you also get a surprise tour movie set to an unreleased instrumental track that is very, very good. The guys get pretty hilarious and insane on the tour. Lots of other famous guests attend the shows. Mike Portnoy throws a birthday cake in Ray Alder's face! Plus you get the video for ""Bleed Me Dry"" which is very cool. AND you also get a CD of the show. This pakage is a real bargain!",1237075200,8,913,4.370588235294117

8322585,2,B001MYZ2QA,"This was John Gilbert's {JG} first ""all talking"" feature film but it was was fraught with problems from the ""get- go"". When  previewed by  MGM brass  and JG they were so unhappy with that cut that they had it  partially reshot  with Lionel Barrymore directing the reshoot - the first director was Fred Niblo.  However even after all this effort JG was appalled by the finished product and  successfully lobbied MGM to have it shelved until his second ""talkie' was released. Unfortunatley that one turned out to be a total disaster - ""His Glorious Night"" in which his breathless impassioned "" I Love You's"" to  frozen  faced Catherine Dale Owen were greeted with laughter from his formerly worshiping public.

 ""Redemption"" is a grim ""downer""  of a picture with JG giving a extremely variable performance. Playing  a self destructive gambling  alcoholic {a portent of his future real life self- destruction} who wants to disappear and he does so that his  wife, family and friends believe that he is dead. The film is stagebound and filmed with almost no closeups . JG  is  clearly ill  at ease with  his character  and  dialogue . Much of the film has him just sitting around getting drunk while pontificating  about his and the world's flaws and warts to his gypsey girlfriend. Some of his dialogue is beautifully spoken  and much of it is over pronunciated  stillted and not realilistic.  His suicide and death scene is fairly well done but after the drab and dreary proceeding's it is quite  frankly  a relief !

  Eleanor Boardman  {the  wife} and Renee Adoree { the mistress} both  near  the end of their MGM contracts are the lackluster  leading ladies who add  little to their roles  and  both are obviously uncomfortable with speaking dialogue and Ms. Adoree is not looking her best - she appears quite overweight . Conrad Nagel in support of JG give a nice understated performance. Contrary to legend there  is nothing wrong with JG's voice , it's fine but in his first sound feature  he is not yet a confident  or knowledgable  enough actor to know how to  frame his acting style in the new sound picture medium. His directors and the screenplay give him  little help. It seems like he is 1/2 a silent film  actor  -  overdoing his physical gestures to the camera and 1/2  a  ""talkie performer' - speaking the dialogue but not in a natural way .  JG's performance is not helped by  excessive grimacing as if he is ""nervous as hell"" .

 ""Redemption"" and ""His Glorious Night"" were panned in contemporary film  reviews  and were  complete box office failures and JG's career would never recover and drop into box office limbo. This  early pre-code tries hard, JG  tries hard but  the dreary screenplay, lackluster direction and  ineffective  performances  make it pretty much  subpar at all levels and I give it 2 stars for trying but not succeeding.",1447027200,4,2857,4.751028806584362
8322586,3,B001MYZ2QA,"I wanted to love this DVD, but the production is poor. Redemption's music, on the other hand, is excellent.",1437264000,,107,4.684210526315789
8322587,5,B001MYZ2QA,"Redemption is a rare gem. I've been a huge Ray Alder fan from all his years with Fates Warning and while all the musicians in the band are fantastic, He brings it all together with his signature style I've come accustomed to over the years. He just has a great voice. The guitar playing and song writing are top notch and not to be outdone in the genre save for maybe Dream Theater(you knew that was coming). I love them too. To see them play these songs live is an experience not to be missed in my opinion. Guitar player and multi-intrumentalist Nick Van Dyk(hope I spelled that correctly) writes most of the songs and instrumentation for the band and is one of the great underdogs in the progressive metal scene. I hope this band soon gets the respect it deserves. Highly recommended",1425168000,,786,4.503496503496503
8322588,4,B001MYZ2QA,Group has improved since this 2007 show.  Highly recommend Live from the Pit 2012 show,1422316800,,86,4.733333333333333
8322589,5,B001MYZ2QA,"This DVD captures a great live performance by one of the best bands in modern Progressive Metal.  Every member of the band nails their performance, they appear to be having a blast doing so, which makes the video that much more enjoyable.  The bonus features are more interesting than usual for concert DVDs, and include some hilarious footage of offstage antics.  Highly recommended to fans of this great band.",1263772800,,411,4.927536231884058

8322591,5,B001MYZ2QA,"I happen to know about this band from youtube while searching for videos of my fav band Dreamtheater.

The track Suffocating Silence just blew me away..and I bought this DVD immediately... great video and audio recording of the band concert..the closes that I could get to Redemption...",1242259200,3,286,5.085106382978723
8322592,5,B001MYZ2QA,"This DVD is a near perfect production. The band performs an outstanding set. The sound is phenomenal and the video great. Anyone who loves live, heavy music should see this show. They feature one of the best rhythm sections you will see/hear. Buy the CDs and support the band!

After having watched this DVD several dozen times... Get It!",1240185600,2,338,4.728813559322034
8322593,5,B001MYZ2QA,"Essential for any prog metal library. Redemption nail a killer show at Prog Power and that performance is captured with a great live shoot, and impressive sound quality, with bonus material every proghead will not want to miss.

I was anxious that this might not be a great production, aurally or visually, but that quickly was forgotten as soon as I hit play. The mix is near perfect for this type of venue, and the camera work is personal enough that you feel like you are at the gig.

Ray is sublime as always, the darker character his voice has taken on is rich and impassioned. As big a fan as I am of his jaw-dropping debut on No Exit (20 years ago!), we both have aged, and I find I prefer his style and tone now more than ever. For many of us that have grown up with his incredible voice over the years, I'm probably not the first to draw the parallel of ""fine wine"".

Nick, Bernie, Sean, Greg and Chris tear through the set with amazing skill. If you want perfect rendition of the recording, you won't find it, nor should you look be looking for it. The human element adds power and depth to the performance that would be missed in a note-for-note recital.

The bonus features on the DVD push this into 5-star territory for me. There are some absolutely great captures (Portnoy face-caking Ray for his birthday on stage) backstage goofiness that shows what a great time they had on the road, and some stuff for the archives. The stand out for me is the still of Jim Matheos sitting on a couch with Frank Aresti and Ray. Ray is wearing a DT shirt. I distinctly remember, 20 years ago, Jim and Frank were on Headbanger's Ball interviewing for the Perfect Symmetry release ... and Jim was wearing a Dream Theater shirt. I had no idea who DT was (nor did many at that time), and the rest, they say, is history.

All of this to the backdrop of a previously unreleased 11-minute instrumental epic; what more could you ask for?",1239408000,6,1929,4.392156862745098
