2896250,2,B000TCFTD2,"I wanted to buy the P90X system but was a little nervous.  I thought I would start with Power 90.  I had just finished a 30 day adventure boot camp so I thought this program would be a perfect follow up.  I assumed the four phases meant four different workouts.  Boy was I wrong....  You do the same workouts every other day for two weeks for phase 1 and phase 2 is the same just with additional weights.  I was bored to death by the end of the first week!!  Tony kept messing up on his reps and would do something with his right side and call it his left and then say his right two seconds later.  I could feel the workouts working and the ab workout killed me, but after doing the SAME workout over and over and over I just couldn't do it anymore.  The mistakes in the video drove me nuts!  I should have just bought the P90X and sucked it up.....",1226880000,13,849,4.0602409638554215
2896251,4,B000TCFTD2,"My wife bought this for us in 2001 on VHS tapes, these DVD's look similiar. There are two sections (Sculpt and Cardio) in two parts (a session for level 1+2 on first tape, 3+4 on second). I liked this program because the work-out stresses a gradient and the longest session was do-able in about 45 minutes. I was able to ""master"" 1+2 in about 5 weeks, then do the rest. I lost weight (~20 pounds) and gained substantial stamina working out 6 out of 7 days a week (less around holidays). Consistency is, of course, important as is diet. The routines will make you sweat (especially early on) and provide a good, well rounded work-out. I found the stretching exercises were particularly beneficial for muscle soreness. Having a set of dumbbells is necessary although I believe Beach body sells an elastic exercise band also. This is a good program for ""getting in shape"" but I also believe 3+4 would be a benefit for anyone wanting to stay in shape.",1200355200,18,947,4.609467455621302
2896252,5,B000TCFTD2,"This system of nutrition and exercise has totally changed my body.  I have lost 30 pounds in my 11 weeks on the program so far.  To get maximum results, you must commit yourself to the full 90 days experience.  It has been wonderful for me and I love getting the compliments.  And yes, diet and exercise really do work!!  The exercises are simple, yet very intense.  The eating plan, which is extremely important to fast results, includes vegetables, fruits, lean proteins and good fats.  The system comes with detailed instructions on what to eat when, and how to exercise.  The only equipment you'll need are some dumbbells.

There are no fancy dance moves and the music leaves a little bit to be desired, but the workouts are very challenging and will definitely burn the fat right off of you if you do them with intensity.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is ready to make a change in lifestyle and get in the best shape possible.  Some people repeat the 90 days if they have not reached their desired weight.  This could get repetitive to me, so I will order other workout products from beachbody.  I just wanted to give a true account of my experience that this system will work if you work!",1192752000,36,1210,4.546296296296297
2896253,5,B000TCFTD2,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this DVD and am going to wear the poor thing out!  I've been doing this program for over 10 years and have never had a problem with any of the exercises.  (I have lower back problems).  I have also modified a couple of the exercises (I can't do jumping jacks because of my back so instead I'll run in place).  When I first started this program I saw immediate results, especially in the hips (I'm a girl).  I have never found any exercise that targets and slims down hips but this was amazing how fast my hips slimmed down.  A great, all body workout with little impact and jarring motion.  The only complaint is that I wanted to purchase this DVD and send to my sister but Beachbody doesn't have it anymore.  Amazon wants $45.00 for a new copy.  How utterly greedy.  I'll find it somewhere else.",1433808000,,815,4.337748344370861

2896256,3,B000TCFTD2,"I do like the workout, however both my husband (who is not overweight) and I (who is pushing 200 pounds and 5""8"") did it together and after the 90 days neither of us had lost a pound or one inch. I did a modified version but he did the full workout. The discipline of doing regular daily exercise was a great habit to get into so for that I did benefit although I was disappointed to not get any results/change on a physical level.",1411862400,3,431,4.142857142857143
2896257,4,B000TCFTD2,"I starting this working after losing 30 of 50 lbs from walking. I had plateaued and, though I weighed less, was quite flabby. I had never dong strength training in my life - I used to be a runner and prefer cardio. Other workout videos have been overwhelming but this one made me feel like I could do it. Phase 1-2 does a great job of easing you in and teaching proper form. Phase 3-4 adds a few more exercises and allows opportunity to max out on pushups and such. You can challenge yourself with this video! By about 6-7 weeks I was ready for a new challenge, but could not have done it without this video first. Some people can jump right into something crazy like insanity - I'm not one of them. I only lost about 5 lbs, but went down 2 dress sizes...so my suggestion would be not to weight yourself until the end.",1408838400,6,818,4.2165605095541405
2896258,5,B000TCFTD2,This is a begginers workout video. I checked this out after I seen p90x recommended this for begginers. Great for starters.,1407110400,2,123,4.904761904761905
2896259,5,B000TCFTD2,"This workout is great for those who are looking to sweat, but not spend one hour in the process.  The workout includes routines you get used to but it is up to you to rev up the intensity.  The sculpting working is tremendous.",1404432000,3,226,4.232558139534884
2896260,5,B000TCFTD2,"This is perfect for me, it's effective without being too intense!  It's a great foundation for someone who is not already in great shape.  This workout is a big reason why I lost 22 pounds in 4 months!  I have never gotten results like this with any other workout DVD (and I have tried A LOT of them in the last 20 years)!!",1396310400,,323,4.095238095238095
2896261,5,B000TCFTD2,Used this program after a shoulder operation. In the beginning modified a lot but stuck to it and it helped to get back in shape.,1395619200,2,129,4.2
2896262,5,B000TCFTD2,"One year ago I found myself on Amazon reading reviews on P90X after watching the infomercial. I was unhappy with my body and my life in general and knew that I was at the breaking point. Something needed to change. I was the fattest I ever was in my life. My energy levels were rock bottom. I lived off of energy drinks. Clothes didn't fit and I gotten to the point where I couldn't buy clothes off the rack any more. It is depressing having to hunt for your size only to find that the store probably only ordered a few in your size and a bunch of other people in the same predicament beat you to it. That infomercial resonated in me. Deep down inside I wanted to be just like those happy smiling people with the before and after pictures.

The advice on the Amazon reviews was basically, yeah P90X is tough and if you are really out of shape you can do it, but you should consider the predecessor Power 90. After reading that a number of times it sunk in and I bought Power 90 instead. I did the workouts for a week and then like so many people I abandoned it and wallowed in self pity for 6 months. Once again I felt that breaking point. Those DVDs were sitting right by the DVD player and I just decided that I couldn't take this any more. I pushed play. I couldn't keep up at all, but I stayed with them for the entire workout. The same with the next day and every day after that. We all seem to think the fat is just going to melt off. We all want to lose weight or lose fat fast but the reality is that it took a lot of time to add it and it is going to take some time to reverse that. I lost on average 1 or 2 pounds a week. Sometimes I didn't lose anything. After 90 days I went from 252 pounds to 222. I felt fantastic. Everybody I knew commented how great I looked.

So how hard is it? I was really out of shape. That's an understatement. I could barely do one pushup. I used the pink band instead of weights. To get through the workouts I often had to do the pushups on my knees and when I couldn't keep up with a lot of the jumping I just walked in place. But no matter what I never gave up and each week I got stronger and leaner. They talk you through such things to keep you moving and doing what you can do. My goal was to keep up with the people in the video 100% by the end of the 90 days and sure enough I got there. Every 30 days just as I felt like, ""hey I this aint so bad I can almost keep up"" they made it tougher. The challenge pushed me harder to succeed.

After completing Power 90 and P90X my friends tease me I am half the man I used to be. I can see my abs now. I feel fantastic. People may wonder if the cost is worth it. All I can say to that is how much are you willing to pay for a gym membership, a personal trainer, and a dietitian? Read the books thoroughly and adhere to them and push play every day and you too will have your very own before and after pictures. Plus there is the support community of beachbody customers and coaches.

My last bit of advice is to not go cheap and try to get this program at a steep discount. If you get it on ebay and it is some illegal copy or even if it isn't, if it doesn't play as seems to happen a lot you are left without recourse. Buy it through Amazon, Beachbody, or through a Beachbody coach.

The only way this program doesn't work is if you ignore the books, eat like crap and watch your favorite sitcom while drinking a six pack instead of working on your six pack. Decide. Commit. Succeed!",1386979200,27,3474,3.9784791965566715
2896263,5,B000TCFTD2,"I love Tony's power 90 exercise system. it is great if you are not in good shape to go for p90x (I am not). I used this workout years ago but my old dvd stopped working, so I bought a new one.

2896264,5,B000TCFTD2,"I reviewed this video before I began the routines. I said this is easy. When I started doing the leg routine, I thought I was going to die! I felt sore for four days! This video will definately get you into shape!",1377907200,,213,4.095238095238095
2896265,4,B000TCFTD2,"A little slower than I expected, but the effort required subtly builds up and by the end of the tape I'm sweating.

Tony is corny and funny, so the whole experience is more enjoyable than routine gym exercise.

2896268,4,B000TCFTD2,"I was an extreme couch potato before I got this. Even jumping into level 1 was a challenge for me at first but I tried to keep up with the videos and push myself and started seeing results immediately. Clothes started fitting better and inches started falling off in just a couple of weeks. I will say, I recommend investing in some dumb bells rather than using the resistance bands. It's much easier to make the transitions and the resistance is consistent throughout the entire exercise. It's much harder to judge how much weight you can handle using the resistance bands.",1367539200,7,574,4.693069306930693
2896269,5,B000TCFTD2,This is just the product I needed to get back in the swing of working out. Tony Horton's Power 90 Beachbody In-Home Boot Camp is both easy enough and hard as you want to make it.,1342224000,,178,3.9722222222222223
2896270,5,B000TCFTD2,"I am writing this review having only gone through the first 1.5 weeks of the program and being so impressed that I feel the need to post an initial review. I spent the first week doing the level 1/2 sculpt and cardio DVDs then moved on to level 3/4 which I am surprised I am able to do. People asked me what I am doing to lose weight and have noticed a difference in my appearance to where they made comments only one week into the program! I can feel my body changing and clothes fitting better already, and I have more energy. I enjoy the workouts and definitely recommend this program! I have not followed the diet plan but have been mindful of what I am eating and have been making healthy choices. I'll post later on in the program to update my results. A must for people serious about doing something to change their health!",1332547200,5,830,4.292993630573249
2896271,5,B000TCFTD2,"This is an amazing entry level program to build up your stamina, strength, and physical fitness.

I started this program in July 2011 and after completing two rounds I am now onto P90X and almost done with my first round of that.

The process that Power90 takes you through is amazing. You start off slow, but by the end you are pushing yourself and seeing such progress it will amaze you.

Tony's philosophy on fitness is amazing- he takes care of the whole body.

Power90 is a great program intended for beginners and if you want to eventually work your way up to P90X or P90X2 then this is the program to start off with. In 90 days or after two rounds (the second round I did the last phases and then did the mastery series of the Power90) like me you will be amazed at the results. I am down over 100lbs and this program has given me the push to keep going.

Give Power90 and the Nutrition plan a chance and you will be amazed at the results.",1332374400,13,946,4.233333333333333

I had shifted over the years from overall workouts to just running.  My son (a P90X and Insanity person) gave me the DVD's for the transition away from running.  The video presents a classic, personal trainer workout ... complete with stretching, breaks, and time for a drink of water.  There are two alternating workouts (aerobics/abs and weights), one for each day, which seem to integrate to work the whole body while eliminating soreness and stiffness.  Yes, it's an early Horton video with simple production values, and can be boring if one lets it be that.  But, used every day, it results in serious conditioning.",1496275200,,778,4.7611940298507465
8208593,5,B000TCFTD2,I have used the first Power90 video on and off 2X each year for 3 months each use. This is still the best simple easy to use whole body workout available. I bought this one for a nephew who wanted a good workout for his offseason.,1481673600,,230,4.021739130434782
8208594,5,B000TCFTD2,I like the Power 90 workout.  As a beginner it teaches me how to use the weights properly and since I am working on it at home I can pause as I need to.  It also has harder workouts that I can do as I get stronger and more proficient with the weights.  I also like the abs routine and cardio workouts.  All of the workouts I have done so far a challenging.  When you are doing the sculpt portion you will need weights or an elastic band which can be ordered from Beach body.
