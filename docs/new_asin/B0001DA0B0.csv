1990051,5,B0001DA0B0,"Delighted to have this product after watching the cut versions on cable.  It has been on my wish list for a long time, but eleven seasons, even with no extras cost a bit.  I am happy with the whole set, but wish that they could have listed the episode titles on the cases... either inside or out, but I belong to a MASH Facebook group, and they helped me find a list of all the episodes by season and I printed them out and slipped them inside the plastic sleeve.",1518307200,,463,4.133333333333334
1990052,5,B0001DA0B0,MASH is like a warm blanket from my childhood.. the comfort these wonderful characters brings is indescribable.  If I could watch one show for the rest of my life it would be MASH.,1518220800,,180,4.454545454545454

1990057,5,B0001DA0B0,Love this show! The picture quality is amazing and better than when we watched the show on cable. My only regret is that the DVDs do not come in a larger box set. Would have been nicer to be able to display them on a shelf or something.,1516838400,,236,3.9375
1990058,5,B0001DA0B0,It is fabulous.  I wore out my previous DVD series of Mash and am happy the new series has a plastic cover for each season.  The previous one had slots to slide the DVD's in and thus sliding them in and out caused scratchers on the DVD's .,1516838400,,239,3.9583333333333335

1990061,4,B0001DA0B0,"One of my favorite series. My one complaint is that there is no ""play all"" option on each of the discs. So after each episode you have to go back to the main menu, scroll to the next episode, then click to go to the summary, then click again play it. Kind of a pain for classic shows like this where you know them all by heart and play them in the background a lot. Not to mention the episodes are short so you have to stop what your doing, find the remote, and play the next episode every 30 min. I know, I know... there are worst things in life, just thought I'd let people know.
Other than that the video quality is good, the DVD quality is decent, and the packaging is perfectly acceptable.",1516320000,,694,4.110294117647059
1990062,5,B0001DA0B0,"The image quality is unimaginable, that's why they invested in 8.3gb DVDs I guess. Really nice presentation, and all closed captioned / subtitled! Actually meant as a gift but with reason of making sure the quality was high I started watching it myself and then my brother joined and it became a gift to myself...",1516060800,,313,4.709090909090909
1990063,5,B0001DA0B0,"This a great set with the added bonus of including not only the original movie but also the final 2hr episode. If you loved the show, you're not going to find a better deal. Trust me, I looked around quite a bit and this was the best deal ever!.",1515974400,,245,4.020408163265306

1990090,4,B0001DA0B0,"The only complaints that I have is that the disks are not held in a decent manner/ the materials seem cheap. My other complaint is that why do some of the disks have a few episodes that hang or refuse to play in the middle of the episode? I've noticed this befor on other series complilations that I've purchased and Babylon 5 is one of the worst. Plays fine the first few times and then .......
But it was a pleasure to be able to see the entire series again and it hasn't lost anything over the years..",1515456000,,504,4.153061224489796

1990092,5,B0001DA0B0,MASH is a great television series. One of the best shows of the 70s imo. The picture is very clear and you can even turn off the laugh track which is a big plus.,1514592000,,161,3.764705882352941
1990093,5,B0001DA0B0,My man is gonna be soooo happy when he gets these for Christmas. He loves this show.,1514073600,,84,4.0
1990104,4,B0001DA0B0,"Yes, bits like when Klinger tells Hawkeye on the phone how Syngman Rhee (the head of democratic South Korea) is trying to gobble up land at the peace talks. They ignore the fact that North Korea in fact started the whole Korean War. Old Soviet documents testify heavily to the fact that North Korea planned the invasion of South Korea (and thus starting the war) for a long time. The finale has great acting like the (also well-directed) regularly produced eps of Mash though the actors look and act a little different in this film (they act more like they're in a theatrical film than they did in the weekly hit series).

PS For more on the old Soviet documents see book (""Forgotten War Remembered, Korea""  by Bill Shinn) also here at amazon.",1513987200,,743,4.578947368421052

1990106,5,B0001DA0B0,"I got this set as a gift for my mother, who loved MASH.  Turns out, my dad is also a pretty big fan himself.

The set contained every season and the MASH movie as well.  Great if you haven't purchased any seasons yet.  It might be cheaper than purchasing missing seasons if you've only brought one or two thus far.  Unlike some of the other sets I've seen, it included the MASH movie.",1513728000,,384,4.205479452054795

1990146,5,B0001DA0B0,Love them!,1508284800,,10,4.5
1990147,4,B0001DA0B0,"It is a documented fact that Kim II Sung (of North Korea) pestered mass-murderer Joe Stalin for permission to invade South Korea in 1950 and thus start the Korean War. In 1994 Boris Yeltsin presented this highly documented evidence (from old Soviet archives) to the then head of South Korea. Now, on Mash you will never even once hear of Kim II Sung or the fact that he started the Korean War--or that, more generally, North Korea did for that matter. As long as you can keep remembering that NK was the causes of the entire war you can enjoy Mash.

PS Watch in the final ep (Goodbye, farewell, Amen) when Klinger gets on the phone to Hawkeye and the former mentions how Syngman Rhee (of South Korea) is trying to gobble up land at the peace talks. TV's Mash would heavily demonize the victim-nation of South Korea very badly at times but just about never the 100% causing nation of North Korea as well or instead of. The Mash movie demonized Rhee just a little too much also. Book ( ""The Forgotten War Remembered, Korea"" by Bill Shinn) here at amazon has more on Yeltsin and the documents he presented.",1507248000,,1103,4.487562189054726

When I ordered, it appeared from the ""People Also Ordered"" section toward the bottom of the page, that the last show - Goodbye, Farewell and Amen - wasn't included in the complete series so I ordered that too unnecessarily because that episode is included in the complete series. Watching the show in 1972, I never noticed how really loud it was - Hot Lips shrieking and fighting with Frank, Hawkeye ranting, noisy pratfalls, etc.",1503532800,,606,4.836538461538462

1990235,5,B0001DA0B0,"I love this series, and was heartbroken when it was no longer on Netflix. I finally gave in and purchased it on DVD. The DVD's are good quality and the packaging is also pretty good. After I opened them up there were only two discs that were actually popped out of place, they each had a couple scratches on them from getting jostled around, but the discs are well made and there were not even any issues with the video even though the discs were a little scratched. Well worth the money, a nice long term investment. My only dislike of the series is I'm lazy and want to watch all the episodes on the disc in a row, so having to go back to the main menu at the end of every episode is kind of a pain in the butt. I just wish they had that lovely ""Watch all episodes"" option on the main menu!!",1496361600,,793,4.057324840764331

Sadly I got into MASH when it was the last episode and man what an ending. Even though I did not see the show from beginning to end, the ending left an impact on me and I started to watch it in syndication and glad I did, the show was awesome. There two episodes that was a tear jerker, the one where the original Company Commander was transferred back to the states and he perished on the way there. The new company commander who had a role earlier in the show took over and he was good as well but was more on running a tight company and the last episode where they all got to go home and there was an easter egg in it. Some may have not paid attention to it when the show began you always saw the helicopter coming but never leaving and in the final episode you saw the helicopter leaving It brought tears to my eyes that a show that was about a company doing it's job during the Korean War and batting out the laughter. I am glad to have the collection and watch it at my leisure.",1494115200,,1090,4.027649769585254

1990285,4,B0001DA0B0,"This is one of my favorite shows. It truly is a timeless classic and a must have for anyone who appreciates humor. While there are a lot of episodes which are just entertainment fluff, this series delves into a number of social and ethical issues which are still relevant today. At the time of the original run, it was considered revolutionary television. Many late Gen Xers such as myself and early Millennials grew up watching reruns as often as 4 or more times a day.
Younger viewers should not be discouraged by the age of the series. While there are occasionally cultural references which may escape younger viewers (this is why we have Google), for the most part the humor is quite timeless. As a period drama, it deals with many aspects of the Korean war which were glossed over by the news media. In fact, the film was intended to protest the Vietnam War.
At an incredible price of only $90, you are paying less than $1 per minute for one of the greatest television series ever produced.
The only reason I gave  just 4 stars is because I'm really ticked off they're just sitting on the remastered HD version.",1492214400,,1116,4.552238805970149

This set gives you every funny, thoughtful, heartwrenching episode that was ever shown AND the original movie (which is ok in my book, but NOTHING compared to the series with Alan Alda). There are a couple of the shows that I was not fond of and now I can just fast-foreword past the one I don't want to watch and keep going. Best of all, NO COMMERCIALS.

It's a d@$# shame that movies and T.V. series like this will never be made again. Can you imagine M.A.S.H. the TV series being made withe the 'reality' TV stars from today? (and I use the term reality tv stars VERY loosely!) I saw the TV series first and then the movie. And I sometimes was crying during the show. It showed the reality of war(without the blood and guts of today's movies and TV shows) in a way that most people can understand.

Bought this set so we could watch the last 4 seasons and the movie and have the entire series to enjoy whenever we wish. The star knocked off my review has nothing to do with the series, but with the condition that the DVDs arrived in. These come with those hinged dividers in the middle of the case so that they can put 3 or 4 disks in each case. Upon arrival many of these dividers had come out and were sliding around inside the case. In a case of instances disks had come loose and were free floating in their cases. I've only found one disk that is scratched up so far and luckily it hasn't caused any skipping, but I would have liked to see them reach me in a little better condition.",1459900800,,773,4.125827814569536

But there is a reason it lasted 11 years.  I will say though, that the show went downhill fast after radar left in season (8?).  This show really hit its stride (in my opinion) late in the first season and for the next 4 or 5 seasons after that.

The individual cases are very acceptable in their construction. This is a Great series, & now can watch any episode WITHOUT  annoying and LOUD commercial breaks!!!! Only real issue I have with this package is the lack of a ""box"" to hold the entire collection.  In order to hold the series together, I cut up the shipping box these came in and added a little packing tape. Not pretty or professional, but does the job. I know the supplier needs to make a profit, but I would gladly pay a buck or two so I wouldn't have to build a workaround for what should have already supplied. Of all the series out there you would think MASH would deserve a box?

1990958,2,B0001DA0B0,"I remember seeing this show a number of times growing up, but it never really felt like much more than light entertainment. Then again, ""Hogan's Heroes"" was a sitcom meant more to mock the World War Two-based shows of that era than to educate us about how life was really like in a German POW camp.

M*A*S*H was not as ridiculous as ""Hogan's Heroes"", but it never had any real emotional effect on me. It was a product of its era, coming out at a time when the US was ready to pull out of Vietnam- and the show felt more 1970's than 1950's, like ""Happy Days"".

In the actual Korean War, there was the ""mobile phase"" from 1950 to mid-1951, when North Korean forces nearly overran the south, then the UN intervened and conquered most of North Korea-only to be pushed back by intervening Chinese forces, back to where the country's original dividing line had been. From then until 1953, there was the ""static phase"" when there was fighting along the front, but the lines did not shift any great deal. I mention this because I cannot recall the base having to change its location, or any threat of its having to do so. Also, Korean winters can get extremely cold-but I cannot recall that mentioned in the show ever.

It would be interesting to know what any Korean War veterans thought of this show.",1443571200,,1294,4.47457627118644

1991169,3,B0001DA0B0,".Funny how you remember things differently.  I was 13 when this first came out, and everybody HAD to, was expected to like MASH...so I did.  (I think there are still the faithful lambs; the manipulated followers that believe what they are commanded to..  I had forgotten just how much they were trying to fix me!  The WORST canned laugh track in TV, and bad, constant, irritating Groucho imitations.  Liberal propaganda from the word go.  Morals, none!  American pride, none!  I didn't remember just how ""High School Play"" the whole show was.  This show was one of the first shows telling me what I was expected, commanded, and tricked into believing something.  I can't believe how easily we follow the crowd, without making our own decisions.  How easily we are manipulated. Do your OWN research...study yourself...form your own beliefs!
Critical part aside, if it weren't for the bleeding heart propaganda, there are some touching moments, and scenes (of minutes) of good acting.  No one likes war...left of right.  It is tragedy.  Lives are lost (or GIVEN) for, what in someone's opinion, is a greater cause.  But the bigoted, openly bias politics of this show robbed it of its legitimate sensitivity.  Guess I grew up...studied...read...hen formed my OWN thoughts.  Sorry guys, disappointed, but I know I've offended a lot of your followers.  You, the faithful, will still enjoy this show.",1436745600,,1394,5.0394736842105265

1991242,5,B0001DA0B0,"The M*A*S*H finale is still the most watched TV show
in history, and is still shown at least twice a year, on
various networks.
The original time allowed was 2 hrs, but when the fire
swept across the set, the writers added it into the story
and asked the network for another 30 minutes, as they
has the story for it.
And so, the Finale went to 2 1/2 hours.
But it was the last 45 minutes that most people will remember,
and still feel sad, when that chopper lifts off for the last time, and
we see BJ's message........GOODBYE.
As like all of us, the cast has aged, and we have lost Harry Morgan,
but it is difficult to understand that, when we can watch 2-4 episodes,
of the show everyday, and they never age.
I will not go into the Finale any deeper, as I would venture to say all of
us have watched it many times, and I will leave you to your own memories
of those last hours of M*A*S*H 4077's war.",1430697600,,900,4.119318181818182

1991360,4,B0001DA0B0,"Wow! Mash for hours! I started watching these DVDs and still enjoy the comedy after all these years. After watching (for hours) from the beginning, I started picking out my favorites to laugh again and even catch some of the humor and background scenes I totally missed before. I like having this complete series so I can reminisce my younger days.

Okay, how does a series about war and violence become so popular and funny too? Well, I think it's the writing and being able to take light of the (at the time) situation. Plus, Mash shows some of the real (heart-wrenching and sad) circumstances that happen with war. Even  post traumatic stress disorder (before it was named PTSD) is shown as well as other psychological effects which affect us.

Anyway, I'm just happy to have this series in my DVD collection. A decent video transfer without the (sometimes) snow/static when I first watched these shows. Since this series is pretty old now, the sound is commensurate to the original quality but, still a very clear transfer from the original filming's.",1418601600,,1055,4.81767955801105

1991385,5,B0001DA0B0,"This is a wonderful series, and even though it is a comedy, much of it is true.

This is a drama comedy, a dramedy. The characters we see may not have actually served in Korea, but in many cases, the characters are amalgamations of people who were actually over there. We could probably call this historical fiction. The best of historical fiction has a lot of truth in it.

I don't need to say much, because the people who are going to buy the complete series have already seen many of the episodes already. They, like I, know they love the series, and know they want all of the episodes in one place so that they, like I, can enjoy them at our leisure. They, like I, don't mind the artistic license. They, like I, know that there were probably some MASH units where the corpsmen had stills hidden nearby, and where they tried to get out of camp to enjoy local bars that did spring up near these portable camps, proved by one guy, temporarily in charge, that set out to prove it by moving the entire camp just for the heck of it.

If you haven't seen any MASH episodes yet, and if you're not sure if you'd like to own all eleven seasons, then try to catch a few episodes on rerun channels, or borrow a season from your local public library if they have one or more. Watch a few episodes, and I'm sure you'll be left wanting more.

I highly recommend this entire series, and the movie, to you, whether you love drama, comedy, or both.

Do note, M*A*S*H is more serious than Hogan's Heroes. Don't judge one by the other. Hogan's Heroes was 98% fiction, though some prisoners did escape, there was not a camp full of prisoners whose duty it was to do everything like they did. My dad, who served stateside during WW2, used to say, ""The Germans were not that stupid,"" but he let us watch it anyway.

But much of what you see in M*A*S*H actually did happen. There is fiction, but I'd imagine even that fiction was based in part on truth. There were practical jokers over there. There might not have been a corporal that dressed up like women around camp, but I'm sure there were men over there that wanted to, and might have worn that type of undergarment, while serving our country.

I highly recommend this series for its comedy value, and for it's look at history, albeit in a semi-fictional setting. The Four-Oh-Double-Natural, the 4077, is a place I look forward to revisiting as I watch all of these seasons over again, when I'll be able to remember watching them with my parents before Dad's death, and with Mom, afterward.",1417910400,,2526,4.419354838709677

Like many others, I'm just not a huge fan of the movie, but may still watch it occasionally... Makes a great dad gift (I picked up this deal for myself, and my mom and I split the cost on a second for Fathers Day)

The seasons themselves are fantastic. Really great to see all the episodes in order. I'm only 27 now, so I've only seen them in syndication, and I've gotten 2 really great things out of these dvds: 1. I've learned that some of the episodes I thought were from later in the series were actually quite a lot earlier on in the series, and 2. There are scenes that I have never seen in the syndication episodes that are on the episodes on the dvds so it's quite fantastic! (An example would be Season 4 Episode 'The Bus' where there's a scene added at the end where BJ and Hawkeye find the 2nd walkie talkie and have the prisoner (Soon Tek Oh) talking into it in Chinese and Frank yells out about how he's 'got the enemy on the other end!' Quite funny!

One thing I will mention though is that I tend to watch A LOT of my dvds on my laptop, and I've had 1 glitchy episode so far that would not play (starts to skip around scenes then freezes up) It's from season 1 and it's the episode called ""Edwina"" It does however play on a normal dvd player without issue! I contacted Fox, and they wanted a bunch of info and whatnot to do an exchange.. seemed like more trouble than it's worth so oh well! At least it plays elsewhere!

This disc shows the ending to the series in a very heartbreaking way,  the goodbye to friends that have endured a war together and lived, and the memory of those that didn't. Alan Alda was perfect in his role as Hawkeye, and Wayne Rogers, even though being discharged in the story line and replaced, was still very much in my thoughts. The death of Col. Blake was a very sad memory for me. I could go on and on describing all the beloved characters, but you know who they are. Watched by a record amount of viewers, Mash was much loved, and the feeling will come back watching this disc.

The cast and writers were the very best television had to offer, and kept it up week after week. Alan Alda was perfect in his role, and a lot of his lines were humor laced with hatred of the war.

I was comparing it to another MASH collection (that was cheaper) but settled on this one because of the packaging.  This has real DVD cups, not the paper sleeves that can scratch discs.  Each season was individually wrapped, and then all of them wrapped together, which made for a nice presentation to my husband (and also told me these didn't come from someone's basement, as they still had manufacturer stickers on them).  There are only a few minor issues with them:  one of the discs was mildly scratched due to how it fit in the case; sometimes the subtitles will just disappear for no reason; there is a crackling noise in some episodes in Season 7 (probably original filming noise though); and somewhere in Season 9 one of the episodes is missing like 2 chapters.

The movie's a classic, i.e., a great anti-war (Viet Nam) response to the insanity of the time. [I heartily recommend reading the original novel, since it has scenes the censors wouldn't even allow in the movie that are hilarious.]

When the movie was originally released, there were a few folks who found it offensive because of its satirical presentation on topics such as religion, casual sex and military structure. One needs to remember/understand that these issues were being significantly challenged at the time when the boomers where throwing off the shackles of Ozzie & Harriet.

Upscaled, the quality of the video is quite good if one realizes that some of the scenes were intentionally shot slightly out of focus. The sound seems fine altho I don't have a very discerning ear. The packaging per DVD is unremarkable.",1398556800,,994,4.910714285714286

1991505,4,B0001DA0B0,"This review is for the bundle of the individual seasons and the movie.  And I figure if you're considering spending $125.64 on this (price varies, but that's what it was on the day I wrote this review), you know enough about the show that I don't have to spend time introducing or analyzing it or whatever.

My complaint about the packaging is because there's no episode guide, or even a list of episodes.  The back of each box has generic copy about how funny the series is, how outlandish the situations are, etc., etc., etc.  For example, here's what it say on the box for Season 3:

""Korea, 1950.  They were a MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) unit stationed three miles from the front.  Loosely based on real-life MASH unit 8055, life at the 4077 was often a mix of horror and hilarity.  So scrub up and journey back to join the doctors and nurses that had us all in stitches: Captain ""Hawkeye"" Pierce, Captain ""Trapper"" McIntyre, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, Major Margaret Houlihan, Major Franklin Burns, Corporal ""Radar"" O'Reilly and the fashionable Corporal Max Klinger.  Spending time with the doctor has never been this much fun!""

Maybe so, but it doesn't tell me anything about what's in THIS particular set.

As a fan of TV shows on DVD - and this applies to ALL TV shows on DVD, not just this one - you don't have to sell me on the show, I already know if I want it or not.  If you're not going to include a little booklet - or even a slip of paper - with a list of episodes, put them on the back of the box instead of overhyped advertising copy that's of no value once the customer has already bought the product.

Getting back to the matter at hand - the ""official"" complete collection, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-A-S-H-Martinis-and-Medicine-Complete-Collection/dp/B000HT3P5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M*A*S*H - Martinis and Medicine Complete Collection</a>, is only a few dollars more, but I think you'd be better off buying this bundle because each season comes in its own box and the discs are better protected.",1396915200,,2092,4.925925925925926

I had contemplated just buy the Martinis and Medicine box set; then I realized that all it contained was the EXACT same dvds I already had. No sense whatsoever to paying more money for the same thing.
  This dvd set contains everything you would have gotten with the big set and there was no need to start all over again. The disc are also in standard cases instead of in cardboard sleeves like in the big collection. So major plus there as far as I am concerned. Worth the money.",1385424000,,599,4.292035398230088

There are very few series that I would even have a passing thot about purchasing. When this one came down the Daily Deal Pike, I couldn't turn it down. When I thot about buying it, there were absolutely no dissenting voices in my head.

I have yet to open any of there and watch. If there are issues with quality, like MacArthur, I shall return. And say bad things. But at this point, I am as pleased as punch to have this.",1380672000,,500,4.040404040404041

One can see character development (where there is any) and writers mistakes. The anti-war politics are very evident. Some episodes are great even today, some are really sappy. The MASH movie is really bad from our point of view.  One disc has a flaw that freezes the play.  Otherwise the quality of the discs is excellent.

1991574,5,B0001DA0B0,"All the seasons of MASH plus the film!  Grabbed it for around $80 from the Daily Special in the Gold Box.

Each season is in a separate box, so this isn't the crummy 'special edition' packaging that has many folks frustrated.  A much, MUCH better packaging deal than the other.

Not familiar with MASH?  Well, it's a comedy series that isn't quite slapstick, but more satire.  Hawkeye and the gang at the 4077 MASH unit in Korea basically cut up, play pranks, and otherwise protest the war while doing their best to save the lives of soldiers and civilians caught in the fighting.  It's VERY anti-war, so it definitely appeals to those with leftist views. But the comedy is usually light and subtle with a lot of the good old Marx brothers style of dialogue.  In fact, I think Alan Alda might be Groucho Marx in disguise!

A great deal - if it comes around again then snatch it up!",1380499200,,881,4.45625

1991604,3,B0001DA0B0,"The discs have about half that were loose in the cases, but no scratches at least on the discs themselves.

The quality of the video is much better than I had expected, and the audio is about right for this timeframe, but regardless of the system I play them on, the video and audio are out of sync.  Yes, I can adjust my receiver to compensate, but it's not a problem with my system since it's the only DVD or blu ray I've had this issue with.  I can put in any other disc and have no sync issues, just this set.  And it's every single disc so far.

The biggest complaint, though, is there is no ""play all"" option so far (through season 3 anyway).  Every episode is it's own, and you have to go up menu levels to get back to the main page to pick the next episode.  For me, there is NOTHING more irritating with a TV collection than the lack of a ""Play all episodes"" option on each disc...

I got this on a gold box deal, so the price was right, but not impressed with the quality of the product itself.

Update - the lack of a ""Play All"" option was  resolved at Season 5, and the seasons after all have that option on each disc.  The downside is that where up to that point you could use the next track button on a remote to skip the intro song and get right to the first chapter of the actual show, after season 5, it gets random.  Even on the same disc, skipping the theme song sometimes goes to the first part of the show, in others it skips to the second chapter of the show.",1379376000,,1481,4.034246575342466

So I opted for this set, even though it meant I didn't get all the extra content.  It's a great set for a true MASH fan.",1378598400,,450,3.912087912087912

I was able to obtain this great collection of DVD's on the day that Amazon offered it as their Gold Box deal.

The content, of course is great!  Classic M*A*S*H!

1991643,5,B0001DA0B0,"I have been looking to add the complete MASH series to m y collection for some time. I had looked at Amazon's special offers of the box set but was put off by the reviews regarding the packaging and how it damaged the disks. When Amazon put this collection - the individual boxed set up for a deal of the day I snatched it up, and have no regrets in doing so.

I watched MASH when it was originally released when I was young living in England. It was a show that aired on BBC2 at 9.00pm and because I was younger I did not get all of the jokes, but did enjoy the show. I stopped watching MASH after several seasons when the BBC decided to include the laughter track on its broadcasts. I hated the laughter track, the show is funny enough so we don't need these cues of when to laugh. When I heard the DVD release has the option to turn off the canned laughter I rejoiced.

So far I have watched season 1 on the DVD set and I am loving this trip back to my youth, the humor on this show works even better not. Although the quality is not fantastic and is in 4:3 aspect ratio, it is a sign of the times this show was released. The added bonus is that this set comes with the movie too, my wife (who is American born and bred) did not even know there was a movie and so we enjoyed this together with many a lol!

I would recommend this individually boxed set of MASH, especially if you can get it on the deal of the day!",1377648000,,1417,4.0

I have younger friends that don't ""get it"" and older friends that find it too irreverent of the military to want to watch it.  This was my haven when I came back from the military and too close to home in some episodes to ignore. It was always billed as a comedy, but a lot of the episodes dealt with the personal issues that being away from home and/or in the military can happen and needed to be addressed.  It had to deal with tough situations with humor and honesty in a way that I sometimes find very moving.  It was wonderful to find the complete series and the movie in one package so I can enjoy it anytime (and not wait to see the reruns when available.)",1377216000,,753,4.1020408163265305

1991722,3,B0001DA0B0,"This collection is a shrink wrapped reprinting of the 2008 individual season re-issues (same art and content: 3 DVDs per season) + the MASH DVD movie.  As expected this collection of individual titles does NOT include the 2 bonus DVDs found in the ""Martinis and Medicine"" canvas box set which was panned for cardboard disc holders that were notorious for scratches that impacted playback.

This 2013 collection is an improvement in protection but falls short of providing standard DVD case protection.  The cases are made of thin plastic with die cut front and back holders behind the art seemingly to save on plastic. This makes each case feel flimsy but more importantly the insert disc holders allow the DVD to touch the hard plastic surface compared to the 3rd DVD which is held slightly above the case like normal.  The result is that I see a light radial scratch on some of the discs held in the inner holders.  Fortunatley I have not seen any playback issues like I experience with the ""Martinis and Medicine"" box which had more notably scratched discs.  I only tested one of the DVDs, however.

The ""Martinis and Medicine"" box provides more content (the 2 bonus DVDs) but great risk of getting scratched discs which will freeze and skip during playback.  This package of individual seasons provides more protection but not as much as the original releases in double wide cases nor as sturdy as the 2008 pressing sold individually althought this set has the same art & content as the 2008 issue.

The show is obviously 5-stars but I give this package 3 stars (o-kay). I would prefer the original better protected double wide cases which also weren't flimsy.  Even the painted discs of the 2013 pressing seem cheaper (although same art) compared to the older versions.  By comparison I would give  ""Martinis and Medicine"" 1-star although it has the advantage of 2 bonus DVDs (which I enjoyed watching when I owned the box).  The issue w/""Martinis and Medicine""  is the cardboard holders which impacted playback (freezed and skipped).  So far I'm enjoying the 2013 package of titles w/o playback issues although my new discs aren't prestine.",1374710400,,2146,4.873278236914601
1991723,4,B0001DA0B0,"I snapped up this set as soon as I saw it.  I hadn't seen  it at this low a price before.  I grew up watching MASH and have seen many episodes multiple times in reruns.  This was such a great series.  I haven't watched any of the DVDs yet from this set but wanted to make sure people know that this set comes as 12 individual DVD cases.  There are 11 cases (one for each of the 11 seasons) with three DVDs  in each (as far as I know) and 1 case with the MASH movie.  They did not come packaged in a box at all.  All 12 DVD cases came individually wrapped and with the small security strip of tape on one edge of each case.  Then, all 12 cases are shrink wrapped together in one large shrink wrapped bundle.  The bundle is then put in a cardboard box for shipping.  This just seems like it was a bundle put together by Amazon.  It looks like they just took one of each season of MASH and then the MASH movie and shrink wrapped them all and put it on the web site as a package deal.  I took one star off for no box even though it didn't technically say there was a box included and for the cheap feel of the set.

Edit:  After having owned the set now and watched some of the seasons I wanted to add a couple of thoughts.

This is a bare bones set of DVDs.  All you get is strictly the episodes, that's it.  You don't get ANY extras at all other than the MASH movie which is also included along with the season DVDs.  There are eight episodes per disc and three discs per season for a total of 24 episodes per season from what I've seen so far).

I also wanted to alert people to a strange anomaly I found in the packaging of the individual season DVD cases.  On the season 7 DVD case, when I opened the case, I was looking at Disc 3 instead of disc 1.  My initial thought was simply that they had put the dvds in the case in the wrong order.  After looking closer, I found what they had done is that when the case itself was assembled the picture on the outside of the case which shows B.J. Hunnicut, Benjamin Franklin Pierce (Hawkeye)and Klinger was put on the case upside down and backwards.  If you open it with the picture oriented the correct way all the discs and the disc divider on the inside are backwards.  It's simply a quality control issue (sort of) in that the case was assembled wrong.  It in no way effects how the set plays, simply how that case looks on the inside.  Hardly worth mentioning but it does go towards the ""cheap"" feeling of this set given that it appears to have been assembled as an afterthought with just grabbing one of each of the 11 MASH seasons off the shelf, the the MASH movie and shrink wrapping the loose season cases together as one cheap 12 case box set, sans the box.",1374624000,,2710,4.0910815939278935

1991725,5,B0001DA0B0,"1st of all I ordered this the evening of 7/22/13 and it was on my doorstep 7/23/13 before 6pm!!! THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE OF THE HIGHEST ORDER!!!

This is one of the greatest TV shows of all time IMHO. All the actors did their job just about as good as possible. And the writing was even better than that. The directing was superb and so was the cinematography. The show was realtively realistic in showing what the Drs and RNs went through - losing lives - saving lives - 14 - 16 or more hour days under intense pressure. Being a pharmacist myself I understand a bit of the spot they were in. I'm NOT trying to say I understand completely as even through I have been involved in life or death situtations it certainly wasn't like what they experienced.

Those of you who have watched any of these will have their favorite characters - be it Hawkeye, BJ, Radar, Klinger, Col Potter, etc. This show was filled with memorable characters which allowed it to share the 'wealth' and keeps the show interesting. To me this is a key feature of this show - no one actor had to carry the entire load in each show. This kept the show fresh even if a character would die (as for Lt Col Blake) or just leave as Radar did.

I don't believe I've ever seen a MASH that wasn't at the very least very, very good. You can't say that about very many shows - that they were at least extremely good. And even thro they were made 30 years ago or so about a war that was more than 50 years ago almost of the stories as still pertinent to today problems.

But yet - they still managed to have fun - mostly to keep from cracking under all the pressure.

I would rate this show a near perfect scores of 9.75 to 10.0 out of 10

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR NEARLY EVERYONE!",1374624000,,1740,4.225903614457831

I have owned the Martinis and Medicine box set previously, but I decided to sell it when I needed some cash. It was a beautiful item on the shelf but I did find myself uncomfortable with the way that the discs were presented, it was hard to keep track of them and the cardboard cutouts they sat in felt a bit unstable. Having a large plastic case for each season seems like a nice touch, though you do lose the shelf appeal.

This set from amazon does appear to be a grouping of the seasons that have previously been sold. Having old previous individual season sets this might take up space, but you will definitely have protected discs. I have purchased other amazon groupings like this in the past and I have to say that I have been very pleased with the quality of each.

If nothing else the price of this item is astounding. Each season sells for up to 20 dollars each, and the Martinis and medicine package has only gone down this low once, it has pretty consistently cost 115.99 on here for the last 2-3 years.

Based on the product photo, this set has the individual seasons in standard DVD cases.  The ""Martinis and Medicine"" collection came in one box nicely decorated with canvas, but the discs themselves were in cardboard slots which caused scratching during shipment and normal use.  I received at least two discs that had severe enough scratches not to play properly.  Ultimately, I removed the ""Martinis and Medicine"" discs from the original package and placed them in individual cases.

Growing up M*A*S*H was one of my favorite series, and later in life it was one of the shows my father and I would watch together. Watching these again will be like visiting old friends.

Noticed someone asking about the quality of the DVDs - as I mentioned I have the first four seasons of this set (the same versions as shown), and the DVD quality is good. The aspect ratio is that of the regular full screen of the time 4:3. There are bonus features on each of the sets - and I think the product description details what each season set has as a bonus. These sets come in regular DVD clamshell cases, with the multiple discs on holders. The discs are all single sided. There are subtitles.

ETA: (7-30-2013)

Got in the complete set of DVDs. They are exactly the same as the seasons that I already had. I went through and checked all the discs and they all were in perfect condition.

1991742,5,B0001DA0B0,"""M*A*S*H,"" the classic CBS comedy-drama about a mobile army surgical hospital in the Korean War, struggled to find an audience in its first season but rebounded to become a regular Top 10 show in the 1970s and early 1980s.  The 1983 series finale, ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen,"" set a record for viewership with more than 100 million (myself included) watching, and remains today one of the most watched television broadcasts ever.

This DVD set contains the famous final episode in which Hawkeye (Alan Alda) has to overcome a nervous breakdown and that shows all of the characters saying their farewells and leaving Korea at the end of the war.  Also included is a bonus disc that has special features including a look at the show's history and a 2002 reunion of most of the actors.

The series has been off the air for 30 years--long enough that the series finale is equidistant between the war's end in 1953 and 2013.  The show is still so popular, though, that it is widely shown in syndication, and fans of the series would greatly enjoy having the finale on DVD.",1362009600,,1068,4.689839572192513

I've noticed a few sour grapes reviews because they went ahead and bought Season 11 before they ever knew they were gonna release ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen"", with awesome extras. Well, that stinks for them, because this 3 disc set is totally worth it. The extras are amazing!! It has the Shelley Long(Who guest-starred in an episode of M*A*S*H, before her own run on an all time classic), hosting a retrospective from 1991, I think it was, which was terrific. The 30th Anniversary Reunion Special from 2002 is also included, and is very informative. And it's cool to see the whole cast minus Linville and Stevenson because they were deceased, unfortunately, sitting around and talking over all the old, good times. They have on the set footage, and the last day of filming footage. Just excellent stuff. The one exta I was slightly disappointed with was the bloopers. They were only of Alan Alda and Mike Farrell, mainly, and only like 3 or 4 minutes long. Why no bloopers from the other actors?? It'd be awesome to see some of Alda and Rogers, or Steveson, or Linville, or Swit, or anybody else. But, that doean't deter this awesome release. If people bought the 11th Season already, it's totally worth it to double dip for the extras alone. Absolutely terrific. Two Thumbs way up!!",1361232000,,1332,4.745689655172414

I bought season 11 after buying all the others in order and I thought I had seen in the store that there were extras on it. I got home and noticed there weren't any. I reasoned that MASH was good enough without all of the extras on it's own.
I saw this in the store and thought it was the same as the one I already had but cheaper ($14.95 while season Eleven is usually around $19.95) and then realized that this was the finale plus assorted extras, not season 11.

 The best of the extras is a ""Biography"" of MASH from the Biography channel giving a pretty good timeline of MASH from book to movie to tv and the recruiting of and eventual departure of certain key members of the cast. Even the failed spin-off, ""AfterMASH"" is recalled here.

The 30 year Anniversary Special reunites the cast, minus Larry Linville and Mclean Stevenson who had passed on.
Also noteworthy is an earlier special hosted by Shelley Long (Diane Chambers on Cheers).

The rest of these extras are a little on the tedious side:

There are some bloopers mostly reaturing Alan Alda and Mike Farrell. These are bloopers that repeat the same scene and the same mistakes too many times and should've included the other cast members as well.

A segment of PSA's (Public Service Announcements) for charities featuring Mike Farrell which made me wonder if the dvd player was stuck on repeat. Each PSA is practically a carbon copy of the one before it and when shown back to back the effect is almost annoying.

Also each cast member names their favorite episodes. Usually this is where they first joined the others or where the writers began to give certain charcters more lines. Hot Lips engagement...BJ's first day...Potter's arrival...etc

The trivia quiz is really dumb with the easiest questions you could imagine. No challenge whatsoever.

The main complaint about putting all of these features on all in one set is overkill. The interviews here within are compiled from anywhere from the early days of the show until 30 years later and don't appear to be put together for the dvd. As a result many of these interviews say the same thing.

Be prepared for the cast of your favorite show to give numerous interviews in which the main point that is stressed was the way the show uniquely combined comedy and drama, which may be commendable but after it's repeated several times gets a bit monotonous. Also the development of each character is discussed somewhat at length and this too can become a bit much.

The people who bought the entire 11 seasons of M*A*S*H in the box set got it for less, that's true -- but, they had to contend with all those discs becoming dislodged during shipment.  Can you imagine having to check all those episodes for skips and other defects at once?  I bought the series one season at a time, and I like it a lot better - and the discs are better protected than they are in the box set.  I must confess, I was annoyed that we didn't get the discs with the outtakes, etc.  So, when this came along, I bought it - it's better than having to sell all 11 episodes and buy the box set, check it for defects, and blah, blah, blah!  My attitude at this point is simply this: I got what I wanted, so...WHATEVER!!

1991775,2,B0001DA0B0,"As to those complaining about the box set collection compared to having accumulated the entire series over time, what did you expect? That's the DVD business. And that's certainly MASH, who milked this series way past the ripe period to bilk it for all they could money-wise. By the time this final episode came out I watched it merely out of curiousity to see how they'd put this bastard child of its original idendity to sleep. It didn't displease as far as that goes, since it continued it's sappiness, extremely over the top acting and storylines, and frankly, going for the jugular for tears. But that's what MASH had been since season 4, evolving into that format with each season until culmiinating into ""Goodbye, Farewell, Amen."" I suppose by comparison to the final 7 seasons this wasn't so bad. It was at least consistent so there were no surprises. And to be fair, it wasn't as bad as I'd expected. But that ain't no ringing endorsement. In their overreaching attempts at pacifism, they did to Hawkeye in this final episode what they'd done to the series long before the airing of this program. Make no mistake, MASH had from the start made anti-war statements. But at one time it was done with some of the cleverest writing in TV history, and with some of the funniest dark humor, just like the movie it was based on. But like most writers of final episodes, this one seems to reveal that they just got too caught up in themselves in pandering to the audience's emotions rather than simply writing good material. Their decisions as to how to send of the various main characters (of which Klinger and Father Mulcahy were never really worthy of, particularly with their horrible acting) were reaching, but not really surprising, as was the writing for some time. And the other main characters fate's were interesting at best. This episode wasn't necessarily bad by the standards it had set up to this point. It's just that it was anti-climactic. So why the complaints? What did you really expect? Well, if you expected more, you got it with ""After MASH,"" the final smear on the once solid brand name of MASH.",1187740800,,2118,4.696236559139785

I am thankful I didn't have the buy the whole Martinis and Medicine to get the extras. Now, I gave this 4 stars because..Mash is and was the best TV series ever.  Through its comedy and moral lessons we laughed and learned.  I can't get enough of M*A*S*H and was hoping there were more bloopers (I found more on the internet and some from old VHS compilations). Also, I wish FOX could have included the elusive ""Making of M*A*S*H"" hosted by Mary Tyler Moore then by Judd Hirsh. THIS would have completed MY collection. If anyone has or knows where to get ""Making of M*A*S*H)which came out in the 80's, please post.

1991782,5,B0001DA0B0,"Yes, 20th Century Fox really kicked all us original M*A*S*H fans in the head for how they dragged out the releases of each season just slowly as hell over the years, just to put out an attractive complete series box set with hours of extras for less than half of what we, the most loyal fans, had to pay.  I'm glad that I don't have to buy that box set now just to get the bonus extras.  So, I guess I'll just have to cough up another 20 bucks just to get the bonus features.  Another 20 plus bucks! Jeee-zuss!!!

So now, we have to buy the final episode of ""Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen"" again just to buy the bonus features.  And so now we've paid for two copies of that same final episode.  Pay, pay, and pay some more!  Go ahead 20th Century Fox, suck us dry!  Here, just take my whole wallet!

They could have just released the bonus features without the final episode and made it a lower cost for all us ""already disgruntled"" M*A*S*H fans.  They could have just called it: ""M*A*S*H: The Bonus Box For All the Whiners and the Cry Babies"".  Yes, I'd be targeted for purchasing it.

But alas, 20th Century Fox has now entered a new arena of how to disappoint classic TV fans.  Now they are releasing the first season of ""WKRP in Cincinati"" and they are already getting tons of negative backlash for releasing the show WITHOUT the original songs from the series.  Way to go 20th Century Fox, I guess you just can't win.

But, I have learned from 20th Century Fox, to be more cautious about buying my favorite TV shows on to DVD.  I won't buy any DVD collection until I know all the seasons have been released.  So, I'll just wait for that one big box set that's likely to be released in the end.",1179964800,,1696,4.266457680250784
1991783,4,B0001DA0B0,"When I heard the ""Martinis and Medicine"" collection would house the bonus features fans had been waiting for, I was more than a little upset that the loyal collectors were essentially being forced into a mega double-dip. I quickly decided I didn't need the bonus features and moved on with my life. Then I heard about Fox's special release of the series finale, and was glad the studio was throwing us a bone.

Then I actually walked into the store on release day, and balked at that expensive bone.

Objectively, this is a fine set for both the casual and hardcore fan. Tying the bonus materials to a series finale release draws in additional sales that wouldn't be possible if this was the bonus materials alone. It's a gift set, if you will. Nice slim packaging, nice graphics. The best-produced MASH set outside of the Martinis and Medicine box. You kinda wish the other seasons were this slim.

Fox also did a great job digging through the archives for material. All the major documentaries are here, including Memories of Mash, the 30th reunion, the A&E special. The docs rely too heavily on series clips at times, but otherwise the info is there. There are classic PSAs and episode promos, and the legendary unproduced script where two nurses trick Hawkeye into thinking he's gotten them both pregnant (it was deemed too risque to film, and it's a hoot to read). There's also a blooper reel, but it's a fraction of the known bloopers out there. What happened to the other stuff? About the only other thing I would've liked to see would be the IBM commercials starring the MASH cast, but Fox probably doesn't own those.

So it's a great, comprehensive, inclusive set of extras - but again, it's a heavy sticker price! I'm sure Fox had the option to make this set even a few dollars cheaper, and they didn't take it. That's disappointing.

I bought it. I still question if it was fully worth the price, but I have it now and that's that. And Fox has no more MASH to tempt me with now.",1179705600,,1989,4.575842696629214

1991786,5,B0001DA0B0,"I understand the frustration to all who bought the season by season sets (myself included) but to those who didn't, but wanted the finale, this is a five-star set. This is STILL the highest-rated single episode in TV history - 125 million viewers - and that number is a far cry from the actual consumers who will buy the complete set; so for those, here ya are! The finale with all the extras!

The 30th Reunion Special features all the main stars (except the deceased McLean Stevenson and Larry Linville, even though there ARE interview clips of those two presented here) along with Gene Reynolds, Larry Gelbart, Burt Metcalfe and Allan Arbus (Dr. Sidney Freedman); Mike Farrell hosts this special, which aired in 2002. It's good to see Wayne Rogers and Alan Alda together again, although grayer. Loretta Swit still looks hot, but is that Botox or a face-lift? Jamie Farr never seems to age and Harry Morgan looks pretty feeble, yet feisty. Gary Burghoff is chunkier but still carries that sweet ""Radar-ish"" aura. William Christopher looks great as well, and there are times when he shoots the others a frustrated ""why-did-you-tell-them-that?"" glance when some Father Mulcahy behind-the-scenes anecdotes are told. If you've never heard David Ogden Stiers' real voice, you'll be surprised how much he does NOT sound like Major Winchester! The cast also tells us how much they loved working with Larry Linville (Major Burns) as his real personality was the complete opposite of ol' Ferret-Face. This Reunion Special is the best ""extra"" in the set.

""Memories Of MASH"" is an old TV special, hosted by Shelley Long, probably due to her success on ""Cheers.""

The bloopers are good, but not enough of them.

""Jocularity"" is a cast retrospective based on the word uttered by Father Mulcahy from time to time.

""Just The FAQs"" is a ten-question MASH-trivia game for the viewer. The other special features are pretty self-explanatory.

I didn't mind buying this set, even though I have all the separate season collections - it's reasonably priced and not boxed in a clunky package as the season sets are.

I see too many TV-DVD reviewers on Amazon complaining about SO MANY television releases (mostly due to music or other alterations) and I see no reason for anyone to TRULY complain about this set, aside from those who already own GOODBYE, FAREWELL AND AMEN on season 11.

I did collect the third season of M*A*S*H (my favorite overall), but I was hoping to add ""Goodbye, Farewell & Amen"".  This is the motion picture lengtht series finale to the greatest comedy-drama ever filmed.  Unlike many series enders this one nicely wraps up the futures of the characters and, after waiting for the war to end and to go home, it finally happens.

Also, if Father Mulcahy was really on the bus when the baby was murdered why didn't he too go to pieces? And ditto for BJ who has a young kid of his own? And Margaret took the baby's murder well too.

Though MASH occasionally grew tiresome in the latter episodes, the finale is fresh. As a movie, it probes new territory with more realism than before. The cinematography is excellent.

""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"" avoids being mushy or self-congratulating. It doesn't try to be very clever. Rather, it ends very naturally, both for the show and its audience of 11 years and the characters.

1991797,3,B0001DA0B0,"Well this was the final episode of one of the best television shows ever done. However, it's not anything like your typical M.A.S.H episodes. I feel that Alan Alda did the same thing that The Monkees did in the movie ""Head"". He literally destroyed the humor in this episode, and gave it new meaning. The same way that The Monkees would try and do in ""Head""; the Monkees made ""Head"" to not be like another Monkees episode from television. Alan Alda would make ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"" where there was no humor no Hawkeye getting a good one over on Charles, or Margaret. In fact the story opens up with Hawkeye in a psychiatric ward. I feel that this is where the timeline gets uneven. I think the episode ""As Time Goes By"" aired before this episode. Alot of time seems to have elapsed between the two episodes, and I think that's where it was done deliberately. It was done to illustrate how time stands still in a war. Anyway back to Hawkeye; his character is facing a crisis of faith, and esteem. He spends the first half of the episode trying to deny there was anything wrong with him, and Dr. Freedman is trying to make him relive what went on. Everything was fine until on the way home on the bus, and this is where everything starts to slowly, but surely become less cloudy. Hawkeye is tending to a wounded soldier on the bus, but he wants to think it's a big party from a big day on the beach. Hawkeye's passion for medicine knows no bounds, and Dr. Freedman is trying to get him to see that. Especially when the bus stops, and there's a baby crying on the bus, but Hawkeye wishes it was a chicken that he was thinking it was. Unfortunately his conscious fails him as he begins to slowly remember a baby was crying, and he tells the mother to keep it quiet, and then he remembers the worst part of the memory as he feels that the woman smothered the chicken, but she smothered her baby because Hawkeye told her to keep the baby quiet. Hawkeye calls Freedman an S.O.B. for making him remember that, but Dr. Freedman had to as Hawkeye would go back to doing medicine in the states after the war was over, and that included tending to children. If Hawkeye didn't face this he wouldn't cope as surgeon in civilian life. There was no laugh track, or live audience to play to in here as the atmosphere was made to be hot and intense. Even the punchlines were flat. This was the main intention of everyone involved that war is not all funny. However, it seems as though the plot revolves around Hawkeye, and the question of whether he'll grow up, or not. There was some tying up of loose ends with this episode where Hawkeye breaks through artillery fire to drive a tank into a trash pot. Considering Margaret constantly berated Hawkeye for not having courage, and then there's Charles who's said that the Chinese were uncultured and barbaric, and he meets a bunch of musicians who have some potential, so he conducts them, and maybe the possibility of friendship, but war wiped out the group, and it's jeep. Father Mulcahy also faces a crisis of faith when attempting to relocate a group of P.O.W.'s artillery fire, and a bomb explodes not too far from him causing him to have tinitis. Then there's Hawkeye's question of whether he will grow up, and get married, and have a committed relationship. He's done the one night stand now for 11 and a half seasons, and the question is will he try, and stay committed? One of the final scenes has Hawkeye and Margaret sharing a 3 minute kiss, and it's left to the veiwer's mind to see if he does get serious with a woman. The biggest one would have to be at the end where Hawkeye flies overhead, and sees a bunch of trashbags spelled out with the word ""Goodbye"" as it was done by B.J. considering Trapper left without a goodbye to Hawkeye. Pretty much it took 3 hours to wrap it all up, and bring the story to an end. It was done in a vote, and 4 out of the 7 main characters decided it would end at this point. Potter, Mulcahy, and Klinger would revive thier characters in ""AfterM.A.S.H"". That show did somewhat good the first year, but then the second season after Klinger's baby is born the show would run out of gas, and was cancelled. The problem with the show was the timeframe. It started out in the year being 1952, and then in the later ones it would backtracked to 1951. This is still a good episode, but for diehard fans only. If you want the episodes to remain funny then this will not please you. It's for diehard fans only.",1112659200,,4484,4.403614457831325

The canned laughter never belonged in the series. It was entirely inappropriate. If there is way to turn it off, I'd say do that before you watch a single episode.

Thankfully, there is no canned laughter in the final episode, ""Goodbye, Farewell & Amen"" and the episode shows much of the true nature of war, especially the part where Hawkeye has to witness a mother smothering her own baby to protect her comrades from being captured by enemy forces.

Undoubtedly, this is the most classic episode of all episodes.",1525219200,,836,4.680272108843537

8010396,5,B0001DA0B0,I was initially worried that the discs would come scratched or otherwise the quality would be lacking but that is far from the case with this collection! Additionally seasons 4-7 have the play all feature! Seasons 1-3 do not and I have not watched beyond season 7 yet but I will! The quality for 90% of episodes is awesome and if you want there is an option to watch the episode without the laugh track (which is really odd for me but eh). Its far more enjoyable to watch than the syndicated version!,1523404800,,500,4.387096774193548
