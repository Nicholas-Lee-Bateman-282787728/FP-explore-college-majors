2591037,5,B000FUTV4Q,"I am a slightly obsessive teacher with the quality of my lessons and because of it I bought these movies because they allow him(her) to offer to the student a moment of amusement or recreation on having broken the daily routine of the classes and simultaneously it offers a good material to analyze topics of class as the maternity and responsible paternity in case of the movies ""Juno"" and "" Love of rent "" or in applications of the science and technology in case of the movies "" I robot "" and "" Minority report "". These movies come in mint condition bearing in mind that I am from Costa Rica and the quality is excellent .. I am very satisfied with the material",1264032000,4,663,4.354838709677419
2591038,5,B000FUTV4Q,"This is a beautiful story about love and survival. It is well acted and the story unfolds with its own steady logic, and a few surprises. This is a love story but not a comedy. It is not a tragedy either.  For the price you could not possibly do better.",1263340800,6,253,4.06
2591039,5,B000FUTV4Q,"This was an intelligent film that was also sad, funny and emotional. Angie Cepeda gives a very moving and sincere performance as Sofia, a Colombian immigrant who is going to college and trying to get her life together. By chance she meets a young doctor who is attracted to her. Soon, she realizes that she likes him too. At the same time she finds herself falling in love with her neighbor's young foster child, played by the irresistably adorable Max Burkholder. But much to her dismay both of these relationships start to fall apart because of factors beyond her control. She finds herself struggling just to get through each day. But somehow she finds the courage to keep going. She begins to wonder if things will ever work out for her. I don't want to give away too much here, but this movie had an ending that flooded my eyes with tears. In short, if you like meaningful romantic comedies with genuine emotion, then please, find this movie and watch it. And don't forget to have a box of tissues handy.",1261440000,5,1009,4.580110497237569
2591040,4,B000FUTV4Q,"Me parece buena,  bastante romantica y sobre todo muestra un poco lo que sucede en la vida de un inmigrante que trata de salir adelante y como en los cuentos de hadas con un bonito final. Si me gusto.",1239062400,4,200,4.128205128205129
2591041,4,B000FUTV4Q,"*Love for Rent* (aka Amor en Alquiler) was a pleasant watch as it was different from others.  Just when you thought that things couldn't go more wrong, it spirals abyssmally for Sofia.

Sofia is a Columbian who is residing in America and studying law.  In order to do this, she had to illegally marry a man to get her green card.  Her cousin, Monica, has done the same thing except that she wants to be a singer.

Being a unreasonable jerk, Sofia's husband has stolen all of her possession, including her school books, closed their accounts and has done everything else possible.  Sofia cannot report him to the police because she risks deportation.  To top it off, her neighbor's foster son finds her hidden apartment key and steals her donuts.  It seems trivial but it was enough to send Sofia crying and screaming herself to sleep.

Monica and her husband take Sofia on a night out to get her mind off of her streak of bad luck.  Afterwards, on their way home, they meet a well-off couple who has flagged them for their car troubles.  However, miscommunication ensues and both are without a car.  In the midst of this, the couple asks Sofia to be their surrogate for $50,000.

Nearing divorce with an inevitable loss of a green card and broke, Sofia agrees to be a surrogate.  However, while surrogating, she meets a young handsome doctor, Neil.  In addition, she bonds with the neighbor's foster kid, Max.

For a while, things go smoothly.  However, things go wrong with Neil and with Max.  To top it off, she goes into labor.  Will love be able to withstand miscommunication or save someone?

I liked *Love for Rent* because it portrayed how Latinos worked themselves to the bone trying to stay in the land of opportunity and freedom.  Sofia did everything else possible to stay in school before deciding to be a surrogate.

The bond between her and Max was just pleasantly wonderful.  So, it was heart-wrenching when she discovers that Max was taken away from the child protection service.  She knows that it is possible she might never find him again.

*Love for Rent* is a wonderful film of a Latina's struggle to achieve her dream as well as her dealings with loved ones.",1187049600,13,2180,4.643979057591623

2591043,1,B000FUTV4Q,"This movie was linked to from the website of some little known singer Martita Roca. Problem is she is a member of the cult Growing in Grace,whose leader recently pro-claimed he was the anti-christ. This Roca person made the news today for getting 666 tatoed on her as tribute to her leader,just saying are these the type of people you want to support.",1172361600,,351,4.587301587301587

8127052,2,B000FUTV4Q,"This is one of the most cloying Cinderella stories I've seen in a long time. There are the stereotypical latina characters: beautiful, smart, sassy, passionate, volatile, and just a little loco, and then there is the Great White Hope in the form of a doctor. A lot of bad things keep happening in this movie, but don't worry, everything gets fixed up better than new!

Sofia and Monica are two cousins from Colombia, both in fake marriages in order to get green cards. One is married to an impossibly stupid American (but a ""lovable"" idiot), and the other to an evil jerk. But that's not the focus of the story. To make extra cash, Sofia agrees to be a surrogate mother, and in the meantime she falls in love with an American doctor. And she wants to save a neighbor's kid from an abusive life. Oh the complications!

At first, Sofia doesn't feel very attracted to the doctor, but once she's pregnant (as a surrogate), she gets uncontrollable urges to have sex (because that's what happens to hot-blooded latinas when they're pregnant), and that gives the doctor his opportunity to score. And score he does, because Sofia is so hot she has sex with the doctor for the first time - a man she doesn't really know at all - in the elevator of the building he lives in. The elevator is stopped for an hour or two. Yes, well, like I said, you know about those hot-blooded latina women. Sofia's so hot-blooded she even dreams of having multiple orgasms with an older man. Maybe I shouldn't have told you that because now you'll want to watch the movie just to see that scene. But believe me, it's silly and not worth it.

This movie can appeal to people who like Cinderella stories or white guys who want to watch a latina fantasy. It just occurred to me that the only two minority characters in this movie were the two cousins from Colombia.",1359244800,,1835,4.504504504504505
8127053,5,B000FUTV4Q,"This is a great movie!  I saw it on tv and kept trying to find it again but never could so I decided to try and buy it, it is that good.  It is funny, heart warming and so alive with culture. Love it!",1336694400,,200,3.522727272727273
8127054,5,B000FUTV4Q,"I cannot say enough about how great this movie is.  I had never heard of Angie Cepeda before.  Not only is she breathtakingly beautiful, but she is also a wonderful actress.  A pleasure to watch.  This movie had some really unique twists to your standard, predicable romantic comedy that kept your attention.  There was true chemistry between the leads, and the movie ended with the viewer walking away feeling all is right with the world!! If you are in need of a ""feel good"" movie, give this one a shot!",1314144000,,505,4.566666666666666
