3663997,5,B001KBEXSS,"I love this DVD.  I love the fact that she is chatty, but I know for some people it gets on their nerves but it encourages me.  The time goes really fast and the music is great.",1238889600,4,177,3.7567567567567566
3663998,1,B001KBEXSS,"I bought this DVD thinking on days I don't feel like doing extensive workout, I could do this. But it bored me to death while I was doing it. I think I am going to return this DVD. ITs not worth the money I spent on it",1236902400,,218,3.6595744680851063
3663999,5,B001KBEXSS,"Being a natural klutz and awful at picking up a beat, I was surprised at how easy it was for me to follow Leslie's cueing in this DVD!

2-Mile Walk:
*Each Mile is fifteen minutes long
*The walks consist of power walking, kicks, triceps kickbacks, and knee lifts
*I was surprised at how ""worked out"" I felt at the end of the 30 minutes
*Leslie incorporates some arm motion, especially in the second mile, but this focuses primarily on hips & thighs

Toning:
*Includes the ankle cuff which is comfortable and easy to wear
*Leslie Explains in the Introduction how to tighten or loosen the cuffs
*Toning focuses on lower body only, but is very thorough

Pros:
*I purchased this with Rainy Days in mind but have found myself using it even when it's sunny... I plan to purchase some more of Leslie's DVDs
*The cueing is the best I have ever seen on a DVD... For example she will say, ""Okay 8 steps left, 8, 7, 6, 5, Walk, walk, walk, 3, 2, 1""... She speaks on beat which is very helpful for the uncoordinated like myself. :)
*She's very friendly
*The workout was surprisingly intense for a ""beginners"" DVD, although I believe doable for a beginner
*The music is average workout-DVD-music, not great but not bad

Cons:
*The format of the DVD menu is cheesy
*After you've completed the workout several times Leslie's conversation becomes chatty... I wish there was an option to turn everything except the cueing off

Overall I was really impressed with this DVD and I am thinking about ordering her 5 mile.",1235779200,36,1498,4.574626865671642
3664000,5,B001KBEXSS,"I love this workout DVD.  It has the usual Leslie enthusiasm, lots of good moves, and I can already feel the difference in my body from doing the moves.  I feel and look slimmer!  I really like the leg cuff with the toning session.  The cuff is easy to slip into and helps so much to firm and tone the hips and tighs.",1234915200,22,317,3.984126984126984
3664001,4,B001KBEXSS,"I enjoyed this DVD as I do all of Leslie Sansone's workouts.  It is easy to follow and effective, especially for the lower half.  I like the additional resistance the fit-cuff provides.  My only gripe is that the tubing broke during the very first workout with it!!  Luckily, I was able to make my own afterward with another tube that I already had.",1335398400,2,349,4.492063492063492
3664002,3,B001KBEXSS,I like the work out video but the exercise band broke after 10 uses. The walking part of the video is more energetic and I like that part.  Dissappointed in quality of the fit cuffs.,1335225600,2,182,4.2
3664003,5,B001KBEXSS,"I've had this kit for about 1 year and still enjoy it. It is very fast paced and I only do it once a week, (but I also do several of Leslie's other dvd's). This dvd really focuses on getting your legs moving and it has helped tone my muscles. The fit cuff is awesome but you will be sore after the first time. My fit cuff snapped after a few months of use, so I tied it in a knot and kept on using it. Then it snapped in another spot, so I finally threw it out and replaced it with a similar resistance tube. Now my fit cuff works just fine. I sometimes just use the fit cuff by itself because its a really good workout for the legs. I would definitely recommend this dvd as one of Leslie's good ones, she really gets your heart pumping.",1328054400,4,737,3.953020134228188
3664004,5,B001KBEXSS,"I am 48 and in good (not great) shape.  This DVD is a great combination of cardio (2 miles) and toning for the lower body.  Do either one separately or both for an awesome, sweat-producing, and effective workout.  Just like with a personal trainer (which I used for 5 years before I moved to the sticks!).  Highly recommend!",1306540800,9,324,4.5344827586206895
3664005,5,B001KBEXSS,I walked away 35 pounds with Leslie and was in the best shape of my life...but I stopped and need to do it again,1264809600,5,112,3.7083333333333335
3664006,5,B001KBEXSS,"My husband & I have so many of Leslie's walk at home DVD's. Leslie makes it fun to workout with her. Although we love Leslie, sometimes you need to mute the little Darling so you can focus. Nonetheless, she's a wealth of information. In the beginning try not to mute often because you might miss out on the tips, coaching, info and her postive spiritual attitude about life. I've worked out w/ others and felt like I was in the military, worked out with them for a month and quit. Working out with Leslie, Mary Kay, Carol, Linda and the rest of her group is really like working out with fun friends. I reduced inches all over my body, eating healthy, and feel great. I've been with Leslie and her group for over 1 year, use her DVD's 5x's-6x's a week. We wouldn't trade her for the world!",1264464000,10,788,4.331081081081081
3664007,5,B001KBEXSS,"I like this relatively new one from Leslie Sansone. It's her alone, doing a 1/2 hour two-mile walk (not ""boosted""), and it's a nice, solid intense workout without being too jarring on the body. The production values are on the more professional side, and not super-intrusive, although I've noticed this one is auto-play on my DVD player, so keep an eye on it when you're putting your shoes on. The music is perky, but I recognize some of it from other tapes. There's a twenty minute firming for lower body section that she does with the cuff, but you could do the exercises without the cuff if you don't have one. The exercises are completely separate from the walk, so you don't have to do both if you're not in the mood. I like this one.",1262131200,7,739,4.4411764705882355
3664008,5,B001KBEXSS,"I have many videos by Leslie Sansone and she has made another nice workout video.  She is her normal, sometimes way too perky self, but it is a good video.  Nice pace and as always easy to follow the directions for what movements are next.  I like the walk band.  It does add a something extra to the workout.  Even if you don't use it all the time, the video is enough to get a good workout for it only being 3 miles.  I am glad I bought it even though I didn't buy it at Amazon.com.",1243296000,4,484,3.9381443298969074
3664009,5,B001KBEXSS,"I like this DVD.  It's more fast paced than say her 5 Mile (even with that boost).  This feels boosted through the 1st mile and into the 2nd mile and then she does do a cool down.  I just keep my pace up to the beat and move faster and still open up on the side steps wider and kick higher and life my knees higher.  You can basically do WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.  I can get my pulse up to 142 in this DVD and have trouble getting it to that on say her 5 Day Slimdown.  I can only get it up to 140 on the 5 Mile.  And with the leg band, I can keep it just between 128-130.  So not bad for doing strength training and keeping the heart rate up.  The time flies by.  I like to throw this DVD in twice a week along with the others and my treadmill/elliptical/resistance tube workouts.",1242518400,14,776,3.8238993710691824
3664010,3,B001KBEXSS,"I love Leslie (she can be a little silly, but I think she's kind of fun). Anyway this is not one my favorites, it is a pretty good work out towards the middle, but the beginning & end are a bit to slow for my taste, I use 3-5 lb weights during this one. I do like the lower body toning session @ the end. Not bad by any means just not her best. I think it would probably be great for beginners.",1241654400,8,394,3.7590361445783134
8314548,5,B001KBEXSS,This is my go to video. When i feel im to tired for the gym or if im under the weather but need a work out I always go to this video. I started at 250lbs and withthis video I was able to get down to 220lbs then I was able to run and got to the gym because i felt so much lighter! Now down to 170lbs and this is my second time ordering the same video.  My first copy i bought in 2007 or 2008 and it got scrtached so I decided to get it again! U can start off with one mile if u want! The bands and the tone up helps soooo much so don't skip it! You will see results in a couple if weeks! Love it!,1485043200,,595,3.507575757575758
8314549,1,B001KBEXSS,"Like the video, but the cord that came with the cuffs BROKE the third time I used them.",1432252800,,87,3.888888888888889
8314550,5,B001KBEXSS,great DVD,1426636800,,9,4.0
8314551,3,B001KBEXSS,"I really like the firming portion of the video.  It gives a good lower body workout.  The frustrating thing is that the tubing that runs through the cuffs keep breaking, and of course it was after I could return it. This is my second set.  The first one lasted at least a year, but the second set I bought only made it a couple of months.  It would also be helpful to just be able to replace cuffs or tubing without buying the whole kit. I have been looking for a similar type of tubing to replace it, but haven't found any yet.  I'm thinking this is an old product that has been sitting in storage, and the tubing is old and can't take much stretching any longer!",1409788800,2,664,4.15625

8314553,5,B001KBEXSS,Love this workout.  Leslie Sansone makes it so easy to exercise and the fit cuffs help the workout very much,1391299200,,108,4.4
8314554,4,B001KBEXSS,"Although I haven't used the enclosed band for leg-work yet, I am enjoying the new routines for my daily ""walks"". This one gives a little more control to putting together your own workout. Picking and choosing from a variety of walk options.",1366848000,,240,4.738095238095238
8314555,3,B001KBEXSS,"I have several Leslie Sansone programs and have loved them all. This one was OK but not the best. Of all her exercise products, the stretch bands for the abs are the best.",1360540800,,171,4.212121212121212
8314556,5,B001KBEXSS,"I really like this one a lot. The toning section is great!! I felt sore the next day first time using it so I knew it was effective.  Now I use it 3 times a week and my pants are becoming baggier. Yey, thanks Leslie for the help!",1349049600,2,229,3.7708333333333335
8314557,4,B001KBEXSS,"I like this workout - would like to have seen more miles, but use other boosters to get my heart rate up.  One downside was the fit cuff broke after Leslie suggested knotting it and I had only used it once, but her company was kind enough to send a free replacement",1338336000,2,265,4.096153846153846
