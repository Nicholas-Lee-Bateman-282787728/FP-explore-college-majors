1441552,3,B00005JKTE,"Starring Cate Blanchett as a young Scottish woman who joins the French resistance during WW2, this should have been a good film.  But someone made the ridiculous decision to have her speak English the entire time, even though there is a big deal made about how her character speaks fluent French.  Immediately  I was turned off as I've learned to expect at least this basic  degree of authenticity in films.
I must say though that the cinematography was wonderful; it brought me right into war-torn France.  I even learned a little bit about what it must have been like to live under the German occupation.  But the lead character's love of a British pilot that brings her to France in the first place, and her relationship with a French resistance fighter, played by Billy Crudup, just didn't sparkle.  And I've seen similar films about Nazi cruelty and Jewish deportation before.
Ms. Blanchett is pretty; and her wardrobe seemed authentic for the period.  But her lipstick was just a little too perfect and detracted from any emotion in her face. There was plenty of tension throughout but I was not emotionally moved.",1033776000,5,1120,4.827225130890052
1441553,4,B00005JKTE,"First, the negative points. With those out of the way, we proceed with the meat. The director should have eliminated the very appropriate criticisms of languages and accents in the dialog. Hey, with closed captions we can make clear what is said without sacrificing the accents that lend authenticity.
LET THE GERMANS SPEAK GERMAN (WHICH THEY DID) AND THE FRENCH SPEAK FRENCH (WHICH THEY DID NOT) AND THE ENGLISH SPEAK ENGLISH (WHICH THEY MORE OR LESS DID SPEAK). AND WITH THESE FAIRLY SIMPLE PROBLEMS, SOLVE THEM. USE LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATIONS AND INSINUATIONS AS THEY SHOULD BE USED. DO NOT ASK THE VIEWER TO SUSPEND ALL PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY.",1028851200,,647,5.0
1441554,4,B00005JKTE,"CHARLOTTE GRAY -- the movie -- is not high art, merely entertaining. This film is not THE ENGLISH PATIENT, although some scenes remind me of that ""other"" WWII film (why do Hollywood Nazis always look so glam?). The cast of CHARLOTTE GRAY is wonderful -- Cate Blanchett plays a Scots woman who travels undercover to France to work for the British and their Allies when her pilot boyfriend is shot down; Billy Crudup plays as a French resistance fighter who is a peacetime communist; Michael Gambon plays Crudup's father, a disapproving French farmer with a ""past"".
The script drags in a few places because there are too many plot elements and some of them are not fully developed. Supposedly, the film is based on a book which would explain the loose ends that could not be brought to closure in a standard length film. I have not been able to locate the book to clear up the confusion, but it seems the screenwriter who translated the book to the film version might have been forced to sacrifice detail critical to the integrity of the story.
The cinematograpy is beautiful. For example, the opening shots of a train carrying Charlotte Gray through the lavendar fields of southern France verge the sublime. I bought the DVD and saw the film on the small screen. I imagine scenes such as the train shots were stunning on the big screen.",1028764800,,1335,4.661016949152542
1441555,2,B00005JKTE,"Charlotte Grey stars the brilliant Cate Blanchet in a story reminiscent of the old British war movies about Odette Hallowes, 'Odette', or Violette Szabo 'Carve her name with pride'. All of these films have elements that intertwine with each other, such as strong women characters, wartime propaganda, romance, etc. But as a film of its type, ""Charlotte Grey"" fails quite badly.

Grey is a Scot who falls for an RAF pilot, but their relationship is cut short when he is shot down over occupied France. On the basis of this, she then decides to join the SOE (Special Operations Executive) as a spy for the British. Which is severely undernourished as a plausible reason to grab a weapon and a bit of silk and jump into enemy territory.

Her command of French comes in very handy (not that she'll need it for this film) and her strong will is helpful too, not to mention her unrealistic hyper-patriotic notions.

After a disappointing and all too hasty ""training"" section of the film, Grey is dropped into France where...yes you guessed it...she falls in love again, this time with a member of the French resistance...of course she does. It seems to me sometimes, that all women can do in WWII films is fall in love with everyone within a 20km distance and ""Charlotte Grey"" is no exception unfortunately.

From here the film falls rapidly down a seemingly never-ending hill and it's a hill sodden with tired old clichs. Nothing much of consequence really happens and it's a shame, as the film could easily have been expanded into a far more entertaining and realistic exercise. The usual stereotypes of bad WWII movies are all here...The beautiful woman pining for her man, the noble French resistance (who all speak in mock French accents that sound like they're extras from the old BBC sitcom ""Allo Allo""), the slimy Vichy French and of course the ""evil"" Germans who, by the way, seem only to want to catch Jews and ship them off to Auschwitz. Like nothing else ever happened in WWII.

All in all, this is a film that is severely truncated by the producers fear of actually making something different, other than the usual wartime trollop that's served up to a generally unknowing audience. Oh well, we'll have to mark it down as another missed opportunity. See the other two films mentioned above, they are far more entertaining and they do everything ""Charlotte Grey"" does... but much, much better.",1027987200,8,2399,4.799031476997579
1441556,5,B00005JKTE,"I LOVED this movie. From the second it started, with its gorgeous shots of French lilacs or lavender or whatever beautiful purple flower they are, & its sublime musical score by Stephen Warbeck, I was hooked. Cate Blanchett is always dependably good, but she really shines here. Her role is that rare thing- a woman who is not a doormat, a girlfriend, a hooker, or a nun, and she never gets naked. How refreshing! Plus, it's directed by a woman- too cool! I found the love story between the characters of Charlotte Gray & Peter Gregory very believable & terribly romantic, and, as it should, it drives the film to its logical conclusion- a heartbreaking one. Indeed several scenes in this film made my eyes well up with tears. I also appreciated how Charlotte's experiences with loss weren't just glossed over, as in most movies I've seen where someone loses a loved one and by the next scene they're back to normal. Ms. Blanchett is to be commended for bringing that bit of true humanity to her character. It's just an all around beautifully made film, and I admire everyone involved in the making of it. The director's commentary is also very good and worth listening to, however she gives A LOT away, including parts of the book that weren't included in the film. She does a good job of answering her critics during her commentary, particularly speaking about her reasons for having the characters speak English, which originally struck me as a bit odd, but her reasons are legitimate, and, after all ""Chocolat"" & ""Schindler's List,"" to name just two, are in English & nobody complained about that. One minor thing that I found annoying, though, was the quality of the disc's supplemental materials- they misspelled...both Cate Blanchett's & novelist Sebastian Faulks' names- shame on them!",1027123200,41,1793,4.843648208469055
1441557,5,B00005JKTE,"CHARLOTTE GRAY is a much maligned movie, perhaps due to the fact that we are actively in a war state at present, a war state that is grossly dissimilar from the tenor of WWII.  But whatever criticisms that may be laid at the doorstep of this fine little movie are quickly overcome by the visual beauty of the photography (have fields of lavendar in Southern France ever been so lushly captured/painted by a photographer?, etc) and most importantly by the performances by a cast of excellent actors.  Cate Blanchett is certainly one of the most versatile and accomplished actresses on the screen today.  Her commitment to this role of a Scottish woman who joins the French Resistance because of her love of a pilot and develops into a true believer in the plight of the invaded French people is a tour de force of natural acting.  Billy Crudup continues to grow in stature as an actor and Michael Gambon raises the level of distinguished performances. Yes, this film tugs at the heart a bit....is that bad now?  War creates abrupt changes in people and results in permanent alterations of places and psyches, and the various subplots of CHARLOTTE GRAY make a strong point of this fact. See this film and decide for yourself.",1026604800,17,1223,4.723004694835681
1441558,1,B00005JKTE,"Gillian Armstrong utilises her talents to the full in this truly dreadful film.  All her hallmarks, so wonderfully showcased in the appalling 'Oscar and Lucinda', are on display once again.  Characters with all the depth and complexity of shop window mannequins, are seen from all angles (thanks to cameras mounted in helicopters and on other forms of whirling apparatus) and in all manner of hackneyed situations, unveiling one earnest emotion after the next.  Mercifully, my friend and I managed to survive the film without falling victim to coincident cerebro-vascular accidents or some other fatal misfortune, because it would be regrettable to have this schmalzy garbage as one's last memory of this world.
*
The cinematography is striking, as is Ms. Cate Blanchett.  She wears a thrilling parade of French couture throughout the film, changing costume with a frequency that would make Barbara Streisand envious.  Her hair, despite wartime shortages, is also in immaculate condition and coiffure, and her make up is simply to die for.  She rides a bicycle with aplomb, and points a gun manfully.  Described early on as a most cunning linguist, she manages to speak English with a Scottish, an Australian, a fishy (or was that Vichy?) French, and quite possibly an Icelandic, accent: this feat in itself upstages the accomplishments of Meryl Streep, who needed a half dozen movies in order to employ her full complement of accents.  Billy Crudup only manages the regulation American, the botched English, and the wan French.  Still, he bests the rest of the cast, who don't bother attempting any accent at all.
*
The story's engine is love.  Kate meets a likely lad, a Royal Air Force chap in fact, one night at a soiree and ends up sharing a misty window pane with him the next morning, after a spot of wartime bedroom desperation.  He goes off to fight, and she, determined to be brave, follows.  Admirable indeed - a jolly capable young filly, what ho!  In occupied France she meets villains (boo! hissss!) and heroes (one can almost hear the Marseillaise playing in the background) and she is drawn to the latter and repels the former, God what!  You can guess the rest from here.  The music swells (as did I), the tears run (as did my friend - out of the theatre), and highly manipulative and distressingly bad cinema is the result.  Hopefully Ms. Armstrong will collaborate with Mr. Spielberg in the near future, for something unequivocally nauseating.
*
While the cost of the DVD is quite reasonable, I would willingly pay many times this amount in order to avoid seeing this film.",1024012800,13,2592,4.910550458715596
1441559,5,B00005JKTE,"""Charlotte Gray"" is a film which has left me stunned, amazed and grateful at the chance for being able to see such brilliance. The movie consists of a simply thrilling storyline, beautiful scenery and wonderous acting on the parts of every character. It is a film for those who are willing to believe anything is possible - that ""there must be something to set against all this"".
Charlotte Gray is a young Scottish woman who falls in love with a soldier who goes off to WW2. His plane crashes, and so, she becomes a spy to go to Occupied France to rescue him. Upon arriving in the Vichey France; she meets a team of revolutionaries and a new, and tangled storyline emerges from there. Many criticise both book and film for shirking on the WW2 accuracy, but I feel that it *concentrates* on ceratin aspects of the War, instead of skimming over about twenty different circumstances.
Cate Blanchett is unbelievably good as Charlotte - she performs excellently and you can see how her character changes and grows throughout the film. Her stirring speech at the near the end of the movie is simply amazing - she delivers it with feeling and emotion. Billy Crudup took my breath away. He was more than fantastic in his role! He breathed life into the character of Julien, and captured my imagination with his performance. Truly excellent! Notable mentions go to all the other actors, but Billy and Cate stole the show, in my opinion.
If you are looking for a fantstic movie that will take you to another time and place, make you think, and allow you to both remember the pain and tragedy that WW2 brought; and the hope for humanity that was displayed by the brave people who fought for good -  Charlotte Gray is the movie for you.

The costumes/settings are gorgeous even though it's war.  The back-stories (the children, and the father/son relationship of one of the main characters) are compelling.  The tension when there's danger is so well-done.  Cate and Billy Crudup are excellent.  They are always just one step ahead of the very dangerous game and sometimes don't even know if the can trust each other.

Charlotte becomes a secret agent in France with a mind to finding her missing pilot boyfriend who was shot down.  But then she meets Billy Crudup and his fabulous bone structure, and the rest is history.  Michael Gambon was wonderful in this. And though the story is somewhat predictable, the acting is superb. Blanchett, Crudup, and Gambon are three of the greatest actors on the planet, and Gillian Armstrong directed, so you really can't go wrong. I guess you'd call it the ultimate ""chick flick""--but to me, that's not an insult. It's a great rainy-day escape movie about love and duty and honor and lovely Billy's chiseled cheekbones.

1441744,2,B00005JKTE,"Charlotte Gray, 2001 film

This Scottish woman volunteers to work as a spy in WW II France. It shows her training, then her parachute drop into Occupied France, and her activities there. She is used to gather information and transmit it by radio to England. There are crises and narrow escapes. A collaborator wants to make a deal with Charlotte to save two young boys living in an old mansion. Then there is trouble with officials who round up Jews for transportation, including those two young boys.

A young man tells her his duty is to survive, and asks her to flee with him to Toulouse where they will be able to cross the Pyrenees into neutral Spain. [No mention of money or contacts or papers.] Were those house chosen because they were available and looked old? Some seem too big for an ordinary family. The fault in this story is its originality, its not based on actual events by a real person.

The Gendarmes arrive with drawn pistols looking for Dominique (her cover name). [Note the six-shooter revolver carried by one Gendarme!] People are loaded into railroad boxcars and taken away. Charlotte slips a typewritten note into one boxcar; it offers hope to the boys. Six months later Charlotte is back in London. She gets a letter and meets a man she met in France. Hello. She tells him hers name.

This movie means well, but seems off target. There were better movies made in the past. Watch Carve Her Name With Pride about the real activities of Violette Szabo.",1471305600,,1475,4.639846743295019

The way the boy moves his hand so wishfully over the typed words that he believes are from his mother whom he has not seen in months truly captures the essence of his love and longing for her.

1441999,3,B00005JKTE,"I have no opinion on the adequacy of this movie relative to Sebastian Faulks's novel, which I haven't read -- but I'm sorry to say that the movie didn't work for me.  The cast is fine, there are intense scenes, and the cinematography is often striking, but the emotional rhythm never built in a convincing way, at least for me, and there were holes in the plot that were distracting too.  We're in the middle of World War 2, and Charlotte Gray (Cate Blanchett) is a Scottish nurse who happens to be fluent in French, and so when the man she loves, a bomber pilot, is shot down over France, she trains as an agent who will enter Vichy-controlled France to work with the Resistance there -- all the while hoping, of course, that while she is there, she can find out what happened to her airman.  When she hits the ground in a small village in France, however, she finds that the collaborationist Vichy officials are proactively seeking out Jews to meet German quotas for the camps, and it isn't long before the Germans themselves sweep into town to make sure that things are done as they wish.  Two Jewish children -- ones who happen to have seen Charlotte parachute in -- are placed in obvious danger, and with the help of a local Resistance leader (Billy Crudup) and his father (Michael Gambon), Charlotte tries to keep them out of harm's way.  The Germans and the French collaborators are presented in broad stereotypes, and the anguish of Charlotte is communicated too often by close-ups of Cate Blanchett's face.

The actors are too experienced to be anything but adequate in their roles, but the movement of the action is too bitty, and the intensity doesn't build as it should.  One feels too that children at risk is a rather too obvious card to play, at least as straight as it's played here, and that, along with the stereotyping of the bad guys, makes the movie seem more obviously exploitive of our feelings than the director (Gillian Armstrong) perhaps intended.  As for the plot holes -- how exactly does Charlotte get back to England, given that the place is crawling with Germans?  And what are we to make of her return to France?  The movie has shown us no reason for her to -- spoiler coming up -- seem to prefer the Resistance fighter to her airman.  It's true that both have suffered losses that amount to kinds of betrayals (for the best of motives, of course), and yet the weightiness of such facts doesn't seem to really be what's on their minds, or the movie's mind, at the close.  Looking at the reviews, it seems that a lot of people liked the movie more than I did, but I can't get away from the feeling that my buttons are being rather too obviously pushed here.",1434067200,,2688,4.519587628865979

Charlotte Grey puts human faces on the terror which ordinary people of the French countryside endured.  I could say that Charlotte's mission is to ensure that the hope doesn't escape from Pandora's box.

Unlike some war films I didn't detect the 'f-bomb' bursting all over the landscape, ruining the experience.  And when a certain village mole attempts a rape, I suspect Charlotte is disappointed in herself for not shooting him according to her training.  Although she puts him off and declines his sexual advance, his treachery rips her heart out later (with my own.)  When she denies having done her best, I believe she's wishing she could have aborted that evil before it came to pass.

Such epic tragedy, emotionally charged, suspenseful action, I was riveted in place.  I didn't leave the room at all for anything.

This is not actually a review of the movie ""Charlotte Grey"" as such, but to provide some information people buying this film might like to know.

Contrary to all I have read in Amazon's film description of this film It was not based on the life of a Scottish woman married to an RAF pilot but an Australian.  This came from an international news report shown earlier today. The report was on the death of Nancy Wake a few days ago in an English nursing home. Nancy Wake came from Australia about the time Germany took over France. She worked in the French underground rescuing downed pilots and others the Germans were after. After some training in England she returned to France and became THE most highly decorated of all in the French underground for her exploits against the occupiers, especially after the arrest, torture and execution of her husband. She was one of the most sought after of all the underground operatives by German military, but was never arrested, probably because they were looking for a man, not expecting that a women was that capable.

The news report included a segment of an interview with her a few years ago (she appeared to be in her eighties at the time) in which her closing comment on her war service was that in her opinion ""the only good German was a dead was a dead one. The deader the better. And that is all I will say about that.""

The news report specifically mentioned the movie ""Charlotte Grey"" being based on events in Nancy Wake's life.",1313107200,6,1491,4.573033707865169
1442324,3,B00005JKTE,"Since I read his Birdsong (which I thought was amazing) first, I felt Charlotte Gray is a lesser strong book. I had serious questions about the credibility of Charlotte character. Even though she was sent to France for six months, but it didn't seem that long, on a mission, which itself seemed to have flaws. I couldn't tell exactly what she was supposed to accomplish there other than the fact that she spoke French. For a while, I thought she was going to save the Jewish boys from taken away by the Nazis but she didn't. And then I thought she must be on another mission of searching for her boyfriend, whose plane was shot down. She didn't do that either. Instead, she was having sexual relationship with another man while she was on her `mission' and still claimed that she loves her boyfriend. In the end, it was her boyfriend who had to track her down! Some of the historical facts were interesting, although seemed disturbing. I am a fan of Faulks and I like the way he writes. Charlotte Gray, in my opinion, may not win everyone's heart.",1312416000,2,1047,4.515789473684211
1442325,1,B00005JKTE,"I am a late comer in viewing this film, even later in reading a synopsis of the heroine's life in the Telegraph news publication, which told of a much more interesting woman.  The Telegraph article, Lonely death of real life Charlotte Gray, reported that Ms. Gray was flown to France to work as a wireless operator. ""Four months later she was caught using her radio set but, even after torture, persuaded the Gestapo that she was merely a little shopgirl who knew nothing of undercover war operations. But on Aug 15, 1944, she was sent to Ravensbrck concentration camp in Germany. She was later transferred to a forced labour camp in Silesia, on the German border.
On April 13, 1945, she escaped with two French girls from the forced labour gang by hiding in the forest. They later travelled through Markkleeberg where they were arrested by the SS. Eileen Nearne's ingenuity again proved to be life-saving, because they were released after convincing their captors of their innocence. The three women were hidden by a priest in Leipzig until the arrival of United States troops. I realized that the movie was a poor representation of this woman's life.""  This would have made for a more heroic story.

Gray spoke of being a hero and of making a difference but when the time arrived to do so, she failed miserably. I was gravely disappointed that Gray, the protagonist in this film, did not attempt to fulfill her commitment she made to the boys as they were being taken away by the Nazis.  ""I will find you,"" she scream.  Whenever a protagonist makes this claim, h/she always deliver but not this one.  Not only did she not seek them out, she never even spoke of the boys again.  Even when the resistance leader begged her to flee with him, she rejected and declared that she could and would do more.  So logical person would interpret this to mean that she would attempt to free the boys, NOT! She was more talk than action.  The ending would have been perfect had she, the resistance leader (her new love) and the 2 boys shared the last scene as a family.

If you're going to change the events of a true story, you should at a minimum make it more interesting and satisfying.  This film did not.  I can not forget those 2 boys as they gently touch the letter they thought was written by their mother.",1308096000,3,2302,4.574209245742092
1442366,4,B00005JKTE,"Charlotte Gray (Cate Blanchett) is a young Scottish woman who falls in love with a British pilot in WWII, and volunteers to work undercover in Vichy France when she learns he was shot down there.  She doesn't tell anyone her true motivation, however, putting others in the underground at deadly risk as she tries to get more information about him.

There are times she is called on to be strong and brave.  The training she received prior to leaving on her first mission makes this part believable.  However, the director chose to allow all the actors (except the Germans) to speak in their normal accents... Scottish, English, French, and American.  This was noticeably jarring at times, because you'd be thinking, ""Gee, the German soldiers or Vichy police should recognize THAT accent as a foreigner!""  Instead, they'd say good day and go on with their business.

The general plot and the ending was a bit predictable.  Brave woman makes mistakes, takes a deep breath of reflection, then charges ahead.

1442367,5,B00005JKTE,"The movie Charlotte Grey provided a good snapshot of women spies of the SOE dropped into France during WW II.  The life span for these women averaged less than 6 months if they were lucky.  The work was very dangerous, and it was impossible to know who could be trusted.  If you trusted the wrong person, you ended up tortured and executed by the Gestopo.  These women spies were something new for the British and their participation was resented by the upper chain of command.  However, they were very successful.  This movie also provides a good example of life during this time period.  WW II brought about many changes for women.  Dangerous work as a spy, was one of the most significant.  This movie is well worth your time and money.",1292716800,,739,4.580152671755725
1442368,4,B00005JKTE,"2001's ""Charlotte Gray"" stars Cate Blanchett as Charlotte, a young Scotswoman whose RAF boyfriend goes missing in action over France during the Second World War.  The stricken but suddenly steely Charlotte volunteers for duty with the British Specials Operations Executive, and is soon parachuted into France for dangerous work with the French Resistance.

Cate Blanchett is quite solid as Charlotte and as Dominique, her undercover Resistance personna.  Rupert Penry-Jones is Peter, her wartime romance who goes missing.  Billy Crudup is complex and emotional as Julien, Charlotte's Resistance point of contact.  The location shooting in Scotland, England, and especially France, is authentic and atmospheric.

""Charlotte Gray"" is entertaining but the plot is a rather confusing mix of unconventional romance and a gritty story of betrayal.  Charlotte's original mission of rescuing her boyfriend gets lost in a morally gray struggle between the Resistance, the Germans, and French collaborators, setting up a not entirely satisfying ending.

""Charlotte Gray"" is highly recommended to fans of Cate Blanchett.",1281052800,,1109,5.7607361963190185
1442369,3,B00005JKTE,"I was so entranced watching Cate, I barely noticed the very legitimate problems other reviewers expressed about the film CHARLOTTE GRAY. It's easy to see why her career keeps climbing, she must be every writer & director's dream actress. You cxan easily imagine her playing any of the great roles--from Medea to Hedda Gabler to...well, to all the movies she's recently been in. Her beauty is at once breathtaking and simultaneously simply elegant.

Her astonishing presence commanded every scene--and she was in every scence--which was a good thing, because as other reviewers indicated, there were some major problems with the script.

I'll just mention a few here so as not to be repetitive of what other reviewers have already noted.

For starters, the characterizations--particularly that of Charlotte--barely touch the surface of genuine personhood. She immediately falls in love with a hunk of a British officer, and when he crashes over France a few days later, Charolotte immediately signs up to be a conduit for the French Resistance (WWII)& before you can say ZAP! without any real training other than a scene that has the lovely Cate slevtly dressed in battle fatiques & showing she knows how to fire a gun--she's being parachuted into occupied France. What nonsense!

The script--but for our heroine--is equally thin once she arrives. The Resistance is apparrently run like an incompetent social club, nobody seems to know what they're doing--except for Cate's character--and they are easily eliminated by the Nazis just when the audience would expect to see more of them. At one point even Blanchett's charcter expresses frustration and actually admits, ""I don't know what I'm doing here!""

There is just enough grittiness to remind us that war is bad & the holocaust terrible; but even the Jewish boys Cate is helping to conceal from the Nazis seem to only be there so she can play a surrogate mother scene. If a film is going to invoke the holocaust, then it would really be advisable to have substance to it--that, or leave it out entirely. In fact, there are quite a few things that should have been put in or left out in CHAROLOTTE GRAY.

I could go on, but won't.

The movie & production values were good enough that I watched it twice. If truth be told, it was really just to watch Cate again. This was her showcase, her show--and for that, it was worth seeing.

Yes, I'm a fan...or a writing desk...whatever.

1442372,4,B00005JKTE,"""Don't give up hope, Peter, he's a real fighter..."" That's what Charlotte Gray (Blanchett) was told when she heard her boyfriend, Peter, was shot down in France.

When given a choice between faith, hope, and love which one was most important--she chose hope.  That's why Charlotte took training as part of the French Resistance.  If Peter can't get free from the Germans on her own, she's going to come back to free him.

""Always remember who you are not..."" This is the lesson she's given. She is now Dominique.  Charlotte Gray is dead.  She has a new name and she has no opinion of the war, she simply wants to survive...

""Charlotte Gray"" is an under-rated but strong tale of heroism and yes, hope.  While Blanchett is known for many more 'stately' roles, she will also be remembered for 'who she is not.'

1442374,5,B00005JKTE,"""Charlotte Gray"" is the story of the love that causes people to fight and survive during a war. But war can cause heartache as well as romance. Death is often just around the next corner. Only the strong survive, and dare to carry on.

Cate Blanchette (Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Indiana Jones, & The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) plays the fantastic role as Charlotte, Scottish, who becomes an SOE (Special Operation Executive) agent. She joins to search for her lover, Peter, who is a RAF pilot shot down in France.

Under an alias, Charlotte gets involved with the resistance, and entangled in the lives of some Jewish families. She hears that Peter is dead, but continues to help with the local French effort as well as hide a pair of Jewish boys. She comes under the influence of Julien, a resistance fighter, himself 1/8th Jewish. War, unfortunately continues to take its toll with the lives of people Charlotte contacts.

The questions is, will Charlotte survive the 1 out of 3 odds of returning home?

A great job of filming within a small French town, making the set and action very realistic. This film shows a part of WWII often ignored. It has beautiful sets, even for a war-ravaged country. ""Charlotte Gray"" is about touching relationships and has the unexpected ending. A DVD VALUE for historical drama and romance.

Her fluency in French, coupled with her keen intellect, made her an instant choice for this mission -- all quite believeable. The varied associations along the way made it so much more interesting. The scenery was so gorgeously filmed and inspiring, that I took a trip to SW France to see it for myself and was not disappointed! I truly admire Cate Blanchett, and her acting in this film was wonderful. The supporting roles were also quite well done.

Cate was great and it really is her film.  Billy Crudit (misspelled I am sure) really did a great job as the hero.  Michael Gambon is a great favorite of mine also.  This movie is done in the same way that Gambon did the Magret series for the BBC and PBS.

1442418,2,B00005JKTE,"Let me state the obvious.  Charlotte Rampling is phenomenal in anything that she does.

With that out of the way, I can go so far as to say that Cate Blanchett ranks well into the second place position with her strong body of work and amazing ability to evoke the strongest of emotions.  It doesn't matter if you are watching her in the phenomenal ""Elizabeth"" or the slightly obtuse film ""The Shipping News"" or even the hysterical Armstrong pic, ""Life Aquatic"", she is worth every moment of screen minute.  Blanchett ranks up there with my philosophy of Gene Hackman.  The man may not make the greatest of films, but he is always worth watching.  The same can be said for Cate.  She may not make the greatest film choices possible, but she does keep you eye focused on the screen.  This was my thought as I watched the disappointing biopic entitled, ""Charlotte Gray"".  I was actually looking forward to this film with such amazing actors taking the helm as Blanchett, the amazing Michael Gambon, and the quieted Billy Crudup, but even with such power players behind the words, one could not cover up the mush-mouthed film that director Gillian Armstrong attempted to create.

I don't mean to be harsh, but there were some serious flaws in this film that even director Armstrong addresses in the audio commentary.  The first which was obvious as the film began its downward stroll, was the issue of language.  This was an Australian film, beginning in Scotland, going to England, and ending up in France.  So, what language would be best to be used?  Anderson took the southern approach and decided to not  use the native tongue, and instead throw at us a very weak French accent for all occasions.  Gambon, obviously, chose not to do any of these options and went with his own accent.  Crudup seemed the least apt to handle this non-American accent, while Blanchett ... well ... she did what she could, constantly fluctuating between her Scottish accent and that of something that could only be called ""French"".  It was not a strong way to lure the historical cinema guy into the picture.  While I realize that it would have been tough to ""sell"" this as a foreign language film, I do believe that it would have pulled me deeper into the story and into the trenches of what these women had to do for their country.  Instead, it just felt cheap and extremely Hollywood-""ized"", though it wasn't.

The story followed suite.  It was supposed to be this grandiose story of a woman's plight for her country.  It was supposed to be this story of independence and self-discovery, but alas, it transformed into this mushy story about love with no cohesiveness.  We begin this adventure with a woman who is afraid to smoke around others, afraid to drink in public, and suddenly falls head over feet with a man whom she is willing to do anything for.  While Armstrong did address the quick courtship in this film, I just felt like we needed more explanation.  We needed to see her independence further before making the rash jump into bed, so to speak.  Then, quickly, we are placed into training, lies, and finally dropped over France.  All before we can really see who this woman really is.  I wanted, needed, desperately desired, to know who Charlotte Gray was before getting deep behind enemy lines.  I don't mind a two hour film, but two hours in France not quite understanding our main character is not a way for a film to just be thrown in our faces.  Who was Charlotte?  Who was Gambon?  Who was Crudup?  I needed this, but alas, Armstrong was too busy focusing on love, random acts of children, and a family torn between two generations.  Haven't we heard this all before?

So, we have this weak message, sent by mediocre voices, through a war that gets more and more random as the minutes progress.  Can anyone answer to me what the true mission was of Gray during her tour?  Why would she fight so much with so less reward near the end?  Did those we viewed through the film just disappear by the end?  Too many questions for what should have been just a straight forward film.  I wanted concise direction and a focus towards our main character, Gray, but instead we were handed a hodgepodge of stories that never quite connected.  Armstrong attempts to answer those nay-saying critics through the audio commentary with feeble responses and dramatic ""I was the director"" cards.  It becomes difficult for foreign directors to try to capture the feel and truthfulness of another country's hero.  Armstrong failed in this case.  She even second-guessed a couple of her scenes in the final film, a sure-fire sign that it wasn't the film that you wanted to finish with.  The only director that can successfully critic his  own films, and that is Uwe Boll, and that goes without saying.

I can't say that I was happy with the overall finale of this film.  The glue wasn't very tight and instead of honesty, Armstrong seemed to focus on the randomness of love, circumstance, and scenery.  I didn't think this was a solid film at all, and have to side with the critics that seemed to think that this was just another biographical fluff film.  Blanchett acted her heart out (for no apparent reason), and Scotland was beautiful, but I cannot credit anything else with this film.  If you are looking for history, I would find something else.  If you are looking for a title that you would find in the ""romance"" section of your local bookstore, then ""Charlotte Gray"" is the film for you.

1442421,4,B00005JKTE,"MESMERISING and beautiful Cate Blanchett plays the lead role of Charlotte Gray during World War 2. She is an ambulance driver from Scotland working in London but is recruited by British Intelligence into the Special Operations Executive. Why? She has lived in France and speaks French like a native. Her first interview is actually on a train as the recruiter from MI6 pretends to be a fellow passenger and engages her in conversation. The SOE was actually sent by Winston Churchill behind enemy lines to as he so aptly put it, ""...set Europe ablaze..."" From assassinating high ranking Nazis like Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia to blowing up German bases, you name it and the SOE did it. The SOE actually helped to set up the OSS which was the forerunner of CIA. Cate Blanchett's acting is superb in her role as she displays a whole range of emotions from love to terror and sheer dogged determination. After tough Commando training including learning how to shoot Webley & Scott revolvers, Charlotte volunteers to go into Vichy France as a courier. Her superior asks her, ""Why do you want to go to France? You know only 1 in 3 come back."" Her real reason is that she hopes to find her RAF fighter pilot paramour with whom she has fallen madly in love. He had been shot down over Nazi occupied France. Parachuting into France in the dead of night, she links up with a French Resistance group and its dashing leader who confesses to her he is a Communist. I used to parachute and the parachuting scene is very well done as she lands amusingly right in the middle of a group of French boys. Her first contact, a French lady, is quickly arrested by the French Vichy Police in a Cafe but does not betray her. Charlotte has many deadly adventures with the Maquis including derailing trains with plastic explosives, and sees the ugly side of war plus the horrific effects of Hitler's anti-Jew policy. The French Maquis leader even wants to kill her when he mistakenly believes she has betrayed his group to the Nazis. They were all machinegunned down in a merciless Nazi ambush. The French Resistance leader's father is subsequently arrested by the Nazis for having Jewish blood and deported in a cattle truck. His enraged son takes revenge on the evil French philandering collaborator by shooting him dead in the heart without saying a single word. A very professional job!
Charlotte manages to escape back to bombed out London and meets her fighter pilot paramour whom she had believed to be dead, KIA (killed in action). There is no happy reunion because she is now in love with the French Maquis leader. Ah, women are always fickle...
Charlotte tells the boyish RAF pilot, ""You're right about war. It makes fools of us all..."" However, there is a really happy ending as she returns to France after the war to find her true love in his ancestral home, and delivers her classic line, ""There's something I've been meaning to tell you."" He replies, ""What?""
Cate Blanchett says softly, ""My name...Charlotte Gray.""
A very moving scene. It brought tears to my eyes. Please watch this movie and see if it touches your heart too.

So when Cate Blanchett's character is air dropped into occupied France (24 minutes into the film) a member of the French resistance asks, ""You are...?""  ""Dominique Guilbert,"" the 'former' Miss Gray responds, as they remove her from her parachute.  ""Welcome to France, Dominique.""  Thus begins her work as a British agent; having told her lover earlier that she too wanted to be brave, thus when her soldier-friend goes missing in France she decides to follow.  She had studied French when she was younger so they presumed that she could pass herself off as a Parisian.  For effect, in the beginning of the film, Miss Blanchett does utter some words of French, but not a word of it while in France itself.  Apparently, the makers of this film thought it be better if we only made believe all were speaking French (as all the characters speak nothing but English; or, I should say, all of the French and British characters, for the Germans do utilize their native tongue on occasion. Late in the film, for example, a Vichy French hack asks this of Michael Gambon's character: ""Do you have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race?""  Then tells him that ""the aim of collaboration is, and always has been to safeguard the independence of French citizens.""  Simply put, such dialogue in English loses its import in my opinion. There's a fine Czech film about World War Two (Dark Blue World) that starts in Czech and thence when that film's characters make it to England intertwines Czech and English throughout the remainder of the film.  I wish they would have done likewise with ""Charlotte Gray.""  An above average film (such as this one is) set in war-torn France simply ought to have some French in it, I should think.  It would have improved the film, in my opinion.  Notwithstanding this criticism, ""Charlotte Gray"" still (albeit barely) works as a film.

The way the story unfolds seems erratic and non-uniform, but what can one expect from such a complex storyline in only 2 or so hours? Kate was remarkable in this film and so too was Billy Crudup. It's easy to see past any minor wardrobe flaws or any weaknesses in the unfolding of the plot, as the main focuses are the emotional and symbolic components, which were done well!

  An unconventinal love story, ""Charlotte Gray"" shows the struggles of ordinary people amidst dire circumstances. Setting love aside to fulfill what she felt were her obligations in the war, she discovers that it was in fact love that lead her to accept her role in the french communist resistance.

 While searching for her lost love, she becomes attached to the characters in her 1945 French village and unwittingly ignites a new and unexpected flame. Charlotte soon finds her true nature; revealed in the challenges and struggles that she faces. In the end, the film leads into Charlotte making a seemingly unexpected choice....",1129939200,7,1144,4.811224489795919
1442425,3,B00005JKTE,"The movie is beautifully photographed, crisply acted by an outstanding cast, and of course it stars the flawless Cate Blanchett.  In spite of all the knots in the story (and there's kind of a lot), this movie is genuinely humane and interesting, and it's worth your time because it has two unusual qualities that movies these days tend to lack...

1. Real honest-to-God empathy.  In the space of a pretty short time (say the first 20 minutes or so), ""Charlotte Gray"" connects you in a genuine way with the strange intense heartache that young people caught in wartime feel -- Charlotte gets swept up in a kind of desperate whirlwind romance that only people who are really living next to death and radical uncertainty can feel.  There's a unique kind of sorrow in being forced by the world to live minute-to-minute, trapped in History's clutches, and the movie captures that.  Yes, we are at war as I write this, but our entire civilization and existence are not at stake quite the way they were 60 years ago... and the movie captures somewhat how people trying to be in love at that time must have felt.

2.  One of the movie's greatest flaws is also its biggest strength: the story becomes so overcrowded and chaotic that it starts to actually resemble real life in the sense that, ""I have NO IDEA what is going to happen next!""  That feeling has got to be particularly acute in wartime, and in Charlotte's case (foreign agent leading double life behind enemy lines) it's completely nerve-wracking.  The story verges on being incoherent (structurally speaking, not morally speaking), but in today's movie climate of pre-packaged three-act structures with predictable breaks at every moment, that's kind of... refreshing.  Maybe I'm a naive viewer, but I really couldn't tell what was going to happen next, from moment to moment, and that kind of unpredictability is rare in movies these days (at least Hollywood ones).

But of course, that same incoherence is what keeps the movie from developing a true center of gravity, and so it keeps it from being great.  The whole theme is so incredibly overcrowded (let me get this straight: she's an undercover agent AND an active member of the French Resistance AND she's searching for her downed-pilot lover behind enemy lines AND she's hiding Jewish children from the Nazis in her farmhouse?!?  Any ONE of these would have been more than enough for a slew of movies.)

The most nerve-wracking scenes are the small ones, where normal people caught in strange situations simply DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  That's a real human emotion, and a scary one.  The scene in the cafe, early on, is plain terrifying.  It's too bad the filmmakers didn't focus more on smaller strands of plot, which to my mind were already incredibly large.

Not a 'great' movie, but a good (and beautiful-looking) one... and one that will maybe help you to be more human.",1126310400,6,2885,4.805668016194332
1442486,5,B00005JKTE,"A little somber and not nearly enough wild and crazy ""shoot `em up, bang, bang"" scenes for many contemporary movie-goers, but superbly acted, wonderfully choreographed -- and the movie soon immersed me in a tale of love's lost and won, bravery and a desperate struggle against the occupying Nazis during the French resistance...

One wonders whether such heroism exists today among the common folk, but the tale is all the more compelling as the character, Charlotte, is based on the real-life valor of the special operations agents working deep behind enemy lines and far out of reach of any help.  It was a deadly game... one either lived or died and there wasn't much in between - the odds of returning from these missions were not good.  But desperate times compelled desperate acts and the picture ""Charlotte Gray"" tells the tale in a compelling, human way that soon drags the viewer right in there with her.

This is one of my favorites.  I've watched the movie several times - but only when I have enough time to watch it straight through.  This is one flick where interruptions are not appreciated.",1124409600,3,1106,4.794736842105263

While it's not hard to see why American audiences didn't go for it, it's harder to understand the malice European critics greeted it with. It's a pretty good portrait of resistance infighting (the Communists are setup by the De Gaullists as liberation approaches), local collaboration (the schoolteacher gladly helps the Nazis root out Jewish families) and the nuts and bolts of resistance work. No great heroics or big setpieces, which is probably why it tanked: the big climax is more an emotional risk than the rescue audiences probably wanted. Performances are mostly good - Blanchett is much better than contemporary reviews would have you believe in particular. There are better films, but it's a good movie and for my money better than the alright Lucie Aubrac. I liked it enough to buy the DVD.",1120262400,3,926,4.980645161290322

There was not enough chemistry or building of a relationship to believe for a minute that she'd go all the way back to be with the French resistance fighter.  Especially when she lets him flee alone without her and she returns to London.

1442489,4,B00005JKTE,"This certainly is a beautiful movie to look at, sumptuous photography, a beautiful score, so what went wrong with it?  Director Gillian Armstrong (MRS. SOFFEL, LITTLE WOMEN, MY BRILLIANT CAREER) suffuses it with so much atmosphere, she didn't realize her plot became too far-fetched and squandered the considerable talents of her cast.  Cate Blanchett, recently awarded an Oscar for playing Katherine Hepburn in THE AVIATOR, glows in the title role.  Cate was born to play heroines from the forties, with her high cheekbones, dreamy eyes and gorgeous hair; and as an actress of considerable merit, she makes the best of a character we never fully understand or know.  How can she fall so helplessly in love with a one night fling?  Granted, Rupert Perry Jones is a fine looking lad, but Cate's character appears to be too intelligent to invest so much of herself in such an unfulfilled relationship.  From there on, the script bounces her around so much, we never fully understand exactly what her role in France is.  And why worry with her knowledge of French when everyone in France either speaks English or German?  Even Julien's father (played wonderfully by Michael Gambon) has a flawless British accent.  Credit Billy Crudup for doing so good in his sketchy role as the Communist French underground hero.  The film seems incredibly long, but it's not truly boring; it just doesn't impact us the way I think Armstrong wanted it to.  But any movie with Cate Blanchett is worth seeing just to see this glorious actress do her best, even when she isn't given a lot to work with.",1110931200,5,1580,4.858208955223881

It seems the film attempts to stay faithful to the book, and so the impression one gets is that the director tried to compress a complex and multi-layered story into a couple of hours.

The story is good but very predictable bordering sometimes on caricature. But nonetheless it is all very entertaining and the actors are good. It reminded of the older 1950's and 1960's war

movies, very far removed from the new and very realistic wartime dramas (""Band of brothers,...).

1442492,5,B00005JKTE,"There are numerous movies about the soldier, Jewish, and American points of view on WWII, but there are hardly any describing the ordinary civilians' point of view, the civilians in Europe anyway, and what it was like for those whose lives and homes were invaded. It shows ordinary people doing extraordinary things, such as leaving the comfort of home, jumping out of planes, blowing things up, etc. In all the hubub of the Jewish plight and the brave soldiers, one tends to forget about the silent heroes, the resistance groups, those who hid complete strangers from the Nazis, and the French officers who fudged Nazi law to help their countrymen (which by the way, is not just a movie twist). On a sentimental note, it was excellent that she went back to France instead of getting back together with the pilot; the French guy was SOOOOOOO much cuter. The only disappointment I found was not knowing what happened to the father and the kids.

1442494,3,B00005JKTE,"Cate Blanchett is too good of an actress for the title role in ""Charlotte Gray.""  I liked her performance, but the film did not really click for me because too many of the characters do too many stupid things.  In the context of this story these stupid things matter because most of the film takes place in Vichy France where stupid things can get you killed.  Adapted from Sebastian Faulks' novel by screenwriter Jeremy Brock, ""Charlotte Gray"" is about a Scottish woman who is doing what she can for King and Country during World War II.  Because she can speak fluent French, this means working on radio communications with the French Resistance movement.  But we get the feeling that she wants to do more, and certainly we think that she is capable of doing more; after all, this is Cate Blanchett.

Then one evening at a party Charlotte meets Peter (Rupert Penry-Jones), a young airman.  Apparently they fall in love.  This matter is in doubt somewhat because they spend one passionate night together and when he gets shot down over France, Charlotte she decides to join British Special Operations, be trained to be a special agent, and dropped into France in the general vicinity of where Peter is supposed to be hiding with the Resistance.  It is certainly fortunate that Charlotte is sent by her King and Country to where she wants to go, but it is the impulsive decision to go through all that training that bothers me.  The French Resistance would be trying to get Peter home, so that it is not like Charlotte should be expecting him stay in one place until she shows up to rescue him.  What Charlotte is doing would be like finding out that a loved one has a medical problem and then rushing off to medical school to become a doctor so that you can save their life.  There has to be an easier way.

But that actually does not matter because once Charlotte makes contact with the Resistance group she has a whole new set of problems.  The leader of the group is Julien Levade (Billy Crudup), who happens to be a Communist.  Charlotte's cover as ""Dominique"" is that she has fled Paris and is working for Julien's father (Michael Gambon).  There is a mission to blow up a train that Dominique gets to go along for absolutely no reason that I can think of given that her single talent is that she speaks French (well, and English).

Then we have the moment where the bubble bursts.  Nazis march into the provincial French town and Julien stands up and starts screaming curses and the names of citizens who had been killed by the Germans and/or their French collaborators.  Dominique finds another talent useful for shutting Julien up, but even over the noise of the tanks the Nazis (and/or their French collaborators), should have spotted the angry French guy and taken out a Luger to shut him up.  But this is a film where the hero is betrayed by one of those collaborators not because he is the Nazi hating communist who leads the French Resistance in that neck of the woods but because it is seen as a way of forcing Dominique to submit sexually.

Charlotte might have come to France for Peter but for Dominique the big concern is a pair of young Jewish boys whose parents have already been sent away to a ""work"" camp.  The boys are hiding with Levade's father and since Dominique is a woman she is put in charge of them, which basically means trying to keep anybody from discovering them.  This, more than finding Peter or resisting the Nazis, becomes her mission and it appears to be the hardest one of all.  The most memorable moment in ""Charlotte Gray"" concerns the one small victory that she can manage in the overwhelming situation in which she finds herself.

There are three parts to the ending of this film, and what they underscore is what we suspected all along.  That Charlotte Gray really was in way over her head when she redirected her life.  In fact, if this film had ended with Dominique still in France, I would have had a higher opinion of it.  Instead, the point is muddled by making a point of finding out what happened to the film's unstated love triangle.  I can see how both Blanchette and director Gillian Armstrong would see the character of Charlotte Gray as being a stronger one than we usually find in World War II movies, but they still should have seen her problematic elements as well and have had them rectified before making this movie.  The performances by the principles are quite good, but they do not make up for the flaws in the story.",1099440000,3,4482,4.56625
1442495,3,B00005JKTE,"This is a crude story filled with ambitious and fineness handle camera . The photography is exquisite , the arresting images : specially this turn around the train is unforgettable but the entire script doesn't have punch . It is well told but you feel the absence of greatness . May be is the stylish documentary storytelling and the not succesfully developed sense of the drama what it strikes the film . But Gillian Armstring knows as all of we there are been so many stories about the tragedies of the war where the sense of heroism , betrayal, fatality and injustice are fundamental factors of the war . In that sense Armstrong focuses her attention much more in the dramatis personae experienced by Charlotte Gray that in the environment which surrounds her .

The Gray chase in the house lacks credibility . Do you really expect it is so easy to get out and escape from the Gestapo with a simple gun ? .

The dramatic device employed for Armstrong when the train is leaving and her efforts for writting a letter seem a filled tear handkerchief thrown to the great audience .

But the splendid perfomance of Cate Blanchet (one of the best twelve actress in the world to date) and a worthable cast saves the film being a positive point .

One of the most emblematic paradoxs in the film is you can find your expected love in the middle of the hell.

The most remarkable acting after Blanchet is obviously Billy Crudup as Julien Lavarde .

But the film will not remain in your memory . You and me will forget very soon . And that it may be a weakness syntom of the film itself.",1098662400,,1581,4.43448275862069
1442525,3,B00005JKTE,"Having loved ""Shining Through"" for half my life, I am enamored with romance tales set in the frantic times of war. Charlotte Gray had so much potential, it's a great-looking and atomospheric film with well-shot scenery and transporting period pieces, but it's allowed to wither away under lethargic pacing and a painfully diffuse screenplay.

Blanchett pitches in a disarming performance as Charlotte. For a spy she sure cries a lot but does well to get herself out of a pinch. When the hero of the film, played quite handsomely by Billy Crudup, tucks away two Jewish boys at a crumbling shed (ice-cold cliche alert) she becomes the unofficial nanny. In short, she gets to enjoy 1940s women empowerment while also being fussily maternal, bringing a warm human dimension to wartime spy games.

Problem is, we stumble from antic to dull antic without much focus and even our wondrous heroine can't help feeling equally confused, summing it all up perfectly with ""I don't know what I'm doing here anymore"".

I still give it three stars for dabbling in rewarding themes, such as questioning the meaning of bravery or acknowledging how war's extremes can be transforming, but the campy dialogue doesn't help much. All too often the film's Wise Ideas sound like they came straight from chinese fortune cookies, like ""War makes fools of us all. The rest it kills"". Um, ok.

While I enjoyed the cinematography, I didn't care for Charlotte's character. Her romance with the pilot seemed superficial to me. Her convictions to help France, had all the genuineness of a dogma spouting cultist. And, I'm sorry... But if I were selected to be a spy, I would hope I'd do more than play housekeeper.

1442529,5,B00005JKTE,"This film contains one of the most memorable performances by any actor of any time.  Cate Blanchett puts an absolutely immaculate performance together with strong performances by a supporting cast.  She plays an English woman who goes to France as a spy in hopes of finding her love who was a member of the British RAF.  His plane went down in France and no one is able to tell her if he is dead or alive.  What she finds in France is a completely different world.
As soon as Charlotte arrives in France she faces the tragedy that comes with being a spy.  Instead of retreating in fear, she presses on clinging to the hope of finding her love safe in France.  She ultimately becomes much more involved with her new life and identity in France.  She is involved in attacks on German forces, the hiding of Jewish children, and many other dangerous missions.  In the process she falls in love with another man.
This movie is paced very well.  Each scene flows directly into the next.  Cate Blanchett will ensnare you with the tremendous bravery exhibited in the character of Charlotte Gray.

1442530,3,B00005JKTE,"...the story of Charlotte Gray, who risks her life as a spy behind the enemy line during the WW2, is all based on the historical truth about those brave women who parachuted into France occupied by Germany...  ""Charlotte Gray,"" starring Cate Blanchett as the title role, is a film not to be missed for me.  And it's Cate Blanchette, so many films in these four years, and not a single bad performance with so many different roles.  So why not see this?  But sorry, I was very disappointed with it (not Cate, who is fabulous as ever).
Charlotte Gray, as I said, is an English secret agent in occupied France with the false identity.  But her original motive was more than love for the country (which she has plenty); she wanted to seek for information on her missing love who was shot down in France.  But after she landed there, she realizes that her mission is far more dangerous than she thought, and moreover, she has to be in charge of two boys who, if found by the authority, are certain to be sent to concentration camps.  While deeply engaged in her work with the Resistance leader Billy Crudup, and his father Michael Gambon, her original purpose is forced to give way to more immediate needs; that is, survival of herself and her mates.
The director Gillian Armstrong gives gorgeous costumes and pictures of France.  As she did in her excellent ""Little Women,"" Gillian Armstrong gives very credible portrait of countryside, but as to the script, the result is simply lamentable.  Many flaws can be seen -- uneven pace and unfocused tone of the whole picture, for instance -- but the most damaging is very unconvincing love story between the characters.  Despite the best efforts from Blanchett, Billy Crudup does not look like a guy with whom Charlotte is likely to fall in love.  Even the main character Charlotte's actions are inconsistent, sometimes making us wonder what she really wants to do.
Inconsistent may be the best way describe the film's flaws.  After trained in Britain to speak French fluently, Charlotte drops her French language completely once she arrived at the country.  Is this for subtitle-phobias?  If so, they should have known that such careless decision for mainstream audience would kill the reality of the film.
But as for cameleon-like Cate Blanchette, she deserves unanimous praise from all of us, who have seen her films with wonder.  Most regreattable thing is that obviously Billy Crudup is no match for her, and even veteran Michael Gambon suffers from the  underwritten screenplay.  ""Charlotte Gray"" is, therefore, for those fans who want to see another testimony that Cate is one of the best actresses of 21st century.

The main focus of this movie is not the war in itself, but the effects of the war on people's lives, which is the only reason I have a thing for war stories. It is amazing to see ordinary people transformed into courageous heroes just for survival.
This story is mainly a romance, in my opinion. Charlotte is willing to risk her life to travel to France in search of her lover, a pilot who went down over France and who is now trapped in its borders. But she is distracted from her mission by the plight of two little Jewish boys whose parents have been arrested. She and a handsome ally take the boys into hiding and care for them. But there are spies and informers everywhere who are more than willing to betray their former friends and neighbors. Charlotte finds her loyalties torn between two countries, two identities, and two men.

Those two strong points are blended to great effect as Cate Blanchett's extraordinary beauty is presented against several breathtaking backdrops. Cate Blanchett conveys a very rich poetic substance which makes everything else around her seem prosaic and that is the problem with this film, everything except Cate Blanchett and the beautiful landscape seems prosaic. The supporting cast is not bad but they just do not compare with that central actress. The male actors who play Cates respective lovers seem to have been chosen for their profiles moreso than for their acting talent as neither are any kind of match for Cate so we don't believe she would look twice at either of these men she is supposed to be in love with. There is one other actor in the movie that is good and thats the grandfather but his character remains merely a background figure. The story is also a little unlikely. Sending a young girl with no discernible talents except her ability to speak French into a dangerous situation without any real task to perform seemed ridiculous. The whole time she is in France I was trying to figure out what her mission really was but could not figure it out.
Visually this movie will entertain you and Cate amid those great backgrounds will please your eyes and poetic sense as a painting would but the various elements of this story just didn't ever come together.",1039305600,2,1517,4.838461538461538
1442534,2,B00005JKTE,"Cate Blanchett can't be faulted for her portrayal of a British (Scottish, actually) agent of the Special Operations Executive in France.  But the story is thin, predictable, and isn't worth your time.  She falls in love with a RAF pilot who you just know is going to be shot down over France.  Somehow in her grief she makes it through SOE's rigourous psychological testing and gets sent to France with the private ulterior motive to find her lost love.  Unbelievable point number one.
When she gets in country, she's dressed like the belle of the ball, complete with a new hair colour and fabulous clothing.  No one in France in WWII was wearing well-fitted, new clothing unless she was the mistress of a high-ranking German officer.  Also, she has too many changes of clothing, certainly more than fit in the case she carries.  And no agent worth her salt would colour her hair and risk it growing out while she was being detained by the Feldgendarmes!  Cate's cover is housekeeper of a man who owns a run-down estate.  She wouldn't have had a tube of lipstick, much less lipstick that always looks perfect.  Unbelievable point number two.
I rented this movie because I am a WWII re-enactor who portrays an SOE agent (in Belgium, though, not France) and I am always looking for good movies to recommend to people who know nothing about the SOE.  Well, this ain't it!  Not only does the movie make terrible visual mistakes, it oversimplifies a very complex situation.  Like most American films, it treats WWII as if it was all about Jewish people being put into concentration camps.  MANY non-Jewish people were also sent to concentration camps for various reasons.  And the Nazis had numerous other agendas than exterminating God's chosen people.  Also SOE didn't drop agents into occupied countries to help hide Jewish kids.  They were there to equip and train Resistants, derail trains, blow up bridges, and communicate German positions and troop movements via wireless back to London.  The great success of the French Resistance was that, by derailing and incapacitating trains and roadways, they prevented enough German reinforcements from arriving in Normandy until the victory was already decidedly in the hands of the Allies.  This common oversimplification of the French situation into a fight to keep Jewish people out of danger practically infuriates me.  EVERYONE in occupied France was in constant danger of losing their lives, not just Jews.  It was a hellish situation.  I did find something redeeming in the scenes after the credits.  The director recalls shooting the scene in which the German tanks roll into the village and some of the real villagers started weeping.  Over fifty years later, and these people still cry when they are reminded of the horror they endured during the War.  I am rather certain that these villagers were not solely of Jewish extraction.  To beat the dead horse of the Holocaust demeans the sacrifice and loss suffered by the Gentile population of occupied Europe.  That is a terrible sin.
The most offensive character in this movie was Cate's contact who wished he was back in Birmingham.  And the idea that he was given a chance at jailtime or serving in the SOE is ludicrous.  While SOE used ex-cons as trainers in sabotage and subversion, they were well-cleared and not ""straight from the dock"".  SOE did not and could not afford to recruit untrustworthy people.
The cold, unfeelingness of London's orders may have a grain of truth, however, but England was never known to allow a Resistance cell to be exterminated on purpose (although some argue that this was the situation with the Dutch cells in 1942-43), and they certainly wouldn't set up a bunch of good anti-Germans just because they happened to be communists.  It is true that England was wary of working with Communists, it has been shown time and again that they would ignore their political affiliation as long as their dedication to irradicating the Nazi menace was strong.  As was the case in Tito's Yugoslavia, the French Resistance's hatred of Hitler outweighed everything else, although they were always suspicious of English assistance.  Directly after the War, SOE agents were practically deported to prevent England from having any control in French political matters.
To the non-thinking reviewers who were angry that Blanchett didn't speak fluent French the entire time, get over yourselves.  Do you really want to have to read the whole movie?
If you want to watch a good movie/series about SOE in France, get ""Wish Me Luck"".  It's a 6-part series about fictional SOE agents, their training and their operations in occupied France.  It lacks the namby-pamby love story of ""Charlotte Gray"" and the characters are intensely more likeable.",1034640000,7,4761,4.974715549936789
