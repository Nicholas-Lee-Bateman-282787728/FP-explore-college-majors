2877889,4,B000S0GYRK,"Since I'm an Argento review virgin reviewing Argento (at the coercion of some fellow Amazon denizens) during our annual Horrorween month celebration, I'll start from the beginning.  I happened across&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B000S0GYRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>&nbsp;one night on cable.  ""Love at first sight"" is the only pertinent phrase to describe the feeling.  That is how I discovered Italy's macabre national treasure, Dario Argento.  Since then we've crossed paths often, be it his collaborations with personal hero&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Romero/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Romero</a>, the B-movies he's produced like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Demons/dp/B000T28POC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Demons</a>, or the occasional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/giallo/dp/B000FAK9VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">giallo</a>&nbsp;-a genre he owns like no other, but is hot and cold for me- but I've never been able to recapture that ""this is the greatest thing ever"" feeling I got from ""Suspiria"".  The closest were his entries into Showtime's outstanding&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-Horror/dp/B000RIWAV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of Horror</a>&nbsp;series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jenifer/dp/B000FS2W3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jenifer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pelts/dp/B000KJTFBG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pelts</a>.  And now here we are, with the first feature-length Argento-directed film since that fateful night that I have enjoyed front to back.

""Opera"" is the story of a singer, Betty, who is forced to stand in for the injured star of a production of Shakespeare's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macbeth/dp/0743477103/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macbeth</a>, a play that has long been believed to be cursed.  She owns the role and  becomes an overnight sensation.  Then the killing starts.  A masked assailant begins a horrific ritual of tying up our protagonist and taping a row of needles under her top eyelids so that she is unable to even blink without drawing blood.  He then lies in wait and proceeds to brutally kill whatever friend or lover attempts to come to Betty's rescue before cutting her free and going on his merry way.  Why?  Well that's complicated; best to let you figure that one for yourself.  You've got your brutal Argento-rific deaths, your pack of birds not to be f#@ked with (quoth the raven, ""mmmmm, eyeballs yummy!""), some really cool opera scenes, your creepy little girl spying on people in her apartment building through an air-conditioning shaft, and yes, your utterly inappropriate blasts of 80's heavy metal music. I haven't decided if it's obnoxiousness is charming or annoying, but I'm glad Argento represents.

Cristina Marsillach is beautiful.  The girl is as captivating as they come whether she's in full-on opera garb belting it out, conversing with her co-workers, enjoying the beauty of nature maybe a little too much, or running braless down the street from her mysterious stalker.  She is just a joy to watch in this film.  The opera itself is very cool too.  Argento added another layer of cred by making the director of the production a horror filmmaker crossing over into theater.  The giant skulls and live croaking ravens on the stage set look absolutely killer and the costumes are pretty sweet as well. The tension in the film is well-played and the release is always a blast.  Argento's trademark technicolor lighting gets a little bit of a workout in a scene or two.  I don't know why it is so creepy and cool when it should just be a distraction, but I love the visuals that are created by this out-of-order color scheme that Argento likes to play with at times.  Often imitated, never duplicated.  Thought I was going to talk about horrible deaths first didn't ya?  I'm not that shallow.  Or am I just saving it for later to make you think I'm not?

Wait's over.  ""Opera"" features some amazing deaths.  Gotta love the ol' knife through the lower jaw and into the mouth gag.  Get's 'em every time!  Then you've got your close-ups of knife entering flesh which never stops being unnerving, and of course the fight with a clothes iron over a little gold trinket.  Seriously.  But the show stopper here is a work of true and utter genius.  It's a death that has inspired countless others in it's artfulness, inventiveness, and (almost) unexpectedness, and is even more impressive when you consider that modern filmmakers need a million dollars worth of CG to attain anything close to the same effect today. Italian horror filmmakers really are a breed apart.  That scene will likely put me off of peepholes for some time.

I wish ""Opera"" was perfect, but it just isn't so. First off, giallos (and slashers in general) aren't really my thing, though I do appreciate them. On the other hand, I must say that I also loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Have-You-Done-to-Solange/dp/B000065B05/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Have You Done to Solange?</a>&nbsp;so perhaps the genre is growing on me.  There are a few parts in ""Opera"" where the scenes played out in such a fashion that I was literally annoyed by what I was watching.  The battle for the trinket is one such scene.  I don't demand realism, but don't be stupid either.  No one is fighting a masked assailant over a crummy bracelet knowing that people have been murdered while their friend is mysteriously tied up in front of them.  And nobody is going down for the count because a clothes iron hits them in the back either.  Awful sequence.  It also kind of robs the killing scenes of their emotional impact when we are hearing cheesy metal the whole time and we're supposed to be feeling for poor Betty being forced to watch.  The needles under the eyelids didn't actually look very convincing, the ending was kind of odd, and I guessed who the killer was the first scene he was in. I can't even point to a specific reason why, I guess I just knew by some ingrained understanding of film conventions.  Maybe Queen B's horrible sixth spoiler sense has rubbed off on me somehow.  Dread the thought.

This is my second favorite Argento film that I've seen so far but there are, of course, more to see.  This is an entertaining film of any genre and fans of Argento, murder, mystery, and murder-mysteries need to give this a shot.  It stops short of being a masterpiece, but it's not that far off, either.  Woopak (he's got you all in check!), and Mackshere: this one's for you guys.",1224374400,4,6919,5.834825870646767
2877890,5,B000S0GYRK,"THE NEEDLE EYELID SCENE =======>

Arguably the most unfathomable tragedy that could be inflicted upon a person would be the heinous murder of a loved one, right before your eyes.  Imagine being forced to watch this, totally helpless, as your companion suffers an agonizing death.  Completely traumatizing.
Argento feeds on this fear with precise tension and oppresive cruelty.  A homicidal maniac ties up the main character and tapes packets of needles underneath her eyelids.  A simple blink becomes excruciatingly painful.  This detained woman is forced to gaze at the vicious murder.  And the way this killing is fashioned is just bloody brutal.  You will be left in a horrified stupor.  Argento orchestrates this fatal crime with a penetrating audacity.

BULLET THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE =======>

Keep in mind that this film was made over two decades ago.  The aesthetic maneuvering of this moment has been rehashed countless times in Hollywood.  It is nothing short of brilliant.
Two women are trapped in an apartment.  The killer is just outside the door, claiming to be a policeman.  We are only given glimpses of the intruder as she looks through the peephole.  This forces us to connect with the desperation and uncertainty that the woman feels.  Of course we sense the danger, but have a shred of comfort since the perpetrator is outside the locked door.
And then, it happens...right before our eyes.
We see an extreme closeup of the bullet.  Our vision is concentrated on it as it slides through the chamber of the peephole.  Entering and exiting through the woman's head.  Just a quick, instant death, and we're left dazed.  And with a stroke of horrible luck, the phone is taken out simultaneously with this single shot.  Black comic genius, I love it!

______________________________________________

You would be hard pressed to find two better scenes in any horror movie.  Heck, any movie period.  Superb filmmaking.
Opera might get some criticism due to the acting, voice dubbing, or elaborate plot details that might be hard to follow.  But I feel sorry for those who can't feel the impact of this magnificent horror film.  I implore you to give it another try.

Death by Dario is heavenly",1223942400,2,2203,5.00828729281768
2877891,3,B000S0GYRK,"If there's one thing I look forward to in the mail, it's an Argento movie. I loved some of his other films and couldn't wait to grab this movie. In the end, the overall plot is wonderful, though poorly executed. All the characters' personalities seem a bit off, one way or another. Too stiff, too strange, etc. And then there are MANY loose ends that keep the viewer hoping they will be answered at the end, but they aren't (for example, the anniversary necklace/bracelet, what is its meaning?).

The actual plot itself, though, is superb. The twists and especially the final revelation of the killer himself are excellent, especially the manner in which they reveal him. The murders, or even the attacks (there are some where the people don't actually die), are just amazing and intense. I honestly wonder if I've seen such brutal murders anywhere else before.

I still like this movie and recommend it if you are a horror or Argento fan for at least the plot and murders, but the acting and characters may get you a tiny bit.

Also recommended: Suspiria, Deep Red, any other good slasher movie

***- 3 and a half stars -***",1213833600,,1125,4.63819095477387
2877892,2,B000S0GYRK,"I am giving this movie 2 stars merely for the fact that it confused the HELL out of me and managed to leave me with way too many minor issues to truly love it.

  The movie is about a young Opera understudy who finally gets a shot as the lead in a rather dramatic stage production of Macbeth, when the prima-donna star is hit by a car.

  Argento is a HIGHLY skilled director and his movies are extremely eerie and visually stunning. Even the dizzying, odd angles that make you feel sick are there for a reason. He is an amazingly morbid creator of the macabre. A talented visionary who knows how to extract fear from a viewer. A master of horror.

  However, Opera had WAY too many weird character reactions for me to truly love it.

  For one, if you were tied up and forced to watch people get butchered while you had needles taped to your eye balls, would your first instinct be to run off and take a walk in the rain? The main character was WAYYYYYYY too nonchalant about the terror that was unfolding. Wouldn't you run and get help? Wouldn't you be a little more disturbed about what had just happened in front of your own very eyes? But, alas, she just takes a leisurely stroll in the rain and goes home to rest-Like nothing happened!

  And what was up with the weirdo costume maker who is getting attacked and acting like she's being tickled? I've never seen a victim in a horror movie LESS scared than this woman-it was kind of strange and I'm still not sure if it was the actress or the actual scene that left me baffled.

  Then there was the weird little girl who had a passage to the main characters apartment where she would spy on her and listen to her sing...and when our heroine finds this out she merely chuckles and shrugs it off....UMMMMM, wouldn't you be a little more upset if you found out someone had been spying on your private life at home all the time??? She sure wasn't!

  If there is one thing Dario does well it's GORE! You watch his films expecting the worst of death-scenes...and he almost always delivers! He uses it in such APPROPRIATE ways...He doesn't use it just to be gory or gross people out. He uses it as a means to freak you out and show you how brutal death can actually be. The goriest of the scenes would be a knife stabbing upwards into a man's neck and you can see the blade cutting up through his mouth-Reminiscent of the Heart slicing scene in Suspiria. It was brutal! But, I never view his gore scenes and question why he did it or complain that it was too much.

  I will always wonder if actual ravens were killed in the ""raven massacre"" scene. Some of that looked oddly real and I couldn't help but remember the mouse-eating scene in Inferno-where a cat kills and eats a live mouse (which you can see struggling in the mouth of the cat until it dies)-which always bothered me. But, I was glad those screeching ravens got some revenge at the end!

  I could go on and on about scenes that bothered me....but, I won't. This movie would have gotten 3 maybe even 4 stars if not for those strange character issues and inconsistancies.

  The end scene reminded me of The Sound Of Music with a twisted sister soundtrack. I didn't understand the heroine's ""I LOVE NATURE!"" outlook after her final attack. It was just odd. It did bring me flashbacks of Jennifer Connelly in Phenomena though.

  Overall, It was a really weird movie to me and it left me a little empty inside. Give it a try if you have seen other Argento films and are familiar with his filmmaking.",1212624000,3,3511,4.377125193199382
2877893,4,B000S0GYRK,"Following an accident involving the female lead, Betty makes her singing debut in an operatic production of ""Macbeth"". However, as everyone knows, ""Macbeth"" is cursed, and a psychotic fan surfaces, whose idea of fun is to tie Betty up and force her to watch him murder her co-workers. Will Betty solve the mystery and find the killer before he strikes again?

Many fans of Dario Argento believe that he was at his peak during the period between ""Deep Red"" and ""Opera"", making this the last of Dario Argento's great works. It's not as good as ""Deep Red"" or ""Suspiria"", both of which are considered to be his masterpieces; the plot is slightly confusing in places and I have yet to see a film that is as visually stunning as ""Suspiria"". Nevertheless, it is still an excellent film, and if ""Deep Red"" and ""Suspiria"" did not exist, this would probably be considered to be a masterpiece.",1206230400,,882,4.690322580645161
2877894,4,B000S0GYRK,"""Opera"" is a bizarre Italian giallo from director Dario Argento.  For unknown reasons, someone is stalking a beautiful young opera singer (she resembles Heather Langenkamp of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" fame); the killer likes to tie her up and force her to watch the butchering of her friends.  ""Opera"" reminds me of Dario Argento's earlier giallo masterpieces such as ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage,"" ""The Cat O' Nine Tails,"" and ""Deep Red.""  It is far better than his recent movies such as ""Phatom of the Opera"" and ""The Stendhal Syndrome,"" i.e., the ones that star his daughter, Asia Argento.  It is definitely better than the ones he did for Masters of Horror - ""Pelts"" and ""Jenifer.""  They were gross!  ""Opera"" has a musical score that rocks, unique death sequences, and beautiful sets that remind me of ""Deep Red"" with their abundant use of blues and reds.  The revenge scene of the ravens flying and swooping through the opera house was memorable.  Better acting and a higher body count would've received five stars from me.",1200873600,,1034,4.868571428571428
2877895,4,B000S0GYRK,"First of all, the reviewer who gave this dvd release a single star is retarded. Many of the actors actually spoke english for the film, twit! You obviously have no idea about the history of giallo, nor the history of the european film industry in general at that time...sheesh! I may be overreacting but 1 star is just ridiculous! Rate the FILM for what it is! NOT FOR WHAT YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE!!!!

OK, deep breath.....the dvd is of good quality. I think it might actually look better than AnchorBays release. I already have the two-disc A-B version, but watch this blue-underground disc more for that very reason.

I won't go into what the film is about as other reviewers already have, i'll just say that it is an above average giallo, an underrated giallo. The acting is way, way above average for this genre! Also, it has some of Argentos most memorable set-piece killings and is saturatted with his style. This is the last GREAT Argento film, imho. He faded a little after this and never really captured his earlier genius.

Great buy. Not one star but a solid 4 star effort by Argento and this dvd is well worth the price.",1197072000,,1131,4.534313725490196
2877896,5,B000S0GYRK,"A lovely young opera singer gets the main starring role for the opera production of ""Macbeth"" until a psychopathic killer captures her sometimes and makes her watch her friends being massacred. She alerts the police to investigate these horrific crimes and to find out who is the mysterious psycho or she will have to find the killer herself before he gets to her.

Fantastic Italian psychological horror thriller from masterful Italian horror master Dario Argento with great style and dark atmosphere accompanied by gruesome gory violence such as the woman looking through the eyehole of a door then the killer shoots through which inspired the one scene in ""Saw 2"", good camera-work, excellent cinematography and a haunting music score. Sure the storyline isn't coherent but this is an excellent thriller with scares and shocking sequences that are quite memorable, this is one of Argento's best movies and a must see for fans of the genre.

This DVD is basically a re-issue of the excellent Anchor Bay re-issue which has excellent picture and THX sound quality with extras like a 36 minute featurette of interviews with the filmmakers and stars, trailers, music video by Italian rock group Daemonia and bio of Dario Argento.

2877897,4,B000S0GYRK,"As much as I enjoyed Opera I have to admit I'm kind of surprised at the reaction it gets from fans. Whenever you see a poll of the best Argento movies the most common one to take top spot is Suspiria. And I have noticed if it's not Suspiria a lot of the times it's Opera, which ranks in the top spot. Opera was the last film of the 80s that Dario Argento made and overall it was a solid way to close out the decade in, which he gave us so many classics. But as great as Opera is there are some things in my opinion that just don't fully work.

The screenplay written by Dario Argento & Franco Ferrini was at times kind of weak. As I have stated in the other reviews I have written for movies by Argento, his writing is the only weakness. He started off as an excellent writer, but after that he wrote some good screenplays, but the movies were all about the visuals. Some of the things the characters say can be a bit silly and even their reactions to things don't make a whole lot of sense.

Christina Marsillach stars as Betty and I have to say of all the women in a Dario Argento movie she is my 2nd favorite. Nobody can take top spot away from Asia Argento. The thing is Betty is kind if a flawed character. She doesn't always have the smartest things to say. And her reaction to seeing some brutally killed she is horrified, but afterwards she seems rather calm and ok like nothing happened. Despite the flaws of the character I did find her quite likeable.

Most of the other characters really don't have much depth to them and this I would say is one of Argento's weaker scripts. There is also a scene or two than can be kind of silly, but despite all that Opera is still a fantastic film in Dario Argento's career.

Upon my first viewing I didn't quite like Opera, which actually has happened when I watched other Argento movies, but seeing them again you begin to notice things you didn't before. Argento has that going for him. You can watch his movies multiple times and pick up on stuff you didn't notice before and you will find yourself enjoying the movie this time around and if you liked it the first time you might find yourself liking it more.

The power of Opera simply comes from Dario Argento's directing. With any other director I think Opera would have probably been a silly mess of a film, but Argento doing what he does best makes this movie work so much more than maybe it should have. First things first the visual side is mind-blowing!

From just a pure visual side I don't think you will see a better looking film than Opera. The camera work is amazing. I would even go as far to say it's a better visual film than Suspiria even if not as enjoyable or creepy. The POV shots were excellent. I don't think there is a filmmaker out there that can do a POV shot better than Argento.

The use of colors in Opera also adds so much to it. If you thought Suspiria and Inferno looked amazing you have to see Opera. The usage of the red, green and blue lighting was without a doubt stunning! The scene in which Betty and Mira played by Daria Nicolodi are trapped in the house with the killer roaming around might be the best looking scene ever crafted in a film. From the shot selection to the way the colors change. I was totally blown away!

My biggest complaint though with Opera is the music. The music in Argento's movies was always brilliant. Early on he worked with Ennio Morricone and than Goblin. And it's Goblin Argento will always be linked with. As much as I love Morricone, it was Goblin that really made Argento known for what he is. His brilliant visual style and their score was a tough act to follow.

But starting in 1985 with Phenomena and even seen in the Argento produced Demons and Demons 2, he got into this metal phases where he started using metal rather than a simple score by Goblin. Here in Opera it's a sort of weird. The use of the metal music in some weird way does add to the movie, but it also breaks the tension up at times. Claudio Simonetti of Goblin does provide some music, but it's not the typical music he is best known for when working with Argento.

Dario Argento knows how to create suspense not many know how to craft a build up as well as he does and the kill scenes are always so well shot and are damn creepy due to that. Now you have Goblins music going over that. Now in Opera replace that with either opera music or metal and suddenly the suspense and tension drop just a little bit. When the characters are on stage I don't mind the opera music, but in a more suspenseful scene is when I feel it shouldn't have been used.

Opera does feature some tense moments. Dario Argento is a master of the genre and he doesn't fail to deliver. There are some creepy moments and there are some moments with a lot of tension, but the music used does take away, like I said in some ways the music does add to the scene, but it also loses something. I would love to see Opera rescored by Claudio Simonetti or Goblin. I personally think it would make the movie a lot better.

When all was said and done I still think Opera is a fantastic film by Dario Argento and would easily rate in my top 10 favorite films by him and one of my favorite horror movies of all time, but I think the use of music did take away at times. A lot of people rate this as Argento's best and if Goblin scored it I think I might agree.

The kill scenes were all well-done. The murder scene about 30-min was really graphic and so well shot. Every movie I see by Argento I was say that was one of my favorite kill scenes and I have to repeat that again. Though as a whole Opera might feature his best murder scenes. They are violent and even quite mean. With Argento's visual style along with the murder scenes help elevate Opera.

When you watch Opera you are gonna watch it for the visual aspect; that is without a doubt the strongest thing about the movie. Anyone who watches Argento always know we are gonna get one great visual ride and just from a visual stand-point this just might be the best.

The only other problem with Opera is it goes on a little too long. The final scene really felt tacked on and wasn't really needed. Opera really should have wrapped up about the 95-minute mark but goes on for another 10-minutes. The scene wasn't bad it just wasn't needed and was a tad bit silly.

In closing Opera is an excellent movie by Dario Argento despite some flaws. It's not a perfect film and wouldn't make my top 5 Argento flicks, but it's still a damn good and very fun movie by the master Dario Argento.",1192924800,2,6544,4.261079774375504

Whenever the killer catchers her, he constrains her and forces her watch to watch the people in her life get butchered. A great movie with all of Dario Argento's ""signature style"", with the wooden acting, kooky story, very impressive camerawork that just makes you think, awesome kills, a dreamlike atmosphere at times, and a soundtrack you can't help but notice! I loved the film. I had fun watching!

The DVD's presentation of the film is GREAT!!! Its looks crisp and clear. The dubbed audio sounds clear and I have no complaints with it. It looks great!

The extras consist of Opera's US and International trailers, a text bio of Argento, a music video that didn't intrigue me, and the best special feature being a 36 minute documentary of how the film was made. I enjoyed listening to many of the people who worked on the film with Dario. It was well edited.

2877912,4,B000S0GYRK,"Most Argento fans love his sense of dark poetic visual story telling and Opera is one of his best. I just wish I had it on Blu-ray since I only have the old Anchor Bay DVD release which isn't bad but doesn't offer the Italian language with english subtitles. If you like murder mysteries you might like this and start collecting Argento's catalogue of great films. His giallo films do exploit a sparse use of slasher elements and mild gore, sometimes shocking but it's more a plot highlight to pull the story along.

The only problem I've come to notice over the years is that Argento misses out on empathy since he never lets us get to really get to know the characters in a deep everyday human capacity, they are always face value abrupt introductions and if they aren't eradicated by the murderer/antagonist within a couple of scenes then you're left with the befuddled protagonist who we also never really get to know aside from them being clamoring for clues to who's out to do them in, HENCE... oddly one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for as they were murdered was the gay private detective in Four Flies On Grey Velvet lol and I'm not gay but his character actually inspired humor and it was sad to see him die the way he does... I only mention this because out of all the Argento movies that fact made me realize the lack of empathy I had for the victims. This is because Argento never allows them to develop in a way that makes the viewer feel for them. I can't recall if the female lead/love interest in Deep Red dies or not, but I also found her funny and charming... I don't think she dies though.

Opera features what I think is his most ghastly death scenes/murders, I'll just leave it at that... there is the scene where the seamstress? get's killed and the sights, sounds and images of her death are almost unmatchable for me, I tend to skip it because I don't ever want to get to enjoy such sadistic murder even if it's just simulated.",1398556800,,1966,4.428176795580111

2877919,4,B000S0GYRK,"Wow. What a pleasant surprise, if that can be said about a film which features several decidely unpleasant DEmises. I can't believe I let lukewarm reviews make me put off seeing this one for so many years! I thought it was great!

Now, don't get me wrong, I love Argento's films like SUSPIRIA and DEEP RED for what they are- often fever-pitched, nightmare-logic, saturated color labyrinths. However, OPERA has a solid narrative which almost completely makes sense without suffering for it. Also, almost all the acting is quite good and I found myself truly caring about almost every murder victim, unusual in my experiences with Argento's other films. It was an added layer of characterization which enhanced everything else about the story.

My only significant problems with the story were a few significant lapses in common sense judgement- I won't be spoiling anything by saying that, once again, I found myself wondering why someone who's been threatened by a stalking maniac wouldn't turn on every light in their apartment. And, occasionally, the heroine shows a distracting almost blase' attitude after witnessing some truly horrible events. This may have been intended to show her in shock, but, if so, I felt it wasn't entirely successful.

One aspect which didn't bother me nearly as much as I expected was the occasional use of loud, generic Italian heavy rock music. It's SO infrequent and for me it actually works within Argento's contrasting images (and the wonderful editing) of beauty and brutal violence. In an ideal world, I'd like him to have chosen something, well, BETTER, but, it didn't spoil or distract me from immersing myself in the movie experience.

The camera-work, lighting, set design and editing are SUPERB without being distractingly ""hey look! this is arty!"" Almost everything works without being too carefully melded together. The violence is shocking as ever, almost more so in places where we only HEAR what is being done to someone. The music overall is PERFECT. And the ending, while puzzling, was more thought-provoking than outright annoying.

This is the work of a true, dare I say it? maestro with more to share and show and tell than to prove and shock with. I look forward to watching it again and again.

Oh! And, the dubbing isn't half-bad either! QUITE the accomplishment for this type of and era of film.",1329868800,4,2353,4.989795918367347
2877920,5,B000S0GYRK,"Dario Argento is probably the greatest horror movie director of our times. His work have been recognized and praised all over the world now. He is up there with the bests: GEORGE  ROMERO,LUCIO FULCI,MARIO AND LAMBERTO BAVA, MICHELE SOAVI, BRYAN YUZNA,STUART GORDON ........

He's well known for putting his characters in impossible and endless situations. His profound use of colors and unique cinematography quickly became is trademark. He gave us numerous  classics over the years such as SUSPIRIA, DEEP RED, INFERNO, THE STENDHAL SYNDROME,DEMONS,SLEEPLESS, GIALLO and many more!!!!

Opera is one of my favourite from him, its about Betty, an opera singer who's being asked to replace the lead in Verdi's opera ""Macbeth"". Unexplainable Murders will quickly starts to happen around betty and the Opera's Staff and personals. Sometimes the killer is even  forcing betty to watch him kill as he places tape under her eyelids with needles attached to them so that she can't blink....crazy stuff!!!...good entertainment!!.... Betty will have to try and figure out what's the killers plan and why is he doing that to her and others around her in the theatre. Then she will finally have to confront him.....

Again the use of colors and the impeccable cinematography in the film are astonishing!!!! The soundtrack is pretty cool too and often goes from opera to heavy metal, which is another one of Dario's trademark

Truly a remarkable film!  Another 5 stars well earned for a real piece of art!!!!

2877922,4,B000S0GYRK,"Marco Baddini's production of Macbeth is suffering from a number of unfortunate accidents which seem to be related to the opera's illustrious curse. After the lead is struck by a car, a beautiful young ingenue assumes the role of Lady Macbeth in her stage debut, but an unseen admirer will go to any length to ensure her success! OPERA is a refreshing return to form for Italian director Dario Argento, and it is one of his more artful, stylish, and technically accomplished Gialli. Here, he combines the power and grace of the opera house with his own frenetic energy and violent murder sequences. Argento could not have picked a more appropriate backdrop for the film, since Macbeth already contains such a fierce character drama and a rich history of problematic productions. The stage is then set for him to unleash his next black-gloved killer, although the curse of Macbeth would strike closer to home throughout the course of its making.

Argento creates a number of striking images that are contrasted by the utter horror in OPERA. From the elegant set designs to the extravagant deaths, every frame of the film has a painterly quality about it. That being said, he also slips in a few self-serving scenes that are beautifully composed but completely unnecessary. The first trails a bullet from the barrel of a pistol through an eye-hole and then out the back of one character's head. The next involves a series a swooping crane shots that are used to imitate the raven's eye view as the birds search for the killer.

As with many of Argento's pictures, the soundtrack plays a huge role in the final production of OPERA, making this one of his strongest scores since SUSPIRIA. With Goblin disbanded, Argento would only go back to Claudio Simonetti for two arrangements (including the main theme). In addition to the classic operatics that were taken from Macbeth, he also cranks up the volume during several Heavy Metal tracks that play over the murder sequences. While this adds to the excitement and terror, the jarring shifts in music are more painfully artificial than they had been in DEEP RED or TENEBRE.

OPERA's killer is more sadistic than ever, not only eliminating his victims in a variety of gruesome fashions, but also forcing poor Betty into watching him kill by tying her up and taping sharp needles beneath her eyelids. The theme of voyeurism is essential to the plot, and plays into every aspect of the film. Unfortunately, OPERA is no less contrived than any of the director's other thrillers, and the gory centerpieces still take precedence over the actual storytelling, itself.

While many fans often choose to ignore many of Dario Argento's films following his 'decline' with PHENOMENA in 1985, OPERA should be considered one of the director's last great works, and one that is sorely overlooked despite the fact that it is one of his more accomplished achievements.

2877923,2,B000S0GYRK,"Opera (Dario Argento, 1987)

It is a matter of some debate where, exactly, Dario Argento's career began to go so horribly wrong. Pretty much every Argento fan I know is in agreement that he was consistently making fantastic films at least until 1977 (and his two finest, Profondo Rosso and Suspiria, are getting high-profile Hollywood reboots next year, with the latter directed by David Gordon Green and the former by no less a personage than Argento's pal George Romero). The fan base begins to drop around Inferno, which shares the cheesiness of Suspiria's ending but doesn't quite manage to pull it off as well as it was in that one. From there it's a gradual slide until you get to 1996 and The Stendahl Syndrome, which I've heard more than a few people say is his last good film. (There are still a few diehards who are willing to go to bat for Non Ho Sonno. I have yet to hear anyone try and defend anything he's done since The Card Player, with one exception: me. I thought Jenifer was a return to form, however short-lived. Otherwise, I'm in the camp that says the decline started in '80.) And thus we come to Opera (also known as Terror at the Opera), which sits right smack in the middle of the period of decline, and you'll hear quite a few Argento fans saying this was his last great one. There are also quite a few critics who say that Opera is the pinnacle of Argento's theatrical camerawork, that sort of oversaturated, cheesy, yet glorious style that defined Argento's movies starting right around Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1971). It was nominated for Best Film at Fantasporto 1990, which sounds prestigious until you realize that there were forty-nine other films nominated (and the nominees included such timeless gems as Clownhouse, Robot Jox, and The Toxic Avenger, Part II; the eventual winner, for the trivia-minded, was Mike Hodges' Black Rainbow). And the camera-work faction are right; there isn't a prettier Argento flick out there. But does it hold up as a film?

Co-written with longtime partner Franco Ferrini (who started working with Argento with Creepers), Opera is the tale of Betty (The Sea and the Weather's Cristina Marsillach), a young understudy who achieves success after a suspicious accident takes out the reigning diva. She soon realizes that there's a killer on the loose who seems tied to her in some way. This is confirmed when the killer forces Betty to watch some of his crimes using an ingenious device that will not allow her to close her eyes during the crimes. Eventually the police get close, but will they find the killer before he escalates things?

To me, the cheesiness starts overpowering the movie pretty soon after we start, and while it does let up on occasion, there never seems to be a point where the story could stand on its own without the gore scenes. That was the big thing that separated Argento from the giallo standard; earlier movies like Four Flies on Grey Velvet and Profondo Rosso had strong, well-written stories that could have easily stood without the gore (as opposed to more conventional giallo tales like Fulci's Don't Torture a Duckling or Bido's The Bloodstained Shadow, where the thrill of watching is intimately tied to the violence). Here, the best scenes in the movie by far are the death scenes (at least one person in the film is said to have taken the role specifically because of its death scene, though telling you who would constitute a major spoiler), and the rest of it exists to build up to those. (Contrast, say, the comedic romance subplot between David Hemmings and Daria Nicolodi in Profondo Rosso.) As well, the movie was plagued by problems (Argento has stated that Marsillach is the most difficult actress he'd ever worked with, and was himself convinced after a death on set that a Macbeth-style curse plagued the production), and whether enough of them were overcome to come up with a coherent, workable movie is another question for debate.

Opera is probably the Argento film that is most divisive among fans and critics alike. It has both its rabid defenders and its withering attackers. At the end of it all, I find myself in neither camp, and in all honesty I'd probably have rated it higher had it come from a director who I was less sure was capable of turning out masterpieces (seven Argento films are in my top thousand; two are in the top thirty alone). It's watchable if you're into that sort of thing, as are most giallo movies, but it's nothing special. **",1281052800,,4475,4.725992317541613

2877926,5,B000S0GYRK,"I've always found there to be something unsettling about operas.  I don't know if it's the often-dark themes of murder, suicide, and betrayal, the tragic endings, or the lovely voices that, after three hours, sometimes seem to morph into migraine-inducing caterwauling.  Given my taste in films, theater, and books, I suspect the latter.  It's not that I don't appreciate the opera, I just need for it to be in smaller doses.  Which is exactly what I got in Dario Argento's 1987 thriller, ""Opera"".  Set against the backdrop of an avant-garde production of ""Macbeth"", there are a few snatches of sopranic trilling here and there, and then it's back to the heart of the film: a stylish, colorful murder mystery involving a comely, ambitious young opera singer and the seriously twisted killer stalking her and her inner circle.  The additional kick is that the killer is able to grab the singer at any time, tying her up, propping her eyes open, and forcing her to watch as her friends are viciously (and graphically) mutilated and slain.  As usual with Argento, plot takes a back seat to lush cinematography, atmosphere, and inventively gory murders.  For many directors, this could be a fatal blow, but with a masterful filmmaker of Argento's caliber, this only serves to enhance the film's mystery and cachet.

Although they are subjectively different, there is a certain similarity of cinematic styles and themes that, I believe, link Dario Argento to that great American surrealist, David Lynch.  There is a certain dark, daring, ""out-there"" sensibility that can be found in each director's work, and it's seems like the films of one director compliment the films of the other.

The acting isn't bad in ""Opera"", although you get the feeling that some of the actors are basically winging it.  Gorgeous Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, the up-and-coming diva, with panache and style; onstage, as Lady Macbeth, done up in a slinky, form-fitting gold number and matching skull cap, pointing a pistol and belting out an aria while live ravens swirl around her, she's death personified--a kinky, lusciously deadly Mata Hari.  Offstage, as the more innocent Betty, her cool sexuality is far more subtle, yet unmistakably there.  When she seeks help from the men in her life--boyfriend, director, police inspector--it's with the helpless expectancy of a lewd Lolita; the innocence is all surface.  She thinks she's frigid so she needs someone to help her out (the masked and gloved killer is more than willing--at least that's what he says).  Such paves the road for the psychosexual undertones of this tense thriller.

The late Ian (""Chariots of Fire"") Charleson is also featured in the film, along with Argento's ex (and Asia's mother) Daria Nicolodi, Urbano Barberini, William (""Copycat"") McNamara, Barbara Cupisti, and Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni, as potential victims of the maniac.  Nicolodi is (as usual) impressive in the role of Betty's agent/surrogate mother, as is a very young William McNamara as Betty's would-be boyfriend.  But the film really belongs to Argento, and star, Marsillach.  Her Betty is probably one of the most complex and believable of Argento's heroines.

The only real problem I have with this film is the ending, which seems tacked on; appropos of nothing, it plays like a psychotic vision of ""The Sound of Music"".  However, after giving it more thought (than it probably merits), I'm thinking that maybe this small portion of the film (or possibly even larger sections) is taking place in the post-breakdown mind of a heavily traumatized Betty.  That analysis could be wrong, but the ending does seem to make more sense when viewed in that context.  And, to be honest, that analysis is what put me in mind of David Lynch in the first place.

All in all, an excellent film that has far more depth than what many might realize, ""Opera"" is trademark Argento and ranks as one of his finest.",1227484800,,3911,5.026356589147287
