8479682,1,B005MR2O3C,"Waste of time and money. I purchased this DVD hoping it would show interesting sites in NJ. It started featuring Wildwood, NJ where it spent 10 of the tapes 50 minutes on a marbles contest on the beach. BORING! Its more of a commercial for portions of the tape such as Medievall Times rather than a tape about popular sites in NJ. Dont waste your money on this as it is just boring and plain awful.",1431475200,3,398,4.25
