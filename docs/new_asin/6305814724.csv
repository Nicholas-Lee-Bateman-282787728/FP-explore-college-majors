1081827,4,6305814724,A routine but enjoyable western yarn that was pretty violent for its time (the fight between George Peppard and Slim Pickens in particular).Dean Martin goes against type as a villain out to destroy Jean Peter's stage  line. It's up to hero George Peppard and crusty old John McIntyre to set  things aright - which they do amid much gunfire and fisticuffs.,960595200,,355,4.80327868852459

1081909,4,6305814724,"I hadn't seen this except forty years ago on black and white TV. I was surprised at the color saturation, as well as just how wide-screen this was shot (2.35:1).  There are great, hardboiled lines here, some of which I still remembered, and George Peppard's gleeful reading of ""Sixty-four come August"" is as funny as I recalled.  Most of the supporting actors aren't that great but the action scenes hold up quite well, especially the Peppard/Slim Pickens fight mid-way through. Also, it has that great dynamic I remember between Peppard and John McIntyre, where the lead actor is basically a sidekick to an older man; the only other western I recall seeing that in was Kevin Costner's Open Range, which shares some other similarities to this (outsiders taking on a town boss, rallying the previously cowed populace). Open Range is better, but this is still a tough, no-nonsense western and a whole lot of fun. And Peppard had one of the great hats in western history.",1468972800,,968,4.825301204819277

George Pappard comes to town and although Simmons tries to get this ex deputy marshal to stop Dean, he refuses. But then matters change.

cruel, corrupt town boss whose only true virtue lies in his absolute lack of any form of humanity.  Well-filmed and directed with a solid cast carrying the film along in high fashion and a sustain sense of good versus evil.

Though I ordered ""Rough Night In Jericho"" and had a packaged something mailed to me that REPRESENTED itself as being ""RNIJ"", I'm sorry to say it was NOT what it represented itself to be. It came FACTORY-SEALED.....SUPPOSEDLY from the Universal Vault series (and because it WAS factory-sealed in plastic it was NOT Amazon's fault that this disaster occurred)...but, when I opened the DVD case (which had Geo. Peppard  & Dino on the cover) I found inside it a CARTOON FEATURE from the WARNER BROS. ARCHIVES (NOT Universal). What I found was titled ""A FLIGHT OF DRAGONS"". NOT what I was expecting AT ALL!!!  I therefore give fair warning here to anyone interested in purchasing this particular film in the future. Beware. You might be getting something you haven't bargained far.",1389571200,,974,4.8969696969696965

1082034,5,6305814724,"This movie is a winner for me.  I like every one of the actors.  I didn't like to see Dean Martin as the bad guy but when he played a bad man, he was a BAD man.  He was good in the role, pure charming evil.  I also enjoyed Slim Pickens as the underling bad man.  He was rough, nasty evil as opposed to Flood's smooth, subtle brand.  I will watch a movie just because George Peppard is in it.  It's why I watched this one the first time.  Dolan was pure charming, subtle, tough as nails good.  The plot has no surprses but sometimes, if the plot is decent, it doesn't need any.  It just flows and is comfortable.  You don't have to see the part after the big fight to know Dolan winds up going home and marrying Molly, running the stage line and not winding up owing 51% of everything.  It is a satisfying movie and a real keeper.  I would recommend it to any Western fan.",1356566400,,871,4.052941176470588
1082035,4,6305814724,"It is an enjoyable 95 minute movie that includes violence that is a cut above what was allowed in TV shows of the decade. It also features three movie stars with the rest of the cast drawn from TV shows of the 1960s. The movie has the feel of an episode from ""The Virginian"" or ""Gunsmoke"" on steriods.

An interesting piece of trivia is John McIntire having a role in a movie that uses the Shiloh ranch house as Dean Martin's ranch since he played the owner of Shiloh in the ""The Virginian"". They did not bother to change the look of the house except to remove the Shiloh sign over the entrance gate to the ranch.",1344470400,,613,4.239316239316239

1082037,3,6305814724,"A thoroughly B movie Western plot elevated by some surprisingly good performances into a perfectly enjoyable oater, this 1967 Western is probably most notable for having Dean Martin play the `bad guy', Flood.  He is an ex lawman, that, for reasons never fully explained, has gone bad.  The town he helped clean up is now ruled by him with an iron fist, and he has his stake in all the businesses in town - except for Molly Lang's (Jean Simmons) stagecoach.  She brings in ex Marshall (John Mcintyre, adding some old style Hollywood class) and his ex Deputy Dolan (George Peppard) to run the stagecoach.  When Peppard sees the mood in the town, he figures as a gambling man the odds are against him, and he decides to stay on the sidelines until he can leave.  But how long will his conscience stay unpricked as the situation deteriorates around him..?  The story is all `been there, done that', and the photography and music are very much Hollywood churning the latest of hundreds of Westerns - so it's slickly done, if uninventive, and yet it certainly has a surprising streak of violence in places.  Someone shot in the face, fist fights to the death, Martin smashing a man's face off the bar until he is unconscious... perhaps the desire to compete with the European Westerns which were popular by this time?
On the whole though, Peppard is surprisingly amiable company, and holds his own against Martin, who is a show stealer with his role as Flood.  Martin was not taken entirely seriously for his acting by many, and yet here he brings probably the only 3 dimensional character to the movie.  Flood has charisma, is likeable to a point, is understandable, and yet has a mean streak and occasional temper that make you completely believe in the town being terrified of him.  Simmons on the other hand is a fine actress but her role seems to start well but goes nowhere.  Watch out for Slim Pickens playing.. well, Slim Pickens.  The gunfights work fine, if really nothing new, the fistfights are, as mentioned, quite brutal, and so the pace keeps moving along quite nicely.  All is shown in a very clean and bright transfer, in, as far as I could tell, original ratio which showed off the able cinematography nicely.",1341705600,,2221,4.67866323907455
1082038,5,6305814724,"Universal Pictures has literally dug into their vaults for this rare, intense sixties western,Director Arnold Lavin's 'ROUGH NIGHT IN JERICHO'-1967 made when the Euro Western was making a dent in the genre and the states were holding on to the old tried and true oaters.  It's the same old story, a one time lawman turns megalomaniac and decides to run the town of Jericho but the stubborn stage coach owner refuses to give up her rights.  After sending notice to a former US Marshal to come and defend the town, the marshal is accompanied by his assistant who slowly realizes that right makes might.  The film is an intense experience under the wonderful performances by George Peppard, Jean Simmons, and John McIntire but the film is truly owned by Dean Martin who graced many Westerns but here turns in a truly villainous performance.  Martin was never taken seriously in his film work and mores the pity when you see such excellent work such as this.  His Alex Flood character is truly amazing and on repeated viewings makes you really grasp his relentless grip on his order of the town.  With beautiful images by Photographer Russell Metty and a nice music score by Don Costa, we are witness to the last of the truly by rote American Westerns of the late sixties and Lavin pores on the intensity to the last frame. Peppard gives his always heroic performance and Simmons gives her role a grittiness which never seems to be realized.  Highly recommended to all Western lovers and those who only thought Dino was only a show business singer. Along with Director Andrew V. Maclaglen's 'BANDOLERO'-1968. its his best performance ever. Universal releases it in a crystal clear 2.35 DVD-R transfer with no extras.",1337904000,4,1712,4.822525597269625

1082058,2,6305814724,"Dean Martin played his only villainous role in this utterly forgettable Western drama from Universal Studios. ""Rough Night in Jericho"" (1967) boasts a solid cast, but the Marvin H. Albert-Sidney Boehm script offers few surprises. Despite his best efforts, cinematographer Russell Metty cannot elevate Arnold Laven's made-for-TV directorial style.

1082060,5,6305814724,"This is a very enjoyable movie for western buffs of the mid-1960's before Hollywood forgot 'how' to make good westerns.

The cast is sensational comprised of many seasoned and well known actors with one of my all time favorites, George Peppard, turning in a strong performance. George has the role of a man forced to take a hand literally in a battle for a town, one with which he tried to avoid. But Dean Martin plays such an unscrupulous and moral bankrupt part that ole Dino eventually brings the roof down onto his head through Peppard, whereby Dino loses everything.

This is a good way to wile away a few hours while being entertained, there just are no bad actors in this unusual and fine western. Great fun.

Semper Fi.",1195430400,5,727,4.576923076923077
1082061,4,6305814724,"Dean Martin plays the bad guy in this one, and he does a good job being ruthless, cold and completely without conscience.  George Peppard plays the anti-heroic hero, typical of westerns (and many other genres) in the mid 1960's.  Jean Simmons is great as the female lead, stil very lovely at 40-ish, playing a tough but vulnerable woman with guts and determination.  JOhn McIntyre is great as the aging former sherriff who can still teach the young guys a few lessons.

The plot is fairly simple, quite unrealistic and certainly nothing new for a western -- the bad guy came to town as a lawman, slowly bullying his way into 51% ownership of every business in town.  One business owner (Simmons) is still holding out, refusing to be intimidated into selling out.  She is trying to run a stage coach line - with only one stage coach - and has brought in McIntrye and his protege Peppard for help.  They have become part owners in the business.  After an initial reluctance to get involved, and a few cat and mouse games with Dino, Peppard finally throws his lot in with Simmons in a big way.  They fall in love during the proceedings, of course.  The final showdown between Dean and his henchmen and Peppard's crew is an old fashioned shoot-em-up, blow-em-up melee.

Pretty violent by 1967 standards, though mild compared to Peckinpah's contemporaneous work.  The lynching scene at the beginning has the power to disturb, and Dean smacks Jean Simmons around in another scene.

Very little humor, except a few of McIntyre's saltier remarks, and one scene in which Simmons and Pppard try to drink one another under the table.

Peppard and Simmons make a good romantic pairing, considering the fact that she was several years older than him.",1189036800,7,1737,4.765886287625418
1082062,4,6305814724,"I saw this one when it came out.  I remember at the time that it savaged by the critics as too violent.  I saw it again recently on tv and I remembered that comment and laugh.  You see this came out in the middle of the Italian westerns. The Italian westerns were beginnig to turn to violence to keep the audience that they had started with the Dollar movies. American westerns were  just trying to survive, so they looked to the Italians for help. JERICHO was more violent than what US westerns were but not violent enough for the Italian western audience. This caused this one to die which was a shame.  JERICHO had good blood lines.  The story was based on a AL Cody novel and had very ""cool"" actors in Martin and Peppard.  The story is tight and the characters are well drawn and the violence...well later American movies and American audiences took to violence with black ganster moview and biker movies.  God for bid that someone try to change the American western.  JERICHO today is a very good western and one must keep in mind the time in which it was made when they watch it.

1082064,4,6305814724,"Dino made a number of Westerns, everything from the comic Western Pardners with Jerry Lewis, to a whodunit Western, Five Card Stud with Robert Mitchum, to playing an alcoholic lawman in Rio Bravo. But Martin had a field day playing the villain in Rough Night In Jericho, a hard-bitten, violent movie.

Martin plays Jason Flood, an ex-lawman who has taken over the town of Jericho. George Peppard and John McIntire plays former lawmen as well, who have been contracted to provide a stage to Jean Simmons, who Flood is trying to force into going into business with him. Flood is also an ex of Simmons, which makes him even more determined not to let Peppard and McIntyre help her out.

Things get increasingly violent until the final showdown, where the blood flows freely. Everyone is good in this film, fro mthe three leads to McIntire, who was always superb, particularly in Westerns, as well as the great Slim Pickens as one of Flood's henchmen. Rough Night In Jericho is overlooked, but it's very entertaining.",1108425600,29,1013,4.816091954022989

Add in some innocent people who get hurt and then the one thing that pushes Peppard who then Has Had Enough.
