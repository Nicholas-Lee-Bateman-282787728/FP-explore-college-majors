8673492,2,B00MOYBG7G,"This was VERY disappointing! It comes straight out of the movie ""Seventeen Miracles,"" which I absolutely love. I thought this would add some depth or information to her story, but it doesn't. If you've seen ""Seventeen Miracles"" you have already seen it all. If you haven't seen ""Seventeen Miracles"" then buy it instead. This was a complete waste of money.",1529366400,,355,4.933333333333334

8673496,3,B00MOYBG7G,very disappointed!  Nothing that wasn't in another film.  It wasn't worth the price I paid or the time spent on it.  It might have been if I hadn't seen the same thing in another film.,1421798400,,184,4.2
