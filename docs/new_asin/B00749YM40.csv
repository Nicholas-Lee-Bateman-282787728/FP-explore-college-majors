5053863,5,B00749YM40,"I bought this DVD only a month ago and the results in my perfromance have been dramatic.  I like the fact that you can do the drills and excercises in your living room or practice range and everything an amateur golfer like me needs is on one DVD that I can reference, whether it is my short game or driving.  I finally feel like I am in control of my swing.",1333065600,,358,4.028169014084507
5053864,5,B00749YM40,"Having read the book, ""A Swing you Can Trust"", I was impressed with the stunning visuals and easily understood instruction in the DVD.  The ability to select a particular area of the game you want to focus on and digest the information in discrete sound bites is a real plus.

I am a 10 handicap and found the instruction a wonderful combination of feel and technique.  His creative approach actually makes practicing golf fun. Roberto's personality shines throughout in a comprehensive golf video for players of all abilities.

This DVD is highly recommended and makes a wonderful gift!",1344902400,,587,4.959183673469388
5053865,5,B00749YM40,This is my favorite golf instruction video because it simplifies the golf swing and provides drills that help you experience how your swing should feel.  I recommend getting both the video and the book.,1344470400,,202,4.9411764705882355
5053866,5,B00749YM40,"This DVD is awesome....with one major criticism.

Borgatti's swings & strokes are smooth and efficient, he looks great lifting weights and stretching... but yoga? No way Jose!  It would be like the yoga model teaching us golf.

In the yoga poses Borgatti looks ridiculous, even uncomfortable. I do, however, respect his bravery.  Probably few golf instructors would be open and comfortable enough with themselves to go barefoot and `downward dog' next to a yoga professional with superior form & flexibility.  At least she's up front.

Despite failing in 1 of 50 videos- two thumbs up on the other 49 !  It's a complete program, and keeps you watching. Amazing what they packed into one DVD.  Sand play on the beach and the boxing gym were my favorites.  My bunker play has improved dramatically with the `neutral shaft' technique and I'm getting phenomenal distance off the tee with that punching bag image in my head.",1340323200,,919,4.915584415584416
5053867,5,B00749YM40,"Hitting drives down a highway, on a beach, swings from the edge of a cliff !... Initially I thought, are you f'n kidding me? I admit the hot fitness model compelled my purchase...What sold me later is the content of the DVD, which is incredibly comprehensive and detailed.  There is ZERO fluff, and the vids are super high quality! Even the more sensational shots illustrate key points - line up properly, the ball doesn't move, and trust your swing/stroke.  I have a complete library from Jack to Phil, and this is easily the best golf instructional video ever!  Where the hell is Longboat Key?",1340064000,,595,4.701923076923077
5053868,5,B00749YM40,"I was very pleased with this golf video. The instructions are clear and concise. It's easy to comprehend and not overly complicated like other golf instruction. I am a pretty good player, and think it'll help golfers of all levels.  Finally, the scenery is spectacular, and quite original. I thought bunker play on a beach was fun and creative-- made me want to book a trip to Longboat Key (which I never heard of before seeing this video). It looks like the perfect place for my next golf trip.",1336089600,2,495,4.561797752808989
5053869,5,B00749YM40,"I've owned the book for several years and it has been a great resource for improving my golf game.  Now, I can't say how excited I am that A Swing You Can Trust is available on DVD.  The book and DVD work in perfect tandem to reinforce my application of a repetitive, trustworthy golf swing. The DVD is comprehensive and extremely well done. It covers all aspects of the swing, short game and trouble shots and includes great exercises to get you physically ready for your next trip to the tee box.  I highly recommend both!",1335052800,3,524,4.4375
5053870,5,B00749YM40,"As a PGA Teaching Professional, I am always keeping an eye and an ear on the pulse of our industry to see if I can pick up some new skills which can help me teach better in my everyday work. Roberto Borgatti is one of just a few peers who consistently inspires me with his unique brand of simple yet effective training techniques. I must come clean, and admit that I have ""borrowed"" a few trademark Borgatti gems, first from his refreshing book, "" A Swing You Can Trust"", and now from this video with the same title. Roberto's greatest contribution to golf instruction, I feel, is his holistic approach to aquiring the proper swinging motion of the club with the arms and body. For those who like to keep it simple, look no further. Nobody will ever accuse Roberto of being overly ""technical"". But don't mistake ""simple"" for ""incomplete"". Clearly, at work beneath the surface of this easy-to-follow regimen is the creative mind of a true expert of the golf swing. Only when you intimately understand something that is, by nature, quite complicated, can you reduce it to its bare essence. I highly recommend this video (and the book as well!) to anyone hoping to learn an effective and repeatable swing. Bravo, Roberto!",1334448000,2,1218,4.696261682242991
5053871,5,B00749YM40,"I have played golf for 35 years including over 12 years as a professional having played with a number of PGA tour players and nationwide players. I have seen many players get too focused on position and lose sight of motion and sequence in there swings. I feel Borgatti's teaching method gets it right by teaching the correct motions training the body to use the big muscles so you can repeat your swing under pressure. I found these videos help me to keep thing simple by quickly training me to get the correct motion so that I can play more fluidly with out having to focus on mechanics. Wheather your just getting started or a seasoned player these video instructions will be a trusted reference to help you master every aspect of your golf game. Presented in an easy to understand format for any level player, A Swing You Can Trust takes a complicated game and presents it in an uncomplicated manner. Golf is a game of sequential motion and Borgatti gives you practical drills to master and repeat those motions in an efficient and productive manner so that you can learn to create a fluid swing instead a series of unconnected movements.",1333929600,4,1142,4.630541871921182
5053872,5,B00749YM40,"I got the DVD, and what I most loved were some of the feel techniques, like closing your eyes while putting or trying to put and not spill a wineglass.  This instructor takes an intuitive, ""feel"" approach to golf.  In an era where even players like Tiger are ""overstudying the game"", I feel this video gets you to connect with a golf feel on different shots.  After all, it is a sport and we are not swing robots.  This DVD is perhaps best for beginners and intermediates, but as a 6 index, I got a lot out of the drills as well.

Highly recommend!
Alex",1333929600,4,553,4.228571428571429
5053873,5,B00749YM40,"I bought this reasonably priced DVD hoping to pick up just a few pointers for my game. However, this DVD packs in 50-some lessons across all areas of the game that I found priceless. I wasn't expecting any fancy graphics or video tricks but I must admit, the way that the graphics tie into the lessons really made sense - especially for a novice golfer like me. I appreciated the fact that non-technique tips, like exercise, were also included in the collection to give a more holistic view of the game.

What I learned from this DVD for $30 would have probably cost me $5000 from a golf pro over the course of 5 years. Money very well spent.",1333324800,5,642,4.394957983193278
8509665,5,B00749YM40,"Roberto's tape could have saved me thousands of dollars in golf instruction over the years.  His instructions are simple, sound, and easy to remember.

  Easy to understand format, helps you with all aspects of your game.  View it at least TWICE before you pick up a club is my suggestion.

Also, gives swing drills that can help a lot.

 Is an instructor at Longboat Key  Club resort in Florida, where he charges about a grand for an all-day lesson.  Sounds steep, but you'll be glad you did.

Roberto is fond of all his students, and equally fond of the chocolate chip cookies that they make at Longboat, where he gets them for free after outings!

 I recommend wholeheartedly, and worth every penny.

Also, a close personal friend of Johnny Tarantini, who drives Italian bumper cars around Sarasota, but is one of the top golfers in the American South.  ALSO fond of Longboat's cookies.............",1465084800,,901,4.7973856209150325
8509666,3,B00749YM40,"The video is ok.  I bought it trying to lower my strokes a few.  Some of the tips were useful but for the most part, it really did not help me to improve my game that much.",1435968000,,172,3.6216216216216215
8509667,5,B00749YM40,"Borgatti's approach and exercises boil things down to essentials and keys that have answered my biggest questions and clued me into the essential movements that for the first time have enabled me to feel the swing as a unified whole ..the proverbial one piece movement ...that I have been looking for for so long. I highly recommend this for anyone at any level who wants to keep it simple and get it right (and keep their back healthy in the process). Thank You Roberto!

8509668,4,B00749YM40,easy to follow and very informative. I definitely benefited by practicing the suggested routines.,1420848000,,97,6.0
8509669,4,B00749YM40,"Gives a really good review of the overall swing.  I think the real strength of these videos is his coverage of short-game techniques.  His tips on chipping, pitching, and putting have made a HUGE difference in my game.  Would recommend to a friend because the coverage is so comprehensive that different people might benefit from other parts of the DVDs",1413244800,4,353,4.85
8509670,5,B00749YM40,"This DVD integrates essential concepts that a golfer at any level will appreciate along with great visual content to make it easy to practice and perfect the tips that Roberto demonstrates.

Its fantastic for beginners, and an excellent resource for refining the game of more skilled players.  The training segments and presentation are outstanding.

Excellent for anyone looking to improve their game, and makes a great gift!",1390176000,,426,5.3283582089552235
8509671,4,B00749YM40,It's a good book....some valuable nuggets inside. I wish I had the book to go along with the dvd It would help.,1373673600,,111,4.090909090909091
8509672,5,B00749YM40,I have both the book and video and they have renewed my excitment for golf. Roberto Borgatti has a unique talent for making a somewhat complicated topic (golf) easy to understand. His inovative teaching ideas have helped me to address long standing swing plane problems and overcome a host of weak set up postions. This instructor has a bright future and I hope he continues to write and teach so I can continue to learn and improve.,1368144000,2,433,4.636363636363637
8509673,5,B00749YM40,"This is a must for the golfer in your family. Whether they are a beginner or expert, you can learn so much from Roberto. With Christmas near, it's a must for the golfer in your life!!!",1355788800,,184,4.138888888888889
8509674,5,B00749YM40,"The book and video are superb.  Using them together is as good as getting a personal golf training session or 5.  I've watched and read a ton of really good golf instruction videos and books.  I do believe this to be my favorite.

He addresses and recognizes many important aspects of the golf swing and setup.  The fact that he acknowledges that ball position, and some key factors really depend on how you are built is rarely recognized in the golf instruction world.  He gives options and clearly explains that you need to find your niche, your swing while giving concrete advice on how to find it.

I look for my scores to drop immensely.  The instruction also dives into 5 key areas of the golf game.  Very comprehensive, very thorough.  A+++",1345680000,,747,4.590909090909091
