8294013,3,B001DL9DXU,"Some of the cast members are cute, but the script and editing are so cheesy that it's nearly unwatchable.  It seems like they didn't shoot enough footage, because they replay some of it multiple times, and it seems like they use a lot of stock footage for transitions.  Felicia Day shows up briefly, but she gets less than 10 minutes of screen time.",1513209600,,349,4.523809523809524
8294014,4,B001DL9DXU,"I liked it, very good comedy, keeps you laughing.",1437609600,,49,4.555555555555555
8294015,3,B001DL9DXU,"This film is a nice piece of fluff. It's a romantic comedy and if that is all you expect of it, it is just fine for a Saturday night movie date. For me, as usual, having Felicia Day in the cast is worth at least one star because she is so talented. The lead actress was good in a workaday manner...nothing exceptional. If you enjoy this kind of film and can get it for a good price, go ahead...it's not too bad.",1387411200,,411,4.024390243902439

it is a very funny movie. Enjoyed watching it.",1318464000,,112,4.380952380952381
8294017,5,B001DL9DXU,A really sweet romatntic comedy that captures the current Internet trend of blogging in which the lead female gets caught up in using blogging as a therapy. Very nice entertainment and certainly very current.,1231977600,2,208,5.147058823529412
8294018,5,B001DL9DXU,"I've never seen a movie before about blogging. Some Tropic Thunder type humor mixed into a romantic comedy about the dangers of sharing your intimate thoughts for all the world to see. The male lead is gorgeous, Patrick Dempsey dreamy but better looking. Deluise has his father's [Dom] great comedic talent. The musical score alone is worth it.",1229040000,2,344,4.948275862068965
8294019,4,B001DL9DXU,"This is a very funny guy humor movie set in a girl's movie world - perfect for date night or whatever.  With all the blog-addicts out there, I'm surprised no one's made a movie about it before.  There's a great scene with David DeLuise that I couldn't stop laughing at - this guy should have his own sitcom.  I bought a copy for my 14 year old daughter because it also has a good moral lesson about blogging.  She watched it with her friends at a slumber party.  She now thinks twice before she blogs.  If a movie can get through to a teenager, it's worth a watch.",1226448000,3,564,4.175925925925926
8294020,5,B001DL9DXU,Saw the film before it even had distribution & glad some smart distributor picked it up!  Had to own the dvd.,1222041600,2,109,4.190476190476191
