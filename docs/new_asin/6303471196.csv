7848645,5,6303471196,"A classic version young children and older ones will love. Starts with Beatrice Potter painting at her easel amidst an array of woodland creatures and country scenery. Caught in a sudden rain, she rushes home past Jemima Puddle-Duck and is greeted by her pet rabbit--Peter. She sits down with a cup of tea and writes a story-letter to a sick boy. Animation begins here with the 2 Peter Rabbit tales. British accents, a haunting song--Perfect Day-- and school children returning home singing after the rain. Great imagery. My grandchildren grew up watching this.",1446076800,,561,5.043010752688172

7848647,5,6303471196,"Peter Rabbit, and his three sisters, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail are seen off by their mother to go pick blueberries, for their mother's kitchen, but Peter Rabbit has other ideas.
He decides to sneak into Mr. McGregor's garden, where he soon finds himself fleeing for his life.
He does not want to end up like his father, who was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.
This video brings to life the world of Beatrix Potter.
The artist of the animations must certainly have studied the movements and way of rabbits to capture them so perfectly, and what was also captured beautifully was the English countryside in a better, simpler time.
The music is also wonderful, particularly the last two songs.
The Foxy Gentleman Song is marvelous, and the animations during the song, fit it perfectly.",1068595200,5,785,4.779411764705882
