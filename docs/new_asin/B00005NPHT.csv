8244885,5,B00005NPHT,"If you are a beginner in watercolor, like I am, and looking for a clear and useful watercolor video, than may I suggest this video. I wish I had known about Ellen Fountain's series first because I would have saved myself a lot of money and frustration on the many other videos and books for beginners that I have purchased.
Ellen is really an excellent teacher, she begins the video with what I believe is a very important lesson - building confidence!  I think this is  essential when you are just starting out, especially with watercolor, which is very challenging. She explains everything, even the little details - like why you catch the bead of paint on a graded wash.  Now I  know why, and I remember to catch that bead.  If you mess up, she shows you how to work with it - so you can go on - and not give up from frustration.
Painting should be a fun and rewarding pastime and Ellen's video has certainly made watercolor more pleasurable and fulfilling for me.  I really learned a great deal and I highly recommend it!",998179200,13,1025,4.425531914893617
