They don't play out well at all. Not funny at all either. Also, this is the first police academy movie to be rated PG. The remaining movies in the series would also get a PG rating (the first 2 movies were rated R). A real dissapointment this one compared to the first 2 films. 2 stars",1422921600,,452,4.206896551724138

1193853,4,B000006G1Y,"This is more or less a rehashing of the first film only the Police Academy gang are now the instructors rather than the cadets.  The governor is gonna close down one of the city's two police academies, and an evaluation of their performances will determine which one it will be.  Lassard calls in his old pals to teach the new recruits which include Sweetchuck and his nemesis, Zed, Tackleberry's brother in law(the kid who's always fist fighting with his dad), Fackler's wife, and Nogata(played by Brian Tochi), who is a walking embodiment of Asian stereotypes.  There's also a new love interest for Mahoney, but she's a total throwaway.  Since we're back at the academy, Lassard has more screen time, and Callahan is back as well.  Also back are the two butt kissing bullies, Blanks and Copeland, who are now working as spies for the rival academy, and are trying to see that Lassard's academy fails.  Good old Lt. Mauser(now Commandant Mauser) returns, and is now in charge of the second academy(after proving to be such a screwup, how did this guy get to be in charge of a police academy?), and of course determined to win by his usual butt kissing tactics and acts of sabotage.  Naturally he's also on the receiving end once again of Mahoney's pranks(he gets his eyebrows ripped off).  Since Mauser is back, it can only mean that Proctor is right there along side of him.  Proctor has one of the best moments in the movie when he's locked out of his hotel room naked(a Mahoney prank carried out by the same prostitute from the podium scene in the first film), and stumbles his way out of the hotel directly into.......The Blue Oyster Bar!!!
Even though it recycles a lot of the jokes from the first movie, I thought this one was much better and funnier than the previous movie.  Good times.",1208476800,,1795,4.651898734177215
1193894,2,B000006G1Y,"Police Academy 3 - Back in Training~ Steve Guttenberg is a mediocre sequel in the seemingly endless Police Academy series. The acting is not nearly on the same level as in the first movie (except for Bob Goldthwait whom is awesome) and the script is a real bottom feeder and to think they made another 4 movies. Just that makes my head ache big time. All the jokes that were in the movie, the musical mouth is in this movie as well and that is not a good thing. Like we once more get to see the inside of the classic blue oyster bar. The movie is filled with steerotypical charchters, the japanse exchange officer whom speaks horrible  ""Enrish"" and is good at karate, the violent italian american and many others that florished in the movies during the 80's. I am not a fan of pc but this is almost crossing the line of like good taste. Recommended if you are a huge fan of the police academy series otherwise avoid this mediocre movie. It is not a real ""stinker"" but I can still not give it more then 2 out of 5 stars.",1149552000,,1019,4.252577319587629

1193897,2,B000006G1Y,"You think that the cast of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" had a tough time shooting the trilogy almost 2 years? Think again, because for some mysterious reason, the childish ""Police Academy"" series released a movie year after year, from 1984 to 1989, that's right, one of this stinking turkeys every year. Well, to be honest, I loved this movies...when I was 8 years old, but time flies fast, and things change.

""Police Academy 3: Back In Training"" is a collection of racial stereotypes, cliched characters, unfunny jokes, one dimensional performances and bad direction. Most of the actors could only get a job in the ""Police Academy"" series, and that is mostly their fault, because if they had chosen different roles, they could still be acting today in movies...I guess.

Perhaps I'm being unfair, ""Police Academy 3: Back In Training"" is not that bad...to see only once. ""Police Academy 3: Back In Training"" is not that bad...if you are a kid. ""Police Academy 3: Back In Training"" is not that bad...if you think Adam Sandler is a funny guy.",1092268800,,1036,4.782122905027933
1193898,4,B000006G1Y,"A film by Jerry Paris
If you have seen any of the ""Police Academy"" movies, you know exactly what you are going to get with ""Police Academy 3: Back in Training"".  This is a screwball comedy dealing with the police force and a police academy.  All of the major protagonists are very likable characters, however, and this has been the charm of the series (at least for those who think the series has charm).  It is fun to follow the antics and hijinks of the squad of new recruits as they grow into police officers who always save the day no matter how ridiculous things gets.  And no, that is not giving away the ending of any ""Police Academy"" movie.
Having graduated from the Academy in the first movie and being given their first assignment in the second movie, Commadant Lassard's (George Gaynes) favorite recruits are called back to help Lassard save his beloved Academy.  The city is threatening to close one of its two police academies and there will be an evaluation team deciding which academy will remain open and which will close its doors for good.  The competition is between Lassard's Academy and that of Lieutenant Mauser (Art Mertrano).  Mauser will stop at nothing to keep his academy open.  Lassard calls back his favorite recruits: Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Tackleberry (David Graf), Hightower (Bubba Smith), Jones (Michael Winslow) and the soft voiced Hooks (Marion Ramsey).  They join Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), a favorite instructor from the first film.  Together, they mess things up in the attempt to look good for the evaluation team, but they are earnest enough that they can't help but win you over (all the while you are laughing).
When if first saw this movie ten to fifteen years ago, I loved it (and all the other ""Police Academy"" movies).  Having grown up a bit, I understand that they aren't particularly great movies, but I still found ""Police Academy 3"" to be a lot of fun to watch.  It remains funny, and charming, and reminds me of when I first watched the movie.  It is a bit of nostalgia for me.  The only downside to this movie: the return of Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait), the former gang leader from the second movie who is now a cadet at Lassard's academy.  Naturally.  Zed aside, fun movie.

1193899,4,B000006G1Y,"March 1986 saw the theatrical release of this film. The Metropolitan Police Academy Class of 1984 are ""back in training"" due to the possibility of one of two academies becoming defunct. A hired committee evaluates and compares the two academies,Commandant Eric Lassard's(George Gaynes) and Lieutant Mauser's(Art Metrano). Mauser hires Kyle Blankes and Chad Copeland,who both return after appearing in the first film,to rig Lassard's academy(Mauser wants to keep his and kill Lassard's). The devious duo come up with various tasks for Lassard's academy members. Much of the previous cast members appear in this film. Bobcat Goldthwait and Tim Kazurisnky return in this film,now members of the Metropolitan Police Academy. Now joining is Doug Fackler's wife,who two years ago,dissuaded Doug from joining! Doug's philosophy is ""a woman's place is in the home"". Also there's newcomer Karen Adams,a blonde beauty who also joins and whom Carey Mahoney(Steve Guttenberg) becomes attracted to. The villains in this film are terrorists at an outdoor luncheon. So the MPA members go undercover in wetsuits bringing the terrorists to justice. Mauser's academy becomes defunct which means Art Metrano would not return for the following sequels. Memorable scenes include Mauser losing his eyebrows via duct tape. This happened when at a pub,Carey blindfolds Mauser with the tape. Carey revolves a glass of beer,and champagne in another glass,same shape and size. Mauser plays the guessing game and wins. Proctor(Lance Kinsey) rapidly removes the tape,thus removing Mauser's eyebrow hairs. So Mauser gets a fake pair. Well,that was a much smaller mess of hair than what happened in PA2. The hooker,seen in the first film,also returns in this one. She does a favor for Proctor. Another funny scene,is where after a romantic escapade between the two,the hooker sweetly and gradually evicts Proctor from her hotel suite while he's still naked. He receives stares from shocked passersby! Also returning is Leslie Easterbrook as Lt. Callahan.",1084924800,,2023,5.466453674121405
1193900,5,B000006G1Y,"This time the city has decided to shutdown of their police academies, so know it's between Lassard and Mauser's academies to compete to see which academy is the best and can stay open. Mahoney, Hightower, Jones, Tackelberry,etc are training new recruits including Sweet Chuck, and Zed(the gangleader in P.A. 2). There are many great gags, as one would come to expect, Mauser loses his eyebrows this time. There's a great Blue Oyster bar scene with Proctor. If you liked the first two you should enjoy this one, however it is tamer than the prievious Police Academy films, this would be one for the whole family to enjoy.",1071187200,,620,4.803738317757009
