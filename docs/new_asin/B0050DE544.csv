8451068,4,B0050DE544,"Like most wrestling cards there are things I liked and other things not so much. I bought this because of the main event, Nikki Roxx and Amber Oneal vs Angel Orsini and Jazz which was excellent. I love watching those ladies knock the ""spit"" out of each other. Without spoiling anything I can say that someone eats a ""Barbie Crusher"" and its awesome. I also love Rain and Lacey. The production values are kinda uneven, The commentary is always clear but the in ring soliloquies sometimes cannot be understood, especially Rain (which is not her fault, IMO). But Rain is so good at gesture and expression that I did not care what she actually said, I got the message. I fast forwarded thru Mickie Knuckles and Amy Lee fake punching each other and no selling. I don't care if I ever see those 2 again, I find them unengaging as performers. Also, the elimination tag was predictable in the extremus and practically a GIP match. I gave it 4 stars because there is plenty to like here and fast forward makes the rest tolerable.",1409270400,,1020,4.548913043478261
