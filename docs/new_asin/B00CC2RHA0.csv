8580124,3,B00CC2RHA0,Theyre ok. Very zen but can learn something. Every sport has an internal side. This was more of a spiritual lesson to me along with the books. Some things spoken of are hard to believe......but hey horse people think they can talk to horses.,1512864000,,241,4.5

8580129,5,B00CC2RHA0,"I have ridden with Sally and went to a few clinics with her. That was a long time ago. It is
nice to see her in these videos. Her direction of riding is the basis of many that have
come and gone after her. You can do all the ideas and teachings right in your living
room, with the video on. You don't need a horse or a saddle.
Story: I was taking lessons in Hunter/Jumper, and at the same time, I was taking
lessons in dressage at another barn.  I had gone up to VT to spend a week with Sally,
and I didn't tell my Jumping teacher that I went. When I got up on my horse, and
took a spin around the arena, her mouth hung open in stun. She was absolutely
totally speechless. That was how good Sally's lessons were. They totally changed
my riding. Yes, the true label is Centered Riding. I got on my saddle and my life
had changed, for the better. Amazing.",1424131200,11,853,4.017647058823529
