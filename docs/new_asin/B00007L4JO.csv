7978001,5,B00007L4JO,"This language course is commendable because of it's concise, clear and entertaining approach to French grammar.  Yes, there are other television courses such as ""French In Action"" from the Annenberg Foundation (of which I am a big fan) and ""Allez France"" from the BBC (or maybe it was ITV but whatever) which are more conversational but if you want an easy listening (and learning) primer, this is the way to go by far. It packs a lot of grammar into a small time period but because it is not overcomplicated, you retain what you hear more quickly and completely than traditional lessons (or programs) I find. Less is often better in my opinion, even for someone at a moderately advanced level such as myself. Because I have been learning and speaking French for many years, I have a good vocabulary and can converse easily but because I am largely self-taught, this kind of thing is what I need.",1255651200,2,896,4.670886075949367
7978002,1,B00007L4JO,"this is not my favorite product for French classes. it might be better for 8 y.o., not older. too many jumping images, repeats and has a feel of being in class. definitelly not enough of practice.",1210032000,,196,4.472222222222222
