4068920,4,B0034KQ5JI,"being erica is a show about a woman who is disappointed with where her life has ended up and as a result ends up seeing this therapist who sends her back in time to reconcile herself with regrets she has about her past. i thought the concept for the show was pretty interesting and i thought that the events of the past she went back to reconcile were relatively universal landmarks that are relatable to the audience. she gets sent back to situations like her bat mitzfah, her first sexual experience, the university group that could have landed her her dream job, event that went both well and not so well with friends and family, and in one episode she was even sent back to before her birth to better understand her parents.

one of the things i liked about this series was that at no point in any of the times erica goes back in time is she able to alter the chain of events that have happened. she has a list of regrets that the therapist, tom, sends her back to and she may change her perspective or may do something different from what she did in the past, but the resulting action that happened originally will still happen. the only difference is that she understands the situation for what it is and comes to realize that she is not to blame, or if she is, to own up to her faults and change her perspective or current actions to make things right. so really, even though this sounds sort of like a science fiction with all the time travel, it is more of erica's rumination of her life and the actions she takes to own her life and make it what she wants it to be.

i thought that the characters were interesting and sufficient attention was paid to each of the minor characters. everyone in the show is given a story (minus erica's boss, who is discussed more in the second season) and everyone is given a little bit of depth. we learn about erica more and more with each episode as we see her struggle with her past, so needless to say that erica grows as a character and who we see at the beginning of the series is somewhat altered from the person who we see at the end. an interesting show to say the least.",1268265600,4,2123,4.278606965174129
4068921,5,B0034KQ5JI,Come on production people - get this show available now to North Americans. It is a great show (heading into season 2)with timely messages and with some humor too.,1260057600,9,163,4.655172413793103
4068922,3,B0034KQ5JI,"First off, the SHOW is AWESOME! It's great! I happened to see previews for it before the first season came out and I ended up watching it faithfully. If you have not seen it - it's a must see - somehow! Season 2 is in the making. Second, I'm not understanding WHY the first season is not offered in the United States on DVD??? - the show is on DirecTV (and cable). This doesn't make sense! H E L L O people we're not back in the 60s or 70s - let's get with it and put the show on DVD for ALL TO BUY! THANK YOU! I hope ""Being Erica"" fans agree! This is ridiculous!",1257811200,13,563,3.8620689655172415
4068923,5,B0034KQ5JI,"We really love this series. It is about a 30 something girl (Erin Karpluk) who feels she isn't where she hoped to be by this age and her friends have passed her by. She has many regrets and thinks life could have worked out differently if she hadn't made a series of bad decisions. She does however have good friends including a separated male friend (Tyron Leitso), and an interesting Jewish family. Into her life walks a therapist- sort-of. He is of no fixed address in that his office can just turn up at any time when she is going about her business- or he will appear in the street dressed as some other profession. Is he an angel or a wise aspect of herself???
Whatever he is, he has the power to throw her back into the pivotal regret points in her life so she can relive them and make other choices. While this doesn't necessarily change her history she grows and makes different choices no based on what she learns. This isn't all fairy floss either as her changed decisions may cause friction now rather than happy endings. Therapist also is a great quoter of wise sayings. In short this makes you think and is brimming with wisdom served in an easily digested package with some nice people to hang out with.
We hope they keep making this series for years. This is season 1 but season 2 is now being made. We cant wait. btw I don't think it's even been shown on Australian TV where I am and we were lucky to stumble across it on DVD. Give it a shot.",1250294400,22,1459,4.3090909090909095
4068927,5,B0034KQ5JI,"Erica is the kind of character that epitomizes the human struggle to live and be authentic in the face of what/who we are told we should be/do.

I've literally had dreams similar to Erica's revisiting of her past, and my improved self-reflection, thanks to this show, has helped me understand elements of my childhood/teen years through adult eyes.  Truly special, and truly life-changing.  Erin Karpluk is a sensation.

If US tv had gotten a hold of it, they would have messed it up *somehow. I saw Erin Karpluk in Christmas Lodge here on Amazon Prime, and really enjoyed her natural and true-to-life acting skills (she held that movie together!).

I'm watching this with my daughter who is around erica's age and her name is erica.  That's why I got it.  I had no idea what it was about.  We love it.  It's our little thing we watch together.  We are on the 2nd season and enjoy every episode.

The characters are believable and there are some funny things that my daughter can really relate to at the age she is.

I'm surprised I never heard of it before I did a blanket search for ""erica"" and found this series.  Would love to see it resurrected.",1361232000,,695,4.2615384615384615
4068983,5,B0034KQ5JI,"Well done.  This entertaining show has several unexpected twists and turns.  I watched all four seasons and wished they would come out with another one.

4068984,4,B0034KQ5JI,"Erica is just a normal girl living in Toronto who is trying to get her life started - just like you and me.  But unlike you and me, she has some ""special"" help from Dr. Tom, who can somehow send her back in time to points of her life where things could use a little ""improving.""  But sometimes, things don't always go as we thought they would go, and we learn through Erica to ""be careful what we wish for, because we just might get it.""

Never too serious, but often touching, this series went on for four seasons, exploring in a variety of ways what might happen if you had a chance to do it over again.  And Dr. Tom is full of wise advice and fortune cookie maxims that help Erica - and us - learn the deeper lessons of our everyday choices.

The star of the show, Erin Karpluk, is wonderful, pretty and smart and oh so earnest, and as an actor she gets to play her character in all ages and all stages of development, including a gawky teenager, sensitive college poet, job applicant just falling short of getting the job, and so on.  Fortunately, when things look rough, she steps through a door and finds herself back with Dr. Tom, in time for another session.

This show is imaginative, intellegent, and heartfelt.  You'll enjoy meeting her family and friends and coworkers again and again in different time periods.  And after a few episodes, you'll never walk through a doorway the same way again.  Enjoy.",1353801600,,1414,4.424710424710424
4068985,5,B0034KQ5JI,"This show is amazing. It's intelligent, funny, deep, and well-acted. I only heard about it through a friend.

I don't know if the seller knew this before, but the second disc of the first season is wrong, it really contains the chapters included in the second disc of the second season. At least in the boxset I received, but I think it is the same case for all the first season series, because the disc is printed with the first season graphics.

If you are planning to buy this first season series, don't do it, they are very expensive for a poor presentation and this kind of manufacture errors.

I also bought the second season, it has no errors.

By the way, I contacted Netdealz (the seller) and they offered me to return it. I ended up downloading the chapters from a blog (with Portuguese subtitles). It would be more expensive to return it from Mexico. As a suggestion, Amazon should offer you download them for free.",1319500800,,979,5.256410256410256
4068998,4,B0034KQ5JI,"SWF early 30's and looking for her place in the world and the meaning of life.  This has been done before from ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" to ""Caroline in The City"" to ""The New Adventures of Old Christine.""  So what makes this work?  Is it the Therapist/Angel/? constant use of quotations?  Is it the kicking soundtrack that is in sync to the time period?  Is it that most people can relate to moments in our past where the proverbial left turn in lieu of going right might have changed things?  Perhaps most important, is it my constant internal debate as to whether I find Erica ""hot or not"" =:)

My hypothesis would be that it is the sum of parts that makes this show work.  I have Season 2 and look forward to watching Season 3.  It is also a great move by the CBC to announce a Season 4 and that will conclude the series.  My hope is that with some fine programming emanating from Canada that the CBC has learned from the error of their ways a la Intelligence and The Border.",1315785600,,980,4.248648648648649
4068999,5,B0034KQ5JI,"Erica is almost finished with her therapy with Dr Tom. Dr Tom wants to talk about Erica's greatest regret, her brother Leo. Leo died in a tragic accident and Erica wants to prevent his death. Dr Tom tells Erica that she can't change someone's destiny; only her own. Erica lied to him. Erica saves Leo and Dr Tom gets angry. He told her that there's dire consequences for changing someone's destiny. Out of rage, Dr Tom throws Erica out of his office so she can see her consequence. Erica's world has changed. Nothing in Erica's world is the same but Leo lives to become an adult but he dies anyway. Erica learns the hard way that she can't cheat Leo's death so she pleaded with Dr Tom to go back to the original death. Dr Tom grants Erica her wish and decides that he doesn't want to work with Erica anymore. He leaves her.

This is a great final finale for Being Erica. I was very touched by Erica's desperate desire to cheat Leo's death. She loves him so very much that she was willing to ruin her relationship with Dr Tom. I also love the scene where Erica tries to fix her mistake by letting Leo die as he did originally but have Leo write a letter about himself so Erica can show it to her family in the future. Very touching episode for season one. I'm looking forward to watch season two.",1310774400,2,1295,4.307377049180328

He likes Erica and invites her to a Goth party where they play a role playing game of vampires. Erica is scared of ""If"" and runs away. When Dr Tom forces her to relive her past she decides not to run away. By not running away and playing ""If's"" vampire game, Erica starts to enjoy her new experience. Erica learns that nothing ventured is nothing gained. She has more self-confidence about herself.

I love this episode. It seems that the episodes get better and better towards the end of the season. I love Erin Karpluk's improvisational acting when she dressed up as a lady vampire. Karpluk played her character as Erica during a bar scene and then jumps into a vampire character complete with a witch-like accent and body jestures. Karpluk is a good actor. It's no wonder why the producer and director hired her for this job.",1310688000,,1245,4.484581497797357

She's determined to make her lucky break work at all costs. She becomes obsessed in controling everything and everyone. She pushes away all of her friends including Ethan, her potential boyfriend, to a point where they all hate her. Dr Tom intervines. He takes Erica out of the bad situation and asks her to relax. Then he asks her what does she want to do with her potential boyfriend, Ethan. Erica intially wants no romantic relationship with Ethan and then she changes her mind and says she does. So Dr Tom take Erica to two points in her life to change her relationship with Ethan; both failed. Then Erica understands that her greatest challenge in her life is to understand that she can't change people's behaviors or control them. She can only control her own life and destiny.

This is the best episode I like so far because many viewers can relate to Erica's obsession to control everything. I think many viewers can relate to Erica's wishes to make life exactly the way they want it but can't. I was cheering for Erica when she finally told Ethan how much she hated him for not paying attention to her needs. I love Michael Riley's performance as Dr Tom in this episode.",1310601600,,1299,4.599137931034483

Erica can't figure out why and it's destroying her life. Dr Tom takes her back to a Halloween party in high school where she finally understands Katie's resentment towards her. Katie felt belittled by Erica's presence. Since she was popular back in high school, Katie felt unloved by Erica so she hated her for the rest of her life. After understanding this, Erica tries to make amends to Katie.

She says she's hetrosexual and wants to marry a man but her best friend, Cassidy, is challenging her beliefs because she's gay. Cassidy and Erica are very close friends. They enjoy each other's company. Their friendship is so strong that Cassidy starts to make suggestions that she wants more than just a close friendship. Erica turns her away and she never sees her again. Years has passed and she regrets what she's done. She still loves her just as a friend and she wanted to change her past and keep the friendship. Dr Tom grants Erica her wish but it didn't turn out what she planned. Instead, she starts to experiement in a gay relationship that ended in a valuable lesson for Erica. She learned that in any lasting relationship, you and your significant other must commit to each other 100%.

This is a controversal episode. Intoducing a gay relationship challenges the viewer's beliefs about homosexuality. I applaud the screenwriter's and director's courage to make this episode. I also applaud Erin Karpluk, and Anna Silk for their courage to play their characters as gay because they can be stereotyped and they might not get other jobs as actors in the future.",1310342400,4,1238,4.895238095238096

Yom Kippur is an important holiday for Erica and her family. They set aside their differences to be together. But the feud between each other quickly turns a family reunion into a disaster. In order to help Erica understand her disfunctional family, Dr Tom takes her back to her parent's past, not hers. He takes her back to the early 1970's before Erica was born and Erica starts to understand why they fell in love.

This is another cool episode I like. I like the scene where Erica turns into a Hippy and meets her parents before they got married. The stage set looks very convincing of a 1970's Hippy party. The best part of this episode is the dialog she had between her mother and her father where she finds out that they fell in love for reasons that she can't fully understand.",1310256000,,940,4.562130177514793

Erica misses her brother, Leo, very much and the last time she was with Leo was when he was at an amusement park along with her sister. This was the last time she saw Leo before he died. She learned that you can't relive the same experience twice. Each time you relive it, it changes a little.

I find this episode ok. I like the scene where Leo has a crush with an older girl and seduces her. I also like the scene where Erica apologizes to her sister at a fountain and splashes water at her.",1310169600,,635,4.0

She never told her sister about this until the last minute during the marriage ceremony. Dr Tom takes Erica back in time where she had the opportunity to stop the relationship before it got started. She finds out that love is complicated and some people fall in love for reasons that's beyond logic.

This episode is alright. It had some cool moments where her sister disowns Erica for telling her what she really feels during her marriage. Overall, I like it.",1310169600,,614,4.531531531531532
4069007,5,B0034KQ5JI,"There's a part of Erica that is naive. She sometimes doesn't confront her problems as an adult and she sees life from a child's perspective that isn't neccessary healthy. When her best friend was pregnant, she thought she was going to be the godmother. But because of her naive attitude, her best friend decided to choose someone else because she saw her as the ""Wacky Aunt."" This devastated her. Dr Tom takes her back to a point in her life where this all began, her Bat Mitzvah.

Erica is Jewish. In the religion every girl who reaches age 12 or 13 goes through a rite of passage called the Bat Mitzvah. It's basically a ritual where girls goes through a ceremony to become responsible adults. This was a huge event for Erica. She had high expectations that it was going to be wonderfull. Her mother and father paid a lot of money to make her rite of passage the best they can afford. Erica's Bat Mitzvah didn't go as smoothly as she planned. There was a bully boy who teased her celebration and called her a loser. Erica, feeling hurt, ran away from her important part of her life that forever changed her.

Erica has a second chance on life. Dr Tom brings her back to her Bat Mitzvah and she is age 13 again. This time she didn't run away from her problems. Instead of making her Bat Mitzvah bigger than it really was, she enjoyed it for what it is. She learned that being an adult is to understand who you are and having the courage to be who you are.

Being Erica is a progressive Soap Opera. The screenwriters, producers, and directors chose Judaism as Erica's religion. This is a Canadian Soap Opera so I don't know about Canadian's attitudes about watching TV with a Jew as the main charactor but for me this is really pushing accepted norms and I love it. In addition, they introduced a gay couple that is portrayed as realistically as possible; not the stereotype that is seen on TV. I'm not Jewish or Gay. I love this episode because it's so progressive.",1310169600,,1966,4.4404432132963985

Erica always wanted to impress people of authority but she can't impress her poetry class teacher Professor Lozar. Professor Lozar is a narcistic bully. He shouts at her and tells her that she's useless in his poetry class. Erica initally gives in to his imtimidations but she finally stands up to him in the end.

I like this episode. I like the scene where Erica is totally imtimided by Professor Lozar in his poetry class where she just freezes and gives this look of hurt on her face. I also like Erica's friend, Ethan, reading his poetry out to class with his gangster rap lingo. I like best of all is actor Damir Andrei who played Professor Lozar. He played his character as the typical ""crazy professor"" with his uncombed hair and his thick European accent.",1309651200,,1035,4.564516129032258

He used her to have sex and even humiliated her by video taping her having sex like a porn star. Erica was determined to have her revenge on that boy and learns something about herself in the process.

This episode had some cute monments. I was amused when Erica goes back in time and relives her teenage party with all of the music and all the silly talk teenagers would say to each other. I really love the scene where she gets her revenge from that guy that used her for sex. What is really cool is she falls in love with a nerd and has sex with him instead during the party.",1309478400,,871,4.063953488372093
4069010,5,B0034KQ5JI,"In this episode Erica finds herself choosing between ""just making it by in life"" or listening to herself and her dreams. Erica doesn't make a lot of money so she's desperate to find a job. Her uncle has a job opening at his wedding shop so he offers her a position but this positoin is a dead-end job. Erica tries this job because she feels preasured by her family but Dr Tom intervenes. Dr Tom takes her back to her college days where she had to choose a simular situation between joining a snubish club or not.  In the end Erica learns that she's never wrong when it comes to listening to her heart.

This is a nice episode where Erica has to choose between what she wants or what people want out of her. I like the club initiation scene where she is told to burry someone alive. I also like the scene where she back-stabs her friend to gain popularity in the club but regrets what she's done latter on. Erin Karpluk's performance as Erica is convincing. I totally understood the character's confusion between choosing what's right or wrong in her life.",1309046400,,1055,4.43298969072165
4069011,5,B0034KQ5JI,"I'm not much of a soap opera fan but Being Erica peaked my interests. The whole entire show is based on an idea that you can relive your past and fix any mistakes in your life. At least that's what Erica Strange thinks. This is a weird psychotherapy stories where Erica can relive her past so she can be happier.

In this first episode, you get to meet Erica Strange, she is a beautiful young 32 year old woman who has low self-esteeem. She thinks she's a loser because she's not married and has no kids.  She doesn't even have a boyfriend and she works at dead end jobs that she can't hold for long. To Erica, she believes she's doomed to be a miserable spinster. Then she meets her psychotherapist, Dr Tom.

Dr Tom is no ordinary therapist. He has magical powers to go back in time. After talking to Erica and having her write a list of her ""mistakes"" in life, he takes her to her high school prom. Erica is suddenly a teenager again and is determined to change history and make her life better by not doing what she believes was a mistake in her life.

I had my doubts about liking this soap opera because I'm not a soap opera person but Erin Karpluk who plays Erica is a good actor. Karpluk really sells Erica as this confused, beautifull woman, that can't see herself as a beautifull, loving, woman that has a lot to offer in her life. I felt really engaged in the character's plight and empathize with her struggles in life. If you are into drama, this show is a good one for you to watch.",1308614400,,1495,4.27208480565371

Seriously, this is funniest and most dramatic show, but it also has really cool life lessons that'll make your own life better and better.  Who knew personal development could be as easy as enjoying a great tv show.  Why aren't people like Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Depak Chopra, Brian Tracy, T. Harv Eker, Rhonda Byrne, Ekhardt Tolle, Oprah Winfrey and Dr Phil telling everyone to buy DVD of this show?  They should!",1304812800,,475,4.686746987951807

4069014,5,B0034KQ5JI,"I am surprised this isn't on blu-ray and even more surprised to see it isn't in stock and being sold by amazon.  Being Erica may end up being another series like Firefly that many will be left wondering why they never heard of it.  It is witty, fun, full of wisdom and has a touch of sci-fi to it.  One of the downfalls of Being Erica may be that each episode is not a stand alone story encapsulating a large theme but is instead a story that requires, for the most part, the viewers to have watched most episodes to appreciate current ones.  This doesn't hold true for every episode as long as you have seen some of what transpired in the past but is generally true.  I give this series a 5/5 stars and highly recommend it.",1293235200,,724,4.217391304347826

WHY isn't this show offered in the United States on a major network, or anywhere that is actually accessible to the masses?! And now to find that this DVD isn't even offered in the US? That's just cruel. Thankfully to the world of the Internet, I've been able not to miss a single episode of this show that I dub, the ""best show you're not allowed to watch in the United States.""

I'm not sure what compelled me to mouse over the decidedly soapy looking image, but I did.  When I read the description, it was the mention of time travel that piqued my interest, if just a little.  I watched the first episode, and I was hooked.  Not a show most dudes might admit to watching, but hey, good drama is good drama.  It's well-written, well-acted, and very entertaining.  I can't wait for season 3 to find out more about what it's like to Be Erica.",1275177600,7,620,4.442477876106195

It starts off perfectly innocent, but each episode just keeps getting worse and worse. Nothing is sacred. Lies are told, drugs are taken, religion is mocked, theres sodomy, and the worst part is its supposed to be a show about a woman who is supposed to be fixing her life! Nothing is fixed! It just keeps getting worse and worse. Save yourself some time, money, self-respect, and PASS.",1527206400,,507,4.521739130434782

My only wish is that they didn't quit at season 4 (even though it makes sense) and that they would have followed Erica through to the new chapter of her life.

I also couldn't help thinking of Doctor Who though, just the time traveling doctor thing BUT that is really where the similarities end, of course. Also, loved the cameos from my girl in Lost Girl, and the girl from Orphan Black. (OF COURSE, this came out first so not really cameos but their first minor roles).

This show is sweet, sometimes too saccharin, sentimental, and engaging. The show's concept of going back in time to fix one's mistakes has a few new twists and turns although the outcomes are predictable.
