8390535,4,B0037FFA8C,"The movie which I streamed via Amazon Prime is listed at 55 minutes.  Both IMDb and TCM list it as an hour and fifteen minutes.  Apparently Amazon has the cut for television version of the movie.  Even with the cuts, this is a pretty good horse racing movie - the injured colt nursed to health by a kid and becoming a great racehorse with the kid as the jockey; the crooked gamblers trying to fix the races and plotting against the kid's older brother who is an honest jockey and of course the good guys (and girl) prevailing in the end.",1496275200,,537,4.297029702970297

8390537,4,B0037FFA8C,"This 1936 film stars Frankie Darro, Kane Richmond, Gladys Blake, Arthur Housman, and Jimmie Eagles.  In the story Frankie Reynolds (Darro) is a young jockey who brings back to health a crippled colt that he eventually enters into a horse race and wins.  His win puts him in the way of a gambling ring that pays off jockeys to throw races.  The gamblers do everything they can to keep Frankie and his horse from racing, but Frankie fights back with the help of his sister, Phyllis (Blake), and stable manager, Clay Harrison (Richmond).
Darro is outstanding in this film as he is in many others.  He, Richmond and Blake all work well together.  The print quality of this 55 minute film isn't terrific, but it's quite viewable and the audio is fine.  For Darro fans, it's definitely a nice film to have.",1272326400,,800,4.598591549295775

The film begins with a conversation about a horse race. Frankie wants to buy a young colt, he names him ""Trouble"". His sister Phyllis arrives. The colt grows into a horse. Frankie sees his friends to raise the money to put his horse in the race. [No Depression here?] The film shows how a gambler can fix a race by getting the jockeys to cooperate. People cheer for their horse as if this can help. Will they frame ""Smokey"" in revenge? Yes, he's banned for life. But will the big race be fixed? The guy who gave the $500 shows up at the diner; can they keep him there? There is humor here. Will a car chase provide action? [The clash of the gears dates the car.] ""Trouble"" maybe the equal to ""Dancing Boy"" in the Big Race.

Sam is suspicious of that car. [Nobody on guard before the big race? Not even a watch dog?] Did Sam put the wrong horse in the wrong stall? [How clever!] Will the bad guys make another attempt to fix the race? There is a kidnap. The police search all over but can't find Frankie. But a trick brings the police to rescue Frankie. [Its good to know Latin!] Can Frankie return in time to ride ""Trouble"" in the race? Will the police arrest Tex MacDonald and his gang? Will Frankie win a big purse for a happy ending? And you know what comes next.",1268352000,,1291,4.2439024390243905
