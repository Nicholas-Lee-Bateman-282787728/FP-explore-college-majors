8122563,5,B000FH9QMQ,"This film starts off typically slow. Yet slowly develops like an unknown disease. Gary is a very simple young man, with a simple job of condensing books. But how does one know what are the good parts to keep, and the bad parts to omit? Slowly, he starts looking at his own life after the sudden death of his father. And the fact the old mans legs were removed for 'medical donation', Gary develops this feeling of incompleteness and pending sickness. The more paranoid and sick Gary gets, the more strange reality gets around him. Looking for understanding and sympathy, Gary seems to get the worst end of the stick. No one really knows Gary, and what is happening to him. Just get through it, and get the job done. When the reality starts to become conclusively apparent, Gary collapses. He awakes in a hospital learning he needs a complete kidney transplant. And slowly family and workers start to know Gary a little better, and offer the sympathy required. But, what to do with the dark and dismal reality he was discovering just before his transplant...? A very ambiguous end that left me happy and sad for Gary and all those around him. One has to expect the worst, but truly hope for the best. A film deserving of high praise in the ranks of Polanski, Felleni, Gilliam, and Coen Bros. Oh Criterion, are you listening? Nudge, nudge. Wink, wink.... Unscrew that Region 0 garbage, and get this flick out to THE WORLD! Slick art house deserving of some decent respect!",1418169600,,1470,4.636015325670498

Hunk communicates with a boss in a toilet, with no interest to his assumingly girlfriend; one's wife spicks hunk's drinks, making her husband jealous to an extent of intruding into hunk's place, urinating it over and hitting him at a head for sex none had got during two hours of this silly, boring, mere time-spent-for-nothing movie.

What is good is demonstrating a typically stupid belief in expensive as the best and penalty for not following boss's private advice.

A film is only for very lovers of the Australian-made movies.",1227398400,,559,4.925531914893617
