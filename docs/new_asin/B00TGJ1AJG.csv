7008914,4,B00TGJ1AJG,"...as more of a sci-fi bend. Leaning towards Batman Beyond look to the film. Gotham City is like clean reminsent to Times Square. The animation is good and the plot is decent. The characters are extremely agile but then again in animated film, who isn't?  Hey, it's a family picture. The action is good. I like DC and a lot things DC. I'm entertained with this feature. I'm really looking forward to the special features. I'm waiting with bated breath for Justice League: Gods & Monsters. Though I've seen the preview, it's so reminiscent to the Bruce Timm's series. But the plot...the plot is an Elseworlds story!!! Wow!
Batman Unlimited is a nice addition to these animated films.",1431129600,,682,4.779661016949152
7008915,5,B00TGJ1AJG,"My 5 year old enjoyed it and i enjoyed watching it with her. A nice mix of characters, integrating different ""Batsuits"" and showing progression in characters that we already know. Can't wait for more.",1430956800,6,200,4.911764705882353
7008916,2,B00TGJ1AJG,Way to kiddy. The animation was different but the story was childish.,1430956800,4,69,4.833333333333333
7008917,2,B00TGJ1AJG,I'm a huge Batman fan but this movie is clearly targeted towards little kids. Just base your expectations off that before watching the movie. It's not a bad movie by any means. It's just not for me.,1430611200,9,198,4.378378378378378
7008918,3,B00TGJ1AJG,"I just watched this film...unfortunately. People should know that this is not like the recent DC comic movies that have been coming out. This is clearly made for children and probably also for the purpose of selling toys. The animation is poor and the story, characters and development are paper thin. I am very glad that I waited to watch a copy before I ordered this waste of money.",1430265600,21,384,4.579710144927536
7008919,3,B00TGJ1AJG,"Let's be honest. DC animation has lost its touch. Where there used to be classics like The Mask of the Phantasm, Under the Red Hood, and even Justice League: Flashpoint Paradox (in my opinion the last great DC animated movie), now we get trotted out overlong action scenes with token gestures at characterization and gravitas, or worse, obnoxious superheroes strutting around (looking at you, JL:War.)

Do DC animated movies need to be Pixar quality? No, but they should be better than this.

Batman Unlimited is the first in a series of original animated films that appears to be made for selling toys. Batman starts the movie in a red costume reminiscent of Batman Beyond (even the setting looks futuristic like Beyond), but he quickly changes back to his blue and greys. Why? Who knows. Soon after, Nightwing, Red Robin, Green Arrow, and Flash make an appearance, all battling different animal villains: Cheetah, Silverback, Killer Croc, Penguin, and Man-Bat.

Remember the later Batman: The Animated Series after the animation style changed and the writing progressively weakened? This movie feels like a really long episode of one of those. Very much for kids, at times extremely silly (the Flash will make you chuckle), not much semblance of plot, and little explanation of villain motives. Redbox it with your kids, but don't buy. No swearing, no nudity, no gratuitous violence. In the end it will leave you with no real impression of anything because it is a forgettable show.

Here's hoping that Gods and Monsters is a step back in the right direction, or that DC returns to making faithful adaptations of great DC comics. Heaven knows there's plenty of them: Sinestro Corps War, Death and Return of Superman (not that Superman: Doomsday crap), Final Crisis, Forever Evil, Blackest Night ... the list goes on. It seems that instead we get cancellations of quality stories: Young Justice (cliffhanger ending), Green Lantern The Animated Series (so much goodness in one season).

DC, you have some of the greatest comic stories of all time, USE THEM! Quit giving us mediocre stuff like this!",1429920000,12,2098,5.017241379310345
7008920,3,B00TGJ1AJG,"it's awesome how many batman movies DC has been making, every year more batman and justice league movies that's awesome!!!

however, this dvd when I first saw the cover I thought why is batman fighting animals? im not about to watch batman fighting animals or dinasours or whatever...then I saw the trailer on here and hmmmm... I still hate the animals fighting and everything, but penguin, looks like killer crock, gorilla grodd are all in this plus batman red robin nightwing flash and green arrow so that's a huge plus, I would literaly see nearly anything if nightwing or flash is in it..really hoping to give ths 5 star wen its out",1428278400,5,636,4.678571428571429

7008927,4,B00TGJ1AJG,"Overall Good Movie - This is directed at kids, but it's not dumbed down. It's only 77 minutes long, but it doesn't really seem like it when watching it and is made up for in the extras: a handful of DC Nation shorts and 2 episodes of Batman: Brave & the Bold. The shorts contain a cool episode featuring Batmongoose foiling the Croker's plans and some Japanese influenced animations of Batman vs. Catwoman & Bane (which are cool visually, but I don't really get the point - but that's just me) Also one with Plasticman and the story of how Eel O'Brian got away from the Batman. The 2 episodes of Brave & the Bold are mixed. I actually like the 2nd one better, Batman goes to the future to save the Flash from Professor Zoom. One of the more intelligent episodes from this series. The 1st episode has Batman injured and out of commission so his hero friends become Batman to look after Gotham in his absence to mixed results. I hope you don't mind that I mostly reviewed the Special Features, but everyone else did the movie - you can read those reviews for yourself.",1457395200,4,1066,4.416243654822335

I'm also a side-kick fan - so bonus points for including ""Red Robin.""  I know we've seen Tim Drake in animation before, but I think this is the first time he's in the Red Robin uniform.  Very cool.  Yes, it's a ""lighter"" film, but still good writing and lots of fun.  I'm looking forward to seeing ""Monster Mayham"" next.",1441843200,,484,4.454545454545454

7008953,1,B00TGJ1AJG,I have to say I thought this movie lacked a lot. First they made the flash into an idiot. In the scene in the bat cave there using science and the flash had a look of confusion on his face. The they tell him to sit down and let the grown ups talk. the first problem I have there is the flash was a scientist. So he would not only understand what there talking about but most likely be able to help better than Nightwing could. Second Depending on wich flash it was. He would have been older than Nightwing if it was Barry or Wally. The next problem I had was in the scene with Nightwing and Red robin in the cave of bats. Nightwing makes a comment that Red robin fears caves when isn't His hide out a cave? The problem there is he talks like he doesnt know. when Nightwing was batmans side kick before red robin. The next problem I had was the flying cop cars. they made it to Batman beyond and not classic batman. The finial problem I had was them putting green arrow into this and not have the real chemistry Green arrow and Batman had as fun rivalry. they acted more like partners. So in all I say the movie was a fail for the classic readers and a real work up for the show biz indistry to get 2 super heroes who got tv shows into a cartoon with batman just to make money.,1441411200,,1276,4.047430830039525

7008956,4,B00TGJ1AJG,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Batman Unlimited - Animal Instincts"" released by Warner Brothers.
Futuristic Gotham City is a bright and shiny place filled with anti-gravity police car and policemen who are hoping for just a glimpse of Batman as he carries on with his nightly patrols.
So when a series of odd burglaries is Cheetah, Silverback, Man-Bat, and Killer  Croc; Batman, Green Arrow, Nightwing, Red Robin, and the Flash team up to investigate and the trail leads to Oswald Cobblepotts who is about to commit the most audacious crime of them all - crash land the Midas asteroid right down on Gotham City.
While more Saturday morning cartoonish then previous animated Batman releases by Warner Brothers; there is a rather curious interplay going on between Nightwing and the Flash.  Nightwing reacts to the arrival of the Flash on the scene as somebody would when their mistake of one-night stand says ""Hey!"" and the two do share a hug at the end, which even Batman seems to raise an eyebrow at.

Super high action, a compelling storyline, amazing voice acting with the awesome bonus of Will Friedle of Batman Beyond as Nightwing. This is definitely a worthwhile investment if you are looking for super hero vs villain adventure and are a fan of Batman gadgets and superb storytelling without the need for a PG13 rating. Disregard any negative reviews that probably came from those that did not actually watch this fast paced feature. Tons of fun humor from Flash and Green Arrow a ruthless villain with an army of mechanical monsters.

7008999,3,B00TGJ1AJG,"As a guy who grew up with BTAS, I didn't buy this movie thinking/expecting a great experience. I bought it because it's a animated batman film I felt my son could enjoy.  It's relatively a straight forward, simple storyline. Set in a futuristic Gotham, this movie uses a collection of DC heroes and villains in its plot.  Futuristically resigned Flash, Nightwing, Green Arrow, Red Robin, and Batman pit their wits against Penguin, Cheetah, ManBat, and Killer Croc. The plot is straight forward, with some humorous one liners sprinkled in. As long as you aren't going into it expecting a Oscar-worthy script, you'll survive.  While it isn't my favorite movie, it's a re-imagination of some DC favorites for a younger viewing audience with plenty of merchandise opportunities (Batman has various ""suits"" in this movie, available to purchase in the toy isle).

In recent years, DC has released some great animated DC movies, but they not geared towards the younger audience/ little kids. While they are a great watch for someone older, I don't feel comfortable letting my 5 year old watch ""Justice League: War"".

If you are looking to have a movie that recaptures the depth and awesomeness of BTAS, keep moving. If you have a little one, this movie is a pretty safe watch.",1434067200,3,1269,4.911214953271028

The city is hit with a crime wave conducted by animals: Cheetah Woman, Silver Back, Killer Croc, and Man Bat. There are also mechanical animals working with them and a new guy in time who looks like the Penguin. Plot is not too difficult to figure out.

7009005,4,B00TGJ1AJG,"First and foremost know that this is NOT a gritty tale of the dark knight.  The target audience with this is kids.  Is it a long toy commercial? Yes. But so where 100% of all cartoons throughout the 80s, 90s, and most of the 00s and yet people still fondly remember that.  Now that we have that out of the way.  The animation is exactly the level it needs to be at. Is it going to blow your mind? Of course not. Is it decent and well animated? Yes.  The story? Its simple Penguin has rounded up an animal based group of villains for his bird brained scheme to get rich quick.  Flash and Green Arrow were tailing some of them back so they end up in the story.  Overall the plot is very thin, bad guys are doing bad things and good guys are gonna punch them in their evil face. That's it. You won't be seeing emotional displays of longing or anything like that in this movie.  Its colorful action movie with a lot actually pretty cool action scenes made to sell toys to little boys so they can play with them.  If you go into this knowing exactly what you are going to get and not putting impossibly high standards you will enjoy it.  If you are snob that expect every DC animated movie to be Dark Knight Returns this isn't for you.  But otherwise it is a fun movie you can get for younger kids to get into comics and still enjoy it yourself.",1433808000,3,1340,4.155038759689923
7009006,4,B00TGJ1AJG,"The Dark Knight returns for another toy line plug, but this one is actually pretty decent. Meant to tie-in to the Batman Unlimited action figure line, this is the first of two made-for-video flicks dealing with a more technophile Caped Crusaders who calls in some other DC Universe heroes to fight a new animal-themed supervillain gang.

Set in a more futuristic Gotham City, Batman is breaking his Batman Beyond prototype suit which comes with a hang glider function as he encounters a robot wolf. Nightwing corners Cheetah(Wonder Woman's nemesis)breaking into a jewelry store followed by Killer Croc, but Flash shows up to help him out. On another side of town, Green Arrow runs across the cybernetic gorilla Silverback who is aided by Man-Bat(who is introduced in this universe for the first time). It turns out that all these mutanimals are actually working for the local tycoon, Oswald Cobblepot, who in this version of Batman hasn't come out of the supervillain closet yet as the Penguin, and all of them together call themselves the Animalitia. The heroes team up along with Red Robin(allegedly the third Robin, Tim Drake with a tuft of hair sticking out of the back of his hood)and pull their resources in capturing Man-Bat along with three of the Penguin's robot army to discover that Cobblepot plans to bring a gold-filled meteor crashing into Gotham so he can wipe out any high society creeps that ever snubbed him, plus to get the fortune in space gold from the meteor. Batman finds a temporary cure for Man-Bat who is really Kirk Langstrom, the robot animals' designer, and the Batman Family heads out with their reprogrammed robots to stop Penguin and his zoo crew.

The animation in this was a little above the previous DC Universe movie based on a toy line, JLA Adventures, but this one definitely caters more towards pushing the action figures with Batman's multiple outfits which look like their rejected ideas from all the action figures they made in the 90s. There is some good nods to the regular DC continuity, like Man-Bat's design being similar to his original animated intro, plus Flash's obvious identity being Wally West from Justice League and Young Justice as he and Nightwing become ""hero bros"". The voice actors chosen are the biggest surprise with Roger Craig Smith from Arkham Origins again as Batman, Will Friedle formally Batman Beyond as Nightwing, Richard Epcar who played Joker in Injustice is Commissioner Gordon, Yuri ""Ben 10"" Lowenthal is Red Robin, and Dana ""Master Shake"" Snyder is pretty good as Penguin. Definitely give this one a spin if you want to show a decent Batman flick you don't have to worry about your kids seeing.",1433808000,2,2670,4.917960088691796
7009007,5,B00TGJ1AJG,"Created because Hasbro wanted to sell more toys, this is a fun movie with a good cast of heroes and villains.

7009010,3,B00TGJ1AJG,"So I really wasn't expecting much when i sat down to watch this. From the trailer it was very clear this was aimed at children with the clear purpose of selling toys. The plot (if you can call it that) revolves around The Penguin trying to crash a giant meteor with a golden center into Gotham city. He is joined by a robot monkey,bat, wolf and tiger. He also has allies of Killer Crock and Cheetah? (Where is Wonder Woman when you need her?) Batman is there to try to stop him with Flash, Green Arrow, Nightwing and Red Robin.

Its very reminiscent of the old 80's cartoons where they were one big commercial for Mattel. The voice acting is okay and the animation is pretty standard for a wannabe Bruce Timm production. Its not as bad as that god awful Batwoman direct to video cartoon but its not anything to write home about. Frankly I think most older kids (7-10) would be bored by this cartoon, while younger kids would just be happy to see Batman in some form or another.

DC has been dropping the ball lately with their animated movies, so in the end there is not much to expect from their animated features.",1433289600,2,1115,4.381642512077295

Red Robin acts dumb as rocks, Green Arrow is.....""off"" I should say and Cheetah gives Batman a difficult fight? What's going on here? It's watchable but don't expect anything memorable.",1433203200,,490,4.709302325581396
7009015,4,B00TGJ1AJG,"For all my ""hardcore"" DC movie lovers this one I would add to the collection.  This one is nothing related truly to the DC universe  as the others, it is its own story with a cool cast of good and bad guys to match.  To give a good idea, it matches Justice League kind of feel, the art style and even story kind of.  Batman is voiced by the same guy who did the last Batman Arkham game, not sure if you're a fan or not... But he did pretty well.

In short this is a good movie, not great, not bad either.  It fits a purpose as easy to watch and enjoy and has it's own story without sacrificing the characters or it's universe and roots to all characters.  I'd check it out.  To buy is up to you, I did take a chance and bought first but I dug it.  If like all things Batman related and looking to add to your collection, feel free to nab this one.

7009030,1,B00TGJ1AJG,"Batman Unlimited is an unusual mixture of Batman Beyond-style animation and comic counter-parts to this movie. Without spoiling the plot, the movie is another interpretation of how the classic Batman villain, The Penguin, makes his debut as Batman's new nemesis. To aid in Penguin's crime, a series of advanced robotics and animals aid Penguin in his criminal influence over Gotham. However, Batman isn't alone and his Bat-team and superhero allies will help him take on Penguin. While I am usually excited for any interpretation of Batman in most stories, this movie was overall bad as it had a terrible plot and actually made me feel bored watching it; the movie does has its moments, it isn't related to the Batman Beyond universe and had very little substance. I recommend Son of Batman, Robin Vs. Batman, The Dark Knight Returns, and Under The Red Hood before watching this.",1432252800,4,879,4.98639455782313

With this, I was wondering if it's too kiddy or dumbed down. I gave it a shot and I was pleasantly entertained. It was lighter in tone but action packed and fun. I don't get as bent out of shape over these like many do. Whether the show is more mature or lighter fare, they still are fun. Kids are safe with this one.

As for special features we get a 10 minute Penguin featurette, 10 DC Nation shorts, and 2 Brave and the Bold episodes.

7009039,5,B00TGJ1AJG,"I am sick of the Dark Knight persona, and I do want more Caped Crusader.  Batman Unlimited: Animal Instincts was refreshing.  Roger Craig Smith provided rich voice work to Batman, and the character is successfully revived for a new era.  I wish they didn't have Dick Grayson be Nightwing, but the trio of Batman, Red Robin, and Nightwing was fun.  In addition, we get to see Green Arrow and The Flash join in.  Green Arrow is portrayed in his classic persona, as the rich, Robin Hood answer to Batman; The Flash appears to incorporate elements of Wally West.  Batman doesn't act like a prick, and he works well with others to get the job done.
  The villains are also entertaining.  The Penguin is justly cast as the evil counterpart of Batman, and a man who hates people. The Animilitia makes sense, and Cheetah, Killer Croc, Silverback and Man-Bat are worthy of the screen time.  Cheetah is an interesting addition to Batman's Rogues Gallery; as she is a true ""Cat Woman"" who isn't romantically interested in Batman.  Silverback is his own man, and not a dumbed down doppelganger of Gorilla Grodd.
  Gotham City is huge and even slightly futuristic...but it makes sense.  Given that Gotham City has always been inspired by New York City, it was fun to see a glitzy Gotham City, instead of the foreboding imagery that we've gotten over the last few decades.  Given how the Marvel Heroes are featured on Disney XD, and manage to work well with others, this was nice.  Batman NEEDS to work with other heroes, and Gotham City is so huge, he can't be territorial.  As a longtime Batman fan, I loved this, and I hope action figures based on the heroes and villains come out by next year.",1431388800,15,1683,4.631756756756757

  This movie is great for kids.  As an adult I loved the quality of the movie itself.  Yes its for kids but they enlisted some over the best voice actors of the past games and movies.  I'm sry but Roger Craig Smith is one of the best voices of batman since Kevin.  Also it was great to hear Will Friedle as nightwing.
