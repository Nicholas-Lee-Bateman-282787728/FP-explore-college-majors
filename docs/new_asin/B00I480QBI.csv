6249682,5,B00I480QBI,"I used to watch the newest Miss Marple Series with my mother during the summers on PBS. It was a wonderful, cosy tradition that we shared. Now that I live far away from her, I have been searching for an alternative on PBS and stumbled across the Father Brown Mysteries. These are delightful! The scenery is wonderful, the costumes are so lovely, and it's a wonderful 45 minutes of escapism without all of the gritty blood and gore of a lot of crime programmes. Highly recommend this for some wonderful, cosy TV watching at any time of the year, but I'm looking forward to my own summertime full of Father Brown Mysteries!",1400284800,84,621,4.553571428571429

6249695,5,B00I480QBI,"I have not read the books, but show does say it is only ""based"" on the books. Looking for something new to watch, my daughter asked me to sit and watch this show she discovered. I was hooked after watching the first episode. I found it pleasant and easy to watch. It's entertaining. Not being British I found it surprising, and I was glad, that the actors look like real people. Actors did not have the expected photo shopped beauty.  The older characters were not reduced to being stupid, boring, loveless, useless, unkept, insane or nasty as in most American movies and shows. Their story-lines were just as interesting and meaty as the younger characters stories. You really look forward to the interaction of the main characters. I appreciated the fact that it contained no unnecessary nudity and that no foul language . Mark Williams was as excellent Father Brown. My favorite character was Lady Felicia played by Nancy Carroll. I was a bit confused as to why they kept changing Inspectors when they actors did such a fine job. Perhaps this was done in the books.  I do recommend watching it.",1507334400,,1097,4.708333333333333
6249696,5,B00I480QBI,"The series is great, but the Blu-Ray is Region B only.  I told the seller and they refunded my money, minus shipping and handling each way, but they
also blamed me for not reading their warning that the product would not work on American blu-ray players.  Luckily I didn't remove the shrink wrap. ""Region A/B/C"" is false!!!  ""Region B only"" is correct.  Why post contradictory statements???  Why post two photos of the front of the box, but none of the back??
The DVD's of this series have an above-average picture for DVD, by the way.
This is truly one of the best BBC series ever.  It dares discuss religion and is even better written than G.K. Chesterton's original stories, in my humble opinion.  The social problems in the early 1950's aren't as different from now as one would expect.  The characters are so compelling!  Typical BBC, characters keeping getting kicked off the series; that's the one disappointment.",1507248000,3,920,4.808917197452229
6249697,1,B00I480QBI,"The BBC has, of course, poured all of their usual money into a program that appears well-done on the surface.  However, this appearance did not even manage to fool me through to the end of the first episode.  This is NOT Chesterton, but a heavy-handed attempt at rubbing Christian noses in their 'intolerance"", right from the get-go.  The creators of this series waste no time letting viewers know that those who uphold traditional marriage or who believe in the biblical creation are not welcome to this relativistic, non-judgmental Father Brown tale.",1507248000,2,552,5.043956043956044

6249701,5,B00I480QBI,"Wonderful series!!! Mark Williams is a perfect Father Brown, humourous, energetic, always staying true to his faith. A clean show except for the Flambeau character. John Light portrays the villain gracefully however the violence associated with his episode saddened me. Violence and vulgarity was not why I was drawn to the show. I purchased Season 2 where a bit more violence was incorporated into the series, I'm hesitant to purchase more even though Nancy Carroll and Alex Price are given more screen time and add greatly as ""regulars"".",1502668800,,539,5.136363636363637

6249704,1,B00I480QBI,"I came to this BBC TV series as a big fan of Chesterton's fiction, particularly his Father Brown stories.  Chesterton was a Roman Catholic, and is considered to be one of the strongest Christian contributors to 20th century fiction, along with Tolkien and Lewis.  His detective stories are especially charming and deep, and his love of wit and paradox, and ability to write terse and profound one-liners is remarkable.  The BBC series largely focuses on the character of Father Brown, and script writers were given freedom to work with the existing stories, adapting them at will, or to ignore them entirely and create something entirely original. The result was that only half of the initial lot of 10 episodes were based on Chesterton's short stories, and those very loosely at best; the overall impression has little in common with the Chesterton's Father Brown.

Does this matter?  Not necessarily, as long as it's done well, and still within the spirit of the original character. The Father Brown character is an endearing one, and other TV series have demonstrated that a Poirot or Holmes type detective can have a life far beyond what their creators like Agatha Christie or Arthur Doyle ever imagined.  British crime series often focus on charming characters and delightful settings, especially when these reflect an earlier period in history, and these are all strengths of the BBC's Father Brown series.  However, in many respects this series doesn't live up to the standards of detective films like the ones mentioned, nor does it live up to Chesterton's original fiction. The issue here isn't a matter of faithfulness to the original, and that any departure from this is anathema, but rather whether the TV series captures the elements of the original that made Father Brown a legend in the world of fiction to begin with.  The producers have evidently made a choice to make this a very modern production, and even though it is set in the 1950s, they've introduced many anachronisms that not only don't fit with the 1950s, but also don't fit with Chesterton's world or his vision.

Let me illustrate my point by commenting just on the first episode, Hammer of God.  The TV version begins with Catholics and Anglicans enjoying a combined social event, which is more reflective of modern ecumenism than it is of the 1950s, or of Chesterton's world.  While Chesterton's ""Hammer of God"" has only vague hints of possible marital infidelity, and at most the suggestion that the villain was making advances to the blacksmith's wife, in the TV series he not only beds her, but does so as payment for the blacksmith's gambling debt; furthermore, he turns out to be a closet homosexual, and for his out-of-touch clergyman brother this becomes the motive for murder.  Father Brown comes across as an emancipated and liberal theologian who is open to theories of evolution, non-judgmental, and is prepared to be use the privilege of confidentiality from the confessional booth mean he can approach people and assure them their secrets are safe with him.

These modern themes might appeal to and reflect a modern audience, but they embody a worldview and set of morals very much at odds with Chesterton's.  What's more, a wonderful opportunity has been missed by failing to capitalize on the brilliant one-liners and paradoxical language that makes Chesterton's stories so wonderful to begin with.  Virtually none of this clever dialogue has been carried over into the TV series ""Hammer of God"" episode at any rate, even though in the Chesterton canon this story is regarded as one of his all-time best for exactly that reason.  The TV series might take some of the characters from Chesterton, and some loose plot ideas, but that's about it - for the rest is a distinctly modern series that promotes contemporary values, and reflects very little of Chesterton's original.  Not only would Chesterton not approve; he'd probably be horrified. - GODLY GADFLY (August 2017)",1502064000,8,3966,4.993930197268589

6249706,3,B00I480QBI,"The earlier Father Brown series with Kenneth More was excellent.  I even bought the DVD's.  So I was really looking forward to the newer series.  On the plus side are the lovely sets, the attention to detail, and all the things that make British period pieces the very best.  But the unbelievably rudeness of the police to Father Brown is not funny to me.  And the ""over the top"" remarks and manner of Mrs. McCarthy are not amusing either.  It is still better watching than many other shows.  But it could have been so much better without these attempts at humor.  Father Brown does a good job, except he simply overlooks all these outrageous remarks made to him or about him!  Oh well....just my opinion.",1499817600,,705,4.576
6249707,5,B00I480QBI,"The Father Brown series, inspired by G.K. Chesterton's amateur sleuth stories, consistently delivers intriguing narratives that are sure to satisfy mystery lovers and anglophiles alike.  Each episode bursts with lush photography of English country sides and art direction that faithfully recreates the post-war period of World War II.  The characters are rife with personality thanks to strong writing and performances, and the classic who-done-it setup never grows stale, always allowing one to uncover clues with the priest-detective without feeling duped by the climatic reveal towards the end.

The show's creators politely wink at the audience with Father Brown's frequent run ins with criminal varieties and their schemes, yet the situations keep the suspense moving forward against the backdrop of seemingly quiet parish life, and above all the material remains respectful to the integrity of the main character's first vocation, the priesthood, which is sure to please viewers of faith.  Catholic viewers in particular will be satisfied to find their Faith portrayed accurately for the most part and woven into the thematic development of each plot.  Not only does the gentle, mild-mannered Father Brown possess a reputable acumen for solving difficult cases, but his motivation for justice is also grounded in his merciful concern for the salvation of souls, including those of the villains.  Its great entertainment surprisingly invested with moral and spiritual value made accessible by a warm and compassionate character.",1499299200,,1533,5.6147186147186146

6249713,3,B00I480QBI,"Ive streamed five seasons of Father Brown, so this is a review of the entire series. And as I have not read the books from which the series takes its name, Im judging the series on its own merits. Each episode runs about 45 minutes, and, not surprisingly, the size of the cast and the extent of the settings are more modest than those of a series offering episodes of twice that length. The basic plot runs thusly: a murder occurs in Father Browns neighborhood; Father Brown offers to assist the investigating inspector; said inspector rolls his eyes and tells Father Brown to leave the investigating to the professionals; the police proceed to arrest, quickly and often on the flimsiest of evidence, a suspect; Father Brown investigates on his own and solves the crime, exonerating the suspect; the investigating inspector begrudgingly acknowledges Father Browns assistance, only to revert to being a fool in the next episode.

I found the first three seasons to be better than the final two, due in part to cast changes. Indeed, only two characters, Father Brown (Mark Williams) and Mrs. McCarthy (Sorcha Cusack), appear in all 60 episodes. Contributing to the decline of the series in the last two seasons were the loss of two regulars, Lady Felicia and Sid Carter, and the introduction of Inspector Mallory as a new foil for Father Brown. Inspector Mallory is played too hammy to be taken seriously (I expected him to wink at the audience at any moment).

In the spectrum of British TV mystery series, Father Brown, in terms of episode length and the quality of the stories, cast, and production is similar to Rosemary & Thyme. The mysteries are too light to satisfy the fans of series like Inspector Lewis, but they're done well enough to be a pleasant diversion for many viewers.",1496534400,,1785,4.811074918566775

6249715,4,B00I480QBI,"What I love about this: the post WWII society that BBC set this story in. Like all BBC period pieces, it doesn't skimp on world-building. The attention to detail about the pre-Vatican II Catholic religion is extremely commendable and in fact flawless. The actors are all extremely good, particularly the actors who portray Sid and Father Brown and Hercule Flambeau. What I'm meh about: the episode plots are of uneven quality, some very good, some blah, some kind of dumb. I thought they handled GK Chesterton's most famous Father Brown story, ""The Sign of the Broken Sword,"" not well. And I did roll my eyes at the lame attempts to inject 21st century political correctness into a show set in post WWII society. But I found many episodes that I enjoyed, so overall was satisfied. It's frankly wonderful to see a show starring such unusual characters as a middle-aged priest and his sidekick, an elderly female housekeeper. Original and refreshing casting.",1493942400,6,956,4.944099378881988

6249728,1,B00I480QBI,"Perhaps this production is a reflection of Postmodern Deconstructionism. More likely it is just stupid, bigoted, and ham-handed writing. Thankfully I did not purchase this item. I checked it out of my local library. I could only bring myself to watch two episodes before hitting the eject button. I join other 1 star reviewers in wondering if the creators of this BBC series ever bothered to read the source material. Clearly they are grossly unfamiliar with Chesterton's thinking revealed in the massive amount of his fiction and non-fiction writings. In the episode ""The Wrong Shape"" the scurrilous writers put into Father Brown's mouth (and by extension, Chesterton's) the ridiculous statement that one should not take too seriously the accounts of miracles found in the New Testament. If the name of the show was Atheist Brown or Freudian Therapist Brown the statement would make sense. Which leads one to wonder why the writers of the show did not just make up their own character instead of hijacking another writer's character and making him a ventriloquist's dummy for their own ideas. Obviously the answer is that the show is an unethical, greedy rip off.
The other episode I watched was ""The Hammer of God"" which has only the thinnest resemblance to the original story and which is made to serve as a brainwashing exercise, attacking those who hold a moral objection to homosexual behavior, a subject not even present in Chesterton's original story. I happen to disagree with much of Chesterton's theology but there is in his writing a baseline of common decency, common sense, and common courtesy which are becoming increasingly rare in our ""culture"" as reflected in the ""Father Brown"" series..",1487289600,13,1705,5.0711743772241995
6249729,1,B00I480QBI,"This remake of Father Brown is terrible.  I watched the first episode, and it is completely unlike the book.  The plot pushes the modernist agenda.

6249753,4,B00I480QBI,"I am enjoying the FATHER BROWN series and have purchased the other seasons and I'm on Season 3.

I never read the G.K. Chesterton books so I don't know how the show compares, and I read some reviews on the series that do not like the characterization of Chesterton's priest, but I enjoy the show.

The first season introduces us to the cast which include Father Brown, his church secretary Mrs. McCarthy, his maid Susie, church goer Lady Felicia and her driver Sid(ney) Carter. In this season Lady Felicia and Sid aren't featured in as many episodes as the next seasons (where actors Nancy Carroll and Alex Price get billing in the beginning title sequence) and the cast of four congeal as a group that belong together.  Mrs. McCarthy is in every episode as a supporting character and is portrayed by Sorcha Cusack, and the ""Susie"" character -- played by actress Kasia Koleczek -- is only in this season.

I don't know if these character were in the book or if the actors match their written counterparts, but I enjoy the cast. Lady Felicia is a cougar who is married to a man named Monty who we never see and very rich. She's the screamer in the group and lets out these blood curdling screams everytime they come across a dead body. Sid, ends up as Lady Felicia's chauffeur, is a guy who grows up disadvantaged so he's a hustler with a good heart. Mrs. McCarthy and her ""award winning strawberry scones"" is an old bitty who likes to judge and run her mouth. At first I didn't like the character of ""Mrs. McCarthy"" who is a gossiping busybody, but Cusack plays the character with great comedic timing in her expressions and cutting remarks that I've grown found of her. In fact I look forward to seeing her in the scenes, especially with Lady Felicia, as they let each other have it with biting remarks. Father Brown is a priest who can pick locks as well as winning horses, and isn't judgemental towards others or self-righteous. He gives the criminals reasons as to why they should turn themselves in and will never reveal anything that's been told in confession. And he rides a bike with in his cassock flapping in the wind (which must be a specially made on because I'm wondering how his flowing robes don't get caught in the tire chain?).

Before I bought Season 1 to stream, I DVR'd one episode which is currently on PBS from Season 4 to make sure that I would enjoy this show because I was worried that it would be preachy or something along those lines but it isn't. And you don't have to be a religious person to watch it.

I purchased the SD (Standard Definition) option and the picture is nice and sharp so I don't see how the HD version could be improved, and I have bought the next two seasons that are available (3 Seasons in all) as season 4 is still on air. There are no special features on the streaming videos.

If you like mysteries, especially ones that take place in a different time, then you'll like FATHER BROWN. If you're a fan of the books you better rent or buy one episode to watch to see if you like the adaptation. I would give 5-stars, but I think Season 2 and 3 are the 5-star worthy ones as the cast is settled and the scripts get better.",1477267200,11,4094,5.278033794162827
6249754,3,B00I480QBI,"The titular character is a likeable fellow. I'm not quite sure of his methods though in solving the mysteries. Like other reviewers I question the choice of moving the time period to the 1950's. And I too feel that too many of them have contemporary attitudes towards certain things as opposed to what you'd more likely find in that time and place, but not so much as to ruin the stories. I'm not from England, so I can't say too much about the location change except that for a small, quiet, English country town, Kembleford has an alarmingly high homicide rate comparable to some of the larger cities of the day. And almost all of the mysteries in season 1 do feature a murder (sometimes multiple murders), or at least suspected murder. Although I've never read the short stories by G. K. Chesterton I understand that Father Brown traveled about and some of the murders happened outside his parish, which is more feasible than them all happening in a small countryside town. Seriously the ""Welcome to Kembleford. Population: ____"" sign must be written on a dry erase board. Most of the other characters are alright, although Inspector Valentine seems pretty two dimensional. You'd think after Father Brown managed to solve so many cases he'd get over his annoyed, irritated, ""rid me of this meddling priest"" attitude. It wears thin after a few episodes. Looking ahead I see that he is not in season 2, nor is Susie (damn). Is this another BBC show that can't keep its actors from season to season? At least it looks like they go and create new characters instead of using multiple actors to play the same person *cough*Hugh Beringar*cough*! I still prefer Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett, not these Jonny-come-latelys) and Cadfael (Derek Jacobi) and will have to do some thinking before I decide whether to purchase the subsequent seasons or not.",1477180800,,1846,4.826498422712934

6249766,5,B00I480QBI,"Cozy mysteries, particularly those produced by the BBC, are thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  Father Brown is a refreshing and poignant mystery series.  Mark Williams brings compassion, humor and vulnerability to an endearing character.  Television is filled with tough-acting cops and amateur sleuths who have abundant problems.  Therefore, it is enjoyable to find a series where the main character, though imperfect, genuinely cares for the victims and criminals he pursues.

Father Brown's parish in the village of Kilmbersford also has some likable and amusing characters.  Mrs. McCarthy with her ""award-winning strawberry scones"" has a penchant for gossip but a hilarious and astute disposition.  Lady Falecia has a tendency to give herself airs but is kind at heart.  And, perhaps my favorite character is Susie, the parish housekeeper.  She is an immigrant from Poland, and her determination to gain equality and her vulnerability are wonderful to see.  My favorite episodes in this set are:

1.  ""The Hammer of God"": When Father Brown and his parishoners attend the dedication of a newly-built church for some Anglican neighbors, the Anglican minister's cruel brother shows up with intentions to ruin the party.  Soon, he is discovered with his head brutally bashed in.  Many people wanted this man dead, but who is the culprit? This story has been updated significantly from the original story by G.K. Chesterton, but the overall theme is still present and beautifully conveyed.
2.  ""The Wrong Shape"": Father Brown, Lady Falecia and Mrs. McCarthy attend a poetry reading at an eccentric millionaires mansion.  When the host is found dead, the close-knit but unconventional family come under suspicion.  The resolution is heartwarming, and Father Brown truly exhibits his compassion and willingness to treat every person with dignity.
3.  ""The Man in the Tree"": A visiting German priest is coming to Kilmbsford to speak at a peace rally.  But a mysterious man is found hanging in a tree near death.  As Father Brown tries to unravel the man's identity, Susie struggles with fear and mistrust of the German visitor.  A very poignant story.
4.  ""The Eye of Apollo"": A visiting religious group with a charismatic leader makes Father Brown nervous.  When Susie is drawn into the group, Father Brown must face a frightening culprit in order to keep her safe.  Disturbing story that shows the lengths we will go to get what we want.
5.  ""The Bride of Christ"": A nun dies of cyanide poisoning just before she is to take her final vows.  But she was fasting, so how could the poison have been administered? When a visiting nun from India is also poisoned, Father Brown, along with Sister Boniface, must find the culprit before others are hurt.  This story was my favorite in the set, and the resolution is beautiful.
6.  ""The Blue Cross"": Father Brown receives a mysterious message: ""To catch a thief, look to the Cross"".  He goes on a frantic mission to keep a valuable holy relic safe, but he must pit wits against the cunning and devious thief, Flambeau.  The culprit in this episode is very frightening, and the story is suspenseful at every turn.

Please give this riveting collection of mysteries a chance.  They are thoroughly entertaining.  God bless you all.",1474761600,,3265,5.0543071161048685

6249813,2,B00I480QBI,"After reading most of the reviews posted here so far, it pretty much boils down to this: If you love the G.K. Chesterton original stories, you are going to be upset with this series. The character G.K. Chesterton created may look and sound what you would imagine ""Father Brown"" to be like, but that's pretty much as far as the resemblance goes. Don't get me wrong: Mark Williams is a good actor, the supporting cast is fine, the production values are very good. If you want a kind of ""Miss Marple"" murder mystery, then this is a good series for you. If you want something close to the Chesterton original, this won't satisfy you at all. Despite the ""live television theater"" feel of the old Kenneth More series from over 30 years ago, THAT series was a heck of a lot closer to what Chesterton probably had in mind. If you want to see the closest thing yet to the Chesterton novels, I'd recommend searching for two old films: FATHER BROWN DETECTIVE (1934) with Walter Connolly giving a superb performance as ""Fr. Brown,"" and THE DETECTIVE (c. 1957) with the always reliable Alec Guinness as the good father is just about as good.

It's a shame this new series does such a disservice to Chesterton's characters. The BBC writers realized that depicting Chesterton's stories for a new television audience would be hard work. G.K. Chesterton wrote for a broad audience - but a fairly educated audience that knew at least something about classical literature and history. Because of our more modern ""progressive"" education system of the last 40 years or so, most of the ""clues"" Chesterton laid out in his stories would have audiences baffled today. Would it be impossible to faithfully transfer the Chesterton stories to video today in an entertaining fashion. No, I don't think so. Difficult - perhaps. But it seems as if the writers here didn't even try. The worst thing about the series is how Father Brown's character has been watered down to the extent that he no longer has strong opinions on what is the right thing to do - he just goes about his business, trying not to offend anybody for the most part. That is NOT what Chesterton's character was all about. Chesterton's detective priest was deceptively ""dumpy"" or mild-mannered, but there was a real brain working behind that flabby exterior, along with a heart that worked hard to get those on the wrong path back on the right one. Some of that IS in the character Mark Williams portrays here, but not enough!

The idea of updating the time to more liberal post-WWII England could have been cleverly handled in that the original Father Brown character might have really have his work cut out for him in such a changing society - but here, the character just kind of ""goes with the flow,"" something I believe G.K. Chesterton would NOT be happy about! There's nothing wrong with giving the series a kind of ""situation comedy"" feel with the recurring characters Fr. Brown deals with on a daily basis - it's worked for Agatha Christie's ""Poirot"" series and E.D. Biggers' ""Charlie Chan"" - and it gives a warm-hearted kind of feel here, but the series as a whole is too far removed from the Chesterton originals.",1458172800,5,3161,4.703971119133574

6249855,5,B00I480QBI,"I have not read any of G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown novels, so I can't speak to how true to the books this series is. I tend to be a purist in matters of books made into movies or TV shows and am easily disappointed if they do not follow to book to the letter. So I am glad that I HAVEN'T read any of Father Brown because I adore this show. The characters are all well-known types of the period mystery genre, and there is perhaps nothing very unique in this series, but for what it is, it is well done. The characters are quirky and likable and the acting is good. I also love Mark Williams as Father Brown. I disagree with reviews that state that Father Brown does not seem to be a devout Catholic--on the contrary, he comes across as so secure in his belief and faith that he never becomes ruffled when others disagree with his views, and he is more interested in saving souls than debating theology. I wish my priest were Father Brown, I'd never miss a Sunday! Wonderful series to watch when you're in the mood for a not-too-scary-or-gorey murder mystery. Very Agatha Christie.",1453939200,5,1084,4.371287128712871

6249914,1,B00I480QBI,"Chesterton is one of my favourite writers and I was really looking forward to watching this series. The experience turned out to be very disappointing. I can't understand why the creators of the series butchered the original Chesterton stories. The first episode (""The Hammer of God"") was just dumbed down with motivations of the characters greatly simplified. The second one (""The Flying Stars"") was a total disaster. To throw away the whole Father Brown's monologue addressed to Flambeau, one of the most powerful and memorable moments in all the Father Brown stories! Well, they've cut out Flambeau as well and made Inspector Valentine an Englishman. I just don't understand the point. Is Chesterton considered  too complex, too deep for the modern audience? Or did the hack writer they've hired to write the script think he can do better than G.K.C.?

Overall the series aren't that bad. If you never read the original stories you would probably enjoy this adaptation. Just another English detective story, in line with Agatha Christie's Miss Marple or Poirot adaptations. It's just that Chesterton's Father Brown stories are something much more than a sleuthing story. Each one is a parable telling us something important about the human nature. And that's the part this adaptation totally ruins, intentionally or not. Shame on you, Brits! You don't have that many truly great writers to treat one of them like this.",1440979200,16,1421,5.120689655172414

forgives us our sins no matter what, but only If we admit, take
responsibility and actually step up and confess. No excuses. You are
faced with your sins and either chose the path to the right or the path
to the left. What is delightful about this program are the superb
actors and their interpretation of life's constant challenges! Pretty
cool amide this anti-God World. Keep them coming!!! I have passed on my

6249975,2,B00I480QBI,"If you love the l writing of G K Chesterton and the strong and incisive spiritual insights of the Father Brown character, you may prefer the older version of this series.  This newer version has much better production values and beautiful scenery, but Father Brown has been so watered down (to be palatable to the current culture I would guess), his character is so bland and retiring he is almost unrecognizable. The stories, while happening in and around the Anglican church, have been pretty much sanitized of any actual Christian content.  This is such a shame because Father Brown has been one of the best Christian characters in literature; intelligent, compassionate and wise, while still being human and down to earth, unafraid to call people out when needed, and having a great sense of humor, especially about himself.",1433808000,13,828,4.992753623188406

6249986,1,B00I480QBI,"This BBC reproduction re-imagines what Fr Brown would be like if he never quoted from, or sounded like, GK Chesterton. It is Chesterton without Chesterton -- not weak tea but rather lukewarm water with no tea at all. It is a flavorless exercise in pointlessness -- a work of fiction with the marks of true existential meaninglessness as its primary hallmarks done in Chesterton's name. It is almost as if the creators are con artists executing a dopey frame job.

The show needlessly transports the titular character from a time that resembles our own to post-war Britain for absolutely no reason other than precluding any possibility to use Chesterton's prophetic wit as a foil to the very issues we grapple with today.

This is a Father Brown who never talks like Father Brown, never says anything Chestertonian, and thinks little of his own faith. He is easily silenced by a cultist's facile comparison of Catholicism to his own deceptive ramblings, angered by trivial matters, gluttonous, surrounded and henpecked by an all-female lay hierarchy, and never possessed of the gift of penetrating insight. In short, this is Father Brown as he would be written by Modernists who are shamefully unaware of who Chesterton is, what he stood for, and how he stood for it. Not only is this Father Brown without the mind of Chesterton, at least once an episode he says something antithetical to the fictional priest or the flesh and blood writer.

""Don't worry, I won't try to convert you,"" he promises a homosexual atheist in the very first episode. (Note: the issue of homosexuality is shoehorned into the first episode because the agenda must be followed, apparently.)

Excuse me? When was Father Brown NOT interested in converting those he met? He never let the idle lies of Modernists and atheists drop without a devastating retort delivered with his usual unassuming aplomb. But he was always interested in defending his faith and leading others to it. It was central to his whole demeanor.

The series bears little similarity to Chesterton's stories. The mysteries are dull and surprisingly un-mysterious. Details are needlessly altered, tensions are disappointingly dumbed down and philosophical/ideological/theological differences, rather than serving as portals to the characters' souls, are papered over.

You would think that even in the fifties there are still plenty of opportunities for our priest protagonist to drop the occasional Chestertonian observation or clever retort and there are. The problem is, this Father Brown never says them. When confronted he rises to the occasion by speaking only in dull one-liners that could have been penned by an atheist teenager. This is the real terrible crime (but alas not a mystery, Brits hate God). Chesterton took great pains to understand the thinking and worldview of his opponents, be they atheists or Adventists, and illustrate how the ideologies animate his characters. Yet these writers demonstrate a patent inability to enter the mind of a devout and confident Catholic. This does a disservice to adherents of any philosophy, must less Chesterton's belief system.

And it is embarrassing to see a production done in his name by pretenders who clearly have not read a single word of his work. ""Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear,"" the Kenneth More Fr Brown would say, ""this will never do.""",1432512000,110,3341,5.096892138939671

While the name and a few characteristics of the actual Father Brown (the author's Father Brown - of the actual stories of Father Brown by the author) are given to the show's character, the stories are not functionally taken from the actual FB stories we who have read know and appreciate and they give anyone not familiar with the actual stories a poor picture of FB as a snoopy Jane Marple or J.B. Fletcher.
Oh, for those unfamiliar, the real stories take place in a number of locations all over England and the Continent,
 frequently involve Flambeau as a helper of FB and who had been (important distinction) a thief and were often a higher level of importance than local village stuff.

I love the setting of a small town in England with its quaint village and quirky characters set in the 1950's.  It is slower paced with very little violence and is fun to watch.

6250058,5,B00I480QBI,"I absolutely LOVED this series and was very surprised that I did.  I normally hate anything to do with religion because I don't like the preachiness but this show stayed away from that.  Father Brown is a British Catholic priest in the 1950's.  While attending to his flock he is often caught up in village murders.  This show is refreshing as the priest is non judgemental and totally accepting of all those around and while he assist the police with their investigations, he is more concerned with saving souls than arresting killers.

This show is appropriate for most ages.  There is minimal violence, no foul language or sexual situations.  An enjoyable, interesting show.",1424908800,,677,4.938053097345133

I thought that if I set aside Chesterton's actual stories (which these bear only superficial resemblance to), I might find something at least charming. But the title character Father Brown is just not. He doesn't infuse the village with any particular affection or grace other than to drop occasional feel-good advice, and seems in fact to be less interesting than most of the other characters. He's not witty, more than averagely perceptive of the human heart or condition, or keenly intelligent.

Chesterton (or Agatha Christie) writing about ""lesbian lovers"" killing off two young women for greed and some convoluted reasons. The nuns in it were made to look like idiots and ungodly people. I really can't recommend this series.

The older Fr Brown Series (i think from the 60s) maybe the technical filming quality isn't as good because of the transferred process, but the stories are more entertaining.

Father Brown is so low-key and unassuming, but maintaining a pulse on the community at large.  He is played against the feisty, but narrow-minded secretary, which proves humorous.  And the other permanent characters are wonderful, as well.  Meanwhile, Father reminds us of each character's sad, lonesome or poor background.

6250116,1,B00I480QBI,"Had i not read the Father Brown detective short stories, i would have thoroughly enjoyed this version of Father Brown. Unfortunately for me however, I have  read the book and watched the series done by  ITV. Although the ITV version is  a bit dated, it stays  true to the novelist G.K. Chesterton's work. I was really excited when i discovered that the BBC had decided to rejuvenate  Father Brown....until i watched it. Unfortunately the only thing the BBC version has in common with  Chesterton's work, is the title. All the key elements of the stories have been altered. Not to be a spoiler but  in  The Hammer of God for instance,  In the book, the blacksmith is a religious fanatic who spends a lot of time at revival meetings whilst his adulterous wife cheats on him. BBC decided that the story worked better if the blacksmith was portrayed as a gambler and his wife was  the ""good wife"" who is forced into adultery  to help offset his gambling debts. For some reason BBC writers decided  to introduce themes into the story that Chesterton never addressed;  they decided to revise Colonel Bohun's sexuality by casting him as bi-sexual and replaced ""Mad Joe"" with a scientist who also happens to be the colonel's gay lover. To spice up the story further, they decided to throw in a community of Polish immigrants.....and yes Father Brown's cleaning lady is Polish (talk about stereo types!!). If you know nothing about the novelist G.K Chesterton's work and you have no intention of ever reading his Father Brown short stories, then i can guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy these series. If on the other hand you have read the book and watched the older series, then this version will just annoy you.",1417305600,30,1710,4.736486486486487

There is a touch of spirituality in the episodes.  The series takes place during the 1950's so the pace is slower, the crimes not terribly sensational.

6250120,5,B00I480QBI,"Love Father Brown series. I stumbled upon this show when I was looking for one of my Marple faves and after the first episode I was hooked. I am not familiar with the Author of the written series or any other past actors, so all I know is this particular Father Brown. The characters play very well off one another rarely missing a beat. Most of the shows have a moral decision or dilemma besides murder and the writing blends so perfectly between the two problems. Of the shows in the first season my picks are shows 1and 4, 'Gods Hammer' and ""Misshapen', respectively. The story lines were two of the most deeply heartbreaking topics between brothers, forgiveness and a mother/child/husband, whilst having great humor- I think a very delicate balance. To me no one could play Father Brown better. The acting as Brits say is Spot On! I await more shows as I have watched season ones repeatedly. If you enjoy British humor, deep story lines, beautiful Country scenes, sleuthing, and wonderful acting watch Father Brown. Another great series from the UK!",1417132800,,1053,4.759562841530054

The performances of the actors are convincing and I appreciated the content: intriguing but not graphic or sensationalized, entertaining, not preachy but life affirming.

Most people do not connect to a rectory and thus, while Ballykissangel centered on a priest and a community, the social hub was Fitzgerald's, a pub. Here, there's no true connection, even though some of the characters work in the rectory and with the priest. Never quite did it for me.",1414368000,,530,5.103448275862069

Looking at the other episodes in the series, some have the same names as Chesterton's stories, but appear to have been gutted like ""Hammer of God."" The others appear to  be new stories using the names of Chesterton's characters, but lacking his substance.

6250161,1,B00I480QBI,"The BBC need not wait for Father Brown to consign it to hell. I'll do it now. They've ruined everything innocent they've touched. Blandings, a travesty of Wodehouse, the new Dr. Who with all it's trickier than thou tired ulterior motives and not so hidden agendas, and now trashing Chesterton's sleuth, Father Brown, with unwatchable, unthinkable, unimaginable rubbish like ""The Hammer of God"". Chesterton wrote plenty of stories. It's not necessary for the worst writers of today to write others, nor the worst directors to dirty them up, nor stick in their trashy anti-male biases. Nor is it in any way an advance that they have found their way behind a camera instead of on a shrink's couch or at a confessional where they belong.
One had hoped that the BBC might at least make an attempt at this series. ITV/ Granada managed to make out a decent two seasons sometime back. But then they don't have endless post-modern axes to grind, and they may know what the present BBC staff does not, that decadence makes bad art. As the real Chesterton said, ""Art, like morality, consists of drawing the line somewhere,"" a bit of wisdom apparently lost on the BBC.

Despite the fact that I love watching Top Gear, I'd never watch BBC America, because like so many American channels, its directors seem incapable of drawing the line somewhere. Fortunately, anyone literate can simply read the real Father Brown stories (and the many novels and mysteries not featuring Father Brown) by Chesterton, and avoid the BBC's failed versions altogether.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Brown-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B00HYZ0ZLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Brown:The Complete Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Father-Brown-Stories/dp/1853260037/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Father Brown Stories</a>.",1412035200,35,2236,6.310457516339869

Otherwise, the TV series does not even come close to resembling the book. All of the stories are either made up, or an original Chesterton story is twisted beyond recognition. Strange characters that are not in the book are running about, a very dumb police who very often grabs the wrong suspect on the slightest suspicion that does not have any logic behind it and drags him/her to prison or even the gallows...

6250166,1,B00I480QBI,"As my age increases, I am becoming increasingly crotchety about what I watch on television.  Unfortunately, this series provoked all my crotchety and purist instincts, and not in a good way.  My praise for this series begins with the casting of Father Brown, which is excellent (except that he is supposed to be short).  Unfortunately, that is also where my praise ends.  G.K. Chesterton would recognize nothing about this series if he happened to be available to watch it.  It is as far from its ostensible model as it could be, short of portraying Father Brown as an alien who has come to earth to solve crimes.  I loved the short stories, which depend on a benevolent and brilliant rationality employed by the detective to solve very human crimes.  The first British series is much more true to the original than this one (it could hardly be less so), and I recommend it.  But first and foremost, read the stories.  They are fascinating and clever, and available all in one handy volume.  Alas, none of the wonderful attributes of the stories is shared by the current series.  The plots were ready-made in the stories for the screen writers--they should have used them.",1409788800,51,1172,4.752475247524752

6250169,5,B00I480QBI,"Charming ""cozy mystery"". A cross between ""PIE IN THE SKY"" and a thumbnail version of ""MIDSOMER MURDERS"" with this difference; instead of a chef/investigator or DCI there is a quirkily genial country priest who's interest is personal atonement for the miscreant and resolution for the victim's nearest & dearest rather than vengeance or the hangman's noose. There are lovely Gloucestershire Village of Blockley locations, true to the period costumes, and a fine ensemble cast playing off one another in a wiley and entertaining manner. The suspects are developed reasonably well given the 45 minute time constraints with the emphasis on the characters and their time & place (circa 1950s) presented in a satirical, slyly humorous and occasionally nonsensically over the top style. There are serious moments, but mostly it's in good fun. As expected, there is no profanity or heavy gore. Light summer fare or when shut in during winter with the proverbial cup of tea. This delightful mystery-whodunnit has been renewed by the BBC for a third season and filming (15 more episodes) will begin latter in 2014 and will be available on DVD in 2015. Father Brown is subtitled.

Purists be forewarned: Although not as obligatory PC vandalized as most contemporary adoptations of period drama, Father Brown 2013 is slanted to appeal to modern sensibilities rather than fidelity to G.K Chesterton's original themes or characters. Viewers would be advised to enjoy this series on it's own merits.",1405814400,64,1484,5.2092050209205025

6250171,5,B00I480QBI,"Time-travel to 1950's England. The charming village of Kembleford, Cotswolds, is home to the Catholic church of St. Mary's. Its priest is Father Brown, warm, open, absentminded, and easily distracted - unless he is solving a mystery. Then he is tenacious, logical and intuitive. After all, being able to understand somebody can be just as important to a detective as it is to a man of the cloth. Father Brown is great fun to watch in these 10 mysteries. He is devout, and uses moral suasions, but he is neither preachy nor judgemental.

These are cozies rather than police procedurals and there is a lot of humor, too. The main character is based on the mysteries by G.K. Chesterton. who wrote 51 Father Brown short stories in the early 1900's. (And which I find rather outdated reading.) Kembleford has a constabulatory, of course, and Detective Valentine is always warning Father Brown to mind his own business, which makes it interesting when the priest solves his cases for him. The church secretary, Mrs. McCarthy is a terrible gossip, but she is devoted to Father Brown and takes great pride in the village, the parish, and her Award Winning Scones.

""Father Brown"" originally aired in January, 2013 on BBC. It has a total of 469 minutes of no-gore mysteries.

English subtitles are available on the DVD/BueRay sets. There is one Bonus Feature on the last disc. The shows are shown in 16:9 ratio and Dolby Digital 5.1.

[Edited to add] The 10 episodes in Season 2 originally aired in January, 2014, and are now available:

....Episode 1. ""The Hammer of God"" In ecumenical spirit, Father Brown attends a celebration at Kembleford's Anglican church. It's the first time the bell will be rung in its refurbished bell tower. Unfortunately for the Anglican minister, his day is marred by his brother, Norman's, nastiness. Going inside, the despairing minister tells Norman, ""I'm cutting you off. Father left a clause in the inheritance. It entrusts me with the purse strings... I'm invoking it... You're out of control.""
Before that, Norman was selfish, arrogant and cruel. Now he is desperate, selfish, arrogant and cruel.
....Episode 2. ""The Flying Stars"" Mrs. McCarthy and Father Brown walk across the fields for a birthday party for Ruby, only child of the Adams'. What they don't hear is Mrs. Adams snarling to her husband, ""Catholic marriage is til death do us part.... The only way I leave this marriage is in a coffin.""
....Episode 3. ""The Wrong Shape"" Lady Felicia takes Father Brown and Mrs. McCarthy to a poetry recital. Not usually their cup of tea, but the poet, Leonard Quinton, has asked the priest to come specifically. It's a very odd gathering. The poet, his reclusive wife, his effusive mistress and his impolite solicitor. Father Brown asks why he was invited. Quinton replies: ""I would like you to look after my wife, Father, if anything should happen to me."" And something does.
The medicine isn't named in the show, but I believe it is thalidomide. It was sold over-the-counter for anti-nausea and morning sickness in the late 50's. Worldwide, 10,000 birth defects were attributed to thalidomide, and it is the reason why we have more stringent drug regulations.
....Episode 4. ""The Man in the Tree"" Lady Felicia is carrying her paints and canvas, looking for a good vantage point to set up. She hears moaning and stops to listen. A drop of blood falls on her cheek. She looks up in horror, to see a near-unconscious man hung up on the tree limbs. It's apparent he was pushed from a train traveling on the raised train tracks. Father Brown can't investigate right away, though, because he has to meet that same train when it pulls into Kembleford. Father Frank is visiting from Germany, and will give the guest sermon at a special ""Mass For Peace"". This brings its own set of problems, as anti-German feelings still run high.
....Episode 5. ""The Eye of Apollo"" New renters have moved onto the Kentford estate. Phamplets turn up all over the village - The Church of Apollo is holding a welcoming service. ""Happiness and Healing Can Be Yours"". Father Brown, always willing to listen, shows up. It might be bunco. It might be religion. But to someone who lost her family in the war, the founder, Kalon's, message sounds like salvation from grief. What if he is after more than her soul?
....Episode 6. ""The Bride of Christ"" The St Agnes Convent holds a service for Sister Mary Magdalen to take her vows as a nun. As the Order's Chaplin, Father Brown stands at the alter to officiate. Unfortunately, the Sister collapses in front of the alter and dies of a dose of cyanide. Behind the scenes, the vitriolic Novice Mistress tells the Reverend Mother, ""I didn't come all the way from India to find myself subordinate to my spiritual and moral inferior.""  Why couldn't SHE be the one knocked off, you'll be uncharitably thinking.
Father Brown finds a like-minded detective in the form of Sister Boniface, the abbey's vintner. This was a favorite episode, and it would be nice to see the amiable Sister Boniface as a recurring character. This episode has a take on a Magdalene Laundry, the last of which wasn't closed until 1996 in real life.
....Episode 7. ""The Devil's Dust"" Mrs. Bennett and Ruth, her 14 year-old daughter, walk through the village and are shunned. Mrs. McCarthy tells Father Brown, ""She has the atomic bomb sickness. You must keep away."" Mr. Bennett works in atomic physics and is persuaded by Father Brown to give a speech at the next meeting of the Kembleford Atomic Emergency Committee meeting, hoping to allay the villagers' fears. It backfires big time, and it's made worse when Ruth disappears. Right before her blood-stained pajamas are found in the trash.
....Episode 8. ""The Face of Death"" A telephone wakes Lady Margaret from a recurring nightmare. She's driving her car on a narrow road, rounds a corner, and barrels into an elderly man on the side. She answers the phone and an agitated sodden voice says, ""He's dead. Listen. He's DEAD."" Turns out it wasn't a dream, but a memory. She did run over a man, and his son, Daniel, is sure she did it on purpose. The son whose father left him a sword.
....Episode 9. ""The Mayor and the Magician"" The brand new mayor, William Knight, is going to give his first official speech at the Kembleford Annual Village Fete. It's soon clear that without his wife's speech-writing skills, he is not speaker material. But is that enough reason to electrocute him? And where did that magician come from? The one nobody remembers booking?
....Episode 10. ""The Blue Cross"" It's late at night, and Father Brown relaxes at the presbytery, giggling and guffawing at a radio show. He sees something drop through the letter box - most unusual for that hour. He opens the letter to read:
""To Catch a Thief
Look to the Cross""
He hurries over to St. Mary's, and is relieved to see that the church's venerated relic, the Blue Cross, is still in it's place. However, next to it is a calling card, a white handkerchief embroidered with an ""F"". Valentine and the Bishop arrive the next day. The cross has to be moved to a safer location, because ""F"" stands for Flambeau, ""wanted across Europe for the purloining of priceless artifacts."" And he has thrown down a challenge - Stop me if you can!
This was my 2nd favorite episode, even though it has a little more philosophizing and a bit of melodrama to boot. Keep your eye on the box!
Trivia: Alec Guinness starred as Father Brown in the B&W 1954 movie, ""The Detective"". I have it on VHS, and its version of Flambeau is almost better (though a little long).

Bonus Extra, ""Confessions From the Cotswolds"".(13 minutes) This is an enjoyable look behind-the-scenes. Commentators include Ceri Meyrick (producer), Dominic Keavey (director), Mark Williams (plays Father Brown), John Yorke (executive producer), Sorcha Cusack (plays Mrs. McCarthy), Tahsin Guner (writer), Hugo Speer (plays Detective Valentine), Nancy Carroll (plays Lady Felicia), Kasia Koleczek (plays Susie) and Alex Price (plays Sid).
Yorke says, ""What we've taken from Chesterton is the character of Father Brown. Which is, he's less interested in criminal punishment then to moral atonement, if you like. He seeks goodness.""
They did, however, update Chesterson's ""essentially Victorian"" character to the 50's.

Five of the episodes are based on Father Brown stories, and 5 are original screenplays. Have some fun and try to pick out which episodes are from original stories.

Gilbert Keith Chesterton wrote fifty-one short stories in the early twentieth century. Father Ignatius Brown is a parish priest and also an amateur detective whose observations and psychological insights are used to unravel mysteries. Chesterton was a master of paradox (truth standing on its head to attract attention) with his witty stories. He was inspired by a remark about priests, where auricular confessions can reveal many crimes to a parish priest who learns about the sins of people. Fr. Brown is a most unlikely detective compared to other detectives of fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe, Hercule Poirot, etc.). These stories are taken from the five volumes of short stories.

Disk 1.
1) The Hammer of God. A Colonel is brutally murdered in a manner where there are no likely suspects. Fr. Brown solves the crime.
2) The Oracle of the Dog. After he decides to change his will a Colonel is killed. The family dog helps Fr. Brown to identify the murderer.
3) The Curse of the Golden Cross. When an archeologist is threatened, who did it? Fr. Brown uses his knowledge of medieval history to solve the mystery.
4) The Eye of Apollo. A woman suffers from following the leader of a pagan cult. Fr. Brown investigates.

Disk 2.
5) The Three Tools of Death. A philanthropist is murdered but not by any of the three weapons found nearby. There is a confession, but Fr. Brown decides if it is true.
6) The Mirror of the Magistrate. A man makes news by exposing German spies in London, then is found shot. Fr. Brown exonerates the prime suspect.
7) The Dagger With Wings. A father and his sons suffer from strange deaths. Fr. Brown meets a Satanist who spreads fear in a troubled family.",1526774400,,1727,4.75
