3090273,5,B0012IX3CQ,"The Giants may not have been perfect during the regular season but they were in the playoffs with one exciting win after another, each being more spectacular than the previous one!  The Patriots came into the game forgetting the one big rule in most team sports that great defense will always beat a great offense!

The Giants grew as a team during the season and learned from each game.  Having lost to Dallas, Green Bay and New England, they made adjustments to compensate for those loses and as rookie players began to shine, the Giants morphed into a team of destiny winning the most exciting Super Bowl ever!  A must have for any Giants fan.",1202947200,16,646,4.591304347826087

3090275,5,B0012IX3CQ,"The Giants shocked almost everyone - even their fans! The most amazing season ever!! Beating the cheating, sore-losing, swaggering Pats was justice in a world without a lot of justice sometimes. After beating Dallas, I was a very content fan (TO crying was an awesomely great image). That alone made for a very successful season. Going on the beat the Pats and prevent their ""perfect"" year - that is one of the greatest events in all of sports. Everyone should buy this no matter what team they support just to see the guts and teamwork it took for them to win.",1202774400,25,561,4.564356435643564

3090295,4,B0012IX3CQ,"First, let me identify myself as a Giants fan.  But I am also a Football fan and love the game.

This DVD is an EXCELLENT film for the NFL FILMS franchise.  You know what I mean... Growing up we saw these on Sat and Sun mornings.  The hits with the voice over and story of the game in highlights.  They were mesmerizing and we loved them.  They were GREAT! Now as I'm older and they only show these films rarely, I enjoy watching them on DVD.

So here is the critique... I lived through this season as did most Giants fans.  This film takes you through the paces the Giants went through, but it's very slanted.  Like every other Film about Superbowl champions.  ""Over come adversity, injuries and controversy of some type.""  I cringe if this is the only record my kids will have about this season.

This season was like NO OTHER.  Tom Brady came out possessed and the Patriots ROLLED over opponents.  Remember when they could have held up as they we winning by 20 plus points and still ran up the score against opponents (more than once).  No mention about the dismissal of the the Giants (a WILD Card team) as a fluke.  Their 10 game Road Win streak is mentioned just once.  The media barely noticing the Giants is not remembered (Everything was about the possible 19-0 season of the Patriots.)  Hell, I was cheering for the Patriots until the Giants won the NFC against the Packers.  Nothing about the victory prediction by Plaxico and Brady's smug ""Really?  He thinks that does he?"" comment.

I love the film, but it is very not realistic in it's portrayal of the Giants as a Very Good Team that just finished correctly.  Have to be REAL and say it like it was... They were GOOD and PEAKED at the right moment.  The small under stories that made this a CRAZY unbelievable victory!  Hence, only 4 star.  When I watch it again with my kids as they are older, I am going to have to pause a bunch of times and say... ""And also this... And this... Now let's hit play and continue the DVD.""",1365379200,,1987,4.3780821917808215

3090301,1,B0012IX3CQ,"I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

3090302,1,B0012IX3CQ,"This is a poorly produced video. All it shows is snippets from the games without providing any context or drama. This was a magical season and deserves a lot better.

One example was the second Dallas game. They simply show the blocked kick without showing any of the tension surrounding it: the final Dallas drive or the time out to ice the kicker.

In many games they praise how well the defense and offence are playing and then we see the score and the Giants are behind.

The score is also where they don't provide enough context. They hardly ever discuss what the score is except if it happens to be on the video cut or a game announcer mentions it.

BTW I have no problem with this being a highlights DVD. But years from now when the season isn't a fresh in my mind I won't know the significance of these video clips. I wish they had spent an hour or two actually 'providing value'",1331510400,,887,4.325301204819277

A five DVD set, it has the FOX broadcast of all four complete post-season playoff games, plus the Week 17 regular season game against the Pats as a bonus.

This ""America's Game"" complements the ""Road to"" pretty well cause that set has only the complete games without any pregame or postgame commentary or analysis.",1299369600,,496,4.625

3090317,3,B0012IX3CQ,"I'm a huge Giant fan and I was a bit disappointed.  Most of the DVD showed clips prior to the Superbowl.  The lead up builds on the game, but more should/could have been shown of the actual game.
All in all it was good to watch my favorite team at one of their best moments, just wish their had been more time dedicated to the ""big"" game itself.",1270598400,,345,4.0588235294117645

It captures the roller coaster year, the questions, the concerns, and the final, magical drive from the ""moral victory"" loss to New England in the season's final game to the incredible finish.  Fans will relive the tough victory over the hated Cowboys, the overtime win on the Frozen Tundra of Lambeau Field, and the final, unbelievable, never-to-be-forgotten comeback Super Bowl triumph.  New York Giant followers will once again relive the deathless words, ""Manning back...lofts one for Burress...alone....Touchdown New York!!

3090320,5,B0012IX3CQ,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary and remembering the Giants Road Warriors win the Superbowl. The film covers the highlights of all the games right through the season and has interviews with key players and coaches. It's great to see how the second half turnaround against the Redskins in week 3 transformed the season from almost being an 0-3 start and Tom Coughlin being fired, to being the biggest underdog shock winners of the Superbowl that I can remember.
The playoff wins against Dallas and Green Bay get some extra coverage and although there isn't that much of the Superbowl, all the best parts are there. After all, not much happened in the big game until the fourth quarter, but Plaxico Burress's catch for the winning score still sends a shiver down my spine. And I still think Eli Manning is going to get sacked before he completes his miraculous pass to David Tyree.
A great trip down memory lane.",1246406400,,920,4.75625
3090321,5,B0012IX3CQ,"First things first-- please know what you're getting.  This DVD does NOT include the complete Superbowl.  If you want to see the full game, there are other DVDs that offer that.  The name of the DVD has caused a bit of confusion, but note that this DVD is actually called ""Superbowl XLII Champions: NY"". It is not called ""NFL Super Bowl XLII - New York Giants Championship"", despite how Amazon has it listed.

I can't fault the DVD because of a mistake made by Amazon, and most of the 1 star reviews you see on this site are doing exactly that.

This is a GREAT retrospective on an amazing season of football for the NY Giants.  If you like the Giants at all, watching this DVD is genuinely uplifting, dramatic and emotional.  This ranks up there among the best ""feel good"" movies I've ever seen, even if it's not technically a movie.  The presentation is excellent, with a perfect mix of game highlights, sideline banter,  drama and welcome touches of humor.  The main documentary starts with a very brief segment about the disappointing end of the 2006 season, and then proceeds through all of the 2007 season, game by game.  No, you don't get to see the full games, but rather the main highlights from each game-- all brilliantly shown in dramatic ways that capture the excitement beyond what a live broadcast can do, without ever getting distracting.  Some of the regular season games are kind of rushed, I suppose, but overall, it felt perfectly sufficient to me.  I think having TOO much detail for some of the less important games would just drag things down.  By the time the documentary reaches the playoff games, things get a bit more in-depth, and the Superbowl game itself gets the most in-depth coverage of all (but again, it is just a summary, not the full game.)

There are several full game broadcasts included as bonus features, along with the Superbowl half-time show, and interviews/profiles of key players.

Bottom line-- If you were at all taken with the Giants' unlikely championship win, this is a great DVD to remember it all by.  I watched it again last night, and it still grips me in a way that few sports documentaries can.  Please just know that you are not getting the full Superbowl.",1240272000,,2214,4.647814910025707

3090323,4,B0012IX3CQ,"Big Blue fans will enjoy this DVD of the amazing 2007-08 run-up to Super Bowl 42.  I deducted one star due to the short shrift given the playoff games.  While I can see the few minutes devoted to each regular season game, important playoff games like Green Bay don't get much more coverage than a regular season game!  I guess the expanded addition DVD may be a better buy as this product will only satisfy casual fans.  Anyway, fast delivery from Amazon (< 5 days) as usual.",1231632000,,475,4.425287356321839

3090375,4,B0012IX3CQ,"The New York Giants Championship DVD is a near perfect encapsulation of the 2007 season.  Every game is covered in near perfect detail.  The Super Bowl, including the famous ""Slip and Grip"" play of Manning to Tyree on the winning drive, is especially well covered.  That particular play cannot be seen enough.  The post-game coverage and interviews from the NFL Network telecast are nice additions to the DVD package.  They help to re-experience the feel of the post-Super Bowl euphoria.

As I said, the DVD is nearly perfect.  If there is one small critique, it has to do with the December 9th game against the Eagles in Philadelphia.  The game was decided on a last second Eagles' missed field goal attempt.  Every reaction of the play is well documented from both teams' perspective: the reaction of the players on the field and on the sidelines let you know how the kick went.  The only thing not shown is the actual play of the ball and the goalpost.  Did it miss left, right?  Was it short?  Unless you remember the game you won't know because the play is not shown!

3090384,5,B0012IX3CQ,"Bottom line- This is the only DVD out there on the Giants season that I'm aware of, so I would highly reccommend you buy it. In fact, get two and give one to your closest Cowboy fan.

It certainly could be a lot better but after watching it before bed, I was pumped up enough that I couldn't fall asleep for two hours.

It gives you a couple of minutes of each regular season game, then the playoffs and finally the Superbowl. Not a lot of coverage on any game - even the Superbowl.  It is produced for fans of Big Blue.  The Giants look good even in the games they lost. They use Bob Pappa and Carl Banks mixed in with the normal ""NFL"" voice over.  It also has some great camera shots.  The video quality is top notch.

So yes, I wish it had more of the games, but then again I wish men's magazines had more pages of pictures. This disc does contain the Tom Petty halftime show - why? I would have prefered to see the whole final drive of the Superbowl (It does contain Jacobs forth down run and, of course, Tyree's catch!)It has footage of media day and the post game NFL Network show too.

I'm glad I bought it.  I will watch it over and over I'm sure. If you love Big Blue, buy it too. It's not perfect, but you will enjoy it.",1204502400,7,1230,4.070539419087137
3090385,4,B0012IX3CQ,"As a lifelong Giant fan I am glad I bought the dvd but I am extremely disappointed in the lack of footage of the Super Bowl game itself.  The Super Bowl was the greatest game of the season. It was better than the Giant Super Bowl victories in 1986 and 1990 and is one of, if not the greatest, Super Bowls ever played.

This dvd has segments on all the games played during the season as well as all the playoff games. In addition two of the extras include a game of the week segment on the playoff games against Dallas and Green Bay but no game of the week for the Super Bowl.

I would have gladly done away with all the extras to have a full half hour or hour on the actual plays of the Super Bowl. My dvd player showed the section with the game coverage of the Super Bowl lasting approximately fifteen minutes. There were extra segments commenting on the game but I wanted to see more of the game.

Part of the Super Bowl game coverage shows the game officials commenting on the game. This is nice but considering the time devoted to the Super Bowl it takes away from the actual game coverage.

The dvd showed only five plays of the Giant's game winning drive. The plays are as follows: a near interception by New England, the fourth down conversion by the Giants that kept the drive alive, a brief clip of a sack of Manning, the amazing pass by Manning to Tyree and the final pass to Burress.

The dvd then has extras including the half time show, post game interviews and analysis and segments on Manning, Coughlin, Kiwanuka and Strahan. All this is nice but I want to see more of one of the greatest Super Bowls ever.

I heard that a dvd focusing on the Super Bowl may come out later in the year. I don't know if this is true. I hope it is. I will buy it in a second.

(I just purchased the Giants' Road to the Superbowl dvd. It was worth the wait. It has the all the Giants' playoff games as well as the last game against New England. It has the complete games. The two dvd's go perfect together.)

This dvd is a nice reminder of the season. If you are a Giant's fan I would definitely buy it. Still, I wish the dvd had more game coverage of the Super Bowl.",1204329600,27,2162,4.15311004784689

Another extra is NFL Network's Post Game show at the Super Bowl. If you're a Giants' fan, ignore the bad reviews here and just buy it!",1204329600,9,578,4.361111111111111

They have had either the international feed of play by play or as in the case of the Tampa Bay Bucs, they used the Radio calls of the teams along with the actual video.

2 minor gripes with the FILM, not the DVD.

1) The Eagles game that came down to a field goal miss wasn't shown.  I mean, the game was there but the video shows the sideline's reaction to the miss not the actual football.  I found that to be odd.

2) The wonderful run from BRADSHAW wasn't shown to the full extent.  I remember watching that play and how the ""N"" from his helmet came off and I thought that would of made a good 30 seconds or so talking about how funny it was.

Besides those 2 little complaints, it is a great Buy.  I've been a Giants fan since birth and it was a great season and they truly played like a TEAM, no super stars running the show, the way a sport should be!",1204243200,10,813,4.069182389937107
3090399,5,B0012IX3CQ,"Got this DVD as a gift and enjoyed seeing highlights of the 2008 ""Road Warriors"" season.  Having followed the Giants more closely, this year, it was still amazing to relive it again with this DVD.  Many years ago, when I was in college, I was lucky to spend a few summers at the Cleveland Browns training camp.  Seeing these guys eating raw steak in the cafeteria, play scrimmage, and hangout during some downtime moments, etc., gave me an appreciation of the rigors of training, competition and skill involved in the process.  Just having to bring together a diverse group of talented athletes, (some who will make the grade and some who will be cut) to eventually become ""a team"", is a truly amazing process.  The comments by Giants players and staff in this DVD give you a sense how intense their jobs are and how incredible their season and Super Bowl victory was.  I also enjoyed the additional material, but wished they would have had some real footage on the celebration parade back in New York that the team and the fans seemed to really enjoy.  Being a lifelong Giant fan, yes, I personally would like to have a complete DVD collection of every single game they played in 2008.  Go figure, it's a souvenir!",1204156800,7,1215,4.618604651162791

3090402,3,B0012IX3CQ,"Based on the title of the DVD, I was expecting a little more Superbowl coverage.

3090403,4,B0012IX3CQ,"Okay, so it's pretty clear that few if any of the other reviewers have actually watched this thing. I preordered in the days after the Super Bowl and literally just got it today. I watched most of it, and since no one else has offered a real review, I figured it would be helpful to fellow Giants fans if I shared my impressions.

The short version? Overall, it's friggin sweet. Be forewarned, this does NOT contain any full games - I knew that when I bought it. But it does contain pretty extensive highlights and retrospectives of the season and the big game. Let's face it, you're probably buying this because you want to re-live some of those great moments from this unbelievable season down the road. This should pretty much satisfy that.

The real meat is, of course, the main featurette, which is your typical NFL Films recap of the season. I have to say, I really enjoyed it, as it's very well done. It runs about 75 minutes start-to-finish, including some preseason stuff and an overview and highlights from each game. It has most of the big plays/memorable moments from the year, (i.e. the dramatic goal-line stand against the 'Skins in Week 3). The final 20 minutes focus solely on the Super Bowl, and that's one of my minor complaints. I would have liked a bit more on the big game, but it's very well put together regardless. I got the chills watching the multiple angles of Eli's Great Escape in the fourth quarter. Thankfully, no Joe Buck.

The rest includes a mixed bag: Two 20-minute chapters about the playoff games against Dallas and Green Bay (both good); post-Super Bowl coverage and interviews from NFL Network (some fun stuff there); Media Day highlights (eh), the Super Bowl halftime show (I like Tom Petty and all, but I doubt I will ever watch this); and a quartet of ten-minute profiles: Strahan, Coughlin, Eli, and Kiwanuka.

So, there you have it. Overall, I'm glad I picked it up, as it's a nice way to revisit the season. I could have gone with a little more game footage and fewer extras, but what are ya gonna do. I imagine you can buy the complete Super Bowl uncut somewhere, if that's more what you're looking for...?

Oh yeah, one more thing: I REALLY wish they had included footage of Tom Brady laughing about Plaxico's ""17 points"" prediction. Hey Tom: you done got punched in the mouth.",1203897600,181,2324,4.603864734299517
3090404,5,B0012IX3CQ,"I am a Rams fan, but I will be buying this to go along with my spiffy new NY Giants ballcap.  This was arguably the greatest upset in sports history because of all the surrounding stories.  From Spygate to Brady's love life, to an aging superstar (Strahan), to Belichick's lack of respect for the game (leaving the field early), to all the scenarios revolving around a possible perfect season, it was a perfect storm of hype and drama.  And oh by the way, the game was one of the best Superbowls ever played.  Seriously, does anyone outside of Boston even remotely like the pretentious Patriots?  The Giants won the game for all of us, New York fan or not, and I will always appreciate this accomplishment.  Thank you, G-Men!",1203379200,19,725,4.5813953488372094
3090405,5,B0012IX3CQ,"I'm not even a Giants fan but I would buy this DVD just to see alternate coverage of the defeat of the Patriots.  The Patriots franchise is a disgrace.  The fumble in the snow against the Raiders, the holding against the Rams in the Super Bowl, the cheating for years, the arrogance, the poor sportsmanship by their coach, BARELY winning each Super Bowl...yet, they're considered a DYNASTY.  Tom Brady has had the luxury of having the best offensive line in football for practically his entire career.  He was badly exposed and humbled against the Giants.  For every NFL fan who was about ready to puke every time they acknowledged Brady as the best ever, for every fan who had to listen to the talk about the 2007 Patriots being the best team ever, BOY, IS THIS DVD FOR YOU!  The Patriots finally got what was coming to them.  Unfortunately, they can't strip away all of their other Super Bowl titles in which they cheated.  And too bad the evidence was thrown out so quickly.  By the way, it was also a great victory over Favre in the NFC Championship.  He is another overrated QB who, if you think about it, other than being blessed to never be injured, really has done nothing in a decade.  Well, he IS the all-time interception leader.

3324792,4,B0012IX3CQ,"First, let me identify myself as a Giants fan.  But I am also a Football fan and love the game.

This DVD is an EXCELLENT film for the NFL FILMS franchise.  You know what I mean... Growing up we saw these on Sat and Sun mornings.  The hits with the voice over and story of the game in highlights.  They were mesmerizing and we loved them.  They were GREAT! Now as I'm older and they only show these films rarely, I enjoy watching them on DVD.

So here is the critique... I lived through this season as did most Giants fans.  This film takes you through the paces the Giants went through, but it's very slanted.  Like every other Film about Superbowl champions.  ""Over come adversity, injuries and controversy of some type.""  I cringe if this is the only record my kids will have about this season.

This season was like NO OTHER.  Tom Brady came out possessed and the Patriots ROLLED over opponents.  Remember when they could have held up as they we winning by 20 plus points and still ran up the score against opponents (more than once).  No mention about the dismissal of the the Giants (a WILD Card team) as a fluke.  Their 10 game Road Win streak is mentioned just once.  The media barely noticing the Giants is not remembered (Everything was about the possible 19-0 season of the Patriots.)  Hell, I was cheering for the Patriots until the Giants won the NFC against the Packers.  Nothing about the victory prediction by Plaxico and Brady's smug ""Really?  He thinks that does he?"" comment.

I love the film, but it is very not realistic in it's portrayal of the Giants as a Very Good Team that just finished correctly.  Have to be REAL and say it like it was... They were GOOD and PEAKED at the right moment.  The small under stories that made this a CRAZY unbelievable victory!  Hence, only 4 star.  When I watch it again with my kids as they are older, I am going to have to pause a bunch of times and say... ""And also this... And this... Now let's hit play and continue the DVD.""",1365379200,,1987,4.3780821917808215

Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about?  Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.

3324799,1,B0012IX3CQ,"This is a poorly produced video. All it shows is snippets from the games without providing any context or drama. This was a magical season and deserves a lot better.

One example was the second Dallas game. They simply show the blocked kick without showing any of the tension surrounding it: the final Dallas drive or the time out to ice the kicker.

In many games they praise how well the defense and offence are playing and then we see the score and the Giants are behind.

The score is also where they don't provide enough context. They hardly ever discuss what the score is except if it happens to be on the video cut or a game announcer mentions it.

BTW I have no problem with this being a highlights DVD. But years from now when the season isn't a fresh in my mind I won't know the significance of these video clips. I wish they had spent an hour or two actually 'providing value'",1331510400,,887,4.325301204819277

3324817,5,B0012IX3CQ,"I really enjoyed watching this documentary and remembering the Giants Road Warriors win the Superbowl. The film covers the highlights of all the games right through the season and has interviews with key players and coaches. It's great to see how the second half turnaround against the Redskins in week 3 transformed the season from almost being an 0-3 start and Tom Coughlin being fired, to being the biggest underdog shock winners of the Superbowl that I can remember.
The playoff wins against Dallas and Green Bay get some extra coverage and although there isn't that much of the Superbowl, all the best parts are there. After all, not much happened in the big game until the fourth quarter, but Plaxico Burress's catch for the winning score still sends a shiver down my spine. And I still think Eli Manning is going to get sacked before he completes his miraculous pass to David Tyree.
A great trip down memory lane.",1246406400,,920,4.75625
3324818,5,B0012IX3CQ,"First things first-- please know what you're getting.  This DVD does NOT include the complete Superbowl.  If you want to see the full game, there are other DVDs that offer that.  The name of the DVD has caused a bit of confusion, but note that this DVD is actually called ""Superbowl XLII Champions: NY"". It is not called ""NFL Super Bowl XLII - New York Giants Championship"", despite how Amazon has it listed.

I can't fault the DVD because of a mistake made by Amazon, and most of the 1 star reviews you see on this site are doing exactly that.

This is a GREAT retrospective on an amazing season of football for the NY Giants.  If you like the Giants at all, watching this DVD is genuinely uplifting, dramatic and emotional.  This ranks up there among the best ""feel good"" movies I've ever seen, even if it's not technically a movie.  The presentation is excellent, with a perfect mix of game highlights, sideline banter,  drama and welcome touches of humor.  The main documentary starts with a very brief segment about the disappointing end of the 2006 season, and then proceeds through all of the 2007 season, game by game.  No, you don't get to see the full games, but rather the main highlights from each game-- all brilliantly shown in dramatic ways that capture the excitement beyond what a live broadcast can do, without ever getting distracting.  Some of the regular season games are kind of rushed, I suppose, but overall, it felt perfectly sufficient to me.  I think having TOO much detail for some of the less important games would just drag things down.  By the time the documentary reaches the playoff games, things get a bit more in-depth, and the Superbowl game itself gets the most in-depth coverage of all (but again, it is just a summary, not the full game.)

There are several full game broadcasts included as bonus features, along with the Superbowl half-time show, and interviews/profiles of key players.

Bottom line-- If you were at all taken with the Giants' unlikely championship win, this is a great DVD to remember it all by.  I watched it again last night, and it still grips me in a way that few sports documentaries can.  Please just know that you are not getting the full Superbowl.",1240272000,,2214,4.647814910025707

3324872,4,B0012IX3CQ,"The New York Giants Championship DVD is a near perfect encapsulation of the 2007 season.  Every game is covered in near perfect detail.  The Super Bowl, including the famous ""Slip and Grip"" play of Manning to Tyree on the winning drive, is especially well covered.  That particular play cannot be seen enough.  The post-game coverage and interviews from the NFL Network telecast are nice additions to the DVD package.  They help to re-experience the feel of the post-Super Bowl euphoria.

As I said, the DVD is nearly perfect.  If there is one small critique, it has to do with the December 9th game against the Eagles in Philadelphia.  The game was decided on a last second Eagles' missed field goal attempt.  Every reaction of the play is well documented from both teams' perspective: the reaction of the players on the field and on the sidelines let you know how the kick went.  The only thing not shown is the actual play of the ball and the goalpost.  Did it miss left, right?  Was it short?  Unless you remember the game you won't know because the play is not shown!

3324881,5,B0012IX3CQ,"Bottom line- This is the only DVD out there on the Giants season that I'm aware of, so I would highly reccommend you buy it. In fact, get two and give one to your closest Cowboy fan.

It certainly could be a lot better but after watching it before bed, I was pumped up enough that I couldn't fall asleep for two hours.

It gives you a couple of minutes of each regular season game, then the playoffs and finally the Superbowl. Not a lot of coverage on any game - even the Superbowl.  It is produced for fans of Big Blue.  The Giants look good even in the games they lost. They use Bob Pappa and Carl Banks mixed in with the normal ""NFL"" voice over.  It also has some great camera shots.  The video quality is top notch.

So yes, I wish it had more of the games, but then again I wish men's magazines had more pages of pictures. This disc does contain the Tom Petty halftime show - why? I would have prefered to see the whole final drive of the Superbowl (It does contain Jacobs forth down run and, of course, Tyree's catch!)It has footage of media day and the post game NFL Network show too.

I'm glad I bought it.  I will watch it over and over I'm sure. If you love Big Blue, buy it too. It's not perfect, but you will enjoy it.",1204502400,7,1230,4.070539419087137
3324882,4,B0012IX3CQ,"As a lifelong Giant fan I am glad I bought the dvd but I am extremely disappointed in the lack of footage of the Super Bowl game itself.  The Super Bowl was the greatest game of the season. It was better than the Giant Super Bowl victories in 1986 and 1990 and is one of, if not the greatest, Super Bowls ever played.

This dvd has segments on all the games played during the season as well as all the playoff games. In addition two of the extras include a game of the week segment on the playoff games against Dallas and Green Bay but no game of the week for the Super Bowl.

I would have gladly done away with all the extras to have a full half hour or hour on the actual plays of the Super Bowl. My dvd player showed the section with the game coverage of the Super Bowl lasting approximately fifteen minutes. There were extra segments commenting on the game but I wanted to see more of the game.

Part of the Super Bowl game coverage shows the game officials commenting on the game. This is nice but considering the time devoted to the Super Bowl it takes away from the actual game coverage.

The dvd showed only five plays of the Giant's game winning drive. The plays are as follows: a near interception by New England, the fourth down conversion by the Giants that kept the drive alive, a brief clip of a sack of Manning, the amazing pass by Manning to Tyree and the final pass to Burress.

The dvd then has extras including the half time show, post game interviews and analysis and segments on Manning, Coughlin, Kiwanuka and Strahan. All this is nice but I want to see more of one of the greatest Super Bowls ever.

I heard that a dvd focusing on the Super Bowl may come out later in the year. I don't know if this is true. I hope it is. I will buy it in a second.

(I just purchased the Giants' Road to the Superbowl dvd. It was worth the wait. It has the all the Giants' playoff games as well as the last game against New England. It has the complete games. The two dvd's go perfect together.)

This dvd is a nice reminder of the season. If you are a Giant's fan I would definitely buy it. Still, I wish the dvd had more game coverage of the Super Bowl.",1204329600,27,2162,4.15311004784689

1) The Eagles game that came down to a field goal miss wasn't shown.  I mean, the game was there but the video shows the sideline's reaction to the miss not the actual football.  I found that to be odd.

2) The wonderful run from BRADSHAW wasn't shown to the full extent.  I remember watching that play and how the ""N"" from his helmet came off and I thought that would of made a good 30 seconds or so talking about how funny it was.

Besides those 2 little complaints, it is a great Buy.  I've been a Giants fan since birth and it was a great season and they truly played like a TEAM, no super stars running the show, the way a sport should be!",1204243200,10,813,4.069182389937107
3324896,5,B0012IX3CQ,"Got this DVD as a gift and enjoyed seeing highlights of the 2008 ""Road Warriors"" season.  Having followed the Giants more closely, this year, it was still amazing to relive it again with this DVD.  Many years ago, when I was in college, I was lucky to spend a few summers at the Cleveland Browns training camp.  Seeing these guys eating raw steak in the cafeteria, play scrimmage, and hangout during some downtime moments, etc., gave me an appreciation of the rigors of training, competition and skill involved in the process.  Just having to bring together a diverse group of talented athletes, (some who will make the grade and some who will be cut) to eventually become ""a team"", is a truly amazing process.  The comments by Giants players and staff in this DVD give you a sense how intense their jobs are and how incredible their season and Super Bowl victory was.  I also enjoyed the additional material, but wished they would have had some real footage on the celebration parade back in New York that the team and the fans seemed to really enjoy.  Being a lifelong Giant fan, yes, I personally would like to have a complete DVD collection of every single game they played in 2008.  Go figure, it's a souvenir!",1204156800,7,1215,4.618604651162791
3324897,5,B0012IX3CQ,"Its not really the Super Bowl, its a review of the entire Giants season. Only 20 Mins are dedicated to the Super Bowl.

But if you a Giants Fan, this is must watch, one of the greatest DVD's ever. Video from the Low point of the first 2 losses to the Road Warrior Giants. I still feel cold watching the Packers game.

Great extra features Super Bowl Post Game show. Super Bowl Half-Time show (Running Down the Dream-The Giants unofficial theme song)

Interviews with Coughlin, Strahan and Eli Manning",1204070400,2,500,4.595505617977528
3324898,5,B0012IX3CQ,"Get your popcorn ready! A must have for the true New York Giant fan, stocked with highlights from the 2007 season as well as many bonus features. I liked the profile on Tom Coughlin done by NFL films in 2005 you get the NFL Networks post game show of the Super Bowl with all the interviews as well as the great footage only NFL films have access to. Well done!! buy it now for yourself and play it on the big screen well worth the $20 bucks indeed.",1203984000,2,448,4.1022727272727275
3324899,3,B0012IX3CQ,"Based on the title of the DVD, I was expecting a little more Superbowl coverage. The DVD basically gives highlights of ALL the Giant's games throughout the season, not just the Superbowl... only the last chapter covers the win over the Patriots.",1203984000,5,245,4.857142857142857
3324900,4,B0012IX3CQ,"Okay, so it's pretty clear that few if any of the other reviewers have actually watched this thing. I preordered in the days after the Super Bowl and literally just got it today. I watched most of it, and since no one else has offered a real review, I figured it would be helpful to fellow Giants fans if I shared my impressions.

The short version? Overall, it's friggin sweet. Be forewarned, this does NOT contain any full games - I knew that when I bought it. But it does contain pretty extensive highlights and retrospectives of the season and the big game. Let's face it, you're probably buying this because you want to re-live some of those great moments from this unbelievable season down the road. This should pretty much satisfy that.

The real meat is, of course, the main featurette, which is your typical NFL Films recap of the season. I have to say, I really enjoyed it, as it's very well done. It runs about 75 minutes start-to-finish, including some preseason stuff and an overview and highlights from each game. It has most of the big plays/memorable moments from the year, (i.e. the dramatic goal-line stand against the 'Skins in Week 3). The final 20 minutes focus solely on the Super Bowl, and that's one of my minor complaints. I would have liked a bit more on the big game, but it's very well put together regardless. I got the chills watching the multiple angles of Eli's Great Escape in the fourth quarter. Thankfully, no Joe Buck.

The rest includes a mixed bag: Two 20-minute chapters about the playoff games against Dallas and Green Bay (both good); post-Super Bowl coverage and interviews from NFL Network (some fun stuff there); Media Day highlights (eh), the Super Bowl halftime show (I like Tom Petty and all, but I doubt I will ever watch this); and a quartet of ten-minute profiles: Strahan, Coughlin, Eli, and Kiwanuka.

So, there you have it. Overall, I'm glad I picked it up, as it's a nice way to revisit the season. I could have gone with a little more game footage and fewer extras, but what are ya gonna do. I imagine you can buy the complete Super Bowl uncut somewhere, if that's more what you're looking for...?

Oh yeah, one more thing: I REALLY wish they had included footage of Tom Brady laughing about Plaxico's ""17 points"" prediction. Hey Tom: you done got punched in the mouth.",1203897600,181,2324,4.603864734299517
3324901,5,B0012IX3CQ,"I am a Rams fan, but I will be buying this to go along with my spiffy new NY Giants ballcap.  This was arguably the greatest upset in sports history because of all the surrounding stories.  From Spygate to Brady's love life, to an aging superstar (Strahan), to Belichick's lack of respect for the game (leaving the field early), to all the scenarios revolving around a possible perfect season, it was a perfect storm of hype and drama.  And oh by the way, the game was one of the best Superbowls ever played.  Seriously, does anyone outside of Boston even remotely like the pretentious Patriots?  The Giants won the game for all of us, New York fan or not, and I will always appreciate this accomplishment.  Thank you, G-Men!",1203379200,19,725,4.5813953488372094
3324902,5,B0012IX3CQ,"I'm not even a Giants fan but I would buy this DVD just to see alternate coverage of the defeat of the Patriots.  The Patriots franchise is a disgrace.  The fumble in the snow against the Raiders, the holding against the Rams in the Super Bowl, the cheating for years, the arrogance, the poor sportsmanship by their coach, BARELY winning each Super Bowl...yet, they're considered a DYNASTY.  Tom Brady has had the luxury of having the best offensive line in football for practically his entire career.  He was badly exposed and humbled against the Giants.  For every NFL fan who was about ready to puke every time they acknowledged Brady as the best ever, for every fan who had to listen to the talk about the 2007 Patriots being the best team ever, BOY, IS THIS DVD FOR YOU!  The Patriots finally got what was coming to them.  Unfortunately, they can't strip away all of their other Super Bowl titles in which they cheated.  And too bad the evidence was thrown out so quickly.  By the way, it was also a great victory over Favre in the NFC Championship.  He is another overrated QB who, if you think about it, other than being blessed to never be injured, really has done nothing in a decade.  Well, he IS the all-time interception leader.  Go Giants!",1203292800,15,1252,4.540178571428571

8246128,5,B0012IX3CQ,I just loves it because they took those amazing undefeated cheaters from Boston & jammed it down their throats!! lol Look everyone if you had a team which whom ever it maybe & they won all the time by doing everything right!! then no one should ever say anything in that regard. But if you have a team like the New England patriots that win by doing absolutely anything!!  from deflated balls having a spy for over 7 seasons & knowing what the other team is doing before they do. Needless to say that is why other people & fans of the game is so disgusted with that team. Because they cheat & everyone know it & they continue to get way with it with a slap on the wrist!! lol But not once did the New York Football Giants stick it to them they did it twice!! & on the very biggest stage ha. lol Go Giants!! & do it to them again this year lol!!!
