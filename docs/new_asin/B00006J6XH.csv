1779168,5,B00006J6XH,"I was 5 when it first aired. I so remember watching Baretta with my Dad. It was great. I cant say I understood the stories back then when I was little, but now I really do. Baretta was a tough guy but you knew that he was a softy. No matter that he hid it well. It was a must have for me. To just be able to see a show that I grew up with and enjoy it is great. And to know it was one of the two shows my father and I adored is soooo cool. Who couldn't love Tony Baretta for wanting justice against the drug dealers and the mob.",1046995200,7,528,3.6403508771929824
1779169,5,B00006J6XH,"BARETTA occupies one of a trilogy of slots for the most enjoyable television dramas of the 1970's (the other two being KUNG FU and KOJAK, with STARKSY AND HUTCH a close runner up).  It just doesn't get much better than this.  The funky dialogue is what really shines here -that, and the quirky sideshow characters like Rooster (Baretta's mack daddy man on the street) and The Soup Lady (this half-crazy old woman who lives downstairs and is forever fixing Tony and Billy soup).  BARETTA epitomizes the tough streetwise guy with the rapid fire tongue and out there sayings that has seen a resurgence most recently in the scripts of Quentin Tarantino.  What really struck me was the depth of characterization which I never noticed watching this as a kid.  There is a backstory which subtley weaves its way into each episode.  From various hints, including the sea paraphenalia on the walls of his apartment and the presence of his lovable cockatoo Fred, we learn Tony was once a merchant marine, and Bill (the old guy - am I getting his name wrong?)was friends with his father.  And there is consistency to this universe - the fiance Tony avenges in the pilot episode still remains a ghostly presence in a smiling portrait on a table in his place.  There's a host of great episodes here - my particular favorites being He'll Never See The Light Of Day, The Copelli Oath, Walk Like You Talk, and so many others.  The weakest entry is the one where Tony has to rub elbows with high society (I think its the last one).  He's so out of place and uncomfortable its laughable.  Some of Tony's disguises are a little weird, too so be warned.  But when he's on the streets in his element, Robert Blake is gold in this show.  And check out the cameos from some great 70's personas! The great Moses `Mr. Big' Gunn! Burt `Yo Paulie' Young! The mother from Poltergeist (she's in the first scene of The Mansion)! Good action, awesome dialogue, and some surprisingly hard hitting themes.  So cook up some chili dogs and chicken soup, crack open a bottle of that stuff not meant for drinking, and let de good times roll. Great Tv.  BRING ON SEASON TWO AND THREE, PARTNER!",1045785600,37,2154,4.602094240837697
1779170,5,B00006J6XH,as the opening theme song began. God I missed this show. Baretta was as close to reality as you could get regarding  TVpolice drama. A cop from the streets with a big heart. Watching it has brought back many memories of the 70's for me. And Im so happy to have this dvd collection on my shelf.....cant wait for season 2. :),1040515200,9,323,4.209677419354839

1779172,4,B00006J6XH,"Those words take on a whole new meaning considering Robert Blake's current and still on-going trial.  It doesn't seem ironic that this Season 1 DVD set of the 70s cop show that made Blake famous is being released now while he was in the news not to long ago (although media coverage is pretty much non-existent at this point).  Regardless of Blake's reality, Baretta should be looked at for what it is, an entertaining and landmark cop show that would set a blueprint for many similar shows and films to come.  Baretta ran on ABC from 1975-1978 for four seasons (82 episodes).  The show concerns NY Detective Tony Baretta (Blake) and his unusual and rule-breaking ways of catching the bad guys.  He lives alone with his pet cockatoo, Fred, and gets help from his ""man on the street"" - Rooster.  The show was created by Stephen J. Cannell who has been involved with popular shows such as Night Rider, A-Team, Adam 12, Hunter, Greatest American Hero, Wiseguy, etc. (the list goes on).  It's a safe bet that if you were into most of those shows or just love cop shows then you will probably find something to like or love about Baretta.  This 3 DVD set consists of the complete first season (12 episodes).  For casual fans, there will also be a single disc ""Best of Baretta"" released which includes episodes 1, 10, & 11 from this set. Here are the episode titles for season one:
 1. He'll Never See Daylight Again
 2. The Five and a Half Pound Junkie
 3. Woman in the Harbor
 4. If You Can't Pay the Price
 5. Half a Million Dollar Baby
 6. Ragtime Billy Peaches
 7. The Coppelli Oath
 8. Walk like you talk
 9. The Mansion
10. Keep your Eye on the Sparrow
11. The Secret of Terry Lake
12. This ain't my Bag

I'm wondering if seasons 2, 3, and 4 aren't available because the producers think they won't sell or because Robert Blake has a history.

1779241,5,B00006J6XH,"I was in my twenties when Baretta first aired on tv and I used to watch it with my dad. We both enjoyed the offbeat methods Tony used as a cop. He was tough-as-nails when he had to be; yet always fair, and ready to offer sound advice and help if he thought it would set some wayward kid straight. The other star of the show was the bird...which is interesting since it never really did anything other than act like a bird! Still, cockatoos are pretty cool and that fit Baretta's style perfectly.

When I first saw season one released I was excited! Here was my chance to buy the entire series on dvd...or so I thought. Now, I can see that it isn't likely to happen. Is it an issue of low sales? Or does the studio want to be our conscience and decide what the public should be allowed to see (because of the trial)? Either way there have been no further season releases. On the bright side, we do at least have one season to watch. Who knows...maybe someday reason will rule and the rest of the show will be made available.",1208044800,3,1023,4.219387755102041

1779243,5,B00006J6XH,"Robert Blake plays a very believable edgy cop, Tony Baretta, in the city. He drives a beat up Chevy that never seems to quit and he always gets the bad guy. Supporting actors blend well, there's good plot, action and I enjoyed that silly Cockatoo, Freddy. Especially his rooster and chicken voices. Old tv reviews claimed Blake hated that bird but you'd never know it. Blake's disguises were fun. Some more wild than others. ""Ragtime Billy Peaches"" sub character for one. Sure there was some hokey Hollywood writing but it worked. Sometimes schlocky sometimes gritty, never dull. Lt Shiller (Dana Elcar) was the first boss but soon replaced by ""Bossy-Boy"" Lt. Hal Brubaker (Ed Grover)who was wonderful and under used, Billy Truman (Tom Ewell)the old guy character that hung out at the run down pad where Tony slept, Foley (John Ward) the square but likable and sometimes partner, and who could forget Rooster (Michael D. Roberts) who played the dolled up, platform shoe kinda ""guy?""  who drove a car with wall to wall fur on the count of he needed it for his ""profession""?

1779244,5,B00006J6XH,"No matter what year were in and how much modern technology that we have today, nothing beats a good 70's cop show. I never paid too much attention to Barretta because it was really never on reruns. Plus, I was a toddler when the show was out on prime-time. I saw this on amazon and immediately it was a must have. Even though Barretta was a ficticious character, we share some similarities that I found intresting.

Both of us are little rough exteriored guys who need to stand up for ourselves to be noticed.  In my single days I lived out of pure minimalism like him and lived in a studio apartment much like his.  It even had the pull down Murphy bed. Our taste in cars were similar too, his tarnished 66 Chevy Impala was very similar to my 75 Buick Regal that just wouldn't die.

But we all know that is just a role he played. But the point is that the show felt so real that he is someone that many everyday people could relate to.  The second the show comes on with the theme music, I'm in a whole different world for a non-stop hour! That's a sign of a really good show!

1779248,4,B00006J6XH,"Only just finding out Baretta, Season One is on DVD from a Columbia House mailing, I can only review the show and the fact only season one may be released on DVD. Maybe the studio will change its mind if more become aware of the release and purchase the DVD. Meanwhile, my five videos of 35 episodes will suffice. I was looking at the title to one, That Sister Ain't No Cousin, which reminded me of Tony's habit of referring to all young women as ""cousins."" The show had so much going for it I was surprised it had such a short run. Billy, Rooster, Fred, that old Chevy, the Bronx street talk, dirt and grime. You felt like you were in NYC. And Sammy Davis, Jr. singing the title song, when they finally added words to the eerie musical track, so captured the mood of the series. While Baretta's first boss did okay, I far preferred Brubaker's attitude in dealing with this rogue cop who always managed to get his man (or woman), in his own erstwhile fashion. When a reviewer said the decision had been made not to release the remaining seasons, it reminded me of when I subscribed to Beauty and the Beast through Columbia House quite a few years ago. When the subscription ended halfway through the series' run I was told Columbia House would let me know when the rest of the run was released, only it never was. So may be the case with Baretta after only the extremely short first season. So that is why I am sooooo glad I taped the episodes I did.",1130198400,7,1450,4.334558823529412

I'm starting to balk at buying box sets from certain companies, because they're not keeping what I see as a commitment with their customers.  So, if you guys at Universal are ever checking Amazon to see if there's still an interest in having more seasons of Baretta released, your answer is oh hell YES.  I check up every month or so to see if there are new seasons of the shows I buy, and I would buy every season of Baretta if they'd just put them out.  You got me hooked with season one and then cut me off... that's not a good way to build brand loyalty, Universal.  Please stop disappointing us and release the other seasons.  If you'd do that, I would strongly recommend this show, because it's one of the best TV cop shows ever.  Thanks.",1115596800,40,902,4.333333333333333
1779251,4,B00006J6XH,"A review of the first season of Baretta should remind any viewer that Robert Blake was one the best actors anywhere. No joke!  His career never got him the fame of a Robert DiNiro, Al Pacino, or the other acting ""greats"" of the '70's but he was every bit as good or even better.

This DVD set shows Blake's ability to be completely comfortable and relaxed on screen, and to mask any trace of acting.  He's master of an acting technique that makes it look like there is no technique being used.  Perhaps Blake was aided in this by playing ""Mickey"" (his real first name) at such a young age as one of ""Our Gang"" in the 1930's (later renamed ""The Little Rascals"" for TV syndication).

""Baretta"" showcases Blake's talents well with this lead role with lots of quirks to it. The newsboy hat, the pet cockatoo, the ever-present unlit cigarette in the mouth or behind the ear by this non-smoker.

There are interesting elements to this TV character that I don't recall having been done before or since.  When's the last time you saw a TV show lead character willing to dress in filthy vagrant clothes and literally sleep on the sidewalk to stakeout a suspect across the street?  Baretta is a police detective who's so willing to look not-cool that it's the ULTIMATE cool.

This show was produced by Stephen J Cannell who also went on to do the Rockford files and there are some similarities between the two.  One interesting convention shared by the two shows is the willingness of the story to have the lead get beat up, rather than being the superhero type who always wins a fight...a conceit that was original at the time.  Also the older man as supporting character.  In Baretta it's the old manager of the resident hotel where Baretta lives in his one room apartment complete with fold-away Murphy bed.  In Rockford, it was his father who acted more like a friend. The age-mixing offers nice variety compared to today's strict TV show demographic appeals where most shows are 100% pretty young model/actors and even their parents (when they make an appearance) are under 45.  And too the main character who lives modestly.  Rockford's trailer compares to Baretta's studio apartment. And because it's the '70's it seems everyone in Baretta just by default drives a really cool muscle car, except for Baretta himself who's stuck with a P.O.S. lead-sled chevy. Oh, and anyone in organized crime who all drive Cadillacs of course.

Noticably absent here is today's strict political correctness. Characters are allowed to affectionately rib each other about their repsective cultural backgrounds, Italian, Jewish, black or whatever. Diminutive Tony Barretta is nicknamed ""midget"" a couple of times. In another instance Baretta tells his black, pimped-out street informant ""Rooster"" that there's going to be ""fried chicken and watermelon"".  Modern viewers may find this treating the viewer as an adult and lack of pandering either incredibly refreshing or offensively insensitive. Either way, it's a noticable departure from today's network TV.

The quality of the specific 12 shows in this DVD set is uneven. Some like ""The Five And A Half Pound Junkie"" and ""If You Can't Pay The Price"" are gritty and nuanced.  Others like ""This Ain't My Bag"" seem more like an episode of ""Columbo""...a generic whodunit with uninspired directing, and that has Baretta filling in as the modern day Hercule Perot instead of Peter Falk in a raincoat.  Especially so compared to innovative directing in some of the other episodes such as the interestingly shot montage scene where mobsters undress Blake and force him into bed with a woman to take compromising photos to serve as blackmail.

In general, those episodes which remove the Baretta character from his element of the streets may be more likely to disappoint but as a whole the disc set is satisfying.  In light of Blake's recent court problems, viewers might especially enjoy the indignant Baretta's climax courtroom speech to the witch hunt city commission that calls him in on suspicion of taking payoffs and dealing drugs to gain cooperation from the underworld in the episode ""Walk Like You Talk""",1112054400,12,4134,4.9094827586206895

1779253,4,B00006J6XH,"Anyone who grew up in 70s watching TV shows can not forget the amount of entertainment and enjoyment, week after week, the TV shows brought them and their families right in their living room. Several dramas of 70s are worth mentioning; Baretta, Starsky and Hutch, Rockford files, Wonder Woman, Charlie's Angels, and SWAT. Baretta is a one cop show; Starsky and Hutch is a two cop team show and SWAT - five man team show. The release of this new CD comes at a time when Robert Blake is accused of wife Bonnie Lee Blakely's murder. It is hard to talk about this CD without touching upon current situation with Blake. For example, lines such as ""Husbands have been known to sometimes kill their wives for money"" make a sad reference to drama of his life. The truth of the matter is Blake is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

There are three-disc set containing all 12 episodes of the series' first season. All episodes are worth watching and thoroughly enjoyable; in one episode named Mansion, his first wife of real life appears as an eccentric character of the show. I think second season episodes are little more enjoyable as the show's story and writing gets better. The price of new CD is a little steep and I would recommend if you are a real fan of Baretta and not put off by Robert Blake's real life drama.",1105660800,6,1326,4.5020746887966805

1779256,5,B00006J6XH,"Although Robert Blake gave the impression he hated his own show by the time the third season came about, he will always be remembered for his finest role in television history. Baretta appeared on television after Tony Musante refused to continue it's predecessor ""Toma""(1973-1974), based on the true life exploits of Dave Toma (another excellent gritty cop show, but short lived). Unlike ""Starsky & Hutch,"" Blake carried the show as a single force out the clean up the streets. It was a tough act, but he carried it out with excellent results, with the back up of Billy (Tom Ewell), his old and faithful buddy, and ""Rooster"" (Michael D.Roberts) his imformant, and the scene stealer; his pet cockatoo bird. The series premiered ""Jan 17th, 1975, the same year as Starsky & Hutch. By just the second episode (on this DVD set) ""The Five-And-A-Half-Pound Junkie"" concerning a young girl addict ready to have a baby, you knew by watching the acting, that this series was going to be a hit, and it was. The first season has 12 episodes, and it is a very enjoyable DVD set, with attactive case and sleeve insert. It's on 3 DVD's. The only drawback is that Universal released this set in 2002, with no word on future releases of series 2 and 3, I would be leary on purchasing other box sets they come out with in the future, until they verify they will release the full series. Thanks for releasing Baretta, but please get off the old duffs guys and get series 2 out soon.... Please!",1088208000,12,1475,4.633587786259542
1779257,5,B00006J6XH,"Baretta was not the longest running cop shows on television in the 1970s. But it is perhaps the most identifiable, and one which left a lasting impression on many.
Baretta is a short man of Italian heritage, with a few good friends and a cuckatoo, working in what has to be the bleakest looking cityscape you have ever seen, with some bad, shady, weird, and wonderful characters.
He is a cop who will go to any lengths using what little he has to go on. These are his few steady friends, his beat up car, his street smarts, and a willingness to dress up and masquerade as someone, being as stereotypical as he can be in order to con the bad guy.
He is not always a success in the job, and unlike other cop shows, he isn't a success story. He loses his soon-to-be wife in the first episode, and this haunts him thereafter. He doesn't ever think himself better than anybody, and unlike other reviewers, his colorful speech may seem today politically incorrect. But to me, this actually makes him far more believeable as a character. After all, what do you base your disguises on, and the part you play when you wear them? He carries them off like someone who is trying to be a part, and if that sets on a stereotype that don't sit well in minds today, so be it. Back then, I don't think it would have been a cause for concern.
This is the same era that brought up Blazing Saddles (Far more colorful in all respects ""politically correct""), The Warriors, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, and Welcome Back Kotter. Compared to this fare, Baretta's an altarboy.
What I really remember about him best is that he was a cop that was rarely sipping coffee at the station house. Too many cop shows of that era had a stationhouse as a backdrop. Baretta is a cop that gets his hands dirty, knows his neighborhood, and is respected for it because he is always seen working within it.
I enjoyed this when I just started my teens, and I really enjoy it now that I don't have to watch it on VHS anymore. While you could give a kid something better to model himself on, Baretta is the kind of person you'd probably like to have around. No B.S., straight-talkin' cops that go after real crimes, and don't see every rule in the book as something you hammer people with just because you can.",1087516800,6,2271,4.38388625592417
1779258,4,B00006J6XH,"The quality of ""Baretta's"" early seasons may come as a surprise to people who lump the series in with some of its lesser contemporaries.

The series gets off to a great start with ""He'll Never See Daylight."" As Baretta goes after the mob boss (Joseph Mascolo) who orders a hit on his girlfriend (played by the sublime Madlyn Rhue), he methodically terrorizes the gangster, using a variety of disguises to get close to him. The direction is inventive, and Blake immediately establishes both the quirky impishness and uncompromising toughness of the title character.

Ann Prentiss is enjoyable as a duplicitous photographer in ""The Half-Million Dollar Baby."" When she uses a lovestruck Baretta to help her steal $500,000, we're able to feel his pain and yet not want any harm to come to the Prentiss character. The script is tight, and believable enough by most TV standards.

""Walk Like You Talk"" is another standout from this 12-episode first season, as Baretta is accused of taking payoffs from drug dealers. In this era when ""Serpico"" was still fresh in viewer's minds, this episode has some interesting things to say about police corruption, and how it tarnishes even innocent cops.

""The Secret of Terry Lake"" features a gorgeous Margot Kidder as a gangster's moll who fingers her lover as the killer of a mob boss.

On the downside, the show's insensitive tone creates some truly bad moments in ""Woman In the Harbor."" First, in a restaurant, Baretta asks African-American guest star Brock Peters, who plays an old buddy, if he'd like some fried chicken and watermelon. Yes, they're old friends, but the moment is jarringly awkward. Later, Baretta sneaks in to confront a bad guy by impersonating a black masseuse, wearing an afro wig and burnt cork, and speaking in a dialect that's flattering to ""Amos and Andy"" creators Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll.

Elsewhere, we see Baretta playing a flaming, sashaying homosexual, and a Mexican that might pass for one of those fat, lazy crows in ""Speedy Gonzales"" cartoons.

The problem with antics like this isn't that they're politically incorrect; the issue is that Baretta comes across as a buffoon out of a Mad magazine parody. It's one thing to have the character be playful, so that we laugh with him -- it's another for us to be put in the position of laughing AT him.

As television season-length box sets such as this roll out on DVD, there's always a question of whether or not to buy the first season if the show was a midseason replacement, as ""Baretta"" was. Certainly if you're a fan of later seasons, it pays to give the studio reason to release those sets by buying Season One. But it must be said that this set is overpriced at $39.95 SRP (and even with the Amazon discount), so for some, it will make more sense to get these discs used.

One other note: The show's celebrated theme song did NOT include Sammy Davis Jr.'s vocals in this first season. They were heard at the start of the second season (1975-76). Some people believe the vocals weren't included here because of rights issues; this is not the case. The set was released by Universal, the original rights holder of the series.",1081555200,9,3157,4.788602941176471

Baretta set the standard for all the other gritty cop shows that followed. Watching Season One of ""Baretta"" brings me back to when I was a young boy and television was at its best and the TV shows didn't disappoint. In the Season One set, you get the original pilot episode plus the next 11 episodes in great color and sound. Baretta together with his side kick Billy, the jive talkin Rooster and Cockatoo Fred, what more could you ask for. The music and theme song, sung by the great Sammy Davis Jr are worth the price of this set. If you can't pay the price you're committing the crime, so buy it already! Come on Universal Studios, give us Season 2!

But I was afraid that like a lot of things, it might not stand the test of time. Well, man am I glad to report there is nooo danger of that here. This show still rules after all these years!
Whatever hot water he may be in today, I have to say that this show would be nothing without the awesome talent and genuine personality of Mr. Robert Blake. As Tony Baretta he had a true charm and warmth that I've really missed on TV over the years. You just gotta love this guy!
And forget about Huggy-bear, kiddies. Ol' jive-talkin' Rooster is THE original streetcorner playa dat all those who've come after have tried to copy. Tom Ewell is great as Baretta's unlikely sidekick Billy too (always thought it was weird he was billed in every episode as a ""guest star"") and there's some great dialogue between them.
This show is typical 70s cheese, like the episode where Baretta buys a plane ticket to follow some hoods to Mexico with no passport, under an assumed name and in disguise as a stoned hippie -- no questions asked! Let's just see any TV cop of today's post-911 world try and pull off that little trick, heh heh.
But it seemed kind of strange that the famous theme song didn't have any words. Were the words only added in season 2? Speaking of which, WE NEED SEASON 2!!! NOW!!! -- And while you're at it, how about bringing us Cannon, Kolchak the Night Stalker, Hawaii Five-0, Mannix, Banacek and Columbo?

Some kind of cheap royalty battle must have gone on to have this classic series go out to the masses without the ""eye on the sparrow"" music with all the lyrics over the credits! Every time the music comes up, you get a slap in the face!
The only taste of the classic song was slipped into episode 4 ""if you can't pay the price"". Here we have Tony singing along to his car radio while it is playing Baretta's theme song... lyrics included!

Although the show screams 70's, there is an underlying saddness to the character and life of Tony Baretta who, in spite of his sometimes nearly superhuman antics, is just a regular gamoche like the rest of us.

Because, back in the day, Baretta was one of my two favorite cop shows (the other being Starsky & Hutch).  For a teenager in the 70's, it didn't get any better than these two shows.  What's happening with Mr. Blake in present time notwithstanding, I would've purchased this DVD and loved it all the same!  Thanks to his performance, this was the hallmark for every loner, tough-cop series that followed.  The man held your attention, he got your blood flowing, and you were indignant with righteous anger right alongside Tony Baretta.  Tony and his cast of characters (who couldn't love Billy, I ask you) made this show what it was, and it's a testament to how brilliant it was that it stands the test of time nearly 30 years later.  There are so many layers to the character of Tony Baretta...a man haunted, perhaps, but willing to do whatever it took to get the bad guys.  I love it, during ""The 5 1/2 Pound Junkie"", when he says to a drug dealer ""I'm gonna punch your time.  You be looking for me.""  Classic lines from a terrific actor who knew his business, and IMO, still does.  Thank you, Robert Blake, for giving me Tony Baretta.

Razor sharp dialog, hard action, cool one-liners, fine chicks, and some comical elements (my favorite disguise: his coming in as a black massouse with an afro that screams nineteenseventyfive).

Question There was a Baretta episode  where Baretta clashed with a FBIagent. If i recall right, the agent kept taking jurisdiction over Baretta, eventually Baretta realized the agent was corrupt. It has been 35 years since i saw the episode, i have never forgot it.
Anyone know what Season and Episode of Baretta that was?",1517184000,,392,4.82089552238806
7969917,5,B00006J6XH,"Robert Blake is one of the great American actors of the 20th century.  I believe the character of TONY BARETTA exemplifies Robert's true persona in real life.  And that's why I and millions of people love this iconic TV show of the 1970's.  Naturally gifted, this former child star has been in front of a movie camera since the age of 5.  As Mickey Gubitosi, he was one of the original kids in the ""Our Gang"" series of the late 1930's.  Since then he has starred in the movie ""In Cold Blood"" and he has appeared as a major supporting actor in an astronomical number of TV shows, winning countless awards for his outstanding work.  And as Beretta would say, ""That's the name of THAT tune"".  Today at the age of 84, after a series of unfortunate events, Robert Blake is as feisty as ever.  Recently, as a long-time fan of the show, I had tried to send him an email which he never received.  Hopefully he'll read this review and get the message: ""Bobby, no matter what the future may bring, always remember that the movies and TV shows that you have already made (especially Baretta) will forever continue to bring uplifting delight and enjoyment to millions of people.  And that's an extraordinary and great lifetime achievement that nobody can ever take away from you.  God bless"".",1515888000,2,1280,4.5701754385964914
