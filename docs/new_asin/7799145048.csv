2841117,5,7799145048,"Frozen is a colorful animated film involving two sisters named Anna and Elsa gifted with unique snow magic.  Elsa is aware of the talents that exist in both her and Elsa. However, Elsa has certain reasons for keeping them secret.  Meanwhile, they are both part of a prestigious and royal lineage.  This sets the stage for other people of noble birth who want to come and visit the sisters. Anna more than welcomes the visit, but Elsa is naturally nervous about ways to deal with this.  I also liked one of the hidden positive messages to the film where it is implied that it is possible that a person can often have more power within them than they realize.  Frozen is a lively holiday movie that is safe for all ages.",1385683200,,718,4.450381679389313
2841118,5,7799145048,"I have watched every disney animated film put out by the main Disney animation studios and all the Pixar films.  This is by far the best ""musical"" film since The Lion King.  The reason I say musical, is that I believe Wreck It Ralph was also an amazin film, but did not have the musical, classic Disney feel to it.

This is truly Disney at it's finest.  A catchy soundtrack, fun characters, especially Olaf the Snowman who stole many of the scenes he was in.  This is the first Disney soundtrack that I found myself humming to in a long time.  I actually just bought it on iTunes which is very rare for me.  Disney somehow continues to manage to put out a quality product after all these years, especially, when you think storylines are just getting rehashed over and over again.  I must admit, the marketing for this film had me confused as to the actual plot or story of the film, and I was really worried this would be a flop.  What a surprise I was in for.

It is also nice to not have a movie with a main ""villain"" and actually instead have it being more about a journey between two sisters.  This is a speical bond that sisters have and brothers have with each other, and to have this as a theme is quite refreshing.

Disney is truly heading into their second renaissance with Lasseter at the helm.  I believe Disney Animation is now surpassing Pixar on a regular basis, or at least two years running.  Wreck It Ralph was far superior to Brave, and Frozen crushes Monster's Inc.  The streak of films of Bolt (much better than expected), The Princess and the Frog, Tangled, Wreck It Ralph, and now Frozen is one of the hottest streaks Disney Animation has been on in a long time, but truly the last two of Wreck It Ralph and Frozen are destined to become classics for all time.

Bravo Disney!",1385683200,220,1797,4.367469879518072

2841120,4,7799145048,"There is no hope for any other animation studio to overtake Disney as the king of animated cinema. Despite the fact that I've noticed that most of their movies in recent years are more carefully orchestrated than challenging cinema, they have the secret potion. ""Frozen"" is without question carefully orchestrated to appeal to a wide variety of youths and adults. While the delivery is magical, beautiful and heart-warming is it also easy on the brain and predictable as they come.

""Frozen"", based loosely on the Hans Christian Anderson tale, ""The Snow Queen"", is as a whole catered toward a certain audience; preteen and above girls. There's princess', romance, singing and dancing and if the entire movie were that way, the boy Disney fans would be squirming in their seats. Disney would never make that mistake though, would they? Absolutely not. Insert a nave little fun-loving snowman named Olaf and a giant frightening snow beast and ""Frozen"" is no longer just for little girls. It's for everybody who has a heart and wants to enjoy a world where people are sickeningly kind and good-willed for a couple of hours. Well, except for a couple, but you wouldn't have a Disney movie if it weren't for a couple of bad seeds.

That being said, ""Frozen"" may be orchestrated and predictable, but it is also one of the finest visual treats Disney has produced in years. In fact, I will go as far as to predict that it will become, at some point or another, a classic that is viewed by millions every winter. Olaf the snowman may just go down as one of the best sidekicks to a leading character since Hermey from ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"".

It's a shame that more people in the world aren't as simplistic, genuine and nave as Olaf and Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell). That is the true source of Disney's magic and it is so very simple. We live in a world where we lose our innocence and simplicity way too soon in life. Disney paints a world that we've all forgotten and the kids can relate to. In the movie, Anna falls in love with a prince from Weselton in one-day and wants to be married because she's lonely. While the movie paints this as way too fast and questions what love is, we, in a matter of minutes fall in love with the characters on screen.

We've forgotten what it's like to be trusting and openly joyous. ""Frozen"" explores love and kindness like only the movie studio that built the happiest place on earth can; heavy on the cheese, heavy on the cuteness, heavy on the goofiness, a princess, incredibly visuals, equally incredible sound and beautiful singing from Kristen Bell and Wicked star Idina Menzel. ""Frozen"" is a Disney classic in the making.

This is a 5-star movie that isn't quite as good as the 6-star movie ""Tangled""... and it's a 4-star bluray release because THIS version is less of a product than Disney was capable of delivering.  The 3D version of the movie was only released in the UK and I have this 3D version. It is beautiful. I had to have it shipped OVERSEAS to enjoy it. Obviously, Disney has this product available, but American's don't deserve it, or are prime for scalping down the road. Also, what would have been a remarkable behind the scenes movie with Kristen Bell, Olaf and Idina Menzel, is explored in a 'pfft' little video that accomplishes nothing. Shame on Disney for capitalizing with such cheap tactics when they made over 40 billion in profits in 2013.... despite paying a ridiculous sum for Star Wars rights.",1385596800,,3468,4.667757774140753
2841121,3,7799145048,"We went to watch this last night on opening night because my daughter has seen the advertisements for weeks. Her favorite part is Olaf especially when he sneezes and his head falls off. Imagine our surprise when that is NOT in the movie. Matter of fact quite a few scenes from the commercials/teasers are not in the movie. The movie wasn't bad but completely misrepresented. It made it seem it was more of the snowman and reindeer but it's not. They have small roles. It is a Disney ""princess"" movie and a musical. Also like many of the older Disney movies it involves death for the parents. (I feel that should be known for any sensitive children before you go.) Overall my kids liked it although they both noticed the funny parts from the commercials weren't there. They both did immediately want to buy it on DVD but I am hesitant. I had higher hopes.",1385596800,17,854,4.516129032258065
2841122,5,7799145048,"I don't know about you, but I remember a time where Disney reign supreme in the genre of animation.  Classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King; aw, those were day. These days, on the other hand, the animated trend of Disney has died down. Yet, when an animated film does pop up, it can be a treat. That brings us to latest animated Disney feature: Frozen. After the success of Tangled, Frozen would be worked on the 2010 film's creators and be another Disney movie completely CG.  Though Tangled prove Disney Animation could be brought in a different light, how does Frozen fair in Disney's long list of animated classics?

The tale of Frozen deals with two princess: Anna (Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel). While things have been peaceful in the kingdom Arendelle, there is a secret in the royal family: Elsa has the power to control ice. After a dramatic situation, Elsa's powers go out of control bringing an eternal winter to Arendell. Anna journeys after Elsa with  the mountain man Kristoff (Johnathan Groff), his trusty reindeer Sven and a living snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad). Together, the four journey into a wilderness so they can save kingdom as well as Elsa.

While there are many classic Disney films, sometimes the films' plot can be repetitive. Frozen, on the other hand, does not fall under such stereotypes. Thanks to the two plots of Anna and Elsa, Frozen's plot was very refreshing. Plus, the pacing of the story was great by making Frozen an adventurous tale that really stood out.

With a great story came wonderful characters. It almost hard to decide who was the superior character among the ensemble. Kristen Bell brought a charismatic performance as Anna; while surprising me in other areas. Idina Menzel brought her voice and belting ability as Elsa, who was just a different kind of Disney Princess. I even liked Kristoff and Olaf, and normally can't stand the generic male love interest and comedic relief. On paper, the cast to Frozen didn't look like it was going to work. Yet in the end, this ensemble was hard not to love.

To say Frozen's animation was great seems a little redundant seeing that Disney film usually shine in this element; but Frozen has some wonderful animation. What stands out in the animation is the use of the colors and lights. This help thing such as the character stand out from the likes of Tangled's cast. Along with the animation came the music. The score by Christophe Beck was impressive, and even more so was the fact that Frozen was a musical. Speaking of musicals: Frozen has to be the one best Disney musicals in a very long time. The reason why the element work was because the movie treated itself like a Broadway musical. A rare feat, even in Disney films.

This is the point where I talked about which scenes stood out me. In the case of Frozen, the moments that stood out to me were the musical numbers. The big songs, ""First Time In Forever"" and ""Let It Go"", were great.""First Time In Forever"" was a fantastic title song giving us great moments between Anna and Elsa; plus the sound was soothing. Then there was Elsa's big song: Let it Go. The song was catchy and just great for the character. I am willing to bet that these songs will be remember in the years to come.

If you haven't guessed yet: I liked Frozen. The film was a treat for families and fans of both animation and Disney. With a compelling story, memorable character and  the Broadway atmosphere, Frozen is indeed a hit. This film is not just one of the best of the year, but it is one the best Disney for quite sometime.

2841123,5,7799145048,Best Disney movie in a very long time!! Loved it. Can't wait to go see it in theaters again and own it!,1385510400,8,103,3.727272727272727
2841124,5,7799145048,"It's unrealistic to watch animated movies these days and be able to call one better than all the rest - and that goes for Disney movies, too.  True enough, each year one animated feature eventually goes on to win an Academy Award, along with several other awards, but for the most part, even the year's most praised film looks just like the last.  Only a select few films in the last decade, like Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo will withstand the test of time and possibly earn a place in the same conversation as Disney classics, like Cinderella, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.  Still, every now and then, Disney treats animated movie lovers to something special, and to be completely honest, it's been quite a while.  This might be a bit premature to say, but Disney has finally struck gold once more (and not just commercially) with a film that has the potential to be one of the greatest animated films every created.  That film is called Frozen.

Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee write (along with Shane Morris) and direct Disney's Frozen, loosely based on The Snow Queen - a story created by Hans Christian Anderson.  The film begins with the introduction of two young children, both princesses - Elsa and Anna.  However, Elsa has the power to control the winter elements, ice and snow.  After a terrible accident, the girls' parents decide to isolate Elsa from Anna and wipe Anna's mind clean about Elsa's powers in order to protect Anna from knowing the truth.

Flash forward several years, the day has come for Elsa (Idina Menzel) to claim her right as the Queen of Arendelle.  Now an adult and Queen, Elsa must face the people of her kingdom, all of whom she has hidden herself away since she is unable to control her powers.  Unfortunately, her greatest fear comes true after an encounter with Anna (Kristen Bell), who spontaneously decides she wants to marry a visiting prince, Hans (Santino Fontana).  Unwilling to give her blessing for the marriage and angry with her sister, Elsa unintentionally unleashes her powers on the entire kingdom, instantly turning winter to summer.  Elsa quickly leaves the kingdom and rushes to the mountains, creating her own palace of ice away from anyone and everyone.  Feeling responsible, Anna embarks on a quest, along with a mountain-based ice maker, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), his reindeer, Sven, and a magical snowman, Olaf (Josh Gad), to bring the Queen home.

For whatever reason, Disney moved away from the on-screen musicals that provided some of the most memorable soundtracks in film history.  You may recall A Whole New World from Aladdin and Circle of Life from The Lion King as being just the tip of the iceberg in a massive library of memorable songs over a variety of films.  In all likelihood, Disney simply got sidetracked with spectacular new animation and the realization that 3D implementation had endless potential (which is hardly the case).  Regardless, the diehard lovers of Disney classics will be happy that the company has decided to revisit the musical aspect of storytelling.  Both Kristin Bell and Idina Menzel simply thrive with their heartfelt, energetic voices, and even though there's very little about the songs in Frozen that stand out, the hope is that Disney will continue with this classic trend.

The music, meshed with the story, easily makes Frozen one of the most unique animated features in recent memory.  Just when you think you have this story figured out it will absolutely surprise you with its misdirection.  Initially, Frozen appears to be a film that will pit sister vs. sister, sort of like a Good Witch of the North vs. the Wicked Witch of the West dynamic.  However, that couldn't be further from the truth as there is a serious amount of character inner turmoil and theme-driven action going on here instead.  One princess is desperate to protect the world from her own actions, even though she becomes exactly what she hoped to avoid.  The other princess is more traditional with her intent to find true love and save her sister, plus the kingdom (and her sister) - both of which she loves to no end.

Like the story itself, the characters are also much different than anything you'd expect out of a film of this nature.  Every little girl on this planet will fall in love with Anna, the happiest princess you could possibly ever imagine.  Kristin Bell is a splendid choice for this role, bringing an enthusiasm to a character that you can't help but adore.  She breaks out into song early and often, singing songs including Do You Want to Build a Snowman? and Love is an Open Door.  Even Menzel, who is portraying a bit of a tragic character, sings with reassurance in songs that include Let It Go and For the First Time in Forever.

The most outstanding premise in this film is the fact that there is no major antagonist.  While that is a bit surprising for an animated film, the story goes in a much more thematic direction.  Queen Elsa is the closest thing to a villain in this story, but she doesn't mean to be.  Her goal is to protect the people she cares about, but fails miserably.  As the story progresses, it becomes more about redeeming an individual that has simply lost her way and needs help to find the path back to ""the light.""  To help the Queen, there are a few odd characters that shine in their own unique manner, including a comical snowman, and a moose that loves his carrots.  Even though the film progresses in a mostly serious tone, these two supporting characters won't fail to make you laugh.

Overall, there's very little not to like about Frozen.  It contains an honest-to-goodness message that parents should feel free subjecting their children to.  The film is far lighter on the animated violence that has been much more prominent in many films recently.  And, the action sequences that do occur are either playful or of the supernatural variety.  For young boys, the constant presence of princesses may be a bit tedious, but the girls will absolutely love them.  Anna and Elsa might just be in line for the massive commercial success of Ariel and Tinker Bell.  In any event, Disney has a monster hit on their hands that will easily thrive on all formats (theater, home video, etc.) for years and years to come.

2841125,5,7799145048,Watched this last night when it came out. VERY cute. Now going to pre-order it. Loved the story line. A+,1385510400,3,104,4.25
2841126,5,7799145048,"Disney's is back with a slightly more fun animated feature and heartfelt spin on an old Hans Christian Anderson story called ""The Snow Queen"" which was first published in 1945. The original story is a darker version compared to what Disney is presenting you (as always loosely based), but it is considered one of the most acclaimed of all his Fairy Tale story's. Certainly the longest in length and the most illustrated of Anderson's works. It's called ""FROZEN""

This film features a wonderfully and positively adapted screen story by Chris Buck ( Surf's Up, Pocahontas), Jennifer Lee (Wreck-It-Ralph) and Shane Morris (The Dukes of Hazard: The Beginning) and then turned into an adapted screenplay by Jennifer, yet the film is impressively directed by both Chris and Jennifer themselves.

The story is about two sisters who end up losing their parents and living alone as the only heirs to a kingdom. One sister is special (in a very private way) and the other just fun loving, trusting, and adventurous and truly loves her big sister so very much. That is, until the big sister has to shut all of the kingdoms doors for what she believes is a very good reason. Enter a semi-interested Prince from another Kingdom and a rough `Ice Breaker' with a feisty Reindeer as a companion and you have a really fun, heartwarming and colorful adventure. Did I mention there is a magically hysterical snowman too?

The younger sister is Anna who is perfectly voiced and sung by Kristen Bell (Veronica Mars, Parks & Recreation) and her older sister (who is The Snow Queen she discovers later) is impressively voiced and sung by Idena Menzel (Glee, Enchanted). Their acting talents provide the perfect combination of what sisters can be really like. Now add an obnoxious Duke who wants nothing more than to overrun these two sisters kingdom who is voiced by Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Wreck-It-Ralph) and a foreign Prince named Hans who is voiced by Santino Fontana (Submissions Only, Royal Pains),  who has his own agenda of a sort and you have a wonderfully well thought out film with some scary and very happy moments.

Now you always need a hero and I won't spoil who the actual hero is in this film, but banded with a series of well caricatured trolls, an ice selling character named Kristoff voiced and sung by artistically Jonathan Groff (Glee, The Good Wife), a wonderfully creative snowman named Olaf perfected voiced by Josh Gad (21, The Internship) and a reindeer named Sven with a slight attitude and you have some wildly wintery fun all through the movie.

With music by Christopher Beck (Pitch Perfect, The Internship) and lyrics by Kristine Anderson-Lopez (Winnie the Pooh) and Robert Lopez (Avenue Q, Winnie the Pooh) there is a wonderful Broadway-style showstopper-type song sung by Idena called ""Let It Go"" that will amaze you. She sings it as she realizes her choices and destiny never matched and as she transforms into The Snow Queen, the art and colors will overwhelm you. Especially her dress!

Another fun song comes from Olaf called ""In the Summer"" which will have you laughing out loud because Olaf dreams of sunning on the beach. (Remember he's a snowman.) The puns and fun lyrics continue in many of the memorable songs including the two sisters beautiful duet ""For The First Time In Forever"" and the Prince and Anna's comical song ""Love Is An Open Door"".

The production and artistic design in this film is amazing and magically brought to the screen by designer Michael Giaimo (Pocahontas, Christmas Is Here Again) while the entire color scheme and overall visual effects were perfect orchestrated by Steve Goldberg (Tangled, Fanatasia 2000).

This film has a much more real story and drama dealing with the two sisters and it is sprinkled with some very funny humor throughout. A great family film for the season and much more engaging than Disney's ""Brave"" several years back. With the music thrown in with great care like Disney's more popular and entertaining ""The Princess and the Frog"", ""FROZEN"" is sure to be a family favorite as it teaches everyone what a true loving sacrifice is all about. You should go see it with your family and your friends!",1383782400,108,4165,4.863187588152328

After the 10th time I have some issues. Where are Kristoff's parents? Did he find Sven or steal him? Why does Sven only eat carrots; it can't be proper nutrition for a fully grown reindeer. How did Anna pay for her Winter gear? She'd never left the palace and therefore had no need to carry money with her. Who the heck are the royal advisors who let the only heir to the throne run off into God knows what kind of danger alone? Why did nobody have to witness the ""marriage"" between Hans and Anna? There are a lot of major plot holes in this movie and I need answers.

In reality it's horrible about toxic abusive relationships and parents that sheltered and fueled and never helped their children with major anxiety disorders. Elsa's a total biyotch because of her inability to cope with anxiety and her crap parents don't help. Ana is deluded because of desperation that having a partner might help fix the void of loneliness. She's not exactly wrong, humans are social creatures and she remembers the joy of companionship with her sister who then treats her like crap. The one stable character is Kristoff who has made the most of his abandonment issues by unnaturally creating deep bonds with a reindeer. Hopefully him and Ana can form meaningful relationships with eachother before the reindeer dies or Kristoff Will probably go the way of pre-therapy Elsa.

It's a true classic that turned out to have many unanticipated layers of meaning.  After I get done with this review I am going to go out online and see if anyone has written any serious literary analysis about this story, which has much greater depth than one typically finds in Disney fare.  As an adult on the autism spectrum, deep chords were struck in my heart by the character of the older sister, who is initially so ""frozen"" in her emotions and has strange powers that frighten those around her.  I was also shut up in a room by myself a lot when I was younger....at first involuntarily as a baby to ""get me out of the way"" while my mother was dying of cancer and later voluntarily as an older child and young adult. All I wanted was to retreat from a world full of bullies...  I won't give away too much of the plot line except to say that the tragic loss of the girls' parents early in the film broke my heart because it hit so close to home...and the undying love and support of a sibling can be life-changing.  In closing, let me say that this film can be enjoyed on many levels...  the scenery and animation alone are breathtakingly beautiful.  As others have mentioned, the characters are lively, believable and have well rounded personalities.  I'd give it ten stars if I could...",1520035200,,1489,4.308243727598566

2842133,1,7799145048,"I haven't seen a movie that is so bad in a long time... it may be suitable for some kids who are 5 to 12... maybe even up to 18 or 22. But once you are 25 or above, this movie seem so much like a formula, and the two girls in the movie don't look too womanly, but is more brash... what is the movie's goal? To educate the girls to be more brash?

And the song ""Let it Go"" is like whatever bad behavior a person has, ""Let it go"", ""Let it come out"", ""Who cares"". It is not about letting go, but about random, free radical behavior. Free radicals are what cause cancer in people's body by the way, and the song is promoting free radical behavior. And near the end of the movie, it is saying, oh, the girl is giving out ice, and once she said, ""oh it is love"", and the she is giving out summer. That is total BS, just like emperor's new clothes, the ""love"" word is just something that ""can't go wrong"". When the girl was young and play with her sister, there was so much love, and so why was she giving out ice? It doesn't make any sense. Just using the ""love"" word to sound like ""yeah, say the love word and it can't go wrong"" and it is now such a great product and great movie.",1515974400,,1175,3.936974789915966

This movie shows the unparalleled failure of the father to teach his daughter's family values. He disabled their family bond and left them all weak and prone to failure.

The clock ticking eyeballs of the opening song, the remark, ""Can I say something crazy?"", the response being, ""I love crazy!"", and even the song ""Let it go!"" which I often ridicule by saying the song lyrics are strictly that: ""Let it go, let it go! Let it go, let it go, let it go! Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go!"" You get the picture. Than the nose picking and eating your own buggers reference that ""all men do that."" Speak for your hairy self, and I'll let that one go. And for being a semi-musical, Let it go! is the only song memorable. And I don't find Olaf funny, just dorky!

I think what I loved most about it is that Elsa and Anna are different than the Disney girls I am used to.  Elsa needs saving, but ultimately a prince did not save her.  Anna needed an act of true love, and she chose to save her sister rather than kissing Kristoff.  What a great message this movie sends to little girls like my daughter.

From then on things went downhill. When the queen runs away her sister feels as though it is her duty to go find her because that is her family.

Unlike most Disney movie, this film doesn't have a male character fall in love with a female character. I like that this movie is different and breaks the norm. My favorite part is when Anna teaches Elsa how to love herself in order to love other and be a great queen. Something to take away from Frozen is that love is the greatest power. When Elsa was afraid of her powers, Anna did everything she could to help show her sister that love was the only thing she needed in her heart to control her powers. These two sisters have an unbreakable bond that show kids how strong love is. Elsa realized to let go of negative thoughts and live in positive thoughts, creating her weakness her highest strength. This family could be seen as different because both parents passed away, but the sisters love for each other shined.",1512086400,,906,4.496969696969697

2842754,5,7799145048,"Hans is not the true villain of the story, although he may be an agent of them. It's those Trolls! I can prove this too. Their duplicitous advice! Elsa's parents are described in the first page of the story book adaptation as ""kind"". What would make these kind parents lock their daughters in the castle, even isolated from each other, their whole lives? It was the Trolls! They warned the parents about Elsa, and how her powers would grow! What makes her powers grow? Fear! What do they later say will cure her powers? True love! The Trolls set their plan in motion many years ago to defeat their enemies, whom they saw as on the path to WMDs (ice magic). They were obviously fearful that a sorceress as powerful as Elsa would eventually be Queen (and likely crush them).
Back to the original deception that put the plan in motion. The Trolls, knowing that love can thaw a frozen heart, recommended isolation. As we came to learn the frozen heart wasn't Anna's all along, it was Elsa's! (Anna had already frozen, it was once Elsa saw her sister's love that her own heart thawed and the magic was undone.) The advice they give is filled with double speak, and while most believe they are friends, their aim is to climb the ladder of chaos, in true Little Finger fashion. The Trolls had a few elements to their plan here. First, they keep Elsa from harnessing her powers, making her more of a danger to herself and Arendelle than any enemies. Second, they set the parents on a path to psychologically torture their daughters, ensuring that the girls grow up mal-adjusted and easily manipulated. They convince the King and Queen to thrown out any other advisors or stewards of the Kingdom. When the Trolls managed to sink the King and Queen's ship with weather magic, there was no one left with the ability to rule the Kingdom.
The Trolls then began phase 2. The first time the gates are opened, they send an agent in to outwit the emotionally damaged girls. He was unable to get close to Elsa, but the plan succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. One night in and they secured their path of succession through Anna, who literally threw herself at the first man she was allowed to meet due to the emotional damage inflicted on her. While some believe that Hans was an independent actor, I do not believe this. He had too much inside knowledge, he knew his targets and he admitted himself that his plan was all premeditated.
The first hiccup occurs when Anna leaves the Kingdom to go after her Elsa. Anna and Hans aren't married yet, so the plan is put in jeopardy, but by a stroke of brilliant luck Anna names Hans steward of the Kingdom anyway. At this point Anna is a wildcard, so of course the Trolls send a second agent, Kristoff, to tail her. Kristoff has long term ties to the Troll organization, but as a handsome strapping man he easily ingratiates himself with Anna. He uses his cunning to make her think she is inviting him along! After reaching Elsa, where does he take her next? Straight back to the Trolls! This time the advice they give is some double speak about true love, contradicting their previous statements. It's another manipulation to get her to head back to the castle where Hans can deal with her. All the while the Trolls get to keep their hands clean.
While Anna was gone Hans used the return of her horse to mobilize the military under his command. The stated reason is to find Anna, but we learn the real mission was hunting Elsa. They find and capture her easily. Once both are back at Arendelle Hans has to carry out the Trolls' dirty work. Again the sisters manage to escape. Even now we see Kristoff attempting to lure Anna to him for true loves kiss while Hans disposes of Elsa. Thankfully she doesnt fall for this and the plan is foiled. The movie ends but still no one suspects the Trolls, and Kristoff is now embedded for their next attempt at taking over the Kingdom.",1508889600,,3903,4.529745042492918

But I sat down with my 3 yr old daughter and was totally enchanted by the first 15 minutes! The animation is cutting edge. The story is an immersive variation on Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Ice Queen' (in which many things are different; for example, the trolls are satanic, evil figures, Ilsa doesn't have a younger sister, etc). The songs are very catchy and melodic. I found myself singing 'Do you want to build a snowman?' w/ my daughter for days after we watched it. Ended up purchasing it on BR. We watch it once a week now. I can't say enough about how great this movie is, for all ages. It is also refreshingly depicts a homogenous culture (Sweden or Denmark); all the characters are white! Similar to 'Moana', another great movie that is entirely about a Polynesian/Samoan culture (no whites in it!).

2843296,4,7799145048,"Disney's Frozen plays subtly upon assumptions, stimulating reconsideration of what obstacles there may be to true love--and even whether there oughtn't be a few for young people to start with after all ! It might do to bundle those aforementioned assumptions under the label ""Pride And Prejudice-esque"" : sister dynamics in one corner, brother dynamics in the other, no real parents in either, yet the imbroglios of Elizabeth and D'Arcy more attributable ( or at least attributed ) to the mutual miscomprehension of ""classes"" than to these lovers' personal, pre-romantic, familial histories. Comparable to Elizabeth Bennett in being the younger and less ostentatiously gifted of upper-class sisters, daughters of parents distant and then untimely deceased, is Frozen's Princess Anna. Anna falls in love almost instantly with the ( Spoiler alert ! ) cad-monster, Hans, far harder-driven even than Wicked Wickham by fraternal jealousy and legacy-lust. ( Cf. ""With twelve older brothers..."" ) In part to shed clarifying-contrastive light on both Anna's and Kristoff's backgrounds, Frozen has the ( adoptive ) family of Anna's real-true-love-to-be, Kristoff, be a clan of trolls very liable to overwhelm their mild nordic orphan-friends like a flash-mob Big Troll Wedding, a tidal wave of cheeky Family Wholeness that is everything unfamiliar to Anna at least. So might we wish to fall, en famille Grecque, upon Elizabeth Bennett, whisking her past pride and past prejudice to a perfect if premature Happy Ending. But Frozen implies that one should heal psychic faults at their pre-romantic, familial origins rather than, still ignorant of the sources of one's inclinations, seeking a panacea in romance however authentic.

The Trolls, Kristoff had warned Anna, are consummate ""love experts""--but why then does Frozen have the stricken Anna faint rather than rally at the climax of The Trolls' big number about love ? Until then, under a shock-wedding gazebo, together with Hans before The Priest-Troll, Anna attends politely to their advice. As Anna's reserved looks and Kristoff's impatient expostulations meanwhile suggest, however, The Trolls' advice, if sound in itself, is nonethless directed to Hans and Anna in error. Anna is neither a snob nor a prude nor a slanderer's fool who needs prodding towards her ""fixer-upper."" Nor is she well-advised to be, as The Trolls imply she should, *less* critical. How perilously ""spontaneous"" Anna has already been in romantic matters ! And how ingeniously dark the parallel ironies of Anna's duet with Hans will prove to be : Hans has indeed been trawling for just such an ""open [ reread : carelessly unlocked ] door"" ! The Trolls are wrong furthermore to imagine that, Our Heroine rid of Hans and open to advances on Kristoff's part ( and to quote the French version ), ""tout sera regl&eacute; !"" The Trolls have been rushing Anna towards Kristoff, even just a kiss from whom will come only in the film's denouement, and ignoring her real and serious illness, which Kristoff can't help with yet. Finally, reflecting upon the rather odd fact that the ""true love's kiss"" they prescribed to Anna comes at last not from any man nor involves ""true love"" of the kind that phrase itself inevitably connotes, we should take The Trolls to task--and maybe ourselves--for conceiving Anna's challenge amidst a fog of assumptions--be they ethnic, ""neo-Austenean,"" both, or something else.

Olaf, the hilarious snowman first brought to life by Elsa in childhood and, later, brought back to life by Elsa in the midst of renewing her stolen identity, leaves far less to be desired as sidekick-advisor than The Trolls. Recall that Elsa created Olaf at her little sister's ( at Anna's ) musical appeal : ""Do you want to build a snowman ?"" Insofar as Elsa thus created Olaf not only *for* Anna and at Anna's request yet hardly ""with"" her, Olaf is a proxy for older-to-younger sororal attention never directly forthcoming from Elsa. At the same time as he is a kind of ambassador of deflected sister-love, however, Olaf is--of course, but note it--a snow*man* or -boy at least. Olaf in fact provides gentle yet not-undemonstrative opposite-sex affection with his very first breath : ""My name is Olaf, [ I'm a male snowman, by the way, ] and I like warm hugs !"" Unsupervised at this juncture and momentarily uninhibited, Elsa does get carried away by her powers just as--let's give them their parental praise-due as well as criticism--The King and Queen of Arandel strove to prevent. Elsa accidentally injures Anna, The King and Queen are horrified, Elsa descends into an inner deep-freeze that isolates her above all from her sister, and Olaf disappears for over a decade. Correlatively, soon after he is *re*created on a mountainside by Elsa Revitalised, he meets with Anna searching for Elsa : ""Did Elsa create you ?"" ""Yes."" ""Do you know where Elsa is ?"" ""Yes."" He finds the hidden staircase to her castle for Anna and Kristoff and helps them get inside past another--but this one's Angry--snowman-proxy of Elsa's creation. It is he, not Kristoff, who rescues Anna at the brink of death by explaining love to her and by his readiness to ""melt for her"" in loving self-sacrifice. Though Olaf cannot himself be Anna's true love in the inevitable romantic sense of the phrase, he is the key to the meaning of Frozen in being thus the bridge ( sometimes almost comic-literally ! ) between Anna's and Elsa's hearts, between lost childhood memories and readiness for Adult Love. Minus a few pretty pointless physical danger spectacle-scenes and just a forgiveable touch of girl-power corniness, a beautiful, brilliant, and surprisingly reflective creation from Disney.",1499731200,3,5687,5.120559741657696

2843339,5,7799145048,"This is an excellent movie with great re-watch value. I really like the graphics in HD downloaded at best quality.

The first time I watched it, I was impressed with the graphics, but the plot and story didn't stick out as to me as much. However, my appreciation of those things improved quite a bit after watching the movie more than once. You can learn a lot from the show, I think. It seems to be about love (all the way through). I notice new stuff every time I watch it.

The music is awesome, of course.

Back when it came out (quite a while before I saw it), people always ranted and raved about Elsa and how awesome and beautiful she was, and didn't have a lot to say about Annabut huh? Anna's awesome. She one of the funnest characters (and princesses) to ever have graced a movie, and she's no less beautiful than Elsa, even without the stylish blue dress and hairstyle. Her songs are no less profound than Elsa's, either, I think.

Anyway, here's some of the plot (spoiler alert):

Anna has magical powers over cold, ice, snow, etc. Anna wakes Elsa up and wants to play with her. They play. Elsa accidentally hurts Anna with her magic. They take Anna to some trolls to be healed. They heal her and warn Elsa about her powers. A troll heals Anna and removes all memories of magic from her brain. Elsa's parents decide to isolate Elsa to keep her and others safe until something or other happens, like she learns to control her powers (Elsa is in her room and won't play with Anna, or even come out and see herfor years). Their parents die in a shipwreck. Elsa is to become queen. On coronation day, Anna is really excited and goes out into the city, singing and stuff. Anna meets a prince from another kingdom; they seem to like each other. The coronation happens. Anna and Elsa are together for a bit, and they're happy. Anna and the aforementioned prince do some stuff together and become engaged (the same day they met). They ask Elsa for her blessing. Elsa is appalled and doesn't give her blessing. Some drama ensues, and Anna appropriates Elsa's glove while she's talking to her. Elsa wants it back (the gloves help to keep her powers under control). Elsa accidentally uses her powers and frightens and/or surprises everyone. Elsa runs away, and unknowingly causes a perpetual winter. Elsa sings Let It Go as she builds an ice castle and a snowman named Olaf (who comes to life) with her magic (and she replaces her black attire and her hairstyle with what she's known for). Anna goes after Elsa and wants to talk to her and convince her to fix things and come back. There's a conspiracy against the throne, and they try to use the incident against Elsa. Anna meets someone who sells ice for a living (and his reindeer) on her way to find Elsa; they help her. They find Olaf, and then Elsa. Anna talks with Elsa. Elsa accidentally uses her magic on Anna after they talk things out and Elsa still hasn't changed her mind, except this time it hits Anna's heart and can't be healed by the troll (only an act of true love can help her).  Well, there's more plot, but you can just watch the movie (I hope).

Anyway, it's an excellent movie, and I really recommend it. I recommend watching it multiple times.

I believe this is one of the best movies out there. Beyond what it says in the IMDB parents' guide (which shouldn't bother most people, even those with high standards), it's quite clean. Anna's coronation day dress (I think that was the one) could certainly be more modest, though.

This edition of the movie has lots of people singing Let It Go at the end, as well as a cartoon and some information about the creation of the movie, I believe.

On another note, Lexi Walker does an excellent rendition of Let It Go (you can look it up), which she did with the One Voice children's choir. I recommend looking at her other music, too. You can find it on the Amazon digital music store. She's a young artist (teenage, now).",1498780800,,3940,4.4673157162726005

Idina Menzel was spot-on as Elsa. Shes a wonderful performer who left me wishing during Let It Go that theyd just made Elsa a touch more fully badsympathetic, but still definitely bad. The scene later between her and Anna, in her ice castle, would have been so much cooler this way. The romances were okay, though mildly annoying like a lot of animated romances are (I personally found Flynn and Rapunzel kind of annoying), and Olaf was entertaining. But I spent much of the movie wondering quite how it managed to make 1.3 billion dollars and that got in the way of really enjoying it.

2843708,5,7799145048,"The good spirited but naive snowman and his gang of friends are adorable. Created from the imagination of two princesses, this chilly hero doesn't know his own limitations. His anthem, ""In Summer"" will play on loop in your mind and delight small children with it's humor. Another instant classic ""Do you want to build a snowman"", the lead up to our hero's first appearance, also brings humor and fun.

Olaf is a selfless hero as well, and a great inspiration that you should feel good about introducing to your children. He goes out of his way to save his princess friends from unnecessary heartache (offering to talk to rocks for them) while avoiding embarrassing new acquaintances like Christoph.

Even though the movie is named for Olaf's Frozen nature, other villainous Frozen creatures show the struggle that he has. No doubt the  villagers and princesses fear the cold, and he is constantly battling the bullying of everyone in town hoping for summer (a time that would make him extinct).

Sprinkled throughout Olaf's story are unrelated tales of sibling rivalry, young love, and the angst of youth. Overall a 5 star film for what will inevitably be remembered as Disney's most lovable winter sculpture come to life.",1496188800,2,1222,4.946341463414634

2844054,3,7799145048,"I can totally understand why this film was so successful. It's one of those rare films where the Princess named Elsa becomes a queen without marrying a guy. Heck, it's even defying the plot tropes of these kinds of movies where the Disney Princess *doesn't* find a man to marry (although her little sister seems to have a hard time choosing which guy she likes).

The animation is suberb and it's obvious that Disney spent a lot of money mastering the animation of snow, ice and even bothered to visit scandinavian countries to research their culture. The inside log jokes show they spent their money wisely.

The problem with Frozen is however a result of last minute changes to the script. The original Ice Queen story is a dark story where Elsa is pretty much the villain. Walt Disney himself wanted to make a film from this book, but he had a hard time finding a way to make the plot work because of this. After several misshaps, it was decided to make Elsa a misunderstood good guy and focus on her relationship with her little sister. The first 20 minutes of the film are brilliant.

The bad thing about making constant last minute changes to the script is that the film has a terribly uneven pace. After Cristoph and Anna are kicked out from Elsa's ice castle, the plot becomes dreadfully slow without knowing what it should do. Little 7 year old kids don't seem to mind the idle middle of the story, but it's the reason why I gave it 3 stars. The scene where Cristoph takes Anna to meet his troll friends should have been cut short and the story would have vastly benefitted. The movie's main antagonist is interesting enough but underused without a sufficiently strong presence.

After the several turns that slowed the story down, I was sort of bummed when the finale finally arrived. Elsa is indeed a super fascinating character and it's a shame the slowness of this story makes watching this film once you know what happens at the end to be utterly painful. I watched it several times in a bus and would always moan when they played it for the kids because I hate the middle portion of the film so much.

I can indeed see why so many kids like the good parts, but due to the huge lengths Disney took to make such a gorgeously animated film that they didn't revise the script to make it better I gave it 3 stars.",1492214400,,2323,4.46933962264151

2844205,5,7799145048,"This movie is incredible for its depth of human understanding that has not been appreciated since the middle 1990's era of Disney Storytelling. Why else would young children who grew up like Anna--feeling parentless and isolated so heavily identify with the obvious villain of the story--an ice queen who does terrible things out of bad behavior? Elsa froze the town! But let's be honest--she really didn't ask to have an icy anger management disorder, so we can't truly hold her at fault when we knew they were having trouble but, damn that expense we can't afford to make sure that she doesn't suffer. When the disease we refused to treat comes to a head, we isolated her and told each other we cannot help now because ...(it's the devil's drink, they do drugs, they are homeless, they have a criminal record, they can't keep a job, she had devil ice power)
It could be that one parent is suffering mental illness of any kind--depression, anxiety, alcoholism, so then the other parent is doing everything to pick up the slack. They might as well have drowned in a shipwreck--the two beautiful, well dressed girls who have everything that they need except the one thing they need most--the love and consistency of at least one person in their lives who they can unconditionally count on. This is the story of Substance Abuse in white America.
Behavior problems in children is a common identifier of poorly managed health across the spectrum. Let's take a minute and take stock of who among us grew up in a family that someone suffered from anger issues or depression or anxiety or bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or OCD or substance abuse issues or any other mental illness that did not get adequate treatment? My hand is raised very high, and judging by the chronic illness subcategory of people that I come into contact with in daily life, most of us can identify at least one person in our family that has a mental illness.
Mental illness is why the town is frozen--they don't have the money for blankets! Blankets! They are bankrupt. And that's exactly why Arendelle is a beautiful metaphor for America: Arendelle is in deep ""snow.""
The drug crisis in America is destroying America. You can not kick out you, and you don't want to admit we all need to figure it out together, but it's easier just to blame the sick person because they must be lazy, right? No. We have a responsibility to help the members of our community. The actual reason why we have this problem is because Corporate America has not figured out how to make money off the mental health crisis in America--because that is what this is--drug crisis? Poverty crisis? Crime?--all of these things are related to underlying mental illness patterns that can affect a family for literally generations.
The prison industry, drug companies, etc etc etc benefits from these issues not being well treated. How much more inexpensive can we make America if we invest money into universal health care? Not paying for prison, fighting a ""war on crime"" and a ""war on drugs"" that doesn't work because we are smashing ants instead of finding the nest and getting the underlying disease treated.
The male vilian, prince Hans, represents money interests in America: Hans is going to say anything to get what he wants--which is your money! At first America believes him--she's young, naive, and doesn't even realize that she is so broke that she literally cannot afford blankets for her family. America is in poverty because of illness. America is ready to hand the keys to the castle to a sweet-talker too.
One might wonder if Anna is going to be duped by Hans before the ending--will she wise up? She almost doesn't. She almost does not treat that illness and Save Elsa, thereby saving America too, it's almost the last hour to do that right thing. Hans has sent Elsa to her death, will America do the right thing or will Arendelle ""freeze"" and cease to exist?",1490832000,,3916,4.751835535976505

2844780,5,7799145048,"Coming on strong on the heels of The Princess and The Frog and Tangled, Frozen is Disney prodding at the edges of their established tried and true formula. In a run of films that established the return of Disney to their heyday in the 90s, Frozen is great film with a few weakness, most notably their musical numbers outside of Let It Go.

The visuals are amazing, and the film is watching for those alone. The plot is pretty strong, too with a few holes in it; most notably the set up, where the trolls warn the parents to train Elsa and not to scare her... and then her parents proceed to terrify Elsa and stop her from using her powers ever again.",1486598400,3,650,4.284552845528455

However, there are somethings about the movie that I and others do consider goofs.  Despite these goofs, perhaps the animators were extremely tired and ran out of coffee or something, but when the two characters fall over 90 feet down and they tied rope around there waists after they hit the bottom you notice the rope magically disappears.  If this film was more like movie ""The Secret Life of Pets"" that would be OK though.  When the animators, producers, cast, and and everyone else sing about how they eventually reveal how they created the movie ""Frozen"" they end with a surprising (and perhaps a little funny) answer.",1483574400,,790,4.737226277372263

We both love the music. She loves the princesses. i love that the main characters are strong women. The only scary part is when the large snow monster chases them, and even that is pretty tame. What is harder for a 4yo to grasp is a bad guy that seems like a good guy at first (Hans). She struggled with understanding his role in the story - and ultimately it helped us talk about ""tricky people"" (the updated version of ""stranger danger"") and how you can't judge people on a brief interaction.

2846050,2,7799145048,"My 4 year old cries every time she sees anything related to Frozen. She doesn't like the male characters, any of them. And Olaf freaks her out. She might have liked the reindeer, but she'd have to deal with the rest of the movie in order to see him, so she'll pass. As for me, I heard the soundtrack on Disney Pandora station before I ever saw the movie. It was a little off-putting and inappropriate for children (the duet between Ana and Hans ""Love is an Open Door""). Ana is a little to romance-obsessed for my liking, since I have a daughter. Many people love and adore the movie. This is just my perspective.",1483228800,2,612,4.3304347826086955

When she finally loses control and flees into the mountains, the land is plunged into winter and her sister must go after her while sinister forces conspire to seize control of the kingdom.

This is a terrific adventure with plenty of humor and good songs.  Although viewers of any age or gender can enjoy it, a Disney princess film is largely intended for young girls, and this one cleverly subverts some long-standing Disney tropes to deliver the message that girls should stick together and not depend on boys to complete them.  The animation is predictably stunning.",1483228800,,679,4.827586206896552

2846164,4,7799145048,I found the producers of this film struggling with the story line in their attempt to break away from the Disney traditional story line ( girl meets prince charming and live happily ever after). In my estimation they're attempt to appeal to the adult fell somewhat short. However it is a nice film for the child (ren) in your home. The songs are great. The 3D visuals were mediocre.,1482796800,2,382,4.550724637681159

I wish I could deduct half a star for just one thing though: near the end (no spoilers for the two people in the world who haven't seen this yet), a female character punches a bad guy in the face. The crowd cheers and laughs. This is not OK. The bad guy was no longer a threat and the violence against him was unnecessary and in my opinion sent a bad message. Far better to just have the queen tell her guards to take him away to await trial.

Overall, a great movie and one that I don't mind watching over and over again. Which, if you have kids, you will be watching it over and over and over...!",1482624000,,838,4.264150943396227

2846258,3,7799145048,"I watched this movie three years ago. It was the first Disney movie I'd watched in years, I remembered almost nothing about the ones I'd watched when I was small, and i viewed it because my sister persuaded me to. At that time i knew little about Disney princesses, nothing about the movie and nothing about the politics surrounding it. I didn't see the plotholes and thought the music (most of it, anyway) was great, the story of separation was heartbreaking because I was close to my own sister, Anna  was adorably naive and optimistic, Elsa was nice, Olaf was funny / cute, it was a good thing that Kristoff showed up because Hans and his ""Love's an Open Door"" caterwauling were revolting,  the messages about love were heartwarming, and the ending was beautiful and made me write a long chapter story about a wintertime adventure. When I learned that so many people were drawing the message, ""You don't need no man! Men will betray you or let you down! Grrrrl power!"" I was pretty taken aback. I didn't want to think it was a movie about hating or mistrusting an entire gender or pretending you don't ""need"" help or love from the opposite sex. But eventually I had to admit that most of Disney's modern movies are filled with girl power agenda, some more than others, and Frozen was no exception. Of course, in all actuality, Frozen wasn't as GOOD at making its female characters ""strong and independent"" as it had been trying to be. Elsa is a vulnerable and fearful individual who flees from her problems, and Anna, sweet and optimistic though she was, wasn't all that bright and needed Kristoff to help her do most of what she needed to do. But it does seem that the intent was there, and the directors probably knew no one would care how dumb or cowardly the main characters were as long as they weren't saved by a man in the end. We then got Maleficent, which was basically a Frozen ripoff, only more psychotic and weird. Plus there's so much that doesnt make sense. It never made much sense to me, though I ignored it, that Olaf didn't save Anna when he showed her love. It also made no sense that Kristoff didn't kiss her. Obviously he loved Anna because he went through so much for her; the trolls didn't say Anna had to love him back, and i would think saving her life would have taken priority over getting her to her ""true love"" first. It's all poorly written.",1482364800,2,2374,4.505800464037123

I wish however that i did NOT get the ""plus bonus features"" part of it as it adds on a lot of extra time at the end and if you stop in the middle of the movie or after the movie, you can not find where you left off because of all this extra time at the end.  Two other things I would change are: 1. Why does Anna have to punch her ex-fiancee in the face? When she does it she is just expressing her anger and not saving someone at that moment. 2. Why are the women's eyes so enormous? They look a bit like aliens.",1481500800,,580,3.8739495798319328

2846577,4,7799145048,Charming modern day fable. Great story that kids can enjoy and parents can also watch and be totally entertained. Whats really beautiful is that it turns the princess fable on its head. I don't want to spoil anything and will just say that its so refreshing to see the female character be strong yet so sweet. The pacing is fast and moves along with not really a dull moment anywhere. Highly recommend this beautifully animated modern classic from Disney. I would think if he were around today Walt would be proud.,1480204800,,514,4.65934065934066

2846754,4,7799145048,"I am a feminist and I am very particular about what I let my daughter watch. I think many children's movies have negative messages for little women: beauty over brains, you need a man to be happy, you need a man to save you, give up everything you know for a man, falling in love and marrying is our life's purpose, you need a perfect body, etc. I enjoyed this movie. Is it perfect ? No. It still pushes the typical American Cosmopolitan Industry's starved body shape, and Barbie looking features; however, instead of ""finding true love in a man"" the main characters, two sisters, find true love in each other. It is women saving women and fighting the patriarchy (Elsa's father telling her to hide/not feel her emotion/fear; the Prince who tries to steal Elsa's throne; the other male king's demonizing her for having power); alas with the support of a more evolved feminist male character, Kristoff. I also like the message it sends to little boys via the character Kristoff stating that boys don't need to be perfect, controlling, white knight's; being oneself/genuine (no matter how goofy) and being supportive is what we need to be for each other. Women don't need to be saved, we are strong. We can save ourselves. Anyway, I approve. My daughter is in love with this movie and she eagerly awaited the birth of her sister even more so because of it :)",1478476800,,1356,4.630705394190872

8197605,5,7799145048,"2 yr. old nephew LOOOOVES this one. This is actually the first feature length film that held his attention for almost the entire movie, and is the first movie he began to ask for. He knows all of the songs and enjoys humming along. Olaf is his favorite character, and he also loves ""Let It Go"" and will do a dance along with the song. Too adorable. The movie is sweet, beautifully illustrated, and jam packed with extremely catchy tunes. Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell are amazingly talented in their vocal range and ability, and make for a movie that IS for children, but can be enjoyed by adults as well. This one is worth watching!",1526774400,,633,4.4655172413793105
