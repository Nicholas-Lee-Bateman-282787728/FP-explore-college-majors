First of all, this is not HD or even close to that quality. It was recorded in 1997 and it shows. It is not bad but for some reasons I had expected it to have a better quality when it comes to picture definition. You can without problem see what engines and cars that are being used but not the finer print on the sides of the freight cars.

An other expectation I had was to see different trains from the New England area. This was not so. Almost all the footage are of the same engines with the exceptions of a few minutes of Amtrak and Guilford. I was expecting to see a large number of NEC engines and freight cars and also their yards but not so. One hour of looking at the same train (ok, they switch freight cars a few times) is maybe too long.

The Narration is very sparse and limited to telling where the video was taken. It would have helped a lot to start the video by showing a map over the area. If you do not know the area yourself you will have almost no idea of distances, directions etc.

Finally on the negative side, apparently trains in the US have to sound their signal horns when they pass a crossing road. For safety reasons since a lot of crossings do not have any road barriers. The Problem here is that most of the video is shot close to a road crossing so you will for almost 60 minutes hear these trains sound their horns and they are loud! It gets old fast. It would have been a much better alternative to locate spots where the train did not have to signal all the time.

But on the positive side this is a historic document from 1997. That is 13 years ago and you just cant travel there anymore. You do get to see NEC trains travel through New England and you can see how they are made up and how the engines are behaving. If you live somewhere else and are interested in this area this is still wort seeing.",1385510400,,2054,4.137844611528822
