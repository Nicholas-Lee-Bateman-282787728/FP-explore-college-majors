8112995,3,B000EQ5TP6,"The Vertical Features Remake is a joke that goes on too long for me. I saw no real artistic value outside of that, though the filmmaker goes on at length about it being a multi-dimensional study of structure in the included featurette.

The Falls is a really neat surrealistic idea, perhaps also a trifle overlong (I saw the 3 hour movie in several forty minute sessions) that fascinates and amuses me just for it's face value as a lunatic study of a bizarre event with seemingly random toxic effects. I saw it as a goon-show inspired surrealist comedy.

For me it was badly, even fatally marred by the absolutely dire quality of the (mono) sound track. In places it was so loaded with strident transients my ears rang too much to hear the dialog. Too heavy in high frequencies. I realize that the movie is attempting to ""up the amateur"" in places but even so the sound really needs leveling and balancing.

The DVD also skipped in several places.

Besides the two films and the ""Greenaway on Greenaway"" featurette there are some still assets from the movies.",1460764800,,1059,4.647058823529412
8112996,5,B000EQ5TP6,"""The Falls"": an epic film that is a gargantuan send up of the minutiae of extreme scholarship. The 92 biographies of victims of the Unexplained Violent Event [UVE], which may...or may not...have something to do with birds, proceed with icy, statistical, bureaucratic force. The actual characters are absurd and/or implausible. The balancing act of whit and whimsy and statistical cataloguing is masterful. The UVE is never fully explained even though we have 3 1/2 hours of detailed examination [Clearly more work must be done...AAAAHHHHRRRRGGGGHHHH!]. It's much much much ado about nothing... and hysterical. Even the 92 examples here are connected by cross referencing and roundabout links. It's all very complicated. But of course even though archival footage is used and real people and events are sprinkled throughout, it is all made up. So sit back and just enjoy the ride. It's a film about people who learn Klingon or argue over details in ""Lord of the Rings"". But also about historians who's expertises are about a single year or event and scholars of single artists or even single works of art. It's about a human activity. It's about being a thinking ape. It's wonderful!",1174262400,3,1182,5.097938144329897
8112997,5,B000EQ5TP6,"British director Peter Greenaway considers ""The falls"" the most emblematic film of his career: it's an inventory of his most beloved obssesions; a synthesis of his previous work as filmmaker and a seed of future projects.

THE FALLS ( 1978 ), his first feature length movie, is a catalogue of 92 invented biographies of people whose names begin with the word "" falls "" and affected by an unknown illness ( the U.V.E. ) in some way connected with birds and flying. This is, in fact, a seminal work of Greenaway's particular mithology and at its time a game of mirror where he blends bizarre situations, human mutations, archive footage, documentary techniques, humourous self-references ( he introduces in a new way stuff of his previous films ) and conceptual playing inside of a structure whose peculiar characteristic and form - as Greenaway has told- can be reformulated and extended ""ad infinitum"". But the movie is also a sardonic and creative demostration of scepticism where Greenaway plays to rub out the border between fiction and reality. "" The falls "" is probably the film that better reflects Greenaway's conception of cinema, so as his voluptuous personality and enciclopedic wisdom: his passion for catalogues and dictionaries; his interest in structuralism theorising and conceptual games; his taste in weird artefacts, bizarre invention and the theatre of absurd; his love for painting and barroque visual invention and his miscellaneous erudition and fine humour.

The score has been composed by Michael Nyman.",1154304000,8,1527,5.178137651821863
