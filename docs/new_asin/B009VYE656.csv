5369907,5,B009VYE656,I wish they would convert the whole series to USA region DVD so I don't have to wait so long between episodes. Can't wait for the next one!,1360281600,,139,4.0
5369908,5,B009VYE656,"Some writers on this board have expressed their disappointments with Season seven (7) of `Waking the Dead"".  Season seven (7) was NOT disappointing to me, as a long time fan of ""waking the Dead"", in the least.

  The two (2) episodes in two (2) parts on each of the three (3) discs in Season Seven (7), as always, were highly intense  and  with unforeseen, by me, outcomes.  I really enjoyed season seven (7) of ""Waking the Dead"" finding it so very well acted, written and directed.

The leader of the Investigative team of ""cold cases"" that usually have tie-ins with current murders is DSI Boyd (brilliantly acted by Trevor Eve) who is particularly cranky, short-tempered and bossy this season mainly due to the appearance of his ""long lost"" son.  Thank god, Grace (wonderfully acted by Sue Johnston) is on hand to calm and to ""ground"" him.  His ""support"" team consisting of a pathologist (she's very astute with a  severe smokeing habit)  and two (2) other investigators (both greatly acted; with hunky Spence, wonderfully acted by Wil Johnson, being a standout) all of them are not afraid to show their expertise in their field and often go ""toe to toe"" in disagreements with their leader--certainly that is one of the reasons that I have always loved this very fine British Murder/mystery series.

All-in-all, I really enjoyed Season Seven (7) of BBC's ""Waking the dead"" (there are some really nasty cases involving horrific murders,terrorism, brutal Neo-Nazis, racism, many war-time atrocities, severed heads,  Aids, child abuse, homophobia,  etc.)  I truly found each episode very exciting and mysterious  putting me ""on the edge of my seat"".  By the way, Season Seven (7) has a very emotional ending.",1359158400,,1707,4.971731448763251
5369909,2,B009VYE656,"We have enjoyed every episode of the first six seasons of this well acted British 'cold case' police adventure.  We are very disappointed in the writing and story lines of nearly all of those in Season Seven.  They are difficult to follow, sometimes excrutiating in their subject matter and, in general, we wish we hadn't purchased this set.",1358726400,,341,4.862068965517241
5369910,1,B009VYE656,"This is not The Walking Dead. Bought this product believing that the most badass time traveler from the future, brought back a s***load of copies of season 7 from the future. I was shaking with anticipation as I opened the package. I took off an entire week of work to wait for my trusty neighborhood UPS delivery guy to drop of my gift from the future. I tore open the package foaming at the mouth as the UPS man (Fred was his name if I recall), watched in horror. I then proceeded to try and open the DVD case. But I've always had a problem peeling off those stickers so I decided to smash the case against my floor until it busted open and revealed to me this gift from god. I picked up disc one and crammed it into my DVD player. I was horrified by what I saw, not crazed zombies from the future, but I saw the face of Trevor Eve. I began to shake violently, this began to shake up the contents of my stomach, which caused to me to start spraying vomit all of the room. I tried to scream but all that came out was gurgles and more vomit. At this point I had no control over any of my bodily functions. My ass erupted like a volcano and my buttmudd was pouring out at an alarming rate. After this whole ordeal I was drained, I collapsed to the floor, and began to slip into a deep sleep. I awoke three days later to the stench of my own fluids, and cursed myself for not reading the title more clearly.

Long story short this IS NOT The Walking Dead.",1358553600,,1453,4.098245614035088
5369911,5,B009VYE656,"Grace Foley is awesome! The series has great plots, a great cast, characters that are real and multidimensional, and is just an all around excellent thriller/suspense/drama program with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. If you love British mysteries, this one is a must see.",1354060800,8,284,5.0638297872340425
5369952,2,B009VYE656,"Seasons 1-5 were good and the show recovers from the debacle that is season 6 and 7 quite nicely, but 6 and 7 have one okay story ""Yahrzeit"" and a whole bunch of terrible stories. The attempt at character development with the death of Boyd's son fails and the relationships between team members gets flattened. There are also a couple of jump the shark moments that don't work (because sometimes stuff like that does). I almost did not bother with 8 and 9 because of 6 and 7 but they are well worth oer leaping the dead zone that happens in this series.",1400630400,2,553,4.378640776699029

5369954,5,B009VYE656,"I love this series. It's filled with excellent characters, acted by excellent actors. Season Seven was even better than previous seasons and that says a lot. Now I can't wait fro Season Eight to get to the US. I wish they would put them all out immediately!",1389225600,2,257,4.48936170212766
5369955,5,B009VYE656,I have been watching this mystery for a long time. I enjoy the closeness of the characters. I like more of a story then private lives. This series gives me that.,1389052800,,161,4.225806451612903
5369956,5,B009VYE656,"Trevor eve and the rest of the cast do it again. With another fine season. His performance is emmy worthy , especially when the subplot of his drug addict son enfolds over this season. It's one of the worst things that can happen to a parent after all having your kid on dope.  Every story in this series is good , however the episodes dealing with the military unit are rather offensive. They are extremely anti military and they ridicule the very nature of the service.  So you might want to skip those two episodes on disc two.  The show lasted two more seasons and had strong ratings up until the end.  But execs wanted newer shows and didn't care about the ratings.  So at least we have this season on dvd for us to enjoy. This season was from 2008 , the year the worlds economy melted down,  to put that year into context.  The stories were as good as usual.  And the dvd looks great.  If you haven't watched this internationally acclaimed show then start at the first season. But you could start at this one and enjoy it just as much. the picture is really good on this set as it was shot in hd. However we only get a standard dvd picture here.",1381536000,,1151,4.267281105990784
5369957,3,B009VYE656,"As always this series has high production values, good acting, and some interesting twists. But, unlike some other reviewers here, I feel things are getting a bit repetitive after some 60+ episodes.

Each episode starts pretty much the same way (accidental unearthing of a long dead body), and as the team untangles the details of the crime we see a series of flashbacks showing the events leading up to the original crime, which tends to always be some sort of ""heavy"" political or social issue-driven thing. The directing style is similarly repetitive; flashbacks are inevitably in washed out format with hand-held cameras, and are shown in little tiny sound bites; often these same clips are shown again and again, giving the impression of padding out a thin plot to the desired program length.

Still well worth watching, but I wish they had tried to mix in a few less ""deep"" episodes; after all not every cold case is about a terrorist/madman/corrupt someone-or-other. Earlier series seemed to have more originality imho, though of course this is hardly surprising.",1377216000,,1070,5.03954802259887
5369958,5,B009VYE656,"I really like all the other seasons I have of Waking the Dead, but this season won't be released until September.  This is a preorder, so I don't have it as of yet.",1373241600,,164,3.9696969696969697
5369959,5,B009VYE656,"Each episode just seems to get better.  I get really frustrated, angry, and all in all really into the happenings!",1369958400,,114,4.7
5369960,2,B009VYE656,Exciting but poor quality of DVD. It kept skipping and whenever I put it on stop it would go back to the beginning.,1369353600,,115,4.043478260869565
5369961,5,B009VYE656,This is England's version of Cold Case Files except it is much better.  The writing and the characters are outstanding.  I really enjoyed it and all the rest of the series.,1368057600,,172,4.516129032258065
5369972,5,B009VYE656,it just gets better and better.  Trevor Eve wears this role like a second skin and the remainder of the cast is first rate. I really recommend this series for fans of British crime dramas.,1368057600,3,188,4.371428571428571
5369973,4,B009VYE656,Love the characters in this British series.  Thanks for sending it so quickly.  Had watched the earlier episodes on Netflix.  This DVD came in perfect condition as advertised.,1364688000,,175,5.178571428571429
5369974,5,B009VYE656,"7 years and this series has only gotten better.  Trevor Eve is excellent, as usual, as well as the rest of the cast.  Every story line is original and you never feel like the show has gotten ""tired"".  In fact it has gotten better every year.  Only wish they wouldn't wait so long to put the DVD's out in USA format sooner...there are at least 2 more still only in non-USA format.",1364515200,,379,4.222222222222222
5369975,5,B009VYE656,My review of season 4 expresses my same opinion as season 7.  The whole series is addicting.  When you have watched one you will want the whole series.,1363824000,,151,4.357142857142857
5369976,5,B009VYE656,"As a US citizen without BBC America, I wait every year for the release of the DVD for Waking the Dead.  Each year I think it can't be surpassed, but each year brings new surprises.  Still, Season Seven has to be the best ever.  Incredible stories and equally incredible acting not just from the regulars, but from guest artists as well.  I can't wait for the last two seasons to be released in US format.  I understand that this show is completed - it will be sorely missed.",1363651200,,474,4.340909090909091
5369977,3,B009VYE656,"It seems each season I watch Waking the Dead the ""boss"" gets more and more unbearable. This series was no exception. Boyd has problems he chooses to keep to himself and the rest of the team pay for his attitude. At least the final disc of the season brought some relief. Hopefully season 8 will be more congenial.",1362614400,3,313,4.413793103448276
5369978,5,B009VYE656,"I have all 1 thru 7 Seasons and find that this season is the best yet.  Trevor Eve is one of British TV's best detectives.  I would

5369979,5,B009VYE656,I love this series but I cannot understand why it takes to so long to get an American version to market..,1361404800,,105,4.0476190476190474
5369980,5,B009VYE656,"This is my favorite TV show.  The stories are complicated, and the characters have such diverse personalities.  I like having to concentrate closely to follow the show.  It's a truly well-written mystery series.  I can't wait for the next season to be released.",1361059200,,261,5.0
5369981,5,B009VYE656,I really love British programs...I think of this series as the precursor of  CSI.  The Brits portray their characters as real people with real flaws and not the plasticized US versions.  I have all of the Waking the Dead series that have been put out and eagerly await the next one.  This series 7 did not disappoint!,1360540800,,317,4.508771929824562
