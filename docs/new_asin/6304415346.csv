862796,5,6304415346,"I have to admit that I was an original series diehard; though I liked the TNG crew, my heart was still with Capt. Kirk, Spock, etc.  The TNG series was fairly good overall but I didn't embrace it like the original series  even though I thought a few episodes were excellent, especially the final 2  hour episode ""Good Things.""  The previous movie,  ""Generations"" did not change my opinion.  I thought Kirk, Scotty  and Chekhov stole the show in the beginning of the movie.  TNG Crew  rebounded with a good showing but Picard and Data carried the story with  disappointly small roles for the rest of the crew.  First Contact,  however, with the TNG is excellent.  My mind is beginning to change!  Picard turns in an excellent, physical performance and is a worthy  successor to Capt. Kirk.  Data isn't close to Mr. Spock of course but he is  excellent in his own right.  The story was great; the Borg made a worthy  opponent for the TNG crew. Alfre Woodward as Lily Sloane and James Cromwell  as Zefram Cochrane are great additions to the Trek Universe....My only pet  peeve is that how come the Glenn Corbett as the original Zefram Cochrane  looks different from the older, more grizzled James Cromwell????",912729600,2,1206,4.697115384615385
862797,5,6304415346,"This film has it all!  Depth for all the charactors, action, romance and killer special effects.  The Borg are awesome!  For the diehard Star Trek Next Generation fan, this is a must film to watch.  Capt Picard, Data, and  the whole history of First Contact are great.  Jonathan Frakes gets to show  his humor and he hits a winner.  Star Trek fan or not, this is a very  entertaining movieto watch.",912297600,,398,4.492957746478873
862798,3,6304415346,"If you're reading this, you probably are a star trek fan, and for those fans who have yet to see this one, don't expect too much.  It's alot of fun to see borg assimilate the crew for the first 20 minutes but after that it  becomes redundant and loses its edge.  However, if you are not a die hard  trekker, I reccommend this movie as a good look at the trek franchise  without the confusing techno-babble that turns off so many.  There is a lot  of action and excitement, and most people should enjoy it.",912124800,,505,4.252631578947368
862799,5,6304415346,"In spite of a few elements that don't fit well this is one of the best of the Star Trek Movies.  Patrick Stewart gives an excellent performance as do the rest of the ""crew"".  The Borg stories were always some of the  best and this one gets deeper into the Borg than any of the series episodes  did.
The picture quality and sound are excellent, especially on the DVD  where the Dolby Digital 5.1 channel sound track is outstanding.  The DVD  uses the anamorphic widescreen format for the best possible resolution on a  16x9 widescreen TV and it is truly spectacular when displayed this way.",911779200,,589,4.542857142857143

An especially strong directorial debut by Jonathan Frakes.  Nice score by Jerry Goldsmith.  I love its hopeful view of the future, although I note with some amusement that while Captain Picard espouses a cashless, socialist-style future, the actor, Patrick Stewart, never turned down money and had the capitalist ethos of cashing those checks!",1504137600,,480,4.9625

863161,3,6304415346,"I enjoyed this when it came out in the theaters, but it does not hold up well over time. It has a tv production look and feel to it. And I have a big problem with the editing/story structure. On the ship, Captain Picard is battling a Borg takeover of the ship. It's very intense and serious. On the planet, Riker and his gang are helping Zefram Cochran launch is warp drive ship. Communication is cut off between the crew on the ground and Captain Picard on the ship so they don't know what's happening with either of them. Here's the problem--they keep cutting back and forth. On the ship, it's dark and intense. And on the planet, it's light hearted and almost jokey. The mood swings from the back and forth cuts between the scenes is jarring. I don't know who would write a movie like this.",1499299200,,793,4.364864864864865

863293,4,6304415346,"In what is perhaps the best of the Star Trek movies up to 1996, the year of release (yes, that includes The Wrath of Khan), Jonathan Frakes not only plays Cmd. Riker (#1) but is also behind the camera as director.  Picking up on a plot from the Star Trek: Generations TV series, the Federation has to take on the Borg, perhaps their greatest nemesis.  The Borg are moving toward Earth, assimilating all in their path.  The Federation launches a counter strike against the giant blackish-green cube they call a space ship.

Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his newly outfitted Enterprise (E-class) is sent to the neutral zone in order to keep the Romulans from taking advantage of the battle.  When the Federation begins losing ground, Picard disobeys orders and engages the Borg.  We see early on the influence of the Borg on Picards thinking.  They once held Picard captive.  Now you wouldnt know this unless you had seen the TV series, although it is later discussed by him and the crew.  Because of his knowledge of the cubes weaknesses, the Federation is able to takeout the Borg ship.  But they manage to launch a spherical probe and are programed to make a time jump back to April 4, 2063.

With the Enterprise close on their heels, they get caught in the temporal wake and go along as well.  The date is important.  It is when a spunky, usually drunk astrophysicist named Zefram Cochran (James Cromwell) launches into space to test out his new warp-speed drive.  It is also when Earthlings first encounter creatures from another planet (Vulcans).  This meeting changes the worlds and the future of space travel.  The Borg want to blow up the rocket before it gets off the ground and change history.

Geordi (LeVar Burton), Beverly (Gates McFadden), Troi (Marina Sirtis) are here, but like Riker and even Worf (Michael Dorn) have little to do in this film.  The film features Picard, Data (Brent Spiner) and their battle of wits and emotions with the Borg Queen (Alice Krige).  She and her collective manage to assimilate most of the Enterprise crew.  Picard and Data lead those not affected, along with a friend of Cochrans (Alfre Woodard) to safety.  Data is eventually captured and subjected to the sexy overtures of the Borg Queen.  Under all that oily white skin and skull cap, shes hard to resist and Krige makes the best out of the juicy role.

With the crew now in escape pods, Picard stays aboard to rescue Data, even though the ship is in self-destruct mode.  The slow moving Borg aren't the real problem.  It is how far Data been altered by Queeny.  Frakes has a good handle on the direction.  The story moves along nicely, the shipboard altercations are well done and the Jerry Goldsmith score sounds like something out of a 1950s Western.  Perfect.  The film even has a few characters from the Voyager TV series that hard core fans will recognize.  I will say that this may not sit well for first timers of the series but for most of us, its terrific.",1491091200,,2972,4.670520231213873

Each time it was a real pleasure, seeing the Next Generation crew battle the Borg and travel back in time to one of the key events that shaped they world they know and love. Fantastic special effects, great acting from Patrick Stewart and the cast, especially Johnathan Frakes, Levar Burton, and Brent Spiner.  Frakes also shows true talent behind the camera as a director, tackling the themes of revenge, humanity, and hero worship. Even if you are not a Trekkie, this is a very easy film to follow, although seeing a few of the Borg centric episodes of the television series first does help. Especially, The Best Of Both Worlds, since it gives you a better understanding of Captain Picard feelings about the Borg. Even 20 years after its release, it still holds up well and in our troubled times it message of hope for the future is more important than ever.",1483920000,4,922,4.621951219512195

863688,5,6304415346,"One of my favorites of TNG.

It's too bad they reinvented star-trek and started all over again... I wish they had made more movies and shows about the post-Voyager and DS9 era of star-trek, at least as far as the post-Dominion times and destroying the Borg, whenever that would have been in the canon years. I also wish that ENT had continued for another couple seasons. It's a real shame... Kirk is just old news, and messing up the time-line with things like transwarp-beaming and other stuff that shouldn't exist in the 2200s is sad, especially since in keeping with Enterprise and Voyager, the 29th century (and onwards) timeships should have corrected that timeline back to the original. Might I also add that the Klingons don't look right at all. Nor the Romulans. They'll probably mess up the Cardassians too.
There was a huge universe, with infinity in four dimensions to explore, and the viewers, and the producers had to ruin it. That was a real shame.",1468886400,4,962,4.7604790419161676

I had not seen the movie on the big screen since 1996, and did so tonight thanks to the current state of high performance home theater front projection and sound systems. I was blown away by how terrific it looked, and having forgotten much of the story, really enjoyed re-visiting it.  Matt Leonetti's cinematography looks magnificent!  Hats off to David Luckenbach's and Mike Weldon's terrific work. Now, full disclosure: I was on the crew of this show, and loved every moment working with Jonathan Frakes, the cast, Matt Leonetti, and all the crew. The NG cast was definitely a family, often hilarious, and wonderful to work with. Definitely a career high point! Picture and sound quality of the transfer are excellent, even on a demanding big screen. If you haven't seen this one in a while, it's worth a nostalgic re-visit.

863781,5,6304415346,"Of all the TNG Star Trek films, this definitely has to be my favorite.  The Killer Queen of the Borgs... what more need said?  (You can almost hear Queen singing their 1974 song.)  Even the CGI in this ""episode"" is fantastic, especially the scene in which Picard is holding the body and spinal column.  However, that's not really the center plot of the film.  What is is when Enterprise-E enters a temporal snag and leaves the 24th Century and enters the 21st Century.  In order to get back, Picard and crew must ensure Zefram Cochran makes the first ""Faster Than Light"" (warp) flight.

Star Trek VIII: First Contact is another in a long series of Star Trek films.  This, the second of TNG, is directed by co-star Jonathan Frakes.  Personally, I think he's far better behind the camera than he is in front, but those are MY thoughts.  Frakes does a grand job of keeping things moving, keeping the flow, and best of all, keeping the crew together.  At his point, these actors have been working together for nearly a decade.  They have gelled as a team, as a crew.

First Contact is a very fun movie.  The introduction of the Borg during the 1989 season left a huge impact on the culture of Star Trek as a whole.  These were viscous opponents, with the exception of Hugh Borg, who had nothing more in their collective minds than total domination.  First Contact rocks and this is one film I can really get behind Picard as the skipper.",1464912000,,1433,4.517509727626459

864227,4,6304415346,"Released in 1996 and directed by Jonathan Frakes, Star Trek: First Contact features The Next Generation characters taking on the Borg, a collection of species that have been turned into cybernetic organisms functioning as drones in a hive mind called the Collective. In order to escape imminent destruction by the Federation, a Borg mini-ship flees back in time to 2063 to prevent the renowned Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) from accomplishing the first warp drive and the subsequent first contact with an alien race, which later leads to the birth of the Federation of Planets. Alfre Woodard has a key role as a colleague of Cochrane.

The Borg are an excellent villain and one of the greatest contributions of The Next Generation TV series, along with all the elaboration on Klingon culture. Here the Borg are augmented by the introduction of a Queen (Alice Krige), which some feel detracted from the impersonal and eerie race while others think enhanced them; it makes no difference to me.

There are some gems to mine from the proceedings, like Cochranes revelation of his carnal motivations for developing warp drive and Picards hell-bent desire to annihilate the Borg. Speaking of Picard, Patrick Stewart carries the film with his unique star power, which is very different than Shatner, but just as effective. Interestingly, The Next Generation TV series never developed a prominent triumvirate like Kirk/Spock/McCoy, but rather a dyad, Picard and Data. Whereas this duo was core to the previous TNG film, Generations, and the last one, Nemesis, its not as evident here until the last act when Picard attempts to rescue the charismatic android, but thats only because they get separated early on and Data ends up hanging out with the Borg Queen. By the way, Picards self-sacrificial desire to save Data reveals a weakness in the script: After the Enterprise is set to self-destruct, Picard only has 15 MINUTES to rescue Data and escape the ship, but Picard is shown having a meaningful discussion with Lily (Woodard). Why sure! Another gem of the film is the revelation of the alien race at the end, which prompts a Wow reaction to fans of Star Trek (although erudite Trekkies undoubtedly knew it was coming).

There are other flaws, like the jarring and somewhat unconvincing excuse for going back in time and the questionable fiery confrontation between Picard and Lily. I say questionable because something about the sequence renders it slightly shaky; it may be the acting, the writing or some combination, but they needed to work out the kinks. Still, that scene has some good aspects, like Picards line: The line must be drawn HERE! and the build-up to it.

While I favor 1994s Generations to First Contact because of the fascinating story elements, e.g. the Nexus, and the potent subtext (see my review) and even marginally prefer the underrated Nemesis (2002), this doesnt take away from the fact that First Contact is a quality installment in the series, which gets better with repeat viewings despite its weaknesses.

The movie runs almost 111 minutes and was shot in the studio with location shooting at Angeles National Forest and Green Valley, Arizona (substituting for Montana).

GRADE: B",1448582400,,3211,5.049056603773585
864228,4,6304415346,"If it weren't for the Borg Queen ridiculousness, this would be a 5 star film.  The original concept of the Borg was of a leaderless collective, and that's a large part of what made them/it so terrifying.  When Rick Berman(or whoever was ultimately responsible) chose to betray Roddenberry's vision, the Star Trek franchise started to go downhill.  Deep Space Nine was the first example, and this was the 2nd.

All that being said, I think it's a very fun movie.  It feels less like an extended episode than Generations and Insurrection do, and also less over-the-top than Nemesis.  Hits the sweet spot in most regards.",1448323200,,618,4.838095238095238

So I thought a more modern sci-fi movie would do, like First Contact, which has been praised as one of the best Star Trek movies. But this movie was feeling almost as cheesy as Fantastic Voyage. At around 30 minutes, things turned quite violent. At 36 minutes I turned off the TV, grabbed my bowl of pop corn and beer, and went back to reading my current Star Trek book. I just wasted 36 minutes and $4 renting this movie. It left a bad taste in my mouth, but at least the popcorn was tasty. If this is one of the best Star Trek movies, I would hate to see the worst!

 This is by far TNG's best movie, & a very well written & put together sci fi epic action adventure through all time.

  Plot: Years after Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) survived his ordeal with the dreaded cybernetic alien monsters ""The Borg"", another super invading ship attacks the Federation & planet Earth, this time launching a massive time travel plot to destroy and enslave humanity's past.  With a new Enterprise starship, the crew travels back in time to a more primitive Earth to stop the Borg and the Borg Queen's dreaded plot.

 Picard acts as a Captain Ahab, on a personal blood feud mission to fight and destroy the Borg at all costs.

865198,5,6304415346,"no offense to J.J. Abrams' engaging reboot, but to this day First Contact remains not simply the very finest Star Trek film, but the absolute pinnacle of ALL THINGS TREK!!
the premise was on a knife edge. the story's ultimate destination is the first ever (official) visit to Earth from another species, the fall of the first domino which would lead to the United Federation Of Planets. it takes on such a weighty issue, such a significant building block in the roots of what Star Trek is all about, that it left itself no margin for error: ultimately, the film was either gonna rock or suck!
thankfully, it was one of those rare cases of there being plenty of room in one's mouth for what they bit off. the film effortlessly merges the greater sophistication of The Next Generation with the razzle-dazzle quality of it's predecessor. indeed, one of the things the film is often lauded for is making up for the ""action"" element that some found lacking in TNG. i myself never felt that - TNG did have it's showdown moments but has enough else going for it not to need to fall back on it, and it's certainly not as though the original series was nothing but fisticuffs - but enough people apparently feel differently that it's worth mentioning.
this is particularly noteworthy given that it's villainy is that of the Borg. i've review a handful of Doctor Who titles and mentioned more than once that, dearly as i cherish Doctor Who (which is probably my very favorite tv series), the Daleks are largely lost on me. my major issue is that the whole point of the Daleks is one-dimensional psychopathy. it doesn't make sense to keep revisiting the Daleks, because there's only really room for one story there. i must admit to the occasional similar feelings about the Borg, who share a few thematic elements. (although, inasmuch as they ""assimilate"" rather than ""exterminate"" they really have more in common with the Cybermen.)
but i find i can get around this grievance with the Borg for one simple reason: they looks like villains and/or monsters. you can know nothing whatsoever about what a Borg is and still be freaked out if you happened to find one in your vicinity. so even if i don't favor the Borg as a nemesis (i probably favor Q, for whatever it's worth), i can still comprehend and feel their inherent menace. but the Daleks have no such power over me, and why? because they're basically giant saltshakers. it's a textbook case of the devil in the details.
(i suppose it might also have to with a ""Borg Queen,"" played by Alice Krige. her introduction may well enhance the concept of Borg in the same what the similar introduction of Davros had strengthened the Daleks in 1974.)
but i digress...
the misguidedly Kirk-faithful have been known to describe Picard as a ""fuddy-duddy,"" but they're not likely to say as much after seeing First Contact. playing largely into memories of ""The Best Of Both Worlds,"" in which the Borg futilely attempted to convert Picard into a diplomat, we find our stalwart Captain driven to an obsession of Captain Ahab proportions which more than once hampers his usually impeccable judgment. this could very well be Picard at his most human.
on top of which, they managed to markedly improve on what just might be Classic Trek's most phenomenal blunder. asked to sum up the magic of that original series, William Shatner once said ""it's in the Genes."" what he meant by that was that Gene Roddenberry's creation was largely fleshed out by a writer named Gene Coon. Coon is often consider Roddenberry's ""right-hand man"" where D.C. Fontana was his ""girl Friday."" the Klingons and the Prime Directive are only the most obvious of Coon's contributions to the Trek canon. equally inspired was his creation of Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of warp drive...but sadly, Coon wasted the promising character on his single hokiest Trek script, ""Metamorphosis."" (basically, it's a space-anomaly love story. seriously, what the hell was Coon smoking when he came up with THAT?)
just to rub salt into the wound, the Cochrane presented there, played by one Glenn Corbett, was as rank a portrayal of as hollow a goody-two-shoes as you can ever expect to see.
here Cochrane gets the multifaceted presence as well as the solid story he should've had all along. it may be ""pushing it"" to suggest he's in his 60s at the time, but James Cromwell so adeptly improves on everything Corbett had done so clumsily that you don't find yourself pondering the enigma for long. his Cochrane is one of many conflicted, disillusions survivors of a recent war. even the landmark contribution he's about to make fills him with more cynicism than pride. what he doesn't realize, and what Cromwell has to project, is the damage and the ultimate healing of his idealism.
(is it simply that Cromwell has a meatier role in a stronger story than Corbett had been given? well, let's just say it doesn't hurt.)
all of which building up that seemingly unreachable plateau where science-fiction becomes one with it's first cousin, the space-opera (Flash Gordon, Star Wars). we get both razzle-dazzle action and exposition that doesn't feel like a history lesson in a truly faultless balance. the Trek ethos just don't get no tastier than this.
so resistance may or may not be futile, but if this sort of thing is your cup of tea, it's definitely not advisable.

(NOTE: i finally decided i should probably address the matter after all.
there is a groundless but persistent rumor - possibly spread by the same anarchists who are keeping Roger Moore from being officially recognized as the definitive James Bond - that the best is Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. that's certainly a fine film in it's own right, but to coin an understatement, pull-EEEEEESE!!
let's get one thing straight here and now: Khan is NOT a great villain. if we react to the character, it's a testament to Ricardo Montalban and Benedict Cumberbatch being great ACTORS. Khan himself is in fact about as generic a villain as you can get. to describe Khan as overrated would be like describing Hitler as ""somewhat hotheaded.""
and anyway, with all due respect to Kirk and Spock, the Enterprise-D crew is a much stronger and more eclectic ensemble, so it was always pretty much foregone that the pinnacle of the series would be one to showcase Picard, Riker, and Data. that's only common sense.
moreover, the best films to showcase the original crew are in point of fact no. 4, The Voyage Home, and no. 6, The Undiscovered Country. so Khan can realistically hope for fourth place at best.)",1419206400,2,6546,4.782685512367491

However, that is only part of the Borg's mission. Do the words ""Earth will be assimilated"" have any meaning to you? Look for a shock storyline from Data, the crew's resident android as well.

It does a fairly good job of pleasing trekkies and also those new to the franchise by filling in the early backstory of how the Federation began.

Another well-handled element of the story is Captain Picard's darkness from the past, especially his traumatic experience with the Borg in the TNG series.  The movie has a good balance between those into the series and newcomers and explains a lot without overdoing it.

865639,1,6304415346,"I'm a Star Trek fan from way back, so I hate to have to say that this is one of the dumbest movies I ever saw.

The Enterprise was sent off to patrol for Romulans in the Siberian Sector or whatever, a zillion quadrillion light years away, yet when they hear that the battle over by Earth is going badly, they are there like RIGHT NOW. I mean, I know warp drive is fairly fast, but if it was instantaneous then that changes the whole nature of Star Trek.

Then our heroes travel back in time and land on Earth, not too long after WW3 has ended. OK, humanity has been reduced to a handful of hippies living way out in the woods of Montana. My-oh-my Montana sure looks mighty warm and green in early April, don't it? We still got 2 feet of snow on the ground in Upper Michigan at that time of year... must be 50 years of global warming, I guess. Anyway, this head hippy has invented warp drive, motivated by an urge to get rich. I guess the 11 other hippies are going to pitch in together and buy his invention. Luckily there are more nuclear missiles laying around unguarded in this future America than there was in the former Soviet Union after the fall of communism, so that is what the warp drive spaceship is made from. I guess it does make sense if the world population is reduced to a handful of peace-loving hippies, who cares anymore about guarding nuclear weapons?

Meanwhile, events up in space make far less sense. The Borg have a collective intelligence. Each individual even has a chip inside that has the central plan of the whole group stored on it. Yet somehow this collective intelligence overlooks it when armed enemies walk quietly among them, as long as they don't actually shoot their weapons. Surely the collective, all-knowing brain of these super-advanced, super-intelligent aliens can foresee some teeny-tiny potential for danger from these weapon-carrying human enemies moving around them and their vital equipment? Especially when the leader of the humans is particularly well known to them from past interactions, hates their guts, and was just recently responsible for destroying two of their huge spacecraft? No, I guess not.

Our buddy Data has rigged the main Enterprise computer with a virtually impenetrable password. Do the super-advanced aliens use a USB wire or a serial connection or a parallel port to connect their own computer to it in an attempt to break the code? Do they just communicate directly from their super duper central brain by wi-fi? No, three bionic bad guys stand around with beers in hand, making bets on which one will solve it first by pushing buttons manually with their super-advanced fingers.

Then the hippie spaceship takes off. After somehow NOT burning up all the exposed nearby hippies with its conventional rockets, and NOT killing its crew with g-forces originally intended only for inanimate payloads, it goes into warp drive mode and passes about 1000 stars per second in traditional Star Trek fashion. They stop after maybe 30 seconds, turn around, and are amazed that Earth now looks no bigger than a marble. I guess maybe that means they went about 2 or 3 or 4 times as far away as what the Moon is, right? Funny there are so many stars to pass around our near neighborhood of space. Well that brief warp driving is picked up by the sensitive instruments of some passing Vulcans. But somehow they don't notice the huge starship Enterprise orbiting the Earth as they head smack accurate for the Montana hippie camp. Nor do they notice when the Enterprise crew beams up from 50 yards away from the Vulcan ship. Then the Enterprise cleverly sneaks around to the far side of the moon to engage their own warp drive, yet is in such a hurry to open up a time knothole and get home that the flash of that is visible even to the naked eye on Earth.

Whatever.",1391817600,4,3823,4.639586410635155
865640,4,6304415346,"""Star Trek: First Contact"" is the eighth movie in the apparently infinite Star Trek franchise. It features the heroes from the TV series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", most notably Captain Jean-Luc Picard, starred as usual by Patrick Stewart. Believe it or not, Stewart is actually an accomplished Shakespeare stage actor when not moonlighting in the Trekkie universe. The plot pits the evil, cybernetic creatures known as the Borg against humans and their allies.

After a failed attempt to destroy the Federation in the 23rd century, the indomitable Borg attack Earth by travelling back in time to the 21st century, when humanity was to weak to defend itself from an attack from outer space. To stop the cybernetic super-creatures, Picard and the Starship Enterprise follow suit. They end up in Montana on April 4, 2063, the very day before the ""First Contact"" between humans and Vulcans (a pivotal event in the Star Trek universe). The most humorous part of the film is when the Enterprise crew realizes that their childhood hero, trail-blazing scientist Zefran Cochrane, was really an alcoholic with a penchant for nude Hawaiian females!

It's probably the quasi-blasphemous character of ""Star Trek: First Contact"" that makes me like it. I suspect it's very deliberately un-Star Trek-like, to broaden the franchise to non-Trekkies. The nerd factor is almost zero, the action more straightforward than usual, and the film even includes self-referential humour, as when Cochrane asks the Enterprise crew if they are on ""some kind of star trek"", or when Lily says that ""the Borg sounds Swedish"". LOL!

I'm really too old to watch this kind of stuff, but oookay, I give it four stars. Live long and prosper...",1390003200,,1712,5.107142857142857
865641,5,6304415346,my family and I are star trek fans we love to watch the series and movies on our family nights,1388793600,,94,3.75
865642,4,6304415346,"I'm not a fan of JJ Abrams re-incarnation of Star Trek, not by a million miles. So if I want to have fun Trek time I have to look way back to previous generations (ironically this time the Next Generation) and to 1996's Star Trek: First Contact - the last truly great Trek movie.

Haunted by dreams of the techno-zombie Borg race calling to him Picard wastes no time (okay, maybe a little) in charging the Enterprise into a Borg battle with the Federation above the Earth. The cube is successfully destroyed, but the Borg manage to travel back to the mid-21st century, a time when Earth is fractured due from World War III, and try to prevent the first meeting between humans and aliens.

Zefram Cochrane is the man who makes that connection with his first ever warp drive flight, and he's not quite the squeaky clean hero that the Enterprise crew thought he would be. Meanwhile, with their escape pod destroyed, the remaining Borg slowly take over the Enterprise, with their as-yet-unseen Queen attempting to seduce security codes out of Data with promises of humanity (a clever reversal of Borg culture).

Naturalized Star Trek movies tend to fare better with audiences. Both First Contact and the Voyage Home are more accessible for non-Trek fans but still have a sense of adventure and a strong connection to the universe (pun intended). First Contact also receives a huge boost from Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score, which is his best Trek effort and certainly one of his best scores overall. The action is a little bit clunky (endless generic Enterprise corridor scenes get a bit tiresome) but the character chemistry is pitch perfect and there is a good variety in the excitement.

The Blu-ray looks good in 2.39:1 1080p, but I do believe that it would benefit greatly from a 4k remastering. Surely the series has enough fans for Paramount to justify it. The Dolby TrueHD sound fares a lot better and there are loads of extras. However, there is a commentary by Damon Lindelof (!) who was not involved with this film in any way (thankfully). Why this talent vacuum was invited to spout his opinions on a film far better than anything he could ever hope to be associated with is beyond me. It's like asking Ed Wood to make his own cut of Ben Hur.",1388188800,6,2253,4.681818181818182

865726,3,6304415346,"I don't blame others, it's just that the writing was not strong enough. The actors could do only so much for the characters assigned to them. The most important aspect of Star Trek types movies is the building up of the story, the natural progression to the scenes with smooth transitions. Although it's a sci-fi, I expected stronger, less cheesy show. The script did not seem to have been able to keep up with the changes and the resulting expectation of contenmporary audiences of Star Trek. Of course, those who subscribe to the nostalgic aspect of the TV series, will certainly find the movie OK, even great. But I could not help thinking Star Trek in this show has remained stagnant, tied up to the seventies or early eighties mind-set. Sorry, I could not be more specific, it's late in the night.

Good luck and ""Engage!""

While the movie isn't ""perfect,"" per se, if you want someone who isn't a ""trekkie"" to enjoy a Star Trek movie, this might be the one. Creepy and fast-paced, this will hold your attention to the end. The makeup of the Borg is outstanding, to say the least, and can be downright frightening to a child, and almost guaranteed nightmare-inducing to anyone younger than 13.

There is doubt with Starfleet since he was previously held captive by the Borg, but Picard proves just how human he really is when he offers to sacrifice himself to the Borg for another crew member (I won't say who just in case you haven't seen it).

The desperation to make things right in their future shows in every crew member, and all of humanity depends on the Enterprise and her crew.",1366761600,,565,4.311320754716981

I don't quite buy into the 'Trek Prophesy"" stating all the even numbered movies were good, while the odd-numbered ones were bad. In my humble opinion, First Contact stood alone in the field of Next Generation movies, with Generations trailing second in the North 40. The rest were mind pablum.",1363824000,,545,4.860215053763441

867067,5,6304415346,"I must say that this installment of the Star Trek movie series was extraordinary; it's rich in special effects, drama, suspense, and even action. What's more is that the storyline is superb and very interesting. In a nutshell, Borgs invade other worlds and assimilate the people to become Borgs. It's a mission to destroy mankind and rule the universe. Unless someone can travel through time and repair the damage, Borgs will rule. This movie is a cross between a Terminator film and Back to the Future. I may be stretching it some, but it feels like it in certain parts. I must also say that if one watches the Star Trek movies in order, it may be hard to get used to the new Enterprise crew, especially Patrick Stewart. However, as this movie moves along (as it does well), the characters develop and are respected. I especially like Alice Krige as the Borg Queen. She plays the part flawlessly, and is very seductive. Krige seems to be made for the sci-fi genre; she even stars in Frank Herbert's Children of Dune in 2003 as Lady Jessica, and does a stellar job. While I still love the Spock/Kirk duo, I still like the new crew and their overall acting. This movie gets my praise as one of the best movies of the franchise.

This movie brings us closer to understanding who the borg are, they command chain, etc. It also plays into the whole starfleet/federation history with the first warp flight. Very pleased with title, I know that some of the actors have aged a bit, but it still a gem on my collection.

PROS:
- Data added more wrinkles, but he still looks androidish.....maybe he needs an OS upgrade ;)
- The borg queen satisfies some of my theories.......a bee type structure.
- Dr. Crusher aged nicely
- 'bout time jody got some nicer implants........it's like 300 years into the future and they got him wearing a carburetor filter.
- Patrick Stewart, sir, you've aged well......you can still do another movie, please, please. Put everyone on a diet, get Dr. crusher some flowers/movie and tell data to get some work done.

CONS:
- Oh Diana Troy......Do betazoids ever go on a diet? and why did you had work done on your mouth? that smile makes me wonder about an evil character from some batman flicks.",1361836800,,1051,4.706521739130435

867595,5,6304415346,"Star Trek: First Contact became my favorite Trek film upon its initial theatrical release, and I think it's unlikely to surrender that status anytime soon, especially given the manner in which the entire franchise was rebooted in 2009. Everything comes together here in a perfect cinematic storm: Picard as Ahab pursuing the great white whale that is the Borg, Picard's relationship with Data, the trip back to the beginnings of the Trek universe and the accomplishment of Zefram Cochrane -- plus the classic acting skills of Patrick Stewart and direction of Jonathan Frakes, serving in that capacity for the first time. And, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's elegiac score. Touching on prime elements of the Trek mythology, demonstrating not only craft but art as well, this film holds up remarkably well after more than 15 years, seeming as fresh and engaging as when it first lit up the big screen. As always in any series or franchise, everyone has their favorite, and as I said, this is mine. Subjectivity plays a large role, of course, but I believe that even from an objective standpoint this remains the apex of the Star Trek experience.",1352851200,,1140,4.942708333333333
867596,5,6304415346,"Patrick Stewart is at his ""Shakespearean"" best here, with Picard's tortured psyche on display following his rescue from the Borg.  A finely crafted script draws parallels with ""Moby Dick"", with the Borg filling in for the white whale, and Picard, like Ahab, obsessed with vengeance; as Earth, itself is threatened by their ""resistance is futile"" maxim and power.  Jonathon Frakes directs with a deft hand...he knows these characters well.  (He has a Harvard degree, folks...no fool, that man!) The supporting cast is fine, as usual, with Marina Sirtis, as Troi stretching her comedy muscles in one scene.  The guest appearances, by James Cromwell and Alfred Woodard, also kick this film up a notch from the average Science Fiction space opera.  Finally, Stewart's finesse and passion in a Melville spouting (hee,hee) climactic scene with Woodard will have you mesmerized.  A truly fine film,  Watch it!",1351382400,,902,5.222222222222222

867720,1,6304415346,"I am amazed at the sheer number of positive reviews of this movie. I do not know if it is due to the sacred cow nature of the Star Treks series or if anybody truly watched this movie. Many reviewers have noted or nipped around the periphery of the films many flaws, but few have noted the most egregious errors therein.

In the beginning, the Enterprise is essentially exiled to the romulan zone since Picard has a borg history and he is seen as a wild card or something. While being something like 8000 light years from Earth, the crew is listening to the battle real time. Fine, maybe Starfleet has transwarp communication. Not a problem. However, after some soul searching and debate, the crew decides they need to leave their post and save Earth. Within 5 seconds, the Enterprise is in the midst of the battle having traveled an impossible distance in the blink of an eye??? Picard then miraculously knows precisely where to hit the cube (maybe he should have shared this knowledge with the rest of the fleet?) and the Borg are defeated. Everybody cheers, yay.

Onto the obligatory time travel (if the Borg had the ability, why not just use it in the first place with a full cube?), the Borg enter past Earth with the Enterprise in hot pursuit. Of course the sphere is destroyed, and all seems okay until the internal sensors fail to note intruders on board and the borg start to modify the interior of the Enterprise. Fine. However, the idea that the Borg will be nice if you don't poke them with a stick is absurd. There are like 5 of them against a crew of 400 and an entire planet eventually. You would think getting numbers would be one of their main priorities, but no they play nice as long as you don't irritate them.

There are too many other idiotic scenes and ideas like these in the movie to list them all. Suspension of belief is one thing, but when it gets insulting, that is something completely different.

Final comment is regarding the Moby Dick analogy. There is no comparison, your ship and world are under attack, Picard is on the defensive at this point. Ahab went looking for his destruction, Picard had it come directly to him and he acted appropriately. One star may seem a little harsh, but this movie was that bad.",1345248000,5,2245,4.522167487684729
867721,5,6304415346,"I have to own up up front that my favourite Star Trek series is TOS and while I did enjoy DS3 and the later seasons of Voyager a great deal somehow TNG didn't really do much for me.  Let's just say I'm much more excited about DS3 and Voyager coming in Blu-Ray than I am about TNG doing so.  With that out of the way, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot and after Star Trek 6 this is now my favourite Star Trek movie.  I truly hope that the recent alternate universe version of Star Trek finds a new younger audience but the really bad science throughout i.e. the manufactured black hole made me totally disinterested in that movie early on and so if I had to choose just three Star Trek movies to take with me to a desert island they would be ""The Undiscovered Country - Thearetical Release"", ""First Contact"" and ""Star Trek 1 - The Movie - Director's Cut"".

Regarding ""First Contact"", it looks great in 1080p and sounds good in Dolby TrueHD although I personally would have preferred a DTS-HD MA option.  Unlike too many other blu-ray releases, the BD-Live here is actually more than just a trailer of other movies to sell vehicle and I enjoyed the Star Trek IQ interactive quiz.  As for the content, we get a nice mixture of adventure and excitement as well as an homage to one of my favourite TOS episodes ""Metamorphosis"" where Cochrane is first introduced and a little drama with Picard which echoes another TOS episode ""Obsession"" as well.

Overall, this is a great Star Trek movie irrespective of series and both the picture and sound qualities are vastly improved over the standard dvd versions.

Highly recommended!",1342137600,,1632,4.508474576271187
867722,5,6304415346,Star Trek VIII: known as First Contact is about the borg leader being identified and them trying to stop First Contact after warp drive is intoduced by Z. Cocrin. This is a fast pace Star Trek Movie most of the movies by Star Trek have attempted to show many advancements in special effects. By showing off the vairous ships and docking in space. This is one of the better Star Trek movies it stays with a story line and show the charters and the relationships developed over the years. Jon Luke is one of the best Captains as he is a actor of the old style well educated in the acting arts. Kirk an ego maniac and Jane Way an over bearing captains. Jon Luke shows the emotional side of a captain. I like this movie also because it shows the charter flaws and strengths. One of the best Trek movies. Nemisis being the other.,1342137600,,824,4.32258064516129

And this, my friends, in my opinion- is the best of the Trek movies. And, on BluRay, it's wonderful effects and action sequences are even more stunning.",1339718400,,275,4.52
867724,5,6304415346,"OK, at least one of those five stars is just for Patrick Stewart, for whom I have considerable lust. I understand this is the second of the Next Gen series. I really must get the rest.

As hard-core fans know, Zefram Cochrane made his historical first warp flight on April 5, 2063.  Anyway, it turns out that the Borg took a time warp back to the day before in order to destroy Cochrane and his ship, thereby preventing first contact and making the population of earth easy to assimilate. Since this would destroy the time line on which the Enterprise exists, it has to be stopped.

So the Enterprise goes back in time (the method is a clever one; I won't reveal it), following the Borg to try to stop them and protect Cochrane and his warp ship. Try? Why do I say try? Captain Picard does not merely try things; he succeeds. How he succeeds is one very good adventure story. Complicated, as all time travel stories are, but it is possible to follow it.

Zefram Cochrane is a fascinating character; he even manages to get Deanna Troi drunk! The Borg Queen shows up, trying to seduce Data and then the Captain. Data even gets some real skin! But of course our intrepid heroes win in the end; otherwise they wouldn't exist in the 24th century, and we know they do",1336694400,,1261,4.422413793103448

867726,4,6304415346,"The Star Trek crew has gone back in time to the mid 21st century when following the third world war the first warp drive capable of powering a ship faster than the speed of light was invented. Thus, true exploration of deep space was made possible. However, there is a problem. The Borg want to interrupt this process, assimilate millions of humans, and thereby prevent the Vulcans from seeing the Human spaceship traveling through space at speeds faster than light and making first contact. Of course the Borg are defeated and the course of time is not changed. The final scene is the landing of the Vulcan ship and the meeting of the two peoples. This is another entertaining show for Trekies and other fans. There is humor provided in the character of the scientist who invented the Warp Drive. He is a rock and roller and does not fit the image which the 25th century humans have of him nor does he want to be put on a pedestal. After the first trip at warp speed and meeting the Vulcans he somewhat modifies his views.",1330128000,,1023,4.505376344086022
867727,4,6304415346,"Star Trek First Contact(1996) is one of the best Star Trek movies. I remember saving over $100 in cash so we could pay for our movie tickets and a pile of junk food. We searched six video stores in 1997 to buy a VHS copy. The crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise E must stop the Borg from conquering the Earth in the 21st Century. Captain Picard(Patrick Stewart) uses his Borg implants from the TNG episode The Best of Both Worlds to outwit the Borg. The Borg Queen(Alice Krige) tries to seduce Data by giving him human flesh. The away team led by Commander Riker(Jonathan Frakes) must make sure that Dr. Zephram Cochrane completes his warp flight or Starfleet will never exist. The tone of the film is dark and hopeless at times. Dr. Cochrane is a depressed alcoholic who lives in post-World War III Americana. The Borg make up is much more complex in this film and they can inject Borg nanoprobes into your bloodstream! Jerry Goldsmith and his son Joel composed the music score for the film. Cochrane's friend Lily(Alfre Woodard) befriends Picard as they are being chased by the Borg. There's a scene where Picard and Lily hide in a detective noir Holodeck program from two Borg drones. Dr. Cochrane is a rock and roll fan and we get to hear songs by Steppenwolf and Roy Orbison. Dr. Cochrane was featured on the original Star Trek, but the writers of this film created their own version of the character. Jonathan Frakes did a decent job directing the film and he also played Riker in the film. There's a suspenseful scene where Picard, Worf, and Lt. Hawk have to stop Borg drones from setting up a ""satellite dish"" on the hull of the Enterprise. The visual effects by ILM are first rate. Alice Krige played the hauntingly beautiful Borg Queen. She played a similar Borg Queen on Star Trek Voyager(1995-2001). I guess she's an homage to the sci-fi/horror film Lifeforce(1985). Star Trek First Contact got a PG-13 rating. It has some violence and Lily curses a few times! There's a cool scene where Picard loses his temper when Lily tells Picard to destroy the Enterprise. It was spoofed on South Park, I think.
Stock footage from Star Trek First Contact was used in a ""mirror timeline"" episode of Star Trek Enterprise(2001-2004).

I won't add much more except to say that the movie works so well because it blends the best of Star Trek - humor, action, and a morality play - into one package. The film has some genuinely funny moments, especially when Drs. Cochrane and Lilly are forced to adapt to 24th century technology and expectations.

Given its reputation as an action-packed battle against the Borg, there aren't that many action sequences in First Contact, but those that are included are deliberate, emotionally tense, and advance the plot. Jonathan Frakes (also William Riker) made some interesting decisions in portraying the fighting scenes. Often, the best moments occur just before or after the battles start, when the Borg seem indomitable. Unfortunately, the producers learned the wrong lessons from First Contact's success and overdosed on the action scenes in Insurrection and Nemesis (which actually has its moments, despite the action scenes).

Finally, First Contact contains two morality plays. The first focuses on Picard's thirst for revenge against the Borg. The second disabuses viewers of the notion that historical visionaries need have a saintly persona. Dr. Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive, comes across as a self-absorbed alcoholic. However, as viewers learn to readjust their expectations to fit the man, Cochrane also comes to realize that he can be a man and be part of history.

It's a shame that nearly 10 years after the last TNG film aired First Contact is really the only TNG film that stands as unanimously beloved. Despite what many producers and market analysts claim, it's not simply because First Contact uses the Borg and time travel as plot devices - although both work well. Rather, it's because it combines the best of Star Trek. Hopefully future Star Trek movies will learn these lessons.",1312156800,,1979,5.0830769230769235

A large portion of the credit for this film goes to director Jonathan Frakes, TNG's version of Leonard Nimoy when it comes to having a basic understanding of the material and a respect for the viewership. I'm convinced that if Paramount had stuck with the promotion of this film a little longer, it would have surpassed ST IV's box office totals.

We have some excellent character development, at least with regard to Picard, Data, Zefrem Cochrane, and Lily Sloane, no major contradictions in continuity (what does get contradicted is either acknowledged and done is such a way that it leaves open the possibility for an explanation to reconcile it with the established continuity, like the Borg Queen, or the point was conjectural anyway, like the date of Cochrane's first warp flight, and is close enough in this case).

867932,5,6304415346,"""Star Trek - First Contact"" is one of the best Trek films ever. I saw this in theatres back in '96. I love the cast of the original Star Trek (Kirk, Spock, etc) but for some reason, was never that invested in TNG series when it was on TV. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the pacing, the edginess, the overall action of this film, and Picard, Data, and the rest of the cast of characters grew on me (perhaps not enough to actually make me go back and discover TNG, per se, but it is fun.

The premise has to do with the Borg, a race of malevolent cybernetic drones who wish to collect and turn other lifeforms in the universe into part of their own collective. Apparently, Capt. Picard was assimilated into them at one point. The Borg Queen, very well played with a creepy vibe by Alice Krige, wants to travel back to the 21st Century and infiltrate the human race and stop the very first contact recorded between humans and extraterrestials, to try to undermine the inevitable change in human history.

James Cromwell gives a great performance as Zefram Cochrane, the scientist who invented Warp Drive, which enabled people to create ships to venture into deep space and beyond. He portrays him as a drunken, broken man, very flip and loose with a one-liner who at first has a hard time being convinced that hes destined to be a great, revered man due to his discovery.

The script moves at a breakneck pace, which the best Trek films do, and Jonathan Frakes' direction is flawless; he knows how to pace and gives us a cool sci-fi story with interesting heroes and villians we want to see. The Wrath of Khan definitely had this exact quality. The film's action is muscular and it help represents the best of Trek's storytelling qualities.

The action is quite engrossing, with the proper energetic and suspenseful mood.

Sadly, the dialogue leaves much to be desired. Once again,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ronald-D-Moore/dp/B0036EH3UC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ronald D. Moore</a>&nbsp;heavily relies on vacuous one-liners. Examples: ""I think it's time we took a little stroll,"" ""I believe I speak for everyone when I say, to hell with our orders,"" ""Reports of my assimilation have been greatly exaggerated,"" ""Assimilate this,"" ""Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do,"" ""I will make them pay for what they've done."" You can always tell when Moore is writing the script, because whenever someone needs to act gruff, they always start their speech with ""I want an explanation and I want it now,"" and end it with ""Now if you'll excuse me.""

The time travel idea was unoriginal by this point, but the bigger problem is that the movie never really shows you 21st century Earth the way that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Voyage-Home/dp/B000083C49/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Voyage Home</a>&nbsp;showed 20th century Earth. All you ever see on the planet surface is that one grimy camp in the woods. The Earth dwellers listen to 1950s rock and roll, which is really lazy characterization, because no one does that even now. On the other hand, I liked James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane. The movie does a pretty good job of showing his reluctance to be a hero, without taking the focus off the action. Cochrane contributes most of the light-hearted moments, and really redeems the parts of the movie set on Earth.

Alfre Woodard's character, however, is out of place. She's supposed to form some kind of bond with Picard. This is an action movie, meaning they can't have a romance, so I guess they're supposed to become good friends or something. But they are really badly matched. Picard is an educated, brooding intellectual, and Woodard plays a hard, scrappy, inarticulate fighter. They have no chemistry, it makes no sense that Picard would listen to this person that he just met and not to his senior staff. Plus, I always have trouble believing that people could start by pointing guns at each other and making death threats, and then quickly go on to form a deep friendship. I think it's a cheap exaggeration (and, in Moore's Battlestar Galactica, it happens in every single episode).

The movie is centered around Picard and his memories of his horrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/experience/dp/B000CCBCIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">experience</a>&nbsp;with the Borg. Well, give them credit for using a plot detail that is actually related to the show. Patrick Stewart shows Picard's anguish very well, you can really believe that this experience left him deeply wounded.

As for Data...well, at least he doesn't embarrass himself like in Generations. Clearly, Moore realized that giving Data emotions in Generations was a really dumb idea, because Data now has the ability to deactivate his emotions at will, meaning that you never hear about them throughout most of the film. But, since he still has access to them, the movie now needs to come up with a completely new way to make him yearn to be human. This time, it has to do with Data's lack of skin and tactile sensation. It's clever, but doesn't tug at the ol' heartstrings in the same way. Oh well.

The rest of the crew gets short shrift. Riker and Geordi spend most of their time hanging out with Cochrane down on the planet, where Cochrane has most of the spotlight. Troi and Dr. Crusher do absolutely nothing. Worf is at least tough, so he gets to come along on a dangerous mission and shoot some enemies. Also, because he's an impulsive Klingon, there just has to be one scene where he flies into a passion and threatens to kill Picard, the man he respects more than anyone else. Why, why must Ronald D. Moore always turn all the emotions up to eleven?

As villains, the Borg are scary but faceless (well, that's the point). The movie has a few great ""gotcha"" moments when the Borg are starting to infest the Enterprise, and later as the crew tries to fight their relentless advance. But the producers wanted someone with more personality, who could hold an audience the way villains like Khan did, so now the Borg turn out to have a sultry Borg Queen who is capable of individuality. This makes the Borg less interesting as an idea -- the reason why they were so shocking in the show was because they were so different from humans as to be incomprehensible. But, I have to say that Alice Krige, as the Queen, is not bad. In her own way, she does hold the audience.

TNG doesn't translate to film as well as the original series, because it's more of an ensemble show, it's not meant to focus on the captain this much. First Contact, unfortunately, doesn't know what to do with most of the crew, and interprets TNG as the Picard and Data show. But it also introduces some pointless new characters, who use up screen time that could have been used for somebody who had more character development from the series. Still, it works as a Picard story as well as an action flick. And, of course, it's a million times better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/B00005JLRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>.",1290729600,3,6090,5.626361655773421

868069,5,6304415346,"""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", the first and most famous sequel series to the classic 1960s TV series ""Star Trek"", ran on TV from 1987 to 1994, accumulating a large fanbase and tremendous critical acclaim, particularly for years 3 through 6.  Following the end of the program, it moved to take the place of the TOS film series, which had wrapped up with ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" in 1991.  1994's ""Generations"", a passing-of-the-torch film, was a middling endeavour.  ""First Contact"", released in 1996, represented the highpoint of the new film series (and, of the run of the original ten films, is at least in the top two, in contention for first).  With series co-star Jonathan Frakes, the TV show's best actor-turned-director, at the helm, the production crew delivers a great sci-fi action film, one that simultaneously manages to do quite a bit with the main characters.  It has rereleased on DVD and Blu-ray following the success of Star Trek XI (or just plain ""Star Trek""), and now in much more convenient packaging (and also, I note, with the numeral ""VIII"" added in, something that they pointedly avoided using on initial release).  Spoilers follow.

""Generations"" ended with the Enterprise-D being destroyed in battle, allowing the filmmakers to introduce a new and more film-friendly ship and sets, the Enterprise-E, which is indeed a lovely looking piece of work.  There are a number of other updates here, significantly a new wardrobe for the cast that is probably the highpoint of 24th century fashion (later adopted by ""DS9"" for the rest of that series).  Similar to ""The Wrath of Khan"", ""First Contact"" is a sequel of sorts to an episode of the TV series, in this case ""The Best of Both Worlds"", the season three/four two-parter that really pushed the show to superstar status.  Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Sir Patrick Stewart) has recovered from being assimilated by the cybernetic Borg, but he is still on some level traumatized by the experience, and when a new Borg invasion begins, he defies orders to take the Enterprise to the front lines - said front line being Earth, as the new Borg cube has cut through Starfleet with ease.  Picking up Worf (Michael Dorn) from the wrecked USS Defiant, they soon find themselves in the 21st century, where the Borg plan to abort first contact between Humans and alien life.  While Commander Riker (Frakes) leads a team planetside to get the spaceship ready for its rendezvous with destiny, Picard and his allies on the ship confront the Borg, who have taken root within.

The Borg are arguably Star Trek's greatest villain race (at least, they were at this point; ""Voyager"" would, as with many other things, drive them into the ground through overuse and villain decay), and they were probably never more effectively used than here.  Much like Starfleet, they've been redesigned to look more more sinister, with a tremendously scary new method of assimilating enemies.  The Borg Queen (Alice Krige) was a controversial element to introduce, but I think she makes sense as the synthesis of the Collective's consciousness (""Voyager"", of course, would overuse her too), and the dynamics between her, Picard, and Data (Brent Spiner) are great.  Data, whose quest for emotions was played for laughs in ""Generations"", is treated properly here, and his scenes here really progress his character (unfortunately, the later films would abandon this without explanation, one of their bigger problems).  The epicentre of the drama is Picard, of course, and Stewart does perhaps his best work here, with Picard's quest for revenge gradually overtaking Picard's normally level-headed disposition.  Krige makes a great villain, and the two major civilian characters, Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) and Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) are well-handled; Cochrane is an especially interesting and funny take on the reality behind supposedly great men.

I remember picking up a sci-fi magazine during the '80s or '90s (I forget which) which listed ST-TNG as the greatest sci- fi series of all time and ST-TOS at #12!!!  Thankfully this magazine is no longer in business.
As for the Star Trek movies, the critics went bananas over this film.  One actually said it was the best Star Trek film since ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.""  Better than ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" and ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country?""I don't think so!  (This is almost as silly as a film critic in a moment of temporary insanity who proclaimed ""Never Say Never Again"" as the best Bond film since ""From Russia With Love."")
Anyway this film got near-unanimous great reviews and still grossed less than $100 million in the U.S.
I've always felt this film to be overrated.  However I must admit to enjoying the blu-ray transfer I watched last night.  The picture and sound quality are excellent.  I just wish Paramount would stop using the same special features that are found on the deluxe dvds of these films.
As for the film itself, there are still many things I do not like about it.  I cannot stand James Cromwell's performance as Zephrame Cochran, the inventor of Warp Drive.  I find him to be an uncharismatic and unlikeable actor.  (Cochran was portrayed by Glenn Corbett is a 2nd season Star Trek-TOS episode, ""Metamorphosis.""  I'm not sure if he was still alive when this film was made, however he was a much better looking and likeable actor than Cromwell.)  I'm also not a great fan of Patrick Stewart, in T-shirt, doing John McClane- like stunts at the end of this film.
I did enjoy the scenes with the Borg a bit more than previously (especially the scenes outside the Enterprise.)  I'm still not a great fan of the Borg Queen however.
I still think the best Star Trek:TNG film is ""Nemesis,"" which was surprisingly the biggest flop in the series.  And while, as stated previously, I've never been a great fan of this film, I think I can now jump it over ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" and ""Star Trek Generations.""  (I still believe ""Star Trek Insurrection,"" the film following this one to be the worst in the series.)
I do feel that poetic justice has taken place with the great success of the ""Star Trek"" film this summer, people continue talking about Kirk, Spock and McCoy and Captain Picard and the crew of Star Trek-TNG have basically been forgotten after only four films.

The movie takes place in I think 2063, after the 3rd world war, and most governments have been screwed. The Borg have attacked that time to assimilate earth in the past, to prevent them from making ""First Contact""(with Vulcans that is) So the crew of the Enterprise have to fight off the Borg while helping the man that made first contact to succeed in executing the first ever warp drive. That character Mr Cochran is very funny, it's like in TNG's time he was portrayed as a HERO, yet in his mind, he's in it for the money, booze, and girls.

The plot is very interesting. It brings back the Borg, the baddies of the universe.  Through a series of events, the Borg time travel ( Yes I know, in Star Trek, they travel through time like we change socks) to the past and plan to make the population of Earth all Borg. Well, Captain Picard and crew just can't let that happen. They travel back the same way the Borg did and stop them.  It seems that the Borg want to stop ""First Contact"" (that's when we met aliens for the first time) and we'll never make friends in the universe and it's easy pickings for the Brog to turn all of us into them.  That's pretty much all I want to say on what happens, I don't want to give to much of it away.  Just trust me, it's fantastic!

This movie has it all.  It's chuck full of suspense, jaw dropping stunts, and some really interesting plot twists and some old fashion action.

I really liked the story line of Picard's obsession. It was linked to Moby Dick and Captain Ahab.  This just adds to much to the story line. If you didn't know there were two epys of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Picard was taken by the Borg, and was made into one of them.

Now for the blu ray aspect.  Its' phonominial!!!  It has fantastic sounds.  The sound is so crisp and clear, again, it adds a lot to the movie. The visuals are out of this world. Everything is crystal clear and the images are incredibly sharp. The view can't help but to be drawn in.  I just have one small issues with it. The menu screen could have been so much better. It was just the Star Trek symbol, and then it looked liked you are in warp drive in space, going around the symbol.  I think that they really dropped the ball on this one. They could have done so much for the menu screen. They could have had the new Enterprise, the Borg, Data, the Queen Borg, the Borg Ship, anything. Anything would be better than nothing, and I feel that's what they have for the menu.

People who vote high on this movie I'm convinced are doing so due to the Star Trek name to save face.  I'd love to rate this movie highly but this was a bomb in every way.  Had it not been for the special effects and outstanding high tech sets, this movie would have really been exposed as horrendously bad.  It's like putting large boobs on a homely women and expecting people to think she's a model because of the size of her breasts.

One interesting note, a guy brought this movie over for me to see claiming it was one of the better of the Star Trek NG movies.  I was forced to watch this piece of garbage for two hours of my life because if it, and our friendship is now over.  This movie ruined a perfectly good friendship.",1259452800,3,1082,4.316831683168317

For example, there was this piece of ""fuzz"" that was on the bottom of the screen while Picard and Riker were having their first chat (the scene where he's got Berloiz's opera really loudly in his Ready Room) that looked like it was caught during the film transfer. Seriously, it was huge!

Otherwise, it's not too bad. The sound's loud enough to get the neighbors upset with you, and the film makes you forget some of the weaker TV shows and the last movies featuring The Next Generation cast.

With some small exceptions to the story line I thought it did a wonderful job of reintroducing all the main characters from the original tv series. The actors were perfect for the rolls they were selected to play and the acting was believable. The special effects were first class and the music super. I look forward to the continuing saga of Kirk, Spock and the gang as they navigate about the galaxy finding new adventure and supplying us, the viewing audience, with excitement, drama and vicarious thrills.",1258934400,,594,4.833333333333333
868160,4,6304415346,"This was probably the only Next Generation movie I really liked.  I mean, it's awesome.  I thought it was the only one that was as good as the television show.  I would put this at the top tier of all Star Trek movies, just below ""Wrath of Khan"" and the 2009 reboot.  It still remains one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time.  Now the film is not perfect.  There are a few problems I had with it.  Most of those problems have to do with continuity issues between the movie and the TV show.  I'll get into those later in the review.

The movie centers around the Borg, the half-machine, half-organic aliens from the series.  Considering that they were probably the most popular villians from the series, it made sense to make them the villians of the new movie.  The plot involves the Borg going back in time to the year 2063.  This is supposedly the year when we first invent the warp engine and meet the Vulcans for the first time.  The Borg want to stop that from happening, and they want to enslave the human race.  The Enterprise follows them back through time and blow up the Borg ship.  The Borg beam over to the Enterprise and begin assimilating the crew.  So you've got a movie that has the Borg, and time travel.  Doesn't get any better than this.

At this point the movie branches off into two plot lines.  One plot involves Picard and most of the crew trying to defeat the Borg on the ship.  The other involves Riker and the rest of the crew on the planet helping Zephram Cochrane, the man who is supposed to invent warp speed.  He is unsure about his calling, and Riker has to convince him to go through with his flight.  Both of these plots are excellent.  In fact, each one by itself is good enough for a whole movie.  So my question is, why didn't they make one movie about the Borg, and another movie about someone trying to screw up the timeline?  Putting both these plots in one movie made the movie awesome, but it made this movie hard to top.  Of the two Next Generation films that came after this movie, neither one of them measured up tp this one.  Maybe for the later movies, they should have used villians from the series again.  But that's a whole different review.

About halfway through the movie, the villian of the movie is introduced.  The Borg queen.  This is my only big problem with the movie.  On the show, it is established that the Borg exist as one consciousness, entity, and there are no leaders or subordinates.  So all of a sudden, they have a queen?  On the behind the scenes stuff, one of the writers or producers said that not having a main villian worked on the show, but it didn't really work in a movie.  I can kinda see where they were coming from, but they really needed to follow the continuity of the source material.  The Borg queen just makes no sense.  The fact that she exests makes no sense, and most of her dialogue makes no sense.  They say that she was on the ship with Picard when he was turned into a Borg and the TV episode ""Best of both Worlds"".  At the end of the episode, the Borg ship is destroyed.  If the queen was supposedly on it, then she would have been destroyed as well.  When Picard comments on this, she responds with ""You think in such 3-dimensional terms"".  What does that mean?  Is that supposed to have a meaning?  Whatever.

But thankfully, the Borg Queen doesn't have all that much screen time.  So if you can just get past her annoying presence and the continuity errors, you should enjoy this movie.  In fact, this is one of the three Star Trek movies that I think could appeal to mainstream audiences (the other two being voyage home and the 2009 reboot).  Most of the charcter development is great, the action is great, the special effects are great, almos teverything about this movie is great.  If this movie had had a strongerr villian, this would probably be my favorite Star Trek movie, even better than Wrath of Khan and the 2009 reboot.",1258761600,,3930,4.376731301939058

Besides I already had the first 7 films in the same style packaging so I didn't wanna mess that up. So I went the bargain route and got the original Special Editions of the TNG films to round out my collection and I couldn't be happier to finally have the full collection. Granted, the box for my copy of ""Nemesis"" is a little beat up, but the content plays okay, so I can't complain since it only cost me like 3 bucks plus shipping.

I picked up the disc yesterday and watched it last night. The quality of this bluray disc is stunning! The clarity is top quality and the color vibrance is amazing, without looking fake or hyped. I didn't notice any unusual artifacts like edge enhancement nor any noise reduction - I watched it on my 52"" Samsung LCD but didn't get right up at the screen to examine for these things. But from where I was sitting it looked flawless. The sound is also fanstic and what I noticed the most is that the movie doesn't suffer from the irritating dramatic volume changes. Yes, during action scenes things get louder as they normally should but it wasn't so much that I had to ride the volume control, which is hugely irritating and becoming more common in today's new releases. If you still don't get what I mean I'm referring to the dialog being much lower in volume to the tremendously loud action scenes. Anyhow, this disc doesn't suffer from that, yet there is still a good amount of bass to put you into the feel of the action scenes.

I highly recommend this disc!

I'll also go ahead and say that I have always been an avid fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, so it follows that I will obviously like their feature films.  I'm biased, in other words, so stop reading now if you want an objective review.

Despite how well the movie was received by critics, how much money it made at the box office's opening weekend, or any other quantitative method for computing a film's success, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie immensely.  Sure, the destruction of the borg ship in the beginning seemed a little too easily handled and the subsequent time travel to the past (and back to the future at the end) also seemed a little too conveniently done.  Especially given how difficult it has been in Star Trek's past to time travel, one is left to wonder why, after discovering how easy it is by the end of this film, Starfleet doesn't use it all the time, pun intended.

Despite those two plot conveniences, this really is a good action-adventure.  Not very much technobabble, for those who hate it in the series and earlier films, and it's also quite accessible for anyone new to the franchise as a whole.  One might argue that watching the episodes ""The Best of Both Worlds, Parts I & II"" are necessary before seeing this film, but I disagree.  Just as seeing ""Space Seed"" (ST:TOS) isn't necessary before watching ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"" it does, admittedly, offer more flavor and backstory.

There are many well played intense actions scenes between Picard and the Borg (his arch nemesis).

868279,5,6304415346,"This movie soars above the previous outing in film-making quality, writing, action and just about any way you can think of. It is also much darker, contributing to this outing becoming the first movie in the Star Trek series to receive a PG-13 rating.

Taking a page from the lesson learned from The Wrath of Khan, they decide to bring back a known foe: the Borg. Granted, each time we meet the Borg, it is a different group, thus not necessarily qualifying as a simple recurring villain, but given the hive-minded nature of the Borg, it makes little difference. They are all basically programed to behave the same. However, while TWoK showed Captain Kirk being pursued by a man who felt wronged by him (even quoting Captain Ahab in his last moments before dying), here we see our beloved Captain Picard take on the role of Ahab in his personal quest for vengeance against the cybernetic whale that had crippled him so many years ago. (Again, ""Moby Dick"" is brought up specifically in this movie too.)

As a first motion-picture outing for director Jonathan Frakes (who had directed several episodes of the series), this more than satisfies. In coming up with a directorial style for this movie, he watched movies like Alien, Jaws, 2001, Close Encounters, etc. and it shows. He more than competently creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere, yet still manages to appropriately work in bits of humor (a standard of Star Trek).

The  movie is a perfect example of studio executive logic: Some of the highest rated episodes of the series had the Borg so they have to be in it. Then the highest grossing Star Trek movie up to that point had time travel which was also popular during the series. I know! Make a movie with the Borg and time travel! What you end up watching is a contrived mess that only scarcely resembles what you fell in love with on the small screen. The plot, sprinkled with heavy-handed hammy humor, is a self-congratulatory romp through Star Trek history that moves so briskly even the plot holes can't keep up. Worst of all, 'First Contact' marked the beginning of the ""stupidification"" of the Borg. The scary metaphor of relentless cultural conformity and the embodiment of our techy fears were replaced by what essentially amounts to zombies. From outer space. Then there's the explicable but out-of-character, and doubly-contrived Picard-with-an-Ahab-complex that drives the movie. Simply lazy. Just like the notion that all ships can now travel through time at will. No goofy ""temporal anomolies,"" wormoholes, or slingshots around the sun. Just make it so!

The movie is not a total loss. It is fun to see your ""family"" again even though they all don't act like you remember, and the peformances of James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard are good. The movie has more heart than its subsequent soul-less sequels and it is a decent superficial Star Trek adventure; albeit one with nothing to say. Star Trek stopped commenting on the events of the day or cultural matters and decided to sell out to the lowest common denominator. 'First Contact' represents a continuing slide into mediocrity and irrelevance that ultimately doomed the franchise. It's okay, it's watchable, you might even enjoy it.

The Borg finally get blasted out of space.  Everything's going fine until a big Borg ball comes flying out towards Earth, spitting out ""tachyon particles"" which we Trekkers know means time travel.  Yummy.

The better aspects of this film:  What would you do with a historic figure?  Would you tell him all about his future exploits?  Or when you find out he likes to drink moonshine, '60s rock, and only invented Warp Drive for the money, what would you think of him then?  Kinda like finding out George Washington had black slaves, that kinda thing.

Deanna Troy getting tipsy was fun; Data apparently being lured by the Dark Side (sex); and Picard's obsession with the Borg being in line with Melville's obsession with Moby Dick (plus a quote from the book).

Nice direction from Frakes and a good way to wrap up the Next Gen.

868400,4,6304415346,"That's the key question one should ask himself when viewing ""Star Trek:  First Contact.""  In this first solo outing for the TNG crew, Picard and the gang find themselves facing off against the highly popular villains called the Borg.  Having been defeated every time they've battled the Enterprise, the Borg devise a plan to travel back in time to stop a key event in Earth's history and then (big shocker) assimilate everybody.  In a heated and action-packed space battle, the Borg jump through time with the Enterprise E hot on their tale.  The Borg cube is destroyed almost immediately, but this is only the beginning of a fast-paced and highly enjoyable action/dramatic yarn that goes so far as to question a particular crewmember's sanity.

While he isn't at the helm of the Enterprise in this film, Jonathan Frakes does call the shots behind the camera.  He takes the screenplay crafted by Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore and blends just enough action into the script to keep the story moving at a good clip.  As much as I enjoy TNG, I do have to say that the series was often weighed down by long and drawn out moments of dialogue.  Frakes puts the brakes on these sequences at just the right time.

Patrick Stewart delivers a solid performance as Picard.  Matching him scene-for-scene is Alfre Woodard in an excellent performance as a fish-out-of-water aboard the Enterprise.  James Cromwell proves once again that he deserves bigger roles than the ones he usually gets.  Brent Spiner is sufficient as always as Data and the rest of the crew do an excellent job as well.

The music and special effects are also very good.  As stated before, the space battle sequence is amazing.  There's also some zero-gravity action as well.

This two-disc set is an excellent addition to any Trek fan's collection (or, in this case, collective).

868401,4,6304415346,"Enjoyable, action-filled, but if you haven't watched the series, you might be a bit at sea.

So let's see: um, Picard once got bitten by a cyborg race called the Borg and developed Space Lime Disease, and oh yeah, Warf is on that spin-off show Deep Space Nine, so that's why he's on that little ship (with nobody else from that show, apparently).  Oh, and there's this guy named Zephram Cochrane from the ORIGINAL series who created warp drive, and later became immortal, sort of.

But if you can chew through that or ignore it, there's the nasty Borg queen, played by Alice Krige with scene-stealing glee, nifty space battles, fun with the holodeck, mercy killing, and the always effective Alfre Woodard.  And don't forget James Cromwell, just a few years after that little piggy movie got him a much better agent.

Jonathan Frakes, (Commander Riker) directed, quite capably.  The film  moves along at a nice pace, rarely stalling (usually only when Patrick Stewart is having a ""SERIOUS ACTING!"" moment).  There's the story on the ship, battling the Borg, and the story on the planet, where half the crew is trying to get the reluctant Cochrane up in the air in his rickety warp ship, on schedule.  Balancing the two stories is really quite a feat.

Compare the editing and cutting between the two stories with Lucas's dismal Episode One: I would have gladly killed little Anikin, Jar-jar, Amidala and her bully-boys myself just so we could get back to the climactic light saber duel.

868402,4,6304415346,"Another of my ""retro-reviews"",""Star Trek:First Contact"" is by far and away the best of the new generation movies made.
The movie sets the mood and pace almost right from the get go. The Earth is being assaulted by a Borg cube ship but the Enterprise is told to stand down and is sent to a remote section of the quadrant to do some star mapping. This step has been apparently taken by the Earth governing hierarchy due to Picards' assimilation by the Borg years before.
The battle is listened to closely by the bridge crew and all is not going well. When Picard cannot take anymore he hurries back to Earth to help. They arrive in the nick of time and help to destroy the cube ship. But a Borg escape pod gets away and hurls earthward. The Enterprise pursues and goes through the same time portal the escape pod creates. They are taken back to the year 2063 and it seems the Borg are here to stop Zephram Cochran(inventor of warp drive)from taking his first flight(due to be the next day) and conquer Earth itself;to change the future for their own purposes.
The Enterprise closes in on the pod which is firing Earthward and destroys it. Unbeknownst to the crew though,a party of Borg transported aboard the ship,seconds before its' destruction. The Enterprise crew lands on Earth and meets the warp drive inventor and assists him in every way possible so he makes the all important flight. Besides the flight being a first test for warp drive it will also lead to a first contact situation with intelligent alien life which in turn will lead the Earth on its' path towards permanent space exploration.
During all this time with Cochran the crew slowly realizes and starts to come to grips with the Borg threat aboard the Enterprise.
Several crew members are taken hostage and assimilated including Data. Picard eventually gives himself to the Borg who are lead by a queen.
It's touch and go but Picard with Data's help,eventually defeats the queen and her coterie. The ship is saved from destruction and Cochrans' historic flight takes place as it should with the positive resultant effects.
The movie rarely stops for a moment as the pace is relentless and it keeps you focused all the time. All of the new gen crew are there who do a good job playing the characters to a tee from the TV show and even DS9 is given a nod as Worf comes aboard after having lead an almost fatal attack against the Borg on the Defiant. The queen Borg is played by Alice Krige who gives a great performance with just the right amount of omnipotence and menace coupled with a good measure of faux sincerity in her voice and body language.
There are some very minor drawbacks here and there in this film. The biggest one however is Zephram Cochran himself. Anyone in the least familiar with Star Trek,and the original series in particular,knows  about Cochran. Captain Kirk met Cochran on a far away planet in one of the better known eps. There are slight differences in detail from the Cochran of Picard and the one of Kirk. Not the least of which being their physical appearances and mannerisms. There is very little if anything one can match up between the two actors or their characters,only that we are supposed to believe that they are one and the same Cochran. The writers knew they were taking a chance with this aspect and while over-all plot wise it works,with me there's always that thing in my head that keeps saying:""No,these are just NOT the same people"".And that always creates that ""bump"" in an otherwise smooth ride.
Technically the print is crisp and clear and the transfer was very good. The two disc set here has alot of features to offer and should satisfy all the Trek fans.
In conclusion this is overall a really good movie and a worthy entry in the Star Trek cannon. Its' plot is quick and well thought out and the acting is spot on throughout and Ms. Kriges' performance as a Borg queen is a standout. If your a Star Trek fan this movie deserves a spot on your shelf. It's just too bad the follow ups to this didn't come close in script and execution.",1211068800,,4054,4.568681318681318
868403,5,6304415346,"I watched the original episodes and watched most of TNG and when they ended. I felt DS9, Voyager and Enterprise were nothing but a bunch of spin off meaning the title (star trek being used in each of them). I didn't understand DS9 and Voyager at the time and didn't follow Enterprise.
  It wasn't until later when I've collected them all! Every single star trek episode and movie to date that I realized it's telling one big story.
  Which bring me to this movie. I now consider this film being the first episode in the story I mean. I'm sure a lot of you have seen it already if you haven't you won't understand the series Enterprise. I HOPE THIS GRABS YOUR GUYS ATTENTION!!

But the sinister Borg race with their sexy leader (Alice Krige) have a dastardly plan to go back in time so they can enslave the human race on Earth in the 21st century, the Enterprise follows them as their only chance in stopping the borg is to find the creator of warp drive known as Zefram Cochran (James Cromwell) and his assistant Lily (Alfe Woodard) and stop the Borg's plan.

The greatest ST sequel since ""Wraith of Khan"" and yet the most satisyfying! The acting and special effects are fantastic, the storyline is well constructed and director/actor Jonathan Frakes has really made the movie into one of the best sci-fi movies ever. Ms. Krige is quite a dish for a cybernetic villainess in this movie, Jerry Goldsmith's score soars high as one of his best and is the best film of the Next Generation  part of the ST franchise, a real winner in my books.

This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent sound and picture that is better then the original DVD all the way! extras include audio commentaries, Text Commentary from Denise and Michael Okuda, Teasers and Trailers, Scene deconstruction, A tribute to Jerry Goldsmith and featurettes.",1203465600,,1382,4.872340425531915

Still, my general criticism of these films remains--they all feel like expanded episodes of the TV series.  I really wish they had taken the opportunity to take these characters into new territory like the Original Series films did.  Even if they split up the crew, I'm sure that a talented writer could have devised stories that would have required them to come back together every couple years or so.",1199232000,,697,4.931623931623932

After viewing, I was thrilled that this film did just that, and then some. I really liked this one, its one of the best in the entire Star Trek film series. Again, the important thing is that the plot to the basic story to the movie is good. The crew has to travel back in time to stop the Borg from assimilating the human race in the past, and make sure that humans make ""first contact"" with alien lifeforms. Though, the whole time travel thing has been done a lot, when done right, it still works. But I do think that a bit of this story is borrowed from the original Star Trek episode ""Assignment: Earth"". Again, I'm not a big fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation series, and I'm not too familiar with the cast, but I knew about the Borg storyline from the show. And it really does make for a good motion picture. The film starts quickly and flows nicely. Cast member Johnathan Frakes directs this one, and does a good job. And the acting is as good as you're gonna get in these films. Overall, this one is definitely worth watching and owning. Again, its one of the best in the Star Trek movie series.",1193097600,,1234,4.323275862068965
868514,4,6304415346,This was one of the best Star Trek movies.  It's exciting and brings so many of the characters together.  Of course when the Enterprise is fighting the Borg it is always interesting.  I've enjoyed this movie over the years.,1193011200,,223,4.666666666666667
868515,2,6304415346,"This was a B-grade zombie attack movie set in the Star Trek universe.  Plenty of menacing looks and slow, inevitable walks towards assimilation by the Borg.  The characters were either unlikable or uninteresting, except for the Borg Queen.  The only parts of the story worth merit were the interactions between Data and the Borg Queen and maybe, just maybe between Picard and Lily.

And oh so many plot holes!!  All right, so you're the Borg, attacking Earth and taking over the only hostile spaceship in the area.  Oh, look, there are 3 armed crew coming our way while we try to place a deep space call for reinforcements.  That's okay, just ignore the humans.  Hmmm, one of our enemy is pressing a few buttons on a console nearby --- give him a menacing look and attack him.  Gosh, one of our own just got killed...no problem, just keep doing your work and ignore them.  Oh, but wait, another enemy is pressing a button, let's send 1 (and only 1) more Borg to attack that guy.  And so on.  The Borg have always been single-minded in purpose, but this movie reduced the Borg to mindless zombies.

Obviously the collective is aware of the threat posed by humans...or at least humans of their century...since they are going to great lengths to go back in time to assimilate Earth when humans are most vulnerable.  So if the collective is smart and can plan ahead, why is it ignoring any humans that walk by with lowered weapons?  Why does pressing buttons get them so excited but only 1 of them react?  According to this movie, Borg are highly strategically challenged and it is a wonder they assimilate any advanced race.  Would you send only 1 cube spaceship to attack your enemy's homeworld?  Borg already know the capabilities of the humans since they've attacked Earth before.  Obviously, they have the resources since they have assimilated thousands of worlds.  Why not send 10 or 100 Borg vessels?  (That would be a very exciting battle on the epic scale of Star Wars.)  If they wipe out Earth's defenses, they wouldn't have to go back to the past to assimilate humans when they are weakest.

And by the way, why did they decide to go back to the past at the moment humans developed warpdrive capabilities?  If they are interested in a strategic victory, they should attack Earth when humans are living in caves.  If they are interested in technology, they should assimilate Earth during modern times to gain the most knowledge.

The ending was anticlimactic, too.  What happens to the Borg now that their Queen is dead?  I guess this is just another ""it never happened"" kind of time travel movie, rather than advancing the Star Trek universe in any meaningful way.  The first contact by the Vulcans at the end was mildly interesting, but lacked the emotional appeal of say, Khan dying explosively or Spock returning to us reborn.

This movie just defies common sense and is boring to watch.  The plot was riddled with holes, the action was stale, and the ending anticlimactic.  I expect a zombie attack movie to be bad, but Star Trek movies should be much better than this.  This is nowhere near the number of stars people are giving it.",1192406400,7,3144,4.668488160291439

There is so much you can do with the star trek franchise and THIS film proves it. It's the first time they have the screen all to themselves (which is to say without the old crew) and it's the only time that they do a decent job of carrying on the torch that was passed to them by the original crew.

First Contact has some of the best actors around. James Cromwell and Alfrie Woodard are positively wonderful additions to the Star Trek phenomena. There were just too many questions left. Too many loose ends left untied. And too many times when I said ""so what."" during the show. The crew exists as cardboard cutouts of their television personas.

The bonuses however, are hardly worth purchasing the two disc collector's edition.  I understand that the movie was filmed before the days of DVD and the producers didn't go into the project expecting to hand over hours worth of bonus material.  It shows.  All of the extras felt like they scrounged together whatever behind the scenes footage they could find and tried to build little documentary segments out of it.  In my opinion, it failed spectacularly.

I, personally, was hoping for extras about the Borg Queen.  Her makeup, her art direction.  There is some of that, but not a lot.  The only mention of her makeup is in passing and there are no behind the scenes footage of the makeup process at all.

All in all, I found the extras to be seriously lacking and not worth the additional price.",1175558400,7,970,4.5491329479768785
868612,5,6304415346,"I'm not sure if I'd have ever started watching Star Trek TNG if it wasn't for Patrick Stewart and his amazing performance in this movie.  How they ever got such an amazing actor to jump on board is beyond me but I'm very happy that he did.

When I watch or read a favorite movie or book, I tend to always skip sections to get to the part that was constantly replaying itself in my head over and over again all day.  In First Contact, I repeatedly jump to Patrick Stewart's ""Moby Dick"" scene where he passionately expresses his obsession with destroying the Borg.  It doesn't happen too often when an actor performs exactly how you'd like to express yourself in a way that you never realized might be in you.  I first saw this movie when I was young so it made a distinct impression on me when I saw it.  Been a Trekkie ever since.

I also thought James Cromwell played Zefram Cochran incredibly.  When he comments on the disparity between him and his future self to Commander Riker, it's just funny how life can turn out and that there is still hope for us all.  Without those two actors, the movie still would have been awesome but it would have just been another good movie but nothing you really had to watch over again.

So in my opinion, rent it if you must but it's definitely worth the $10.99.  By far the best movie from the TNG series and although I more often than not skip most of the movie to get to my favorite parts, I enjoy them enough to watch the movie in it's entirety once in a while.",1175558400,,1503,4.257042253521127
868613,5,6304415346,"One editorial review is right:  the even numbers are better.

There is a Next Generation episode which shares the name ""First Contact"", but the only common thread is the contact with a planet and those outside.  Actually, the emphasis is not as much on the first contact but the battle to allow it to be so.

SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS!  I found elements of different movies in this story, especially hints to Star Treks III (destroying the Enterprise) and IV (going back in time and telling select earth people something about the future).  Sometimes, it takes away from the originality of the story, but this is an exception.

Unlike Generations, this movie developed the teamwork that made this series and all other Star Treks.  However, the movie gets right into the action.

I find the Borg the most disturbing of the Star Trek villains, and this fit the bill.  Alice Krige was excellent in her role.

There are themes that were great in this movie.  For example, the friendship between Captain Picard and Data and sacrifice.  The issue of revenge and obsession.  The issue of submission to authority and the boldness to take risks when necessary.  The fact that people we look up to as heroes are just ordinary people like you and I who are motivated by the same things we are (or maybe not as high a motivation).  As a Christian, I can see spiritual warfare implications in the movie, as well as illustrations of pitfalls we believers can fall into.",1174953600,2,1509,4.702290076335878

Jean-Luc Picard and crew with a brand-new Enterprise-NCC 1701E (1701D was crashed in ST - Generations) and the new Enterprise is sleeker and more military looking with a smaller bridge as well and different design.  This story begins 6 years after the big battle with the Borg when Picard as ""Locutus"" had been forced to help the Borg.  Picard and crew are on a shakedown mission in the Neutral Zone when the Borg come back and are attacking earth.  The Enterprise races to help and are just in time to transport off the surviving crew of the Defiant (From Deep Space 9) including former crew member Commander Worf.  As Picard gives coordinates on the Borg ship for all the rest of the fleet to fire at to destroy the Borg cube, the Enterprise crew also notes a small sphere escaping the cube and heading toward Earth and producing some type of time warp.  Even as the Enterprise chase the sphere towards the time warp, they see the Earth change and suddenly it is 9 billion Borg and not humans inhabiting the planet!!  Of course, Picard & co. follow the Borg sphere into the past and destroy it but not before it has fired multiple times on a missile site in Montana.

What follows is classic ST:NG with humor, action and even a touch of romance.  Some of the best scenes include Lily (Alfre Woodard) from 21st century Earth on the Enterprise and viewing Earth from space, Counselor Deanna Troi falling face down drunk on a table while trying to keep up with Zephram Cochrane and Commander Worf's expression when told he is accompanying Picard on a space walk!!

  Frakes's directors  commentary track is entertaining.  He is a cappable director and you can hear his joy in being in charge of this project.  He knows his subject and his actors and it shows.  If you get an audio from someone like Ridley Scott you find he may know his camera angles and lighing setups but he knows jack about his films text ro subtext.

  The extra featurette about Jerry Goldsmith's work on the music for the film was a rich slice of movie history we don't get every day.  He was a unique talent and seeing him work and finding out how his music has been such a huge part of the Trek experiance since it's rebirth was fantastic.  I enjoyed the films score before I viewed this extra and after seeing this it was even more meaningfull.

It's re-watch factor is very high, particularly if you really enjoy the Next Generation. While I would have appreciated a bit more space battles between the ships themselves, what space battling offered is extremely well done.

But the main focus of the film's storyline is the stark contrast of the nightmare happening on the enterprise, it's getting assimilated! with the outlandish earthly antics of reluctant visionary/lunatic Zefram Cochrane (oobie doobie) and the team of Geordi, Riker, and Troi trying to persuade him to make his historic flight, completely oblivious to what is going on up in space.

The borg themselves have never been creepier, and they really come off as unstoppable. The interaction between the borg queen and Data makes a great story, as is the pairing of Picard and Lily. I think the Picard/Lily arguing at the movie's end is a bit contrived but hey, it's just a movie.

And its hard to go wrong with a stellar cast, especially a cast that influences the script ( Stewart made considerable story ""suggestions"" that shifted the balance of the story flow).

As a film, yes it is good, but as a Star Trek film, I would rate this  even less than Star Trek 5, and its problems were  enormous. By all accounts the production of FIRST CONTACT was a breeze in comparison.

And the great thing is that you decide how you feel on all these issues, because the two disc set is extremely comprehensive in basically  all  areas of the film.

To top it off, you also have the one thing that ever made any Star Trek movie or episode good: a rejection of the notion that humans in the future have evolved so that they are inherently ""better"" than people who live today.

Because Captain Picard is a flawed man who is pursuing vengeance for something that was done to him, he is an approachable character who makes morally questionable decisions, and that keeps this movie interesting.

868732,5,6304415346,"In science fiction, most anything can happen and in time travel most anything routinely happens.  In Star Trek, it's nearly guaranteed something fun, engaging and uplifting will happen.  With Star Trek: First Contact, these high expectations are met to the fullest.

Although released in late November 1996, the movie plays like a big summer popcorn flick.  From the dark opener, a chilling nightmare flashback suffered by Captain Picard recalling his time under the influence of alien invaders, to space battles, to combat which explode aboard the starship, the movie delivers incredible action on all fronts.  The Borg is the enemy the valiant Enterprise crew must defeat.  Borg can be best described as 'cybernetic zombies' - an effective cross between Resident Evil like shambling creatures and wired in Matrix like cyborgs.

This was the second feature film based on The Next Generation TV show.  Despite the polished romp of the previous film Generations, the Next Gen crew's first, in many ways First Contact comes off as their debut.  Generations relied on Captain Kirk as an important linchpin of its plot and the TNG crew were almost glorified guest stars in their own film.  Here they are more confident and committed.  Maybe it's even the fact that the TV Starship was destroyed in the last film.  As great as it was to see our heroes walking around the old sets of the show, at times it felt like a pricey two part episode.  With a new ship, new uniforms and a newly designed Borg - complete with a weirdly seductive leader, The Borg Queen, First Contact allowed the new generation to stand on its own.  Co-stars James Cromwell and Alfre Woodward sparkle as scientists intent on launching the first warp drive capable ship from the ashes of a planet whose populace exist in a sad twilight world of grimy shanty towns with only faint traces of planet Earth's former glory.

The optical FX provided by ILM remain some of the most convincing Star Trek footage ever realized.  This was the first Star Trek movie to broadly use digital ships.  Models are still used in the film, however it's nearly impossible to distinguish them from the digital.  A main set piece - perhaps the film's most electrifying moment  - not counting the Borg Queen's fantastic entrance - consists of dozens of Starships battering a Borg Cube with everything they have and then some.  It's in this moment that we see more Starship designs at one time than in practically any other Star Trek moment, although the finale of Deep Space Nine which aired three years later, may indeed rival this incredible battle.  Granted, it's a rather short engagement, but the spectacular visuals leave a great impression of just how powerful Starfleet can be and maybe more importantly that a Borg Cube stands nearly impregnable.

Alice Krige arguably steals the movie.  She ""brings order to chaos"" as she explains to a puzzled captive Data who wonders how the massive amount of Borg thoughts could ever be controlled by one entity.  Krige's Oscar nominated make-up and her truly other worldly performance are real highlights of this outing.  I've watched her entrance a dozen times and it still leaves me in awe.  Krige does more with her voice and eyes than most actors do with their entire bodies.  Her portrayal ranks up there with many of the most compelling Star Trek villains or villains period in film history.

The DVD brims with fun and informative extras.  This is one you'll pop in many times.  First Contact lives up to its name in more ways than one.  It's the first Star Trek movie to show how humanity became a space faring civilization which would lead to the birth of the Federation, the first to showcase a new Starship design along with new uniforms in quite sometime.  It's also the first Star Trek movie to be released on DVD and the first one I ever watched or purchased.  The Borg Queen really was wrong, this isn't the end of the future - but the beginning.",1154736000,5,3951,4.788774002954209
868733,2,6304415346,"I finally managed to see Star Trek: First Contact.  One of the first impressions I had was that Jonathan Frakes did not know how to describe the plot of a movie he is directing.  Most of what I heard him say in an interview just before the opening turned out to be false of nonexistent.

This film does not suffer the fate of the odd numbered movies but was not as good as the even numbered movies.  Personally I would give it about two and a half stars.

The movie concerns the Borg but ignores much of their history.  If the movie is to be believed, Picard has not encountered the Borg for six years (when he became Locutus of Borg).  No mention was made of the Borg's earlier assault on the Federation (under the direction of Lor).  Instead it was as if that season finale cliffhanger never happened.  So the movie did not fit well with the series.  But how did it hold up on its own?

I felt it was a bit too campy.  The future was changed as hundreds of people in one of the most important places on Earth were killed by the Borg.  So first contact might still have been made but history was still changed.  Most of the good scenes and best acting were included in the trailer.  After the high-energy opening battle (almost completely shown in the trailer and commercials) things settle down to a dull pace.

The Borg are assimilating the Enterprise and its crew but still ignore the bridge crew when they walk amongst them.  With the Enterprise under partial Borg control the away team is unconcerned that they have lost contact which effectively strands them in history.  Some extra scenes were added to try and give us a glimpse of the main crew (as they no longer appear weekly) even though they were not necessary to the overall plot.  The historic flight that leads to first contact had William Riker and Jordy LaForge as bridge crew thus changing history even more.  Technically first contact was third contact as Lily had met a Klingon and the Borg.  DS9 history still has not made an allowance for Worf or the Defiant to be near Earth.  The Defiant, the most sophisticated war ship in the fleet, used none of its technical advantages.  Of course how the Defiant exists in defiance of the treaty with the Romulans has never been really explained either.

Okay, so the movie makes less sense that many of the episodes and it may not be worth paying full price to see or to own, but it was fun, if for no other reason than to see some of our favorite characters back in action.",1153612800,2,2488,4.417582417582418
868734,4,6304415346,"Those terrifying adversaries the Borg return to menace the crew of the Enterprise and the world in this exciting Star Trek film.  The Borg, led by a creepy queen (the same actress who played the White Witch in the 2005 Chronicles of Narnia), seek to assimilate the entire population of Earth by traveling back in time to stop the first launch of the warp drive.  Will, Deanna, and Geordi travel to Earth to assist the scientist in his launch.  But the scientist is a drunk, and very turned off by the adoration and idolization proferred by the folks from the future.  He runs away.  Meanwhile, the Borg Queen is hard at work trying to figure out how to assimilate Data (Brent Spiner).

Great action from the moment the movie begins to the very end.  The only thing I didn't like were the new hairstyles of Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  Blehh!  They look very bland as Deanna has straight brunette hair and Crusher has a shorter blond style.",1152835200,,977,4.633720930232558

Holy Toledo!  This movie is awesome!  Great effects + Great story = The best Next Gen movie of them all.  We finally get to see the birth of the Star Trek we all know and love in this film's finale.  The Borg are back and badder than ever... and have a very hot Queen to lead them (Alice Krige).  Patrick Stewart really gets to show some anger, which didn't happen too much in the series.  James Cromwell guests and creates a much more memorable Cochrane than the guy in the original series.  Alfre Woodard also guests as Lily, a 21st century woman who gets taken up to the Enterprise.

868736,5,6304415346,"This film, ""Star Trek:  First Contact"", being the first official `Next Generation' only `Star Trek' movie, the creative teams behind this picture had their hands full with trying to come up with an original storyline that would be exciting to audiences, both `Trekkies' and non, while still maintaining the quality and tone of the TV series that this crew hails from.  To solve this problem, the writers came up with a brilliant story that would serve as a closer to a few episodes that occurred during the series that were held as fan-favorites, of course the episodes I'm referring to deal with the deadliest villains this crew ever faced, the Borg.  The Borg are cybernetic beings that are linked into one another in a sort of hive, in their society there is no individuality, everyone is the same, and their collective goal is to assimilate every being in the universe, adding their characteristics and culture into theirs, therefore making them the ultimate beings.  In the series, the first appearance of the Borg was a 2-part episode arc titled ""The Best of Both Worlds"", in the story the Borg capture Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), assimilating him and all his knowledge into their collective.  This leaves the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-D in a massive dilemma, do they stage a rescue for their beloved captain, or do what is right for Starfleet and destroy the Borg cube and their captain along with it.  In the episodes, the crew led by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) led a rescue to get Captain Picard back, and after successfully removing the Borg influence from him, gained some very helpful insight into the inner-workings of this new villainous species.  So for the story in this movie the writers chose to force Captain Picard and his crew to face that terrible time yet again, and this time the Borg are much more powerful, and have some new tricks up their sleeves.

""Star Trek:  First Contact"" as I stated above finds the crew of the newly commissioned Enterprise-E coming face-to-face with the Borg yet again.  However, the difference this time is that the Borg has learned a new trick, time travel.  During a conflict between the Enterprise and a Borg cube, the cube launches a Borg sphere in an attempt to escape before the destruction of the cube ship.  However, this sphere contains the capability for time travel, so with the Enterprise in hot pursuit the cube travels back in time with the Enterprise close behind and transporting both ships into the past.  The specific moment in time that the sphere picked to return to seemed random at first, but instead held a much more sinister reason, the sphere returned to the past to stop a scientist from conducting the first warp drive test.  If the Borg succeeds in stopping this warp drive test, two things happen, the future that the crew of the Enterprise knows ceases to exist because without warp drive there is no Starfleet, and the second thing is that if the test doesn't occur, first contact with the alien race known as Vulcans will not happen.  So, not only does the Enterprise-E and her crew have to save the people of the past from the assimilation of the Borg, but also save their own futures before its too late.

In their second adventure on the big screen the crew of the Enterprise-E were forced to tackle their deadliest villains, the Borg.  Many fans that were disillusioned by the previous `Star Trek' movie effort, ""Star Trek:  Generations"", were very pleased to learn that the Borg were being chosen as the villains for this film.  With the expectations for this movie very high, the stage was set for `Star Trek' to once again be number one at the box office.  The problem with hype is that most of the time the hype overshadows the movie, and though the movie may still be successful, it would still be considered somewhat of a failure if the film even remotely disappointed any fans.  This problem was easily bypassed by this movie, the creative forces behind ""Star Trek:  First Contact"" crafted a terrific story of intense drama, fast-paced and energetic action, and some bits of humor, and needless to say audiences were not disappointed in the least.  In fact, many `Trekkies' hold ""Star Trek:  First Contact"" in high regard, and view it as possibly one of the best `Star Trek' films ever, and definitely one of the best for the `Next Generation' crew.  The actors were all very solid in their performance, which was expected since these are characters they portrayed for 7 seasons on the TV show, and in the previous movie, so by now their characters are instinctual to them.  The special effects were top-notch, some of the best effects work in this series can be found in this movie.  In truth, there isn't one single negative comment I can make regarding this movie; this film is definitely top-notch for this franchise!

868737,5,6304415346,"I have often said, not only is this movie good as a Star Trek film, it's just a good movie, period.  Undoubtedly the best Star Trek film to date.

Patrick Stewart, as usual, does an excellent job.  I love his acting style, his passion for his role is unmatched.

The interraction between the crew.. it is not a stretch of the imagination to believe that these people know and care for one another.  The subtle nuances of expression, most especially with Riker, Data, Picard, and Worf, add believabilty and humanity to their acting.

Lilly, excellent character development and a wonderful performance.

And of course the plot and action.  No holes, not a dull moment nor any excess/uneeded details.

In times likes these, I find myself gravitating towards the Star Trek universe.  This movie certainly delivers the feeling that, if one man could have such a marvelous and hopeful vision for the future and could see the potential inherent in humankind, perhaps it is not impossible that those in power today could also see it and strive for it.",1146700800,,1043,4.808988764044944

This is the kind of soundtrack where you can just crank up the soundtrack CD (which I own) and enjoy it as a piece of music without even seeing the movie.

First Contact is the Next Gen crew at their very best, and this intelligently scripted movie excels at all levels. There are also so many excellent performances in here, including a stunning Alice Krige as The Borg Queen, that this movie will keep the average fan on the edge of her/his seat.

Yet it is not all intensity, and Marina Sirtis turns in a hilarious and quite frankly, very sexy performance as a tipsy Deanna Troi. It is the increased warmth between the crew members that stirs echoes of the Classic Trek crew, and had the Next Gen movies been able to duplicate the high standard set by First Contact, they would have won over a lot more fans. Sadly, Insurrection and Nemesis never delivered on the promise of this genuine classic.

Will they make another movie to repair the lost credibility over Nemesis? I don't know. After all, I'm just a reviewer Jim, not a miracle worker.

The ILM effects are terrific, the performances by James Cromwell, Alice Krige (sp?) and Alfie Woodard are top notch .

The best things about this film is Picard trying to control his lust for revenge, and Data being tempted by the human flesh he is given by the Borg queen!

The plot is unique, and the action is varied.

Alas, there are some problems...

The early starship battle scene is too short, and the destruction of the Borg cube is too easy!!

Some of the humor falls on it's face... like when Picard and Data are touching the starship ""Pheonix,"" Troi asks them if the ""three of  them"" would ""like to be alone.""  later on, Troi plays intoxicated well, but it just ends up being silly. And Picard's line ""rumors of my assimilation have been greatly exagerated..."" made me groan out loud.

And finally, the Borg Queen is too human like! Her behavior is emotional and tempermental. The scariest thing about the Borg as a race is their dispassionate, cold and mechanical motivations... and here their leader acts like some reject from ""Desperate Housewives.""

And the ""time travel"" plot has a hole. If the Borg can time travel at the push of a button, why don't they try to assimilate Earth in the past... over, and over, and over again? With that type of power, the entire Universe should be ""assimilated.""

Despite these problems, this film is the most consistent of the Next Gen films and is thoroughly enjoyable!

868831,5,6304415346,"There is a rule that many are familiar with: every even-numbered Star Trek rules. Many consider the 2nd film the Wrath of Khan to be the best, just like the 2nd Star Wars Empire Strikes Back the best(I'm going by release order here). First Contact then would be the Revenge of the Sith(or A New Hope, depending on your tastes) for Star Trek.

In Generations, you had the old cast passing the torch to the new one. Here we have Generations' cast first film by themselves and it's quite good. Previously in the series, Captain Picard got assimilated by the Borg, a race that turns others into them and are part of a collective. During a battle with a Borg cube, a getaway vehicle creates a time portal and assimilates Earth in the past, thus present-day Earth is all Borg.

So the Enterprise has to go back in time and stop the Borg. Only the Borg picked a peculiar date: the day before mankind makes first contact with an alien race which then kickstarts the science to make galaxy travel possible. The ship that starts first contact is damaged so the crew on Earth have to fix it by the next day. Not only that, the crew on the Enterprise have to deal with invading Borg, who are trying to signal other Borg for help.

What films like Alien and Star Wars brought to sci-fi was the idea of a used future. This meant things were broken down or barely working(I still get a laugh after Han Solo has to punch the Falcon to get it working in Empire). Star Trek on the other hand like 2001 looked to sterile, too neat. Generations suffered from this and even here when the ship gets overrun, it still looks too neat. Character-wise, it's showing signs of change like when Picard found out he was the last Picard in Generations or here when he deals with his Borg experience.

I'm not a Trekkie, in fact I haven't seen a single episode of the old show, even the one where Spock and Kirk fought or one from Generations. However, I still liked watching this film. Although it doesn't have as cool scenes as the Ribbon and stellar cartography in Generations it's still a good film nonetheless, and most likely your 2nd favorite Trek film.",1131667200,,2128,4.448717948717949

The Borg, our nemeses from The Next Generation have returned, and now they are time travelling to disrupt the Earth's past (This raises some questions of logic, but since it serves the movie, I can not complain). Will, Deanna, and Geordie go to Earth to help repair the first Warp ship, while Picard and the rest discover the Borg have survived, and are forming a collective in engineering. There are some good action sequences, including a suspenceful spacewalk scene on the Enterprise-E.

This episode in the series shows a bit of progression from the last movie. The ships in this movie seem to fit with the style of Deep Space Nine. Geordie no longer has a VISOR, but instead has ocular implants. The Enterprise-E introduces the Soveregin class vessel, a bit less comfortable than the luxurious Galaxy-class, but having a better exterior design.

Fans of DS9 will notice the brief appearance of the Defiant, which is damaged in battle, but designated by Picard ""Adrift, but salvageable"". Fans of Voyager will also notice a cameo of the Enterprise's Emergency Medical Hologram, who Dr. Crusher uses to distract the Borg.

868985,3,6304415346,"Co-writer Brannon Braga tells a story during the commentary and in one of the documentaries here about attending a showing of this film and witnessing some guy telling his girlfriend ""See, I TOLD you it would be good"" after the film.  Brannon then goes on to say that the guy probably had to ""drag her sorry butt"" to see the film.  I had a similar, though decidedly opposite experience: when this film came out, I had to beg my wife to go see it with me.  I was SURE the film would be great, the ads looked fantastic!  At the end, we were BOTH disappointed.  Only through repeated viewings have I found it to be somewhat enjoyable.

So what don't I like about this film?  Mostly, I dislike it's total disregard for any sort of continuity with established Trek lore.  Along with that, I have some other unrelated gripes.  Here's a partial list:

1. Picard now somehow has a telepathic bond with the Borg which didn't exist previously to this film.

2. Picard also has an obsession with destroying the Borg, which, again, he did not have previously in the series.  In fact, in the episode ""I, Borg"" (oh help me I'm entering geekdom here), he had the opportunity to destroy them all, and REFUSED.

3. If the Borg can go back in time at will, why not just GO BACK IN TIME BEFORE REACHING EARTH?  This way, they avoid the battle.

4. Speaking of the battle at the beginning of the film, Picard and crew are sent to the Romulan Neutral Zone because Starfleet doesn't trust Picard to deal with the Borg since he was once assimilated.  How does THIS make sense, considering he successfully dealt with them AFTER his assimilation in the series?

5. The Enterprise makes it from the Neutral Zone to Earth in enough time to join the battle.  Now, I'm not enough of a Trek fan to know how far from Earth the Neutral Zone is, but I do know that it is very far -- communications alone take a long time to reach Earth from there.  Yet somehow, the Enterprise makes it back to Earth in...oh, about a minute.

6. Data's ""To hell with our orders"" line.  I liked it better when it was SPOCK'S LINE (paraphrased) in Star Trek 6.  And speaking of a lack of originality...

7. ...the way the Borg ""assimilate"" the Enterprise and take it over, making the environment their own.  I liked it better the first time I saw it, when it was called ALIENS and written by James Cameron.  Continuing on this theme...

8. ...The Borg ""Queen"", and the referring to other Borg as ""Drones"".  Forgetting for a minute that this totally destroys the whole unified species premise established in the show, I ALSO liked this better when it was ALIENS by James Cameron (see above).

9. The original series states that Zephram Cochrane is from Alpha Centauri, not Earth (though the Star Trek Encyclopedia states that he was probably from Earth and then MOVED to Alpha Centauri.  O-kay...).  Brannon Braga has said in the past that you don't center a film around a character who appeared just once in an episode of the TV series.  That's funny Brannon, since the most popular Trek film is still WRATH OF KHAN, centered around...a character who appeared only once in an episode of the original series.  And how many times, when a new Trek film is released, has someone from Paramount said ""The new movie has a great villian, he's a lot like Khan!""?

10. Not only does the crew reveal who they are to Cochrane, and what he is destined to do, they tell him DAMN NEAR EVERYTHING ELSE they can about the future.  So much for not corrupting the timeline.

11. The continued reduction of Worf to comic relief.  Ha!  He's afraid of zero-g!  It's funny!  Oh, my sides!

12. It sets the stage for the series ENTERPRISE, and the continued destruction of the Trek franchise.

I could go on and on, but the main problem here is the total lack of any continuity.  In fact, the film can't even keep continuity with ITSELF!  Example: Picard tells Lily that the ship has 24 decks, but elsewhere in the film, one of the crew states that the Borg control deck 26!  Braga and Moore even address the continuity issue in their commentary track.  Braga admits that ""sometimes"" breaking continuity ""a little bit"" is neccessary (though he seems to have done it quite often), while Ron Moore recommends eventually just starting over -- taking existing characters and just re-writing the series and its continuity (much like what he did with Battlestar Galactica -- I guess in Moore's re-vamped Star Trek, Spock would be a woman, and any characters who were originally played by black actors would be portrayed by white men or asian women).

Though the film is popular amongst fans, there are those of us who feel that the total disregard for continuity ruins it.  At the time of its release, Sci-Fi Universe ran a two-page spread detailing all of the things they found wrong with the film (going on much longer than I did above).  But if you look past the discrepancies in continuity, the lack of originality and blatant derivation, and some truly dumb humor (not to mention the lack of any real theme -- as Gene Roddenberry or Michael Piller would say, ""What's it ABOUT?""), it's not a bad film.",1121126400,9,5124,4.554704595185996

The fights between the crew of the Enterprise and the Borgs during this movie was so thrilling, exciting, and scary.  Besides battling the awful Borg, having to protect the past so that the Vulcans can make first contact with the human race is not an easy feat.

In other words, this movie has it all: action, adventure, some comedy (when Data puts the doctor Beverly overboard, that was priceless how funny it was), and drama.

It features all the classic ""Trek"" elements, while injecting horror, humor, and a bit of ""Trek"" history into the mix. Clever writing, superb acting, and spectacular visual effects and action make this one a ""Star Trek"" film not to be missed.

And now, the film has received the ultimate treatment with the ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD! The featurettes are great, and the two commentary tracks (The first by Actor/Director Jonathan Frakes, and the second by screenwriters Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga) are both informative and very funny. Fans of the film, or of ""Star Trek"" for that matter, will not want to miss assimilating this one into their DVD Collections.

Movie/DVD Grade: A+",1118188800,,793,5.0
869065,3,6304415346,"Star Trek: Fist Contact is actually Star Trek VIII, and the first feature film containing solely the Next Generation cast.  With Jonathan Frakes (Riker) at the helm as director, veteran TNG screenplay writers Braga and Moore, production designer Zimmerman, and composer Jerry Goldsmith, this film truly contains the best family of TNG artists ever assembled.  The quality of the film reflects this collaboration.  It is far and away superior to either Nemesis or Insurrection, and objectively much better than Generations (although I have a soft spot in my heart for that film).

The story - another Borg cube has decided to challenge the Federation, and the fleet assembles for battle.  This time, the fleet fares better than at the Battle of Wolf 359 (as shown in the TNG episodes ""Best of Both Worlds"" I and II).  The Cube is destroyed, but a small escape ship emerges and vanishes through a temporal (time-travel) rift.  The Enterprise is quick to pursue, knowing that the Borg must intend travelling back in time to change history and/or assimilate Earth in the past.  Our heroes arrive in the year 2063 (just after WWIII in Trek lore) to find the small Borg ship bombarding Earth.  Their target - Earth's first warp-capable ship which allows humans to make First Contact with an alien species and ultimately pave the way for the creation of the Federation and of Starfleet.  The TNG crew must fight off the Borg (who take over the Engineering decks on the Enterprise), set the timeline right (without themselves disrupting it), and save the First Contact event.

This must be the most action-oriented film of all the Treks.  There is a big space battle, hand-to-hand combat with the Borg, etc.  However, the soul of the film is still in the interactions between the characters: Worf and Picard disagree about how to best fight the Borg, Picard must rescue Data, Troi and Riker must work together to ensure First Contact, etc.  Even fan-favourite Reg Barkley makes an appearance!  Seamlessly inserted into the cast are Alfrie Woodard as a 21st-century engineer and James Cromwell as Zefram Cochrane, legendary pilot and inventor of Earth's first warp-capable ship.  A word about the soundtrack is appropriate here as well - veteran Jerry Goldsmith delivers a supurb score, weaving in elements of his other Trek scores.  Worf's action scenes are punctuated by the Klingon theme from ST:TMP, the space-walk music is reminiscent of the V'ger theme, etc.

So why only the 3-star rating?  Unfortunately, there are a lot of little issues that detract from the enjoyment of the film upon repeated viewings, which is why you buy the DVD, after all.  For example, the first 45 minutes are fantastic - action, suspense, pacing, etc. are perfect.  After that, though, the editors and/or director allow the picture to slow down and it seems to run out of steam.  More alarming are more fundamental story problems.  For example:  the away team loses contact with the Enterprise (when the Borg take over part of it) but never seems concerned.  In addition, we get an extended Moby Dick reference, which is basically a rehash of Star Trek II - there's lots of literature out there to quote, it's sheer laziness to repeat the Moby Dick theme.

But the most serious problem is the change wrought upon the Borg, relative to their civilisation in the TV show.  They are given a queen who, apparently, controls the collective consciousness.  Suddenly there is a leader who, when killed, fatally disrupts the collective so it can no longer function.  The original point of the Borg was that they were not hierarchical - the only way to kill the Borg was to wipe out every single one of them.  Now, suddenly, there is a simple magic bullet solution that all you have to do is find and kill the leader?  This completely negates the strength and fearsomeness of the Borg, making them another mundane enemy race.

Naturally, I have no complaints about this special edition.  There are lots of goodies here, including three commentaries by (in order of decreasing interest) writers Braga and Moore, Trek guru Okuda, and director Frakes.  There are lots of little featurettes to keep the techies happy, talking about effects, design, etc.  And the price is very reasonable for a DVD of this quality!",1118102400,7,4277,4.9094707520891365

Because it's a widescreen picture the closed captioning doesn't interfere with the picture. It's jam packed with all sorts of extra bonus special features. Everything you ever wanted to know about First Contact and weren't afraid to be told. Let's not forget what a wonderful job Jonathan Frakes did directing. He truly proved himself a more than qualified director for feature films. We all know what a great job he did behind the cameras on the T.V. show. My boyfriend and I watched it together and he was really impressed. He asked me how much it cost. When I told him how inexpensive it was he bought two copies. One for a gift to another Treky fan. I highly recommend this two disk set and suggest you buy it right away before they run out. If you're not satisfied with it, I'll pay you for it. That's how much confidence I have that you'll absolutely LOVE it. Believe me when I tell you this is one purchase that you will never regret. ORDER NOW!!! In response to your comment first of all thank you for reading my review and please feel free to check them all out. You are correct I didn't leave enough information on my personal feelings. I thought the film was terrific. It lived up to the quality that we are used to getting when we see anything that starts out with the heading Star Trek.

869069,4,6304415346,"Forget Star Trek - Insurrection and Nemesis.
ST - First Contact still rules among the Star Trek TNG movies, and is also a damn good sci fi flick even outside the Star Trek fold. I'm a die hard Star Trek lover but I've had it said again and again by people not so much into it - ""First Contact was a really good flick"" Even the fact that people, incl. myself often leave the franchise name out, and simply call the movie ""First Contact"" is a good indicator of its great stand-alone status. This is all very ironic - and quite an achievement since the story or First Contact is a direct follow up of an event that took place in the ST TNG TVshow (""the Best of Both Worlds"") and none of the other ST movies are.

The villain of this movie is a cybernetic race called the Borg. Their major creepiness lies their habit of capturing other humanoids and turning them into one of their own. The victims face a horrifying transformation, as limbs and other body parts are being chopped off and replaced by cybernetic devices, turning them into half robots. What's even more terrifying is that they're being jacked into the Hive Mind. Every trace of individual personality erased. So, it's one of those creepy ""Alien"" concepts - one less of us means one more of them, which I can't get enough of.

Ok... enough praise.
The DVD qualities are well above average, just because of sheer abundance, but not very entertaining. Sure, there are some interesting documentaries on building sets and scale models etc. But mostly it's the actor/producer/writer people all sitting there doing the same tired old ""oh he is such a talented and creative person, and I'm so proud to have been working with him""-thing as usual. I would like a little more insight to the special FX work and some bonus hardware like a collectible figurine or a specially customized case or something would have been nice. It IS ""Special Collector's Edition"" after all. There are plain DVDs and even VHS's that deserves that title better than this one.
SO, you really have to ask yourself. How much of a Star Trek fan are you? How interested are you in ""the Making of""-documentaries, and most importantly, how badly do you need know how much Rick Berman admires Jonathan Frakes's talents as a director? If none of the above interests you, I suggest you buy the regular cheaper copy, with no extra features and ONE GREAT MOVIE on it.

869070,5,6304415346,What could be better to Star Trek fans than a combination of the Borg and time travel?  Nothing.  This is by far my favorite Star Trek movie and I was so excited to finally add it to my DVD collection.  Definately recommend it for any Star Trek fan.,1114905600,,249,4.145833333333333
869071,5,6304415346,"Many fans consider FIRST CONTACT to be the best film of Paramount's ten entry STAR TREK series yet.  While that is debatable overall, it is the best of the four films that center around the 24th century adventures of Captain Jean-Luc Picard and his crew.  Responsible for directing several classic episodes of the television series upon which this film is based, actor/director Jonathan Frakes (who also stars as Commander Riker) makes his feature directorial debut here, and rises to the occasion on every level.

All the regulars from the later seasons of the show return, as well as one of the most popular and threatening villains ever created for the franchise...the Borg.  Picard and Data are given the center focus here, but one cannot really blame the screenwriters for catering to the talents of both Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner.  This time around, Stewart brings new depth to Picard as he battles inner demons and his increasing appetite for vengeance against the Borg.  Brent Spiner further explores the android Data's human side as he is given an opportunity to experience the realities of flesh more intimately than ever before.  The rest of the crew all have well rounded and entertaining scenes throughout too, a credit to the screenwriter's effort not to ignore the supporting cast members.  Look for humorous cameo appearances from VOYAGER crewmembers Robert Picardo and Ethan Phillips, as well as the re-appearance of Dwight Schultz as Lt. Barclay.

Guest starring this time around is James Cromwell, Alfre Woodard, and Alice Krige.  James Cromwell plays Zephram Cochrane, the inventor of warp drive who lives in the 21st century.  His performance as a man who isn't exactly what history has made him out to be is solid and entertaining overall, but tends to go just a bit over the top at times.  Alfre Woodard plays Cochrane's assistant Lilly, who gets whisked away into the battle to save the Enterprise from the ever increasing infestation of Borg.  Woodard gives an outstanding performance that exudes boldness, determination, and courage.  She is the one person that isn't afraid to confront Picard's obsession with revenge, and it pays off in one of the most powerful dramatic scenes of the film.  Alice Krige plays the creepily seductive Borg Queen.  This character was created to put a face on a somewhat faceless villain.  Krige is masterful in the role, effectively manipulating the situation with Data at every turn, using his desire to become more human against him.  She is the ultimate temptress for our favorite android, if you will.  All in all, a great trio of guest stars!!

Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore  returned once again to pen the story, having worked on both the television series and the previous feature film STAR TREK: GENERATIONS.  One problem I have with this duo is their tendency to ignore what has previously been established in Star Trek.  In this film, major changes were made to the Borg that didn't mesh well with the series at the time.  The Borg Queen is a prime example of this, for her very existence contradicted what the Borg are in every way.  Fans had to really use their imagination to fix the discrepancies created by this representation of Zephram Cochrane versus the one presented to us in the original 1960's series, one that Mr. Braga admits in an interview they purposely disregarded in favor of creating an all new and original characterization.  Regardless of their tendency to stray from what has been established, the two still managed to craft a very exciting and somewhat solid story full of action and wonderful dramatic moments.

This film features some truly beautiful special effects work by Industrial Light & Magic.  They created the all new Enterprise E which debuted in the film, and it is a stunning redesign of the classic starship.  Worth noting is the fact that this is the last time viewers will see the Enterprise and other ships represented by models before everything switched over to the use of CGI animation.  Other scenes worthy of noting are the launch of the Phoenix and the introduction of the Borg Queen, which was done with minimal use of CGI.  Sadly, this was ILM's final foray into the Trek universe and, quite frankly, Star Trek will never ""look"" this good again!

The DVD's picture quality is top-notch, and it is supported by a great sounding DTS audio track.  The animated menus are really nifty and fun to watch, as I have come to expect from this series of films.  The special edition features are pretty good this time around, though I was dismayed to see the return of  another ""filler"" documentary (First Contact: The Possibilities) that had nothing to do with the film.  These waste of time documentaries plagued the special edition release of earlier Star Trek DVDs, but were thankfully absent from the last two.  I truly hated to see the return of this kind of junk that offers nothing relevant to the creation of the film.

I was very glad to see the tribute to composer Jerry Goldsmith, a man who will be sorely missed in the world of film scores.  He was responsible for the main theme of THE NEXT GENERATION, which of course was derived from his original Oscar nominated score for 1979's STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE.  That theme has become just as identified with Star Trek as Alexander Courage's original tune from the very first series.  Goldsmith scored five of the Star trek features, as well as classics like ALIEN, THE OMEN trilogy, and POLTERGEIST, just to name a few.  The only thing I found a tad disappointing in the tribute was the fact that it focused nearly entirely on his contribution to the Star Trek universe, barely mentioning anything from the rest of his television and movie score career that spanned half a century.

Overall, this is a very satisfying DVD release of an entertaining entry in the Star Trek movie franchise.",1112745600,,5873,4.860301507537688

It Comes in a black Plastic case with the cover, Opens like pages with one disc per compartment. (2disc 2 compartments)
There was no insert or coupon ( I like inserts that have info and pics! it's like an egg you don't have to look for). no worry none in the compartment.

There was no Paper information other than a card advertising other trek dvds to buy and even it was one sided.
-Disc one is the film.
-Disc two has the extras,  If you do not happen to be a big fan of the films directer ( Jonathon Frakes) then you may get tired of how great he is said to be. But hey they can not say bad things and get in the extras part of the dvd LOL.
-So far I have found Three Easter eggs or not so obvious extras. I won't tell you what they are but where they are at the end. Otay.
This dvd is in wide screen and the picture was great on my 20""Flat screen toshiba tv. Also Nice on a Jvc 27"" just to let you know.
For a few shots in the film I Used my dvd zoom and they still looked great.
There are subtitles and CC.
If your dvdplayer does transmitt CC dvd you can view cc or subtitles. NOTE: Not all dvds have subtitles but some come only CC and not all players transmit the CC signal...So if that is a issue well now u know.
At this price and the fact that it was fast delivery to my post box then home and ripped off the shrink wrap and made popcorn and Zoomed up the volume...and hit play.... OoPS Sorry!
OK I had this movie on Vhs and and and I like the film ok. I would buy this dvd for my relatives ad friends but they don't dig it the way I do. so that is that.
A gripe was made about the ... Female character of color in the movie... If you watch the extras you find out why her character was there. I liked her. but thats just me.
This Film is an action trek film and tells you some trek history.  Some is quite kind of dark and a bit of fright in the borg theme, but these are the bad guys right! (I do not like horror so its not like that).
 Take note though of the rating of the film before you stuff the kiddies in front of it and then later get mad if they want to crawl in your bed. :)

You have to just love the borg Queen!!! or luv to dislike her as the case may be.

869191,5,6304415346,"The eighth big-screen installment of the ""Star Trek"" franchise was released to theaters in 1996 with the title ""Star Trek: First Contact"".  It was also the second ""Star Trek"" film to feature the cast from the highly successful television series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (1987-1994).  Unlike the previous film, it did not include any of the cast members from the original ""Star Trek"" series.  Instead, ""Star Trek: First Contact"" begins with the crew on board the newest starship to have the name ""Enterprise"", the NCC-1701-E.  When Starfleet detects a Borg cube headed for Earth, instead of ordering the ""USS Enterprise"" to join the forces to engage the cube, Starfleet orders it to the Romulan Neutral Zone for fear of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), who had once been forcibly assimilated into the Borg collective.  However, the Borg cube successfully gets through the Starfleet blockade, Captain Picard orders the Enterprise to intercept the Borg cube and to rally the surviving Starfleet ships for a last stand.  Upon arriving at the Borg cube, Captain Picard assumes command of the fleet and rescues the crew of the USS Defiant, which includes Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn).  Using his knowledge of the Borg, Captain Picard successfully destroys the Borg cube, but not before a smaller spherical ship escapes and heads for Earth.  Chasing it, the Borg sphere creates a wormhole into time and escapes to Earth's past; but since the USS Enterprise was also caught in the wormhole, it escapes the modified timeline of a Borg-dominated Earth and appears at the same point in history (300 years earlier) where the sphere arrived shortly before.  Finding the sphere attacking a missile outpost in Idaho, the USS Enterprise successfully destroys the sphere; but Captain Picard realizes that the Borg were attempting to destroy Earth's first warp ship created by the legendary Dr. Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell).  Beaming down to assess the damage at the outpost, Captain Picard is joined by Commander William Riker (William Frakes), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner), Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis).  There, they find the first warp ship intact, but are mistaken by a native of the time period, Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard), of being agents of an Eastern alliance that had initiated a world war several decades earlier.  Lily collapses and is beamed back to Enterprise with Dr. Crusher to help with her radiation poisoning.  In the meantime, the rest of the away team searches for Dr. Cochran; but Captain Picard realizes that not all of the Borg had been destroyed: some of them managed to beam aboard the Enterprise before the sphere was destroyed.  Can Captain Picard stop the Borg from taking over the Enterprise?  Can the away team find Dr. Cochran and repair the warp ship to initiate Earth's first-ever official contact with an alien species?  You'll just have to watch this exciting ""Star Trek"" film and see the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) reveal herself for the first time.

""Star Trek: First Contact"" was clearly one of the best films of the franchise ever produced, and was clearly the best of the four ""Star Trek"" films featuring the crew from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".  With impressive special effects, an engaging story, engaging characters and a wonderful script, ""Star Trek: First Contact"" is definitely one ""Star Trek"" film worth owning on DVD.  Other ""Star Trek"" characters that appear in this film include the Emergency Medical Hologram (Robert Picardo), Lieutenant Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) and Nurse Alyssa Ogawa (Patti Yasutake).  Other characters include Lieutenant Hawk (Neal McDonough), Admiral Hayes (Jack Shearer), Ruby (Hillary Hayes), Nicky the Nose (Don Stark), the Vulcan Captain (Cully Fredricksen) and the voice of the Enterprise computer (Majel Barrett).  Memorable scenes include the opening Borg attack scenes, the arrival in the past, finding the warp ship, finding Dr. Cochran, discovery of the Borg on the Enterprise, Data's capture, Lily with Picard, the holodeck scene, the space walk, the launch, Picard & the Borg Queen and the closing scenes.

The added DTS soundtrack is superb, surpassing even the great DD 5.1 mix in the original disc.  The Enterprise flyby of the Defiant is amazing!

Even though this is a double dip for most Star Trek fans, I recommend it and it is a must buy for anyone that does not yet own this excellent film!",1111104000,5,659,4.404958677685951
869193,5,6304415346,"This goes beyond the fact that the movie itself is a great one. You have a well balanced time travel story along with TNG's own best-bad guy, the Borg. This was the first real 'Next Generation' movie and comparing it to the other flims, all the characters were used wisely and had their moments. The movie's own slate of characters, Cochrane, Lily, the Borg Queen, are all pretty solid as well. This was a flim for fans of Trek as well as those who knew nothing about Star Trek.

Now, what makes this particular DVD so great? The extras. I haven't been that impressed with extra features in the past. I thought the candid moments on ""Generations CE"" was pretty good. This was beyond good, it was close to shocking how much details and how many great features went into this release.

Commentary by director-actor Jonathan Frakes: Frakes' commentary didn't really impress me too much. It was nice to hear his opinion and how he was best fit for the job. It said a lot about the films; having a director who knows the actors and knows Star Trek. If you thought ""Nemesis"" and it's director, Baird, were off, the commentary made by Frakes and others really lets you know what went wrong.

Commentary by screenwriters Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore: This was one of my favorite parts. I liked their comments on ""Generations"" but thought this really sold the film. They went on about how the story was developed, including the earlier First Contact script that didn't work. They also made comments about how this movie went on to influence ""Star Trek: Voyager"" and ""Enterprise"" and made connections between this story and the entire story on how ""Star Trek"" came around.

Text commentary by Michael Okuda and Denise Okuda

Jerry Goldsmith: A Tribute: This was definately fitting for this release. Goldsmith's ""First Contact"" score is great and those involved talk about how Goldsmith was able to use the music to create an entirely new level to the story. It also reaches beyond Trek and talks about his influence on other flims.

The Legacy of Zefram Cochrane: This was fun. The Cochrane of the Original Series and this film are different. The writers and producers talk about why that is and the actor who played Cochrane steps in and talks about his role here and how he returned to play Cochrane in the ""Enterprise"" episode ""Broken Bow.""

First Contact: The Possibilities: I found this to be a little boring and odd. It deals with SETI and groups interested in E.T. life in our own solar system. The actor that plays Cochrane talks about his own speculations and work within this area.

Unimatrix One: Contains clips from not only the film but ""Next Generation"" and ""Voyager."" The actors (Frakes, Burton, Sirtis, McFadden) all give their opinion of the Borg. This feature was great because it took the time to show the evolution of the Borg from their first appearance to their last in ""Endgame."" Lots of ""Voyager"" clips and even some commentary on how they've been watered down. It's nice because we get to hear speculations of who the Borg were before their latest incarnation. There is also a part devoted to the ""Borg babe"" as she's called by Braga, Seven of Nine.

The Queen: Alice Krige takes the time to talk about how she developed the character. She's interesting to listen to but a bit repetitive after some point. She talks about her appearance in ""Endgame"" as well.

Design Matrix: Basically, how the Borg were developed and their movie makeover. Includes the actual body pieces as well as ships and vessels.

The Story: Talks about the development of the story and the producers and writers work on defining what the movie was and what it means outside the fact that it's perhaps the best of the ""Next Generation"" films.

The Missile Silo: At first, boring, but it goes into the search that went on for a missle silo in the U.S. that they could film in. Talks about missle silos and their purpose during the Cold War. Very historical and interesting. Also, they reveal some secrets behind the silo scenes in the movie.

The Deflector Dish: I'm not sure why this was included but it simply talks about the deflector dish scene and how the design of the dish came about.

From ""A"" to ""E"": I thought perhaps this would talk about the creation of the new Enterprise but it doesn't. It's sort of a brief look at all the ships and some design points.

The Art of First Contact: Here, the design and concept of the new Enterprise-E is covered in detail. Also, some is given on the design of the Borg vessel and the Vulcan survey ship.

Borg Queen Assembly: Takes the audience step-by-step into how they shot the first appearance of the Queen. Very interesting if not revealing the secrets behind one of the most startling parts of the movie.

Escape Pad Launch: Again, not sure why this had to be included. It's short and is from the art director behind the short and brief launching of the escape pods.

Borg Queen's Demise: Short and to the point, revealing how they were able to show the fall and death of the Borg Queen in the film.

The DVD's extra features, similar to others, also includes storyboards, photo galleries, and two trailers (the bad teaser and the actual theatrical one). It also includes some easter eggs which includes Ethan Phillp's appearance as the bar owner in the Dixon Hill part and one that takes you through the changing titles that were considered before they settled on ""First Contact.""

This is definately worth the buy. You get a great film and features that fully explore the Borg. What I was impressed by is how the actors (except for Dorn) had a chance to comment on the film and different aspects of it. Stewart, Spiner and Frakes definately have a lot to say throughout all the features but so do McFadden and Siritis who thankfully are given a chance to show they are fully aware of what's going on and their roles. Sirtis steps up and talks about the changing Deanna Troi that we see in the films. Definately fun to listen to. I enjoyed the many connections and commentary given on the Borg as they appeared in ""Voyager"" and ""Enterprise."" Having footage woven in from Voyager's coverage of the Borg made the features stronger, in my opinion at least.

This is definately one movie you should own. It's perhaps one of the best Collector's Editions released yet and thus far the best of the TNG era films. Next up, ""Inssurection"" in a few months.",1110931200,6,6392,4.658969804618117

The film itself is a nice action filmwith a Star Trek twist, and a nice & interesting twist at that. It's only drawback is the fact that it does need some fimiliarity with the Star trek universe & mythology, which would make it very hard for non - trekkies to understand, enjoy, ad get into one of the most wonderful TV series ever!",1110412800,,662,4.382113821138211
869198,4,6304415346,"Well, my topic tittle pretty much says it all.  I believe this was the best movie that the TNG crew put out for a variety of reasons.

For one thing, it played upon the tv series's best episodes (Best of both world 1&2).  It also featured the Borg, while they were still cool and menacing - before they were made absolutely pathetic and neutered by the Voyager series which I think was the worst of the newer Treks, even worse than Enterprise.

Anyhow, the premise is your classic time travel to save the Earth from having its past altered.  Of course, it did seem silly, that the borg would go to all that trouble when technically, they should be able to take Earth quite easily if they really wanted to.

Still, the story of first contact is great cannon wise, because it shows the first time humans meet the vulcans.  It's nice to see this part explained, although you will end up wondering, so, it was only because of Picard and his crew that the Federation was born?  If you start dealing with time travel, then one usually gets into the muddy parts, like how their part in the past had already happened and they were merely replaying history, so technically their winning was already decided all along.

The movie has plenty of action, and was pretty well directed by Jonathan Frakes.  I've seen some of his other movies, and he's a decent director, when he's given a good script and a fairly sizeable budget.

The Data subplot is interesting too, since it really plays out the paragon between your deepest desires and whether one has the fortitude to reject them for the good of friends.

Overall, a very good movie that deserves to be in your collection, especially if you are a TNG fan.",1109721600,4,1695,4.521311475409836
869199,2,6304415346,"Looks like a great package for fans, but I've got real problems with this movie, given that they had 2 years in which to make it.

The teaser advert I saw on television looked suspenseful and gripping, and even gritty - all things I love.  Of course, it used music from The Wrath of Khan (which was an instant 'red flag' for me), but I didn't let it distract me.  I was hyped and eager to see this new film.

So, I went to the theatre to watch this flick...  didn't feel I needed to see it again.  (I saw VI 3 times, Generations 2 times, and Insurrection 3 times...  Nemesis 1 time and I nearly walked out, but that's for another review...) But because it was on clearance, I ultimately bought the LaserDisc edition in '99...

The good:

Jonathan Frakes' direction.  He really is good with camerawork.  Especially for the Borg intro, his direction is spot-on and even delivers the goods.  Overall, he's the right guy... but you can tell he had to do a LOT with some material that proved itself to be low quality fluff.

I'm glad they kept him for Insurrection, an eminently better produced film that, unusually for a Next Gen film, doesn't rely on its established lore and dares to tell a new story rather than feeding fans more of the same...  but I digress.

Picard/Borg subplot:  The Federation is proven right as Picard becomes more and more paranoid and is determined to exterminate the Borg at all costs.  (think of it as a reversal of ""The Wrath of Khan).  If only the movie spent more time on this aspect, because this was when the movie ditched all of the supposed 'ha-ha' moments and actually try to provide thrills and chills...  The Ruby/Picard confrontation is the zenith of this subplot and it is both sublime and superlative.

Special effects:  They're good.  But by 2005, people will re-visit the movie and think that the effects look cheap.  Then they'll try getting into the plot and some of them might ask ""Why did I like this slop?  That's why basing a movie on its effects never works; special effects always become dated.  The plot and characterizations don't.

The bad:

The Picard/Borg subplot:  Let's figure this out:  The Federaton gives Picard their new flagship and then tells Picard to go play tiddleywinks on the Romulan border just as the Borg invasion commences.  Now if the Federation execs can't trust Picard whenever a Borg dare spouts off the usual dreary dialogue drivel, why give him the supposedly best ship out there?!  Isn't that, well, dumb?

More intersting is this:  The ""E"" is situated at the Romulan border and the Borg strike.  They hear over subspace comm that the Feds are losing.  Picard and Data do their little song and joke and 'disobey orders' and head to Earth.  That's EARTH.  Hardly the neighbor of the Romulan neutral zone.  Even at warp 9.9, it's BOGUS to think for even one attosecond that they'd make it back in time to save the day.  This is very sloppy writing, and we're not beyond the first 10 minutes yet!!

Most interestingly of it all - given the previous statement, how come all the Federation ships instantly obey Picard who breaks orders (with Data being a 2nd rate Spock, no less in an awful so-called humorous moment) to go concentrate their firepower on the one area of the Borg ship?

And for a species that proclaims to be able to rapidly adapt, the Borg keep sending o n l y  o n e  c u b e  to take over the Federation.  Having been in tussle against the Federation before, you think they'd send TWO cube ships and be done with it, but nooooo.  Worse, the usual issue of conveniently being able to kill Borg in one scene, followed by a scene where they adapt, and then later another scene where lo and behold they can kill some more Borg again became tiresome.

Time travel.  How many more times do we need to see a sloppily written way to get everybody back in time.  Even better, with the Enterprise heavily damaged and having its deflector removed, I'd wonder HOW they could get back to the 24th century so easily...

""Watch you're future's end"" says the Queen.  Never mind that the Queen is totally incongrous with what we've been led to believe about the Borg in the past.  Her comment is stupid.  Picard and the gang have already ecounted the Borg and even have lives.  Had this scene been in the 24th century, it might be passable.  But with using time-travel (WHY?  There is no need to except to deliver us the means to add the Zephram Cochrane subplot which is utterly atrocious and pointless), this big phrase of hers loses all meaning because we already know they're going to win.  More sloppy writing, if there hadn't been enough at this point!

The comedy, it shouldn't be called 'humor':  Ever since Trek IV, Paramount seems intent on ensuring every Trek movie gets a huge dose of humor (except for 'Nemesis', which is ironically the biggest joke of them all...).  Guess what?  It ain't funny in this one.  It's so awful, it's even embarrasing in scenes.  This movie was presented to me as being a suspenseful adventure and what we truly got was this farce?!  Oobie doobie this!

The music.  Jerry Goldsmith is not at his best here.  One example is the Borg battle music's intro; it's B-material at best, overly pompous and embarrassing to listen to at worst.  Something about the music doesn't fit the movie.  Goldsmith's done better (namely the first Trek film)  What was wrong with Dennis McCarthy's style?  Or, better yet, why not get Ron Jones to do the music?  Oh yeah, he was fired because his style was too lively and engaging and didn't put people to sleep while watching the show.

Continuity flubs:  They exist in great numbers here.  Non-trekkies won't care because they won't see the goofs.  Trekkies who like the Kirk era WILL care.  (Obviously I prefer the Kirk era, generally, but Insurrection Special Edition hasn't been released yet...)  Fans of the Next Generation will love anything it all regardless. (try to sit through 'Nemesis' and you'll know quickly what I mean...)

Production flubs:  Barclay's toupee and some other trifling bits, there's a surprisingly good scene where Ruby is threatening Picard with a phaser.  He ultimately gets her to stand down, but when she hands him the phaser you can see it light up.  Why didn't Picard die as he did say it was set to kill?

And worst of all:  Cameos from two of Star Trek Voyager's cast for no reason:  The McCoy ripoff hologram doctor... and Neelix minus his makeup in the holodeck ballroom recreation.  Just when you thought that Michael Dorn's butting into Trek 6 was bad enough, now we get two from a far worse spinoff.  (not to dis Mr. Dorn, I rather liked how they were making continuity... and for once not wilfully breaking it, as can be seen in Generations and 1st Contact...)

Along with time travel, other bogus conveniences include how easy it is to turn off the holodeck safety mechanism (which should also mean that when one exits the holodeck, any bullets would also vanish, yes?)

Ultimately?  Go buy ""Generations"" instead.  It feels even more like an overlong TV episode, but despite its problems it's at least got the humor part done well.",1109376000,8,7122,4.612130885873903
869270,5,6304415346,"But this--this movie turned me from being a casual Trek fan into a huge Trek fan. I saw this movie in the local theater at a formative age, and I remeber being amazed not only by the remarkable visual effects and perfect dramatic pace, but also by the intelligent story and rich character study. It has been noted that Star Trek movies can often turn into long episodes you have to pay to watch, but this movie certainly can't be accused of that--it's bold, daring, and exciting, not to mention nearly perfect. Nearly--there are a few minor logical flaws in the plot, but this movie truly is space opera, and as with most opera, you have to suspend your disbelief a little.

The movie revolves around Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) battling the Borg physically and psychologically. After foiling a Borg plot to assimilate Earth, the Borg go back in time to stop a pivotal moment in Earth's history from occurring, thus making Humanity an easy target. So, it's up to the Enterprise crew to a) get history back on track and b) defeat the Borg. It could easily have been standard-issue thriller material, but it is intelligently handled, emphasizing the characters rather than the action. We see Picard go from the stoic renaissance man to revenge-obsessed Ahab, and Data from loyal officer to Sampson (with the terrific Alice Krige supplying the Delilah as the sensual Borg Queen). The planet-side sequences have their moments, too, but like all the Next Generation movies, this is the Picard and Data show, and for good reason--the actors' obvious talent at making characters they had played for near a decade come up with new facets to explore. It's certainly a trip.

Of all the Next Generation movies (heck, all the Trek movies, excepting Wrath of Khan), this movie is the most evenly paced and best plotted. Considering that this movie underwent half a dozen different shifts in what it was meant to be about--at one point it was going to take place in the middle ages and be called Star Trek: Renaissance--it's a testament to the actors and writers that the material never gets away from them--a temptation that proved all too powerful in the next installment (Insurrection). On the technical side, the direction from Jonathan Frakes (a.k.a. Commander Riker) is superlative--he manages to draw out Patrick Stewart's most complex performance as Picard, and the lighting, camerawork, and sound are all impeccable. The special effects, of course, are still impressive a decade later, thanks to George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic studios (this was the last Star Trek film they did). The Enterprise-E looks fabulous, and thankfully, there are no trips to Bronson Canyon in this movie (why do all the deserts in the Star Trek series look similar? Well...). Although it doesn't quite beat out the slightly more literate and philosophically dense Wrath of Khan for the title of Best Star Trek Movie, it finishes a solid second in my book. If you only buy one Star Trek movie, buy Wrath of Khan. But if you buy two, buy this one in addition to Wrath of Khan. You'll be really glad you did.",1107561600,7,3101,4.849056603773585
869271,4,6304415346,"I have come to expect, after a bunch of great Trek double DVD's with awesome features and bonus material and Okuda's hilarious and respectful commentary (and a million other both entertaining and educational pieces), to see perhaps the greatest Trek film of all with all the great features. I realize there is no need for a director's cut since the film really is perfect as is, but I would like to see how Frakes worked in putting it together - this movie has several threads, woven together with the skill of a master and the love of the Star Trek dream. (And anyone who is tired of Data's search for humanity can just watch the Kirk crew forever, without a thought to what Rodenberry wanted: a increasingly brighter future wrought from the struggle and suffering of our beloved characters. Kirk struggled to his proper end admirably, and with significant fan input.) They are taking too long between films, which suggests that perhaps film itself is the wrong venue for the TNG crew to continue into the 21st century. This one may be the last of that type to really work because the next two just didn't cut it and the ""last"" one was not even in the Trek spirit and actually ended with a suicide! Ugh! I would suggest an HBO mini-series (or several-part ""film"") for the smaller screen since the small screen are getting bigger and better and concessions do not have to be made for young teens (unless they, too, are true trekkers, who want a good production such as this). The ""action"" in ""First Contact"" makes sense, and does not draw attention to itself, but simply works to make a better picture. I agree, maybe these actors do not want to get so old that they ""outlive their usefulness"" and perhaps ""First Contact"" might be a great send-off itself, but since it was not, we need first, a good, goodie-filled double-DVD of ""First Contact"" packed with extras, and then a grand finale worthy of Rodenberry's vision (as is ""First Contact,"" of course).

Once this is released with two full DVD's packed with bonus goodies, it gets five stars!

All the best to the future!

869272,5,6304415346,"""First Contact"" is the eighth Star Trek film, and hit the movie screens in 1996. Directed by Jonathon Riker (Will Riker), it was the first in the series of movies to focus solely on the crew of the Next Generation. Following the events of ""Generations"", it was also the first to feature the Sovereign-class Enterprise-E.

The film opens in 2373, as the Borg launch their second invasion of Federation space. The Borg are a ruthless and highly adaptable enemy. Part organic, part machine, each drone is connected to a single hive mind - allowing for no individual reasoning, thought or action. Their quest for perfection has led them to assimilate thousands of other civilisations into their collective. Their first invasion - 6 years previously - had been covered in the TNG episodes ""The Best of Both Worlds"" Parts 1 and 2. During that invasion, Captain Picard himself had been assimilated and renamed Locutus of Borg. He was eventually freed from the Collective, though there are certain scars he still carries.

As a result of Picard's previous ordeal, Starfleet's top brass order the Enterprise to stay away from the battlefield. Picard, however, disobeys the order, and takes command of the fleet engaging the Borg Cube. The knowledge he gained as Locutus allows the Starfleet vessels to destroy the invading ship, though not before the launch of a smaller sphere-shaped vessel. This vessel creates a temporal vortex and disappears into the past, with the Enterprise following in its wake. The two ships emerge in 2063, close to Earth - the day before the legendary Zephram Cochrane's first warp flight. This flight led to the first meeting of Humans and Vulcans, which eventually led to the formation of the Federation. The Borg mean to prevent this flight - in doing so, the Federation will never have existed and will allow the easy assimilation of Earth. Picard divides his command crew - some, led by Riker and Troi, work on the surface to ensure the success of Cochrane's flight. Picard, however, leads the fight against a group of Borg who have invaded the Enterprise.

""First Contact"" is my favorite of the Trek movies. There's plenty of action and humor - not only do the Enterprise officers have to battle the best 'bad guys' in the Star Trek universe, they also have to deal with Tequila, Rock 'n' Roll and a very different Zephram Cochrane to the one they learnt about in school. It also shows a very different side to the usually diplomatic Picard and a very clear route for Data to become more human.",1097539200,7,2519,4.8399071925754065

 Patrick Stewart is always a command presence as Capt.

And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations.

 A great battle scene with the Borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes alternating between 2063 earth and a war zone with the Borg on the new Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all too convienient TV ending.

869275,5,6304415346,"STAR TREK - FIRST CONTACT (1996), being only the second film to feature the ""Next Generation"" characters---and the first one without any of the originals---is a masterpiece of suspense, drama and violence. Easily earning its PG-13 rating, this one deals with (as I'm sure all who are reading this know) the Borg attempting to conquer Earth by going back in time to prevent ""first contact"" between humans and Vulcans. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard (the wonderful Patrick Stewart), who had once been ""assimilated"" by the Borg, being renamed Locutus in the process, takes this particularly hard and makes it his professional duty as Captain of the Federation Starship Enterprise 1701-C, and his personal duty as a member of the human race, to stop the Borg from attaining its goal.
This entry in the series, directed by Jonathan Frakes (Commander Will Riker), is a full step-up from the original series, employing dazzling visual effects and taking on a decidedly darker tone than previous STAR TREK films. It also ramps up the dramatic tension big-time, as Capt. Picard is so deeply affected by his previous experience with the Borg; his hatred is not just for what the Borg collective is, it's also a result of what the Borg collective had made of him, if only briefly. Meeting him head-on in his anguished tension are an unlikely stowaway (the equally wonderful Alfre Woodard) and the unlikely inventor of the Warp Drive Dr. Zefram Cochrane (the inspired James Cromwell). Of course, series regulars Lt. Commander Worf (Michael Dorn), Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) are back in fine form, as are Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden). We even get a brief prize of a cameo appearance of The Doctor (Robert Picardo) from the ""Star Trek: Voyager"" series. But the one who really steals the show is the evil Borg Queen (Alice Krige), who slyly exudes mechanical sensuality even as she provokes danger and disdain (and perhaps disgust). Her kidnapping of the android Data and insinuation into his deep-seated desire to ""become more human"" makes for possibly the scariest scene in the entire movie.
STAR TREK - FIRST CONTACT combines an immense amount of elements in order to make its unified whole. The result is a stark, darkly brilliant film that comes close to sensory overload at times. True, Capt. Picard's climactic head-butting scene with the sharp-tongued stowaway Lily goes dangerously over-the-top at one point (and eventually would be parodied in the hilarious ""Fingerbang"" episode of ""South Park""), but it STILL works. Everything else in this film does, too. Jonathan Frakes did a splendid job in creating the highest-budget STAR TREK film yet (a reported $80 million) in record time, earning himself the nickname ""Two-Takes Frakes"" from his fellow cast members and the admiration of a new generation of STAR TREK fans. Also, he earned well over the magical $100 million mark for film studio Paramount, making the studio moguls happy in the process! Unfortunately, he couldn't quite match this success with the next series installment, the lighter-toned STAR TREK - INSURRECTION (1998); however, with this film, Jonathan Frakes achieved something of a series masterpiece, of which he should always be proud. Don't get me wrong; I loved STAR TREK GENERATIONS (1994), but in STAR TREK - FIRST CONTACT, the ""Next Generation"" crew hold their own, and our complete undivided attention, for the nearly-two-hour film. This would easily be the greatest of the ""Next Generation"" movies, and quite possibly, the best in the entire franchise.

869276,5,6304415346,"I feel that this movie is as good a movie sequel to the two part ""The Best of Both Worlds"" episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation  as Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn was to ""Space Seed"" in the original Star Trek.  In this movie, the Borg Collective, led by their sadistic Queen (Alice Krige) (who once captured Jean-Luc Picard in the ""The Best Of Both Worlds"" and converted him to be one of their own), returns to try to take over Earth.  The crew of the Enterprise-E must go back in time to prevent The Borg from altering Earth's history to suit their purposes.  The Borg try to change the timeline of history by trying to prevent the inventor of the Warp Drive, Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell), from flying his warp-capable spaceship.  By the way, the Zefram Cochrane in this movie is totally different from the character portrayed by Glenn Corbett in the ""Metamorphosis"" episode of  the original Star Trek.
The Special Effects in this movie were outstanding.  The action sequences I felt were superbly done, especially the fight between the Borg Queen and Picard. There was great acting by all involved, including Patrick Stewart, James Cromwell, and Alfrie Woodard. Alice Krige was exceptional as the Borg Queen..
The picture quality in this DVD was excellent. Sound quality was also very good.

Weak moments?  Deanna.  Marina Sirtis is just a lousy actress, and her bad delivery and semi-comatose performance (her best scene is one in which she's dead drunk) take away more than they should from the movie.  But that's a small complaint for such a great action movie.

869279,5,6304415346,"Even though Star Trek: Generations was a good first entry in The Next Generation era of feature films, it wasn't until Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga wrote Star Trek: First Contact's story and screenplay that Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew proved that they could carry a Trek film without help from The Original Series' cast.
It also helped that the film was more action-oriented than Star Trek VII.  Sure, the last battle of the NCC-1701 D was impressive and the brief meeting of Captains James T. Kirk (William Shatner) and Picard did provide Trek fans with some exciting and moving moments, but what fans really wanted was a muscular...action movie with a mission (and antagonists) worthy of the Next Generation crew and the new, top-of-the line Enterprise E.
Star Trek: First Contact brings back the Borg, a race of half-organic, half cybernetic beings whose goal is to destroy other races by assimilating their technology and transforming the survivors by injecting microscopic nanoprobes that turn humans, Vulcans, El-Aurians -- anyone, really -- into unfeeling, relentless drones.  As fans of the 1987-1994 syndicated series know, Capt. Picard was once captured by the Borg and transformed into Locutus, a Borg strategist/spokesdrone whose intimate knowledge of Starfleet technology,its tactics and its officers nearly spelled certain defeat for the Federation at the Battle of Wolf 359.
Now, several years later, the Borg are back and meaner than ever.  Having been thwarted more than once in the 24th Century by Picard and his crew, the Borg Queen (Alice Krige) leads a single-cubeship invasion force into Federation space, hoping to defeat the Federation by either conquering Earth in a battle against Starfleet...or tinkering with the timeline and going back to the 21st Century to prevent humanity's first contact with another spacefaring race.
Actor Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr. Will Riker) makes his feature film directing debut in this eighth installment of the Star Trek movie series, and although he would only direct the weaker Star Trek: Insurrection, he does a great job at helming a very high-octane action flick that involves time travel, space battles, a strong Picard/Data storyline and elements from The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and the then-still new Voyager.
Guest stars James Cromwell (The Sum of All Fears, Babe) and Alfre Woodward join the cast of TNG as warp-drive inventor Zefram Cochrane and his friend and assistant Lily, who add a certain mixture of edginess and wit to the film.  Cromwell fares particularly well as Cochrane, a character first seen in The Original Series episode Metamorphosis. While Cromwell doesn't remotely look like the then-30 or 40-something Glen Corbett, he portrays the legendary ""father of warp drive"" as a very human and flawed genius -- he is cranky, cynical and drinks way too much -- who is bemused by the hero-worship he receives from the Enterprise crew.  He also gets some of the best lines. (My favorite: ""You're astronauts...on some kind of star trek?"")
Also contributing to the excitement is Jerry Goldsmith's score, a mixture of a lovely new main theme and such familiar touchstones as Alexander Courage's fanfare for the Original Series theme and Goldsmith's own ""Main Theme"" for Star Trek's first feature film (and later adapted as The Next Generation's main title).
Although First Contact does require some familiarity with the Star Trek universe and its history, it's clearly among the best of the 10 in the series.",1073865600,76,3546,5.1923076923076925

869384,5,6304415346,"(...) I liked Star Trek First Contact and it's one of the best things Star Trek has ever done.
First Contact is the continuing adventures of the crew of the Enterprise from TNG series. The crew must go back in time and stop the cybernetic species The Borg. The Borg are trying to stop Zepryham Cochran. The man who developed warp drive and established first contact. If stoped it could be catostrophic to the futre of the Enterprise and of the federation.
The cast from The Next Generation is fantastic. They all had there specific talents that added to the show. They all shine in First Contact.
Patrick Stewart is great. He is one of the most underrated actors of all-time. He is a former Shakesperian actor and he can flat out act. He wasn't always given the best work in Star Trek and this is some of his finest work he has ever done.
Jonathan Frakes is great. Not only does he continue his role as Cmdr. Riker but he directed the film. He uses the suspense and unkown of the Borg well. He really does add to there race with what he does with them in the movie. He's funny as Riker and is less of the playboy that Riker is in the show.
Brent Spiner is great as well. It's a shame he hasn't done a lot more out of Star Trek. He really gets into his characters well and plays them well. Data is one of the most beloved characters in Star Trek and the film really shows why.
Levar Burton has a great role in the film. He plays Geordi well in what has become his signature role. He's argueably the most successful man ouside of Star Trek with his role on Reading Rainbow and from the hit mini series Roots. It's great to see Geordi without that stupid visor he had the show. I love his optical implants.
I love the score Jerry Goldsmith wrote for this film. I think it's the best work he's ever done. I think it got jipped at the Oscars. The woodwind and horns are beautiful in the theme. If your a classical music fan you should love the score.
Star Trek Fist Contact is one of the best Star Trek films ever made. Fans outside of Star Trek should like it. You don't have to be a trekkie to understand the film which really helps it a lot. It's a must for anybody that calls themself a Trekkie and I think all Sci-Fi fans should see it.

There are humorous scenes: an exasperated Riker trying to talk with a 21st century Zephram Cochrane while a drunken Troi passes out; a blearly-eyed first warp-drive mission accompanied by Steppenwolf, a Captain jealous of Mr. Data's ability to turn off his emotions when frightened, and a angry Klingon telling a Borg precisely what he can assimilate.
There is increadible action and suspense: a fight against the (nearly) unstoppable Borg as they colonize the Enterprise, a race to protect humanity's past and secure its future.
There is real character conflict.  Captain Picard gets angrier than ever as he faces his own consuming drive to destroy the Borg.
A smart movie, and a fun one, too.  It seems that Star Trek always succeeds when it takes its cues from Melville.

I don't espcially like the new Enterprise, looks too cartoonish next to the refited Enterprise and Enterprise-A. And I didn't like the devellopment of the Borg.

869390,4,6304415346,"In 13 words: Star Trek First Contact is the best film of the ""Next Generation"" movies. It has superb plotting, pacing, acting, humor, and the BEST special effects of ANY of the films, even surpassing the newest Star Trek Nemesis. (This is the last Trek movie where the special effects were done by ILM). The only problem with this film is that it could've been the best Trek movie out of them ALL if not for a major pitfall...
Basically, the action scenes are way too underdeveloped. Each action scene consists of about 5 (or less) phaser shots and that's it. The ship battle at the beginning is something to behold, but all of the other action scenes just bum out. The zero-gravity battle on the hull of the Enterprise E is VERY SUBDUED compared to the scene read in the script. (In the script, there is a MASSIVE, 10 page battle where Riker and Worf must realign a Quantaum Torpedo and fight off dozens of Borg who are firing at them.) In the move, all we get is a very slow-paced scene where the only highlight is Worf saying ""A S S I M I L A T E  T H I S ! !
Another problem is the ending. It's too dang boring. Picard displays incredible acting ability in a 5 minute scene were he throws stuff around in his ready room and gets ready to make a final stand against the Borg. We get the idea that there's going to be a massive climax, but instead all we get is Data punching a tube and Picard climbing on metal ""rope things."" Not very exciting.
If the film had been about 10 minutes longer, (allowing for more action) this would've been a PERFECT STAR TREK FILM. So all in all, if you want a good solid Trek film with good acting, plotting, special effects humor, etc., see this one. I you want to see a Trek film with tons of action and a massive climax, I suggest you see Nemesis instead.
Don't get me wrong: I'm a trekkie and I own all of the Trek movies. First Contact is one of my all-time favorite Star Trek movies, but it just left me with a little bit more to be desired.

869485,4,6304415346,"What fan can ever forget the introduction of the Borg into the Star Trek universe?  When Picard was captured and assimilated by the Borg, I was beside myself with wonder, giddiness, and disbelief.  The ultimate Star Trek: TNG movie really had to feature mankind's most dangerous enemy in a battle for Earth.  Not only does First Contact give us this, it actually gives us a battle for earth's past as well as its future.  I don't really know how to judge a director's performance, but Jonathan Frakes certainly knows as much about these beloved characters as anyone and he unquestionably succeeds in giving rabid Star Trek: TNG fans the kinds of thrills, nostalgia, and excitement they crave.  I must admit, though, that while this is an excellent movie for newcomers as well as long-time fans, there are a few little things about it that bother me.
Who am I to question things in the Star Trek universe?  No one, yet I still believe this movie fell short of its potential.  For one thing, and this is something that afflicts almost all reunion movies of any kind, there is an overindulgence of enlightening comedic episodes and clich&eacute;s among a cast we already know so well: we see Deanna Troi get drunk, the first words out of Worf's mouth are ""Perhaps today is a good day to die"" when his ship is crippled, we watch Data's sometimes magnified efforts to become human, we hear a holograph in the sick bay tell Dr. Crusher that ""I'm a doctor, not a doorstop,"" etc.  Every so often, two characters look at each other knowingly as they enjoy some type of private joke that many but not all TNG fans will really ""get.""  I don't really mind all this, but sometimes it just seems a little much.  It can be funny, but there's just a little too much of it.  I was also chagrined by the omniscience of Picard when a Borg pod of some sort left the ship headed for Earth; hearing that the pod was producing some kind of unusual effects in front of it, Picard almost immediately knows that the Borg are traveling back in time in order to change the future.
The only substantive thing that bothers me about this movie is the portrayal of the Borg.  I actually think the Borg were given a wrong turn back during the TV series when one of them was cut off from the collective and began to recognize himself as an individual.  As far as this movie goes, I think it was a great mistake to invent a ""queen"" who somehow gave birth to the Borg and claims that ""she"" (not ""we"") is Borg.  An individual consciousness lying atop the command structure of a hive mentality greatly weakens the threat of the Borg and humanizes them in a small way that bothers me (humanization implies vulnerability).  Maybe this is why the Borg fail pretty miserably with Plan A of their time travel strategy.
Although I may have harped on them a little bit, these really are rather trifling criticisms that do not make this movie any less enjoyable than it is; I just think it could have been better.  It's always nice to see the cast of the show get together again for a new adventure, especially when it involves the Borg.  There is a nice dichotomy midway through the film; ironically, we hear the determined Captain Picard basically echoing the words of the Borg queen on the subjects of evolution and progress in life.  This thinnest of threads tying the Borg and Federation together seems to lie buried in much of the remaining story, giving it a deeper meaning of some significance.  A more obvious message concerns the reality vs. the legend of heroes.  Warp drive inventor Dr. Cromwell, long-time hero and demi-god to future generations, is basically just a greedy, regular, frequently intoxicated guy.  This helps make First Contact a very good, but not great, motion picture.",1046995200,2,3753,4.613533834586466

869487,5,6304415346,"First Contact is the ""event"" motion picture highlight of the Star Trek series. After so many films and so many years, the series finally achieves the lauded standards that could rival and even surpass other big-screen sci-fi adventures. What we have here is a mostly terrific and exciting adventure, filled with superior special effects and an engaging, complex plot to boot.
First Contact wastes no time getting into the thick of action. A borg ship (shaped like a cube and incredibly massive in size) is heading toward Earth and an all-out space battle ensues, with the Enterprise-E at the helm. With Captain Jean-Luc Picard's (Patrick Stewart) intimate knowledge of this cyborg race, the fleet destroys the ship, but a small pod is jettisoned, which then travels back in time and alters the course of human history, where Earth in the future will be completely inhabited by the Borg. Determined to prevent this nightmarish future from taking place, the Enterprise-E enters the time rip and must battle the Borg in the year 2063, the dawn of interstellar space travel.
The question for non Trek-fans is whether they'll like the movie. My advice is to watch a few of the Borg episodes and catch up on the previous film to get a feel for all the characters. Otherwise, they'll probably be baffled by the large cast and all the in-house references. But for everyone else, First Contact will play as first-rate escapist entertainment, a sci-fi thrill ride packed with action, suspense, humor, and even genuinely touching drama.
First and foremost, part of what makes the suspense so palpable is because the crew is facing the Borg, undeniably the best villains of the entire Star Trek canon. For those who know next to nothing about this alien race, they exist by assimilating other species into a collective whole, a hive if you will. They show and feel no fear, and that lack of expression can be quite creepy. As far as their appearances go, it's basically organic flesh with lots of cybernetic and machine parts grafted on. I'm not sure how the assimilation process works, but I'd suspect it's not too dissimilar from a virulent attack.
It's arguable that First Contact is the most consistently exciting Trek film to date. This one works as a pure thriller, with several standout action setpieces. Getting things off to a rollicking start is the fast-paced and tense opening space battle, complete with dozens of Starfleet ships attacking the giant Borg cube. Later encounters with the Borg on board the Enterprise (they're assimilating the ship deck-by-deck) are exciting and even a little frightening. You even get to see Data (the android) crushing the Borg with his bare hands, a physical display that he doesn't show too often. The film's best and most suspenseful sequence is the zero-g battle set on the hull of the ship.
First Contact is not without its problems. Easily the most significant flaw of the film are the scenes set on Earth. While vital plot-wise, these moments serve to interrupt the tense action on board the Enterprise. Thankfully, these parts only represent a minor portion of the film. Another problem, for me at least, is that Star Trek was often at its best when the crew set courses for alien planets or star systems. Virtually all of First Contact is set within a short distance to Earth, so that sense of awe and adventure is a bit lacking.
Then there's the climax, which is suspenseful and exciting, but it's a little abrupt and might come as a deus ex machina to some viewers. For those who want their space adventures to end with a huge bang, the twenty-five minute space battle finale to Star Trek: Nemesis might be more up their alley. One of the biggest flaws of Nemesis was that it was often too talky, and there's also a lot of talk going on in First Contact. The difference is that, here, the dialogue accentuates and even heightens the suspense, as we're always made aware of the stakes and dangers on-hand.
Acting-wise, First Contact is unsurprisingly solid. considering the cast has been in these roles for years. Patrick Stewart is the best here, delivering a riveting, power-house performance. The scene where he argues why the Enterprise should stay and fight as opposed to fleeing is simply the best piece of acting in the entire series, period. Brent Spiner is excellent as Data, a role he's fitted so comfortably in, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the part. The other most significant role belongs to Alfre Woodard as a tough, 21st century woman who finds herself lost on board the Enterprise. The writers cleverly make her both an engaging character and an effective device for which to explain more confusing plot-points (to non-Trek fans, that is) and Trek history.
Directed by Jonathan Frakes (who also plays the part of Commander Riker), the man displays a supremely confident hand behind the camera. Visually, this one breaks the mold from its predecessors. The atmosphere and lighting are darker, and there's even an improved uniform change for the entire crew (obviously done only for aesthetic purposes, but who's complaining?). Too bad success wouldn't be repeated with the gag-inducing Star Trek: Insurrection. The Next Generation films have overall been successful from a quality filmmaking point-of-view. And without a doubt, First Contact represents a pinnacle for this often innovative franchise.

869488,5,6304415346,"Reviewer: Reginald D. Garrard from Camilla, GA USA
Space battles and political intrigue may abound in contemporary sci-fi but the characters portrayed onscreen are remembered long after the last explosion or assassination occurs. ""First Contact"", the second feature with the cast of the ""Next Generation"" series stands out because of the brilliance of Patrick Stewart, Alfre Woodard, Alice Krige, and Oscar nominee James Cromwell. The verbal bouts between Stewart's ""Picard"" and Woodard's ""Lilly"" are flawless; Krige's seductive and malevolent Borg queen is villainy at its best; and Cromwell deftly portrays Zephraim Cochran, a scientist torn between his desire to complete the initial warp drive test and the adoration bestowed on him by the futuristic crew for his achievements.

Trek has always been more than just a story about space exploration; it is a tale of humanity and its ongoing improvement. The film shows all that is good about mankind, even if it's in the guise of a space opera.",1040515200,,996,5.264150943396227
869489,2,6304415346,"I am most definitely a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and was one of the people there on opening weekend for each movie as it was released in theaters.
After the bomb that was Star Trek: Generations, I was hoping they'd improve and give us a movie with quality worthy of being an adventure with the TNG crew.  But wishing doesn't make it so.
This movie gives us our first glimmer of the new Enterprise E, to replace the 1701-D, destroyed at the end of Generations.  It is a pretty ship, worthy of the TNG crew, though a little less luxurious looking, and more functional.
It's going to be tested quickly, also, as Picard and crew are forced to face their toughest enemy from the past, the Borg collective, which seems to have become obsessed with taking over Earth and assimilating humanity.  Only this time, they've decided to attack from a new angle - launching themselves into Earth's past, to assimilate humanity before they have the technology to resist.
A Borg cube manages to get to Earth, and launches a capsule at the planet, which heads back in time to when Cochrane was about to test the first warp drive - and make first contact with the Vulcans, bringing humanity into the level of a true space-faring race.  The Enterprise attempts to chase down the capsule, and gets pulled back in time along with it, offering them a chance to prevent the Borg from destroying Cochrane, and keeping the planet from becoming just another part of the Borg collective.
So the crew must convince Cochrane to test the warp drive, after the Borg attack the launch site.  During all of this, the Enterprise is slowly being consumed by the Borg, crew members becoming resources for the Borg, as the ship is assimilated, and the Borg try to erect a beacon to draw the collective of that era to Earth.
Overall, it seems like a great, quality Star Trek adventure.  Until you take a few minutes and evaluate the plot.
Simply put, there is no reason that the Borg have to come to Earth to launch the capsule into the past.  This could just as easily be done by the Borg launching the capsule into the past with all the information they have, only doing it at a planet they controlled at that point in the past also.  Thus, they could tell the Borg of the past about Earth, and a cube could zip over to assimilate Earth at any point in the past they wanted.
Of course, this same technology would allow them to create an infinite loop of feedback - learn something, send it into the past Collective, which can integrate that into their knowledge before the original point at which they'd learned it, allowing them to learn something else instead, and so on.  Meaning they could concievably learn everything they could possibly learn just by going through as many iterations of the loop as needed.
What does it all mean?  Simply, that the whole concept is fundamentally flawed - that if the Borg had that ability of time travel, to use it in the manner done in the movie makes very little sense.
All in all, it means a possibly good movie is ruined by an unacceptably large plot hole.  If you want your movie without gaping flaws in the story, well, look elsewhere.",1039996800,,3156,4.538732394366197

The visuals are amazing and the action is the best in the series. From the first space battle to the Borg invading the ship to the deflector dish battle to the final showdown, this movie has a fast pace as well as rich characters. Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Riker, is a talented director who directed some of the best episodes of ""The Next Generation"" TV series. He keeps this movie flowing and the action frequent. But most of all, this movie has heart and deep concern for its characters. That's what ""Star Trek"" is all about.",1033689600,,946,4.704819277108434

869583,5,6304415346,"First Contact is absolutely great! It involves the Borg making another run for earth. Starfleet feels that Captain Picard would not be helpful in the situation and orders the new Enterprise-E to patrol the Romulan Neutral Zone. Picard is hearing the Borg and knows what they're planning. He disobeys orders and heads straight for the battle. When they arrive, the battle is afoot; the USS Defiant from Deep Space Nine commanded by Lt. Commander Worf is fighting valiantly and losing. Captain Picard determines the proper strategy to destroy the cube and coordinates it perfectly. Just before the cube is destroyed, the Borg launch a smaller vessel and it heads straight for earth, opening a time portal the past. Captain Picard orders the Enterprise in. What follows is clearly one of the best Star Trek films to date. We see cameo's from Robert Picardo as the EMH, Ethan Phillips (Neelix from Voyager and Barclay makes an appearance. Overall an extremely well written story and directed perfectly by none other Jonathan Frakes (Commander William T. Riker). In the best tradition of the Gene Roddenberry ethos and the other even numbered movies that can be watched over and over again. Nods to Alice Krige who does a very good villain in the Borg Queen.

869584,4,6304415346,"One of the strongest Trek films, First Contact is also flawed. Clearly there was footage cut from the film prior to release. Like Wrath of Khan, First Contact would benefit from a director's cut restoring some scenes. There are a number of scenes where the transitions are a bit awkward and it's clear that more character development and exposition is missing from this film than some of the other films in The Next Generation series.
While recycling the Moby Dick motif has received much criticism (it was used to great effect in Wrath of Khan), it works perfectly in First Contact. Picard's cool, controlled persona finally cracks here and for good reason; his character underwent emotional trauma. It's only natural that he would respond with anger and frustruation. Sure, we expect reason from Picard's character but this actually contributes to the Picard.
All of the characters benefit from the expanded screen time although, again, it does feel like there is more missing. Perhaps it was sacrificed to keep the pace of the film. Regardless, it wouldn't hurt to restore it to its rightful place. After all, it benefited Nicholas Meyer's Wrath and (for the most part)the reediting on ST:TMP also helped clarify and improve the narrative flow.
First Contact was an improvement over Generations. While that film is solid and entertaining, it always felt that it was made for television and not for the big screen. The epic element always has worked well for Trek when the big screen adventures were made. The same holds true here as well. With Nemesis coming out in December it's time that Paramount and director Jonathon Frakes return to First Contact and let it live up to its five star potential.",1030924800,5,1702,4.933797909407666
869585,4,6304415346,"This review is for the VHS version not the DVD version.
First contact is the first star trek movie to feature just the next generation cast. The story begins with another invasion of our fun loving (resistence is futile) friends the Borg. Starfleet is cautious about Captain Picard being involved with the battle because he was simulated by the borg (Best of both worlds). Starfleet is loosing bad so Picard takes over the fleet and destroys the borg cube. The cube releases a probe that goes back in time to prevent the first human contact with aliens. The crew notices that the Earth has been completely simulated by the Borg. The Enterprise then goes back in time to stop the Borg and Find Zeffrem Cochrane (Played by James Cromwell of ""Babe""). They go to ensure that he makes his historic warp flight. But in the meantime the borg have turned the enterprise into their own personal hive. There a side story of the frienship forming between Cochrane's assistant Lilly (Played by Alfre Woodard of ""Miss Evers Boys"")amd captain Picard. Picard becomes obssed with destroying the Borg that he would risk his own crew. A key scene is where lilly compares Captain Picard to Captain Ahab of ""Moby Dick"". Picard then relizes his efforts are futile. In the meantime the Borg Queen, played by Alice Krige, Tries to get Data to destroy Cochrane's ship. Well Data doesn't destroy the ship. The Vulcans see thee the ship and realizes that humams have obtained Warp Flight and to decide to make first contact. The scene were the volcan ship landing and the volcans making contact with the humans is similar to the contact scene in ""Close Encounters of the third kind."" This movie shows why humans and vulcans have a close relationship. This movie eventually became the basis for the series ""Enterprise"" that takes places ninety years later. Gene Roddenberry's utopian vision of the future has become a pop cultural phenomenon. First Contact is a magnificent portrayal of the first steps toward that new world. When Picard leaves to return to the enterprise Lilly says she enies the world he is returning to. Picard says he is envious of her because she is able to witness the early steps that will become his world.",1029628800,,2204,4.78740157480315

The plot, action and characterizations are all first-rate. Combining the NG crew's arch-enemy, the Borg, plus mankind's first warp drive space venture, as well as time travel, makes for a solid adventure.
Picard, Worf and Data, perhaps the NG crew's most interesting members, are given ample time to shine in this movie. Guest stars James Cromwell and Alfre Woodard provide top-notch Earth-bound support.

This movie does it all. As someone who can very honestly say he's seen every movie along with every episode of all five series, I can say they stayed true to the ever growing timeline. Patrick Stewart has a superb performance, as does the rest of the crew. Troi and Riker both add some comedic relief at the right times, along with a wonderfully cast James Cromwell as Zefram Cochran.
After the many failures of Generations, from a weak plot, to it coming off as a giant episode of The Next Generation, rather than a movie, to the absolutely useless and pathetic killing of the Great James T. Kirk, First Contact rectifies the previous injustices and goes all out.
You wanna know what really made it work, look no farther than the director's credit. Frakes could easily be one of the top director's in Hollywood.",1028332800,,976,4.614942528735632
869588,5,6304415346,"After I felt mild disappointment with ""Generations,"" I had hoped that a film devoted entirely to the Next Gen cast might work better.  My wish came true, as ""First Contact"" is TNG's best film so far (we'll have to see how ""Nemesis"" turns out).
Director/star Jonathan Frakes knew his cast and his audience as he had directed several great episodes of the television series.  The film is a nice even mix of spooky suspense, gore (a new addition to the Star Trek movie universe), and a bit of humor.  It's a breakthrough story for the character of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart).  The usually collected captain becomes livid with revenge.  I will only say that.  I'm not going to draw out the description of the plot for you.  Plenty of other reviews on this site slice it up for you.  I will simply say that it's a great story involving one of the most destructive Federation enemy races, the Borg.
The cast is superb, as almost always.  Some fans have not been happy with the portrayal of Zephram Cochrane (James Cromwell).  I thought he was quite good.  Besides, if Cochrane had been the easy going, caring, thoughtful individual, there would have been no conflict between him and the Enterprise crew.  Conflicts keep stories going, not simple solutions.
Alice Krige was icy and scary as the Borg Queen.  Everytime I see her in another movie or on television, I keep envisioning her with her floating, slimy, bald Borg head.  She must have been that good, huh?
Needless to say, there were plenty of eye catching special effects and new Enterprise-E gadgets (zero gravity boots, a holographic medical assistant) to please sci-fi buffs.  If there were historical discrepancies (as in Star Trek history), I didn't notice.  I'm a fan of the show, but I'm not one of those people who breaks out the ""Star Trek Companion"" to find contradictions.  It happens sometimes, and I just deal with it.  No offense to die-hard fans, though.
The DVD offers nice picture and sound, but only a trailer for a special feature.  This makes me a little mad because I know there was at least an HBO-First Look special.  I think Paramount's just waiting to release a special edition so they can make more money.  Typical.
But in the meantime, it's a great movie: gritty, action-packed, and even funny.  Trek fans enjoy...and pray with me that ""Nemesis"" continues the tradition of ""FC.""",1027900800,,2372,4.776412776412776

869590,5,6304415346,"This is my favorite Star Trek movie of all nine currently on the market... This movie's got everything you could want.
 The acting is great, most notably from Patrick Stewart as the valiant Captain Picard, Alfre Woodard as Lily Sloane, and Alice Krige as the perfectly creepy Borg Queen. Nearly all of the crewmembers got good lines and moments (the only one whom I think was a bit stiffed was Crusher, but its always like that somehow), especially Deanna Troi. If you want a laugh, watch Chapter 12, it's great. Picard got some absolutely awesome lines and the scene between him and Lily in the readyroom is powerful stuff.
 Of course, the Borg are stupendous in this movie. They're downright scary at times, and the special effects have just the right amount of gruesomeness. Alice Krige as the Borg Queen is mysterious and creepy and plays off well with Picard and Data.
 Although it was a bit off-putting to some, Zefram Cochrane was portrayed as a drunk ""hoodlum"" more interested in money and wealth than scientific progress. His performance is interesting and the joke about ""taking a leak"" with Geordi is very funny.
 All in all, this was a great movie. It starts off right away with action, has fabulous acting, the lines are emotional, the humor is not forced or overdone, and, of course, the Borg make it just scary enough so that you may sleep with the lights on.
Best scenes: Deanna and Cochrane bum out over tequila, the assimilation sequence when the Borg are gunning down all of the defense checkpoints, the conversation between Lily and Picard in his ready-room, and Crusher's escape from sickbay.
Best lines: ""It's a primitive culture. I'm just trying to blend in."" ""You're blended, all right."" (Deanna and Will)
 ""If you want my professional opinion as ship's counselor: he's nuts."" (Deanna)
 ""I'm a doctor, not a doorstop."" (EMH/Voyager's doctor)
 ""They destroy our ships, and we fall back. They conquer entire worlds, and we fall back. But not this time, the line must be drawn HERE."" (Picard)
 ""Don't you people from the twenty-fourth century ever pee?"" (Zefram Cochrane)
Rated PG-13 for language, sci-fi violence (phasers), and sensuality (Data and the Borg Queen, eeww).
Special features: Two trailers (theatrical and teaser) and different selections in language. Watch it in French, its a riot. And look for glimpses of the Enterprise-D, ""Generations"", and the episode ""Best of Both Worlds"" in the teaser trailer.",1027209600,,2437,4.955882352941177

869712,5,6304415346,"It would not be right for me to review a Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) movie without first making a disclaimer: I am very bias. I love TNG, and it would be almost impossible for them to make a movie that I wouldn't absolutely love.
That being said, I also believe that Star Trek: First Contact is, hands down, much better than the previous TNG movie. After being affiliated with the TNG cast and crew for almost a decade, Jonathan Frakes knows how to direct the cast and provide us with a movie that is thouroughly enjoyable.
This movie introduces us to the Borg Queen, the order behind the chaos. The TNG series never hinted toward a queen, or that, in a sense, there is a leader to the scourge drones of the galaxy. But after watching Alice Krige portray the Borg Queen, you'll want to stand up and beg to be assimilated into her collective.
There is little in Star Trek: First Contact that requires you to be familiar with the TV series, other than knowing that at one time Captain Picard had been assimilated into the Borg as they tried to take over Earth. But the movie does a good job with explaining that to you, along with anything else you need to know.
A good movie with great casting. The string of even numbered Star Trek movies being the best is still intact (true Trekkies will know what that means).",1021593600,,1321,4.418032786885246

Two is a lucky number.  The second TNG film is nothing short of the second fim with the original series cast.  Very cinematic, with a score that's out of this world!  The Borg could very well be the best enemy next to Khan and his Supermen!  Director Jonathan Frakes had the winning formula, put it all together, and the final product flowed nicely.
Star Trek First Contact, as a Trekker.
I can't digest it as a whole.  The Enterprise E, more time travel, and Data getting the most out of the emotion chip are true highlights of the film.  James Cromwell and Afre Woodard are the best 21st century characters I've seen.  But...
How does Picard go from a sensitive man in the TNG episode [I, Borg] to the Terminator, hell bent on revenge?!?  And how is it that through numerous TNG episodes, no queen is mentioned, or even thought of; yet it exists now in First Contact!? And it's recussitating Data?  I dunno, I just dunno.
Star Trek First Contact, the DVD.
Two trailers.  Some behind the scenes footage. Remastered score.  Beautiful visual transition.  All in one DVD.  If it hasn't won my full praise in any other category, First Contact wins it here.

One part of the movie (the assualt against the Borg cube) is one of the best, most famous space battles.

The best parts of any Trek film are when you see the characters stressed to their limits, and the usually cool Picard gets really [angry] in this one.  The extra-vehicular fight with magnetic boots is very slick.
The bad thing about it is that they seem to have little regard for continuity with previous Trek lore.  The story completely contradicts the book Strangers in the Sky, the excellent Giant Book about humanity's first contact with the Vulcans.  The whole idea of the Borg Queen undermines the idea of the soulless unified menace presented by the Borg.  As for Zephram Cochrane, yes, he was mentioned way back in the old series.

Picard has usually been the disciplined, yet kind hearted captain, and my favorite of the various Trek captains, so to see that he can be more than annoyed, to see that he can genuinely hate and hate with such an intense passion as to kill the Borg as ruthlessly as he did was a suprise, not out of character, mind you, just something that is rarely seen. The development of Data was nice as well. Data's child like innocence seemed destroyed in this film by the disturbing Borg Queen, who was played very well.

869818,3,6304415346,"I'm not sure of the ""even sequel"" rule (which stresses even-numbered episodes of Trek films as superior to the odd-numbered), but this flick was more entertaining than I would have expected from a ""Next Generation"" movie (and that's not even counting the horrible ""Star Trek: Generations"").
In this episode (I meant movie!! I mean it!!!), the Enterprise again confronts the Borg - the implacable alien race of cyborgs committed to ""assimilating"" every intelligent race it meets (unlucky races find that their members are turned into drones under the command of a ""collective conscience"" while their technology and everything else about them is appropriated by the Borg). Despite destroying the Borg's ship, Captain Picard quickly realizes that even victory was futile: a Borg shuttle escapes the carnage and journeys back to Earth's pre-Federation past.  Halfway through the time-slipstream, the crew of the Enterprise catches a glimpse of their Earth having already been assimilated.  Realizing that the Borg have somehow changed history, Captain Picard leads the Enterprise through the rift and discovers that the Borg have journeyed to the moment where mankind achieved ""first contact"" with intelligent extra-terrestrial life.  Historically, the moment came when inventor Zephram Cochrane (James  Cromwell) first tested his revolutionary spaceship, one powered by the then unknown warp-drive, and attracted the attention of a passing Vulcan survey vessel.  The Enterprise destroys the Borg ship - but the Borg survive somehow manage to invade the ship and begin assimilating it.  With his crew reduced and his ship barely under his control in Earth's orbit, Picard leads the remnants of his crew against the Borg infestation.  On the ground, an away team meets with Cochrane himself and help him repair his experimental ship - damaged earlier by a Borg attack.
I'm no fan of the ""Next Generation"" but this sequel was a surprise.  Jonathan Frakes's direction is tense and captures the fear the Borg inspire and the claustrophobia of the new Enterprise (this was the debut of Enterprise-E).  On the downside - the film never becomes more than an exceptional episode of a TV show, as opposed to the more cinematic films of ""classic"" trek.  The crew is inexplicably forthcoming with Dr. Cochrane and other denizens of the ""past"" - Kirk and company were a lot funnier trying to hide that they were from the future.  Also, Dr. Cochrane's mountain base is so remote, he might as well be set in the future himself - there's no frame of reference linking him to Trek's past aside from what the script just tells us.  The script also makes a critical mistake with the Borg by giving them a queen.  Though Alice Krige vamps sexily as the queen, it undermines the Borg as being a force of nature blind to the destruction they cause - now they're just a bunch of aliens having a technology that can't be stopped, and led by an evil ruler.  Also, the basic plot left me scratching my head, if the Borg had achieved time travel, would they really need to conquer Earth?  And as logical machines, how would they get past paradoxes of time travel?  All in all, still a superior ""Next Generation"" Effort.",1014076800,5,3189,5.022770398481973

Paramount NEEDS to get its head out of the sand and stop worrying about the bottom line first which is of course profits.
IF and when they decide to put out a quality script as Star Trek 10 looks like it might be only then will the rest will fall into place. The current staff that presides and oversees Star Trek needs a BIG wake up call.
Bring in the GOOD writers and directors and don't depend on those who lead Star Trek on TV because they're tired and out of any fresh ideas.
If you doubt this then merely look at some of the considered scripts for prior films - most had no business even being submitted let alone serious though at being made.",1004054400,,1002,4.306878306878307

869825,4,6304415346,"First Contact is something like Die Hard in space with Jean Luc Picard as John McClain.  Sort of, anyway.  If you're a Star Trek fan, it's even better.
I recently re-watched this movie with a good friend of mine who liked Generations a lot.  I was hoping to convince him that he was missing the boat with First Contact, which is the only really strong movie from the Next Generation series of movies.  I don't think I succeeded, and it's unfortunate, because any movie that can turn me into a Next Generation fan is something special indeed.
Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab/Picard/Action-movie-hero is so unbelievably good that it eclipses just about everything else in the movie.  The last time I saw melodrama this good was from Shatner and Montalban in The Wrath of Khan, and this even rivals that.
This movie was so good in fact that it even inspired a certain fondness for Jonathan Frakes in me--as a director anyway, since as an actor he really only has two expresssions/emotions:  amused and determined.
The only major flaw in the movie was the character of Lily and her interaction with Picard.  There wasn't necessarily anything wrong with their exchanges; it's just that most of the criticism she through Picard's way would have been so much more powerful coming from a character we knew and loved from the series.
If only we could see this kind of drama and excitement and wonder in all the Star Trek movies...",1002844800,,1427,4.753036437246964
869826,5,6304415346,"Although watching a Star Trek film requires shedding reality for a couple of hours, both the novice and the dedicated ""Trekkie"" can enjoy this one.  The newcomer may wonder about technical matters:  how fast is ""warp ten""?; what's a ""temporal vortex""?; why are Federation weapons so ungainly?  Ignore these minor issues for later reflection.  For now, watch this film for the adventure and the people living it.  There's plenty of adventure and some of the people are a treat.
The adventure is a chase through time and space to Earth of this century.  The Borg, a triumph of biotechnology, are trying to disrupt history itself.  A mixture of machine and organisms, they are personified as the epitome of evil.  They aspire to assimilate members of any sentient species into their ""perfect"" collective.  They simply want everybody to be like them: rather like globalization on a galactic scale.  Their leader is rather like a queen bee, a superior among equals .  She's a truly gross character, both physically and morally, the perfect example of the ""modern woman"" as a corporate manager.  Superbly portrayed by Alice Krige, one can only wish the make-up team who turned this beautiful South African into such a monster roast in the eternal flames.  The scene of her blowing on the android Data's emotion chip will remain etched in the viewer's memory forever.
Most of the other Enterprise crew break a little from their traditional TV series roles from time to time.  Picard sheds his lofty role as Captain as he guides the confused Lily Sloane [Alfre Woodard] through a glimpse of her future.  Counselor Deanne Troi, usually so cool and collected, becomes wonderfully sloshed in a Rocky Mountain grog shop.  Worf the Klingon lapses a moment into space sickness.  Jonathan Frakes, as the film's director, has no time for acting, still pompously blustering his way through events just as he does in the TV episodes.
The walkaway portrayal in this film is James Cromwell as Zefran Cochrane.  Since faster-than-light travel is a mainstay of Star Trek tales, it was only logical that some means be devised to show us who perfected it.  Cromwell is outstanding in shattering every image we have of the sombre, knowledge-seeking, ivory tower researcher.  A lecherous old lush, practical as only an inventor can be, he seems more human than any other character in the film.  Confronted by Chief Engineer Jordi La Forge's adulatory account of future honours, he bolts, fearing the wealth he dreamed of coming from his invention will evaporate.  Cromwell evokes the common in all of us - how would we react if this mob appeared in our midst?  Cromwell captures the wonder, resentment, fears and ambitions any of us might if confronted by our future.  Calling his role ""supportive"" is a terrible misnomer - the film is clearly his.
In short, this is a speculative fiction film worthy of your consideration.  There's much pathos, the visual effects don't overwhelm unduly, and the combat, which is a bit obtrusive, is still better than many of the type.  The proximity in time to our own day brings an fillip of novelty from other Star Trek movies.  It's worth watching and keeping, if for nothing else than to generate interest in younger viewers to see how close it comes to the reality of the future.",1001548800,3,3293,4.897111913357401
869924,5,6304415346,"In my opinion, I believe that First Contact has by far been one of the BEST Trek flicks to date, from the beginning as the camera zoomed out of Picard's eye to show the vast Borg cube he was in when he was assimilated, to the end where the Vulcan got spooked by ""Ooby Dooby."" It has a serious tone, but we also get a glimpse at the past, to see what made the Star Trek universe what it is now (in the 24th century that is).
Even though the mood was dark, enhanced by great music conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, and also some from his son Joel, it had its elements of humor as well.
By far, the best scene in the entire movie would have to be where Riker finds Troi totally wasted at the bar: ""Timeline? This is no time to argue about time, we don't have the time! *long pause* What was I saying?"" and after Riker confronted her, she was adamant. ""I'm not drunk! It's a primitive culture...I am just trying to *blend in.*"" Riker's reply and Troi passing out at the table...I fall out of my chair laughing every time I watch it...sometimes I pop in the DVD just to watch that one scene, its that good!
I do have to admit, I did not really like to see Cochrane portrayed as a drunk...but then if he did not do all that drinking, we would have missed Geordi's response to his ""I have got to take a leak."" Another great scene!
All in all, a great flick, and I also love the fact I get to see the trailers for the movie again...they give me goose bumps. Though I found it real funny in the theatrical trailer, they had quick clips from the last TNG episode ""All Good Things..."", ""Best of Both Worlds"", Star Trek: Generations, and there is even a snippet of VOYAGER firing phasers at a Borg cube!!! What was up with that one? *shrug* Oh well.  Its worth the money for any die-hard fan.",1001376000,,1776,4.177842565597667

This is a fun Trek back in time to, oh, about 50 years from now, after World War III but before Warp Drive. The Borg are trying to wipe out The Federation before they even exist (like most Trek time-travel shows, it's best to not think too hard about the science or even the plausibility of the plot, just accept it and you'll enjoy it far more).
The key interactions here are between Picard, who is bent on revenge and redemption owing from the time of his captivity with the Borg, and the Borg Queen. Data also features prominently, and well. There is plenty of Trek humor too.
Add in a decent ending and you've got a great Trek flick. Still only 4 stars because no Trek flick is worth 5 stars. (Although I did give 5 stars to ""All Good Things..."" TNG's 2-episode finale.)

First, the good bits:  This was an exciting adventure movie involving the Borg -- certainly one of the better adversaries ever created in a science-fiction setting.
THIS BEING SAID:
The DEPLORABLE portrayal of Zephram Cochrane, inventor of the warp drive and the equally DEPLORABLE ""first contact"" encounter with the Vulcans flies in the face of everything that REAL Trekkies know and have known about the ""future history"" of the Star Trek world.
Rick Berman and crowd have apparently successfully completely taken over the world envisioned by the late Gene Roddenberry, and the thousands of TRUE Star Trek fans from the 60's, 70's and early 80's.  I, for one, don't like it.
For Canonical Star Trek information about the invention of the warp drive, first contact with the Vulcans, etc. please allow me to refer the reader to the sadly out-of-print ""Star Trek Space Flight Chronology"" and to the early classic Trek novels.
For an adventure movie, yeah, this was worth the minimal time investment.  For a true ""Trek"" fan, however, this was a sad disappointment.",1000857600,2,1106,5.032786885245901

869928,1,6304415346,"I hated this movie.  Hated it.  One reason I really hated this movie is it's inconsistant with the TV series.  In the old TV series we've already been introduced to Zefram Cochrane.  He's not even remotely the same type of person in this movie.  They didn't make this mistake with Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan so why did they mess it up here?
Then, worse, the changed the borg.  The whole point of the borg is that they are relentlessly logical.  They act like a computer.  You can't reason with them.  That's what made them different and therefore interesting from all the other enemies in the Star Trek universe.  Once they introduce the Borg queen and she turns out to have emotions and to be seducable etc she's all of a sudden boring because at that point the borg are no longer the borg but just like any other regular enemy with all the standard faults.  *Warning: Spoiler* Next on my list was the miss direction of the trailer.  In the original trailer for the movie you see Picard saying ""The line stops here!"".  It looks like he's going to kick some major butt.  So then in the movie when he actually never kicks any butt it's big let down.  The whole time I was waiting for him to step up and really take the borg on and instead it all comes down to Data punching a hole in a can with his fist.  That's the big finally.

Or when/where/why did Geordi get Ocular Implants? Or my personal favorite: why did they alter established Trek History with the way they handled First Contact with Zephram Cochran?  Albeit only the true Trek nerds will understand that last one, but it seemed to me as though the story was unfolding before I came in at the beginning and I feel like I missed something important, and left me wanting more.  Now while wanting more is a good thing, it isn't necessarily so good when you feel that the storyline was incomplete, even if by just a little.
With that criticism out of the way, and I apologize it if is too big, but other than that, I very much enjoyed this 2nd outing on the big screen for the Next Generation.  It allowed a lot of humor which had been missing from the previous film, and gave us an exciting story mixed with a great deal of Trek History (even if it was altered a bit to suit Studio heads).  The effects were as usual top notch and while I am STILL waiting for a Trek movie to deal with the greatest nemesis the Next Gen folks ever faced (namely 'Q') I am fervently hoping that Paramount will give the folks a chance to redeem what a fiasco 'Insurrection' ended up being (not unlike how Trek VI more than made up for how horrible Trek V was...).

I have no problems with a slow movie, but this one just seemed to slow without much of plot or character development.

Listen instead to this: It seems that many viewers (and the writers of the Voyager series as well) seem to have missed a rather important fact from the film.  Someone else here mentions that the Borg Queen ""rules"" the Borg, making all of the decisions, and all of the drones are merely slaves to her.  This is actually brought up in the movie, when she first appears, during her conversation with Commander Data.  Several times, she was forced to correct him.. ""you imply disparity where none exists"" and ""I am the collective"".  The queen does not ""rule"" the Borg.  In fact, she's not a ""queen"" in the true sense of the word.  She IS the Borg.  The same way ANY of them are.  She is the new Locutus, a single drone picked out to give a singular voice to the collective mind.  Her death at the end is irrelevant, as she's no different from any other drone.  This also explains her reappearance on the TV series.  She's easily replacable by any other member of her species.
Once I figured this out, I actually found the movie to be even more enjoyable, and adds a great deal of depth to the Borg as an ""entity"".  I hope you'll find the same.",982195200,10,1287,4.379746835443038

870050,1,6304415346,"Before I start please put all phasers on stun because this review's going to be ugly.  I hated ""Star Trek: First Contact"".  It is a pretentious borefest, filled with stupid one-liners, poorly written set pieces, and a perposterous concept.  This film bears no resemblence to the wit, awe, and excitment of any of the previous films or any of the series.
It begins good enough as Picard and the Enterprise battle a Borg cube en route to Earth.  After an all too brief battle the Borg cube is easily destroyed but not before spitting a strange sphere into the Earth's atmosphere.  Picard and crew soon discover the cube has traveled back in time and assimilated the enire planet.  The Enterprise crew travel back in time with the Borg cube to avert this disaster.
From here the film falls apart.  The film tries to be epic in scale but instead concentrates on a clausterphobic environment and dank surroundings.  The story from here centers on the Enterprise crew's attempt to stop the Borg from averting earth's first contact with an alien race.  An important character here is the legendary Zefram Cochrane, the father of warp speed.  Cochrane first appeared in the classic Trek episode as a kind, noble and idealistic man.  Here he carries none of those traits, he's a coward whose only interest in warp speed is not the benefit of mankind but cash.  Where did this characteristic come from?
Another problem is the crew's total disregard of the ""Prime Directive"" of non-interference.  In previous episodes and films the stories always had fun with this concept as the crew contemplated how not to interfere too much with the natural flow of time.  Here they throw that concept out the window as Riker and a drunk Troi tell Cochrane that they're time/space travellers and that Cochrane's about to make the first warp jump.  They arrogantly assume that Cochrane needs their help.  Why?  Didn't Cochrane perform the experiment alone during the natural flow of time?  Why would he need their help now?  Because it's ""cool"" and the Star Trek characters need something to do.
Other low points involve an achingly slow paced action sequence involving Picard and Worf during a space walk to the main deflector dish to stop the Borg from contacting another Borg collective.  This scene is not dependent on story or suspense or even action but instead shock value and stupid one-liners.  ""Assimilate this!""????
Another disasterous scene is aboard the Enterprise as Picard is harrassed by a 21st century woman who is conveniently trapped aboard the ship as Picard's love interest.  The woman is angry that Picard has decided not to destroy the ship but stay and fight to the death with the Borg.  This scene could have been very good if it were between Picard and any one of the Enterprise characters.  Instead it feels forced and unrealistic.  Why would Picard listen to her?  Why are we supposed to care what she thinks?
The premise of time travel in Star Trek has always been interesting but this time, it doesnt' look or feel like time travel.  It just looks like the Enterprise crew are stuck in the woods.  There is no era that the crew travel to for the audience to relate to.  No old west, no depression era, no NASA launch and no 1980's humpback whales.
The film tries to be an entertaining blend of action, horror, romance, and comedy.  It does none of those qualities well.  I tried to enjoy ""First Contact"", I really did.  The film has some great visual effects and soaring music by Jerry Goldsmith, but none of the great characteristics of what makes good Star Trek, only contrived scenes and 90's one liners.  This is the weakest Star Trek film ever, and a bad movie in it's own right.",971481600,9,3689,4.75
870051,3,6304415346,"So, the all too chummy, too politically correct Star Trek: The Next Generation crew finally hit the mark in the motion picture game with this screen adaption of the popular television show.  Here we see Captain Picard finally taking off the kid-gloves instead of taking the pansy and unbelievable every-alien-will-negotiate stand he usually took during the tv series' regular run.  It was also good to see that Picard has his own prejudices(like Kirk vs. the Klingons) and vulnerabilities as the rest of us in our all too non-perfect universe.
The story was somewhat implausible when you consider that the Borg seemed to be going through too much trouble to change the history of a planet that in the universal scheme of things is a infinitesimal part of the galaxy. However, this fact gets lost in the nostalgic storytelling by the Star Trek creators as humans again prove that we are the center of the universe.
As a whole, however, the movie is still great entertainment whether you are a Trekkie or not.  It has enough great special effects and entertaining dialogue to keep your interest throughout the movie and we finally got to see who became our first alien ally at the end of the movie.

The Federation is under  attack by Star Trek's most dredded villians 'The Borg'. Upon arrival near  Earth, the crew of the Enterprise engage in a battle against the Borg ship.  The Borg, near defeat, play a final gambit at victory.  The Borg Queen  sends a small Borg ship back in time to the Earth's past.  Picard and crew  go in pursuit of the ship back to the Earth's 22nd century.  A 2nd battle  ensues, and the Enterprise destroys the Borg vessel, but not before the  Borg Queen has done some damage on Earth and not before she beams herself  on one of the decks of the Enterprise E.  Quickly like a virus, she starts  assimilating the crew.  The dilemia is two-fold.  First, stop the Borg  Queen from assimilating the entire crew.  Second, try to fix the damage  that has been done to the timeline by getting Zephram Cochrane to continue  with his warp speed spaceflights. Who gets assimilated?

Interesting Trivia and sceens to watch for:
During  the holodeck scene, as a 1940s-era big band plays in the background,  director/costar Jonathan Frakes can be seen playing the trombone. During  the holodeck scene, Captain Picard and Lily are greeted by a hologram  played by Ethan Phillips who also plays Neelix on Star Trek: Voyager. The  deflector dish is labeled AE35, the name of a component of a satellite dish  in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The eyepieces of the Borg flash the Morse  code of the names of people associated with the production.
Some Greate  Quotes From The Film:
The Borg Queen: Brave words. I've heard them  before, from thousands of species across thousands of worlds, since long  before you were created. But, now they are all Borg.
Dr. Beverly Crusher:  So much for the Enterprise-E.
Picard: We barely knew her.

This includes the directing, the story, the drama, the laughter, frendship, loyalty, survival, freedom, human nature, cold heartedness, eveything! This movie is a way to see all  of humanity. Evil versus good.  The choice is simple. Live as an individual  or live without being able to decide your own destiny. This is what humans  have done throughout their existance. Invadors (Borg) and freedom fighters  (Enterprise crew)  If you remember one thing from the entire movie let it  be the conversation between Data and the Borg Queen. One of the highlights  of that is:  Data ""Beliving oneself to be perfect is often a sign of a  delusional mind"" and Borg Queen ""Small words from a small being  trying to destroy what he doesn't understand""  I'll let you be the  judges of those words.

Patrick Stewart is always a command presence as  Capt. Picard(Kirk may be the best Captain,but Stewart is the best actor to  sit in the chair),and his quest for vengence agaist the Borg is captivating  as well as terrifying. And the rest of his crew(with the exception of Brent  Spiner's Data)is not overlooked as they were in Generations. A great battle  scene with the borg(which includes DS9's Defiant)is followed by scenes  alternating between 2063 earth and a war zone with the Borg on the  Enterprise-E.Sometimes the audience feels like they're watching two  different movies,and the last scene with the Borg Queen seems like an all  too convienient TV ending.

870169,1,6304415346,"I'd like to say I loved this movie, but I can't. It should have been great, but as with most things Star Trek of late, the writers just seem to drop the ball. First Contact should have been a terrific film, but for some  reason the powers that be at Paramount seem to think time travel makes for  good story telling, when it instead simply displays the writer's lack of  ability to tell a story. However, I must give credit where credit is due,  Jonathan Frakes is an excellent director and does a good job in pacing,  scene layout and delivery to make an otherwise forgettable film  watchable.
 First Contact deals with the arrival of the Borg, a  supremely denuded race of cyborgs bent on assimilating everything and  everyone in the galaxy, sort of like a large corporation. Unfortunately  from their treatment within the series (Next Generation and Voyager), they  are no longer the threat they once were. Not only is the Federation  technologically capable of withstanding the Borg, incidence within the  series have proven that there are numerous ways to defeat this supposedly  untakable species. However, that is not say that Starfleet has been sitting  on their laurels either. The introduction of the Intrepid, Defiant, and  finally the Sovereign class of starships proves that the Federation can now  stand up to the Borg, as all three ships were engineered specifically to  combat them. The Defiant is unabashedly called a `Borg Killer' while the  Sovereign (the Enterprise E), is a `Super Battleship'.
 So, as the  Enterprise is scouting out comets along the Neutral Zone, the Federation  takes it to the Borg when they arrive at earth. But they just don't seem to  have the fire power until the Sovereign-class Enterprise arrives or so one  would think. Picard, through his contact with the Borg knows where their  weak spot is and they concentrate their fire power in one location and blow  the cube to bits. It is at this point that I was given to wonder just why  the heck Picard has never mentioned this before and placed it in the logs  so that the entire fleet had access to this design flaw in Borg ship  design. Just as the cube explodes, a smaller ship launches out of it and  speeds towards Earth with the Enterprise in hot pursuit.
 Then, god  help me, the Borg sphere jumps back in time. Goes back in time to shoot  down the Phoenix, Zephrym Cochrane's warp ship that gets noticed by the  Vulcans who established relations with us Earth trash and ushers in a  golden age for all of mankind. But at the same time the Borg also infest  the Enterprise and begin to take it over...undetected...like a  sophisticated starship like the Enterprise doesn't have an alarm system or  sensors that detect unauthorized beaming into one's ship. They try to cover  this by stating that long range sensors are down, well, inside one's ship  is decidedly short range! While Picard and Data battle Borg on the ship,  Riker and LaForge battle a childish Cochrane in a series of cliche future  vs. the past exchange culminating in a pee joke. As the planet side crew of  the Enterprise fawn over Cochrane, he becomes increasingly irritated  because he isn't building the warp ship to usher in a new age, but instead  because he wants money and naked women, well at least he did it for the  right reasons.
 In 9 Star Trek movies there have been 2 that dealt  with time travel! For crying out loud, if it was that easy then everyone  and their dog would be doing it. Doesn't anyone out there understand that  time travel is not only over used, but weak story telling? Just because  James Cameron did it well twice is hardly an excuse shoddy writing. Anyway,  Picard is faced with the fact that he may have to blow up his brand new  ship, and it takes stirring speech from Lily to convince him not to. Except  that Picard's response is right on the money and the Borg should be wiped  out of existence. Meanwhile Data is having problems of his own having been  captured by, you guessed it, the Borg Queen. Anyone NOT see this coming?  She's an individual amongst the drones complete with freewill and user  friendly parts. She attempts to seducing Data by offering him real human  flesh so that he would be one step closer to humanity. Anyone getting tired  of Star Trek movies that are only about Captain Picard and Lt. Cmdr  Data?
 Face it, the Star Trek franchise is in the toilet. Everything  from movies to novels to the series still on TV, stink. It won't take  chances, it doesn't push the envelope like the old series did, and is  touchy-feeling and above all else, politically correct with its smarmy  holier-than-thou humanist views. It stopped being science fiction a long  time ago, because they no longer ask the question `What if...'. They don't  explore anymore, there aren't anymore strange new worlds, and sadly, all  they're doing now is timidly going where we have all been before. Star Trek  needs to get back to its roots, take some chances, expand our sensibilities  while it expands our consciousness. It hasn't done that for a long time and  I miss it.",963619200,12,5080,4.679138321995465

Now that I'm off my soap box, I must say that this is  the best Star Trek movie made to date. Sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat movie  watching experience.
The Borg are back and now they're out to destroy  Earth.  Former assimilated Borg himself, Jean-Luc Picard is off to the  rescue in this extremely entertaining sci-fi adventure.

The Borg seem to me to be the most  terrifying villain any Star Trek crew has ever encountered--for they  threaten more than one's life--they threaten to destroy one's identity.
Part of what makes this film work is what made several of the previous  Star Trek films, and much of the Classic series, work so well:  The  abandonement of technobabble and the placement of visual effects squarely  at the service of the story.  Also, the characters are more  three-dimensional here--Patrick Stewarts's performance merits particular  praise.  For nearly the first time in the Next Generation run, the Captain  is not just a guy in the center seat giving orders, but a leader.
By  sending the Enterprise-E back in time to the mid-21st Century, the audience  is able to witness ""future history"" in the making.  But herein  lies one of this films few problems: My one caveat with this film is the  lack of respect shown by the producers for consistency in Star Trek lore.  An example: Zefram Cochrane was played in the Classic ceries by Glenn  Corbett, who died in 1993.  James Cromwell, a fine actor in his own right,  does not resemble in the slightest Mr. Corbett.  Why couldn't Mr. Frakes  and Mr. Berman find someone who at least bore a passing resemblance to the  original actor?  The simple question is that they did not care about  consistency, nor do they have any respect for the Classic series, or its'  fans.
For all that, the scenes leading to man's historic first warp  flight are riveting, and the final scene of first contact with the alien  ship was very moving--although absolutely no one in the audience was  surprised when the aliens race was revealed.
This is one of my  demonstration DVDs.  The transfer and sound are excellent, although one  could have wished for more extras from Paramount.",958521600,2,2049,4.843478260869565

If Spielberg is too busy to helm another 'Indiana Jones', then I  respectfully suggest Mr Frakes. He does a fine job on 'First Contact' with  a story that pays homage to Trek folklore. The cliches are all there; time  travel, a threat to Earth and the existence of the Federation. But Frakes  dances with the cliches instead of stepping on their toes. We have an  exciting voyage that finally makes use of the big-screen potential of The  Borg. There are only a couple of flaws to the story and the production  itself. How does someone living in a virtual shanty-town build a starship  in his back yard and why do the space battle scenes only last 55 seconds?  Movies are supposed to give you what you CAN'T get from television. So why  does the average TV episode of 'Deep Space Nine' have far more space battle  action than a two hour big-budget film? Quibbles for sure, but worth noting  anyway. This movie is well worth the money and effort but with the quality  of the TV shows so relatively high it makes you wonder how much longer they can keep the movie franchise going. And yay! Rock and Roll music  finally gets some respect in Star Trek. To hear them tell it, you'd think  that classical and jazz were the only forms of music left in their century! And  finally; have you ever noticed how many Star Trek films are based on, or  have major scenes on the planet Earth? ALL OF THEM EXCEPT 'Insurrection'.

Special effects are a  tad patchy, but at their best rival anything short of 'The Matrix', with  CGI finally pulling Trek into blockbuster realm. Acting is solid, and is  raised to extraordinary heights during one scene between Picard and Lily in  the Captain's Ready Room, which is simply superlative drama. It may be the  best scripted- and acted- scene in Trek.
So the humour falls a little  flat at times, and the normal Trek mantra of thoughtfulness and  caring-sharing gets pushed to the rear. So what?

Another  benefit is that the core cast know each other and their characters so well,  that the performances simply ooze out of them.  Patrick Stewart, always the  diplomat, always level headed, gives us his best performance to date as  Captain Picard.  He ignites the film right from the off, and never lets the  flame die out.

But the movie makes a major  point here that I think only one previous reviewer touched upon.
Without  Zefram Cochrane's warp flight,the whole Star Trek universe falls apart. In  the future, history later (quite justifiably) rewards him for this. And yet  this was a womanizing alcoholic who was ""just in it for the  money"". Now THAT's realism.",947980800,3,741,4.872

I really can't say enough positive things about this film.  Seeing  the Borg in a theatrical film is a real treat, and writers Moore and Bragga  demonstrated that they were capable of writing a real movie script this  time around.  In addition (as a previous reviewer has already noted), they  were actually able to create a real character out of Zephram  Cochrane-instead of a meticulous, technobabble quoting, 1 dimensional  character (as has been the case before with ""Star Trek"" so often)  the audience actually gets to see a wild and crazy drunk who dances to Roy  Orbinson tunes.
In addition, the ever restrained Picard looses his cool  big time after being forced to dwell upon his experience with the Borg in  ""The Best of Both Worlds"" episodes from the TV series (which I  highly recommend seeing)-the result is an ugly and well-acted  confrontation with Worf.  Be cautioned however-this film is not meant for  younger children and well deserves its PG-13 rating.  The Borg, as they  have been redesigned, could give any kid nightmares for life.
Other  positive comments: composer Jerry Goldsmith turns in what is indisputably  the best score of any ""Star Trek"" film to date-I strongly  recommend buying the soundtrack to this film as well.  The special effects,  as done by Lucasfilm, were extraordinary (enjoy them-Paramount couldn't get  Lucasfilm for ""Insurrection"" and may never again), especially  during the spacewalk battle on the hull of the Enterprise.  My only  complaint: at the height of the film's climax, the audience really isn't on  the edge of its seat,as they were in, say, ""Star Trek 2"" for  example. The scene is still exciting nonetheless. All in all, ""First  Contact"" was one of the best ""Trek""s ever and one of the  best science-fiction films ever made.",947894400,5,2053,5.0148809523809526
870469,5,6304415346,"The best of the series.  At least as good as Wrath of Khan.  This flick begins solidly mired in the tension of a Federation under siege by the Borg Collective: the one enemy the crew has never really beaten.
The film is  incredibly well done.  The story, set in the post-Atomic 22nd century,  alternates between two conflicts: the possibility that the Borg may have  altered history and thwarted the original beginnings of the Federation; and  the fact that the Borg are aboard the Enterprise taken it and the crew one  by one.  The tension as Picard, Data and Worf march to confront the Borg is  heartstopping.  It's kill or be assimmilated.  Data's capture by the Borg  Queen is fascinating as we all want to understand the origins and  organization of the Collective.  The original score is fantastic, a walk on  the outside of the ship is really cool, and Capt. Picard's futile  grudge-match with the Queen add incredible verve to this film.
With  these newly souped-up Borg, ever so much scary than the tv incarnations,  you're bound to agree with Lily, ""Jean-Luc, blow up the damned  ship!""",947808000,,1096,4.759358288770054

Brent Spiner as Data is effective as always.  The Borg Queen is amazing  at her seduction of Data.  The story is thick with many details and keeps  you guessing at every turn.
The direction by Frakes is much cleaner  than the next in the series.  There are less ""soap opera-ish""  lines and scenes in this one.

It kept me interested until the end, and it was mysteriously creepy for a Star Trek film - Picard and crew walking amongst the Borg was nail biting stuff.  However, the ground plot  was boring, but necessary.  Perhaps it was the characters on the ground.  The Borg's costumes aren't as good as they are in ST:Voyager.
All in all,  I can recommend this movie to any science fiction fan, and also to anyone  that likes a bit of suspense.",945129600,,475,4.517647058823529

The only disappointment is the battle sequence with the Borg cube---it could have been longer.  This film shows Patrick Stewart at his  prime.  No question about it, the man and his crew know how to act.  And  sorry Loser Shatner fan, but old wrinkled Bill boy should've gone after  Trek 6 and allowed Stewart to do Trek 7 alone.  If I were to rate this  1-100 so I could get as detailed as possible Id give it a 91.  It was great  but not perfect.

And my  ""non-trek"" friends had no problem following the story. Patrick  Stewart gave an amazing performance as Capt. Picard as did Alfre Woodard.  The producers of the STAR TREK series have out-done themselves with this  one.",926035200,,503,4.735632183908046
870899,1,6304415346,"I admit I can't understand what so many TREK fans see in this film.  It doesn't feel like STAR TREK at all--more like the typical forgettable action-adventure flick.  Great special effects, but as with Jurassic Park,  they don't make a good movie in and of themselves (d&eacute;j&agrave; vu!).  It efinately  doesn't stand up to repeated viewings like its immediate predecessor  Generations.  I do like the continuity with the original series episode  ""Metamorphosis"" in the character of Zephram Cochran, but other  than that this movie seems to me to be an attempt to make a box-office  blockbuster (i.e., use of the Borg once again, lots of action scenes, dark  lighting, etc.) instead of a STAR TREK feature.  Little substance, lots of  standard action-movie clich&eacute;s and tricks. I also don't think the way the  Borg were portrayed in the story fits in too well with the way they were  portrayed during the TV series.  The story's not as flawed as some of the  other ST flicks (The Final Frontier and Insurrection), but it still  retreads over old, well-worn ground with the time-travel device (used over  and over again throughout STAR TREK), the saving-Earth and/or the galaxy  syndrome (Star Treks I, IV, and VI), the shallow villain syndrome  (especially Star Treks III, V, and IX [Insurrection]), etc.  Everything  about the film, including the new ship, conveys a dark, menacing impression  despite the fact that at this point the war with the Dominion had yet to  begin.  As with nearly all standard action flix, after seeing this two or  three times it becomes almost painful to watch all the way through.",924480000,8,1622,4.977528089887641

Of course, if you're even thinking about buying it, you've PROBABLY seen it in the theaters...so I'll say this: the  movie holds up nicely in repeat watching on DVD. Sure, it's got more action  than most, but it also has time travel, which seems to help make for good  movies. Personally, I still think Wrath of Khan (#2) is the best of the  bunch, but depending on your taste, I'd place First Contact as either the  2nd best or 3rd best. Frankly, this movie may be worth watching just to see  the Borg Queen - from entrance to exit, that is an amazing character.",920937600,,668,4.304

Their job is to repare the damage that  the Borgs have inflicted in a newly made spaceship that will take the human  race into a new era. In  VHS First Contact was a fantastic two hour  experience. But in DVD it reaches perfection. The quality of the image is  incredible but what is really great is the powerfull 5.1 Dolby Digital used  at its max.
