8185697,4,B0002W4UU2,"This is the best DVD from the Laffapalooza! series.  Sheryl Underwood is great.  Get ready because she breaks it down and comes with the funk with opinions about Republicans, Terrorists, The war in Afghanistan and all kinds of other stuff.  Mad TV's Aries Spears' performance is very funny.  Just check out his impersonations.  He'll have you cracking up.  I promise.  Kenny Howell is funny as well.  You'll like his ""Call Out A Dance,"" routine.  Just buy this DVD from the series and you won't regret it.  Don't bother with the 1st, 2nd or 4th installments of this collection.",1120003200,2,577,4.795918367346939
