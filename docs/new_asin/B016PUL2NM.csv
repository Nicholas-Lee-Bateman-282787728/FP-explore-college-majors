8737089,4,B016PUL2NM,"My five year old has really enjoyed this DVD. It has lots of episodes. It holds her attention well. She really likes that when it spells out the words, the letters look like the word. For example, when spelling out the word egg, the letters look like ceacked egg shells; when spelling out the word cow, the letters have legs and are white with black spots (there's even a tail and cow poop which brings on the giggles!). Twiki and Twini speak limitedly. There are two narrators, a woman with a British accent and a young boy. They lead you through the episodes and spelling each word. My daughter is just beginning to spell and learn to write so this is perfect for her.

We received a free copy of this DVD in exchange for our honest review of it.",1456444800,,748,4.3428571428571425
