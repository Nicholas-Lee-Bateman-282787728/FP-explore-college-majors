4857956,4,B005Q382OW,"I have to agree with John Malanga's assessment (see other reviews).  This is yet another variation on the ""How to Marry A Millionaire"" theme (going back as far as Zoe Akins' ""The Greeks Had A Word for Them"") that Fox used over and over.  It's strictly ""State Fair"" cornball until the girls get to Atlantic City; then the sets and costumes improve and there are some delightful numbers.  Vera-Ellen gets lots of play as she is the dancer in the bunch.  Given Hermes Pan's fine work with Betty Grable in various Fox musicals (let alone his RKO contributions), I have to say that the choreography of Seymour Felix is quite dull, and an elaborate ballet based on ""You Make Me Feel So Young"" is overproduced and unfocused.  The plot machinations get quite strained in the final third when Celeste Holm finally makes an appearance, and she brings a very contemporary quality to the movie that it had successfully avoided till then.  Interestingly, and oddly, the film's producer-lyricist Mack Gordon and composer Joseph Myrow give Holm a variation on ""I'm Just A Girl Who Cain't Say No"" from ""Oklahoma!,"" which she had been performing to much acclaim on Broadway.  This one's called ""Always A Lady,"" and it's a trick on how she's really not.  Holm's looks are very well handled by the Fox team and there are times when she looks quite beautiful.

Now, as for the print.  The film starts well.  It looks like a copy, or a copy of a copy, but no real beefs until they get to Atlantic City and things get a lot darker.  There are times when it seems like a color noir thriller!  It's just amazing that this is the only print that Fox has.  Still, I agree with John that the purchase is not a total bust as the movie -- if you like Fox musicals -- is a sweet and simple delight, and a definite plus for the collector.  I'd prefer a better print, especially for the price, but I'm happy to have it in my ""vaults.""",1378512000,9,1902,4.472463768115942
4857957,4,B005Q382OW,"Three Little Girls In Blue (1946) is a Technicolor remake of Betty Grable's
big musical hit, Moon Over Miami (1941). This time around, three sisters
from Red Bank, N.J. head to Atlantic City to find a wealthy husband.
June Haver stars with George Montgomery. Singer, Vivian Blane and
dancer, Vera-Ellen co-star as her sisters.

There are some beautiful songs including Somewhere In The Night,
the wonderful, You Make Me Feel So Young and the catchy,
On The Boardwalk In Atlantic City. Celeste Holm sings Always A Lady,
fresh from her glowing reviews in Broadway's Oklahoma.

I watched this dvd last night on a blu-ray player and I have to
say I was disappointed in the picture quality. There is a problem
with the contrast so that the bright areas are too light and some
of the dark scenes are too dark. Having said that, it's not all bad.
The color is pretty good, the sound is fine and overall, I'd say
it's acceptable. Some of  the close-ups of the three stars are beautiful.
Had I been able to watch this dvd before buying it, I would still
buy it because there is much to enjoy.

The people at Fox Cinema Archives should be ashamed of themselves.
They obviously don't give a damn about remastering and are willing
to release anything to make money. Don't they know that better
quality prints would increase sales? I guess we will just have to
settle for whatever they give us, but it's a damn shame when we all
know how beautiful these films are supposed to look.

4857960,1,B005Q382OW,"If you^ve got another recording of this, keep it. GIVE THIS ONE A MISS The picture quality is appalling it^s so dark you can hardly make out the characters. It gets darker and darker as the film progresses. I^m suprised at Fox Archive releasing it in this condition. If you don^t have a television recording for example, then this is better than nothing, But beware, you have been warned Great film ruined by the picture quality",1405555200,2,428,4.644736842105263
4857961,3,B005Q382OW,"As several other reviewers have mentioned, this is once again a recycling of previous Fox musical plot, most notably ""Moon Over Miami"".

I think the thing 21st century audiences need to bear in mind is that this film (and the others) were made prior to television and (of course) home video. There's very little chance of the audiences of the 1940s being able to remember seeing this plot, even though it was used only a few years previously. Further more, during the war years, it was considerably less expensive to dust off and recycle plots, sets, costumes, props and background music (you'll hear songs from ""Tin Pan Alley"" in this one) than to spend money on all new production.

I don't know if this film was previously on VHS tape or not. I recall checking it out of my local library on a VHS tape several years ago but, when I went to borrow it again, it was no longer there. I mention this because I have a rule about purchasing any of the Fox Cinema Archive series DVDs. Because there are no extras of any sort, if I own it on VHS, I'm not buying the DVD - unless my tape gets damaged or unless my VCR dies. I was never able to find this one on VHS so I broke down and bought the DVD.

Three notes about the production:
1. The characters travel from Atlantic City (in the summer) to an estate in Maryland. Somehow, in the course of only a few hundred miles, they manage to go from summer to a season where there's no leaves on the trees in Maryland.
2. The actor who plays Myra's beau doesn't even rate a screen credit. He has a whole song about him but somehow his name was left on the cutting room floor.
3. This is the film film that introduces the song ""You Make Me Feel So Young"", which was a standard Frank Sinatra song.",1404345600,,1736,4.270516717325228
4857962,2,B005Q382OW,"How many times did 20th Century Fox use this theme? It has been over worked to death. But this version is very poorly directed and acted, especially that of the non-talented Vera-Ellen, who has one of the worst musical numbers ever put on film. The only saving factor is Celeste Holm doing her Ado Annie interpretation. And Fox Archive strikes again. This DVD has such faded and dark colors that the word Technicolor can't even apply. Why does Warner Archive put out such great DVD prints and Fox Cinema Archive put out such lousy prints?",1399680000,,538,4.673684210526316
4857963,4,B005Q382OW,"Most people are all summarizing the same way.  Unfortunately the movie got a bad treatment in its release, but the music and story are very good.  I'm not usually a big fan of George Montgomery but he is pretty good here as the leading man.  I imagine most of the singing was dubbed for some of the stars but a young Vera Ellen, June Haver, and Vivian Blaine make a great set of entertainment packed sisters.  Blaine's ""Somewhere in the Night"" along with Vera Ellen's dance to ""You make me feel so young"" are among the highlights along with another sharp comic turn from Celeste Holm.  Worth a watch but don't put much into the print.",1398038400,,634,4.431034482758621
4857964,3,B005Q382OW,"Loved the movie, loved the songs, loved the memories that it brought back from seeing this movie over and over again with my mother, and I would have given it five starts except for the fact that, being hearing impaired, I didn't get any of the dialog. When these old films are released on DVD, they should realize that teen agers are not the demographic that are interested. It's older people, people who were alive in 1946 and saw it for the first time. We need closed captions and this film did not have it. Luckily, I could hear the music a bit and remembered all the lyrics so I could sing along, but it would have been great to hear the dialog too.",1385683200,,654,4.282258064516129

4857967,5,B005Q382OW,"Just the way I remembered this great movie. It used to be on AMC and Fox movie channel but never on VHS grr. I was able to get a VHS copy of a recording off said channel years ago and it was satisfactory, although grainy and so so sound. These little movies deserve the DVD and Blu-ray treatment, after all, these movies started it all. So happy the major studios are allowing on-demand production of these  amazing movies and Amazon  is the best place to get them, you'll trust that it is the original movie, from the original studio on a great dvd. Packaging and performance of dvd is incredible. Thanks again Amazon and 20th century Fox for opening your catalogue of great movies",1382832000,3,682,4.491935483870968

4857969,4,B005Q382OW,"Thoroughly enchanting FOX musical about three girls (June Haver, Vera-Ellen, Vivian Blaine) who head for Atlantic City in search of millionaires. FOX used this plot for at least 5 films.  The Gordon-Myrow score is quite lovely with at least one hit song YOU MAKE ME FEEL SO YOUNG. An additional number THIS IS ALWAYS by Harry Warren sung by Haver and Montgomery was cut from the film for its theatrical release. However, it is heard as background music. I have been waiting for the DVD of the film for sometime. FOX has been quite spotty about the quality of their classic MOD releases and the print definitely disappoints.  Sometimes it seems washed out and other times dark and muddy. I have to say the audio is fine though. I do think its useless to complain since FOX apparently could care less about the quality of these releases.  No trailer as usual. I love Vera-Ellen and its odd to see the way she looked (slightly plump) before she was pressed into anorexia by becoming rail thin by the early 1950s. For anyone who loves the FOX musicals of the 40s I highly recommend this one. Now bring on CENTENNIAL SUMMER which contains Jerome Kern's final musical score.",1378944000,7,1168,4.660194174757281
