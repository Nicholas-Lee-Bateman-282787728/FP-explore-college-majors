7854578,4,6303816681,"This video is a 30-minutes workout led by the classic, Joanie Greggains. Her humor is cheesy, her direction is scatterbrained, and her choreography is downright boring. Which is why you have to love this video! It's more like having your friend in your living room working out with you!

The workout starts with a brief warm-up and then alternates aerobics, with aerobics with light (1-3lbs) hand weights in 3-5 minutes segments. Then she cools you down. The end of the tape has a host of helpful hints for those new to working out.

The reason this tape appeals to me is that it's filled with a Christmas background and has ""dance"" mixes of songs of the season. The premise is that you do this workout between Thanksgiving and Christmas, in addition to what you would normally do, and you won't gain any holiday weight. Works for me! I will be keeping this video.

7854579,4,6303816681,"This is a 30 minute workout led by Joanie Greggains, who is best known for her ""Morning Stretch"" TV show.  The workout takes place on a set which looks like a living room including a fully decorated Christmas Tree with presents around it and a fireplace.

There are several sequences, each done to a different holiday song.  You will alternate simple aerobic routines, with upper body exercises using light weights with simple aerobic moves.

First you will warm up to Winter Wonderland, the warmup is basic, step taps and lunging side to side with assorted arm movements, there is no stretch though.

The first section is titled Basic Moves Intensity 1, the song is Sleigh Ride.  It is all simple aerobics, step touches and hamstring curls along with simple arm movements.

The second section is weight work performed to Jingle Bells.  Light weights are used, 1-3 or maybe 5lbs for more advanced are recommended, of course the routine could be done without weights.  Bicep curls, traditional and alternating, tricep extensions, chest presses, shoulder crosses, pec squeezes and upright rows are some of the exercises you will see.  These are all done with step touches, you don't stand in place at all.  Kind of resembles the ""4 limb aerobics"" often seen in the Firm videos.

The next section is called Combination Moves Intensity 2, more aerobics with Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  You will see more step touches and marches with claps.  This section uses much more space as Joanie will have you moving from one side of the room to the other and also going diagonal.  Again simple aerobics moves with assorted arm movements.

Another weight segment follows, this time to Joy to The World.  More simple aerobics with upper body exercises, step touches, marching, walking side to side (which Joanie calls ""The Downtown Walk"").  You will also see more bicep curls, tricep extensions, pec squeezes, lat pulls, upright rows, shoulder crosses and alternating shoulder presses.

The next segment is Combination Moves Intensity 3 performed to White Christmas.  The aerobic section is mainly high impact, but Joanie says to keep it low if you prefer.  You will see jogging, scissors (Joanie calls this Cross Country Skiing), twists, kicks, a hip twisting move Joanie calls Turkey Hips, all done with assorted arm movements.

The final weight sequence follows, 12 Days of Christmas is the song choice.  More step touches with bicep curls, traditional and alternating, upright rows, shoulder shrugs, tricep extensions, chest presses and lat pulls.

You will go into the Transitional Phase, which are simple aerobics to bring the heartrate down.  Silver Bells is the song playing here, very simple segment, more step touches and simple arms.  Finally you will cooldown to We Wish You A Merry Christmas where Joanie leads you through a stretch.

This workout would be best for beginner/intermediate levels, I would recommend watching it once before doing it as there really isn't much cuing at all, you just do the moves as they happen.  The choreography is very simple and easy to follow.  Joanie has a fun personality and looks like she is having a good time.  She has her funny comments and will even sing along once in a while.  This would be a good workout to do on Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Morning when you are not up to anything strenuous but still want some physical activity.  Or anytime during the busy holiday season.",1126396800,7,3425,4.954385964912281
