2055371,5,B0002234HW,"This is an EXCELLENT DVD for bloopers fans.  The commentary/host is wonderful, and the bloopers themselves will have you laughing until your sides hurt.  There are no stupid or silly bloopers here--just good, old-fashioned mess-ups caught on camera!  This DVD deserves an A+!",1089936000,24,275,5.348837209302325
2055372,4,B0002234HW,"From Time Life video, this video is an excellent collection of news bloopers from around the world. The tape includes a collection of clips taken from live broadcasts and videotaped reports. The out-takes are grouped by subjects with amusing sound effects added in the background. In addition, many of the segments are introduced using actual television equipment. This really helps you understand the technical aspects of broadcast journalism and the equipment used in the studio.
The tape includes out-takes from stations around the country, the BBC in England, and other news outlets.
One downside is that I have seen some of this tape's 50-minutes worth of bloopers on other blooper shows (including the ones hosted by Dick Clark on NBC).
If you enjoy seeing people mess up and at their worst, I would recommend this video.",973036800,10,827,5.088235294117647

8020306,5,B0002234HW,I like watching blooper shows. They're funny and fun to watch. I'm glad they've decided to make this show and have it for sale.,1396828800,,127,4.333333333333333
8020307,4,B0002234HW,This wasn't too bad.  Had some pretty funny clips in it.  It did contain some repeated clips in it as well as a few that didn't make sense.  On a whole though it wasn't too bad.,1355097600,,177,3.861111111111111

8020309,3,B0002234HW,"Nothing I'd want to see more than once, but worth the current price of about
$2. It's better than some of the other bloopers DVDs in that it doesn't give you
long, unfunny introductions. A word or two, and then the clips - that's a plus.",1308182400,2,237,4.173913043478261
8020310,5,B0002234HW,"We have literally watched this probably a half dozen times and still laugh at it. Funnier than movie/TV bloopers, these are mishaps that often went out on the air over live newscasts. I have the VHS version, and if this is the one with the ostriches checking out a newsman, that one alone is worth the price. We loved the segment where the cameras went crazy and did things they weren't supposed to.",1243296000,,399,4.47945205479452
8020311,3,B0002234HW,"The bloopers are a mix of some really hilarious goofs, some pretty amusing goofs, and some boring ones.  The majority are either hilarious or amusing...making the DVD pretty entertaining for the price.  The 'camera position' bloopers are the best...they had everyone watching rolling on the floor with laughter.  I like the News Bloopers better than movie bloopers...just because 'hometown' newscasters are closer to 'regular people' than big movie actors.",1200182400,3,456,5.579710144927536
8020312,5,B0002234HW,"Unratable for the following reasons but probably deserves 5 stars:

This is hardly a review since I haven't been able to watch these two DVD's. The reason is that Amazon USA never indicates if you're buying DVD's which are playable in Europe (Region 2). This should be clearly stated in the info accompanying the disks on the Amazon website. I guess I am forced to return the Blooper DVD's but in my mind it's an unnecessary hazzle. By the way, I bought a couple of other disks and they worked fine. Please correct this and save the international (Icelandic) buyer a lot of money and time.
