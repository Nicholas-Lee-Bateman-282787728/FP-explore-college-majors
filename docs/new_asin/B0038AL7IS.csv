Suffice that, on the other side i do overstand why some writers are spewing thier usual brand of racism and hate at yet another Afrikan who has chosen to cease and desist the butt kissing attitude of Nelson Mandela?

Be reminded of how all which has transpired came about  Perhaps it is time for a taste of Afrikas story!  From year 300 A.D Overpopulation and ecological changes in the Sahara region of Africa, results in immigration of Bantu tribes to more southern areas. The Bantu people, settling in what we today know as Mozambique,brings the region into the iron age. The new people also starts agriculture.

AFRICAN KINGDOMS
Around year 1000 Bantu speaking clans grows into larger groups which again develops to kingdoms and empires all over East Africa. The Bantu's also starts connections with Arab, Persian and Asian traders settling at the coast. Objects from India/Asia are traded for African gold, ivory, shells and skins.
1200-1400: Mozambique does not exist as a unified country, but as numerous kingdoms. The region is divided with natural boundaries by the two great rivers: Zambezi and Limpopo. The area north of Zambezi river is dominated by the kingdoms of Makua, Yao, Maravi and others. These groups are again organised in several more or less integrated sub-groups. The Shona Empire rules between the two rivers and this area later again becomes known as the kingdom of Zimbabwe. Most of the impressive stone buildings known as Great Zimbabwe are situated in today's State of Zimbabwe. South of Limpopo several Thonga kingdoms develops during the 1400's.

1400's: The Zimbabwe kingdom are followed by the Monomatapa empire. The Monomatapa empire posses rich goldmines, which are later, by Europeans, believed to be the legendary mines of King Salomon.

All along the coastline of East Africa, the Arab traders have settled and Islam is having a huge impact. The new mixed Islamic-African culture is known as Swahili.

 ENTER THE RACIST COLONIZER whose plan is to TAKE, MURDER, RAPE AND DENY a PEOPLE?

VASCO DA GAMA
1498: Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reaches the shores of Mozambique with four ships. They are well received in Maputo and then sails on to the town of Mozambique. He is surprised to find a developed society with trade, monetary economy, wealthy merchants and sheikhs. There are also sailors who possessed the knowledge he was looking for: the sea-route to India. The Portuguese needs to do a little ""shopping"", but they don't have much to trade with and tensions grows between the Swahili people and their European guests. The town are plundered and bombed as Vasco da Gama sails of (He surely isn't much of a diplomat and makes more enemies than friends on this first visit in East Africa). From Malindi in Kenya he finally continues towards India.

1500: Vasco da Gama returns to Mozambique with more ships and weapons. His intention is to take over control of the region. The Portuguese fleet arrives and within a few years the Portuguese is in charge of all trade. To achieve this they destroy most of the Islamic-African civilisation in military campaigns. All towns and city states not willing to surrender to Portuguese terms, are attacked. The Portuguese three-point trade is in function (India-Africa-Europe).

The Europeans justifies the violence and killings as a Christian crusade against Islamic influence. Vasco da Gama himself ordered destruction of a ship carrying 380 Muslim pilgrims (unarmed men, women and children). Stories of these hostile acts reached far into the Arab world with no good promises for the future.

PORTUGUESE SETTLEMENTS
1600's: After staying at the coast, the Portuguese now tries to reach further into the continent. Explorations starts from the Zambezi river. As more land are ""discovered"" Portuguese farmers are encouraged to settle in the country. The Portuguese can now grab whatever land he wants and make his own private kingdom and army, as long as he pays the ""Prazo"" tax to the Portuguese crown. The farmer paying Prazo (the ""prazeros"") also gains the rights to use the people in his territory for labour. This way an effective way for Portugal to expand it's influence in the area, but it also made Portugal dependent on the Prazeros

NEED I SAY MORE? HOW DARE U ..ANY OF U REGARDLESS OF HUE DENY MY PEOPLE ARE RIGHTS TO OUR RESOURCES DIGNITY AND SELF DETERMINATION? HOW DARE YOU WITH YOUR ARROGANCE COME INTO MY CONTINEBT AND ROB RAPE ENSLAVE AND MURDER AND THING THAT ""KARMA WOULD NOT FOLLOW?  lmao As for Mugabe i hope he continues until his death via natural causes of US CIA murder which will more than likely happen.  MOVING RIGHT ALONG!

This way an effective way for Portugal to expand it's influence in the area, but it also made Portugal dependent on the Prazeros.

1698: After loosing Mombasa and the Kenyan coast to the Arabs, Portugal concentrates on their possessions further south.

1700's: As one of the few places in Africa it becomes common for the Portuguese landlords to adapt some degree of the African culture. Many settlers weds local, African women. The settlers become more ""Africanised"" and they refuse paying taxes to Portugal. Arab and Indian traders on the coast regains some of their power as control from Portugal are weakened.

Maize and cassava are being introduced by the Portuguese in most of Africa.

COLONY AND SLAVERY
1752: Portugal announces that Mozambique is now their colony. The slave trade starts.

1787: The Portuguese raise a fort in Loureno Marques and a town starts to develop around it.

1800's: Slaves has become a major part of trade since the late 1700's. Most slaves from Mozambique are sent to French sugar plantations in Reunion and Mauritius as well as the Portuguese plantations in Brazil. The Portuguese slave trade blooms when Great Britain bans it. Approximately 1 million slaves are shipped from Mozambique during the 1800's. Conflicts between different African groups breaks out as some tribes are hunted while other groups functions as slave traders.

Mid 1800's: The Monomatapa empire finally collapses under the continuing pressure from both Portugal and the new generation of Arab traders. Nguni people from South Africa takes over the Thonga kingdoms (south of Zambezi) and forms the Gaza empire.

1869: Portugal officially abolishes slavery, but the cruel trade with humans goes on in Mozambique until around 1900.

1878: Portugal can only control the Southern part of the country and chooses to lease out large territories in the North to trading companies, many of which is British. Britain and Germany had threatened to take over control of the colony, and this is the only solution for Portugal to hold on to their power.

Slavery is on return, but forced labour, known as ""Chibalo"", are used by these companies on plantations and for construction of roads and later railways.

1884-85: The European countries splits up Africa at the Berlin conference. Portugal claims all the land between Mozambique on the east coast and Angola on the west coast. But the country is not among the strongest European countries and has to settle with less. The ""scramble for Africa"" has begun.

Portuguese East Africa are dominated by those Bantu kingdoms who had gained from the slave trade. Other groups has been more or less wiped out. A few Portuguese traders, officials and military are still in some of the coastal cities, but without much power and almost without contact to Portugal.

1886: A railway is being build to connect Transvaal with the city Loureno Marques. Gold has been found in the Boer-republic of Transvaal (South Africa)

1891: Portugal and Britain signs a treaty which lays out the current borders of Mozambique.

The Gaza empire in the south were among the Africans to gain from the slave trade. The empire now has considerable political power and does it's best to resist all kinds of Portuguese influence in the area. The resistance is carried out with both acts of violence, trade and diplomacy. Other kingdoms are also fighting the colonisers, but the different tribes and people never manages put away their internal disputes and join forces.

1895: Gungunhanas, the last emperor of the Gaza empire is captured by the Portuguese and deported to the Azores.

WORST LIVING CONDITIONS IN AFRICA
1907: Portugal moves the colonial capital of Mozambique from Ilha de Moambique (the Mozambique Island) to Loureno Marques. The new capital has a population of approx. 5,000. Most political and economic activities in Mozambique are also transferred to the south.

1915: After the fall of the Gaza empire Portugal finally has military and political control of all Portuguese East Africa. For the first time all kingdoms and territories of Mozambique are under the same rule.

Three big trading companies are managing half of Portuguese East Africa. The companies owns all rights to agriculture and mining in their area. They can also claim taxes from the local population, who are forced to work on the plantations. Approx. 100.000 Mozambicans are forced to work in the gold mines of Transvaal (South Africa). Life conditions in the colony are so bad, that many Africans choose to cross the borders to the neighbouring British colonies.

FASCIST REGIME

ASCIST REGIME
1926: A fascist coup turns Portugal into a military dictatorship. Ant&oacute;nio Oliveira Salazar comes to power, and this means an even more tight grip on the African population and more widely use of forced labour.

The new Portuguese government has close ties with the white governments in neighbouring countries Rhodesia and South Africa. Roads and railways are built to give the neighbours access to the big ports in Mozambique. Due to poor administration by Portugal, most profit are made by Rhodesia and S.A. Portugal completely neglects to develop Mozambique or make any kinds of social progress for the inhabitants. Schools and hospitals are only for the Portuguese citizens.

1932: Portugal takes over a more direct control of the colony, and decides to cancel all agreements with the foreign trading companies. The fascists wants to get all possible profits directly to the Portuguese so-called ""new state"".

The Salazar government encourages primarily poor Portuguese people to immigrate to the Mozambican colony. The population grows rapidly in Mozambique, but most of the new inhabitants are only bringing even more social problems to the area.

The Portuguese government rules the colony through a racist system similar to the South African apartheid. Schools are still only for the Portuguese population. It is forbidden by law for Africans to make any kind of business and the majority are forced to hard and dangerous labour on farms, in mines and in cotton production.

The catholic church expresses a commitment to educate the Africans. But only on their own conditions which includes obligatory Christianity and support to the fascist regime. Mozambicans can only avoid being used as forced labour by becoming ""assimilados"" -meaning that they willingly give up their own culture and indigenous beliefs. These assimilados are (at least in theory) allowed to get basic education. Among the requirements are that the Africans has to wear shoes, eat with fork and knife and prove that they are not sleeping on the floor! Only very few chooses this humiliating solution to solve their misery.

GROWING RESISTANCE
1959-1960: Groups of African farmers in the province of Capo Delgado forms co-operatives to run their own business. The leaders are imprisoned within short time.

June 16, 1960: Government gunfire kills more than 500 participants in a peaceful demonstration in Mueda (Capo Delgado). ""The Mueda Massacre"" only inspires more to strive for independence.

In the early sixties most African nations are gaining their independence. But both South Africa and Rhodesia are run by a white minority. Portugal does not intend to give up power in Mozambique and Angola, which are still the least developed of the African colonies. Mozambican resistance movements are formed in the neighbouring countries of Malawi, Tanzania and Rhodesia. Opposition also starts to form among students in Lisbon and Paris.

1961: Forced labour (Chibalo) is at last abolished in Mozambique. This is probably done by the government to show a sign of ""good will"".

1962: After independence of Tanzania, the Mozambican resistance are centralised from Dar Es Salaam with support of president Julius Nyerere. The newly formed organisation gets the name FRELIMO (the Front for Liberation of Mozambique). President of Frelimo is Eduardo Mondlane, but internal struggles for power in the organisation continues in the following years. It is agreed upon that freedom for Mozambique can not be gained through peaceful methods.

FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM
September 25, 1964: The first shot is fired in the freedom fight against the Portuguese regime which still shows no sign of retreating from Mozambique. A military post in the Cabo Delgado province are attacked. Within short time Capo Delgado and Niassa are under Frelimo control. That is guerilla forces with support from the local farmers.

1966: Most provinces in the northern Mozambique are now liberated from Portuguese control.

1969: Eduardo Mondlane is killed by a bomb in Dar Es Salaam. The assassinators are from PIDE, the secret police of the Portuguese fascist rule. Samora Moses Machel follows Mondlane as president of Frelimo.

Portugal is sending more soldiers to Mozambique to hit back on the resistance. The government also gets support and weapons from NATO. Both the Portuguese colonies and apartheid South Africa are considered to be ""friends of the West"" during the cold war.

END OF FASCISTS - END OF WAR
April 1974: Portugal and its fascist regime is weakened from the colonial wars in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea Bissau. This finally leads to a military coup. The changes in Portugal helps Frelimo to gain power in Mozambique and it becomes legal for Africans to form political parties. Frelimo convinces the new Portuguese military government that it is ready to take over control of Mozambique.

September 7, 1974: Samora Machel of Frelimo agrees on a cease-fire with the Portuguese minister of foreign affairs. The agreement also includes independence of Mozambique with a Frelimo based transitional government.

June 25, 1975: Mozambique becomes independent. Samora Machel is the first president in a Frelimo single-party system. The capital changes its name from Lourenco Marques to Maputo.

Inspired by the situation in Rhodesia, some Portuguese settlers try a coup d'etat against Frelimo. The coup fails when put down by united forces from Frelimo and Portugal.

Portugal pulls out of the country within short time, leaving Mozambique in chaos. Frelimo fails to convince the white settlers that the new republic has room for everyone. Within short time most of the white settlers has left Mozambique and what they see as a terrorist government. On their retreat many settelers choose to destroy as much as they can (houses, livestock, cars, infrastructure and machinery) to prevent others from using it. In many ways the Portuguese settlers leaves a gap behind, which can not easily be filled by a population without education and a government without experience. To some extend Frelimo tries to prove that it is not anti-European or racist by offering remaining white people posts in the government and administration.

BIG CHANGES IN SHORT TIME
Frelimo and the new Mozambique has hard work ahead. The government immediately starts to form a new society with very radical changes: Local committees are formed all over the country to restart industry and farming and to solve other kind of practical problems. All farmland and houses are expropriated. High priority are given to education. Private schools and hospitals are made public. Banks and companies are nationalised. All development are dictated from the top of Frelimo in fast pace. Probably too fast.

March 1976: Mozambique closes its borders to Rhodesia and starts support of ZANU (Zimbabwean African National Union). ZANU is fighting Ian Smith and his white minority regime in Rhodesia.

1977: The socialist wing of Frelimo gains more power. The party is now Marxist-Leninist and makes new plans after Soviet model. Many of the new doctrines are in conflict with traditional African beliefs and society. F. ex. Frelimo is working for women's liberation, against the system of bridal price and does not approve of polygamy. Members of Frelimo are not allowed to belong to a church and the many traditional healers are not accepted. These sudden changes to a very traditionally bound society came as a shock to many and gave Frelimo new enemies.

Mozambique receives economic support to the state farming from the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and the Nordic Countries. Politically, the country is supported mainly by the Soviet block and therefore considered as a threat by Rhodesia, South Africa, USA and the NATO alliance. The governments of Rhodesia and South Africa tries by all means to destabilise Mozambique.

FORMATION OF RENAMO
The South African resistance movement, the African National Congress (ANC), is permitted to work in the southern Mozambique bordering S.A. To the west, Frelimo permits the Rhodesian resistance organisation ZANU to operate from bases within Mozambique. The answer from Rhodesia is the formation of MNR also known as ""Renamo"" (the National Resistance movement of Mozambique). Renamo is controlled by Rhodesian intelligence to fight back against ZANU inside Mozambique.

Renamo is anti-socialist and anti-Frelimo, but that is about all there is to the political programme of the new organsitaion.

Among the Renamo soldiers were several of the white people who had fled Mozambique after the independence, who saw a chance for return. More exile Mozambicans were recruited from Portugal and South Africa. Other soldiers are recruited in rural areas tempted by promises of a better life or by force. Many leaders of Renamo are has a past in Frelimo, but were kicked out of because of theft, disagreements or other crimes against the new society. Others again joins Renamo, frustrated by the hopeless situation in their country and Frelimo's incomprehensible socialist ideas. Frelimo provoked many people with their dramatic changes to society and now has many enemies. Traditional healers are also among the people joing Renamo, which cleverly takes advantage of the traditional beliefs and the common fear of witchcraft.

1979: The Renamo army now consists of 2,000 men.

1980: Many years of fighting in Rhodesia finally leads to the fall of the white regime. Robert Mugabe becomes president of the new republic of Zimbabwe. All Zimbabwean support to Renamo is stopped. The army, weapons and leadership of Renamo is transferred to South Africa shortly before the independence of Zimbabwe.

CIVIL WAR
1981: With South African support, Renamo grows to more than 7,000 men and triples within the decade. For the South African apartheid government, this is a chance to destabilise the feared ""black communists"" in the neighbouring countries. South Africa cuts down on the use of Mozambican mine workers and finds alternatives to the big Mozambican ports.

More and more brutal attacks are carried out in Mozambique by Renamo. Targets are everything from farms, infrastructure and industry to schools and hospitals. Some attacks are carried out by soldiers from the South African army. Every effort is made to destroy the fragile Mozambican economy. Within short time soldiers from both sides are plundering villages, killing, raping and kidnapping children and young men for their armies. There are no heroes and no civilians are spared.

1983: The Frelimo government are hit very hard by the continuing attacks and sabotage. On top of this, frequent droughts and floods in Mozambique results in widespread famine. The economy is diving and Mozambique turns to the West for financial aid for the first time. Frelimo's socialist reform programme has failed.

March 16, 1984: Governments of South Africa and Mozambique signs the ""Nkomati Accord"". The treaty is a promise not to support hostile acts against each others governments. Mozambique keeps their promise and closes the ANC bases, but South Africa unofficially continues their support of Renamo. The resistance army also receives financial support from right-wing movements in USA, West Germany and Portugal. Renamo moves its headquarters to Malawi.

September 1984: Frelimo changes their political strategies and applies to be accepted by IMF and the World Bank. The socialist doctrines are modified to please the new Western donors.

South African minister of foreign affairs, Pik Botha, failes an effort to mediate between Frelimo and Renamo.

October 19th, 1986: President Samora Machel dies under mysterious circumstances in a plane crash. The plane crashes into a hillside in Transvaal (S.A.) when flying from Lusaka (Zambia) to Maputo. The plane were navigating after a false signal. The signal could have been transmitted from South African military to divert the plane. More details on the crash and the investigations here: [...]

The more pragmatic Joaquim Chissano is elected by Frelimo as new president.

1987: Malawi is finally convinced to stop its support of Renamo. It is a coalition of Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola and Botswana putting Malawi under pressure. Approx. 10,000 Zimbabwean soldiers are fighting in the civil war on the Frelimo side.

Most people in Mozambique never realises if they are terrorised by Frelimo or Renamo. Both parts in the war are carrying out cruel attacks on civilians. People in rural Mozambique simply wants peace and a chance to go on with their lives.

NEW PRAGMATIC TUNES
1988: Some voices within Frelimo finally realises that the modernisation efforts and ""cultural revolution"" have been to drastic. The society could not function without the ancient traditions, which are now beginning to be accepted again.

September 1988: President Joaquim Chissano meets with Sout African president, P.W. Botha.

July 1989: The Marxist-Leninist doctrine of Frelimo is officially cancelled at the party's congress. Renamo still doesn't have an official political ideology except a wish for the introduction of market-economy. It becomes more and more apparent that it is not a war of ideologies. It is also clear that neither Frelimo nor Renamo can get a final military victory to end the absurd civil war.

July 1990: Protestant and catholic churches invites the parties to the first of numerous peace negotiations.

November 1990: Mozambique adopts to a new constitution allowing a multiparty system. The country changes name from the socialist inspired ""Peoples Republic of Mozambique"" to simply ""Republic of Mozambique"". State companies are once again being privatised. Freedom of speech and freedom to form political parties are now part of the Mozambican constitution.

October 4th, 1992: A new round of peace negotiations in Rome finally results in a cease-fire and peace treaty. The end of the cold war has changed the international political climate, and thereby making way for peace in Mozambique. The political changes following in South Africa also influenced. Frederik de Klerk, the new president in South Africa finally stopped the last support for Renamo, and the following ANC government surely had no warm feelings for Renamo. In Malawi, the Renamo-friendly dictator Hastings Banda were on retreat.

October 15th, 1992: The cease-fire is officially in effect. As a part of the treaty, Frelimo has to acknowledge the existence of Renamo as a political party in Mozambique. A huge effort is made to change Renamo from a guerrilla army to a responsible party of politicians.

United nations are given the main responsibility to continue the peace process. The UNOMOZ peace force moves into Mozambique to carry out the plans. Among the tasks are arranging elections and ensuring the peaceful return of refugees. Both parties are exhausted by the long war and sincerely wants peace in the country. A new united army of Mozambique are formed with a force of only 10,000 men.

Life slowly returns to abandoned towns all over the country. Friends, neighbours and family members were forced to fight on different sides in the war. Now they face the challenge of reconciliation and building a future together. So does the different ethnic groups in the country.

ELECTIONS
October 1994: First free elections in Mozambique are held. 6.3 million registered voters can choose between candidates from 14 political parties, the two largest being Frelimo and Renamo. Almost all parties in the new democracy are promoting a new liberal economy, and they promise to work for better social conditions. International observers ensures that the elections were fair.

Frelimo wins elections with 44 percent of the votes against Renamo's 38. Joaquim Chissano remains in office with many personal votes, but it came as a shock for Frelimo that they did not have the total support from the population. It was also a surprise that so many people were voting on the Renamo-party which had basically been terrorising them for so many years. A huge part of the population never found out what the war was all about, and who was responsible for what. Another guess is that the return of the traditional leaders to the villages influenced the results in favour of Renamo.

RECONCILIATION
Mistrust between the rivalling parties continues -and at times there is even a fear that the peace in Mozambique is very fragile. It seems the reconciliation process has been most successful in the local communities using traditional rituals. What seems to be ""strange"" religious rites are some times ancient social precautions for retaining a well functioning society. Home coming soldiers had to be ""cleaned"" from the evil spirits, which according to traditional beliefs, had caused all the misery. The healers in African villages are functioning as the local ""psychologists"" and social workers. A successful cleansing process includes a lot of talking and debate, and has a double effect: The soldier felt forgiveness and relief from his dark conscience and traumatic memories. His surroundings accepted him, as he was forgiven by the ancestors and higher powers, thereby allowing everybody to start over again.
 This in my opinion just as in South AFRIKA WAS THE DOWNFALL AGAIN OF MOZAMBIQUE  WHY? EUROPEANS LIEDTO THE NATIVES AND THEN STABBED THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK. The mission was to take take take while being FORGIVEN?  not! WHY SHOULD THE PEOPLE RECONCILE WITH LIARS THIEVES MURDERERS AND TAKERS?

1995: Mozambique becomes a member of the Commonwealth countries, traditionally a union of countries which has been British colonies.

December 1999: Joaquim Chissano (Frelimo) once again beats his Renamo rival Afonso Dhaklama in presidential elections. International observers approves the election.

February 2000: Southern Mozambique is suffering from floods. Thousands of people are forced to leave their homes.

November 2000: A Renamo protest against the 1999 elections ends in chaos and riots with at least 40 people killed in Montepuez. A few weeks later, 83 people who were arrested at the demonstration, dies in the prison. The prisoners suffocates as they are all being held in a single 21 square meter cell.

November 22, 2000: The journalist Carlos Cardoso is shot down on a street in Maputo by men armed with Kalashnikovs. 49-year old Cardoso was well known for his critique of corrupt politicians and police. Almost nothing is done by police and judges to find the perpetrators. Following the murder, several other critical journalists receives threats on their lives.

4084075,4,B0038AL7IS,"While this documentary of a white farmer fighting for his land against the bullying dictator Mugabe
and his `land redistribution' program that mostly redistributed land only to his cronies is certainly
a stirring, fascinating battle, there is also something a little simplistic in it's attitudes. Almost
something a little colonial.

No one can defend Mugabe and his treatment of his own country, but the film acts as if there's
no reason for lingering resentment of white, upper-class property holders after centuries of white
domination. Even the lead character talks to and about his black workers in a sort of condescending
`see how well I treat them?' sort of way.

I don't pretend to be any sort of expert on the situation in Zimbabwe (there are some fascinating
back and forth arguments in some of the reviews here, and - in more detail - under 'comments'.)
I just know I can't help feeling things are not so simplistic when the white ex-South African owner
of a huge farm talks about the blacks he works with as if they were children or less than his
equal.

Again, I am in no way defending Mugabe. I know enough to see that he is clearly a
ruthless, horrendous dictator, who has done great harm to blacks and white alike. I'm
saying there is another, more subtle issue in this particular story that gets short shrift, making
it feel a bit more like a polemic, and a bit less like an objective view than I wished. I don't
know enough about Zimbabwe, but neither does most of the world. Just a few minutes of
history to deal with the context both the country's history and the farmer's, might have made
me either trust the films' arguments more deeply, or question them more thoroughly. Now I was left
with a vague feeling of 'is this the whole story?'

To quote Roger Ebert's generally positive review; "" ""Mugabe and the White African""
could certainly have looked more deeply. The filmmakers travel to Kent in England to speak with
the family of Campbell's son-in-law, but never have any meaningful conversations with the African
workers on Campbell's farm.""

Or The New York Times: ""It should be pointed out, though, that Ms. Bailey and Mr. Thompson
achieve their results largely through the narrowness of their focus. Almost the only voices we
hear are those of the farmers, their families and their lawyers. Other viewpoints are limited to
a rant by the man, a government minister's son, to whom the farm has been promised, and
Mr. Mugabe's recorded voice, including his notorious line that he doesn't mind being seen as
a Hitler by the West.""

""It's possible to honor the suffering of the Campbells and the Freeths and to revile the actions of
the Mugabe government and, at the same time, to be uneasy with the emotions the film stirs and
to feel that its one-sidedness and its nearly complete lack of historical and cultural context are problems.
The farm's black work force is frequently on screen and is presented as sympathetic to its employers, but
the workers rarely speak. It's impossible to know what their true, probably complex and contradictory feelings are.""

""Mr. Freeth asks why being a white African should be any different than being a white American or a white
Australian. It's a good sound bite, but a moment's reflection tells you that the comparison doesn't hold water:
the courses of colonialism and racial strife were radically different in America and Australia than they were in Africa.
That doesn't make Mr. Freeth's cause any less just, but it does mean that ""Mugabe and the White African"" needs to be
approached with care.""

A worthwhile documentary, that gets very tense at times as clandestine footage captures the threats
the farmer and his family live under, and their struggle through the courts. But it misses, or perhaps
intentionally ignores the bigger picture that explores how things got to where they are in the first place.
It's very hard to make any documentary that is explicitly about modern African black on white racism,
without looking at the context and the larger history. Not to forgive or absolve it. But to understand it.
And surely understanding where an evil comes from is a crucial part of any examination of it.",1315440000,7,4177,4.807799442896936
4084076,5,B0038AL7IS,"I agree with the others, this is a great documentary of a man who started out as a liberator and has turned into one of the most despotic, racist and power hungry dictator's in the past 30 years. His criminality and blood thirsty bigotry has devastated what  was once  not only Africa's breadbasket, but also a major tourist destination. For what purpose-to maintain himself in power. He has abused, killed and menanced his countrymen. While this documentary focuses on the story of a particular white farmer, it also illustrates the heroic courage of many black Zimbabweans who risked their lives in support of the higher ideal of brotherhood and democracy. Hell will be too cool for Mugabe when he get there to rest alongside Stalin, Hitler, Lenin and other bloodthirsty degenerate dictators.",1313452800,7,794,5.007575757575758
4084077,5,B0038AL7IS,"As people in developing countries have escaped colonialism, the colonizers have been pushed to the margins of history or caricatured as one-dimensional villains. The documentary Mugabe and the White African suggests that - at the very least - things are more complicated. The film is well worth watching and provides a lot of food for thought.

Viewers learn of the plight of white, Zimbabwean farmers Mike Campbell and his son-in-law Ben Freeth. They own a huge farm, but face eviction by the government of Zimbabwe's dictator, Robert Mugabe, so that their land can be given to black Africans. The fact that Mugabe's government had earlier given Campbell title to the land means nothing.

The film focuses on two series of events. The first is an international court case that Campbell and Freeth have launched in Namibia in an attempt to save their land. The second is a series of attempts to take over the farm by high officials from Mugabe's government. Both threads are interesting, but the attempted farm takeovers are more dramatic. Mugabe inadvertently stars in the film as the man who bringing down a country to preserve his power.

Some critics have noted that Mugabe and the White African tells just one side of the story - that of white farmers being forced off their land. This is true. The film does not question the equity of Campbell's ownership of a huge farm in a country where many have nothing.

I thoroughly enjoyed Mugabe and the White African. While it is not the entire story of post-colonialism in Zimbabwe, it is thought provoking. (Viewers who are interested in the subjects of white settlers in the post-colonial world might also enjoy the books Last Days in Cloud Cuckooland by Graham Boynton and Lost White Tribes by Riccardo Orizio).",1309305600,4,1764,4.889632107023411
4084078,4,B0038AL7IS,"The documentary follows a family of white farmers who, having legally purchased and utilized their farmland for over 20 years, are under threat of expropriation by the Mugabe regime. The documentary follows the family's optimistic and idealistic legal challenge to Mugabe which, inevitably, fails. Considering the state of the judiciary in Zimbabwe this is no surprise. Eventually the family is beaten and nearly killed and does lose its farm. It loses it under the guise of land ""redistribution"" which, in reality, is anything but. The so called ""redistribution"" consists, in reality, not of taking land from white farmers and giving it to the ""poor"" or ""landless"" but to Mugabe's cronies and the ""connected"" who then go about stripping the farms, running them into the ground and making them totally unproductive. Hence not only do the white farmers lose their land but the black farm hands also lose their jobs and Zimbabwe, a predominately agragrian based economy, loses tax income and agricultural production. As a result of these seizures Zimbabwe has gone from being a large agricultural exporter to a large net importer of agricultural products. No mind, however, as Mugabe's friends , family and supporters end up lining their pockets as a result.

One of the remarkable aspects of the film is its footage of Mugabe's cronies that clearly show their explicit racial policies of ethnic cleansing of the european segment of the population. During one espcially illustrative clip, the son of one of Mugabe's ministers, an individual whose hand's the family's farmland falls into, goes on a tirade blaming the european races for ""theft"" and ""running the economy into the ground"" and then goes on to call, quite literally and explicitely, for the expulsion of all those of european decent from Zimababwe. ""They have no right being here"" the spoiled brat of a minister's son states with quite some pride and glee.

If this were happening to black farmers the world would be in rage. There would be calls of racism and demands for action from every corner. Instead, there is barely a word from anyone in the international community. Where is Jesse Jackson (or any of his followers) one begs to ask? It is this double standard that the film makes apparent, rather ironically, without even making much of an effor to do so. It is this element that really give it its bite.",1307491200,9,2372,4.987373737373737

4084081,1,B0038AL7IS,"The opening scene is emblematic for this piece of propaganda. You're hurtling along at great speed, too fast to look left or right, throwing up clouds of dust.

It doesn't get much clearer after that. You will only be given the opinion of a few old colonial types, and their lawyers. No one else has the opportunity or right to speak. All the real information has to be gleaned by your own research, from slipped remarks.

For instance, there is a scene with Ben Freeth standing in front of his 'employees', and tells them, ""I will bring you blankets."" Now clearly, his employees were wearing overalls and were not naked, so he wasn't exactly 'clothing the naked'. However, don't they earn enough money to buy their own blankets? Ben Freeth gives his employees what he calls ""a square deal"", which apparently doesn't include blanket money. Without that 'square deal', they would be 'starving to death', he keeps insisting.

In order to believe these conceits, you have to believe that 1) African's don't know how to farm and 2) all the land went to friends and cronies of Mugabe. Neither of which are true. Africans have been farming for thousands of years, and over 200,000 families (over 1,000,000 people if you count their dependents) have received land. The registered tobacco farmers at the TIMB went from 1,500 to over 80,000 active farmers, and over 100,000 total registered tobacco farmers, because of the Fast Track land reform program. Google: 2014 Annual Statistical Report. Check under Growers.

Someone mentioned that this video was made 'at great risk'. I'm sorry, but we're talking about the same country that received tens of thousands of tourists every year, one of which is Bill Gates, who goes there with his family for Christmas. Google: bill gates holiday zimbabwe safari

The farmer in this documentary bought his land after Mugabe took power and thus claims he has a legitimate claim to his land.  This is equivalent to someone buying loot plundered from the Nazis and claiming that he legitimately purchased it and thus he legally owns it.

Buying stolen property doesn't make it yours.  It merely makes you an accomplice in a crime.  Zimbabwe was stolen from native Africans and they deserve compensation.",1294012800,8,668,4.954954954954955

In the end, they garnered sympathy, got beat up, lost their farm, and affected Mugabe's power base not at all.  Good job.

I always believed you either do something or you don't.  First of all, I have a hard time understanding how Mugabe eluded assassination at some point.  Unlike, say, Joe Stalin, Mugabe seems to have presented himself to the public.  Didn't anyone who had their family tortured / killed have the courage to trade their life for Mugabe's?

The farmer in the film obviously had financial resources.  Certainly there should have been former South African SAS or Rhodesian SAS who, for a price ( or quite possibly simply room and board ), would have come and helped defend the farm.  A dozen or so strategically placed should have at least made the local hooligan trash think twice.

Once called the breadbasket of Africa due to the numerous successful farms, Mugabe's land redistribution policies have decimated farming and made Zimbabwe an importer of food rather than an exporter.  For the most part, Mugabe and his allies have targeted white farmers and instituted government policies to officially confiscate their farms and property.  This documentary follows the struggle of one white family to keep their farm.  The family brings their case to an international African court which rules in their favor.  Unfortunately, in the end Mugabe's thugs takes their farm and burns it.  Sadly, the end results of these policies are unemployed black farm workers, food scarcity, higher food prices, a damaged economy, violence, and racism.  Racism can come in many colors and forms.
