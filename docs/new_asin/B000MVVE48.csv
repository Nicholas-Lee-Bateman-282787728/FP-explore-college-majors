2750554,5,B000MVVE48,"I have a huge collection of guitar books and dvds and was not really sure I needed another one when I bought this DVD.  Many other books and dvds discuss the CAGED system and I already knew what it was all about.  However, I was very surprised by how much I learned from this DVD. I really think this guy must be an outstanding teacher.

Serna is very clear and concise in his instruction.  His statements are short and to the point.  He not only walks through the CAGED chord forms, but follows them up with a natural introduction to arpeggios, chord fragments, and inversions.  I have never seen an easier review of these often confusing concepts. He provides suggested practice tips are fast, simple and very clever. As I watched him go through his practice routines, I knew I would be doing them for a lifetime.

Another great feature is that he relates his teachings to familiar songs by popular artists.  This really gives the viewer a great way to apply what they have learned.  No corny background music or unfamiliar musical examples.  I found myself pulling out old tab books to test what I had learned.

The pace of the DVD is also great.  Serna keeps the material coming; not too fast, not too slow. I hate the long boring pauses that exist in many instruction guides.  Little touches like an easy to use DVD menu are nice as well.  I am always surprised how other guitar lesson DVDs skimp on this important convenience.

I also noticed that the video and camera work were of great quality.  The camera provides clear views of finger placement.  Many DVDs show the guitarists hands at a poor angle or with such poor lighting that it is impossible to really tell exactly what they are doing.  In this video, it was very easy to see exacty what was being played.

After watching this DVD I was so impressed I ordered his other DVDS and they all rate five stars as well in my book. (The DVD on modes is the best I have ever seen).  In a sea of poor quality instruction, this is an outstanding series that will save the intermediate player years of learning the hard way.  Highly recommended.",1194652800,33,2100,4.488126649076517
2750555,5,B000MVVE48,"Hi Friends !

Just wanted to give my honest opinions regarding this DVD. Kindly refer to my review of Desi's Pentatonic DVD for other details - Actually I wrote that review for both the CAGED and PENTATONIC DVD...

Regarding Customer support -

ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS of Desi's Instructional products (IMHO) is the Wonderful Customer Service. Desi is so kind and takes real personal care of his Customers. Being in India, my Pentatonic DVD was delivered to me damaged (due to the Bad Indian Postal System) 3 times and Desi kept resending the DVD to me untill it was delivered safe and in great condition ! I don't think many people would do that these days.

I guess there would have been a error / misunderstanding in the previous case, where a customer has complained regarding the defect in the 2nd DVD. I really don't know but I guess the issue would have already been solved, as I see that the Author himself has commented in the Review. May be the person has forgot to update the review...

Anyways, I would surely recommend this DVD which teaches one of the most important topics THE CAGED SYSTEM and as I've always said regarding Desi's products - you wiill surely not be disappointed ! This is yet another great Instruction material from a wonderful teacher !

Thanks for reading my opinions - I hope it helps people to choose the right things...

Regards

2750557,4,B000MVVE48,"This isn't revolutionary but it may open your eyes to the patterns that are all over the guitar neck, at first chords but ultimately everything. If you truly absorb this information you WILL be a better player.",1428364800,2,210,4.702702702702703
2750558,5,B000MVVE48,"This DVD is full of useful information for any guitarist that's ready to move beyond playing everything in a single position. The CAGED system is straight-forward and easy to pick up, and this DVD spends a fairly large amount of time on each element, as well as linking the various elements together.

The guitar is an instrument of equivalencies; there's usually at least one or two additional ways that you can do exactly what you're already doing, and a plethora of ways to vary each of those but still retain the same overall structure. The CAGED system is geared towards allowing you to easily see the entire neck's ""interconnectedness"", and honestly succeeds in this task. I've been playing guitar now for the better part of three decades, and I was amazed at how things that were right in front of my face that whole time suddenly became obvious (almost unavoidable) after I adapted this way of ""seeing"" the neck.

This DVD is not for beginners. You should be fairly comfortable playing many sorts of chords, and have at least a basic understanding of how to find single notes on each string. Knowing the basics of the diatonic major scale would also be a huge help as well. If you're beyond that and know some more advanced theory this whole thing will come together fast and furious for you!

Recommended!

EDIT: I wanted to add something here. There are a lot of arguments going on all over the Internet concerning whether or not the CAGED system is really useful, especially for playing metal leads. I'll be the first person to point out that this system has some serious limitations when it comes to playing extended arpeggio runs and visualizing exotic scales. But I also think that misses the point. Every musician that attains any real level of mastery with their chosen instrument(s) has at some point come to realize an ultimate truth about their craft: there simply are no magic bullets. And while these systems can offer new paths to travel, there simply are no substitutes for time spent with your hands on the instrument, making music in as many ways as you possibly can. In other words, it's like everything in life: what you get out of it is a direct result of what you put into it. And with that in mind, my toolbox is more complete WITH this system than without it.",1417478400,6,2290,4.660891089108911

If you want an easy to understand method of learning music theory and how the guitar neck maps out then this is the book for you. It is simple yet thorough and takes you step by step through the CAGED method with lots of examples of songs and song recommendations. He show you how to apply what he teaches. That seems to be missing in a lot of other teaching! For the first time in my life I understand what I am playing and I can now improvise much more creatively than I could ever have dreamed!

Desi's system starts at the basics, working through all aspects of guitar theory. When you finish Desi's coarse you will completely understand how music is structured, as pertaining to fretboard.
Desi makes the journey fun while your learning, by playing songs that you like to play. This keeps you playing and learning for hours and looking forward to the next practice session, at least it did me.

I was able to play most chords in the open and A form barre but now with the CAGED so many more sounds and options. Never thought I'd be playing along with Clapton, Hendrix, and CCR, too much fun.

2750565,3,B000MVVE48,"The DVD does a good job of explaining the CAGED system, but it's nothing you couldn't learn for free on the internet. It's all theory, no real practice techniques. I understood the concept before I bought this and didn't learn anything new.",1351900800,5,240,4.738095238095238
2750566,5,B000MVVE48,"Before I discovered Desi, and this DVD in particular, I used to consider myself an intermediate guitar player.  I knew a bunch of songs, a good many chords, a handful of scales, and played in a few bands.  I never had a strong grasp on guitar music theory, and really found myself in a rut, creatively.  After following Desi Serna's system, starting with the book ""Fretboard Theory"" and adding in the DVD's as I had the time and money to purchase them, I can honestly say they have made the world of difference to my playing.  I now know I was a novice pretending to be an intermediate guitar player, and this system got me over that hump, and to actually being an intermediate guitar player.  The way Desi describes and uses the CAGED templates is invaluable!  After watching this DVD, and giving your honest effort to learn the songs he recommends and the theory behind them, including how the artist went about creating the chord voicings they used in those songs, you will be a better musician and gain a better understanding the fretboard.  You will be able to play a major chord anywhere on the fretboard, and be able to quickly pick out all of the notes that make up that chord anywhere on the fretboard, which can really help make your solos come alive.  I now look at music totally differently.  Before, I used to just mindlessly memorize and practice each piece of tablature until I had it down.  Now I look at a piece of music and I know all the chords they are using, what chords the inversions were derived from, why a particular solo sounds so amazing over a particular chord progression, etc.  I can't begin to tell you how valuable this DVD will be to you, especially if you are like me, and knew just a little bit about music theory, only the basics of the CAGED system, and want to be a better guitarist.

If you aren't sold, I do understand anything over $20 is tough in today's economy and it took me a while to convince myself too, check out his website at guitar - music - theory . com (without the spaces).  Desi shares valuable nuggets of information and free song lessons throughout his site.  You can contact him and he will respond, I have on a couple of occassions.  You can even rent this DVD online through Amazon and stream it for $2.99 before buying or get a free sample of the dvd from Desi's site by signing up for his mailing list.  You have nothing to lose by doing yourself a favor and checking it out.  I think you will be thoroughly satisfied if/when you make your purchase.",1336348800,10,2513,4.428260869565217

I really love the way Desi approaches teaching.
Especially, the quality of the camera woork, makes it really easy to see what he is trying to teach.

The approach of praticing the Chord, doing the Arpegio, then pratcing partial chord forms up and down the neck has really helped me to ""get it"".

Desi has a knack for presenting information clearly and with many references to well known songs and popular riffs.  This is not boring theory.  Everything he teaches is clearly shown in songs just about everyone has heard.  Desi has really done his homework.  Eveything from Keith Richards to Van Morrison.

I got the pentatonic scales, CAGED chords, progressions, and modes sets.  Instead of getting the DVD's, I just downloaded them.  This way I could easliy watch them on my laptop, pause and rewind when I needed.

Desi was quick to offer help when I needed it.  After watching the CAGED set I had a question on some chords I had been struggling with.  Desi emailed me back within 24 hours, gave me the answer I needed, and showed me where on the DVD I could find the answers.  He even provided some links to futher help me.

Buy this set.  I recommend it.  You won't be disappointed.

You can't go wrong with purchasing all of Desi's materials if you want to be a knowledgeable guitarist!",1200441600,14,724,4.526717557251908

I own them all, and have no complaints whatsoever. Desi has a way of simplifying guitar concepts and making them more digestible for the average person. This particular dvd will fill you in on the CAGED concept, giving you many popular music examples to learn from. I really can't say enough good things about Desi Serna's teaching style. I'm the kind of person who learns things bit by bit. One day I'll learn something new, the next someething else, etc. Because of Serna's down-to-Earth and practical teaching style, I was able to grasp more at a sitting than normal and I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to learn about the practical application of CAGED. As a side note on customer service, I received a bad Pentatonic dvd (I think these dvd transfer issues have since been corrected) and Mr. Serna responded to my email quickly and shipped a replacement out right away.",1198800000,,1010,4.84393063583815

So, I started looking for other lessons by him and discovered his books and now I own both Fretboard Theory books and the four DVD's that go with book one.  The best testimonial is that I had a problem with one of the CDs and emailed him and he responded by giving me access to it online! Great teacher, great guy. You will not regret a purchase made from any of Desi's books or CD's.  I plan to get his DVDs that go with book to next!",1452556800,,501,4.05050505050505
