973364,5,6305121702,"These are some of my favorite exercise tapes.  Total Body Workout has a leg, ab, chest and back section.  The back section requires either a barbell or pull-up bar.  Each of sections can be done by themselves for a quick 15 minute work-out.  The demonstrators each show a different version (advanced, intermediate, and beginner).  The exercises are basic military exercises.
The ab tape is tough.  It is the best ab tape I have used.
Some spotty production.  Scott counts outloud the exercise cadence, but the demonstrators do not count the repetitions.  It would be nice to hear the repetitions so I could judge my progress.  I am still trying to do as many flutter kicks as Scott.
I recommend this tape for any Army soldiers looking to improve their PT test scores or get ready for a hooah school.  I would also recomend this tape to any one who is looking for a solid military boot camp type workout - this is the real deal.",1006300800,13,927,4.5636363636363635
973365,5,6305121702,"The Navy Seal Workout is a great excercise video. But it might not be great if you are just starting to go into fitness and exercising. It covers all parts of the body and what I really liked about it was that it didn't have the common complicated dancy moves that most videos have that take you 20 viewings to get down. It makes you feel strong and it makes you feel good. There is a small segment in the video that requires either a device to do pull-ups on or simple barbells. But this is ""optional"" to do.",995241600,9,509,4.151515151515151
973366,5,6305121702,"Just bought this 3 tape set.  The total body workout is great they have 3 instructors simultaneously doing beginn, intermed, and advanced.  All body parts are worked out in this tape.  Liked that there wasn't a lot of talking common to these videos.  Ab workout is great too, it starts beginner section, intermediate, and then advanced.  Good tapes all around to give a no fuss, not a lot of BS, plain old good workout.",986947200,8,419,4.608108108108108
973367,5,6305121702,"If you're looking for fitness results this is for you. If you're  interested in models jumping around in spandex pretending to exercise look  elsewhere. Scott Helventston is a master trainer. This is a no frills total  body workout using virtually no equipment except your mind, body, and  attitude. I've used all three tapes. The total body workout does just  that-you work every muscle group. Start with this tape, movements and  exercises are best explained here and not as detailed on the other tapes.  The ab-blast will shape your abs. It's a quick 15 minute workout for your  abs, you choose from beginning, intermediate, or advanced and progress from  there. Excellent for a daily ab routine. The aerobic work out is the best of  its kind. Unlike most aerobic exercise tapes/programs this workout again  hits all the muscle groups, not just your legs and lower body. No frills. No  flash. No machinery. Not a ""slick production"",but great results if  you do as Helvenston says. No better workout tape out!",965606400,39,1011,4.946428571428571
7884002,5,6305121702,"Look elsewhere if your looking for bells and whistles.  This doesn't have it.  Looking for great choreography, go to Jane Fonda.  Good camera?  Look at Thai Bo.  Want a workout that will challenge you every step of the way, this is it!

Side note, rest in peace Scott.  May you be at peace sitting at the right hand of the lord.  You didn't deserve to die the way you did.",1277164800,,372,4.214285714285714
7884003,5,6305121702,"Scott's workout techniques are second to none. If you want to be in top notch SEAL shape this is the tapes for you. Scott was a great SEAL,trainer, and American.",1177027200,,161,4.4
7884004,4,6305121702,"All in all, I found this video to be helpful and extremely challenging.  Scott fullfills his promise to provide a total body workout and introduced me to a few new exercises along the way.  There are 2 other participants in the video, a male doctor and a female physical therapist, who complete the moves at an intermediate and beginner level.  As one would expect, Scott performs at the advanced level - a level I haven't achieved yet in this program!

Truly, I have a whole new respect for the Hell that those guys go through.  I was unable to do 2 of the advanced moves, but I could accomplish all of the beginner moves and *most* of the intermediate.

Exercises include:  traditional, military pushups (done at a brisk pace  *wheeze!*), tricep pushups, ""divebomber pushups"" (an exercise I haven't mastered yet), neck rolls, calf raises, lunges and squat thrusts (Have mercy!), a variety of abs moves, and pullups (or bent over rows if you're a beginner).

This routine uses your own body weight for resistance and the only optional piece of equipment needed is a pullup bar or a bar bell.

Kara's Tip:  If you're new to pullups or unable to do them using your FULL body weight, try using a broom handle and 2 chairs, instead.  Position the chairs so that the seats face each other.  Lie down between the 2 chairs and place the broom handle on the seat cushions above you.  You can do 1/2 pullups this way and strengthen the muscles in your arms.

It should be noted that this video was filmed outdoors on a beach, so the sound quality is poor at times.  Scott also stumbles through his words occasionally and adds a rep or two by accident, so don't expect perfection from this.  His form and advice are without fault, and that was what mattered most to me.

Wow Scale:  8 (out of 10)

Difficulty:  Intermediate - Advanced

Studio setting:  a pleasant beach",1112745600,4,1860,4.586626139817629
7884005,5,6305121702,"Using this set of videos, tayloring what parts I do to my abilities (at first I could only do 1/2 of the cardio and would end up with my head between my legs, swearing I was going to faint), I have worked off 76 pounds, leaving me with about 25 more to go.  This is no fluff video. 76 pounds later and I'm still at the beginning level! (Actually, I recently graduated to intermediate abs.)

I especially like the fact that I do not need a bunch of gym equipment. Doing a push-up with 100 extra pounds on me was pleanty of resistance (smile).  The first time my elbow slammed into my knee during a set of sit-ups (bruising it no less) I was estatic!

If you're serious about working off pounds and/or toning up, this is the video for you. I can't tell you how wonderful it feels to look and feel better at 40 than I did at 30.  My husband and I use these tapes to work out together and both of our physical fitness needs are met at the same time.

Don't give up on yourself an keep doing it and before you know it the pounds will start melting off.",1112313600,3,1047,4.082926829268293
7884006,5,6305121702,"This video may seem boring to some with the canned music but the routine is what counts. If you are willing to stick it out you will get results pretty quick, in my case a few months. I started these tapes at 34 yrs old and am in excellent shape at a nice ripe 37, much better shape than my mid twenties. Older guys can do this! These routines will be difficult at first but will get easier over time. They will give you a great basic workout that is easy to remember and right to the point. In 4 weeks you'll see the muscles building and in two months you will be impressed with the progress you make and the energy level boost you get. If you appreciate the lean muscular military body look this will help get you there, if you eat healthy you will really tone up fast. Start off every other day and eventually work up to a daily routine. You can do these excercises in a relatively small space and they keep you in shape during the winter months. The biggest part of this is not quitting and staying on a regular schedule. This is the stuff we grew up with - finally workout videos for the guys! The only easy day was yesterday.",1098576000,3,1131,4.168949771689498
7884007,5,6305121702,"I bought this set of videos 2 years ago, and I love them!  I think Scott is a great trainer, and you can get in good shape without having to buy weights.
I highly recommend this set if you want to turn yourself around from a couch potato into a more healthy lifestyle!",1065225600,,268,4.056603773584905
7884008,5,6305121702,"Great video, no ""fluff"" in it. I mainly use the ""Total body workout"" video and I have nothing but praise for it. If you want a calisthenic routine that gets down to business, this is the right video for you. I've done calisthenic workouts for years, and felt as though I had some holes in my routine. This workout is perfect for my needs, it fills those gaps which I previous had in my own routine.
If you want a dancey, spandex wearing fluff video you should probably choose something else.",1056844800,5,491,4.406593406593407
7884009,3,6305121702,"To start these video exercises are lead by Scott Helventon, the youngest person to every become a SEAL at age 17. This is the same Scott who was in Delta squad of ""Combat Missions"" blowing up every episode. The videos are easy to follow and have 3 levels for each set of exercises. It starts out with a stretching exercises on a sandy cliff overlooking a beach. It's not a military video and more like a tv exercise show like on ESPN. There's a girl training with him to provide a sense of a co-ed workout. I do have a problem with intermediate and advance levels requiring exercise equipment like a pull-up bar. Updated Revision: I'm sorry to hear he was killed in Iraq and he will be greatly missed. He didn't have to be there and yet he went where he was needed. Rest in Peace young warrior.",1042934400,7,794,4.3355704697986575
7884010,5,6305121702,"The programs start out pretty gentle with warm-ups and then move into the move demanding exercises. The exercises include a couple of static stretches as well as a few active ones. Some of the calisthenics are pretty much like in high school gym class but there are a few I've never seen. Instead of traditional sit-ups there are many crunch variations. You usually get to see the techniques from 2 or 3 angles simultaneously and most of the movements are simple to learn. The unique 4-count jumping-jacks were, however, a challenge to my coordination. My favorite exercises have always been push-ups and pull-ups and these tapes have plenty! There is also an alternative exercise for those who aren't ready to do pull-ups. I would think a fairly active person, or one who goes to a gym two or three times a week would be at least ready for the beginning level on these tapes.",1025308800,6,876,4.694805194805195
