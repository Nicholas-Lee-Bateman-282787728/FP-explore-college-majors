3589627,5,B001FYD354,This is a very good concert and funk don't get no better. Some of the picture quality various from each artist. The sound is good but not great. If you're a real funk person than you will want this for your collection. Don't go to sleep because material for these artist is getting harder and harder to find. So get down on it and get with it.,1251158400,3,343,4.134328358208955

3589629,5,B001FYD354,"This is a fantastic show!  It consist of the Whispers, Lakeside, Dynasty, and Shalamar.  They appear in that order.  What I love about this show is that I love these groups, and each group gives you a full set - 45 minutes or more.  This is absolutely one to have because the performances are top notch.  This show captures the energy of when we were younger, and loving to party - if you are in your 50's.  It's when groups were really hot, back in the 70's and 80's, and people really could sing, in stead of the current manufactured music.  It's a long show, so, you really get your money's worth.  The Whispers are outstanding - a true class act, singing favorites like Olivia, Lady, Let's go all the way, A song for Donny, and The beat goes on, The only negative I found with the show, was that Shalamar video quality was not as good as the first 3 groups  They don't do any closeups, during their performance..  Not sure why.  However the sound and their performance was fantastic. Also, since this show was done during the earlier years, it does not have all of Lakeside greatest hits, but they give a stellar performance on ""Giving into Love, and ""Pull my string"". I still give it 5 stars because of the performances, the length - 45 minutes or more, per group, the sound quality, and how well they captured the energy of the concert experience.  Get the show.",1397260800,,1368,4.428

3589634,2,B001FYD354,"As much as I love these groups, I have to say that I am truly disappointed by the quality of this production. The video looks like someone took their cheap personal video camera and filmed the artists performances from the back row of the theatre. During the performances you can actually see people walking in front of the camera on their way back to their seats! The person recording the video was so far away from the stage that you can't even see the artists faces. Ocassionally there would be a closer shot of the artists from somewhere off the right-hand side of the stage, but those were the only two views used. Although I enjoyed the artists performances, the quality of this production was so poor that it actually made me dislike this DVD. I would not recommend this DVD to others.",1357689600,4,792,4.545454545454546

little offputting but because i am a fan of the whispers the concert i thought was O.K.",1350518400,,331,4.724137931034483
3589636,5,B001FYD354,"Ran across this rare gem a few years ago. As a lover of the now defunct Solar Records and all the groups here, I was shocked, but gracious to see it. The Whispers have been around for years doing there thing, and I've been lucky so them in concert many times over the years. Have never been lucky enough to see Lakeside, Shalamar, or Dynasty. Both Shalamar and especially Dynasty had relatively short careers, and never passed my way. Had a chance to finally see Lakeside a few years ago, but they unfortunately had to cancel at the last minute.

All four groups play sets of between about 21-46 minutes. Dynasty's set being the obvious shortest. Not much info given on this concert on the dvd. It was apparently played outdoors at the Concord Pavilion, in Concord California. I'm gonna guess sometime in 1981. Appears to be early in Dynasty and Lakeside's careers. The playset is obviously mixed-up, with the Whispers, who clearly came on last, playing first on this disk. You can tell because it's lite outside when Dynasty came on, and dark outside when the Whispers come on.

Dynasty comes on first. They weren't together long, and apparently rarely toured. They put on a 21 minute spirited set, in front of a mostly disinterested crowd. I liked it though. Leon Silvers Bass was as funky as they come, and two girl pair of Linda Carriere and Nidra Beard were fun to watch.

Lakeside is by far, one of the most underrated funk bands I've ever known. The extremely lively group put on a 38 minute set that had the crowd jamming and into it. Marvin Craig's bass thomps thoughtout, and the co-lead singers on Mark Woods and Otis Stokes play off each other brilliantly.

Shalamar was the group I really wanted to see. Growing up, they had a reputation of putting on great live shows. They don't disappoint here. The three player set of Howard Hewett, Jody Watley, and Jeffery Daniels, simply can't be touched IMHO. Too bad internal griping tore them up, because they had something unique and rare. They put on a diverse and entergetiic show, with everything from Disco, R&B, and very early Hip Hop. Sorry Michael Jackson fans, but Jeffery Daniels moonwalk,then called the backslide, simply can't be beat. Jody & Howard brilliantly trade off vocals, as they were known to do, but never miss a step while dancing. Unfortunately it's all shot from a distance, with no real close-ups for some reason, but still it's a sight to behold.

The well established Whispers close out the concert with their trademark sense of slow jams and upbeat jams. They brought the crowd to their feet and brought the house down. The twin lead Scott brothers never sounded better.

This is rare material here  folks, probably why it costs so much. Well worth it IMO though. Probably can't or won't find anything else like it ever.",1305158400,9,2805,4.70061099796334

8303112,3,B001FYD354,"Watching this video brought back for me fond memories.
I may be a lil bias in that I literally started my music career around these recording artists! If I had to complain about anything...the group Shalamar's entire performance was filmed from the nose bleeding distance! Unlike the 3 previous acts here, there were absolutely no close up shots. Honestly,  U can't tell who the members of Shalamar are from this footage! So for that reason alone I think $10.00 should be knocked off the price tag! (Hint, hint/LOL)
Other that, it's a pretty good video!
Enjoy!",1438473600,,560,4.833333333333333
8303113,5,B001FYD354,"I bought quite some time ago but never wrote the review. Love the show! It as filmed from a bit of a distance away from the stage but that did not stop me from enjoying Shalamar over and over again. Shalamar was by far the best! Jody Watley, Howard Hewitt and Jeffrey Daniel were the best not only on this DVD but of all the acts at that time.
