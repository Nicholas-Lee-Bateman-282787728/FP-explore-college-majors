6987730,5,B00SJ9TRDA,"Same level of quality that we have come to rely on. Some amazing surprises. Todd and Adam are finding their legs ;-) but you can't go wrong with Wes and David. Thanks for keeping this up, Bill. God knows you don't need the money and you're pushing 80 and most folks 20 years younger than you only want to think of retirement. God bless you, sir.",1427500800,4,345,4.242424242424242
6987731,4,B00SJ9TRDA,"PERFECT AS USUAL... THE ONLY REASON WHY I PLACED 4 STARS, ITS BECAUSE THE CASE IS SMALLER THAN THE REGULAR DVD PACK. (MAYBE THATS WHY ITS CHEAPER OVER HERE)
BUT OH WELL, WHAT MATTERS IS THE CONTENT.",1426809600,4,198,4.378378378378378

6987733,5,B00SJ9TRDA,"Bought as a Christmas/Birthday gift for our youngest son who is a die hard Gaither Vocal Band fan. Our whole family are also fans, but he is the biggest in the family. We just added to his collection with this one.",1466121600,,214,4.2439024390243905

6987735,4,B00SJ9TRDA,"To be fair to those who have not yet purchased this DVD, I gave four stars rather than five, because of the darkness of the picures.

EVERY PIECE DONE BY THE VOCAL BAND WAS ENJOYABLE, AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST SO VERY SPECIAL THAT I LISTENED TO IT FOUR TIMES THE FIRST DAY. MY FAVORITE OF THE PIECES DONE BY OTHERS WAS THE ISAACS. BECKY SCARCELY GOT THE FIRST WORD OUT OF HER MOUTH BEFORE I CHOKED UP.  WHAT THAT SONG HAS TO SAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN SPECIAL TO ME. I USED TO SING IT A LOT, ESPECIALLY IN THE BASEMENT OF MY PARENT'S HOME, WHILE I DID MY WASHING. IT WAS A VERY CONFUSING AND HEARTBREAKING TIME OF MY LIFE, BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD IT SUNG BETTER THAN THIS TIME, WITH THE ISAACS. WHAT A MOVING ARRANGEMENT, AND WHAT PASSION. GOOD JOB, AND IT CAME FROM THE HEART, I COULD TELL.

WES REALLY GAVE OF HIMSELF. SO FUN TO WATCH, AND SO SINCERE. HE IS SUCH A FINE HUMAN BEING. MY GOODNESS, IT DOES MY HEART GOOD TO HEAR HIM SING. DAVID IS SO SPECIAL, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND ANY MORE WORDS. THE TWO NEW GUYS FIT RIGHT IN, DON'T THEY?  I JUST WANTED TO HUG ADAM.  THAT FELLOW IS THE REAL DEAL, AS THEY SAY.  IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER SEEN TOM/TOD? SING.  IN THE SECOND PART OF 'LET IT START WITH ME' HE HAD ME SITTING ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. YOU GO, DEAR BROTHER AND I WILL LEARN YOUR NAME. My years are showing.

WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME I HAVE HAD WITH THIS DVD. I HAVE LIKE OH SIXTY SIX OF THESE VIDEOS, AND I INTEND TO GUY A COUPLE OR THREE OF THIS PARTICULAR ONE TO SEND TO FRIENDS.  VERY MOVING, VERY TOUCHING, AND THERE WERE ONLY TWO SONGS THAT I DID NOT CARE MUCH FOR; ALL THE OTHERS WERE REALLY SOMETHING. A LOT OF WORK WENT INTO THAT VIDEO.  THANK YOU GUYS, ALL OF YOU, AND HOW ABOUT THAT NEW PIANO PLAYER, I LIKED HIM ON THE TWO 'PURE & SIMPLE' DVD'S. THOSE WERE GOOD TOO.  MR. GAITHER, YOU JUST NEVER STOP. HOW DO YOU DO IT?",1460937600,,1840,3.945945945945946

6987738,5,B00SJ9TRDA,"I absolutely love the harmony and sound of the Vocal Band. It is the best combination ever!  The DVD is amazingly dark.  It could be the lighting there where it was recorded.  I have never seen this poor quality in any other DVD or VHS.  Since I love the songs and the group so much, I was disappointed.",1458000000,,303,4.172413793103448

6987742,1,B00SJ9TRDA,"On finally getting to play the DVD 10-4-15, I find the video and vocal are out of sync by 1.5 to 2 seconds, entirely ruining the viewing and listing experience. Gaither Music Company's response via email was basically 'tough luck, contact Amazon not us'.  Don't waste you money on this DVD!",1444003200,,290,4.686274509803922
6987743,3,B00SJ9TRDA,"looked forward to the new Gaither Vocal Band dvd but a little disappointed. The lighting means that Tom sometimes appears to ""disappear"" but the music is good and it's always great to catch up with the Homecoming family.",1441756800,,220,4.815789473684211
6987744,5,B00SJ9TRDA,thanks,1437004800,,6,6.0
6987745,5,B00SJ9TRDA,I have many gaither dvds and cds and enjoy all of them. The harmony is so close and unless one voice is highlited you can hardly tell who is singing what part. I have always felt that is true musicianship. The great thing about them is the variety of the music they sing. Real feel good moments!!,1435190400,2,296,4.2105263157894735
6987746,5,B00SJ9TRDA,One more time the Gaithers do an outstanding job. I love this music and the new group is fabulous!,1434931200,,98,4.2105263157894735

6987750,5,B00SJ9TRDA,Might be the greatest dvd ever made.  what a great SPIRITUAL BLESSING it brought me.  No doubt the Gaither Band sing from a Godly dedicated spirit as they sing wonderful praises to God and allow the viewer to worship along with them.,1432944000,,233,4.523809523809524

6987754,3,B00SJ9TRDA,"I have almost every Gaither video which I would give 4 or 5 stars but this one disappointed me.  I waited patiently for it to be released because I wanted to see the new Vocal Band but I could hardly see them.  The concert was recorded at the Feek Farm almost in the dark.  It may have been an intimate setting for the audience but watching the DVD was difficult.  The only lighting consisted of some dim spotlights over the stage.  When the camera showed the audience, I could hardly make out who they were.  And from some camera angles, it was also difficult to even see the performers.  There were some new songs I thought were really good and I liked the new Vocal Band but the poor lighting really took away my enjoyment of this video.",1430524800,9,740,4.318840579710145

on this occasion desepcionado of:
poor sound quality
lousy image quality
audio and image do not match
