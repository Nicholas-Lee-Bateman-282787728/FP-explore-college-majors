3845386,5,B00247XURC,"Is a great DVD for who can't move very well, I had and accident a year ago and I have severe trouble to move my leg, this DVD allows me to do the exercise with a chair and I am improving !!! Enjoy!!!",1287619200,11,199,3.6511627906976742
3845387,5,B00247XURC,"I am resuming yoga practice after many years. I found Peggy Cappy's dvds and book, and I ordered this dvd as well. I have (at 58) issues with stiff places, sore places and cannot do some poses without modifications. I wanted to learn Sun Salutation, but I am not able to get up and down from the floor to do this the usual way..Peggy's dvd will enable me to learn Sun Salute and still gain the benefits of the pose..she is a caring and patient teacher.",1277510400,22,452,4.267441860465116
3845388,5,B00247XURC,"I'm more likely to work out, if I don't have to set-up a place on the floor, get the mat, etc. If you don't use a mat, you need to be careful, or your feet can slip. Saw this on the PBS show, and I'm glad I did. I do the exercises holding on to the computer desk. Highly recommended.",1275091200,21,283,3.7333333333333334
3845389,5,B00247XURC,"When people tell me that yoga is only good for stretching, but doesn't improve cardio fitness, I recommend this video. Done slowly, the Sun Salutations are great for endurance, flexibility, and strength. Done more quickly, you add the benefit of cardio exercise.

I love this video because Peggy breaks down the Saluations into an easy to learn flow.

The chair version of Sun Saluation on this video also makes the Sun Saluation accessible to people who cannot work comfortably on the floor. This is also a great start for people who need to improve their flexibility, but need to start with a variation that is doable and then work their way into more advanced version. (And as trainers know, being successful is motivating.)

First thing in the morning I start with the chair version and then move on to the floor version as I limber up a bit.

During my last physical, my doctor noted that I had lost 11 lbs. in the last year. I told her it was my morning Sun Saluations.",1266019200,35,975,4.586206896551724
3845390,1,B00247XURC,"I enjoy all of Peggy Cappy's yoga programs, however, this one which is mostly sun salutations should have had a warning that someone with wrist issues will be unable to perform it.  Weight bearing on the wrists is required.",1262217600,67,223,4.717948717948718
3845391,5,B00247XURC,"If you have heart disease or want to take proactive steps to avoid it, this DVD is for you!  Yoga has been proven to help lower stress levels, reduce blood pressure, lower heart rate, improve lung capacity, etc.  In this DVD, Peggy Cappy guides you in a series of sun salutations specifically targeted to improve heart health.  Peggy has a calming voice and her instructions are easy to follow. Her students come in all shapes and sizes so you need not be intimidated by spandex-wearing models. I suggest watching the DVD from start to finish before you begin. In one segment, Peggy's students give testamonials about how yoga has benefited them.  Watching the students in class while listening to their first-hand stories is truly motivational!!!!",1253836800,36,748,4.96
3845392,4,B00247XURC,"I give this product 5 stars! Heart Healthy Yoga provides a wonderful way to begin or end one's day.  Sun Salutations contain movements that work every part of the body.  Even as few as three rounds a day can produce remarkable results. I have been using Sun Salutations (Heart Healthy Yoga) on a regular basis for over a year and a half and have seen major changes in my body during that time.  Without dieting I have lost at least 20 pounds, trimmed my waist, lowered my cholesterol level, strengthened my thighs and arms, improved my flexibility and gained a new body.  The wonderful part about this product is that it offers the material, first in an instructive way (to learn the sequences of the movements) and then gives you a 1/2 hour class in both a modified and a classical way.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone - beginners or experienced students.",1253750400,98,862,4.571428571428571
3845393,4,B00247XURC,"Primarily repetitions of sun salutations.  It's a little repetitive, although I do like Peggy Cappy's approach.",1447545600,,111,5.9375
3845394,1,B00247XURC,"Please be aware that this DVD is filled with Sun Salutations. I have over 350 fitness Dvds and about 30 of them are yoga. I was surprised to see that the practice consists of Sun Salutations over and over, really weird and super boring. It was a total waste of money for me. Peggy is a good instructor and I will order more of her Dvds but this one I will never do again. Weirdest thing ever...5, 6, 7 rounds of sun salutation???? Smh!!",1442534400,,436,4.2023809523809526

3845398,5,B00247XURC,"I was looking for a cardiac workout that would also embrace my love of yoga. Peggy Cappy is fantastic. She is clear, concise and patient and offers demonstrated modifications of each posture and routine. I am going to buy all of her dvds.",1428278400,,238,4.558139534883721

3845400,5,B00247XURC,"This is the 3rd copy of this I bought.  I had one, bought a 3 pack that included it, gave the extra away, then gave away a dvd player that I replaced and accidently gave away my copy of this.  I freaked and immediately ordered another.  It's a great work out for people with arthritis.  I'm a 46 year old fat chick diagnosed with RA about 15 years ago.  This dvd is wonderful!!  I can do it, it makes me feel good both mentally and physically.  ANYBODY can do this work out!!",1426636800,,475,4.0978260869565215

3845402,4,B00247XURC,"I haven't been working out in awhile, and I wanted something that would ease me back into exercising, without placing a lot of stress on my joints or making me out-of-breath in 5 minutes.  This workout fits the bill.  It is basically the Sun Salutation yoga routine, repeated several times.  The instructor provides two different ways to perform it: the traditional way which ( be warned) places a fair amount of pressure on your hips, knees, and wrists; and a modified version which involves using a chair, limiting some of the weight-bearing issues and avoiding balance problems.  For those who are older or not used to yoga, I would start with the chair routine and then move into the traditional one.  (Quite frankly, if you're already a yoga devotee, this video is probably too easy for you.) I was surprised (and a little embarrassed) that just doing the several repetitions of the pose caused me to get out of breath.  But that's a good thing-- it's a good workout and very pleasant DVD.  I recommend it.",1421712000,5,1011,4.7102272727272725

3845405,5,B00247XURC,"What can I say - I love Peggy Cappy.  I ordered all of the DVDs available from amazon.  Simple to follow.  Not too advanced for the beginner or the elderly.  Well illustrated.  Excellent verbal instruction..  Excellent discussion of the reasons-why.  I will use the same praise for all of the Peggy Cappy DVDs.

3845408,5,B00247XURC,"Peggy Cappy is such a wonderful teacher.
She has great ways to help us keep healthy.
She comes up with brilliant stuff to adapt to yoga postures that may be too much for some of us. We still get the benefit of the pose without trying to be a cirque de soleil performer.

3845410,5,B00247XURC,"When I got Peggy's tapes I was over 200 pounds.  I have bought other tapes to try to exercise and do yoga but was not able to do the exercises.  Peggy's tape are wonderful, she always shows different ways of doing each exercise by way of having a room of people doing the same thing but different.  She spends time explaining each step and always letting you know if you can not lay on your back you are getting the same benefit by doing this in a chair, if you can not stand on one foot you will reap the same benefit by doing.....
All exercises have a variety of ways to do them and she is not a show off and is usually doing the simple way, letting others do the medium and more difficult ways.",1403827200,6,697,4.072992700729927
3845411,5,B00247XURC,I chose this because I currently take a Yoga class for seniors and this DVD will help me to do some yoga at home on days that I don't get to the gym. I find yoga to be very relaxing and it has helped me with my balance.,1398902400,,219,3.5833333333333335

3845414,5,B00247XURC,"I highly recommend Peggy Cappy's dvds for yoga, even if u are not exercising. No strain in yoga. never forced, always gentle, and u go at your own pace. It is very tranquilizing to body mind and spirit to do yoga. A tonic. It will help ease aches and pains, and take you off meds for pain, and help bones, tendons, and muscles, and body alignment. This ancient practice has been much needed in our western culture for so long. Love to be at home, not a class. I want the quiet of solitude for yoga in front of me.",1391644800,,513,4.14
3845415,5,B00247XURC,"All of Peggy Cappy's DVDS are excellent.  I have most of her DVDs.  Her instruction is so clear and her voice is so reassuring and calming.  These DVDs have served me quite well alleviating a low  back pain I had developed. At 59 years of age, it is important to maintain a level of exercise which will be beneficial to staying active and healthy.  I had never before tried yoga, but have learned it is great, and Peggy's instruction was so helpful.",1391558400,,449,4.426829268292683

This dvd is ideal and I will be using it alot.

3845420,5,B00247XURC,"For those of us that have been around the block a few times, this is the perfect yoga DVD. Peggy is such a pro, guiding watchers through the moves and stretches calmly, slowly and with care. If you are young and have done yoga at an advanced level, this may be too slow. For me, it is perfect. Yoga for the rest of us, just as the title says!",1378684800,,342,3.971014492753623
3845421,2,B00247XURC,This is an extremely slow basic repetitious DVD for anyone over 80 who's not too active.  Peggy also spends far too much time talking instead of just explaining a move and flowing through it.  So you are either standing and waiting or fast forwarding through a lot of this.  Another thing about Peggy's DVD's is the unnecessary commentary at the beginning of all her DVD's as well as the infomercial at the end of all DVD's talking about her accomplishments and client testimonials.,1371859200,,482,4.783132530120482

3845426,4,B00247XURC,"This is the best of Peggy Cappy's DVD series especially for Cardio Exercise.  She takes the time to teach the ""Sun Salutation"" step by step.  I am in my middle 50's and my body hurts after a night of work, this routine helps me relax and work through my soreness. I have enjoyed all her Yoga DVD's, this is the one  that I like the best, I am able to get my heart rate up enough that I feel I am doing some good for myself without having to run, dance or jump around.

This video, Heart Healthy Yoga, teaches two versions of sun salutations, one is a traditional floor version, and one uses a chair  The chair version just raises the floor, you aren't sitting in a chair to do the workout.
