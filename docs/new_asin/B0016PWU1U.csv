8263932,5,B0016PWU1U,"After watching volume 5 of ""Super Robot Wars OG: DIVINE WARS"", I'm just left with an impression of ""WOW!""

Things pick up quite quickly and if you thought the mecha battles from the previous episodes were awesome, prepare yourself as the Earth Federation and the United Colony Corps finally go against each other head on!

Definitely a must watch volume in the series thus far!

In episode 12 titled ""Stage 12: The Trap"", inside the assault cruiser Hagwane, Aya collapses during a conditioning session using the T-Link Ssytem.  And the DC Armored Modules led by Tomas Pratt launches a sudden attack.

We are introduced to Hikawa Ryoto, similar to Ryusei and Tenzan, a player of the robot fighting game ""Burning PT"" who doesn't realize that what he is involved in right now is not a game, it's all out war and people die!

Hiroto is a shy, pure-hearted guy who is among the ""advanced children"" discovered by Adler Koch of the Divine Crusaders and he's more or less a computer and technology geek.

Another key character that the storyline focuses on is the character of Rio Meilong.  She was shown briefly as a character welcoming Kusuha to the Hagwane but now that she is being trained as a pilot, you learn that Rio is the daughter of Ewan Meilong, a top executive of Personal Trooper manufacturer Mao Industries and has an unknown hatred towards the Divine Crusaders.

In episode 13 titled ""Stage 13: Premonitions of War"", a transport vessel headed toward the Hagwane comes under fire by Armored Modules piloted by Divine Crusaders pilots Tomas and Tenzan and ultimately leading to a confrontation between Ryusei and his ""Burning PT"" rival Tenzan.

For this episode, the episode actually focuses on character development of Latun Subbota, a member of the Earth Federation Army's Far East Branch.

Known for wearing thick sunglasses and lacking emotions, it is revealed that Latun is a former member of the School and because of the brutal training and experimentation, she has a fear of socializing.  That is until she meets Ryusei.

In episode 14 titled ""Stage 14: Operation Breakout"", the success of Operation Mururoa (an operation to take over satellite communications away from the Earth Federation Army) has given the United Colony Corps control of space.

The United Colony Corps is led by Commander-in-Chief Maier Von Branstein and their goal is to invade Geneva, the heart of the Federation Government and with the Treue Unit (the gifted pilots of the United Colony) eliminating the majority of the Earth Federation Army in space, power will be with the Divine Crusaders.

With the odds against them, this gives the Earth Federation Army one chance to become successful and that is to send both assault carriers, the Hiryu Kwai and the Hwagane and the personnel troopers in an all out battle against the United Colony Corps.

And with episode 14, what a battle it was.  An amazing episode that features mecha battles galore.  From ATX Team Kyosuke Nanbu going against his former leader (turned traitor) Major Sanger Zonvolt and just an all out war between the United Colony Corps and Treue Unit versus the Personnel Troopers of the Earth Federation Army was just all out mecha eye candy.

Definitely one of the highlights from the series thus far!  Amazing!

This series continues to get better and better with each episode and similar to the last volume, it's great to get more character development for some of the characters and finally it was learned why Latun is the way she is and also seeing her willing to try different things in her life and having more human reactions.  Especially experiencing human emotions, which was great to see.

As for the introduction of another character with Hikawa Ryoto.  At first, I was like ""another character?"" but the way the storyline was written and how Ryoto becomes instrumental in the upcoming episodes was good planning and I look forward in seeing how his technological sense comes to play in future episodes.

But of course, for volume 5... it's all about episode 14.  There have been major mecha battles so far in the series but the battle between the Earth Federation Army's personnel troopers (mechas) versus the pilots of the Treue Unit and the United Colony Corps will probably be known for its epic mecha battle and a strategy used by the Earth Federation Army was just amazingly planned.

I can't help but watching episode 14 several times over and over because it was that good!

All in all, this volume was enjoyable and just continues to be the ultimate in mecha fan service!",1218153600,,4546,4.868831168831169
