8599051,4,B0000TSR5G,"I NetFlix this movie thinking that it was a spoof on ""Titanes en el Ring"" the Spanish version of WWF back in the 1970s.
Instead I was treated to a serious portrayal of current life in the Andes.
I was born in Ecuador and grew up in the Andes. Not far from where this movie was filmed. This is a very accurate depiction of Life in the Andes.
The acting is more suited for theater than film, but it is consistent with what is expected in hard drama of this nature for the intended national audience.
I highly recommend this movie to audiences interested in culture and the Andean way of life. Especially considering that for some of the actors this may not be fiction.",1083024000,3,666,4.336
