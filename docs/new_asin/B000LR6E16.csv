8163799,3,B000LR6E16,"I recently bought this video, First of all it is an cargo airline, I was expecting a passenger one.
The video quality is good but not excellent, its in english but spoken by italians so their english is no so good, you cant hear everything they do, and they don't explain what they r doing. The only good explanation is the introduction to the panels where they describe the functions of most of the buttons  in it.
I would have likeed to have explained how do they use the auto pilot, when do they engage it, how they use to do the approach insted of just having a cockpit view of the approach.",1205107200,4,595,4.265486725663717
