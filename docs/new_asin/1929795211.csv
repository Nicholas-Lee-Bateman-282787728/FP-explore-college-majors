I would recommend it to others also looking for general information on the subject.",1356652800,,196,4.909090909090909
7801307,4,1929795211,"This is a good DVD for someone (like me) who really knows nothing about ""triking."" It gives you (as advertised) an introduction to what ultralight triking is all about. There are many different instructors
interviewed, which I think would help you to figure out what you would want in a qualified teachers. It looks like a lot of fun, but i'm afraid of heights. One of the instructors explained how he made sure the student had time ""to get used to"" the feeling of flying and height, etc. before anything else was attempted. That seems very sensible to me. I found it relaxing to watch.",1353715200,,586,4.59047619047619
7801308,1,1929795211,"This DVD is little more then an commercial.
You learn nothing about actually flying one.
It really isn't even a good overview of flying a trike.",1343692800,,144,4.576923076923077
