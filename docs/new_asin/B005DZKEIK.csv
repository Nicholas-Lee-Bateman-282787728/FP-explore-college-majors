8467786,5,B005DZKEIK,"Alice and Martin Jarett (Lynne Adams and Pierre Lenoir) are going through some problems. This is due to Alice's deteriorating mental state. She suffers from delusions and unpredictable behavior. Her doctor suggests some time in the country, so, Martin buys a house in a rural location. It's a fixer-upper, needing lots of work. One evening, Alice hears someone working late in the basement. Upon investigation, she meets the titular artisan (Wings Hauser- MUTANT, NIGHTMARE AT NOON) hammering away. Later, she learns that this man isn't part of the crew that's actually working on the house! When one of the workmen attacks Alice, he's interrupted by THE CARPENTER (1988), bearing a saw w/ which to remove the man's limbs! Ouch! It's clear that nothing is going stop him from remodeling this house! Meanwhile, we learn a couple of things about Martin: THING #1- He's an unreasonable a$$! THING #2- He's having an affair! One day, the sheriff stops by and tells Alice all about her new pal. #1- His name is Ed. #2- He's not quite alive! #3- He was a homicidal maniac! As it turns out, this comes in very handy, since there are several annoying pests about. HINT TO MARTIN: You had better mind your P's and Q's, or you just might end up ""remodeled"" yourself! The best part of this movie? It's an insanely ghoulish, ultimately tragic love story! With Martin being such a rat, it's not hard to guess what becomes of him. HINT: It involves a splitting headache! I had never heard of THE CARPENTER, and found it to be a truly unique horror movie experience!... P.S.- Wings Hauser's best role! Even better than VICE SQUAD!...",1523232000,,1618,4.7821428571428575
8467787,5,B005DZKEIK,"Very curious, well directed late 80s dark thriller. A cut above the rest (pun intended) Actress Lynne Adams reminds me much of Sigourney Weaver of this era. This is a film that will hook you in and not let go.
THE CARPENTER is an oddball little horror film of the 1980s given a new lease of life on DVD by Code Red. It's a cheap Canadian effort that nonetheless has a unique and odd little feel to it, a dream-like atmosphere you don't often see at this budget in this genre. The plot is reminiscent of TRULY, MADLY, DEEPLY, albeit with a murderous slant. A crazy young woman moves into a house which is being renovated and soon encounters Wings Hauser, the titular character, who is doing up her basement. The only problem is that a) he's a ghost, and b) he's a murderer. A string of cheesy power tool-assisted death scenes follows, hardly convincing, but mildly amusing for the horror lover. The acting is of a variably standard but Hauser is fun in a kooky way and the running time is too brief for this to outstay its welcome.",1523059200,,1030,4.426315789473684
8467788,4,B005DZKEIK,"the fact that ONLY The last few minutes are silly is Incredible!! Given the storyline.

I liked it.

I don't know what's scarier. I psychopathic killer or a person who is fine with a psychopathic killer!!

Fun to watch. A few good actors and some awful ones but the awful ones have bit parts.

Speaking of bits...",1521676800,,313,4.43859649122807
8467789,5,B005DZKEIK,"It's essentially Canadian style Stephen King with some Twin Peaks tossed in for good measure. Here Wings Hauser, blessings and peace be upon his name, plays a carpenter with a tendency to absolutely ruin rude and untidy people. He finds plenty of those unsavory types when he meets the owner of the new house he's working on. Pretty soon nail guns are being used as guns and drills are being used on softer surfaces.

It's all pretty goofy but it's kept on point by Wings doing his thing. He's completely unhinged here from the first frame he shows up in. There's really no build up to him being crazy. I got no problem with that. All out Wings is a lot like all out Nicolas Cage or Christopher Walken. It's wildly entertaining and actually pretty darn good acting of the James Cagney variety.

The rest of the movie is decent enough. It's clearly Canadian despite them trying to hide it. They have too many denim jackets and mullets for it to not be Canadian. It's got some appropriately Twin Peaks / David Lynch like moments that don't quite make it all the way but that has more to do with David Lynch's particular tastes than the failure of the film makers. I'd still have preferred Sherilyn Fenn to be honest.

Most importantly, Wings hair gets properly crazy. Walken and Cage level crazy. I hope some day that Wings gets his proper due or some sort of retrospective. I know most of this has been kinda cheeky but he's actually a great actor who brings energy and sense of fun regardless of the role he's playing to any production no matter how bad it is. Few actors are that dedicated.",1461801600,4,1591,4.498269896193771
8467790,4,B005DZKEIK,"Wings is not around as much as he use to be (I did see him in RUBBER recently and a few TV programs), but he use to be all over movies and TV in the 80's. This is not a great film, but Scorpion Releasing always manages to find the best-looking prints and this is the Unrated version to boot. BTW: If you are looking for a film by Scorpion Releasing or Code Red, there is no better seller than the_exterminator. The prices are usually lower than what Amazon charges and they are not used copies.",1400371200,2,494,4.15625
8467791,3,B005DZKEIK,"This is another 80's VHS nostalgia movie that I had to see on DVD.  Scorpion's pimping these horror movies out with class, and I respect them for it.  The movie itself is really a ghost story with a few slasher-type kills, but the kills aren't gory.  The real draw to the film is Wings Hauser and his connection with the house he's fixing.  The job must be done, and nobody's getting in this carpenter's way.

That said, it's not the greatest movie.  It's boring about sixty percent of the time.  The special effects are cheap. This is all for the camp value of Wing Hauser's performance.  I'd say if you're a collector, buy it, if you're curious but not a hardcore old school horror fan, rent this before buying.

For a slasher, this has a ghost story, a romance sub-plot, and of course, a crash course in home building.  Good, but not great.  Fun, but not a knee-slapper.  This movie gets a big ""It's just okay.""",1322697600,16,914,4.4397590361445785
