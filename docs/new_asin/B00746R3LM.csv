5053813,4,B00746R3LM,"I was 5 when I last saw this show, but I remember it being very funny. 50 years later it's still funny, great slapstick, and great performances by Astin & Ingels.  The sets are cheap, staging is dated, but it still made me laugh. One complaint only and that is that they should have added closed captioning. After 50 years I imagine a lot of the show's fans are hard of hearing.",1337990400,6,378,4.25
5053814,5,B00746R3LM,"Honestly, I had never heard of I'M DICKENS...HE'S FENSTER, so when it popped up on my Amazon recommendations list, I was intrigued.  I watched a few brief segments on the internet and liked what I saw, so I ordered it.  And, boy, am I glad I did!  This show is great, and it breaks my heart that we only have one season of it (It was canceled after the first season).  Harry Dickens and Archie Fenster are best friends who both work as carpenters for a construction firm.  Harry is married to Kate, but he dates vicariously through his friend Archie, who is something of a ladies man.  The three leads all have fantastic chemistry and form a seamless ensemble.  The show revolves around their schemes, misunderstandings, and and arguments, and it's wonderful.  The scripts are witty, the acting spot on, and the slapstick is classic.  My favorite episode is ""The Joke"" which revolves around a disagreement among Harry, Kate, and Archie over the funniness (or lack thereof) of a joke Harry wants to use during a speech he has to make.  It's Brilliant.

This three disc set contains half of the episodes from the first season and disc of special features, including a featurette on the physical comedy that is so integral to the show.  The latter half of the episodes is slated for a second set that can't come out soon enough for me.",1337212800,13,1332,4.5974576271186445
5053815,5,B00746R3LM,"This is a most impressive packaging of a show I fondly remembered from childhood. Lots of extras, superb picture quality. Two discs (16 episodes) of the show itself, and a bonus disc containing behind-the-scenes, interviews, commentary, bumpers, and more. I waited years to see this show again, and this did not disappoint. If you were a fan of the show, I most highly recommend this.",1336348800,7,384,4.923076923076923
5053816,5,B00746R3LM,"It's about time that this classic show had a proper video release. The picture quality is outstanding. Watch this series and you'll realize how bad most TV shows are these days.

5053817,5,B00746R3LM,"I was 5 and a half years old when I first saw this series...and remembered it was quite funny and clever...and when I saw the ad for the DVD, I was shocked to see it also starred John Astin, one of  my favorite actors of all time! ( I had remembered Marty as the greatest goofball of all time...well, either him or Bob Denver).  Well, I just received my DVD today, and the pilot episode was AMAZING...funny, full of all the old classic 60's sitcom stars, and just a joy. This is a great set...do yourself a favor and buy this treasure...My wife, who DIDN'T remember this series remarked about John Astin's acting...that he was wonderful, just like he was on the Addams family. That he didn't so much play Gomez, but that Gomez WAS John Astin!  And if you like the Addams Family, you have GOT to get this DVD set!

5053818,5,B00746R3LM,"UPDATE OCTOBER 23,2012 ON THE RELEASE OF THE SECOND HALF: I just spoke directly with Lightyear Entertainment, who answered my question on, when can we expect the release of the second half of this fabulous show I'm Dickens... He's Fenster? They told me they don't have a date as of yet, the reason being they have to sell more of this first half in order to generate enough money to do the prep work necessary to release the second half. So, I hope more people find out about this wonderful old show and buy it, so the wait will be shorter! It just wouldn't be the same without the second half, especially just to see the great ping pong tournament again! Let's keep our fingers crossed that sales pick up this Holiday Season and Thank You Lightyear for answering my question for us fans who have to have the second half of this GREAT show!

I'm Dickens...He's Fenster is one of the rarest and funniest one season sitcoms that hasn't been completely seen in 50 years. Although on rare occasion, a few of the episodes were shown on smaller networks by special request in a few cities, no broadcasting company would ever spend the money for syndication for a one season show with only 32 episodes. The most requested episode was Table Tennis, Anyone?, as it's genius comedy was rated as hilarious as the Lucy And The Chocolate Factory episode from I Love Lucy.

This is not the typical one season television show that was canceled because it was a flop. This hilarious 1962-1963 show was shown on ABC at 9:00 p.m. on Friday nights. It was up against the top rated NBC's Sing Along With Mitch and Route 66 on CBS. By the time the unbelievably high final ratings came in near the end of the season in 1963, ABC did not have the foresight to renew I'm Dickens...He's Fenster for another season and so this very funny show never saw a second season. Not renewing their contracts, left the cast and main characters of John Astin and Marty Ingels already signed on to other projects- John Astin signed on to The Addams Family.  By the end of this first and only season, I'm Dickens...He's Fenster not only beat out both Sing Along With Mitch and Route 66 in the ratings, but critics gave the show rave reviews from the NY Times,  The Hollywood Reporter and Time Magazine. This left the viewers back in 1963 truly disappointed in never seeing a second season of the two best friend carpenters played by Astin and Ingels.

This show was created, written, directed and produced by the fantastically talented Leonard Stern, who's other contributions to television include The Honeymooners, Sergeant Bilko, The Steve Allen Show, Get Smart, He And She and McMillan And Wife. While having his home remodeled in 1961, Stern couldn't believe the construction workers sealed a ladder inside his chimney and couldn't pass up writing a sitcom about such real life unbelievable hilarity. The show is about two young blue collar carpenters- Harry Dickens (Astin) and Arch Fenster (Ingels). Dickens is married to Kate played by Emmaline Henry and Fenster is a bachelor. The comedy surrounds Harry Dickens longing for an exciting life that best friend bachelor Arch Fenster enjoys with his little black book, which Harry's wife Kate would never allow, and their fellow workers  getting into hilarious predicaments on the job with their boss Mr. Bannister. Many guest stars got their television beginnings on this show, and some of the guest stars include Yvonne Craig (Batgirl), Lee Meriwether, Harvey Korman, Chris Korman (Harvey's son), Sally Kellerman, Ellen Burstyn, Edy Williams, Jim Nabors and more. It's going to be really great seeing these tv stars again in their television debuts, on this 30 minute black and white situation comedy.

This one season of I'm Dickens...He's Fenster is being sold in half sets by TV Time Machine Productions, which is a company owned by Lightyear Entertainment. Lightyear Entertainment bought out RCA Video Productions in 1987, who owned this show and many other old gems. TV Time Machine Productions said they have digitally restored these episodes to perfection for the show's 50th anniversary, and added many Bonuses. In this Volume 1 they will include Episodes 1-16; NEW interviews with John Astin, Marty Ingels, director Arthur Hiller, Creator Leonard Stern and others; Audio Commentary from John Astin, Marty Ingels, Yvonne Craig, Lee Meriwether, Chris Korman, Leonard Stern and others; 4 featurettes; a tribute to Leonard Stern; commercial bumpers; promos; cast commercial; thank you video and a 6 page booklet. They stated Volume 2- the second half with episodes 17- 32 will follow soon.

I can't wait till April 24th, 2012 to see those two wonderful carpenters Dickens and Fenster make me laugh again after not seeing them since 1962! They are just PERFECT together, like this over 10 hour bonus packed dvd set!

5053820,5,B00746R3LM,"This is an unjustly forgotten classic. Marty Ingels is a comedic genius worthy of Art Carney---in fact, there are many situations in the show that recall The Honeymooners. John Astin is also terrific. But much of the show really hinges on Emmaline Henry as Astin's wife. While loving. calm,  and understanding, she is also considerably smarter than her husband, whose foibles she must routinely forgive. She just rolls her eyes when he flirts openly and foolishly with other women. Emmaline Henry was an American actress of great beauty and subtle comedic talent--her facial expressions are often even funnier than the jokes! On one episode, we actually hear her sing, and it is strikingly beautiful. (Emmaline Henry started out as a big band vocalist.) The chemistry and timing among Ingels, Astin, and Henry is delightful. There are so many reasons to buy this DVD: it is superb American television, great comedy, great acting, and a rare chance to see the wonderful Emmaline Henry in a larger role than that of Mrs. Bellows on I Dream of Jeannie. (I wish there were more biographical information available on Henry.)",1433808000,,1119,5.016129032258065
5053821,5,B00746R3LM,"This was a great show.  I watched it as a child and am loving it again from this DVD.  However, I feel cheated that the second half of the series is missing.  Im still giving it a five star rating for the great talents of John Astin, Marty Ingels, the cast, writers and all the crew.  But please, do not deprive us of the second half of this classic, great comedy.",1432857600,,364,4.084507042253521
5053822,5,B00746R3LM,"I vaguely recall watching this in 2nd grade and then it vanished from the airwaves,  never to be seen again.  I picked up this DVD package to see what it was like, because I didn't remember anything from it, other than they were both carpenters.  I've seen lots of comedies over the years and a lot of them are just the same old shtick over and over again.  This series is fresh and original.  Every episode seems to have some really good gags that I've never seen before.  Very clever material.  I've watched 5 episodes so far and I'm not only looking forward to the rest in the package, but the next volume as well.  I hope there WILL BE a second volume.",1432166400,,656,4.276422764227642

5053829,4,B00746R3LM,"First I love John Astin. A true sit come wonder. He IS Gomaz!  Marty Ingles is great too. Perfect set up and most episodes are entertaining and true to the era. Very well written. My only comment is that the theme, and I love TV themes, part of the era as well, was not good. Painfullly bad. Who approved that was not thinking. Also it would have been nice to break away in some episodes to out door situations. The stage settings every episode comes across as a bit redundant and remind me of The Honeymooner's that is a great show, but feel that on site camera work (out of studio) would have added dimension to the show. Great premise, writing and production, it was just a little flat in delivery if you ask me. Even My Favorite Martian, the following year did outdoor sets. If you want to see Mr. Astin in his young greatness get this DVD. I really liked it!",1397260800,2,863,4.294478527607362
5053830,5,B00746R3LM,"One of the great screwball comedies in the history of television. I well remember being in Junior High School when ""I'm Dickens, He's Fenster"" premiered 52 years ago; to this day, it remains one of my all-time favorite programs. The prints are very high quality in original B&W, and Volume 1 consists of a 3-disc set which includes the first 16 episodes as well as comments by the stars, the producer, and one of the directors. My particular favorite episode, ""How Not to Succeed in Business"" is included in this volume, and it is even funnier than I remember! I recommend this treasure trove of comedy without reservation, and am really looking forward to acquiring Volume 2!",1394150400,,676,4.786324786324786
5053831,5,B00746R3LM,Great show. I'am surprised it did not continue into a longer run beyond this one and only season. John Astin and Marty Ingalls were great together in this. It's like watching it for the first time because it was done so long ago. I'am eagerly awaiting the rest of the episodes for the next release-please do release Vol. 2 soon!,1389571200,,328,4.483333333333333
5053832,5,B00746R3LM,"It is rare that a cast who are individually so brilliant can work together as an ensemble with equal brilliance.  This is truly as funny a show as I remembered it being.  As a big fan of Route 66 in those days, I missed many of these episodes on their first airing, but once I discovered the show, I was hooked--and then, all of a sudden, there weren't any more!

And now I feel I've been hung out to dry yet again, after only being able to see HALF of the one available season of the show, and the anticipated release of Volume 2 now being over a year past due.  As one reviewer wrote, ""They told me they don't have a date as of yet, the reason being they have to sell more of this first half in order to generate enough money to do the prep work necessary to release the second half.""  Does the entertainment industry really believe this circular reasoning themselves?  Do they not realize that customers don't like to get their hopes up by buying PART of something that may never be able to have in a complete form?  It's bad enough when giant outfits like Fox buy up, then sit on, an inventory of fine shows like WKRP and Newhart, and never let us have them all--but at least they do release ENTIRE SEASONS at a time, if or when they finally release them at all!

The astronomical term ""lightyear"" signifies a very long distance.  Too bad Lightyear, the company, only goes half the distance!  Half a season at a time was the very thing that suppressed sales of the Route 66 DVD releases.  I stopped playing the game of dribs and drabs by Season 3 and waited for somebody else to acquire the rights, then finally bought the whole show as a set.  That might or might not ever happen in this case, considering there was only the one season.  So my advice to other customers?  I rated this purchase 5 stars because the show itself is that good.  You'll probably be as glad you bought it as I am; but just be aware you could also end up feeling as frustrated as I do.  I seldom long for ""what might have been,"" but I do sometimes earnestly ache for what I know IS real and possible right now.

And my advice to the industry?  Stop being corporate weasels and COMMIT to your decisions.  Sure, you might misjudge once in a while, but you'll never experience big rewards either without enough commitment to follow through!",1384819200,4,2318,4.324074074074074

5053849,4,B00746R3LM,"When Amazon sent me an e-mail about recommendations that I might like,this show was listed. Since I had not heard of this series at all I disregarded it. A few days later while watching ""Leave it to Beaver"" this series was mentioned. Now with my curiosity piqued I decided to read the reviews, 8 at this time,on Amazon to see what it was all about. All reviews were favourable so I decided to buy this DVD.I'm glad to report that the reviewers were correct. This is a funny series about two carpenter friends and the comic situations they get into in the workplace and at home. Apart from the two lead characters, Dave Ketchum who plays another worker and Frank Devol who plays the boss, Mr Bannister,are excellent. Frank Devol was also a composer and composed the theme music  for shows like""My Three Sons""and""The Brady Bunch"".Also appearing as John Astin's wife in the show is Emmaline Henry who played Mrs Bellows on ""I Dream of Jeannie"".Some of the episodes on this DVD smacks of comic genius. Unfortunately,and this is the gyp, and why I gave it 4 stars, is because it is only the first 16 episodes. This is Volume One. Considering that this only lasted one season and is not well known you would think that they would release the whole series in one go. If nobody remembers this series why would they buy only half a season and then wait for the next to be released. On the plus side Disc 3 is full of bonus material and commentaries by the actors and actresses who were in the shows. Over three hours. So that kind of makes up for not being a whole season. Plenty of pratfalls and laughs with this show.",1351036800,6,1610,4.476190476190476

5053851,4,B00746R3LM,"I enjoyed this show when I was a kid and it is still enjoyable. I rate it 4 stars, however, because there are no English subtitles (actually there are no subtitles at all for any language). Being hearing impaired, I find this a big set back. My new TV does not allow me to watch close captioned as I do not have cable or satellite...so I don't even know if this DVD has closed captioned. Shame on this company...in this day & age, English subtitles should be a given.",1348012800,2,467,4.258426966292135

Believe it or not, I always wondered if that would ever come out on DVD and was thrilled to hear the news several months ago that, indeed, it had. The picture quality was fine also. WHY would ""they"" say something like ""vol. 2 SOON to follow"" .What does SOON mean? Two Months? Two Years? I watched Part 1 a few times and can`t wait for Volume 2. Any idea on the release date?

5053853,5,B00746R3LM,"Dickens and Fenster are like a hammer and nail, they work perfectly together to get the comedy job done.  I recalled snippets of this show from my youthful days of too much tv time.  I enjoyed it back then and was thrilled to see it on DVD, to be viewed 50 years later.  John Astin is the ""steady eddie"" and plays it quite well, both physically and in dialogue.  Marty Ingels plays his role as Arch with verve and panache, along with touches of unbridled craziness.  They both pull it off well together.  Emmaline Henry is delightful as Kate, and she brings a female comedic influence into the mix.  Frank DeVol is just ""off the wall"" with his low key portrayal as Bannister.  And don't forget the excellent, well known first rate sit-com supporting players such as Dave Ketchum, Henry Beckman, and Noam Pitlik.  Leonard Stern shines with his creation. On top of all these kudos, the theme music by Irving Szathmary is catchy and is still playing in my mind! All in all, this is one of the ""aces"" from the classic television days gone by.",1345075200,3,1038,4.508021390374331

5053855,3,B00746R3LM,"This release of a one season comedy from the early sixties has been lovingly packaged. You would think that this was comedy platinum. It isn't. It's a moderately amusing comedy with some great moments. The eye-opener is what a great comic Marty Ingalls was. This guy was super-talented and he steals every scene from John Astin and Emmaline Henry. It's a crime that he didn't get his own show. If you are looking for a fun forgotten show from the sixties, this will do fine. Don't expect some rediscovered brilliance, though. Some scenes just don't work and some of the humor seems obvious.",1343001600,10,590,4.737864077669903
5053856,5,B00746R3LM,"High praise for this wonderful show.
Astin and Ingels, and Emmaline Henry. Wow!! Great cast. This show was doomed to cancellation. The ABC network, how many times were they the ruination of a great show.
Get this volume 1 collection. Marty Ingels, who I knew very little about, is a great comedy actor - what timing --, and with Astin they are a great comedy team. Emmaline Henry of I Dream of Jeannie fame is so much more lovable and sweet in her characterization of Kate Dickens, John Astin's Screen Wife, just the opposite of Mrs. Bellows, she really shines in this role.
Not a stinker in the first 16 episodes and in a few I laughed/howled right out loud. Great writing and physical comedy. I can't wait for the final 16 episodes to be released in Volume 2.
John Astin has gone up a notch in my book, and Marty Ingels is now in my book, and I've added a couple of notches for him. And I got to know, a little better,  a few great character actors from this show such as David Ketchum, Noam Pitlik (gotta love that name), and Henry Beckman, who really is a scene stealer in the episodes I've seen him in so far. I normally think of, and recall, Mr. Beckman in the serious role, and not in comedic situations. He should have done more. He was Colonel Harrigan a few years later in McHale's Navy.

But the heart of the show is the chemistry between Ingels and Astin. As in the opening credits gotta switch off who gets first billing in my review.",1341964800,11,1447,4.3357933579335795
5053857,5,B00746R3LM,"Great Little pick Up by Lightyear Video. I hope they continue releasing old sitcoms from the 1960s, that ran for a short time and little known shows from the 1970s to the 1980s. I like them to hopefully release any of these, The Good Guys, It's About Time, Mickey, He & She, Grindl, Ensign O'Toole, Occasional Wife, The Pruitts of Southampton, Run, Buddy, Run, No Time for Sergeants, Wendy and Me, My Sister Eileen, C.P.O. Sharkey, The Tim Conway Show, Detective School, Carter Country, The Tortellis, Temperatures Rising, Mary (1985 TV series) Oh Madeline or Amanda's By the Sea. This DVD is very funny and really done well as a Comedy. This really needs promotion, because it is a kind of classic that people really do not know much about. This is what you call a real sitcom, you actually laugh, not like the shows on TV today. I never seen this show before as it was before my time, but the 1960s just had the best timeless comedy when it comes to slapstick or ensemble casting. People really need to get this show same as Car 54 Where Are you, no excuse. I just wish the Bilko (The Phil Silvers Show) complete series was available on DVD, that series has had the greatest lack of respect in DVD history, not being completed on DVD in the year 2012, CBS Paramount pull your finger out or give it to Lightyear.",1339545600,5,1313,4.475
5053858,5,B00746R3LM,"I'm Dickens, He's Fenster has more laughs in the pilot episode than most of today's TV shows have in a season. This comedy gem, created by Get Smart's Leonard Stern, is just flat-out brilliant. It's that classic comedy that lasts for generations - great characters, witty writing, and outstanding acting. The physical comedy is also a part of the show and Asting delivers it perfectly. I still don't understand why this show was canceled after one season as it's on a par with the great sitcoms of the time, like Dick Van Dyke and Get Smart. Any fan of classic comedy should check out this show.
The DVD package was also put together very well. The picture and sound quality is outstanding. There are some great extras and it's fascinating to hear from the actors and directors about the show. So many older shows have their DVD releases thrown together but not this one. You can tell a lot of care went into doing this the right way.
Highly recommended!",1339113600,3,954,4.617647058823529

8509644,5,B00746R3LM,"I remember watching this series during its original run, and how it was one of my favorite shows at the time. I'll admit that beyond remembering the basic premise, characters, and stars, I couldn't remember any details of the episodes or stories though. (Hey, it was a long time ago, and I was just a kid!) But because I remembered it as a favorite, I took a chance on the DVD set of the first half of its one and only season, hoping that it wouldn't disappoint me as have other old favorites I've watched again that haven't stood the test of time.

I wasn't disappointed. This was a terrific series with a cast chemistry and ensemble of supporting characters that would be the envy of any television show or movie. The show combined sight gags, physical comedy, and witty dialog in just the right balance which is probably a big reason the show I remember liking as a kid still works for me today as an adult.

It's a basic premise: two best friends who work together and practically live in each others pockets plus the wife of one of the buddies who loves her husband and understands how important his friend is to him. Plots range from work problems, dating, friendship, misunderstandings, and more. Basic ideas and concepts, but written and performed in such a way to make it entertaining and funny show after show.

One of my favorite things about the episodes included in this set is watching for actors who will go on to become stars on other shows or in films. For other eagle-eyed celebrity watchers, keep a lookout for Batgirl, Captain Clancy from ""Here Come the Brides,"" Barnaby Jones's daughter-in-law, and a future Oscar award winner for Best Actress (in her first television acting job) among others.

The third DVD of the set is all bonus features including several episode audio commentaries. All but one of the commentaries are worth the time, the exception being the one done by Lee Meriwether who had a bit part in one episode and really didn't have much to say. In contrast, Yvonne Craig's commentary track is a hoot with her enthusiasm and bubbly personality and pure enjoyment of watching the episode again along with the audience even though she too only had a bit part to discuss.

Other bonus clips include show bumpers, a cast commercial, and a number of interviews with the stars, producer, and on of the directors of the show.

Watch the episodes and then try to figure out how ABC went so wrong in canceling the show after only one season. If this show had stuck around for a few more years, it certainly would have been considered a classic of the sitcom genre of early television alongside shows such as ""I Love Lucy"" and ""The Honeymooners."" Instead it's taken almost a half-century for the show to get a chance at gaining a new audience's appreciation.

I'm waiting impatiently for Volume Two to be made available.

Highly recommended.",1470700800,2,2868,4.665346534653465
