5170396,1,B008N8A3JE,"I was so excited when I saw this available since I have been waiting for this for years!!  I received the first copy and the second disc would not work in any of my DVD players and appeared to be formatted incorrectly!  I requested a replacement since I really wanted a good copy of this and once again I was sent a defective copy. Perhaps that is why Amazon is not offering it except through other shippers now.  I have a feeling something went horribly wrong in producing these and the entire shipment was bad. If you order this item, please make sure that you immediately check Disc 2 on receiving it to see if it works. I still want this DVD, but not if it is defective. It is such a total pain to have to return something twice.",1357430400,14,733,4.2214285714285715

Perhaps I'm luckier than some others, in that both of the discs in my set play fine (in my computer -- I don't have a TV or a standalone DVD player).  If you like these, keep trying -- it's worth it!",1352851200,39,2061,4.7703081232493
5170400,1,B008N8A3JE,"I bought this item in a store. As the other reviews have said the second disc does not play. I tried playing the files on my computer directly (assuming there was an error with the menu), and they were corrupted. Pixelated, bad sound, skipping... there needs to be a re-issue. You will only get half of the episodes that you purchase.

update: I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement set which actually works... if you buy it now it should not be defective anymore. If you have a defective copy I recommend you ask for a replacement to be mailed to you.",1352592000,27,571,4.438095238095238
5170401,1,B008N8A3JE,"I have purchased Fractured Fairy Tales twice since its release date.  Both times, Disc 2 would not play regardless of whether I chose ""Play All"" or ""Episode Selection.""  After each purchase, I  had to request a refund which is a waste of my time and a waste of the retailer's resources.  What happened to quality control?  It is a disgrace Classic Media hasn't issued a recall of their defective product.  Apparently, Classic Media hopes you will purchase their defective junk and not watch the DVD until after the refund/return period has elapsed.  Shame on them.",1352332800,8,564,4.873684210526315

These cartoons are cartoons from my childhood, entertaining and funny, not like the cartoons today with so much violence. My nine year old granddaughter really enjoyed watching these cartoons!

Previous reviews talked about the defe Ctive second disc but I thought surely after 3+ years this issue would have been resolved. I was wrong. My only option on Amazon was to return it, not exchange it. I'm going to try one more time to get a working set because I enjoyed the working disc so much. Fingers crossed.

UPDATE: I repurchased it hoping the second dvd would work but I was wrong. Not going to try to get it again.",1463097600,3,499,4.308510638297872

It serves to first, instruct my students in childhood fairy tales that is part of their culture, and then, turn around and make fun of them. I had no problem with playback on the second disc. Hopefully, that is no longer a problem.",1458259200,3,336,3.9558823529411766

Nothing like it for parodies of stories and tales of childhood, done for adults with a sense of humor.  Back to back with Fractured Flickers and Beany & Cecil (and let's not forget Rocky & Bullwinkle).",1452556800,,353,4.645161290322581
5170413,2,B008N8A3JE,"I knew there were problems with the second disc a while ago after reading reviews, but since so many people were now leaving five star reviews, I thought it was safe to order this set. I was wrong. My set was from Fulfillment Express US and fulfilled by Amazon, so maybe the others received sets from another seller with good versions. First, the second DVD was loose in the box when I opened it, so it had scratches on it already. Regardless, that disc had the same problem many have already described - while the menu worked, none of the fairy tales would play. It would just skip back to the menu. So buyer beware - you might get a set that sounds like it is one of the good replacement ones OR you might get the old defective version. There is no way to tell. Also - First disc was fine. Everything played correctly.",1451606400,7,820,4.296774193548387

I sent an e-mail and received a reply that my message would be forwarded to the proper person.  I have heard nothing since.
