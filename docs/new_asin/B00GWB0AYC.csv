It's filmed in a workshop setting and I felt like i was right there learning alongside the other participants. The vid goes over the two hand swing, the snatch, long cycle and bonus- indian clubs. I loved the hows and whys. Why one person would swing with thumb forward as opposed to the rear( I was taught towards the rear but since I plan to compete in longcycle in the future I will use their tips!) Also the the hand insertion drill for the snatch! Priceless. Really. I still have a hard time with the snatch even though i learned from a really good teacher.  One of the reasons I was attracted to girevoy sport style of kettlebells is that the people who were doing the snatch seemed to flow like water. There seemed to be a flow to the people doing girevoy. I had to learn this style. I try to get as many resources as I can since I am primarily self taught with this style as opposed to hardstyle where I took lessons with an RKC. So if i see a dvd about kettlebell sport, I am buying it! I hope this style gets popular and hopefully dvd's like this will help introduce people to kettlebell sport.  My snatch on my right hand is now awesome(just on the first viewing!), gotta work on my left side but it will get there!!!!",1389830400,,1337,4.23921568627451
