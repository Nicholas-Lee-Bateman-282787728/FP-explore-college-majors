760718,5,6303962874,"I can remember seeing this movie at our theatre downtown during the summers.  Our local paper always had coupons we could turn in with a milk bottle cap and 25 cents to see movies while our moms shopped.  Safe at Home was one of my all-time favorites.  ""Roger Maris . . . Mickey Mantle . . . gosh . . . gee""  It's a wonderful movie of a time less difficult and harried.  My son, who's 22, is a huge Mantle fan and I can hardly wait for him to see the movie.",1123286400,,457,3.870967741935484
760719,4,6303962874,"This film really plays like an episode of ""Leave It To Beaver"" because of the situation little Bryan Russell gets himself into. He tells his friends that Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were his pals when he used to live in New York. Now living in Florida Russell has to figure a way to get over to see Mantle and Maris in spring training to save the day. William Frawley plays their New York Yankee's coach. Do they come to Russell's rescue or not? This is a good family film.",1022889600,3,475,4.288888888888889
760720,3,6303962874,"Maris and Mantle were the greatest ""one-two punch"" in sports history since Ruth and Gehrig (and they didn't have the alliteration!) when this picture was made. Around that time they made a cameo in the Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedy ""That Touch of Mink"" so this was a natural progression.
As you might expect, it's an incredibly sentimental, predictable movie about a little leaguer who sez he knows Maris & Mantle - you tell me the plot.
The nostalgia factor is high and never embarrassing; in fact, Roger and Mickey do a decent job in the acting department. Manager Ralph Houk is on hand but not in uniform - William Frawley plays ""The Coach"" and does okay, despite being a little too old for the role.",1005350400,,702,4.624
760721,4,6303962874,"Very enjoyable film with the flavor of family sitcoms of the era. I had a particular interest in this picture since my uncle (Joe Hickman) had a ""walk-on"" part as the grounds keeper. He was in fact, in charge of the grounds at the stadium in Ft. Lauderdale where The Yankees had Spring Training and where Safe at Home was filmed.",986688000,,329,4.409836065573771
760722,4,6303962874,"Caught this one on AMC recently and was glad to find it available on VHS from Amazon.com. A nostalgic, b&w, early 60s ""quickie"" released to cash in on Maris and Mantle's 1961 assault on the Babe's home  run record. It's got a lot going for it, too! A storyline right out of  Leave It to Beaver, a cute kid, a gruff coach played by professional grouch  Bill Frawley (Fred Mertz) and cameos by Whitey Ford and other Yankees from  that era. The real attraction though are the M&M Boys: Mantle and  Maris! Roger turns in his greatest screen appearance ever: his emotional  range runs from his normal surliness to outright contempt for the world.  Mantle, not to be upstaged, appears to be relatively sober in his scenes.  Also, since the movie is fiction, he doesn't charge fans for signing an  autograph! Safe at Home! was aimed, obviously, at boys 12-and-under. It's a  fun film that really brings back the feeling of being a card-collecting,  home run worshipping Yankee fan during the early years of Camelot.",948844800,14,1008,4.702857142857143
760723,3,6303962874,"This is a cute story about a little league baseball player who wants to be popular with the other youngsters on the team.  He tells them that he knows Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris and that they have agreed to come to their  basball banquet.  He doesn't know them and he is trapped in a lie.  To bail  himself out, he runs away from home and ends up at the Yankee training camp  in Florida in hopes of enlisting the help of the two super stars.  They  refuse him (They want him to fess up) and he is forced to tell the team the  truth.  Of course, the Mick and Rajah come to his rescue and invite the  team to their camp.  Wm. Fraley (I Love Lucy) seems out of place - Mickey  and Roger are stiff.  But, the film is cute and now that Mick and Roger are  gone, its a way to have some footage of them.",947030400,2,799,3.9371069182389937
760724,4,6303962874,"I saw this movie 1st run as a kid in the 60's and loved it.  35 years later I am still awe struck by Mantle and Maris.  This is definitely a kid's movie .  But it does bring back fond memories of a youth long since passed and of two larger than life heroes who somehow will remain forever young:  Mantle & Maris.  Play ball, guys!  END",896054400,5,335,3.925373134328358
760865,4,6303962874,"Definitely not for the quality of the movies, which is awful, but for the camp value.  Safe at Home is a must for anyone who rooted for (or against) those incredible Yankee teams of the late '50's/early '60's.  The acting isn't great, and the plot line is almost bizarre, but the idea of getting these guys into a movie is hysterical, and it's great to see Mickey and Roger again.  Kill the Ump is a waste of time, unless you loved Life of Reilly on tv.  William Bendix is no better as  an ump-hater than he was as Babe Ruth, but, again, good to see him.",1432771200,,554,4.188679245283019

760868,5,6303962874,"Safe At Home was so very great with the real Roger Maris and MIckey Mantle and the young boy who just had to see them.  The movie was from 1962 and it's a dream of another era when it was a game and there were heroes; it was not the dreadful big business it is now and I was only 8 yrs. old then and now I'm 60, it just brings a magic to see them and Ft. Lauderdale as it was then!!!",1426723200,,383,3.6144578313253013

760873,3,6303962874,"I bought this for ""Kill the Umpire"" and was not disappointed.  It's an old childhood favorite of mine and has lost a little of it's polish for me over the years but was still enjoyable to watch.  It's about a fan who really knows his baseball but hates umpires.  Of course, he ends up becoming one and we see some of the reasons for the umpire in the game.  Nice story.",1401062400,,369,4.154929577464789

760937,3,6303962874,Kill the Umpire with William Bendix is pure joy to watch.  It is dated but fun to see again.  To see the gear umpire had to wear in the fifties will make you appreaciate umpires a little more.,1381104000,,192,4.026315789473684
760938,5,6303962874,Rare movie where baseball icons of the 60s play themselves. Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris and shots of Fort Lauderdale spring training...many years ago. Priceless. There is a great story line in the movie about a boy who told a tall tale and how things get a bit out of control afterwards. Highly rate this movie for baseball fans and parents who like a G-rated movie that has a positive message about being truthful and honest for the children.,1376006400,5,445,4.6455696202531644
760939,5,6303962874,A brilliant comedy from the good old days. The quality of the dvd is excellent and even our children loved it,1375747200,,109,4.238095238095238

760941,5,6303962874,William Bendix does a great job as an irate fan who thinks umpires are always wrong - until he finds himself on the other foot. Safe at Home is merely a chance to see Mantle and Maris in their prime.,1369267200,,199,4.0

760994,5,6303962874,I bought this as a Father's Day gift for my Dad.  He remembered enough of the movie to allow me to buy it for him thru Amazon.  We watched Kill the Umpire together and laughed a lot.  They don't make movies like that any more.,1346457600,,226,3.977777777777778

761000,4,6303962874,"While this is an older film now, it's still funny. And it's not just a comedy, it's also a film about doing the right thing.
This is a film about former ball player having a hard time holding job outside of baseball. Every spring he loses his job because he can't stay away from the game. His wife puts her foot down and his father-in-law winds up helping find a job he can keep, and do well at.
 William Bendix was great in this film and the man he was to later star with on The Life of Riley; Tom D'Andrea (who played his neighbor Gillis in that series) showed that could do good work together.
Not for someone looking for a faithful representation of the game, but if you're looking for fun film about the national pass time this is a good one.",1239235200,,747,4.1875
761001,4,6303962874,"""Kill The Umpire"" is a really a funny movie, something Director Lloyd Bacon produced by the carload back in ""the classic era."" Bacon's movies were fast-moving and entertaining, and this was no exception. If you liked William Bendix in his mid-1950s TV show, ""Life Of Riley,"" you'll like this film. He plays the same type of guy.

Whether you enjoy baseball or, you'll get a lot of laughs out of it, too. It's just simply a goofy and likable comedy, filled with the kind of characters you'd see in a late '40s/early '50s comedy. What's nice about the older films, too, is that you actually see whole families: dad, mom and a couple of kids.

Actually, you more you know about baseball, the more you'll just shake your in disbelief at some of the things you'll see in this story because they could never happen today, or even back in 1950. (i.e. a fan coming out of the stands and punching an umpire several times over the course of a minute, and then ump slugging him....and nobody arrested?)

Anyway, Bendix is very good and the supporting case, led by underrated actor Tom D'Andrea, is fun to watch, too.

This film also will remind older film buffs of silent movie comedies with a wild scene at the end you have to see to believe. (Hint: Bendix winds up ""water skiing down city streets, being pulled by an ambulance).

The second half of this twin-bill DVD, ""Safe At Home,"" is so bad it's not even worth discussing. Suffice to say that even die-hard Yankees fans can't praise this clunker which stars real-life heroes Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris.",1236124800,,1550,4.601449275362318
761087,3,6303962874,"I watched this with my four boys who are all big baseball fans.  It reminded me of an episode of Flipper and I found it about as interesting.  I did like the talk Mantle and Maris gave the boy about responsibility.  My 10 and 12 year old boys thought ""it was ok"" ""little bit interested in some part, but not the best movie"" ""It was neat they had Mantle and Maris.  I did not know they did any movies.""  My 7 and 9 year old boys both liked it an said, ""It was a really cool movie.""  For the price it might be worth picking up for an evenings entertainment.  Just don't expect to much.",1224806400,,583,4.017391304347826
761088,3,6303962874,"As a big Yankee fan I enjoyed seeing this movie, but it was not beautifully scripted and the acting and dialog were not very good.  It was clearly done for publicity after great success they had in 1961.

Don't watch it if you can't stand bad acting and poor scripts.",1207440000,38,267,4.32
761089,3,6303962874,"I have the fondest memories of this movie from my youth.  Whenever I found I was repeating myself for whatever reason, it was hard not to have a fleeting thought of William Bendix as Bill ""Two Call"" Johnson.  So, finally, I had to see it again on DVD.

I enjoyed seeing the movie again, but not while I watched it.  One problem is that the memories planted when we are younger don't get reassessed from an adult perspective as we age. The histrionics and sight gags that seemed so appropriate to a 12 year old now seem way over-the-top and interfere.

While I was watching the movie, my thought was, ""What did I ever see in this?""  But, a few days later, the memories of that happy 12 year old are blended with renewed memories of the details of the script and, once again, I get that warm glow thinking about it.",1207353600,3,813,4.315789473684211
761090,5,6303962874,"If you thought Adam Sandler sports comedies were funny you should check this one out. William Bendix plays a Joe Lunchpail-type who cuts work compulsively to go to baseball games, getting fired from every job he has.
His retired umpire father-in-law talks him into enrolling into Umpire School where his loudmouth opinion about baseball gets put to the test. Every guy in this movie is doughy (not a waistline under 50"" is to be seen) and all the women look like cheesecake models. It's VERY cartoony stuff and very, very funny. I loved it.
I also want to give a shout-out to William Bendix, who started out playing menacing heavies for years and then moved over to comedy and played them just as well. What an outstanding actor.",1197763200,5,729,4.703125
761091,4,6303962874,"When the rat race of modern life gets to you there is always timeless baseball. Unfortunately the modern world has found a way to corrupt the purity of the game. These two movies harken back to the older "" purer "" days. Yes the movies are dated and abit corny but the values still ring true.",1180396800,,291,4.214285714285714
761092,5,6303962874,"Kill The Umpire is one of William Bendix's best performances, right up there with Life Of Riley. This is a great baseball movie from the other side of the game, the umpire's point of view.

Safe At Home is a great piece of nostalgia for baby boomers. Mantle, Maris, and the rest of the Yankees at their height! What's not to like?",1179100800,5,330,4.32258064516129
761093,4,6303962874,"Although ""Kill the Umpire"" is a great Bendix classic, ""Safe at Home"" is more like a documentary or short that would be included with a good movie instead of billed as a double feature.
