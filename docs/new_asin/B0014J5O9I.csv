8255870,5,B0014J5O9I,Very difficult workout.  I run marathons and do triathlons.  This workout made me ache for days after the first time I did it.  It is now a regular workout in my training regimen.,1386633600,,179,4.363636363636363
8255871,5,B0014J5O9I,"Steve Maxwell work along DVD's are some of the best stuff I have seen out there. His workouts are challenging and a great buy for anyone involved in martial arts, LEO, or military. You will see a plethora of movements in here for strength and endurance.

If you are a girly-man he has some progressive alternate movements you can practice until you are ready for the big 300 workout as performed by Steve Maxwell himself.",1355529600,,421,4.613333333333333
8255872,5,B0014J5O9I,I love this workout. I will buy all of Steve's stuff now. Check out his website to see all he offers.,1333929600,,101,3.857142857142857
8255873,1,B0014J5O9I,"What a HUGE disappointment this DVD was. It was like an amateur film, totally unscripted and there was no choreography. This was a MASSIVE waste of $$$ DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PIECE OF JUNK.",1295049600,,187,4.529411764705882
8255874,5,B0014J5O9I,"After 20 plus years of working out I have still learnt alot from this DVD - some variations that I have never seen of classic full bodyweight movements.

The workout ""300"" is guaranteed to push even the fitest of the fit and if just starting out the Level 1 & 2 (aka Basic and intermediate)are good introductions with sensible goals.

Keep pushing for better times as instructed and you will only make progress.

Be sure to have a chinning bar of some type and something to complete bodyweight rows off to hand and a big bottle of water and a towel!!!.

**U.K buyers be aware** - Just a shame that when shipping to the U.K I was charge twice for shipping (ordered the kettlebell 300 at the same time) and was then charged an extra 17.51 when they got to U.K and as a result of customs took 28 days in total to arrive.",1293580800,2,817,4.285714285714286
8255875,4,B0014J5O9I,"Okay, There is some talk about how this isn't the ""300 Workout"" used for the movie.... don't care! This is an excellent workout for guys who are tired of the more feminine tendency of most workout videos. This is also a good video for progress from weak to fit. Many of the exercises he uses in the video are exercises I used in the US Army and a couple I know the Salvadorian military uses. Another thing I liked was no music. Ever have a workout video with music you hate and it gets stuck in your head while you are in traffic and soon you find a judge is expecting an explanation for why you assaulted 3 cops? Well with this video, put whatever music on you want and get to work. Lastly, it is so much a go at your own pace with end goal of doing the full advance workout in 45 minutes that almost anyone can benefit from it [except for the ultra fit types, you know who you are]. To give you an idea, Steve Maxwell struggles with his own workout. You don't hear any chatter about ""I love it"" or ""Your butt is going to look so good."" Steve just comes off as a grumpy old man who challenges you to do better than a grumpy old man [him] with his workout.

Downside is Steve Maxwell is kind of creepy. You can tell he is a fighter and not a public speaker or entertainer. I have this expectation that he is going to show up at my door and start yelling at me for not keeping my elbows in. On top of that, he seems to have a hard time reading his cue cards or is trying to remember what he had pre written but is a little punch drunk or maybe he is just winging it. So he comes off as listening to Mike Tyson after a fight.
The workout is a little dependent on workout equipment. You have the variable pull-up bar, the half yoga ball, some mats and a yoga block to start off with. He mentions some stuff you can use to replace the equipment but even the door hang pull up bars are not a match for some of this workout. Kind of hate that.

Lastly, bad if you have a set time dedicated to working out and doesn't give a day to day breakdown on rest periods which is needed for this workout so your muscles can rest. You just try to do 30 reps of each exercise until you are done in as short a time as possible. My recommendation to start out with is a 30/10 reps alternate on exercises depending on if it is an upper body or lower body day until 30 feels as natural as breathing. Then do everything as 30 reps. Move up to the next level when that is second nature. Another option is to alternate this video with a different workout video that you like but find easy. I do the Forza workout as the cool down after 300 and do as my rest day workout when I feel like I need to take a break.

In thinking about it, I wonder if there is a Spartan diet plan? Lots of olives and red wine I hope.

8255876,5,B0014J5O9I,"Funnily enough as I write, I am watching my husband partake in the exercises from this DVD.
He was in search of a fully body workout programme, that was cheap but would challenge him.............it was cheap (considering the cost of a gym membership)is definitely challenging him and he already feel the benefit of a couple of workouts. It looks a relatively easy workout but I can assure you this isn't for the faint hearted!  Instead of his proclaimation of being a Gladiator........he says he is now going for Spartan status!  Watch this space?",1237420800,,547,4.870967741935484
