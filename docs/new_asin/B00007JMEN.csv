7976849,5,B00007JMEN,replacement for a faulty DVD I had. Great buy.,1512950400,,46,4.222222222222222
7976850,4,B00007JMEN,"Sharon Mann is a good instructor and this DVD has so much variety you may never get bored. To do this workout you either let Mann select your workout or you customize it to suit your current needs. You pick one warm up segment, one Workout 1 segment, one Workout 2 segment and then finally a cool down segment. These are all ready to go on the next screen. You push play and away you go.

Some of the issues I had with this DVD include not having enough time to get prepared for each segment. Often when the next one starts playing Sharon Mann is in the middle of an exercise or has already started. At the end of some of the programs there is a sort of fade out with a darkened set and then people doing exercises while the scene closes.

To combat these issues it is best to watch 25 minutes of the workout to see what is expected. For some of the workouts you need a step, a mat, a large exercise ball and stretchy bands. Having everything handy will help you start the exercise segments as fast as possible. But otherwise the instructor is very positive and seems to know what she is doing.

7976852,1,B00007JMEN,"A couple years ago I bought her complete box set from my local video store. I LOVED her workouts! I never got bored and I reached my target weight in only 5 months. It was great for the winter months. However, after a couple years of use, 2 of the 3 CDs got scratched so I reordered them from Amazon.
However, the since the time I bought them, they have redone the cover design and it is evident also the quality of reproduction for the CD has been compromised. The new versions don't work properly in my dvd player. I even went out and bought a new dvd player after Amazon shipped me a second set of videos which didn't work. The problem didn't go away. Basically, they either don't read, or when they do read in the player, the menu doesn't work right or the video skipps. Very dissapointing since I actually looked forward to working out with her.",1124668800,4,850,4.31875
7976853,5,B00007JMEN,"Wow, this DVD is a must have for anyone who is serious about getting into shape.  It offers a varied selection of workouts programmable by YOU. You decide which type of warm-up, workout and cool down to do.  This makes it very easy to alter each workout to work more cardio, or more lower body or ....you know where you need the most work, and this DVD lets you decide how and where to work it most.  Some of the workouts use freeweights, some are kickboxing, pilates, some all over training.  I love the flexibility to change workouts, in one DVD instead of 6 or 7 different ones with one workout each to accomplish the same thing.  I have used it for 2 weeks, and already lost 4 pounds and my clothes are fitting loosely.  I can not believe how fast I started seeing a change in my body shape.  I sound like one of those silly commercials, but I am serious, it is working for me and much faster than I would have thought.  I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to get aerobic training, and improve overall body condition.",1075680000,5,1031,4.333333333333333
7976854,1,B00007JMEN,"I purchased not one but two separate copies of the DVD.  When the DVD is inserted a caption reads ""input code, parental violation"".  Huh?
Both DVDs created the same problem for my late-model GE digital DVD.  Called the distributor.  Waste of time, they blamed my player.  Yikes!",1068940800,6,278,4.829787234042553
7976855,4,B00007JMEN,"While I do agree with what the first reviewer said,I think that's why I liked this dvd. I'm not a big Yoga fan-I have trouble relaxing and ""going with the flow of breath and movement"" -whatever! So while I too think Sharon is best at aerobics I liked the non-boring faster pace of the Pilates and Yoga-esque movements in this dvd. I liked the Stability ball parts eventhough Sharon didn't seem to have perfect balance-then again she's only human.
  Overall I think this a good dvd-the option to program your workout is my favorite aspect-I will be buying the other dvds in this series.",1050105600,3,585,4.615384615384615
