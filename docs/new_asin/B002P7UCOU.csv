The poses, background, music and instruction sets this DVD apart from all the rest. You will find modifications to all the poses for each level, and it's easy to turn the music on or off during your routines. I also use this DVD for meditation practice --Christine will help you to dive into a new world of relaxation! http://www.diveintoyoga.com/diveintoyoga.com/Dive_into_Yoga_DVD.html",1369180800,,561,5.108695652173913
