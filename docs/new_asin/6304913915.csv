8739042,5,6304913915,"After years of waiting, I finally achieved my dream of being one of the few, and fortunate, to have actually seen this cinematic masterpiece.  It was well worth the wait.  Although there didn't seem to be any mention of  the Holocaust in the movie, it sure had a lot of vampires.  Walter  Stewart's performance was indeed stunning, and I can't wait till his next  film comes out.",950140800,2,379,4.582089552238806
