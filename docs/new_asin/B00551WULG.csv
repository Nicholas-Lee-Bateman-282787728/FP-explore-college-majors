Tall, face wrapped up. Will a man in the crowd be accused? The victims all have golden hair. Newspapers rush the news to the public. [Why are people interested in the misfortunes of others] Why does it happen on a Tuesday? There is a show Golden Curls where dancers wear blonde wigs. One works as a clothes model. [The story goes on. Its hard to follow without a sound track or subtitles. Unless you can read lips.] At night police patrol the streets. A man leaves his lodgings. Then a woman screams! Men hear this. There is another body. A landlady inspects the rooms of a tenant. The newspapers report another murder.

A noise from an upstairs room attracts attention. What were you doing to Daisy? Get out says the man. Dont leave Daisy alone with him says her mother. The police plot the killings, the next one should be near these lodging houses. Daisy tells about a gift from where she works as a model. Send it back says her father, its a present from a stranger. Daisy bathes. She doesnt worry about going out with that lodger. Her boyfriend objects. Take me home please. Detectives arrive to search the lodgers rooms, they have a warrant. They find a black bag in a locked drawer! There is a pistol inside. And a map and newspaper clippings about the murders. There is picture of a murdered woman. Next an arrest. Is this the end? We learn more about his past. The police detective telephones to learn surprising news! A mob catches up to him. Can he be saved in time? Will there be a happy ending for Daisy?

The video quality of this 1926 film is poor. The few titles makes it hard to follow the story. How closely did it match the novel from which it was adapted? Alfred Hitchcock would do better in the rest of his long career. Many of his stories involved a man who was wrongfully accused of a crime (so too other movies), or a man who has a secret that he must hide from everyone. They are variations of the classic murder mystery. Did they ever make a talking version of this movie? This novel is now hard to find. How many other movies are based on true crimes? The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Valley of Fear are classic examples.",1473638400,,2365,4.382687927107061

I don't have this particular DVD but I do have 2 other different DVDs of this old classic Hitchcock movie. I adore this movie and have watched it a number of times. There are varying versions partly because some seem to contain more material. There is also a later version starring Novello, an early talkie, called the Phantom Fiend, which has a great deal of charm though is not quite as good. However, PF does allow us to see the great man (Novello) playing piano, a joy for those of us who love his music but of course never had the chance to see him play.

I don't know how much Novello is known in the USA. Probably very little. But in UK and France in particular he was a huge star - a top movie star of silents, a top stage star, writing many plays he then usually starred in, and of course and his musical creations are divine, especially the operettas from Glamorous Night to King's Rhapsody. In the latter he played the King, and died suddenly, far too young, of a heart attack the same evening after what proved to be his last performance. Greatly mourned, never forgotten.

Hitchcock was I expect required to use heart-throb Novello for this part. I doubt this beautiful and romantic matinee idol Ivor Novello was quite what Hitchcock would have liked but it was early days for Hitchcock. So Hitchcock couldn't use the ending that is in the original book and has been used in some later movie versions. No matter, the movie is beautifully made with some classic moments such as when the door is opened of the house where he is to lodge, and he appears in a background of the creepy London fog that's greatly a feature of the story.

Along with the story that we today can understand, there are images and issues that people of the time would recognise and bond with that we need to know about to comprehend the movie fully. It was 1926, not very long after the War to end all Wars, and there were still sad damaged ex-soldiers giving poignant images then, and remembrances of miserable wartime scenes such as hospitalisation and damaged personalities. Hitchcock weaves in images of this type that enhance the drama of the Lodger's mission, his plight, the fears of those who believe he is the serial killer loose in London who is murdering attractive fair-haired girls and the reactions of fearful and angry ordinary people when they decide the Novello character is indeed the killer.

It's useful to know that the very white faces of the actors look like this because white makeup was necessary in those days for a b/w movie, otherwise the actors' faces looked dirty.

One of my favourite scenes is when Novello and the landlord's daughter are playing chess, and Novello warily tries to show her he's interested in her. A classic scene from the movie, very sweet, very poignant.

The ending had to be made happy for the ""hero"" and his girl, even though in the original book you never know for sure if the Lodger is the killer, or not, though it seems very likely he is. In the movie, they wouldn't allow Novello to turn out a murderer even though I'm sure he'd have loved to be challenged with a more ambiguous part.

It's well worth reading the splendid and exciting book, whether before or after seeing the movie.

The Phantom Fiend is best watched after one's seen and read The Lodger, otherwise it doesn't make a lot of sense. It was clearly a vehicle for an early Novello talkie. He never did much more in talkies, even though his beautiful voice came over so well, but instead concentrated on stage from then on. The only PF version I've managed to find ends very abruptly without seeming to finish the story, so I assume the end has been lost though this is not stated. In this version, again Novello is not the murderer, this time he's ""foreign"", and he has a demented brother who looks just like him.

The other Novello movies well worth seeing are ""The Rat"" trilogy. Set in Paris, these are immense fun. Well, anything of his is worth seeing, even the curious Downhill, in which Novello in his 30's plays a teenage schoolboy for the start of the movie! He is so handsome and youthful looking that he gets away with it!!!",1310515200,7,4199,4.542328042328043
