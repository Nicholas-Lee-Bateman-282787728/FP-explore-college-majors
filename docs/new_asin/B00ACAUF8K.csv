I don't speak Korean and someone asked if the subtitles were good.  We understood the subtitles and understood the story.

If you like Gong Yoo you might love this one.  Lee min Jung, Shin Won Ho, Suzy, Jang Hee Jin were all fun too.",1498003200,,441,4.178571428571429

8549969,3,B00ACAUF8K,"With a little work, it could have been a 5 star drama. The story was such a neat idea! The execution went from good to boring, to good to boring, boring, then good, that ended unsatisfactorily. Dragging out repetitive scenes and dialogue when they could have developed the time in Germany with the new family relationships and the chasing and courting toward the end of the drama, with the main couple. I'm not sure what the writers and directors were thinking. It was if their imagination went out the window and they were trying to fill in space.  It got old fast. As the audience, I felt tired and aggravated, waiting for something to happen. The acting was good. It was nice seeing Gong Yoo (Dr. Seo Yoon Jae) from the Coffee Prince. Lee Min Jung who played Da Ra, was so good at playing a stupid twit, that it was annoying. I hate it when women are portrayed that way. However, if you like watching brainless idiots, then you'll probably like it. The other unnecessary dialogue was using Jesus' name in vain, as an expletive, several times in the drama. So disrespectful to someone who gave and suffered so much. What a turn-off!",1375833600,,1134,4.5588235294117645

This is a strange and very complicated story of two brothers who are almost 10 years apart and who do not know of each other.  After they are involved in the same car wreck - their consciousnesses are switched, so that the the younger brother (a teenager), who has fallen in love with his school teacher, who is engaged to his older brother(Gong Yoo's character), is now in his older brother's (Gong Yoo's) body; meanwhile his body is in a coma.  Confusing?  The female lead and love interrest is Da Ran (Lee Min Jung).  A further complication is the teenage brother's girl friend who arrives in Korea to visit her boy friend.  And, then there are the boys parents.  Does this all sound like a soap opera?  This TV show is at least as traumatic and dramatic, with plots twists and surprises, and with as much emotion and as many emotions as possible.
Gong Yoo, who was great in Coffee Prince, is a great actor, and he can pull it off.
Great music, the sound track is wonderful.
The ending however is somewhat abrupt and ambiguous.  After their consciousnesses have returned to their rightful bodies and the brothers don't remember what has happened during the several months (Da Ran remembers) - who will be with whom?  Will their love survive?
It is a great show!",1355702400,,1759,4.578274760383387
