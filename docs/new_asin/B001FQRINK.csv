All of the performances are deeply moving and it's wonderful to see peoples from so many cultures and backgrounds sharing their inmost longings, praises and deep devotion. Would that all humankind were as welling to sit down and worship together!!!",1363305600,,365,5.421052631578948
8302344,5,B001FQRINK,"I watched this beautiful, diverse musical tribute to the premise that music really does connect all of us to each other on Free Speech TV. It transports one from the pettiness of our present political and economical dilemmas - a transport of spirit sorely needed by all humans in their effort for survival of their physical selves, as well as their mental being, i.e., their souls. For a world music lover, it is undescribably fantastic. ENJOY!~",1307491200,,445,4.868421052631579
