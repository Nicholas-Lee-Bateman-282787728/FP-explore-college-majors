8466918,5,B005DJ0MZ6,"Another gem of a DVD from the Abraham-Hicks workshops. Both informative and uplifting, and we shared it with various friends.",1364601600,,125,5.3
8466919,5,B005DJ0MZ6,"Abraham teaches us how to stay in the Vortex and many teaching are related how to change the way of thinking. One expression that was used about unconditional love, was a shocking revelation for me and probably everyone else was ""I love you so much that I don't care what you think"". The explanation following it was convincing as usual. Thanks Abraham.",1307318400,4,353,4.709677419354839
8466920,5,B005DJ0MZ6,Anraham keeps on making it easy to get into vibrational alignment. Every DVD will speak to you on some level even the ones you don't think will.,1305072000,3,144,4.37037037037037
8466921,5,B005DJ0MZ6,"This DVD is not as long as many of the other Abe DVD material and I would have liked to see Abraham spend time discussing some of the other processes in addition to what was on the disk. I especially enjoyed the Focus Wheel Segment and I could watch that everyday as it is such a wonderful and POWERFUL example of doing a focus wheel and I really felt it and ""got it"" after watching Abe speak. Really good stuff. I wish there was some discussion & expansion on the Check Book Process - I know Abraham has talked about it on the CDs. Overall happy I added this to my Abraham Hicks Library.",1299974400,10,588,4.166666666666667
