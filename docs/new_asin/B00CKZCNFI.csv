It is good but would have like more choice.

Super fun, super effective way to MELT THE POUNDS OFF!.

5 big stars!",1400112000,2,135,4.826086956521739
8582884,1,B00CKZCNFI,"Grab a friends digital camera and film her on an elliptical, that is what this DVD is.  Low production value and just watching her on her elliptical the whole time from the same angle.  Terrible music.  An Amazon-burned DVD.  Really?!  Nothing wrong with the lady, her work out and what she says, but any workout video requires more flexibility and more motivation.  Of course you cannot return an open DVD, so felt it was my duty to warn.",1386892800,2,439,4.564102564102564
8582885,4,B00CKZCNFI,"I have a zillion spinning DVDs for my spin bike but had been unable to find anything equivalent for my elliptical trainer.
This is the first (and as far as I know the only) workout DVD made especially for the elliptical trainer.
It follows a similar pattern as the typical spinning DVD with a nice warm up, interval training, and cool down.
As with spinning DVD workouts, you can control the intensity of your workout by increasing the tension or the the incline.
Overall I liked it as a change of pace and knowing that I can still use it as my fitness improves by adjusting the tension and incline.
I would like to see more workouts along this line for elliptical trainers.",1381190400,3,674,4.487804878048781
