8635167,3,B00HRY3HM0,I like the movie it's one of my favorites I'm just upset about the fact that it said it had special features and a documentary featuring Meek Millz which it doesn't that's why the rating is only 3 stars. Oh well such is life. You can't have everything.,1525046400,,252,4.270833333333333

8635170,4,B00HRY3HM0,"Recently divorced  Monica Gordon moves from Harrisburg to Philadelphia  which is a lot like Harrisburg without the cows.  Her teen daughter Nicole (Nafessa Williams) makes friends with girls who date gang members and becomes privy to a murder her mom is prosecuting.  The film incorporates rap/hip-hop which rhymes Rocky with cocky and use the word ""Philadelphia"" a lot.  Nicole falls in love with Mike (Marvin Warner) whose brother was the first victim.

The story is told in eight 10-12 minute chapters from BET rated TV-14. The bad language cut out with far too many awkward silent moments, although there are times when you get a partial f-bomb.  The story held my interest, the acting being acceptable for TV viewing.

Like most TV films, the story doesn't go too deep.",1447113600,2,774,4.945736434108527
