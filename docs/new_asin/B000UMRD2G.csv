8213875,4,B000UMRD2G,"This mini-series is the pilot for one of Food Network's most successful shows. Battle of the Masters is a more worthy successor to Fuji TV's Iron Chef legacy than the first attempt by UPN featuring William Shatner.

Iron Chef fans should be aware: this is pretty much the only official ""Iron Chef""-related material you are likely to see on DVD, since Fuji TV doesn't seem to be in a hurry to release the originals.

This collection is notable in that it tracks the transformation of two Iron Chefs.  It introduces the IC persona of Mario Batali, who was previously famous for Molto Mario and other Food Network cooking shows.  And it shows the transformation of the last Iron Chef Japanese, Masaharu Morimoto, as his physical appearance moves from the silver-clad sushi chef of the original to the pony-tailed exotica master of Iron Chef America.  It also introduces a ""what if"" scenario: not many people these days could say that Wolfgang Puck is an Iron Chef (there are only 12 people in the world who can officially claim this distinction), and it's intriguing to think what happened if Puck had agreed to stay with the series.

There are, of course, a few problems with this disc.  The ""Making Of"" TV special has been given a re-editing to remove material dealing with Iron Chef's original chairman, Takeshi Kaga, no doubt due to appearance rights issues, and the edits are somewhat jarring.  And while the promotional materials are a nice inclusion, you get the impression that some opportunities have been missed.  Some of the dishes, for example, look to be easrily replicable at home, and so a recipes extra would be in order.

Still, it's a worthy purchase, and a great gift for the foodie on your Christmas list.",1197331200,12,1722,4.787162162162162
