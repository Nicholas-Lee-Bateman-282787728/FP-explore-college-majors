Wherever you go with this goofy, but fun family, you are in for one hilarious time. Spreading their own kind of love and joy, taking out Stonehenge, Hoover Dam, Aunt Edna's dog, a few cars, the neighbor's house, Wayne Newton's living room, and basically all of Europe along the way. Clark, Ellen, Rusty, and Audrey know how to show you family style vacations, and will have you laughing out loud every step of the way.

Chevy Chase is the definitive easy going Dad, trying to make memories with his family. It's not his fault if nothing ever goes right...is it? Beverly D'Angelo is always wonderful as his loving wife, always at ""Sparky's"" side, and is as beautiful in ""Vegas Vacation"" as she was in ""Vacation"", shot 16 years apart. The kids, played by different actors in each(Anthony Michael Hall, and Juliette Lewis among them), are always fabulous, the way they know how to handle Mom and Dad, and create their own mischief as well. There's always a great sprinkling of legendary guest stars in each film as well. Imogene Coca, John Candy. Eric Idle, Wayne Newton, Sid Caser, Eddie Bracken, E.G. Marshall, and Wallace Shawn just to name a few. And how fortunate we are to be able to see an act with Siegfried and Roy preserved on film. Christy Brinkley adds her charms to the fun, and then of course, lest we forget ""Cousin Eddie"", could we ever even think of anyone but Randy Quaid in that role?

It's great to have them all together in a package deal (You KNOW you gotta have em all).

So have some fun Lampoon style, have lunch with Cousin Eddie, and tour the world with the Griswolds. 5 stars to Warner Bros for putting together this package for fans of these classics!
I laugh just thinking about them...enjoy, and Happy Trails ....Laurie",1149897600,,1875,4.672727272727273
7913654,4,B00000JWUU,"the first is always the best.  ""Vacation"" is one of the funniest movies of all times.  ""Christmas Vacation"" is just as funny as the first.  laugh after laugh, and constant griswald moments will leave chevy fans wanting more.  However, Vacation fans should stay clear of the latest ""vagas vacation"", which is not one of chase's best movies",1027123200,4,338,4.87719298245614
7913655,4,B00000JWUU,"Here we go agin with a movie that is so funny that you start crying. Directed by Amy Heckerling [ clueless, johnny dangerously] this movie focuses on the griswolds who have just won a trip to europe. Uses most of the humor of the first, some critics said that Heckerling stole the original script and write up, but she then made Johnny Dangerously which was a box office bomb, so they forgot about her. Sadly Dana Hill who plays Audrey died not to long ago.",975196800,,457,4.3882352941176475
