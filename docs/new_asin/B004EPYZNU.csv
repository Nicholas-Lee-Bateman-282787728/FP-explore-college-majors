4338178,2,B004EPYZNU,"If I were Jane Austen, I would sue.  This movie is BEYOND boring and quite frankly, a waste of the $3.99 I spent to watch it.  I lacks depth and fails to give much insight into the cultures and society it attempts to portray.  It's a superficial glance at the worlds of Mexican-Americans, corporate lawyers, romance, and just people in general.  I urge you to save your hard-earned $$$.",1305072000,9,386,4.550724637681159
4338179,5,B004EPYZNU,I first saw it at the movies and I loved it! I knew it was a movie I could watch over and over again. I just ordered it last week from Amazon and I can't wait to get it. It's also a pretty clean movie you can watch with the whole family :),1304812800,2,239,3.5283018867924527

4338181,4,B004EPYZNU,I saw this when it was in theatres and I really enjoyed it!  It was a cute feel good comedy.  If you're just looking for a cutesy movie to watch with family then this is perfect!  It made me laugh and it made me cry (okay well maybe just made my eyes water a tiny bit lol)  Alexa Vega and Camilla Belle are great in it and I really like the aunt too. (She was in the movie Babel and I loved her in that as well).  I don't think you'll regret watching this.,1304380800,4,456,3.8085106382978724
4338182,3,B004EPYZNU,"I'm not going to spend the next couple of paragraphs pinpointing the differences between ""From Prada to Nada"" and the novel it's based on, Jane Austin's ""Sense and Sensibility."" I'm going to judge it on its own terms, for I know that stories have been the inspiration for other stories pretty much as long as the genre has existed. And so, on its own terms, ""From Prada to Nada"" is an exhausted, simple-minded romantic comedy with a Latin twist. That it gets by at all can only be attributed to the charm and personality of stars Camilla Bell and Alexa Vega. And even then there are problems because their roles are inauthentic and only in service of the plot, which is itself so predictable that it suggests a negative assumption on the intelligence of the audience.

Bell and Vega play Nora and Mary Dominguez, young sisters living carefree, fabulously wealthy lives in Beverly Hills. When their father suddenly dies of a heart attack (on his birthday, of all days), they discover he was an irresponsible risk-taker and was ready to file for bankruptcy. This, in effect, renders his will meaningless. They also learn of his illegitimate son, Gabriel (Pablo Cruz), whose fiance, the venomous Olivia (April Bowlby), callously evicts the sisters with little more than the clothes on their backs. Penniless and orphaned, they're forced to move away from the sheltered affluence of Beverly Hills into the modesty of East Los Angeles, where they take residence with their aunt, Aurelia (Adrianna Bazzara).

Nora, the more responsible and less materialistic of the pair, adjusts fairly well to the new neighborhood. To make ends meet, she quits law school and takes a job at a law firm, where her boss is Edward (Nicholas D'Agosto), Olivia's kindly but reserved brother. The romantic tension is underwhelming but obviously significant to the story, so we're made to notice even if they have little if any chemistry. Nora keeps Edward at a distance, since falling in love doesn't gel with her ten-year plan. When they're not dancing around the issue of their feelings, they're handing a case that Nora landed during a bus ride to work, because let's face it, that's how all lawyers find clients; a group of Hispanic janitors, who were fired for allegedly stealing cleaning supplies, want to sue their former employer for wages that amount to an hour's less work than they put in.

Mary, spoiled and ignorant, doesn't easily adjust to East L.A. Here are some of the things she says about her situation: ""We're going to get shot."" ""No more shopping. No more high protein diet. Poor people only eat carbs."" Although the location has changed, she still dresses in designer clothing and stiletto heels, and her hair and makeup seem oddly professional, as if she still had access to expensive salons. In school, she falls for a hunky literature T.A., who she believes can get her back into Beverly Hills. We already know this won't work out, for she has already met Bruno (Wilmer Valderrama), Aurelia's neighbor from across the street. He and Mary hit it off like oil and water, mostly because, according to her standards, he just doesn't look the part. This character is little more than a pawn, included only to teach Mary - and the audience - about the value of not judging a book by its cover.

The movie displays a clear sense of humor when it comes to Mexican stereotypes, and admittedly, some of them are funny. My favorite gag was when Aurelia sees Edward at her door and panics, believing him to be an immigration officer; her relatives, who work in a makeshift clothing factory in the living room, frantically hide their sewing machines and turn the television to a channel showing a Dodgers baseball game. Many of them, however, are not all that funny; my least favorite was a recurring joke about Mary and Nora not being able to speak Spanish, despite the fact that they live in Los Angeles. They represent a thematic undercurrent, namely the sisters learning to embrace their Hispanic roots.

A film about cultural discovery and self-acceptance is perfectly fine. But ""From Prada to Nada"" is at heart a romantic comedy, a genre so innately preposterous that anything serious or compelling is overshadowed. Furthermore, the material is about as predictable as it can get. If you don't go into this movie already knowing how it will end, you obviously haven't seen as many romcoms as I have - and in most cases, I would say you're better off. The film has its moments, and in spite of their exaggerated performances, I appreciated Bell and Vega, who are both pretty and pleasantly upbeat. But on the whole, it's a disposable film, something that, in all likelihood, will not be remembered ten years down the line.",1296691200,16,4712,4.833952912019827

4338508,5,B004EPYZNU,"I bought ""FROM PRADA"" out of curiosity and for the cover picture with ""Will Work For Shoes"" sign Alexa Vega is holding , although Camilla Belle is the more attractive to me. Like ""THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA"" I  thought would be a fashion-based comedy, was.a bit nervous to find out it was an Hispanic telenovela film - and then was completely drawn into the story, by the situation, the girls and they way it was worked out..
If you haven't guessed, I'm not Hispanic  (I did get the ""Frida Kahlo"" joke, but that elsewhere) nor did I ever read ""Sense and Sensibility""; but I found this movie charming and engaging.
I don't post often; my taste is eclectic and diverse - I like what I like - and neither criticize (often) nor brag about movies.  But I did like ""FROM PRADA"" simply because I could identify with the characters and really enjoyed the movie.- and I like the background music, Cielito Lindo. I did get int Spanish and Cuban music (Thank You, Percy Faith and Herb Alpert!) And I am a Romantic.",1480809600,2,998,4.472527472527473

4340700,2,B004EPYZNU,"This movie felt waaay too rushed. Like the directors tried to squeeze a whole bunch of important details into a two hour time slot and ran out of time in the process. The acting was pretty good but the movie overall was just too choppy and some scenes were just too rushed. The directors seemed to have succeeded in getting the scenes that they wanted in the movie, but left out the little details that make a movie flow well and become slightly realistic. Time literally did not exist in this movie! I have no idea if the guy fell in love in a matter of days or months, and because I didn't know, it made it hard to delve into the movie and take some of the characters seriously. I give this movie two stars because I wasn't satisfied with the development.",1471046400,2,757,4.300699300699301

4342255,5,B004EPYZNU,"Man, I really really enjoyed this film. I haven't really left a review for a movie before on Amazon, but this is a great film that speaks about culture, identity, love, confidence, and finding out what really matters to you.

I love how East LA was prominently featured throughout the movie.

I've watched Camilla Belle before in one other film, but her and Alexa Vega really shine in this movie. Honestly, there were quiet, beautiful moments and their performance really was arresting.

Is the plot predictable? Yes... But it's very much worth it.

ALSO, April Bowlby (OLIVIA) is phenomenally evil and such a great actress in this movie. The package that she presents in this film is like 98%...The 2% is only because they put too much heavy makeup on her. But she's such an amazing actress and I'm probably going to find all her movies now and watch them :)

Kudos to everyone on this movie!",1468540800,,893,4.662420382165605

4342378,5,B004EPYZNU,I thought this was a fresh view of a story. It took you in to the lives of the Hispanic culture as most people see it.

I actually liked all the actors I feel like the script under utilizes them& skills and the setting of the story. My dislikes are the same as everyone else the probably offensive, non-believable make up job on the two main characters that was so bad that it took away from the story. The Nora love story that was not fleshed out at all almost like she Cinderella without the evil stepsister. They also could have added more to the brother's story. I feel with a little more time, script, and budget this could have been a five star movie. I still like it& will definitely watch it again. It is worth a gander.",1467158400,,782,4.326530612244898

I grew up in East Los Angeles and women, even newly from Mezico, don't dress up like Frida Kahlo. You would think the movie took place during the Mexican Revokution the way the East LA women were dressed- except for the gang girls. Also the corporate law firm representing janitors was just too much-almost insulting because corporate firms NEVER do that not even for pro bono. So these aspects disturbed me too much. It was entertaining, I liked seeing my neighborhood on the screen, the Mexixan women relatives had some funny lines, there some authentic aspects, it was an original idea. Promising but disappointed me. Might be a fun watch",1463097600,2,833,4.957142857142857

Alexa Vega and Camilla Belle, who play the Dominguez sisters, did an excellent job portraying the roles of a pair of wealthy Mexican-Americans who had lost touch with their cultural roots.  Due to an unexpected turn, they loose their wealth and are forced to live with their aunt in East LA.  Through a mixture of drama and humor, they soon understand the importance of family values, love and culture.  We highly recommend it!",1459900800,,536,4.659574468085107

My wife liked it though, so on average three stars (her opinion gets more weight)",1459209600,,545,4.860215053763441

4349286,4,B004EPYZNU,"Sense and Sensibility has always been a favorite story of mine.  The title of this film gives no indication that it is a modern rewrite of that story, so it took me far too long to even consider watching this.  However, once I found out what it was, I HAD to watch it, no matter whether it was done well or not... and I didn't have expectations that it would be anything but cheesy.
Boy were my expectations wrong.  While it parallels the original story well enough in plot points, it is nicely adapted to the California and LAMex cultures.  Many of the character details or events are converted in a symbolic or loosely-related-but-still-similar way, making the story interesting enough to even to those familiar with the original.
That is not to say there aren't some times when it seemed a little forced.  But those times are few enough to only be momentary distractions.  But they are there, and I imagine that someone watching this film who has never read or seen a film version of the original would likely wonder why they were written in.
I am not Latina, but not completely unfamiliar with MexAmerican culture.  This aspect of it seemed spot-on to me, but I do not know if someone of the culture would feel the same.  Oddly enough, I probably enjoyed it more for having that detail, rather than it being a ""white"" or homogenous family moving from Beverly Hills to poverty, I feel that added detail change enhanced the story quite well.
Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie.  It wasn't as mind-opening as the original, but probably would have been if I didn't know the story.",1454544000,7,1584,4.628571428571429

In this case it's about two sisters who lived the wealthy life styles that their father gave them only to one day lose it all after the father passes away.  They come from a Mexican family, but the girls were raised as Americans, thus, did not speak a word of Spanish.  One sister is kind and empathetic to the poor while the other sister is arrogant and look down upon her own kind, Mexicans.  When they lost everything, they had no choice but to move in with their aunt who lives in a poor neighborhood, but very rich in culture.  The question is, can they survive living this way with bare minimum and having to find jobs to survive.  Cute and somewhat romantic kind of movie.",1453680000,,780,4.26530612244898

I managed to watch until the end because I had nothing better to do after midnight & the movie was free on Prime. How did Doris get the attorney job without applying for it. Many plot holes. Why was drivel this made?,1453420800,3,471,4.827160493827161

4351138,4,B004EPYZNU,"This was a genuinely charming movie.  From its firm foundation in great source material (Jane Austen's ""Sense & Sensibility"") to the genuine charm and chemistry of the acting cast, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's possible that I enjoyed this immensely because I had such low expectations going into it. This was a freebie on Amazon Prime and I had no idea that this was based on an Austen novel.  As an Austenite, I was interested to see how this adaptation would deal with the Lucy Steele thread (which was largely negligible). Even the spirit of Austen's trademark skewering of mores was carried into the modern age. SPOILER ALERT: At first, I found the Nora/Edward separation a bit stretched,but her later explanation could be plausible and, through the transformative power of the Magic of Movie Logic, it could definitely work. Also (ANOTHER SPOILER), I loved how the writers were able to dispense of the brother's unsatisfactory wife, something which Austen, with the strictures of the society at the time, was unable to do. Is it an outstanding film? Hardly, but it is certainly a good popcorn movie, one you can settle in to watch, just to kill a few hours and not regret wasting time. This is classic romantic comedy with a Latin twist and it really works.  I'm impressed by the writers' & director's ability to maintain the spirit of Austen and translate it so deftly into a contemporary setting, thus proving to nay-sayers that Austen is as relevant today as she was in the nineteenth century. This is the mark of a great artist and one of the many reasons why her work has endured for so long and is held in esteem (and even affection) by scholars, critics and the general public.",1449532800,2,1712,4.738255033557047

I loved the parts of the movie where the family members spoke in Spanish - no there are no subtitles, but if you know a little Spanish you'll understand, and if you don't you aren't missing anything crucial.

4355699,3,B004EPYZNU,"The film is loosely based on the Austen novel Sense and Sensibility. Mary Dominguez (counterpart to Marianne Dashwood) is the younger, more frivolous sister who loves shopping on Rodeo Drive; Nora Dominguez (counterpart to Elinor Dashwood) is a law student who makes her ""ten year plan"" a priority.
After learning they have a half-brother Gabe, who along with his shrewish wife Olivia appear at their father's funeral and at the reading of his will, Nora and Mary learn that their father had been in bankruptcy, and they are forced to sell their beloved childhood home, Casa Bonita, to Gabe and Olivia in order to pay off their father's debts. When Olivia humiliates the sisters by announcing she was moving them to the basement, Nora and Mary leave and find refuge with their aunt Aurelia Jimenez in Boyle Heights, East L.A. There, Mary encounters her aunt's neighbor, Bruno, an artist that Mary at first thought was a gang member.
Nora, who had briefly met Olivia's handsome attorney brother Edward Ferris at lunch, takes a job at the law firm where Edward is a partner. They form an attraction which Nora abruptly breaks off after she kisses him at her aunt's Mexican Independence Day party, fearing that a romance would destroy her career. In the meantime, Mary has been having a relationship with her handsome, rich instructor Rodrigo Fuentes in hopes he can take her to Beverly Hills with him. She learns that he is married when she sees him and his wife at Edward's engagement party at Casa Bonita, and is so devastated she runs a red light and is seriously injured.
Nora and Edward are married at the end of the film, but there was no real time for their relationship to develop. They worked together on a case, he kissed her, she pushed him away long enough to get engaged to another woman and then admits her love for him at his engagement party. When did they go out to dinner? Have coffee? See each other in any capacity outside work? We assume the courtship began after he gave her a ring. Mary falls for Bruno and they are still dating at the end of the film, as we see Mary in the cluster of single women trying to catch Nora's bouquet.

4357336,1,B004EPYZNU,"I had high hopes when I saw the trailer for this film, but my hopes were not realized. This is a really poorly done film. I cannot believe it won any awards. It was basically a Mexican-American propaganda film. What else would you call it when one of the main characters states that of course he speaks Spanish - he lives in LA. The plot is beyond believable. Two girls are suddenly impoverished when their father drops dead of a heart attack. Unknown to them, he had been facing bankruptcy. At his funeral a brother the girls knew nothing about suddenly appears to claim his share of the inheritance. But there supposedly is none, remember? Yet they are allowed to keep the mansion they grew up in and everything in it. No creditor ever comes to take it away. But for some mysterious reason, the girls, who own 2/3 of the mansion and everything in it, foolishly sell it to their brother and end up penniless in the deal. Really stupid. They trounce off, penniless but owning a few expensive personal belongings to their poor aunt, who, even though she lives in LA, speaks virtually no English and who proceeds to sell everything of value the girls own and pocket the proceeds, in advance payment for their upkeep. There is a lot a mariachi music, which really sounds hokey and although there are some rough characters in the background, the poor Mexican part of town the girls end up in is mysteriously peopled by artists and various other good guys. Naturally, the girls end up alright in the end.
People say this movie was based on sense and sensitivity and if it was it just showed the poor judgement of the producer and directer. Sense took place in a time and place when women did not inherit, which is the fatal flaw in this plot, as these girls did inherit the major share of a mufti-million dollar mansion and everything in it. They never took their brother to court to fight out the apportioning of the inheritance.but simply handed it over to him without a fight.",1400630400,3,1974,4.547752808988764

I liked the glimpses into another culture and how close her family became after they moved in with the aunt (their mother's sister); The so-called poorer relatives (part of the NADA).  Enjoy!",1393286400,,581,4.818181818181818

4357481,4,B004EPYZNU,Great movie! It is a cute rewrite of sense and sensability and a movie I will watch again and again!,1381968000,,100,4.05
4357482,5,B004EPYZNU,"I loved this movie, thank you so much, as it was funnier than the previews, and the last person I tried to buy a copy from never sent it, so thank you so much for sending this to me, and I would buy other items from you.  :-)",1379721600,,225,3.6875
4357483,3,B004EPYZNU,"I wanted to love this.  I had to see it as I've seen nearly every Jane Austen adaptation.  I really respected the effort here to transpose Sense & Sensibility to modern-day Los Angeles and Hispanic/Mexican culture.  The sets, production values, and filming were good, and the scenery and art was fantastic.  However, the script was lacking in good dialogue and left some holes in the plot. I'm sorry to say that Camille Belle and some of the others were really poor actors which was very frustrating.  Also, the makeup jobs on the two lead characters made their faces ORANGE with no lipcolor.  It was very distracting.  I can only give it 3 stars.  As an Austin fan, I am glad I saw it but will NOT be purchasing it to add to my Austen movie collection.",1377734400,,753,4.485294117647059
4357552,5,B004EPYZNU,A fun look at the possibilities in life if things were to change unexpectedly. Good for young teens to see how others may deal with loss.,1377216000,,137,4.3076923076923075
4357553,5,B004EPYZNU,"Very cute, rainy day movie.  My husband has watched this twice and it still makes him laugh.  Very predictable but entertaining. . .",1376092800,,132,4.695652173913044
4357554,4,B004EPYZNU,"I think Jane Austen would appreciate this fun twist on her original classic.  Love is timeless!  For people who don't know Austen's book, you'll still get it.  It's a fun love story.",1375488000,,182,4.625
4357555,1,B004EPYZNU,"Except for the fact that this film is based on Mexican culture, and we definitely need more films based on other cultures besides mainstream America, it has little to recommend it. Bad dialogue, insulting reference to Sense & Sensibility by Jane Austen, really silly plot lines and confusing behavior by all involved.",1374624000,5,317,5.115384615384615

4357561,5,B004EPYZNU,I loved this movie even though I do not speak Spanish it was able to get the just of what they were talking about when they did speak Spanish.  It was funny and at times it was sad. I will probably watch it again and will recommend it to others. Overall a good movie,1371945600,,266,3.925925925925926
4357954,3,B004EPYZNU,"Premise good. Seemed like a first -time flick for a film-maker. But, it was not bad little movie for $1.99 rental.",1371513600,,114,4.476190476190476
4357955,3,B004EPYZNU,"It was slightly entertaining.  One might say the realities of siblings loosing their father that have to go live with a lower income relative.  But the way it all played out there was nothing realistic about it. It's a typical fairytale story with a fairytale ending. If you need a ""positive"" out of this, it is that the sisters adapted to the changes eventually.",1371340800,,363,4.65625
4357956,5,B004EPYZNU,"There are some movies you buy for their greatness and some you buy because you love to see love come true.  This is a feel good movie and even though it's not ever going to win awards, it's one I'd buy just because it makes me smile and feel good inside. I'm not a movie snob, but I am picky. This is a movie that I was happy to pick. :-)",1370995200,,338,3.76056338028169

4357958,5,B004EPYZNU,"Did not expect to be pulled into this movie as I was. Not just a contrast between rich and poor, but also between cultures and between values.",1370736000,,142,4.296296296296297
4357959,1,B004EPYZNU,"I love learning about different cultures. What I don't like is getting into a movie that's predominantly about a culture - in this case the hispanic culture in LA (which is different than the hispanic culture in the rest of the country) - and having the idiots and the bad guys all be white. How does anyone expect us to live together amongst different races, ideals, and cultures when slamming another culture?  I can recommend much better films with hispanic storylines.",1370649600,8,472,4.827160493827161
4357960,4,B004EPYZNU,"This film was pleasant and entertaining, if not very groundbreaking or original. The acting was good, the characters were not bad at all, and the plot had a decent progression to it (though the relationships did progress a bit fast at the end). This was not made to be high-art, but is instead a feel good comedy about two girls adapting to a new world view. I am just an ignorant white boy, but I thought the portrayal of Mexican-American culture wasn't bad at all, even if it wasn't very deep. It really sent the message that lower income Latino communities, at their core, value many of the same things that middle America does: family, loyalty, community, and love. In doing so, it avoided the pitfall of judgmental white-guilt tripping me into submission.

As a feel good romantic comedy, it's quite successful, and solidly enjoyable.",1370476800,,839,4.786206896551724

4358092,1,B004EPYZNU,Shocking that this even made it to video. Some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Don't waste your time with this one.,1370390400,6,119,4.217391304347826
4358093,4,B004EPYZNU,"An okay show with a good message, but very similar plot line to the traditional Cinderella story.  The acting was fairly good and the cloths were fun.",1370304000,,150,4.555555555555555
4358094,5,B004EPYZNU,Very enjoyable read and great way to wind down the day.  This book came in between a series or two of other books so this book was a great break in between.,1370131200,,156,3.875
4358095,1,B004EPYZNU,Bad Content I did not want to watch this film. It is not a good film to watch at all. I thought it was going a comedy. Its not!,1370131200,3,127,3.413793103448276
4358096,5,B004EPYZNU,"Not entirely a chic flick. Storyline is a good life lesson on how quickly material possessions can disappear, but family, friends and traditions have a way of enduring the test of time.",1370044800,,185,4.8125

4358098,3,B004EPYZNU,"A very simplistic rendition of Sense and Sensibility. Doesn't ask much of the viewer, except the willingness to go along with fairly unbelievable transitions. Tolerable for one of those nights when you just don't want to think at all.",1370044800,,234,5.0256410256410255

4358100,3,B004EPYZNU,I watched this with my wife and she liked it. It is the usual romo product.  I think most most who watch it will like it or be totally bored but I suppose t hat is why there are books.,1369872000,,184,3.6
4358101,5,B004EPYZNU,this is the best movie i have seen since the fast and furious movies. i love the mexican theme too it. and how they go from rich too poor.,1369526400,,138,3.793103448275862

4358224,4,B004EPYZNU,"I had avoided this movie when it first came out, thinking it was going to be a 'dumb rich girl' movie.  Instead, when I actually watched it, it had some meat to it.  Although it didn't get very in-depth throughout the movie, and some parts seemed a little disjointed, it was not a waste of time.  I gave it a 4 because it was more of a chick-flick, something I wouldn't watch with my husband, but still deserving of a higher score than a 3.",1368835200,,440,4.152941176470589

4358228,4,B004EPYZNU,Nice movie. Everyone will definitely enjoy it once.  I even rewound some parts of the movie as watching them once was not enough.,1368316800,,129,4.608695652173913

4358230,5,B004EPYZNU,"I love this film it is definately different than your average hollywood one; entertaining though. It contains some spanish and really speaks to Mexicans of all ages and locality. It has a little of bit of everything from immigration, culture, and fighting for what is right. I am sure this movie isn't for everyone but I am sure you will find it amusing.",1367884800,,354,4.634920634920635

4358294,4,B004EPYZNU,"I watched this movie because I wanted to watch something light before going to sleep. I thought it was going to be a cliche chick-flick kind of movie to watch when you're bored and/or sleepy. The beginning of it was not so interesting but I watched it anyway. As the story progressed; it started to become a good movie with a heartwarming touch, you know; family, friendship and love, so touching. I liked how it turned out to be and I loved the ending, though it was predictable. I gave it four stars because I enjoyed watching it. and I had a good night sleep afterwards :) .

4358296,4,B004EPYZNU,Nice movie. Of course the plot line is very predictable. Watched it on a Friday night and enjoyed it. Rated it 4 stars due to the very very predictable plot,1367366400,,156,4.233333333333333
4358297,4,B004EPYZNU,"The movie ""From Prada to Nada"" was wonderful, showing how a mixture of family some poor and some rich, can came around and be a true loving group of very mixed people.  The two sister whose father dies and they are left not just penniless, but homeless, also.  Their mother's aunt takes them into the Ghetto area in the very nice home she has made for herself and her businesses.

Along comes a half-brother with a girlfriend who is a nightmare and she the girlfriend has a brother who falls for the studious college law degree on her path to helping others in society who cannot afford the big shot wheeling dealing lawyers that most everyone cannot afford.  The brother falls for the college law sister and the youngest sister who takes poverty to heart and whines all the time how much she misses being rich and then when her BMW is sold by her aunt.  She decides one way or another she will get out of her aunts house no matter what it takes to do so.

The youngest sister meets a man, who comes to talk at her high school.  He his rich and very, very wealthy, she sleeps with him once and believes he will marry her.  However, he has to go to Mexico for a couple of weeks.  Then the fun begins and not with just the youngest sister who has a secret admire from the Ghetto, but also with the eldest daughter who finds herself kissed by her new boss who just so happens to be her half-brothers girlfriends brother.  She is confused and avoids him and then realizes she really is in Love for the very first time in her life.

4358299,4,B004EPYZNU,"It will not win an academy award.  But it was fun.  I love the joy the mexican culture has.  The plot was just plain predictable from beginning to end, but that's ok.  Sometimes you just want a happy movie.",1366761600,,206,4.205128205128205

4358372,3,B004EPYZNU,"This movie wasn't very original or creative. It was you average girl meets boy, doesn't realize she loves him until too late, gets him in the end.

Not great, but just fine if you're just looking for something to not have to pay too close of attention to.

The acting was so-so.",1366329600,,278,4.326923076923077
4358373,2,B004EPYZNU,"What a silly movie.  Don't waste your time.  The story is about two sisters of wealthy Mexican parents:  one is studying to become a lawyer while the other shops all the time.  Lo and behold, their father dies and it turns out he's bankrupt, and they have to move in with their aunt in East LA.  How stupid.",1366329600,2,307,4.224137931034483
4358374,3,B004EPYZNU,"I randomly picked this movie to watch on a boring afternoon.  It's your typical riches to rags story, but not that sappy.  I was entertained throughout, but some of the story was pradictable. It's not an Academy Award movie, but it does hold its own weight.",1366329600,,257,4.565217391304348
4358375,4,B004EPYZNU,"While not a movie to sit down and watch with the hubby, I enjoyed watching it.  Light humor and romance",1365984000,,103,4.15
4358376,3,B004EPYZNU,"It was kind of cheesy and predictable, but loved seeing all the hispanic actors in it. The two main female characters were bad and the make-up jobs HORRIBLE!!!",1365984000,2,159,4.714285714285714
4358377,5,B004EPYZNU,We loved this movie.  It was very enjoyable and taught some good lessons.  It was colorful and very entertaining.  Felt like we would fit right in with the culture.,1365811200,,164,4.586206896551724
4358378,3,B004EPYZNU,"Probably more directed at the teenage demographics, but I like to watch multicultural films and foreign films when I have time.  This seemed to be 'cutsie', a bit forced in the acting, but a fun cute film nontheless.  I loved Wilmer Valderama (sp) in this film...he was the quiet yet commanding presence.  I did enjoy the 'jilt' that the self-centered sister experienced, simply because it provided the 'switch' to get her to come out of her self-centeredness. Sadly in life, the transition is never so simple but it worked for the movie.",1365811200,,538,4.826086956521739
4358379,1,B004EPYZNU,"I actually watched it all the way through. Couldn't sleep one night, so I searched Amazon Prime Video for something to watch. The acting stunk, the dialogue stunk, the plot stunk. Worse movie ever, right next too the teenage vampire spoof Vampires Suck.",1365552000,4,253,4.906976744186046
4358380,4,B004EPYZNU,"This is an entertaining movie but nothing more than that. If you want to be engaged in a mindless activity for a little over an hour, this is the movie for you.",1365465600,,160,4.03125
4358381,3,B004EPYZNU,"The comedy was funny enough to be called a comedy, but the characters seem pretty stereotypical. I would call it a Hispanic Cinderella story.",1365465600,,141,4.916666666666667
4358461,4,B004EPYZNU,"Fun for the family (except for one scene) PG13+

4358462,4,B004EPYZNU,"it was a good movie though i did not like the fact that it makes the Latino community sound like only when they are poor can they appreciate their heritage, It does not matter whether you have money or not, but that you are close and appreciate all your family.",1365465600,,261,4.24
4358463,3,B004EPYZNU,"Writing and acting wash't that good but story was good.

4358960,5,B004EPYZNU,The average rating for this film is misinformed and misleading. This movie is an amazing experience in Mexican culture and the purity of unconditional love within a family as well as love between a man and a woman. This one is a must see! I am so glad that we have unlimited streaming because I will see this film a few more times!,1362873600,3,331,4.26984126984127
4359051,3,B004EPYZNU,"Cute, fun to watch no deep dark plot or hard to follow sub plots.  Language was typical, but more than I would have liked and did not seem to ""add"" - rather detracted from the story.  Predictable all the way, but some funny lines.  Not one I'm planning to watch again, but I seldom do that anyway.",1362614400,,297,4.175438596491228

4359054,3,B004EPYZNU,"I happened to catch ""The Quiet"" on TV last week, an underrated film that I've already reviewed and really liked.  That film also had Camilla Belle, she gave an excellent performance there, so I decided to watch this film because, well, it was ""free.""  At least since I have Amazon Prime.

Now, ""The Quiet"" was a real surprise, a far better film than critics wanted to give it credit for.  This film, on the other hand, is a by-the-book-and-by-the-numbers RomCom, where you pretty much know everything that is going to happen before it ever does.  Why?  Well, even if you haven't seen this film before -- which I hadn't until this weekend -- I had seen it probably a thousand times before:  Girl gets guy, girl loses guy, . . . . Well, you get the picture.

But this film isn't completely awful.  There are some funny moments, and Ms. Belle is pretty good here as the riches-to-rags-to-riches damsel in distress.  But she's actually more than that; while her sister seems hopeless to fend for herself, Ms. Belle is more of a modern-day gal who could probably make it through the day without some dude.

Ah, but why should Ms. Belle have to live this way?  You'll have to watch to find out for yourself, even though you'll know how it ends just as it's starting.  But I'll give it a very minor recommendation anyways, especially since it's, well, ""free.""",1362355200,,1352,4.583333333333333

4359056,3,B004EPYZNU,"This isn't ""mental giant"" viewing, but then, not all can be. It's a cute movie that you can watch while doing other things and still keep up. It takes no thought to watch or understand.",1362182400,,185,4.314285714285714
4359057,4,B004EPYZNU,"It was an interesting movie that we watched with the kids with the happy ending.  There were a couple of unexpected themes, but basically, the ending was predictable.  We did learn a little about Mexican culture.",1362009600,,212,4.861111111111111

I like the portrayal of the different types of personalities and characters, the typical everyday life that people experience just to survive, the conflicting characters, the hiding and outburst of emotions and that before the fall there is a realization that they already possess the qualities needed to survive such as planning, talent, beauty, compassion, intelligence that they inherited and learned from their upbringing.",1360454400,,561,5.076086956521739

4359635,1,B004EPYZNU,"I get the whole idea of one artist inspriring another.  This often happens in a really good way - WEST SIDE STORY is an example of a well done update of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET.  O PIONEERS was based on ancient Greek mythology.  CLUELESS was a pretty good update of Jane Austen's EMMA. Even Shakespeare himself based many of his plays on earlier stories that he adapted for the stage. These adaptations were done with a genuine understanding of the original works and were interesting takes on an older idea.  Art, music and literature would be nowhere if artists composers and writers could not build upon each other's work.

But it really shouldn't be done by someone with less talent than the original artist, and there is no use for it unless it can in some way enhance, or at least equal the original. When a piece of art becomes the basis for new art, it needs to be more than a shoddy, lazy attempt to steal from an artist with greater talent.

FROM PRADA TO NADA is just a cheap copy, with none of the depth, sensitivity, humor, or insight of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  It doesn't appear that the screenwriter has even the least understanding of the story he/she stole, but is simply capitalizing upon the current ""Jane Austen Craze"" to make a fast buck - exploiting not only Jane Austen, but the Mexican American culture in the process.  The whole thing is just weird.  No passion, no message, no depth.  Just poor acting and a poorly thought out script that has stolen it's core idea from a much greater work without giving back to the original in any way.

The writers and producers of this movie should be ashamed.  If you have talent, then write your OWN original story.  If you have a very exceptioal talent, they MAYBE you can try to stand on the shoulders of giants that have gone before you and produce a work that enhances the beauty of a masterpiece.  If you don't have talent, you had best keep your hands off things you don't understand.",1348790400,3,1962,4.536931818181818

Alexa Vega and Camilla Belle play two very different sisters who grew up wealthy but lost everything and were forced to essentially start a new life in a deeply-hispanic barrio in east L.A.

The movie carries a message about the importance of family and is the perfect film for the teenage drama queen in your life. It might be fairer to the movie and Jane Austin to claim the film was inspired by her book rather than being based on it.

4359712,4,B004EPYZNU,"From the box this looked like a rather brainless comedy, and some days, when you've worked all day and you want a laugh that is what you want, something fun, not too deep that will make you laugh.  The movie far exceeded expectations for me.

The premise of the story is two rich, and totally opposite 20 somethings are left penniless when their father has a heart attack on his 55th birthday.  They are devastated, but even moreso when they realize he actually had filed for bankruptcy and the high life would soon change for them, when they move from their mansion near Rodeo Drive to their aunt's home in East LA.  One sister is going to law school and she is the one that adapts the best, the other can't quite make the transition to the new neighborhood.  One of the best lines in the film is when she judges a guy she sees on the street who is wearing a hoody and looks a little scruffy, saying ""Are you Homeless?"" and he says ""No, are you?"".  Yeah, that one was tough.  Can't judge a book.....

Though this looked more like a comedy, and had comedic moments it is more a story about how family, tradition and heritage are so important and having a good life doesn't necessarily mean having all the material things that you want.  Both sisters learn important lessons in their fall from Prada to Nada and come out the better for it.

I did not know any of the actors in the film, but felt that the acting was good and the story, though a bit predictable was very enjoyable.  I'm also a sucker for a good ending and I really liked this one.

Overall, a feel-good movie, with a bit of heart.",1322179200,15,1595,4.315436241610739
4359713,5,B004EPYZNU,"I admit it; when I first saw the title of this movie, I figured it was going to be just like that lousy movie the Duff sisters did years earlier.  I decided to watch it on cable last night, sticking to my new rule that, if a movie doesn't hold my interest after the first 20 minutes, it goes off.  Even a bad movie can do that as opposed to something boring, and I ended up not only keeping it on, but loving it!

True, there is nothing ground breaking here in plot, but I'll admit I didn't see a lot of parallel between the story and Sense and Sensibility (And I've seen the BBC adaptation with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), but I have to say this is the best romantic dramedy I've seen in some time since While You Were Sleeping.  The reason is simple:  aside from the one scene where Alexa Vega's character Mary was obviously sleeping with the literary professor, it was clean, charming, and contained a good moral lesson on society's dictates.

Mary and Norah (Camilla Bell), two sisters couldn't be more different, are virtually tossed out of their home after their bankrupt father dies by their half-brother's nasty fiancee', Olivia (played very convincingly by April Bowlby) and have no choice but to move into the home of their kindly Tia Aurelia (a charming and likeable Adriana Barraza).  While Norah willingly foregoes law school to obtain a job and adjusts relatively well to the girls' new lowly status, Mary still wants desperately to go back to the lifestyle she has been accustomed to, and thinks this will come about by hooking up with her lit teacher.  She blows off the admiration of Aurelia's neighbor Bruno (Wilmer Valderrama, Fez from That 70s Show), and keeps running around dressed like she never left her old life behind, managing to keep her tresses golden, and never admitting to being Mexican unless the tough neighborhood girls give her a hard time.

Norah has troubles of her own; she has a ten year plan to become a top lawyer, but Olivia's decidedly nicer brother Edward (Nicholas D'Agosto) has romantic designs on her.

I don't want to give too much away, but the girls find out that life doesn't necessarily turn out a certain way just because that's what you want, and they both have some growing up to do--especially Mary, the epitome of Barbie syndrome.  Chock full of funny cultural and societal jokes, yet serious enough to be moved by all the characters, this is an enchanting film that the whole family can watch.  It also has nice Latino cultural accents, a great soundtrack, and nice cinematography.  Spanish subtitles are nice too, because my espanol no es tan bueno.  It makes me want to become fluent again as I watched the girls slowly learn to make it their second language.  Though the ending turned out like I thought it MIGHT, there were still some pleasant twists and turns I didn't see coming, which was a welcome surprise.  The biggest surprise was seeing Wilmer Valderrama play such a cool, confident, strong character as opposed to the bumbling, comical Fez.  I had a great time watching this film, was left with the warm fuzzies, and if you like romantic dramedies with a little something distinctive so it's not completely cookie cutter, this one is for you.

Like the novel, I found the A plot, Nora and Edward, to be a bit dull, while the B plot, Mary and Bruno (Marianne and Brandon) to be endearing and sigh worthy. Alexa Vega does a really nice job as Mary...whoever plays Nora is terrible. While this movie is not as good as Clueless, I also don't think Sense and Sensibility is as good as Emma, yet both are worth reading just as this movie is more than worth watching.

4359719,3,B004EPYZNU,"This film appealed to me as a bilingual, and overall I found it to be lighthearted and a fairly fun watch with friends.

The good news is that the film is shot fairly well, especially with respect to real-deal scenes of East Los Angeles.  I greatly enjoyed the music score, which ranged from classic mariachi songs to upbeat Salsa.

I was happy with the cast, and Adriana Barraza (the maid from Babel) steals every scene as aunt Aurelia Jimenez.  Wilmer Valderrama is convincing (though cliche-chasing) as the cholo with a heart, and it's great to see him in something different than the ""Fez"" type characters.

The downside is that the film is a little light on laughs.  There are a few laugh-out-loud moments, though they aren't frequent in this movie.  There are definitely a few jokes and moments in the film that would be more funny to Spanish speakers, or at least anyone familiar with Mexican-American culture.

Camilla Belle is a solid actress, though I wasn't too sure about her being cast as the lead.  Granted Belle's half-Brazilian in real life, but it was bizarre that the producers spray tanned her a nuclear orange color in order to ""look the part"" of a Mexicana.

Like plenty of rom-coms, From Prada to Nada is certainly predictable, although there were a few minor twists and turns along the way.

As a guy, I thought this was a lighthearted watch, and worth a rental.  The ladies I watched it with (also Spanish-speakers) all loved it, and there were more than a couple ""Awwwwww!"" moments, plus some tears.

I even used it to practice my Spanish.

The moment I realized this movie was supposed to be based on Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility, I wanted to watch it. I'm a big Jane Austen fan! Of course common sense tells us it really isn't Jane Austen, or even especially Austen-like, and if it were, you wouldn't be able to finish it in 2 hours.

Yes, it is very, loosely based on Sense and Sensibility.  VERY LOOSELY, mostly in thematic strains, but you can still see the connection.

The twist is that the characters are based on a hispanic family in Los Angeles.  There is an easy transition from english to spanish in the film, with the spanish dialogue subtitled.  This is a particularly charming aspect of the movie as the transition happens effortlessly and really lends to the comical aspect of the film.  Being hispanic myself,  only made it more endearing to me.  The family from East Los Angeles, reminded me so much of relatives and friends, I was crying with laughter!  The aunt is truly a wonderful actress and has some of the funniest lines.  Bruno, played by Wilmer Valderama, is exceptional.  HIs subtle approach to his character was a pleasant  surprise.  Alexa Vega plays the perfect ""Barbie"" character!

Knowing some spanish/spanglish is a definite plus to get the idiosyncrasies of the script but, by no means, restricts any viewer from getting the humor.

The rest of the film is the two girls meeting men and having romance, which was not interesting to me as a guy. I rate this last portion of the film at 2-stars.

The movie promotes sleeping around. Alexa regrets sleeping with a guy that she does not end up marrying, but does not regret not saving herself for her husband; she does not regret the practice of promiscuity. God created sex to not even awaken, much less happen until after the marriage ceremony. Thus, I cannot recommend this film.

There is a funny scene of Alexa smoking marijuana and then coming to the family dinner stoned. The scene is entertaining; however, in real life marijuana is not so harmless. John McEnroe went from the number-one tennis player in the world to number twenty-three after he began smoking marijuana. He also then married heroin addict Tatum O'Neal. Marijuana brings you into close relationships with some bad people, which you would otherwise keep at arms-length. I am not saying Tatum O'Neal is a bad person. She is someone Mr. McEnroe might have otherwise not married or might have delayed marrying until she stopped her drug use; had Mr. McEnroe not also taken such a casual attitude towards drugs at the time. I know of other examples of marijuana smokers getting involved with some truly bad people.

The film then goes into some propaganda of a corporate lawyer helping the poor for free. Yes; there are probably a couple of such lawyers somewhere in the country, but most lawyers, which I have encountered are lying, greedy, crooked, self-serving, fellows; working within a civil-lawyer-cartel, of lawyers and their pals the lawyers in black robes, who deny justice to the poor, self-represented, person, who must go to civil-court without a lawyer.",1518393600,,1994,4.80466472303207
