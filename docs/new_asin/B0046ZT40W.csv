4271746,2,B0046ZT40W,"One problem with unrated videos with incomplete descriptions is that the content can blindside viewers. I enjoy watching Masterpiece with my kids but am rather conservative so I found the unexpected scenes of coerced sex and homosexuality in this series objectionable. But it provided a good teachable moment for discussing how producers and writers try to foist their views of morality on the masses.

I also question whether material written less than 10 years ago should be labeled as classic...",1294617600,51,498,5.225

Downton Abbey begins with news of the Titanic disaster and the arrival of a new valet for Lord Crawley.  Both events have far reaching consequences.  The heir to the entailed Downton is lost at sea, and the new valet dashes the hopes of an ambitious footman.

The new Downton heir is an unknown third cousin who, horrors!, has A Job and there is much sneering and judging as he and his mother become part of life at Downton.  The plan is to match one of the daughters to The Heir, but they have plans of their own as does The Heir.  Dame Maggie Smith is Lord Crawley's ascerbic mother, and perks things up considerably when she appears.  Elizabeth McGovern is very convincing as Cora, Lady Crawley, an American who married for love though her husband didn't.  In fact, most of the cast is splendid, as are the costumes and sets.  My one quibble is that except for Dame Maggie Smith none of the women looks at home in the clothes.  Notice I didn't say ""comfortable"".

There's plenty of interesting stuff going on in Downton Abbey--secrets, lies, attempted blackmail and hidden agendas--as well as some superb acting.  There are also some situations and characters I just didn't buy and some very ill bred behavior from people who should know better. For example, Lord Crawley's mother, played by Maggie Smith, is insufferably rude to the new heir's mother, yet the next day she goes out of her way to be kind to the lady's butler.  Perhaps this was meant to indicate the difference in her regard for an upstart relative versus a valued family retainer, yet it was a bit jarring. Still, all the backstabbing, gossip and undermining in Downton Abbey makes for great soap opera.

Fans of Upstairs Downstairs can't help but compare and contrast the two series and I have to say this.  Downton Abbey doesn't have the same magic as Upstairs Downstairs, nor the same sense of a bygone time.  Upstairs Downstairs was about people, both aristocrats and servants, who spent their lives struggling to live up to very high standards, sometimes impossibly so.  That's what made it so fascinating.  It had a grace and an elegance and a leisurely pace that's missing in Downton Abbey, not to mention the lovely manners everyone had under any and all circumstances.

Downton Abbey is kind of Desperate Edwardian Housewives meets Stately Home Dynasty, and it's fun to watch, just don't expect Eaton Place.  Sigh.",1294531200,7,2407,4.7542168674698795
4271748,3,B0046ZT40W,"The PBS Masterpiece version isn't a complete version of this series. The run time is close to 6 hours, but the original is about 8 hours. An article about this appeared in Telegraph. [...]. It was changed for us American viewers. Anyway, I'd like the unabridged version. Does anyone know where to get the original version that ran on ITV but in a U.S. DVD format?",1293926400,18,363,4.515151515151516
4271749,4,B0046ZT40W,"This luxury version of  'upstairs, downstairs' is a delight from first to last, and should not be missed by costume drama addicts, even though the basic story line may seem somewhat uninvolving: Lord Crawley, earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), owner of the Downton estate, only has three daughters, and an old entail stipulates that house and land can only be inherited by a man. When the heir-to-be is killed in the Titanic disaster, in comes solidly middle class lawyer Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) as an unwilling successor, with his feisty, emancipated mother (Penelope Wilton) in tow. Soon speculation and intrigue are rife to save the family inheritance from this upstart, or at least to get him married to Lord Crawley's proud and wilful (yet troubled) eldest daughter.

Meanwhile, the servants downstairs are the engine behind several smaller subplots that keep the series moving. Some of these plots may be somewhat unlikely, but they are always entertaining. Here, too, there's a red thread, of a nasty lady's maid and a dashing but evil footman conspiring against Lord Crawley's new valet, Mr. Carson. And of course the upstairs and downstairs people are constantly crossing each others paths, sometimes with surprising or dramatic results.

Julian Fellowes has devised a deft scenario that is particularly admirable for its development of several main characters. Some who seem unsympathetic at first truly 'grow up' in the course of the series. Also, he has the courage to end the series on a distinctly muted note. I was less convinced by the seemingly extreme familiarity between some servants and the family (maids entering the earl's library uninvited and without even knocking), nor by some very unlikely coincidences. Mr. Carson does seem a bit too good to be true, and the butler rather an oaf for maintaining in service an obviously double-crossing footman - but these doubts never really interfered with my enjoyment of the whole, which is primarily due to the quality of the acting. The series is set in an interesting period, spanning the years from the sinking of the Titanic to the outbreak of WWI. Highclere Castle, a countrified version of the London Houses of Parliament, is an original choice as Downton Abbey. Costume and detail are exquisite throughout.

But the highlight of the series is without a doubt Maggie Smith as Lord Crawley's indomitable mother. Her lines are full of hilarious asides worthy of some formidable Oscar Wilde aunt, and are bound to elicit a few chuckles.",1292284800,75,2513,5.092233009708738

Set between 1912 and 1914, Downton Abbey chronicles the conflict of class, gender, and politics, and serves it up with a refreshing dollop of sizzle and scandal. Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern, and Dame Maggie Smith (as Robert, Earl of Grantham, Cora, Countess of Grantham, and Violet, Dowager Countess of Grantham, respectively) are knock outs, but the rest of the cast are no slouches either, with the stunning Michelle Dockery at the forefront as Lady Mary Crawley, who is the selfish, proud, and vindictive eldest daughter you can't help but like. The actors and the stunning interiors of Highclere Castle, home to the Earls of Carnarvon, give Downton Abbey a glossy, sophisticated sheen, even when the script's twists and turns can be a bit of a let-down. Nevertheless, the drama is engrossing and invigorating, and a worthy addition to the collection of any period drama aficionado--and anyone who likes good drama, period!",1289606400,793,1609,6.740384615384615
4271752,4,B0046ZT40W,"I became aware of this wonderful ITV series while reading a message board about Larkrise to Candleford (another great series, highly recommended).  I've just viewed it on youtube thank you british folks!  After I watched it, it occurred to me that it was somewhat like ""Upstairs Downstairs"" in that you saw the workings ""above the stairs"" and was as down.  The difference is that it is set in a magnificent country mansion (or seat, whatever, I'm not british).

It's set in the early 1900s.  The costumes and settings are superb.

I did feel the earl was a little to egalitarian concerned about the downstairs staff, just too ""nice"".  From the series 1901 house, on pbs, the servants/staff were to be as out of view as possible.

It was offensive, and a picture now in their minds that didn't need be there.
Yes, we are bible-believing Christians!

4271871,1,B0046ZT40W,"I know I'm very late to the Downton Abbey party in the year 2017, but a friend got me the complete set as a gift, and I feel obligated to watch all six seasons.  My friend bought this for me because I enjoy classic novels turned into British film adaptations such as the Jane Austen and Charles Dickens novels.  I'm sorry to say, this series is nothing like those wonderful stories.  In fact, it's absolutely dreadful.

Perhaps the biggest problem is the central character, Mary Crawley.  I can't recall having ever seen such a vindictive, rude, and nearly sociopathic central character in any story.  Season one opens with Mary having discovered that her fiancee has perished on the Titanic, and she doesn't even bay an eye about it.  No, she wasn't really in love with him, but the way she handles it and the coarse personality of the actress portraying her lays the groundwork for a character that is very, self-involved and cold-hearted, who NEVER changes.  Now, with a central character like that, it's impossible to have any sympathy for her or care about what happens to her.  She's manipulative and enjoys insulting others and taking part in their pain.  I hated her, and you will, too.

Mary is supposed to be the SYMPATHETIC character, so you can imagine what the others are like.  This series has some of the most despicable, plotting, backstabbing, angry, bitter, and loathsome characters I've ever seen.  The worst part is that they NEVER get their comeuppance.  There's no justice.  They just win and win and win, which makes it agonizing to watch several other characters constantly preyed upon with no sense of ever being avenged.  This never-win atmosphere makes it terribly frustrating, unsatisfying and ultimately, exhausting to sit through episode after episode for six LONG seasons.  So many things go wrong; so many people are playing angles and agendas, and keeping secrets that it crosses into maudlin melodrama and simply can't be taken seriously anymore.  As with most serial soap operas (which is what this is, not real drama), they NEVER allow anyone to be HAPPY.  Just when someone is about to realize a dream or find true love, the writers come up with yet another way to destroy their joy with yet more scheming or secrets and lies.  It would nice if the audience had something positive to hang onto rather than having their hopes beaten down episode after episode.  There are also many eye-rolling moments where the Lord and Lady of Downton Abbey, as well as their heads of staff, make completely idiotic decisions to keep horrible people on staff, even through they know they're thieves and liars.  Of course, the writers apparently could find no other way to keep the drama going than to find nonsensical reasons to keep the ""baddies"" of Downton Abbey on the show.

Lastly, I was HUGELY turned off by the ham-fisted way the writers beat the audience over the head with their liberal socialist and even communist politics.  I wanted to be entertained, not preached at.  It's clear right from episode 1 that the central theme of this entire series is the ""emancipation"" of women.  Thus, there are constant references to the so-called poor plight of women because they can't inherit property or vote.  Far worse things have happened in the world, but you'd never know it from Downton Abbey.  In the first season, Mary screams at her mother, ""I don't want to dedicate the next 40 years of my life to duty and service, like you.""  Ouch.  As if being a mother and homemaker is the unpardonable sin of feminism.  Add to the mix younger daughter, Sybil, who is a political ""community organizer"" to coin a communist phrase, and regularly attends political rallies for ""change"".  At the same time, the chauffer openly admits he's a communist revolutionary and regularly reads Marx and Engles.  The phrase ""Things are changing"" is constantly repeated, as much is made of women's right to vote and the overbearing theme of the ""strong woman"" in scenario after scenario. Apparently, the writers didn't learn in world history class that the communist/socialist Bolshevik revolution in Russia in 1917 slaughtered 60 million people before the end of Trotsky, Swerdlov, Molotov, Lenin and Stalin's reign in 1952.  But hey, Hollywood communists can even make genocide look sexy.  Pass on this trash for all these reasons, and more.",1514851200,2,4347,4.89207650273224

There is nothing left to say at this point about this series because everyone knows what it encompasses and if it's for them.  I just truly thank PBS for producing and broadcasting this series.  It is sorely needed in this world of crudeness mistaken for talent.  Honestly,  it didn't need a bit of that to be superb.  That is the sign of true artistic expression, true artistic talent and creativity, and I'm so thankful for this series.  Adult humor, intelligence, silliness, irony, deep character development, historical accuracy, it has it all.  Those shows and movies endeavoring to gain success through shock value and exploiting women, for example, have much to be jealous of, because this series kicks those series' asses.  The historical accuracy down to how they sit, speak, move their heads, et cetera, is extensively researched and executed, but the humor and vulnerability of aristocracy makes us watch it.  Lord Grantham, well, he was Squiggy in Knotting Hill, and I was so surprised to see him here in such a gallant role, such a dichotomy, but he pulled it off beautifully.",1511481600,12,1353,4.96

4271887,5,B0046ZT40W,"Be warned, if you watch season one you'll be hooked and will have to watch the next five seasons. Superior PBS and BBC Masterpiece Theater presentation. The winner of many awards. Outstanding cast. Meticulous attention to detail when it comes to costumes and props. It really looks England in the early part of the century. Its the story of an aristocratic British family from about 1910 through 1930. Plenty of drama to keep the viewer's attention: romance, unexpected death, sibling rivalry, murder, rape, financial problems, World War 1, gay lifestyle, class warfare and more. However most of the characters are decent people and you wind up routing for them in the end.",1505433600,,673,5.017857142857143

4271889,5,B0046ZT40W,"Loved it! Just watched this again and I'd seen it since its first broadcast.  It's got truth in it. Probably how the Landed Gentry liked to see themselves. We all know it wasn't a typical family/ household staff relationship.  But as an American with Scottish kin, who own and steward estates on a vastly smaller scale, this helps outsiders in.  These estates used to contain and employ entire villages of families, and the responsibility for their well-being was a given. Not universally, but some places.  This allows Americans to see that part of the equation.",1505174400,,563,4.894736842105263
4271890,5,B0046ZT40W,"After one episode you are hooked, hooked by the intrigues and lives of both the servants, and the family they care for.

4271892,3,B0046ZT40W,"Today I watched episode 1 and may give the second episode a go today. Curiosity, late summer limited options, and many reccomendations from others swayed me to watch it. I was neither hooked nor repulsed.
Beautiful sets, talented actors, costumes appropriate and well done. Is it accurate? As best I can tell it is true to the period and place. Is it entertaining? Spots were better than others and the entirety sent me in search of levity afterwards. I found it dragged on and at times tripped itself in quagmire.
Essentially Victorian England with mass of servants - interesting to see this portion of the lives back then. Servants of all type and variable personality, they may have had the choice to become such as a part in limited lives of the very upper 'class'. Class? Ahhhh well the Mr does seem to have a trace of it in him, but the rest of the family is lacking completely of it. Maggie Smith's Dowager has more class in her pinkie than the entire Abbey holds. Perhaps a fine example of age and wisdom or is it the limited presentation seen?
Social commentary in a most entangled era of confusion. Shall we flaunt convention - shall we promote the rights of women? Should we accept a less than perfectly able bodied employee? Are newcomers welcome or to be made miserable and sent packing whilst we stab them in the back? Should we marry for love or money?
Hoity, petty, stuffy, and above all stiff - it is the time represented and a time long gone. Unfortunately it could almost be switched for other eras with little effort other than sets and setting - including the era we live in. Still relevant in these issues shows how backwards the world was - still is. Disturbing and thought provoking, it mirrors much that is current in the world - but I can't call it entertaining at this point.",1504742400,,1802,4.547692307692308

4271916,1,B0046ZT40W,"Never having seen DA we decided to give it a go since it was included in Prime Video.  About 30 minutes into the first episode there was a scene between the Duke and a Footman that made my stomach turn.  I couldn't believe it and neither could my wife (who suspected that something ungodly was afoot leading up to this scene).  This was the last type of program I expected to see something so vile and inhumane portrayed on.  I was totally blindsided by this and my wife and I discussed the prospect of many children having seen this as well.  After all this is PBS, and programming on PBS is supposed to be a sort of last bastion of decency and etiquette.  However, people just don't seem to care about morals anymore.  Or better yet, morals have become a fluid motif, that changes with the constant ebb and flow of human desire.  We override our conscience and eventually shrug off things we initially know to be wrong, if enough people agree with or participate in them.
I immediately turned off the program (which had been entertaining up to that point) and resolved that it will never be played in my house.  Those involved with the program have already made and will continue to make immense revenue and the series has made history.  No matter, it will never come across a television screen in my house.  'So what?' you may say.  'Who cares about you and your house?'  I do.  Filth is everywhere on television these days and people across the world are being lulled into a state of indifference relative to immorality.  At some point however, you have to take a stand.  After all, who is God?  The Lord?  Or society?",1501545600,3,1622,4.4965753424657535

I finally decided to watch an episode out of curiosity and to prove to myself that it was no good, but by the 2nd episode I was captured by the cliffhangers and by the 3rd or 4th episode I was completely hooked. I got my family and my boyfriend into it. Absolutely brilliant show. It will make you smile, cry, laugh and upset you.",1501459200,,397,4.037974683544304

Of course like everyone else, I was hooked instantly.  I loved it so much I decided to start from the very beginning again when I saw it on Amazon. Beautifully acted, and lovingly produced, there is so much to enjoy about this series it's hard to pick out the best parts. There is a wonderful balance between the storylines with the servants and the aristocrats. The characters are beautifully drawn and very relatable. The truth is at the end of the day it's an extremely high end ""soap opera"". I mean that in the best way possible. It's a pure joy to watch.",1501459200,10,729,4.440298507462686
4271919,3,B0046ZT40W,"Much of it is pretty predictable. The characters don't really develop a lot. Once you've watched a scene or two with that character you pretty much know who they are and that's about as much depth and breadth you're going to get about that person. Everything about the scenery/background is just a little too perfect to seem very realistic. But it's still fun to watch and there is usually at least a very small element of unpredictability that can keep a viewers interest. It's also kind of fun to see a little bit about the lifestyle these people lived, even if it does seem a little bit contrived. Another one of those things that is just not as impressive as I was hoping it would be after hearing the rave reviews.",1501372800,,719,4.4961832061068705

Downtown Abbey avoids of all of the standard cheesiness; it's has really rich characters who are painstakingly built over multiple episodes. The show starts off slow in the first episode (pilot), but it picks up pace after that. Each episode is very intense and develops the plot by a lot.

The realities of English aristocratic life are showcased without attempting to mask the social difference between servants and the aristocrats. Not a moment is wasted in the narrative and each episode is filled with subtlety.",1485475200,,591,5.145833333333333

4273152,3,B0046ZT40W,I view it as a comedy. The plots have some funny holes in them. Lots of contrived plots - like one of those 1930's B movies. English actors are super good and well trained. They keep switching antagonists to protagonists and back - and again. The old ways of the aristocracy and common folk are interesting. But it does not reflect the interrelationships that existed in reality between masters and servants. Masters were much harsher and the women were taken advantage of much more. Life was much tougher for the common folk.,1484179200,,526,4.728260869565218

The characters develop significantly (and in unexpected ways) as the series twists and turns to its satisfying conclusion.  Although it leaves you wanting more, I believe then ended the series at the perfect time in the story line.  It is also just great ""creature comfort"" viewing.  Maggie Smith is amazing.

4274091,5,B0046ZT40W,"The characters in this series are not a group of angels. Nonetheless it is strangely heart warming to watch their saga evolve. In the real world, the saga of 2016 just put me in a dismal outlook as the New Year's approached. I needed to be ""taken away"" and not by alcohol or drugs! So on New Year's Eve I had a Downton Abbey Season 1 marathon, even though I had watched it at least twice before. The series held up and indeed was a good and entertaining distraction.
If you are like me, and tend to shy away from all those English Victorian shows, please know this one transcends that and is a good representation of what people go through as the world changes around them and beyond their control.",1483315200,2,698,4.33587786259542

Seeing the British aristocracy have to change with the times and the growth of the characters will make you want to watch this through all five seasons.  This is my second time watching this and I continue to laugh at the Dowager, cry with Lady Mary, Lady Edith and Branson, cheer on Mrs. Passmore, Mrs. Hughes, Anna and Bates and  despise Mr. Green and Thomas.  This show has such good acting that you feel like you are a part of it all.  Try it and I assure you, the Yorkshire countryside, the castle and the characters will keep you enthralled.",1483228800,,683,4.424

The strong characters; story plots and amazing sets, costumes and country/city scenes are so well developed and breathtaking.  One feels as if one has been transported to the early 1900's...  I will say, the first episode is a bit overwhelming, trying to acquaint one's self with all of the characters, but they fall in place quickly, as all are memorable.

4274438,5,B0046ZT40W,"Each Season of Downton Abbey has its own challenges for the family and staff.

Season One introduces the main character and the pressing problem of the succession for the Earl of Grantham. Having only daughters, the Earl is not able to pass on the estate, and finds it necessary to groom the next in line, a cousin, who is a solicitor. The oldest daughter, the Lady Mary, is particular about with whom she will be involved, and her parents seek to find a positive match. Their second daughter, the Lady Edith, although actively seeking an appropriate relationship is frequently the victim of Mary's sabotage. The third daughter, the Lady Cybil, becomes involved in what seems to be an inappropriate relationship.

Hugh Bonneville as the Earl and Elizabeth Montgomery as his wife are often at odds with the Dowager Countess, played excellently by the Dame Maggie Smith, whose timing and wit and sensitivity bring a realism and charm to the role.

The downstairs staff featuring Jim Carter as the Butler, Phyllis Logan as Mrs Hughes, Rob James-Collier as Barrows and Lesley Nicol as Patmore, the cook are supplemented by many other fine performances.

Jullian Fellowes is the main author of the plot and story and brings a touching reality with both sadness and joy to the actions and dialogue.",1482019200,,1292,4.912844036697248

Once I started- I couldn't stop. I binged watched every episode just in time for season 4.

The writing is amazing. The cast and crew has done such lovely work and I now beg that everyone at least try to watch at least the first episode.

Lots of emotions. Loving relationships.

The cast is a truly great array of characters, and I have enjoyed this series from start to finish & have found that the UK version is THE BEST. Here in the states, we received an edited version of the series, so it was a pleasure to look at the Original UK Versions... When acting and writing come together, and it's THIS GOOD, how can I possibly complain? It's SHEER PERFECTION caught on screen. A perfect blend of those who are born into privilege and those who are born into service. The twist and turns in the series is just wonderful. I am happy every time I catch it on T.V., or put in my Dvd.  I love that Amazon has the series to watch whenever the mood strikes.",1482019200,8,769,4.1610738255033555

4274450,5,B0046ZT40W,"Downton Abbey is by far the best television series ever made. My Husband and I have enjoyed it immensely and everyone I know who has watched feels the same. To say we were deeply disappointed that Season 6 came to an end is severely understated. We are hoping that Downton Abbey will be made into a movie as we are desperate Downton Abbey fans.

If I am correct I believe Downton Abbey was watched in 200 different nations/countries; need I say more?

If you haven't seen Downton, do it! Start with Season 1 because there is a definite story line which weaves its way into your heart, plus, it is just too well done not to follow it precisely!

The costumes change with every era. (It is definitely a period piece by the way.) The cars are different as well. Oh, and the castles are unbelievable! The characters both ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" will cause you to be endeared to them or despise them. You will love Downton Abbey I guarantee it!

The cast is perfect, the acting is marvelous and the writing and story lines are phenomenal.  This time period is fascinating and watching each episode takes you back in time.  As an American, I did not know how the interaction between the different classes in England worked so as a history buff I felt like I learned something as well as being very entertained.  Also, I think that the shows produced in Britain are better overall than  those made in the U.S.  I guess That is why so many shows made in the U.S. are copied from shows in Britain.",1480809600,,697,4.3565891472868215

4274923,4,B0046ZT40W,"Downton Abbey is a very classy and beautiful show. It moves a little slow and does not have the typical drama and excitement that other shows tend to have. If tons of drama and intrigue is what you are looking for, it is probably not the show for you . If you are looking for a relaxing and peaceful show with a beautiful scenery that takes you away to a time gone by, then this is the show for you. Downton Abbey is like a cup of hot coco on a cold winter night.",1480636800,,463,3.9361702127659575

4275015,1,B0046ZT40W,"What a load of RUBBISH! Bad acting by EVERYONE bar the only two characters who in my opinion, had credibility were John Bates (played by Brendan Coyle), who is mainly known as Mr Bates or just Bates, is Lord Grantham's valet and Robert Crawley, The 7th Earl of Grantham (also known as Lord Grantham) (played by Hugh Bonneville).
I'm from England and my associated family history dates back to 1066. Our family history is extremely well documented. My family in England, Scotland and Ireland have owned large Estates and had staff like those seen in Downtown Abbey. This series has been totally geared to the American audience.
Yes, the buildings, the estates and gardens are magnificent, are as the costumes as they are the ONLY things actually REAL.
 BUT PLEASE - the dialogue and plot lines are so weak!!! The political correctness is so nauseating it's a joke and absolutely not true of the real relationship that would have existed between a Master/Mistress of the House and his/her servants when it came to the rest of the actors and household staff portrayed in this series.
Totally weak garbage. Absolutely hated it and won't bother with the rest of the disc or series. I will donate my copy to the local library as it's absolute torture just even seeing the cover on my DVD shelf.",1479513600,,1288,4.75

Programs are so thoughtful and enjoyable  I knew from the day the series Downton Abbey was publicied that it would be a ""topper"".  We Americans can't get enough of our ""Mother Country's"" literature and theater.  Well, that is one person's opinion anyway. In my humble opinion, I must say the Brits know how to do it.",1476403200,,395,4.52112676056338

4275858,5,B0046ZT40W,"I love watching Downton Abbey, not only because it appears to be so authentic (I actually don't know, because I did not live during that time period), the acting, production, story lines are so detailed and captivating, but because it takes me away to feel as if I am there.  My grandparents, immigrants from Ireland and Norway about 1915, and met here in the U.S. when they were employed as the chauffeur and cook fat a mansion in St. Paul, Minnesota. Watching the intricate personality developments of each of the domestic/servant staff makes me think of my grandparents and what it may have been like for them.

4275861,5,B0046ZT40W,"Quite a cast of characters. Has many unexpected story plots that flow along with the historical time period.  Costuming and sets are flawless.  When this first came out I attempted to watch episodes sporadically; however, it was difficult to follow without knowing the intricate character developments that evolve each episode.  So being able to see the whole season in short time frame is much more enjoyable.  Characters have great depth with the events of history, especially WW1, making this much more than a parade of parties in a rich household. Imagine the daily drama possibilities of living in one building, however large, with 20 or more other people.  That's a small village...and a lost way of life.",1476403200,2,711,5.042735042735043

4275864,5,B0046ZT40W,"I did not expect Downton Abbey to interest me. I thought it would be like most of the upstairs/downstairs shows I have seen through the years. I resisted watching for a long time despite all my friends who love it so. Well, I finally gave in and watched the first episode. I was hooked. I like shows where people make the unselfish choice and the drama is not of their own making all the time. In Downton Abbey wrong choices are made but people learn from them and become better for it. The staff and the family are separate in some ways but they are also like a big family and are involved in each other's lives. It is set in the early part of the 1900s around WWII and we see how the war changes the culture of England. I recommend watching it.",1476403200,,746,4.1875

The writing (thank you Julian Fellowes}, cast members {world class actors, all!), beautiful period costumes and gorgeous Highclere Castle transported me into another time and place.

The sacrifices that were made, to keep their properties, titles and history that their ancestors built.  Excellent portrayals and wonderful actors who represent their part of the story. If you enjoy English portrayals during period eras of history, are curious how an English Estate was kept, held and ran, from the Lord of the Estate, to the staff who helped them run and keep the Estate intact.

I wish there were more series like this on television.  The time period, location,

interesting. Wonderful acting and great stories are missing in other television
programs today and this series does not need nudity and violence to have
become one of the most popular programs on TV in years.

4276183,2,B0046ZT40W,"This show is like a book where the sentences are better than the paragraphs, the paragraphs are better than the chapters and the chapters are better than the book as a whole. The scenes are wonderful. But the plot is so poorly developed and contrived so as to make suspension of belief impossible even if you desperately want to like this show.

For example, Bates plans to go to London to kill the rapist of his wife Mr Green. But he decides at the last minute not to go. Then that same exact day Mr Green just happens to die mysteriously, making it seem Bates is guilty. And this is the second time in like a year that Mr Bates is wrongly accused of murder.

Furthermore, many of the characters are pathetically one-dimensional and cliche'. Nobody can believe the character of Thomas for example. These characters and the plot development become so unbelievably predictable after watching just a few episodes.

I can't help but feel that this is a result of the arrogance of the writer thinking he as one person could write the whole show. Most shows use teams of writers and you can really tell the difference here. If he had gotten some more help and advice he would have have a much bigger and richer pool of ideas to draw from and would not have to present all the characters as so one-dimensional and the plot turns so contrived and predictable.

But I love the scenes and the lines and the costumes and all the details. It's just how those details are assembled that is an utter disaster with this show.

It's funny to me how many excuses people make for the bad writing of this show simply because they are mesmerized by the English accents and antique furniture. It's just a half-baked soap opera really.",1475280000,,1714,4.533980582524272

4276191,5,B0046ZT40W,"It is a compelling story line, but it is as close to the lifestyles of the people during that time as All My Children is to American lifestyles today. Yes, I know they have an ""expert"" informing them how elaborately and meticulous usly the table setting was. He also advises them on the dress, and a lot of other details we could have garnered from a photograph.
  What's accurate: The close relationship between the dressing servant and the aristocrat. Although there was probably true affection, the barriers were very established and followed; The dinner upstairs for the aristocrats, in which they dressed formally, and had only polite conversation; the coming to attention for the head servant; the rivalry between some and the deep friendship between other servants; aristocrats confiding deep secrets to the dressing servants, even secrets they wouldn't normally confide to one another; an aristocrat going broke and marrying a wealthy person without station just for the money; and a bunch more
  What's inaccurate: basically the same accident and vocabulary as the aristocrat, which were, in fact, so very different that one's station in life was ascertained by this; the romance between an aristocrat and servant -- in reality the servant would have been handled very aggressively, probably beaten by other servants, and a self-respecting father would go to extremes to keep the pair separated, including keeping her in her room. The rich and affectionate relationships between the aristocracy didn't even happened in America, much less England. The barriers between the classes could only be crossed by narrow, long, bridges, and then crossed again, as a permanent relationship was impossible. Servants didn't have the private or semi-private bedrooms, but usually had something much more like an an army open barracks, in which all the women slept in a large room and the same for men. Even though men and women labored together, they were very much expected to keep themselves apart; servants who married were often dismissed. Many hid marriage in what was no less than an open-secret-marriage. As long as the aristocrat wasn't flagrantly faced with it, everything might be fine. Although the men-to-women ration of house servants was fairly equal, there were tonnes of male property caretakers to flatter the females, and sometimes impregnate or marry them. The aristocrats might not be able to name half of them, or even recognize them. Downton Abbey would require lots of yards keepers, but I've not seen one.
  There are so many more. A person who wanted to know more could easily research it.",1475193600,,2610,5.143867924528302

Donwton Abby is nothing like this. It's a great show that has a lot of detail and care for it. I love the subtly in the gossip and tumors that go around the show and it's hard not to get involved and intersted with this show.

4276247,5,B0046ZT40W,"Have never watched any part of Downton Abbey previously. Did not know anything about it except that it was very popular. Was glued to the TV, entranced by the beginning of the series, and am happy to have the opportunity to watch the episodes in sequence without having to wait between weeks and seasons. (Am retired.) Am enjoying it very much, especially because this is the original as shown in the UK. Have never been there. Though this is a fictional work, there are many things which fit into the story seamlessly, things from actual historic events, and the behaviour of the classes of people, seems mostly like what would have happened at that time. Wonderful to see the years roll by and the changes in manners, acceptable behavior, food and dances, fashion. Best of all is the portrayal of the upper class and ""lower"" class folks adjusting to the changes that time and the speed of new inventions brought into their lives. Also, some historic attitudes about which i knew, but not in detail. Very enlightening. The story moves quickly without adding unneeded detail which would have slowed the pace. The author's knowledge and expression of human nature is superb. The actor's are top drawer. Interesting insertions of ""guest performers"" made some episodes even more interesting. All the performers are star quality and add the icing on the cake of this fantastic creation! Kudos, too, to the whole company which made this happen, from camera men, people who controlled the lighting, stunt people, and all the many persons whose expertise contributed to this glorious production.",1475020800,,1588,4.973684210526316

If you want to see how the servants lived and served their ladies and lords, see this show.  It's a wonderful portrayal of life in the early English 1900's when no self-respecting gentleman and lady lived without at least a lady's maid and butler and valet and cook and chauffeur and etc.  This is such a beautiful program where you get to see the relationships that develop between the servants and between the family and between each other.  At times humorous, at times dramatic and at times may bring tears to your eyes.  However, it is never boring.  One my absolute all-time favorite programs.

Great show, Great Actors, Great sets, Great writer Julian Fellows. Glasses raised to toast you on the best ever of English shows. Loved and now miss it. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to step back in time to witness what life was like in my Grandmothers era. I do see the dowager as a similar example to my grandmother.

Very human in any era, I suppose.

4277094,5,B0046ZT40W,"I watched all the Downton Abbey seasons and episodes when they first appeared on PBS.  When Amazon Prime had all 6 seasons available to add to my ""watch list"", I was thrilled.  I have started watching them again...it's called ""binge watching"" now.  I look forward to watching every episode and every season for the next few days.  Cannot imagine anyone not being aware of this great serial.  It is beautifully filmed and the acting is outstanding with a cast of notable actors...Elizabeth McGovern, Dame Maggie Smith, Brendan Coyle, Michelle Dockery and others.  Seeing how the old manors in England were decorated, kept running smoothly by the staff and seeing the beautiful costumes of the era (s) is so interesting.  There is drama galore but also some comedy thrown in.  Anyone who loves period films and good drama will love this production.",1473033600,,846,4.950354609929078

4277608,5,B0046ZT40W,"This is the second time I watched it. I realized even more so than before how well the script is written and how well the actors deliver it. The acting is simply superb....no overacting, in fact very often it is very calm and understated. It's very interesting to see how the aristocrats made such an effort to maintain a distance from the service personnel and at times were unaware of the demands they placed on them. Yet at other times they would be  exceptionally kind and understanding of the problems, personal and health related, of the servants. Downton Abbey belongs to an era long gone and by today's value system unacceptable. But the story line(s) and the characters are so believable. I will continue to watch this excellent production all the way through for the second time. I recommend it highly.",1470787200,2,812,4.75886524822695

I can't turn it off, it has made me late for all my deadlines as it consumes my attention like nothing has in a while.  I love so much about it from the turn of the century protocols to the juicy subplots in between. There isn't a character that I don't believe and Mary could say anything to me good or bad as long as I get to hear her voice.

Mostly about the wait staff and all the daily goings on around ""Downton Abbey""...the lord of the Abby is dealing with finding an heir to the legacy of the abbey by having to find suitable men to marry his daughters and it keeps getting derailed...pretty good show with no foul language or inappropriate sex scenes etc...good clean television...",1470787200,,675,4.42741935483871

It so irritating to watch a show that has the facts confused or just made up.  Downton Abbey does an excellent job at getting the facts correct.  The show has all the details nailed down from the clothing, the food, the house, and the social hierarchy.

The sisters ruining each other's lives, and the servants often the same, just for the sake of bringing others down to their level, or for jealousy, is annoying.

4278306,5,B0046ZT40W,"The first season of 'Downton Abbey' is a smashingly wonderful aberration.

It's a soap-opera which avoids of all of the cheesiness that is the staple of soap-operas. It's a period-piece that dodges all the conventions into which such historical productions fall. It's intensely, complexly, and almost too populously character-driven. Yet it's also plot-driven, to say the very least, considering that one episode of 'Downton' on average equals about 3 episodes of most other serial dramas.

I'd avoided the show for so long because I'd assumed it was just another period drama disguising the conventional and simplistic political and social views held by so many writers and filmmakers. Well, 'Downton' is the complete opposite of that. Certainly, the realities of English aristocratic life are showcased without sugar-coating; there is a CLEAR social difference between hired servants and recognized aristocracy. But the complex (there's that word again) reality of that life was that ALL of those people belonged to families, just not the nuclear families that post WW2 Westerners recognize as the norm, which is why we so erroneously think of that time in ways that are inaccurate and cliche. 'Downton' attempts to dispel that perception.

And one of it's greatest strengths is in the marriage of the performances to the writing, which I personally attribute to the English mastery of subtlety. Not a moment is wasted in the narrative, because so much of the cold text itself--like the performances themselves--is understated, forcing the viewer to muse over the subtle ambiguity left hanging there, which is the hallmark of good writing anyway.

I fully recommend 'Downton Abby.' For the above-mentioned reasons, you don't even need to binge this show; a single episode is enough to leave you breathless. Go check it out.",1468972800,,1825,5.2827586206896555

I refuse to watch series such as this. It is nothing more than propaganda to promote the desensitization of moral values.

I have discovered over the years that England, tradition, and civility are just three words that mean the same thing. That as we measure time in decades (50's, 60's etc.) the English measure time in centuries. Something that I love about them. Downtown Abbey with the characters and place provide us with a great and wonderful peek into past centuries. The acting is superb and the story lines are crafted as a beautiful English sweater is crafted, with the finest epilogue country has to offer. My only criticism is that the characters repeat the same indiscretions over and over without learning anything while the aristocrats often seem clueless. A condition which I believe portrays the English people in a serotype that is neither kind nor accurate.",1466899200,4,952,4.882716049382716

The cast is terrific, delivering performances that inspire drama, empathy and well placed humor as they portray a compelling story that draws you into their world. From the father who is trying to secure his families future, sibling rivalry run amok, a dysfunctional relationship with a stuffy but very amusing mother-in-law, and an interloping third cousin, to the infighting and politics of the house staff, the myriad of story lines keeps your interest throughout.  There are so many characters that it all seems a bit much for the first few episodes.

Very interesting, and highly visual, perspective on the birthright social class structure that existed in Great Britain in the early 1900's.  The series serves as a complementary adjunct to reading Ken Follett's Century Trilogy which starts at approximately the same point in time on the eve of WWI (Fall of Giants) and equally serves as a strong counterpoint to the class and characters depicted in ""Call The Midwife"".",1466208000,,507,5.023809523809524

It is my break and reason to get off my feet for an hour or two of pure delight.  The author, the producer, the setting, while very dated is not much different from the people around us today, I see Bates in a friend named Richard, I see the cook in another friend fearful of every new invention, they are all so true to their character and show us a wonderful display of history and human nature.",1465344000,,670,4.301587301587301

What a great story, or should I say stories within the story as it is seen from many perspectives. From the so called upper crust to the lowly parlor maid. Each episode has an exciting plot, whether unexpected death or the every day workings of the household, to keep you wanting more. I think what sets it apart from the run of the mill period pieces is the seeming reality of day to day living and and the in depth characters. I certainly recommend it to everyone, even if you don't normally watch this type of show",1464825600,,632,4.319327731092437

4280465,5,B0046ZT40W,"I'd heard a ton of people talk about this show. For some reason I thought it was one of those British comedy shows. I downloaded it for a long trip and when it began I instantly thought.. This isn't anything I'm going to be interested in because of the setting and time period.

In the first episode I began to get interested in the characters. It wasn't long before I wanted to begin the next episode immediately right after! It was one of those shows for me.

It's The type of show where it's really neat to get a glimpse on what it was like for different classes of people in the early 1900s. You really get invested in the characters and their particular story lines and for me, that's really important to really get into a show. You root for them, you feel sad for them, you laugh, and you can't wait to see what happens next.

I was told (and I feel it'll be the case for me) once you finish it.. You really miss the show and the characters. So that says a lot about the quality of this show.",1463961600,,998,4.160621761658031

4280546,5,B0046ZT40W,"early in the show, the characters established themselves, not just as individuals but also as examples of the mores of the times. The only one I found irritating is Cora...much too soft spoken. However, I am making this comment based on  more modern personalities. She is strong for her daughters, and brings a more ""American"" attitude in her dealings with the downstairs staff, which wins her friends and also scorn. All the characters, even the delightfully crusty Dowager, will grow and learn as the shows continues thru all 6 seasons, and all will be missed.

This is my third time working my way through all 6 seasons, and each time it's well worth it, even if suddenly it's 3 am, and it's ""just one more episode""",1463788800,3,718,4.690476190476191

Of course they have English accents which I usually find pretty charming, but in this case, I had a difficult time understanding what they were saying.  Following the plot took a lot of concentration, but it was slow moving enough that I could pretty well put it all together.  The difficulties I had with it were mostly due to my own slight hearing problem and somewhat lack of attention.  Those of my friends who liked this show were great fans and followed it through all of the episodes.

4280742,5,B0046ZT40W,"I've heard some people say how much they love this show, but I could never get the time to sit down to watch (this is coming from a fan of Walking Dead and Game of Thrones).  But I finally did!

It takes a few minutes to get into it, but once you are in, you are hooked.  I like how the first episode starts with an American tragedy and I like that one of the family is an American - so that Americans have an investment in the English family also.  There are a few English terms that Americans would probably cock their head to and wonder what that means, but you get the jist of it.

Downton Abbey doesn't have the roar and hellfire like Walking Dead or Game of Thrones, but (surprisingly there is one actor on Downton that moved onto Game of Thrones!) you do end up liking the characters and want the best for them, therefore it pulls you into their story.",1463356800,,859,4.150602409638554
4280743,5,B0046ZT40W,I had been wanting to watch Downton Abbey since the beginning of the series but somehow I always managed to miss it on the local PBS station. I was really happy to see that I was going to be able to watch what I had missed with my Amazon Prime membership. One episode and I was hooked and am totally enjoying the episodes as they unfold.

4280846,5,B0046ZT40W,I'm watching the series for the second time and enjoying it all over again. It's an engaging period piece with great stories and fully-developed characters - what's not to like? Dame Maggie Smith is a delight as the Dowager Countess. The writers have created a perfect vehicle for her and she delivers like the pro that she is. I love watching the introduction to all the characters the second time around and am discovering things I didn't remember seeing first time around. I love Downton Abbey; it's truly a Masterpiece Classic.,1463097600,,531,4.846153846153846

From the first episode we learn what the overarching trouble will be with the series as a whole - the entail which is going to cause the family to forfeit the estate to a distant relative - but we also get intriguing subplots and a view of a complex society-within-the-estate, here revealed in its many layers of nuance and subtlety, not a simple master-servant relationship at all, but, increasingly as modernity overtakes their lives, the sense of people holding on to an entire way of life in which everyone, from top to bottom are in their own way equally important.",1462492800,,613,4.675925925925926

Also it looks like the aristocracy is unable to dress themselves, cook for themselves and clean up after themselves.  The interactions between servants is well worth watching as is seeing how kind the Lord and Lady of the Abbey are to their staff. I love seeing the costumes etc.  I think the worst is yet to come as the country goes to war.  I have several episodes to watch to get caught up and this will keep me quite entertained for weeks to come.

4281386,1,B0046ZT40W,"There are other choices that are good wholesome movies. A one star is not unrealistic at all (like I've seen written in some comments), because if they'll have sexual immorality at the end of the 1st season, then there's more immorality to come and as I gather it from other reviews, the immoralities do not stop there, so it is not just about giving one star for one scene.  I'm well aware that watching it will not turn one gay (as I've seen some state in their comments).. that comment really is such an immature, preconceived notion about us one-star reviewers of this film. It just so happens to be that some of us one-star reviewers knows what it means to truly NOT be a hyprocrite and stand fast in our beliefs and not compromise our faith.  It does not, in no way, mean that we (true christians) hate gay people, it means we don't condone the sin, in which it was first called wickedness in the book of Genesis (the city of Sodom). It's just straight, truthful, facts, not hatred.  There are some christians who do wrongfully hate people, but I speak for us Christians who do not hate the person, just the sin, and rightfully so, as God's Word explains to turn away from sin, but yet we are hated for standing up for the Truth.  For the people that's watched this movie, they've missed out on doing something good with their time, instead of subjecting their souls to moral corruption. It's not entertaining, to say the least. I know how easy it is to make excuses. I've watched other less mild shows with the same subjects that had come up. But I chose to watch it & I was terribly wrong for that! So, you see, everyone makes mistakes & I definitely don't act like I'm better..I just know better & even true christians fall. It all just depends if you're ignorant of the truth or not. Sometimes you'll fall & sometimes you can say, ""no way"" & stand happy in the eyes of the Lord, blameless. Glad I passed this one up!...with God's help, of course!..because I can be a sucker for period dramas! ",1461715200,3,2003,4.432065217391305

Today when there are so many movies that feel violence, sex and everything in between is what brings ratings in, this proves those critics wrong.  It is filled with stories that all lead to one thing-- no matter how intertwined, no matter what flaws, and no matter what obstacles, family, blood or not, will prevail with the support of each other.  It is wonderfully written, the actors are magnificent and I'll be sad to see it end.  BBC/PBS you did it again--another beautifully made series!  Kudos!",1461024000,,559,4.721649484536083

4281986,5,B0046ZT40W,"I believe one of the things I love the most about Downton Abbey is that it isn't a typically feminist (as all movies, and television both are today) which sees everything from a male-oppressor-female-oppressed pov. Far too often we find that mainstream feminist literature cannot discuss issues which affect men without reminding them that they're still somehow over privileged and that their issues are less serious than women's issues. Downton Abbey is unique in that it talks about and critiques the issues women face/faced, but doesn't sideline the issues that us men face. Men are also victims of emotional/domestic abuse(e.g. Mr Bates and his wife), men are expected to be strong and brave, and ""'wimpish"" men(nice guys) who don't conform to contemporary Anglo-Saxon notions of masculinity are despised and marginalized by our society.(e.g. William who is given a white feather of cowardice for not joining the army) Also, men are not simply emotionless drones who are utterly devoid of feelings. We too are living, breathing human beings, but not like Mary is aware of that in the way she treats Matthew in the beginning. She's pretty horrible to him, isn't she. Not only is she extremely sarcastic to him (""yes, I agree the whole thing is one big joke"") despite his genuine apology for what he said, she also subtly insults him at the dinner table, comparing him to a ""sea monster"" of Greek tragedy. Later, to rub salt into the wound, she tells him, ""Oh you know what? I really do like you; But um, we'll have to wait and see if mom's baby is a boy. Until then I can't promise you anything."" (the message is that he's simply a moneybag and nothing more and that she doesn't REALLY like him, she only wants to marry him for respectability and a patriarchal inheritance). Most people don't know how hurt men can get at these kinds of things, and Downton Abbey does a splendid job at illustrating the fact that men too have fragile feelings that can be hurt, men need to be able to express their vulnerability, to have a shoulder to cry on, or they'll resort to other, destructive ways to channel their emotions (e.g. Matthew joining the army and going off to war). We need more writer's, and producer's to follow the path of Downton Abbey, to give men a fleeting chance of respectability in the eyes of the entertained world of today.",1459468800,,2340,4.7518427518427515

4282007,5,B0046ZT40W,"Every character in Downton Abbey is brilliantly cast and even more so brilliantly acted.  If you enjoy watching productions whose main focus is human interest then this is the series for you.  The interaction among the members of the staff and among the members of the family as they take you through what it was like to live that life and how superbly they portray the demeanor and etiquette of that era is acted so naturally that you feel as though you are there with them.  Every one of them is so genuine.  I would find it hard to chose a favorite.

If you need car crashes and things being blown up and all other sorts of shock-value violence you should definitely not choose Downton Abbey for this show is not about special effects, it's about real acting.",1459382400,5,762,4.492753623188406

This is a story about the Earl of Grantham, his family and the servants. This is a big cast and  every one has an intricate story that interweaves with the others.  These are three-dimensional characters that will keep you coming back to see what happens next. The story, set in the early 1900's, is true to the time with even the smallest detail accurate.

The setting in Highclere castle is so magnificent and as you watch, although it is fiction, it is a part of history. The styles are wonderful and watching them change as the world changes as well makes you feel part of history. You watch it unfold as people become more equal and women decide to work. I love other series, but this is something you literally could give to your grandmother and sit there watching it with her. I give Downtown Abbey Season 1 through 5, 5 stars.

4282655,5,B0046ZT40W,"....you don't have to wait for months and months to enjoy the next season/series.

Okay, I'll admit. I could care less about snooty high society. And to be perfectly frank- I'm part of the 99%. So for a long time I felt that a show about a ruling class family facing their burdens and traumas would be too much schmaltz for my taste.

I got a lot of recommendations for this show, though. So I tried to watch once about 6 months ago, and I couldn't get into it. But it seemed to have all of the elements that I would find entertaining. It is deeply layered, the dialogue is amazing, it is very well acted, and someone was well paid to monitor the details of the details within the details.
The plots are soap opera drama, but once I was hooked I could care less. I did need a little help to get hooked, however.
If you are a late-comer to the hype like I am, then here's a few pointers...
Amazon Prime offers the Original UK Version. Watch this one. I hear there are other versions that were chopped to pieces. I wouldn't want to touch them.
Next- don't start from the middle. That was my mistake at first. I tried to just pick up what ever season landed in my recommended feed one day and that did not work out at all. Start from Season 1, episode 1, because context is everything.
I watched the first episode twice, actually. I had to open up Wiki and look up characters and definitions for things like a legal ""entail"". And before I did this, I watched the Alastair Bruce special that explained all of the manners and culture. It was like a crash course.
That gave a kick-start where it was needed. Looking at these estates as micro-economies was extremely interesting.
I knew a little of the history because it is an area that I've researched for antiques and genealogy. But I was completely ignorant of historic English aristocracies. I've had a great time binge-watching this, and comparing to my history books.

I think this show has some fun for people that enjoy antiques. You will have fun seeing familiar sewing machines, clocks, lighting, kitchen ware, furniture, etc.
I knew some of the actors and I really deeply enjoyed the introduction to the actors that I didn't know. It has me looking for other shows that they have moved on to. I might wind up with a collection of British TV pretty soon.",1458518400,,2308,4.438679245283019

Its been a very long time since I was captivated by a particular movie or TV series. Ive become serious on matters of God and truth that Ive forgotten many pleasures, TV in particular. Far too long and in-between 40-years have I eagerly watched a show that entertained all my senses with pleasure as Downton Abbey. It actually brought me back to the life of authentic wealth, beauty, love, truth, morals, values, forgiveness, humanness, and sustains me with the people around me. I feel blessed, supported, and comforted with morals that always meant so much to me. I know Im not alone anymore, caring so deeply about others in my life, in a very good way.

4282756,5,B0046ZT40W,"Ok. This series would not be my first choice. For some reason, my wife likes those English period pieces where the heroine takes long, emotive walks across the moors so I was outvoted for the night's entertainment. I was surprised that I liked it!

It starts with a view of the preparations by the downstairs staff for the upstairs owners. Lordy, wake me when it is over. Then the Titanic sinks, the owners face the loss of the ancestral home, the elder sister emotionally eviscerates the middle sister, the socially conscious Lord of the manor maintains face, the servants plot and Dame Maggie Evans upstages everyone with an upraised eyebrow and moue. This in the first 15 minutes. After that the servants conspire against each other, dividing into camps that support the owners or resent the owners. Yet you find yourself liking all the downstairs people, even the cads. There is social ranking among the servants - the butler, who has his own backstory outranks the valet who has his own backstory, who outranks the first footman, who outranks the second footman and so own. It is an interesting and funny demonstration of English gentry at the turn of the century.

Did I say funny? Yes. Maggie Smith  (she was professor MacGonigal in Harry Potter) as the mother of the Lord of the manor gets to make pithy and acerbic comments on every situation. She is the highlight of the show. The elder daughter rebels against plans to marry a distant relative, has an affair with a Turkish under-ambassador who promptly dies in her bed, forcing elder daughter, mother and upstairs maid to carry his body from her bedroom to his guestroom, which is witnessed by the assistant cook and scullery maid. A new valet with a limp has the protection of the Lord of the manor despite the misgivings of the American wife, the very proper Butler and the conspiratorial staff including the first footman who wanted the job and gets pretty sneaky in trying to acquire it. This was the first episode. Glad I stayed awake.  The only complaint I made ( I couldn't let my wife know I liked it) was there was no gratuitous shooting and fistfights. Then the first season ends with the start of World War I.

Summary: I loved it. Watched it. No matter what your expectations are, humor, action, historical drama, Dallas-like plots, you will find it. Even the walk across the moors was interesting.",1458259200,,2372,4.733656174334141

I found it disturbing that it had to be shown in such an unsubtle manner and rather odd, considering this day and age, that the first homosexuals, and as far as I know the only ones, represented in the series were villainous.

I've been wrong before and I am wrong again!! It really is excellent and a pretty accurate depiction of class differences and the sense of responsibility that each segment of society feels about maintaining the structure that keeps relationships stable safe and dependable. The acting is so exceptional that there is no feel that the story is being acted. Very hard not to watch.

NOW that the series has come to an end on TV, I am so happy to have the opportunity to watch it all over again....I am now on Season 3 with a modified ""binge watching""  schedule :)  The actors are great and the characters they play are wonderful...Maggie Smith is the best and some of her ""one liners"" are so funny.  A beautiful ""Upstairs"" aristocratic  family that is kind, caring,  and respectful to their ""Downstairs"" staff...they are like one extended family both Upstairs and Downstairs.

4283627,4,B0046ZT40W,"As a major fan of ""Upstairs Downstairs"" (UD) I was more than amused at the similarities I saw in ""Downton Abbey"" (DA), and even what at times was very close to outright plagiarism.  I'm a little surprised the producers of UD did not complain or at least protest.  But while the writing and cast on DA was not up to UD's lauded standards, the production values, thanks to HD digital video, were of course vastly superior.  DA is a well-dressed period soap-opera, but then so was UD.  By comparison to UD, DA's script is perhaps sometimes thin and at other times a bit over the top, but then it is soap opera and who doesn't love a good soap opera?  For me I preferred the cast of UD as a whole though there are plenty of good performances on DA as well, especially Maggie Smith.  For those who have never seen UD I highly recommend they give it a go, though I warn them the video and even audio quality of the old video-on-tape is by comparison to DA pretty bad.  But if you watch UD you will see the roots of DA and understand my review a little better.  You will also see one of the most beautiful actresses ever to appear on the screen, Nicola Pagett.  And don't forget the 2012 renewal of UD, which was pretty good as well.",1457308800,,1226,4.25

4283850,5,B0046ZT40W,I never bough into the hype of Downton.  Season 6 episode 2 happened and I had to start from Season 1 Espisode !... I cannot stop.  It is sooo good.  a great find!!!!!,1456963200,,167,4.0
4283851,4,B0046ZT40W,"Good. Very good. However, by the time I watched halfway through the 2nd season, I had seen enough. I believe this series is better watched a little at a time instead of trying to do a marathon. The episodes started feeling too contrived, too melodramatic ( a good melodramatic) just too much for me to go back to the rest of the series. I actually felt ashamed that I spent so many hours watching it. I like the tragic characters, but this felt too soapy. I think if it had been described as a soap opera, I'd have not even checked it out.
I must say I am detoxing from Doc Martin- I just LOVE that series. Maybe I'll have to pick up DA another time when Im 'clean'.",1456963200,,666,4.170542635658915

4284045,4,B0046ZT40W,"The first time I saw one of the episodes I was disgusted with it, and changed the channel because it is just a soap opera. Then I realized it was filmed in a real mansion of the period, which is still lived in, so I watched all the seasons to see how the upper class lived in elegance, and because it was filmed in a real mansion. After viewing some historical videos about the plight of the people of that time period, I think the show was probably fairly accurate in portraying the jealousies of the household, upstairs and downstairs, but I also think it portrays the life of the servants in a much more pleasant manner than such people were actually treated, and certainly they did not show how hard a servant had to work in those days.  I very much doubt that most ""elite"" were as kindly to their servants as this family was portrayed.  However, they were giving us a look into a time when a lot of change was happening.  People were transitioning from mainly servant status to being more independent, probably as a result of the elite finding it difficult to afford to continue to ""live like kings.""  Isn't it strange how society changes over the years?  All in all, if viewed as a slice of history, with a grain of salt, it was a good watch.",1456876800,,1248,4.362068965517241
