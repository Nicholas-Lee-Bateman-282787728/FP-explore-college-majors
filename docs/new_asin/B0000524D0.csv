1388121,1,B0000524D0,"This video is Not Disney quality. It animation was obviously computer generated and got even silly in some scenes where the dogs face was ""messed up"" by the computer. And the Siamese Cats did not look like the cats in the original movie - and they were major stars in that one.
I am a MAJOR fan of Lady and the Tramp, I watch it several times a week for years now. (ok I am a bit obsessive with it).  But I could not even sit through this video - the songs were awful, the plot was - I think just making songs, and it was not in the style of the old movie.  In the original, you never saw ""Jim dear"" or ""Darlings"" faces - there was a reason for this - it made them inclusive to the public. Well in this video, you see all the faces.
Final point, the movie was a cross between, the Billy Joel - Oliver & Company, A Little Mermaid, and the Lion King.  All good movies, but put them together and Junk (and not junk yard dog).  Disney should not have made this the sequel to such a great movie.  Or if they were, they should have put more effort and love into it.  It was not here.",984441600,5,1077,3.962962962962963
1388122,4,B0000524D0,"I thought this was surprisingly good for a Disney sequel. Tramp's son, Scamp, yearns to be a ""wild dog"" and sets out stubbornly to do so. Along the way we see many backgrounds from the first 'Lady and the Tramp'. Old characters are seen as well, from the Siamese cats to old Trusty and Jock. The plot itself is pretty good and goes along nicely. The only time your interest might wane is during the songs which aren't very up to par. The 'Junkyard Rag' started off great, but could've been much better. The characters are great and I really liked Buster. He was sort of like Steele (Balto) and Scar (Lion King) combined. The other Junkyard dogs seemed to fade into the background though once the story gets rolling. Lady's three girl pups, however, are hilarious, and their voices are perfect. The only problems I had with this movie was: The boring songs. How quickly the Junkyard Dogs, (except for Buster,) found a home. The annoying Dog Catcher. When Buster sees Tramp again after all these years he hardly reacts. And Scamp's odd voice. I thought Scamp's voice should've been younger, he sounds more like a teenage dog than a pup. Not quite as good as the original, but I still recommend it. Disney seems to have gotten the ""hang"" of making sequels....let's see if they can keep it up.",984355200,,1289,4.584415584415584
1388123,4,B0000524D0,I thought that this movie wasn't as good as the origional lady and the tramp but that it was a very good movie as a whole. It is really cute with a very good message to it. I found it enjoyable to watch. This movie is definatly better than most disney sequels. It was worth the wait!!,983923200,,284,4.0
1388124,4,B0000524D0,"It has been 22 years since I saw Lady and the Tramp.  I think that helped me to enjoy this without comparing it.  As a lot of Disney stories do, this one has a moral.  I watched it with a 4 year old boy and his mother and we all enjoyed it.  It was cute without being sappy.  The opening sequence was a little ""gone with the windish.""  The voices were well chosen from mostly newer stars.  There were a few times where I actually laughed out loud from the antics.  If you want to see this to compare to the original, skip it.  If you want a family friendly story that most kids and parents can sit and enjoy together, get it.  I don't think you'll be disappointed",983836800,3,663,4.069767441860465
1388125,5,B0000524D0,"From some of the reviews that I had read on here it seems that a few of these people did not see the movie. I thought that the story was a bit choppy, but I thought that the Picture and sound were crisp. Scamp was simply adorable! He is a dog that is struggling to find his own path in life. He wants to be with the Junk Yard Dogs, but after the cruel treatment by the head dog. Scamp and the other dogs see that having a nice home to live in might not be so bad after all. Bad animation?!?! Come on!  The Amimation is top notch. I found it to be better then some of the last direct to video films. I hope that some of you will give the film a chance. Personally I think that it is a worthy successor to the original film.",983577600,3,722,3.8456375838926173
1388126,2,B0000524D0,"Cute movie, definitely not as good as the original though. Not nearly as moving or well put together. Younger children should get a laugh out of some of the slapstick kind of antics with the dog catcher. Adults will probably be cringing a little though.
One of the things I didn't like was the way they incorporated some of the songs. I really didn't like the Junkyard Dogs breaking out into some long, involved song. I fastforwarded through that the second time I watched it. Oh, and the opening song sequence was too much like Beauty and the Beast, with the townfolk walking around singing. Two of the songs were well done though.
The best parts of the film were the Angel and Scamp scenes. Angel is absolutely adorable with her tough exterior but hidden longing for a family, and if they come out with Angel merchandise, even at 22 years old, I will be the first in line to buy it! :) They even revisit Lady and the Tramp's walk through the park, and of course, there is spaghetti involved. But since Angel and Scamp are still young pups, look for sauce flying and spaghetti splattering everywhere instead of the refined meal that Lady and the Tramp shared once upon a time. The scene still manages to end very sweetly, with the two Italian chefs from the original movie looking on.
Worth watching just to see the cute, innocent, first puppy love that unfolds between Angel and Scamp. And the tension and eventual understanding that springs up between Tramp and Scamp is also well depicted. The other in-between stuff, especially the Junkyard Dogs and the dogcatcher, you just kind of have to suffer through. Or fast forward through.",983404800,9,1636,4.664359861591696
1388127,2,B0000524D0,"Let's see, first and most important, my children who love the original and generally enjoy the first showing of a movie, lost interest within 30 minutes.  Secondly, if you want a commercialized, rehashed, poor animated, short movie that gives you a warm & fuzzy because they chant the word ""family"" then this is for you.

1388252,5,B0000524D0,"I saw this movie when I was five years old, and I still watch it as an 18-year old. Maybe it's because I am a dog lover, or because I am a fan of Disney, but LADY AND THE TRAMP 2: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE is a fantastic and well-rounded movie, and the standout among the plethora of Disney Sequels released back in the early 90's mid 2000's. The characters are very easy to sympathize with, particularly the two main characters, Scamp and Angel. These two have fantastic chemistry, and are incredibly charismatic and well-acted, especially Angel, who is the shining moment of the movie, and that's pretty much an understatement. The tone is very consistent throughout the movie, the music is well orchestrated, the songs are very well-written and sound similar to the classic 90's Disney style, and the script and story, while predictable and run-of-the-mill, does a very good job at leaving the viewer satisfied, and doesn't come across as uninspired or corny. Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone, as this is pretty much THE LION KING of the Disney Sequels.

It has a poor storyline where they use the same theme from the old script and repackage it in the sequel that ruins this great classic.

1388287,4,B0000524D0,"Walt Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" is a classic animated film that has entertained generations upon generations since its theatrical release back in 1955.

But the idea for the film actually happened nearly 20-years prior when Disney writer Joe Grant came up with an idea to make a story built around an idea inspired by his Springer Spaniel named Lady, and how his dog was pushed aside upon the birth of his child.

In 1955, the film made its theatrical debut and was a enormous success in the box office.

Fastforward nearly 60-years-later and in 2001, ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" was released direct-to-video.  Directed by Darrell Rooney (who worked on animated series such as ""Smurfs"", ""Pac-Man"", ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"") and Jeannine Rousel (who worked on ""The Addams Family"", ""2 Stupid Dogs"", ""Captain Planet and the Planeteers"") and featuring a screenplay by Bill Motz and Bob Roth (both worked on ""The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride"", ""The Return of Jafar"", ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"").

The film would feature voices by Scott Wolf (""Party of Five"", ""Go"", ""V""), Alyssa Milano (""Charmed"", ""Who's the Boss?""), Chazz Palminteri (""The Usual Suspects"", ""A Bronx Tale"", ""Analyze This""), Jodi Benson (""The Little Mermaid"", ""Toy Story"" films), Bill Fagerbakke (""Coach"", ""The Artist"", ""SpongeBob SquarePants""), Bronson Pinchot (""Perfect Strangers"", ""Risky Business""), Jeff Bennett (""Enchanted"", ""The Replacements""), Cathy Moriarty (""Raging Bull"", ""Kindergarten Cop"") and Mickey Rooney (""National Velvet"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Boys Town"").

""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamo's Adventure"" is set in 1911 and Jim Dear is trying to give all of Tramp and Lady's pups a bath.  The two have three daughters who look like Lady and a mischievous son named Scamp who looks like his father.

Scamp loves playing with the baby but in the process, he ruins Jim's hat.  Jim gives Scamp a warning and Tramp tries to discipline his son but Scamp just wants to have fun.

After taking a bath, he gets muddy and messes up the entire living room.  Upset with Scamp, Jim feels that the only way to punish him is to have him stay outside in the doghouse and being chained.

While Lady and Tramp are saddened that Jim had to resort to punishing Scamp, they know he did it with best intentions.  Tramp tries to talk to his son, but Scamp is more interested in having fun and not live with a family.  Thinking life would be better to be free!

So, while he is chained outside, he sees a ruckus outside of the gate as a dogkeeper are trying to catch stray dogs.  Thinking that these dogs are having a lot of fun, Scamp manages to break through his chain and hang out with the stray dogs known as the Junkyard Dogs.

He befriends a young female dog named Angel and Scamp tries to join the Junkyard Dogs and feels that life away from a family is such a great life.  But in the process, the leader of the Junkyard Dogs, Buster, wants Scamp to prove his courage in order to join the group.  So, he has Scamp doing several tests and is amazed by Scamps ability.

While hanging out with the Junkyard Dogs, a dog named Sparky tells Scamp an exaggerated story about a legendary dog named Tramp who was able to avoid dozens of dog catchers and that he was looked up upon by the Junkyard Dogs but one day he disappeared.  Hearing the story, Buster gets upset and tells them that Tramp didn't die as a hero, he chose to run off with a female dog named Lady to become a house pet.  And Buster chose Lady over Buster and the Junkyard Dogs.

And right then, Scamp realizes that the stories of this legendary dog is his parents.

Shocked that his father was a Junkyard Dog, he can't believe that his father would leave this adventurous life to be a housepet.  But for Angel, she tells Scamp that her dream is to live with a family.  He doesn't understand why would anyone want to stay with a family, stuck in a house and having the same routine over and over.  But Angel tells him that she would choose living with a loving family than living on the streets.

Meanwhile, afraid for his son, Tramp hopes that he can find Scamp before he gets into trouble.

When Buster finds out that Scamp is the son of Tramp, Buster who has always had spite towards Tramp, figures why not try to take away his son from him.  So, when Scamp is asked if he rather stay with the Junkyard Dogs to have a life of freedom or to go back to his father and be stuck in a house and treated as a pet, which life will Scamp choose?

VIDEO:

""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  And make no doubt about this direct-to-video sequel, despite it not being a Disney animated feature film, the film is well-detailed when it comes to its scenery and objects, vibrant and looks great in HD.  If anything, despite being made in 2001, this film holds up incredibly well in 2012.  Not only does the film take the characters from the 1955 animated film and bringing them to the digital realm.

While the background scenery is well-detailed, the character designs are good.  A bit soft at times but for the most part, this film does look very good for a direct-to-video sequel.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The lossless audio track could have been better if it used the surround channels because most of the audio, I heard coming through the center and front channels only.  Even during the more action-based scenes, I didn't really hear the surround channels or LFE used as much.

With that being said, dialogue and music is crystal clear coming through the center and front channels but wished it was much more immersive.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" comes with the following special features:

  Puppy Trivia Tracks - While watching the film, you can watch with fun facts displayed onscreen.
  The Making of Lady and the Tramp II: From Tramp to Scamp - (16:34) The making of ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" and how the film came to be and the process of making the film.
  Sing-Along Songs - Featuring a sing-along (ala karaoke style) for five music tracks from the film: ""(Prologue) Welcome home"", ""World Without Fences"", ""Junkyard Society Rag"", ""I Didn't Know I Could Feel This Way"", ""Always There"".
  Disney Animated Shorts featuring Pluto - Featuring ""Pluto, Junior"" (7:08), ""Bone Trouble"" (8:42) and ""Pluto's Kid Brother"" (6:51).
  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary with director Darrell Rooney, animation director Steve Trenbirth and co-director/producer Jeannine Roussel.

EXTRAS:

""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of the film presented in 1:78:1 widescreen, English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to direct-to-video sequels, I know there are many parents who feel that these videos are primarily created for families and storylines that are safe and geared towards children.

For the most part, ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" is a family film that will no doubt entertain children and even those that are young at heart and grew up with the original ""Lady and the Tramp"" film.

And while most older Disney films never had a sequel, for any Disney fan who grew up with these films, you wonder to yourself, ""what if a sequel was made?"".

And for this sequel, while this is a film that I probably never expected a sequel being created, I was surprised back in 2001 but also excited because we get to see the characters brought into modern times using CG and different animation than its 1955 counterpart.

What I enjoyed about ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" is the continuing of the storyline from the first film.  At the end of ""Lady and the Tramp"", we watched as Lady had given birth to pups and the Dear family also welcoming a baby.  This time around, the pups are slightly older and the Dear's baby is now a young toddler who has bonded with the dogs.

And for the most part, the storyline works rather well because we get to see Lady and Tramp's children much older, we also see the Dear family having formed a strong bond with Lady, Tramp and the puppies but also seeing Scamp  exhibiting part of his father's mischievous behavior.  Granted, father Tramp is now much more mature and wants the best for his children, but Scamp wants to see the world.

It has that similarity to the first film when Tramp was trying to show Lady his free life and how much more adventurous life would be if she didn't live in the Dear home.  The same thing happens this time around but it's Buster and other dogs from the Junkyard who want to entice Scamp to leave his life of being a pet and living in a house, and have more adventure and freedom while living with them.

It's an accessible storyline that is easy for children to understand, fans who grew up watching the film to enjoy the film and its connection to the original ""Lady and the Tramp"" and most of all, seeing a sequel that is modernized and taking the characters and having a storyline that would appeal to a new generation.

With ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" being released on Blu-ray, the details of objects and scenery are well-detailed and despite being a direct-to-video sequel, by no means does it mean that this film is lower in quality.  The film despite being released in 2001 (and having a bit of softness), still looks great for a direct-to-video sequel, especially being released now in 2012, the film looks very good in HD, especially on Blu-ray.  Dialogue and musical scenes are crystal clear and for the most part, ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" looks and sounds good on Blu-ray!

And as for special features,  ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" comes with a making of, trivia, sing-along songs plus three bonus animated shorts featuring Pluto and more!

While ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" may not be as deep or dark as its 1955 counterpart, for a direct-to-video family animated film, the storyline is accessible, safe and entertaining and looks and sounds great on Blu-ray!

If you are a parent or a person who grew up watching the original ""Lady & the Tramp"", ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" is definitely recommended!",1354320000,,10496,4.714755896873286
1388288,5,B0000524D0,"Very cute story line. My 5 year old daughter loves to watch this one over and over, and defenatly loves the songs.",1353974400,,114,4.2272727272727275

1388291,3,B0000524D0,"Many of the Disney Direct-to-DVD releases feel like they're stretching the source material way past what it was meant to be. Did we really need a sequel to ""Cinderella,"" ""Peter Pan,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and other classic movies that ended with the phrase ""...and they lived happily ever after?"" These sequels should carry a tag line reading ""... But theeen...""

""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" is one of those movies. Revisiting it because of the recent Blu-ray release reminded me how gratuitous it feels throughout a short 70-minute running time.

Lady and the Tramp are the proud parents of three female pups and a scrappy dog name Scamp who has inherited a wild streak from his father. When his chain breaks after being sent outside for tearing up the house, Scamp runs off and meets the Junkyard Dogs. Seeking their approval, he goes through the leader's initiation process to become a member of the group. Could a spunky young pup named Angel help change his mind about wanting to live on his own away from his family?

The life lesson is definitely ""front-and-center"" in ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure."" Everyone needs to be part of a family. Another lesson Tramp gives Scamp is that you're always welcome home because family loves you no matter what. These are great lessons and do need to be emphasized. However, I start to wonder as I'm watching this movie how many orphanages or broken homes the producers of this movie have been to lately.

This isn't a bad movie by any means. The story is well-written and the voice cast performs wonderfully. The weakest points are the songs. They're bland and lackluster. If a Disney film is going to have musical aspirations it has a lot to live up to in the shadow of ""Snow White,"" ""Aladdin,"" and countless others.

The high-definition transfer looks and sounds excellent. The picture is clean and polished. It's so clear and crisp it removes any ""classic"" feel filmmaker's attempted to inject into it. Every musical number, line of dialogue, and background sound rings out through a fabulous 5.1 surround mix. It's too bad the songs are instantly forgettable.

Bonus material for this Blu-ray include ""'The Making of 'Lady and the Tramp II:' From Tramp to Scamp"" and three bonus shorts starring Pluto. There are sing-along songs, puppy trivia tracks, and more as well. Kids will find plenty of fun things to do after watching the movie.

Parents will find the ""Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure"" Special Edition Blu-ray needless. Their children will no doubt embrace it as much as they did the original. I'd say they have another success on their hands since that's why Disney makes these sequels. Just don't expect older fans of the original to feel the same way.",1347235200,,2749,4.823779193205945
1388292,5,B0000524D0,"To me ""Lady and the Tramp"" is a movie that is easily forgotten about but once remembered it is easy to get sucked into the story.  The tale of two dogs, opposite personalities, falling for each other and then in the sequel starting a family!  This DVD features the son of Lady and the Tramp, Scamp, and his mischievous adventures.  It is super cute and fun tale that is worth checking out.  My boys laughed and laughed at this DVD, and I admit I liked watching it with them.  It brings Lady and the Tramp to a whole new generation.",1347062400,,531,4.27
1388293,4,B0000524D0,"Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure seems a natural for a sequel, since Scamp himself was a popular comic book character for many years. The first movie laid some groundwork for Tramp's new life as a domestic dog.

The creators of the sequel emphatically yearned to recreate the magic of Walt Disney's 1955 canine family romance. For a art direction standpoint, they succeeded admirably. The background elements of Lady and the Tramp were mined for research and look almost exactly like the original. Animation poses were studied for accuracy. The degree to which these details were reached is worthy of celebration. This is one of the few sequels to feature an audio commentary (thank you!) and the folks involved were earnest indeed.

Perhaps more attention might have been given to the story (or, as in some corporate situations, perhaps it could have benefitted from less unnecessary meddling).

In hundreds of comics, Scamp was a cute puppy who got into mischief. For this film, Scamp is a lovable yet discontented adolescent (which distances him from some of the audience already). It's as if the script must undo something that was fine in the first film.

We get less time with our old friend Tramp (and even less with Lady, voiced by the heavenly Jodi Benson). In revisiting most of the same locations as the first story -- including the Italian restaurant, which is very clever -- the film can't keep from chewing its cabbage twice.

Still it's a pleasant film with very nice songs by the great Melissa Manchester and one of my favorite lyricists, Norman Gimbel (who worded ""A Whale of a Tale"" for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, a hit parade of TV themes and the excellent Pufnstuf movie score).",1346889600,,1709,4.839041095890411

There are definitely some great scenes in this movie and the underlying question of whether Scamp finally learns what it means to be a part of a family remains a secret until the end which kept my family guessing until the end. For me Scamp was my favorite character as he was fun loving and free, but also missing something in his life, which I believe we all are in some ways. With that in mind the writers do a great job to draw you into the movie making you want to find out what happens next. This was a great movie for the whole family!",1345075200,4,758,4.198630136986301

Yes, we all know everyone from the 90s and before had seen Lady and the Tramp. But of course in the 2000s, we should all know that not all of the Disney straight to DVD sequels rarely live up to their original film starter. But i'm here to tell you that this was a fun, entertaining and fun sequel to the original. Of course Tramp changed. Hello? He's a house dog and a father. Who wouldn't change their ways when they become a father? LOL Lady, in my opinion, is a little more calm in this one. She kinda bored me but watever, she had her spotlight in the original. Scamp was a fun lil puppy who learned good lessons and he was alot of fun to watch! He had me crackin up alot throughout this movie actually. The villain, Buster, was actually a decent villain. He wasn't dangerous or scary but he was definitely the leader. Angel was a tough, independent and adorable puppy who Scamp fell in love with. I absolutely love her and her fur color just makes her all the more beautiul.

Overall, the movie was great and i reccommend it to any Disney Animation lover and anyone who watched and enjoyed the original! :)",1317254400,2,1250,4.364806866952789
1388303,2,B0000524D0,"First of all, the opening song 'Welcome to our Little New England Town' or whatever is not a bad little number. But IMHO it would have been so much better if sung as part of the score, rather than by the townsfolk. (Seeing the policeman from the Zoo scene in the first movie bursting into song made my skin crawl). I guess Disney wanted to imitate the success of ""Beauty and the Beast"" with that 1991 classic's very well-done opening musical number, but in this case it was just corn with a lot of cheese.
A few more things that made me go 'Hmmmmm':
What was up with Jim Dear trying to teach Scamp about the American Flag as the Nation's symbol? Aren't dogs colorblind?
And Angel looks like she's a Chihuahua mix. And in the first movie, when the pound dogs are telling Lady of Tramp's past flames, Pedro the Chihuahua quotes, ""And my seester(sic)'Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua, I theenk.(sic)'.
Could Angel possibly be a former love child of Tramp's from that fling?!?
I also agree with other people that the pound dogs (at least some of them)from the first film should have been given brief 'cameo' appearances to show they found homes.
One thing I thought was clever: the lady who was always losing her wig was voiced by April Winchell, daughter of the late Paul Winchell. The credits show the character's name as Mrs. Mahoney--perhaps a nod to Winchell's ventriloquist puppet Jeff Mahoney?",1315526400,,1397,4.682926829268292

Their three daughters are mannerly little copies of Lady (they even love to be bathed!), but the only boy, Scamp (Scott Wolf), is definitely suiitably named.  In dog time he's a teenager, and heredity only exacerbates the difficulties of puberty--and it doesn't help that no one has ever told him of his father's days as a ""footloose and collar free"" street dog.  Scamp longs to be ""a real dog"" and live ""a life without fences,"" and when he falls in with Buster (Chazz Palminteri), leader of the Junkyard Dogs, he thinks he's found just what he's been looking for.  It bewilders him that pretty Angel (Alyssa Milano), who's fending off Buster's advances, longs for all the things he's happily left behind.  Then he learns the truth about his dad--and that Buster holds Tramp an old grudge.

Like so many direct-to-video Disney sequels, this one seems to lack an indefinable something.  All the cast--from Lady and Tramp to Jim Dear, Darling, and Aunt Sarah to Jock, Trusty, and Tony and Joe from the Italian cafe--are here, and the setting is faithfully recreated, but perhaps because of the rather strong humorous emphasis, it doesn't seem to work as well as the original.  On the other hand, it does have things to say about home, love, being open with your kids, and the temptation of gang culture (a motif all too apt in our day).",1304380800,,1728,5.374074074074074

I seen so many things wrong with it.
The bad:
 For one thing, Tramp and Lady had a personality turn around and I felt like they weren't like dogs but like humans. I loved both Lady and Tramp in the first because they had so much personality. They act like how dogs should act. I notice that Lady's design change too. In the first film she was way prettier yet in the second film, she looked less feminine.
I didn't like the 3 girl puppies and also there was no establish relationship shown with their brother Scamp nor their father. They just hated Scamp for no given reason. Also their voice acting was awful too. If they're suppose to be teenagers then they're voices should had been more mature not baby-like.
The Songs were awful accept for the one with Angel and Scamp!

The good things:
I love the Voice acting of Scamp, Angel, and the Junkyard dogs.
The only characters I liked in the movie were Angel and Scamp.

Something I felt Disney could had done:
 Disney should had made Lady and Tramp's puppies look mixed. At least design Scamp to have his mother's fur color with the white paws.

The music was good and the story had a good message.  I would highly recommend Lady & The Tramp I & II.  I have a day care in my home and the children love the two stories.",1290384000,,306,4.05
1388311,4,B0000524D0,"First, to correct some of the other postings here:  Even though it doesn't say so on the box, the 2006 DVD reissue of Lady and the Tramp II in fact DOES contain the same three Pluto cartoons that were on the earlier 2001 DVD release, including ""Bone Trouble"" (with the terrific Hall of Mirrors sequence!)

Secondly, this film is a lot better than most reviewers here believe.  It's unfair to compare it to the original, or any major theatrical release.  Let's compare apples to apples, and see how it stands up to other Disney direct-to-video Classic sequels, because that's what it is.  (Fantasia 2000 and Return to Neverland don't count because they were made as theatrical releases with more time, care and budget.)  Of the true direct-to-DVD films then, L&T2 may not be as popular as the Little Mermaid, Lion King or Beauty and the Beast sequels, but it has many powerful elements that make it a ""keeper.""

The classic rich look and gorgeous animation are completely faithful to the original.  The design of the new characters falls perfectly within that original style, convincing us that they inhabit the same world.  The background art is similarly detailed and evokes nostalgia, and the background music is similarly lush and wistful.  In short, it is a viscerally believable extension of the original film.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the case with all Disney sequels!

In L&T2, there are some beautiful moments when the picture moves beyond the level of plot into pure inspiration.  Among these are the ""World without fences"" sequence, the legend of Tramp besting twelve dogcatchers, and the railroad trestle chase.

And I love the concept of the story taking place before and on the Fourth of July, a lovely turn-of-the century day of picnics and parades.  It is this context that brilliantly underscores the conflict of Scamp declaring it his own day of independence, only to learn the importance of inTER-dependence of a family.

And the fireworks offscreen create flashes of colored light to dramatically illuminate the final fight scene between Tramp and Reggie in the Pound (prison).  Again, beautiful and inspired.  The film also includes some nice Miyazaki-influenced CGI work, notably the dogcatcher's wagon.

And for the record, the dogcatcher is NOT voiced by Don Knotts, but by Jeff Bennett doing his best Knotts impression.  After all, who would be a better model for the skinny inept dogcatcher than Barney Fife?

Watch it again with an open mind, and be prepared to be entertained!

1388312,3,B0000524D0,"Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure is one hour and ten minutes long and was released direct to video on February 27, 2001. Lady and the Tramp II is basically an opposite of the original Lady and the Tramp. The film picks up six months later were the original ended. Lady and Tramp are settled and now proud parents of four puppies of their own; three daughters and one son. The three daughters take after their mother and Scamp is a junior carbon copy of his dad. Tramp has grown accustomed to house life and has lost a little of his street wise smart. Scamp is a young pup who wants to be free with no rules, no baths, and no leashes. After Scamp gets himself chained to the doghouse for getting mud all over the house, he sees a bunch of dogs, with no collars on, running around in the street and mocking the local dog catcher. Scamp eventually breaks from his chain leash and goes searching for the dogs. Scamp runs into Angel and she introduces him to the Junkyard Dog gang. The Junkyard Dog gang is a group of stray dogs who are led by Buster. Buster is a mix of Rottweiler and Doberman pinscher. Buster was once Tramp protg and the two of them had a fallen out when Tramp fell in love and decided to become a house pet. Buster is unaware the Scamp is Tramp's son. Dogs of the Junkyard Dog gang do not think Scamp is cut out to be one of them because he is a house dog. Buster decides to put Scamp through some tests to see if he is worthy to belonging to their gang. The first test is to try to steal a can from a giant Bullmastiffs dog named Reggie. Scamp is almost successful until he knocks into a trash can and wakes up Reggie. Reggie gives chase and winds up getting capture by the city dog catcher. With the exception of Buster, the other Junkyard Dogs are grateful of what Scamp did. Afterward the dogs head to the park and it is there that Scamp learns that is his dad was once a street dog. It later that evening at the train station that Scamp and Angel begin to fall in love. The next day is Independence Day and the gang is back at the park. Buster is able to piece together that Scamp is Tramp's son. Buster set up a test to force Scamp to confront his family. Scamp must steal the family chicken and that mean Scamp must go up against his father. Scamp is able to steal the chicken but is given chase by Tramp. Scamp runs into an alley where he thinks he has evaded his father, but Tramp is able to out smart him. Scamp tries to leave but is unable to open the gate. This gives time for Tramp to talk to his son. Scamp tells him that he knows that he was once a street dog. Finally Buster and the Junkyard Dogs catch up with Scamp. Buster and the dogs try to convince Scamp to join them while Tramp tries to convince Scamp to go him with him. In the end Scamp join the Junkyard Dogs and a life on no rules and freedom. As a last sign of defiance, Buster removes Scamp's collar. Back at the junkyard, Angel is upset that Scamp has decided to join the Junkyard Dog gang. This makes Scamp up set and he accidently reveals that Angel wants to become a house pet. Angel runs out of the junkyard and Scamps gives chase. Meanwhile Buster has some unfinished business with Scamp. He sees his opportunity to get even with Tramp for leaving the gang. He allows Scamp to get captured by the dog catcher and a hauled away to the pound. Angel sees Scamp being hauled away and runs to tell Tramp about it. The two run off to the dog pound to rescue and later save Scamp. Scamp is thrown in the same cage with Reggie and Reggie wants his revenge. Reggie is able to break free of his chain, but before he is able to do anything to Scamp, Tramp jumps into the cage to save his son. Scamp is hurt while trying to help his dad to defeat Reggie. Tramp is able to defeat Reggie and father and son reconcile their differences. Scamp returns to the junkyard to reclaim his collar and give Buster the last word. Scamp, Tramp, and Angel arrive back home and Jim Dear and Darling adopt Angel. Unlike the original movie, Jim Dear and Darling now have faces to go with the rest of their body. In the original movie the front of their faces were never shown. Also missing from the movie is its most memorable song: Belle Notte (This is the Night). That song is only song at the end of the credits. This movie was just a lame opposite copy of the original. Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure gets a C-.

1388324,3,B0000524D0,"I have loved ""Lady and the Tramp"" all my life, and approached this DVD with anticipation and a little bit of fear, knowing I was likely to be disappointed.  So far, of all the Disney sequels, only Peter Pan II has been really satisfactory because even Disney is bound to the rules and restrictions of the Children's Hospital in London, which owns the copywrite.  Bambi II wasn't too bad, either.  This film, however, doesn't hit the mark.

There were, to be fair, a couple of good things.  The Edwardian-era look of roughly 1900 to 1910 was well done and the original house from the first movie was beauitifully preserved.  There was some amusement in the parody of the famous spagetti dinner scene because the two puppies ate spagetti as sloppily eager as normal dogs would, not the gentile way Scamp's parents once did.  It was also interesting that this time dogs were the villans (notably Buster and the pit bull), and this time the pound was not filled with heartbreaking hard-luck cases (abandoned strays, unwanted puppies, or purebred dogs who for whatever reason were no longer welcome in their homes), but with nasty, unpleasant street dogs. In fact, the whole analogy to teenage rebellion and the lure of street gangs was interestingly described, and in terms that kids could understand. On this level, it succeeds remarkably well.

Most of the younger children will probably like the film because the flaws won't be so obvious.  And while I hate to be a party pooper, let's look at 'em.

The first thing that annoyed me were the...songs.  Disney classics have always been known for their songs, and the original ""Lady and the Tramp"" had some wonderful ones.  But these song simply do not work.  They are not in the style or mood of the originals at all, and I was reminded more of ""The Aristocats"" which is admittedly NOT one of my favorite Disney films.  The picnic scene was far too reminescent of the awful old cliches in Disney films of the 70's which invariably had dogs wreak havoc at large human gatherings.  Aunt Sarah (speaking of the picnic scene) clearly didn't care much for a troublesome puppy like Scamp, even if she was accepting of the other dogs, but it nevertheless bothered me that a woman as fond of her own pets as she was, would actually take her two beautiful siamese cats to an outdoor picnic (cats!), in a park full of people and dogs. This is so unbelievably irresponsible for an cat owner that I shudder in horror.

And what they did to the established dogs that we know and love so well!  Tramp, himself once an abandoned dog (go back and listen to the dialog in the original film), is grateful for a loving home as most formerly-abandoned dogs often are, but he didn't sound or feel like Tramp very much.  The old spark simply wasn't there.  Scamp's three sisters, were clearly drawn in a more modern style than that of the 1950s, and were not sweet puppies, but annoying ones whose greatest joy in life seems to be getting a bath.  Jock and Trusty are mere shadows of their former selves.  Jock has nothing new to add, and Trusty is just terrible.  He is shown here as just an old dog with a feeble howl, nothing like the blood-chilling bay of a bloodhound on a scent that he had only several months earlier (I suppose the puppies are about eight months old if you do the math from the original film).

I also have to wonder about ""Jim Dear"" and ""Darling""!  They now have an absolute pack of dogs - seven in all, if you count Angel - but not one word about the obvious need to spay and neuter a few dogs before they find themselves up to their eyebrows in unplanned puppies!  Even in ""The Aristocats"", one got the distinct feeling that O'Malley had been neutered at the end.  As a dog and cat owner, this sort of thing really bothers me - particularly since the original film had a heartbreaking scene of a litter of unwanted puppies locked up in the pound: as good an advertisement for spaying your dog as I can think of.  And how come Jim and Darling know the street names of Tramp and Angel?  Do they speak Dog?  And what of the curious implication at the end that they are also possibly the owners of Jock and Trusty?  We already know otherwise from the original film.

Oh yeah...and the Dogcatcher!  This ""nice little New England town"" has had serious problems with roaming packs of stray dogs, something established in the first film, and leash laws are strictly enforced.  In the original film, the dog catcher was a shadowy, sinister figure in the eyes of the dogs, who is only revealed as a decent guy when he takes Lady from her cell and comforts her as he takes her away to be reclaimed by Aunt Sarah.  In this film, however, the Dogcatcher looks and talks like Don Knotts, and is a comical figure who seems possessed with the idea of catching any and all dogs, and takes pleasure in the pursuit.  He isn't sinister, and we don't even get to see a more sympathetic side of him.  He's just silly and slightly annoying.

I can't exactly say this film is bad, because it does have its good moments, but I could have lived easily without it - just as I could have lived without ""Aladdin II"" (though I quite liked ""Aladdin III"".  On the good side, it shows the importance of family and home and the foolish dangers of running away and getting involved in gangs.  But the negatives tend to get in the way.

I hate to say this, but the real highlight of the DVD are the three Pluto cartoons at the end.  They are wonderfully doggy, funny, and actually look as if they might be set in the same town as Lady and the Tramp.  Get the DVD for those, if nothing else.",1155254400,17,5606,4.477362204724409

1388326,5,B0000524D0,"Yes, I have seen this movie quite frequently, and I have to say that I side with Buster, the head Junkyard Dog. Why? Because speaking as someone who had been horribly abused, I have a feeling that Buster somewhere along the way, had a family of his own, and someone in his family, abused him. I could sense a lot of anger in Buster about families, and if is a case of abuse, then who could blame Buster for hating families? Plus, Angel and Scamp should have been a bit more caring to Buster than they were. Instead of acting in an unfriendly attitude, they should have asked Buster why he hated families so much, and I can bet, that ten to one, Buster would have responded that he did have a family, and someone abused him. He also probably would have said that the Junkyard is more of a home to him, than his human family. In addition, Scamp and Angel should have helped Buster out, putting themselves in his ""paws"". I could relate to Buster, if abuse is the case, and I cannot blame Buster for being so aggressive, and hateful towards families. Yes, the Junkyard is probably more of a home to Buster, and is a place of comfort, solace, and joy... and a shelter. The Junkyard for Buster makes him feel good, knowing he is safe from danger, and, actually, I am on Buster's side. Buster's attitude toward families is natural,being hurt in a family that he should have shared about with others, but did not want to trigger any more horrible memories for him. On the whole, Buster is a good dog, he really is. He is acting in a manner that anyone would act in... natural, and abused. Buster is really a good dog.

1388363,3,B0000524D0,"Alright, I'm back and I've rented it.  And the verdict is--well, not all bad. Not GOOD--not by any means--but not all bad.

 First off: the plot was okay.  It wasn't solid, and it doesn't stand up to any sort of scrutiny, but had this been a stand-alone and not a cheap-quel, it might have worked.  Maybe. The story was cliche. The tough girl is really a softie and she helps the naive guy.  I KNOW it's cliche, but I love that cliche.  It's too bad they didn't pull it off well. The characters made constant contradictions of themselves.  This thing might have worked if Scamp HAD actually been ""kind and decent"", or if Buster really DID think that ""Buster's trouble is Buster's trouble"".  ""But, hey, it's a kid's movie!  It doesn't need PLOT!""  Yeah, right!

  Animation: The norm for these Disney rip-offs is that the clean-up is nice, and a couple of seconds of animation are nice, with lots of inbetweens to fool the consumer into believing that this is quality animation.  Well, this followed suit, with a lot of sudden action and acting that didn't really help any of the character development or establishment.  Oh, and there were bad 3-D effects, as well.  No, wait--by ""bad"" I only mean ""really, REALLY OBVIOUSLY not hand-drawn"".  They might have been nice in an all 3-D movie, but they were horrible against these hand-drawn backgrounds.

  Third, if you're going to make a cheap-quel of something that's already MORE than resolved enough, at least stick with the original in SOME REMOTE WAY.  Okay?  I mean, they tried--they replicated the backgrounds and layout--but they didn't bother with the most important things like personality.  Tramp, after 6 months (in movie time), had had a complete personality transplant!  He turned from the cocky, charming rogue into the preachy, overbearing, unskilled father.  Lady lost any life or spark she once had.  Because, of course, moms and dads don't have ANY personality of their own, right?  They're just ""Mom"" and ""Dad"". Right? Wrong!  I mean, yeah, there would be some adjustment for Tramp in a family, but he NEVER got mad in the first movie.  He was so relaxed-sounding and charming!  Sure, the replacement voice had the same kind of sound to his voice, but all the cockiness and  whimsy of the original voice was gone and he just sounded--I don't know, FALSE.

  The thing that they lost the most, however, was the relationship between the people and the dogs.  In the first movie, the dogs were really DOGS.  Yeah, they had some human action (e.g. talking), but you could TELL that they were dogs because

  a) the animation kept enough dog action/anatomy in these clearly human actions--i.e. characteristic dog lips and teeth, even though the dog is talking; Tramp rolls over laughing at Jock and Trusty

  b) the way they thought of humans was inherently doggish--calling the man ""Jim-dear"" and the woman ""Darling""; running out to meet Jim-dear when he came home, etc.

It's sad that this is what Disney has bent to - taking successful films, and turning them into lamed, limping sequels.

While children might find the story entertaining and adorable, their parents will likely find it lacking and a poor attempt to ride on the success of another film.  It felt cheap to me, and like a formula film - which it truely is.  Along with a rash of other ""II"" movies the plot goes like this: Protagonist of first film has kids.  Kids face similar issues their parents faced - perhaps with some reversal of situations (In this case, Scamp desires to become a street dog.)

I think it's one of the sad indicators of Disney's current attitude towards animation.

Upon seeing this film again this year, I have to admit that the animation was at least more decent than in some of the other DTV releases.  The music was merely forgetable to me.  Though the youngest kids seemed to enjoy the movie, the older (above 6,) did not.  They were bored less than halfway through.

He runs away and meets a mean dog (Chazz Palminteri) and a street dog named Angel (Alyssa Milano). Other voices include Jim Cummings and the late Mary Kay Bergman.",1053648000,2,1097,4.330097087378641

Lady & the Tramp was Disney at it's finest, but this movie just felt 2nd tier the entire way through.  The animation was dead-on, but the script, music, and voice talents were bland and uninteresting.  If it weren't for the special features, and the fact that it keeps the kids quiet for 70 minutes, I'd only give it one star.
Bottom line is that it had little purpose besides dealing [with] how parents are boorish control freaks who set up a bunch of rules ""for your own good"", but only after children experience the hard-knock life for themselves can they ever accept any guidance or wisdom from their parents.  The lessons in these movies are not lost on the kids...I caught my daughter soon after a couple of viewings telling me she doesn't want to take a bath because she's ""a wild dog"".  She took the bath.

LADY AND THE TRAMP II - SCAMP'S ADVENTURE is just unremarkable and in fact leaves the viewer wondering if Walt Disney, if he were still alive, would have permitted the lack of fair play and unforgiving nature of the Scamp character. This movie almost gives the viewer a message that good guys finish last. I did not have any high expectations before I saw this movie but to see a sense of fair play being slowly chipped away by the studio that was the icon of fair play left me empty.

1388420,1,B0000524D0,"...when a mean-spirited ending ruined the film and it's message.  Zero stars!
WARNING: THIS MOVIE DESTROYS ITS OWN VALUE SYSTEM! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FILM! (If you've already bought it, send it back to Disney!)
The storyline is actually fairly promising:  we follow a rebellious Scamp as he runs away to join the Junkyard Dogs.  Along the way he discovers that his dreams of being ""wild and free"" are not as great as he imagines; nor is his life at home with his loving family as dull, nor restrictive for no reason. It's a good vehicle to teach kids about their needs and desires balanced with responsibility and family. That is, until the end of Scamp's time away from home, where the story takes a HUGE wrong turn that ruins the movie and renders it morally bankrupt.
Obviously Scamp decides to go back to his family, but there is one last thing he has to do, he says, as he bids farewell to the junkyard dogs: he must humiliate the leader, Buster (intentionally knocking a piece of junk at him as a farewell), laugh at him as he gets pinned under a fallen mound of junk (which it seemed was also the intention), and then leave him trapped there alone to ""learn his lesson."" I sat there dumbstruck as I watched this unfold on screen -- what a stupifyingly mean-spirited thing for the ""hero"" to do!  In a story like this, a good character does not treat others this way!  We've spent the whole movie learning about the meaning of family and love, and fair treatment for all, and what does Disney give us in the end?  Scamp AND Tramp (whose response is ""That's my boy!"" or some such) suddenly turn cruel and selfish, just like Buster.  There is no mercy, no last act of kindness or even pity for the wrongheaded Buster, who is now utterly alone as the other junkyard dogs also abandon him. Such a fate is more than enough punishment for Buster, but instead our so-called ""hero"" gets to rub his nose in it!  WOW -- what a class act!
Disney should be truly ashamed.  I can only assume that our cynical, post-modern society has affected (infected?) those responsible for this film to the point that they do not understand the difference between being a loving and caring character, versus an adversarial and mean one.  (These new Disney ""values"" should require that they tack a new ending onto ""Cinderella"", where she laughs at her stepmother and stepsisters as she stalks out the door with the Grand Duke.)  So aren't Scamp and Buster supposed to be polar opposites? The end of this movie makes them one and the same.
Absolutely shameful!!  What kind of message is Disney sending?  This movie is aimed especially at impressionable children; mine will never see this film again.  Thankfully I didn't buy this; if only I could get my money back for the rental!",1001203200,78,2757,4.5772357723577235

However each of them have been or will be good...Lady and the ramp II was excellent. It takes place only a few months after Lady and Tramp get hitched in the original movie and now they have pups, three girls and a boy.  The boy wants nothing but freedom he doesn't believe that sitting around in a house is what dogs should be doing. ""Rules, Rules, Rules!"" is his sarcastic reply to most of what his father says to him.  However as most Disney movies, there are so many morals in this wonderful masterpiece about home is where you belong and where the love is.  Your children will watch this and fall in love with all the characters, well maybe not Buster!  It may be a good idea for them to watch Lady and the Tramp the original to get familiarized with some of the characters. But even if they don't they will fall in love with the movie.
Disney did a great job matching voices for this masterpiece as most of the original voices have sinced passed on. Jodi Benson does the voice of Lady and for those of you that are big Little Mermaid fans she also did the voice for Ariel in both the original and the sequel.  Disney originally didn't want her to have the part because they said too many people would associate the voice with Ariel, however Jodi went home and made a demo of her voice doing Ladies voice and sent it in anonomously and Jodi got the part because Disney thought it was a perfect match to Barbara Luddy's voice in the original!

1388425,4,B0000524D0,"Movie Summary:  Tramp and Lady have settled down and are raising a nice little family. They have three little girls who look and act just like Lady and one little ruffian boy named Scamp who takes after his dad. All the trouble centers around scamp who is bored with being a house dog. He thinks that things look so much better for the stray dogs that live at the junk yard. The first chance he gets, Scamp runs away and joins the junk yard dogs. There he makes a friend that helps him see how things really are and just how good he really had it.
My Opinion:  Being a straight to video release, I didn't have very high expectations for this film. Usually that's a signal that the feature isn't up to par. But in Scamp's case we were very pleasantly surprised. We are Disney fan's, but not to the point of liking something just because it is Disney. Scamp's Adventure had a descent plot that stuck together to the end, one which my 4 year old daughter could follow and enjoy. The songs weren't bad either. The lesson that is taught is a good one.  Family is important and you are lucky to have people who love and care about you.
DVD Quality:  Wide Screen Anamorphic with DD 5.1 audio. Both sound and Video were very good. There were enough special features to satisfy my daughter who has become a special feature junky. They include a couple of older Disney short cartoons, some games and more.
What You Should Do:  Get this DVD if you've got Disney fans in the house. It's worth adding to the library especially if you have Lady and The Tramp. The kids will love it.

1388427,4,B0000524D0,"It could have been so much worse.
Yes, it's a low-budget direct-to-video production.  And yes, it is merely a money-making sequel to one of the great animated films.  But it's a good low-budget money-making sequel.  Computer animation techniques are used well, if not spectacularly.  The dogcatcher's car, and all the gates and fences are computer-animated, and reasonably well.
The writers and animators clearly feel a responsibility to be true to the original, and also feel free to write a new story.  The result has both the freshness of originality and the joys of nostalgia.  Lady and Tramp have become parents, and have taken on more responsibilities, and also a little frustration with the puppies.  The new characters, notably Angel and Buster, feel like they belong in the story.  Angel is the girl-puppy Scamp meets on the streets, and Buster is the junkyard dog who has risen to leadership after the Tramp disappeared from the streets.
Scamp is out on the streets to be a real wild dog, and has only contempt for his house-dog parents.  When the junkyard dogs start reminiscing about the great legendary street dog, and Scamp eventually realizes that they're talking about his Dad, the scene is both reminiscent of, and wildly different from, Lady's similar education about the Tramp in the first film.  Similarly, while Scamp and Angel eat at Tony's like Lady and the Tramp did, the scene is quite different.  It's not the suave Tramp showing off his favorite restaurant, but two nervous teenagers on a first date.
Some moments ring quite true, as when Tramp goes out on the streets to look for his son, and wishes he were still the old Tramp.  If you are familiar with the original, you'll meet a lot of old friends, including Jim Dear, Darling, Jock, Trusty, Si, Am, and Aunt Sara.  You'll also recognize the house, the backyard, the pound, and many of the street scenes.  They took the care to get the details right.
The segue from the first serious talk between Scamp and Angel to the next danger scene was very well handled.  It's a perfectly timed sequence, and I WON'T give you any details.
All in all, a pretty good original story (aimed more at kids than at grown-ups), competent animation, characters I can believe in, and enough nostalgia to make me happy.  If you've seen the first one, this will feel like a worthy lower-budget sequel, not like a travesty.

1388444,4,B0000524D0,"This is slightly hard to rate. I enjoyed it, but, I guess some would say I'm a die-hard Disney fan. They do a great job of keeping up continuity here, it makes an almost seamless transaction...minus one flaw(Buster...where was he in the first if he was such a big person in Tramp's life??). The characters are enjoyable enough, the best one in my personal opinion being Danielle, the dorky, goofy, funny sister. The animation is spectacular on almost all acounts, running smoothly from scene-to-scene. Voice-overs weren't done as great as the rest of the film, though. Jeff Bennett, the voice of 'Tramp', didn't quite go with the voice in the previous film, and Scott Wolf sounded a bit weaker than intended. Alyssa Milano was alright...but not amazing. The best portrayed of all are Lady, Colette, and Danielle... Kath Soucie gives life to the two girl pups, and Jodi Benson does a good Lady. The plot is simple enough - tired of rules, a young, teenage kid runs away. But hey - think of the audience here. What 5 year-old wants a complex Matrix movie?",991353600,3,1053,4.728260869565218
1388445,3,B0000524D0,"Disney brings us its latest in an unending line of sequels, ""Scamp's Adventure,"" and while they have certainly done better, they have also done worse.  The quality of animation is not up to par with Disney Feature Animation; still, the animators do a good job of bringing the characters to life. Lady and Tramp have not aged a day since 1955. Trusty still talks about his sense of smell and ""Ol' Reliable,"" and Jock still gives him grief about it. There's a nice fight between Tramp and a huge dog in the dog pound, and once again we are treated to a spaghetti dinner with the two romantic leads (though it is highly doubtful that this will become a classic scene like its predecessor.)  Angel is a nice addition to the family, but Buster's gang (except for Buster) isn't given a lot to do and sometimes comes off more as excess baggage.
The songs range from good to terrible, but the vocalists sing them nicely.  The background score is serviceable, but nothing memorable.
The voice work, on the other hand, is quite good. While I don't like Jeff Bennett as the dogcatcher, he is very good as Tramp. Chazz Palminteri does a nice job as Buster, and Alyssa Milano gives what may be her best performance as Angel. Then there is Scamp (who is the spitting image of his dad). He is voiced to PERFECTION by Scott Wolf. Wolf does a superb job of showing Scamp's wild streak and his soft side.
All in all, while ""Scamp's Adventure"" is flawed, it still makes for rather entertaining viewing. It is my hope, however, that Walt Disney Television Animation will turn their attention to more original material for their future releases.",987552000,4,1624,4.612456747404845
1388446,3,B0000524D0,"I've always thought the original is one of Disney's best movies, so I was rather uneasy about how they would handle this one, especially after the act of violence that was The Little Mermaid 2. The good news, however, is that this is in fact a lot better than that or most of Disney's other DTVs thus far. It's almost on par with The Lion King II. The animation is actually quite good, and the scenery really recreates the look of the original. The song numbers aren't good, but they're not utterly offensive either, ""A World Without Fences"" is actually quite enjoyable. The script becomes rather cloying near the end, and the 4th of July parade sequence in the middle is way over the top for cheap laughs. One touch I really liked, however, was how the current street dogs have made a martyr out of Tramp, accounting his ""disapearance"" to a heroic death fleeing from all the dog catchers in town, plus the police. The voice casting is also pretty good, and it's nice to see Si and Am again. By all means watch this movie, but don't hold it to the standards of the original or you'll still be disappointed.",986342400,2,1106,4.48019801980198

Seriously, it's very hard for me to be objective about 'Scamp's Advnture"" because I love ""Lady and the Tramp"" so much. The ""Bella Notte"" park is there. Tony's is there as well as Lady, and my favoriite, the Tramp.  I enjoy this new movie just for the references to the original.  I do have two problems however.  What is with today's Disney and those cliffs and character pyramids???  There is no escaping them in Scamp's Adventures either.  My other complaint is the fact that Scamp's voice is a little too mature considering the young pup he's suppose to be.  I do like the way they did another spaghetti scene, but did it different.  You can't have Lady and the Tramp without spaghetti afterall. I also enjoyed the glimpse into Tramp's past.  Would Scamp's Adventure be good if it wasn't Lady and the Tramp related?  It's funny how this stubborn pup makes a silly fool of himself trying to fit in with his new junk yard friends.  It's intersting how this young pup learns that his relaxed, soft living father was really the best street dog around.  It's exciting to watch this pup learn about running away and a family's love.  It's very cute how this pampered house puppy meets a girl puppy from the streets.  They help each other and fall in love.  Does this movie make it on it's own?

WHY DOES IT APPEAL TO HER SO MUCH - AND WHY WOULD IT PROBABLY HAVE APPEAL FOR OTHER KIDS? Well, to answer this, first allow me to qive a ""quickie plot summary:  In Lady and the Tramp 2, Scamp (Tramp's mischevious offspring) is sick and tired of living the ""cushy"" housepet life.  He longs to be FREE; free of annoying rules, like:  DON'T MAKE A MESS IN THE HOUSE!  (Are you starting to get a clue as to why this movie will appeal to kids)?  Anyway, so he ""breaks free"" of the leash that binds him, and runs off to join the ""junkyard dogs"" - where he falls in love with Angel - a cute pup, who ironically, longs for a home of her own!
