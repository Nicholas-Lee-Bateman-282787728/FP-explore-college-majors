8061373,2,B0009IW8L2,"I was looking for a family-oriented DVD to show to a Sunday School class, but this story is so inaccurate it is unusable.  Scene after scene is full of made-up or rewritten events.

I'm also not sure who the audience is supposed to be.  It's a little bit violent for young children, but the production and story don't seem sophisticated enough to interest anyone over the age of 5 or 6.

There are a lot of songs.  The songs are so melodramatic the scenes are laughable.  When young David is singing, he sounds like a woman.

This movie was a huge disappointment.",1228867200,3,563,4.46078431372549
