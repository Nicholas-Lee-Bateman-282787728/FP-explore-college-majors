845442,5,6304288492,"Delightful romantic comedy benefits from a top-notch script (by Max Shulman and Julius Epstein-co-writer of ""Casablanca""!), and the unexpected chemistry between lovable schlump Matthau and starchy Jackson, who are both fabulous. Affirming once again that true love will triumph over casual sex, ""Calls"" is a charming, clever romance, with plenty of laughs and heart. Matthau fans should flock to this.",1125964800,5,401,5.7
845443,4,6304288492,"This laid back romantic comedy from 1978 is a real treat, particularly because of the performances. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson were so wonderfully combustible in the movie, they were again paired in 'Hopscotch', though oddly in the second film, they spent little time on screen together. Art Carney is a riot as a bumbling Chief of Staff, and all the supporting performances, from Richard Benjamin to the always delightful Candace Azzara, are equally enjoyable. Howard Zieff has a lackadaisical directing style that perfectly suits the material and actors. He basically gets out of the way and lets everyone shine. If you have not seen this movie, give it a try. (It was so successful it was made into a sitcom the following year, but without Matthau and Jackson, it didn't really go anywhere.)

One odd and rather irritating thing, though: The movie has the obligatory 70's love montage in the middle. In the original film, and in the TV versions and VHS versions, The Beatles `Something in the Way She Moves' was the background music, and it was just wonderful. The film was cut to the music, and it really had an impact on the two leads' relationship. Michael Jackson and Co (unless he has since sold the rights) must not have allowed the music to be used on the DVD, or made a ridiculous demand, for the song is missing. There is just some mediocre filler music behind the montage and it really hurts that section of the film. It's annoying they were not able to put the movie on DVD in its original form.",1120867200,56,1516,4.677902621722846

845796,4,6304288492,"House Calls is good for a few relaxing date night or family night entertainments. In 1978 the bumbling hospital with back stage maneuvering and a new lost patient every day was not a well-used plot. Think Scrubs only 23 years sooner. This is rarely laugh out loud funny but a fair balance between wry humor, light romance and no intellectual challenge.

Given how often people complain that there are no roles for people not ""Hollywood Gorgeous"" and new love is rarely a plot device for a more mature people , House Calls breaks these rules and proves that the result can be fun to watch. As this suggests this is a cast driven movie and so I give you:

Walter Mathau as Dr. Charles Nichols has the right mix of surgeon's arrogance and a Doctor's sense of duty. Mathau gives us a complex rendition of his usual gruff lovable wrinkled faced dog.

Glenda Jackson is the independent and opinionated Ann Atkson.  She is all wiry class and better at sharing the twinkle in her eye than anyone else in the cast.

Back up performances by:
Scene stealing Art Carney as the befuddled and duplicitous Dr. Amos Willoughby

Dumb blonde, arm candy, all grown up and suddenly rich and widowed  Candice Azzara as Ellen Grady - this subplot was deftly played out adding much to the fun of this movie

And as a likable best buddy and fellow Doctor, Richard Benjamin as Norman Solomon

Between these skilled performers, a fairly obvious plot and a mostly amusing dialogue, you are encouraged to relax and let it happen. There is no need to make notes or think deeply, just enjoy the craft of acting.",1387152000,4,1581,4.597864768683274

They negotiate an exclusive relationship for a two week trial period, and find that love doesn't always come easy.  Art Carney co-stars as an aging chief of surgery, and Richard Benjamin is Charley's best friend.  Matthau reminds us that true comedy does not descend to slapstick.  Jackson demonstrates that rare talent, an award winning tragedian  (""Women In Love"", ""Elizabeth R"") who can also win awards as a comedian (Academy Award for Best Actress in ""A Touch Of Class"").",1380931200,,629,5.067961165048544

846020,5,6304288492,"""House Calls"" is a delightful romantic comedy that focuses on prevalent social issues. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson have a wonderful chemistry together. Art Carney plays to caricature the bumbling bureacrat and surgeon who is director of an unsuccesful hospital. Richard Benjamin, so popular in 1978 when the film was released, was charming as Matthau's foil.

Jackson and Matthau first meet when Jackson is a patient of an ancient medical practice administered by Carney's character. Matthau, a top surgeon and recent widower beset by younger social climbers seeking his attentions, rectifies the old treatment with a simple medical procedure.

They next meet as debaters on a television program. After all the chirpies, he is intrigued by a woman who is closer to his age and can think. How they get together is a hilarious scene and a natural development of a relationship, instead of his usual flowers, dinner, overnight roll in the sack, home the next morning.

The title refers, of course, to the house calls he makes to his younger dates, not in any way related to doctor visits. This film is enjoyable with a definite nod toward compatibility and marriage. According to my brother, ""It's a pretty good movie,"" expressed with approval. Of course, I agree.

4.5 stars (Art Carney was annoying.)",1218672000,4,1305,5.08411214953271
846021,5,6304288492,Another enjoyable comedy. I think that Genda Jackson and Walter Mathou are a very good comedy team; they work well together.

846022,4,6304288492,"It may have marked the beginning of his `loveable' phase, but Walter Matthau is still on top form in House Calls, which sees him well paired with Glenda Jackson in a mature romantic comedy that has aged remarkably well. Funny lines abound alongside a couple of good comic setpieces (such as the unlikely couple trying to find out if the old Hays Code film censorship rule from the 1930s about having one foot on either side of the bed really does make sex impossible, a scene that feels like Julius J. Epstein's revenge on the censors), but what really makes it work is that character is never sacrificed for a quick laugh. What's more, these two people really do seem to belong together, and they exude comfort in their scenes together that's the very definition of screen chemistry. Sadly the DVD has been partially rescored (somehow Matthau and Jackson speedwalking in slow motion seems a lot less funny with a Henry Mancini underscore than the original Something in the Way She Moves Me) but otherwise is well worth the bargain price.",1202515200,,1038,4.740331491712707

846024,4,6304288492,"The 1978 film ""House Calls"", directed by Howard Zieff (who also directed the 1980 comedy ""Private Benjamin""), is an romantic entertaining comedy focused around the lives of several doctors working in a fictitious hospital in California.  The main character, Dr. Charley Nichols, who was played by the wonderful actor Walter Matthau (1920-2000), is a recent widower who begins to have a series of short romantic interludes with a number of women until he happens across a woman in the hospital that has a minor jaw fracture and is being treated by the hospital's aging & increasingly senile chief-of-staff, Dr. Amos Willoughby (Art Carney, 1918-2003, who is often remembered for playing the character ""Ralph"" in the mid-1950's sitcom ""The Honeymooners"").  The woman, Ann Atkinson (Glenda Jackson), quickly agrees to allow Dr. Nichols to treat her instead of Dr. Willoughby.  Later, Ann & Dr. Nichols are each invited to a medical debate on a PBS talk show and eventually end up dating each other; but, can Dr. Nichols give up running around with other women?  Throw into this the death of a prominent patient at the hospital, whose grieving widow (Candice Azzara) is threatening to sue the hospital if the hospital accepts a donation from her dead husband's estate, as well as Dr. Willoughby desperately wanting to keep his position as chief-of-staff and you have the recipe for a very entertaining film.

With a funny plot and engaging characters, ""House Calls"" deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  Though not nominated for any major awards, it inspired the creation of a television sitcom of the same name that ran for three seasons between 1979 to 1982 with Wayne Rogers taking on Walter Matthau's role from the film.  Other memorable characters from the film include Dr. Norman Solomon (Richard Benjamin) and Irwin Owett (Dick O'Neill, 1928-1998).",1192924800,,1853,5.055737704918033
846025,5,6304288492,"Roger Ebert once commented that Michael Caine never gives a bad performance.  Neither does Gene Hackman and neither does Walter Matthau.  This is one of his best.  Medical humor always seems to work.  Here it soars, with the help of Glenda Jackson, Richard Benjamin, and--in one of his most hilarious roles--Art Carney.  The subplots are also well done.  There's even a brief appearance by Matthau's real-life son.

This is the sort of movie you can watch again and again and the underlying story is sweet and loving, not cruel like The Odd Couple or long in the tooth like Grumpy Old Men.  This is Matthau at the top of his rumpled powers, playing a skilled surgeon with notable human failings ripe for redemption.",1182297600,,715,4.7560975609756095

846027,4,6304288492,"I remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain matinees I took in when I was looking for a study break from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do some effective Tracy-Hepburn-style thrusting-and-parrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable Howard Zieff (he did ""Private Benjamin"") about a newly widowed doctor's aggressive re-entry into the dating game. It all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein (""Casablanca"") along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer.

Dr. Charley Nichols has just come back from Hawaii after his wife's death. Upon his return, he becomes aware that he is instant catnip to any and all the single women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief-of-staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley has to pacify to keep his residency. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted Englishwoman who bakes cheesecakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she expresses freely on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the show's discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the standard complications about how serious Charley is willing to become about Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under Willoughby's careless supervision.

It's just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpel-wielding skill of surgeons. Matthau is his usual 1970's curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty Ann, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bluster, while Richard Benjamin provides amiable support as Charley's colleague, Dr. Solomon. It's all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.",1155081600,6,2224,5.192200557103064
846028,4,6304288492,"In a career that featured a wealth of great comic performances, Walter Matthau gave few that were more delightful and relaxed than this one. In contrast to the wonderfully over-the-top style he displayed while winning an Oscar for ""The Fortune Cookie"" and being nominated for another in ""The Sunshine Boys,"" Matthau employed a lighter but equally effective comic touch for this 1978 romantic comedy. He plays a widowed doctor who is over his grief and ready to sow some wild oats, only to find that he's fallen for a woman who wants nothing to do with his playboy ways. Glenda Jackson, who later left acting to join the British parliament, is a perfect match for Matthau's game, and the two trade barbs beautifully in a film that plays so leisurely that it's over before you know it. Look for superb supporting performances from Richard Benjamin as well as Art Carney as the dottering and caustic hospital administrator. He hams it up wonderfully in a part far removed from the nice guy he played in ""The Honeymooners."" This is one of those movies that looks like it was fun to make. It's definitely fun to watch.",1134950400,22,1113,4.712820512820513

7868161,5,6304288492,"I love this film. Is it going to win OSCARS ? >>>NO! These are the funny, romantic, entertaining comedies of the seventies. Fantastic fun and romance. Quick synopsis: Charlie(Walter Matthau) is a very recently widowed Doctor who Anne(Glenda Jackson) meets in the hospital he works at. They like one another immediately but Charlie wants to experience being Single first... Great fun. Acting always great with both of these pros. PS: Refreshing movie considering it is about older people living their lives and falling in love. Plz make more of these.",1518307200,,550,5.122222222222222
