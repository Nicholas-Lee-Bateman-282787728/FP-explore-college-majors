4294587,4,B0049TC8IU,"Stan Lee hired the world's most flexible man to go find the greatest superhumans on the planet. They bring a camera crew with them to show you that these people are really out there.

As the team encounters the ""superhumans,"" they are asked to perform tasks that can't really be faked. And they generally get them looked at by a doctor to see what's going on to make them so spectacular.

A few people you'll meet are:
 - A man who can dive to the safety limits of a SCUBA diver, but only while holding his breath.

 - A musician who can play a nearly a whole symphony of sounds with his voice, all at the same time
 - Another musician who can hear a song and play it almost perfectly -- and he remembers every song he's ever heard
 - A runner who actually gets less tired the more he runs -- and he can run from the moment he wakes to the moment he goes to bed.

What makes these guys tick?
How did they discover their ability?
And how many people out there have spectacular abilities that they don't even know they have?

You'll learn the answers to all of these question through their compelling stories. Some thick with drama (like one man tried to kill himself but found he couldn't -- he was impervious to his chosen form of death). Others are displays of sheer insanity (like the man who likes to bash things with his skull).

You'll have fun and your understanding of what it means to be human will expand with each interesting episode.",1310428800,,1444,4.314814814814815
4294588,5,B0049TC8IU,"When this was on the History Channel, I watched one episode with a guy they call the hammer head.  They go to the boxing gym he works out at and break cinder blocks over his head and hit a cinder block on his head with a sledge hammer.  The host remarks that the cinderblocks could be absorbing most of the energy of the hit, and thus his head isn't super human at all.  To that I would challenge the host to break a cinderblock over his head, but instead the guy says ""I can show you something else.... But we can't do it here"".  Whoa!  Where are they going to go to show us this amazing feat?  Is it in Mexico?  Is it at the guy's house?  No, they end up at a Goodwill.  Apparently, you can perform amazing stunts of inhuman proportion at the Goodwill where the typical gym will say ""Not Here!""

In the meantime they conduct an MRI on the guy and find his skull is like 30% thicker than a typical human's so the guy really is ""Superhuman""  That's the great thing about this series.  Not only does it show you the superhuman feats, it attempts to explain why the person is able to do the things he or she does.

Back at the Goodwill Hammerhead pounds a nail into a board with his head.  He gets it about an inch in before he starts bending the nail beyond the point of any further  penetration.  The host is amazed by his feat and tries to give him attaboys, but he is sitting there with a big welt on his forehead and the only thing he could muster up to say is ""I did that"" or something like that.

If the rest of the characters in this series are as entertaining as Hammerhead, I look forward to adding this set to my DVD library!  That was easily one of the best things I saw on Television last year.  Actually, just having the Hammerhead episode is worth buying this entire series.",1303344000,,1787,4.1574344023323615

This isn't a show about people with laser eyes or retractable claws, but rather about folks with curious abilities and features that seem like something you'd see on the old 'Ripley's Believe it or not' program. The people that are featured are fascinating and their abilities really have you wondering what the potential is of the human body and mind.",1427673600,,361,4.838709677419355

8419323,5,B0049TC8IU,"My son is fascinated with people who have unusual skills and loves watching Stan Lee's Superhumans on TV.  He's also a huge fan of the Guiness Book of World Records, movies, speed, action, anything that's beyond the norm.  I was glad to find that Superhumans is on DVD.  It came fast and well packaged.  I've been buying from Amazon almost since its beginning and have been pleased 99% of the time.  For that 1% that I wasn't happy with, Amazon and/or the seller were always fast and efficient and very polite in making sure that they either refunded my money (usually within 24 hours or less) or replaced the item and rushed it to me.",1369353600,,635,4.48695652173913
8419324,2,B0049TC8IU,"The abilities of the people on this show are amazing, no doubt.  But the show's format is gimmicky and over=exaggerated, which makes their talents seem tawdry.  The show claims to investigate their powers ""scientifically"" but all I saw were a couple of lame attempts at measuring heart rate, reaction time, etc., with no depth of analysis.  (Although the high-speed camera is often very cool, e.g. a samurai cutting in half a baseball pitched 90 mph at him, not unsheathing till the ball is pitched).

Let me give you an example: There was a guy on there who's called a ""human crash test dummy."" He actually puts himself behind the wheel during car crashes, because the dummies can only give you so much information.  So he's putting his life on the line to help further the research on car crashes, ultimately helping save lives.  He's been through over 900 car crashes, more than anyone else on the planet, and hasn't had a single major injury yet, not even whiplash.  That's definitely amazing, but it falls flat when you start comparing him to a superhero.  The voice over guy keeps hinting that he's ""unbreakable"" but it's nothing of the sort.  He's just studied car crashes so thoroughly that he can design them to be safe while still giving meaningful data that you can't get from crash test dummies.  The ""scientific test"" consists of hooking him up to an accelerometer and seeing how much G force he's subjected to during a crash.  Ok.. how does that help explain what's going on?  The only gesture they make towards an explanation is that he's trained himself to prepare for the G force just before it happens, which is not always an option in a car crash.  Look, anyone can do this, but only he has the balls.  He deserves TV time, for sure, but this show just cheapens his accomplishments.

In short: if you're into Guinness Book or Ripley's, you'll like it, but if you're expecting something as substantive as Mythbusters, you'll be disappointed.  I fell into the latter category.",1344556800,,1993,4.733333333333333

8419327,4,B0049TC8IU,"With comic book movies being released every other weekend these days, the world of superheros has never been more prevalent in our culture. Enter the History Channel and A&E with their perfectly timed new series ""Stan Lee's Superhumans."" To be sure this exciting series reveals itself to basically be a reinvented ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" by the end of the eight-episode first season. But the people profiled here more than make up for the slightly overdone title - for the most part they really are superhumans. From the Houston man who can bend metal and hold back a motorcycle with his hands to the samurai who can cut a beebee pellet in half after it's shot at him to the Indian man who can conduct electricity through his body without being harmed, there's more exciting feats of human uniqueness than you can fully comprehend.

The series is narrated and led by Daniel Browning Smith, known as the most flexible man in the world (I was honestly disappointed he wasn't fully profiled in an episode, but oh well). Stan Lee also makes a few appearances each episode from behind a desk, reminding the viewer why his name is attached to the show. Smith and Lee manage some decent banter, but Smith's personality is really the big selling point of the show as Lee mostly reads stiltedly from a teleprompter. As Smith travels around the world interviewing and helping with experiments on the various supposed ""superhumans"" his presence serves to ground the show with a light-hearted but inquisitive tone that does the people being profiled justice.

Though there's some question in my mind about the ""super""-ness  of some of these people (a guy who invented a solution to attract bees, a guy who claims to predict the future, and a guy who says he can knock people down with his mind) most of them actually are physically different than the rest of us. Whether their skulls are thicker (The Human Anvil) or their bodies don't produce lactic acid when they run (Dean Karnazes, the Ultramarathon Man) or they have skin that can be stretched to incredible lengths (""Rubber Band Man"") these people were actually born with physical traits that make them different and ""super""human. Most of the pleasure in this show comes from watching Smith revel in the discovery of these people's not-so-hidden talents. Though he sometimes overdoes his enthusiasm there's plenty to be excited about and he's the perfect choice to host a show like this.

I watched all six hours of Season One in one sitting (I guess I'm not very superhuman myself) and I was thoroughly entertained throughout. If they plan a second season, I just hope they leave out some of the less impressive types and bring in more people like ""Quick Draw"" - a man who can draw his gun and shoot a target ""faster than a rattlesnake."" Also, is it too much to ask to find a superhuman female?",1318291200,4,2844,4.751012145748988
