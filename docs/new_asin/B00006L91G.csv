1783694,1,B00006L91G,"I have never seen a more stupid excuse for a movie in my life.  Not one person can act, all the effects are really bad, and the plot is even more stupid.  None of the scenes match up with each other.  The Legion is never really explained, and neither is most of the movie.  This movie was the most retarded thing I have ever wasted [$$$] and 2 hours on.",1059264000,,353,4.0
1783695,1,B00006L91G,"I would like someone at Artisan to explain to me why they even chose to release a movie by Olaf Ittenbach. This is a director who is known for comedic horror soaked with over the top gore. This Artisan release is so severely edited that not only is there very little gore, but key character development suffers, the story loses continuity, and the comedy is left feeling flat. This is not how this movie was intended to be seen. Imagine watching ""Aliens"" but without all the scenes involving suspense and the aliens themselves and you can get an idea of how this version compares to the uncut release.
If you must, buy it for the ""Making Of Legion Of The Dead"" documentary. It's far more entertaining and infinitely gorier than the movie itself.",1049241600,3,745,4.609022556390977
1783696,1,B00006L91G,"This movie absolutely [stinks], there's nothing more I can say. Even the ""un-rated super uncut uncensored blah blah"" version wouldn't save this [movie]. I hate the person who wrote it and the [person] who took on the task of directing it. I wanted to rip my eyes out every time I saw the tall, blonde ""[villain]""  Save your money, don't even rent this garbage, go see something more productive, like a grass-growing contest.",1049241600,,424,4.808219178082192
1783697,1,B00006L91G,"Yes, UGH! This movie is not worth the effort of thinking of a proper title for my review.
Inane, headache-inducing horror aspires to be another FROM DUSK TILL DAWN but fails miserably. The plot revolves around a pair of Satan's minions who are roaming the desert searching for souls to add to Hell's army. Though LEGION OF THE DEAD has numerous scenes sure to please gore hounds; the movie chokes on its very ineptitude. Kimberly Liebe's beauty is the film's only asset- but her performance is one of too many liabilities. A horror in every sense of the word and a picture to be avoided at all costs.",1044921600,,600,4.564814814814815
1783698,1,B00006L91G,"I would have liked to have tried and explained this video so that those who wanted to rent it would have some idea as to what it is about. However the only thing I can state with any authority is that it is impossible to follow. From totally silly scenes involving dead ""Evil Hencemen"" ( ,that are about as evil as used car salemen) to so called ""Heros"" that ...lack the the smallest degree of ...credibillty.
  Very..very bad acting, very..very..very bad directing,and even worse editing. Highschool productions have more time and effort put forth into them then this video. This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever had seen.
  And this comes from a video watcher of prides himself on his B-Movie collection.",1040688000,,719,4.728
1783699,1,B00006L91G,"From what I read of other viewers this American version was cut and was supposed to be much better than this.  But wow!! I have not given a 1 star for a film in a long time.  The film does not have any continuity and makes absolutely no sense at all.  It now makes all the more sense when the others who have watched the uncut versions, to see how butchered this film is because it makes absolutely no sense at all.  THe only good thing I could say about this is it does have some humor in it that will totally make u laugh but its not enough to make up for the ... of film this is.  If I could go back to the past in a time machine, I would tell myself this was a mistake.
Good points: some humor that is unique
Bad points: choppy story, bad plot, boring film, no action
Overal grade :  F-",1038096000,8,790,3.90625
1783700,1,B00006L91G,"How can I put this? ""IT STINKS"". It seems they spent the majority of the budget on the cover then on the actual film. The movie makes no sense what so ever. It jumps from scene to scene without continuity. What was this guy thinking This is not even worth renting. Save your money folks, this one is not even boring enough to be called a sleeper.",1037664000,2,346,4.17910447761194
1783701,1,B00006L91G,"This is perhaps the worst movie I have seen. It is very, very poorly done, and lacks the campiness that redeems even movies like Plan 9 from outer space. It tries lamely to entertain with comic relief, the two door-to-door undead recruiters for Satans ""legion of the dead,"" but in the end fails utterly. If I could un-watch this movie, I would.",1037145600,2,344,4.564516129032258
1783702,1,B00006L91G,"Please do yourself a favour and do not spend money in a movie so edited and cut that it's impossible to understand it. I bought the movie because I believed it had something to do with vampires (if you see the cover you'll understand), however it is far from it. Anyway, I cheched the ""Making - of"" documentary and found all the escenes that I didn't see in the movie. I believe they cut almost 15 minutes of the film. It might be a good movie, but not in this condition. It should have never been released like this. REAL PITTY.",1036886400,4,529,4.247524752475248
1783703,1,B00006L91G,"Well,congratulate the MPAA for another job well done.
I have owned the Japanese and German dvd of this movie
for about a year now. I received my copy of the American
release today and what I got was a superb picture,
top notch sound, and EVERY GOOD PART REMOVED AND CUT
FROM THE MOVIE!WHY IN THIS DAY AND AGE SHOULD WE HAVE
TO HAVE THIS MUCH CENSORSHIP IN A SILLY HORROR MOVIE?
There are many movies out there that show way more gore
than what was taken from this movie. Those of you that
have the foreign versions of this film,hold on to them!
The first cut appears in the first 10 minutes when our
first victim is recruited for the legion. Yes folks,the
last half of that scene is totally gone! OLAF ITTENBACH
is a GERMAN FILM EXTRAORDINAIRE who is on the rise in
the business and is very god-like to the serious horror
fan who likes their special effects on the outrageous
side. He does ALL of the special make-up,writes and
directs all of his movies! This movie un-cut is a 5 star
movie all the way. It has humor,action,suspense,special
effects(very little cgi-mostly original),and a story.
Oh well,sorry to have to break the news. There is no reason
that this movie should have been edited this heavily or
even edited at all! Major letdown! Well,I hope DOG SOLDIERS
is much better. Thank god for multi-region dvd players!",1036540800,8,1326,4.552301255230126
7971033,5,B00006L91G,"A lot of this movie reminds me of Tru Blood. I'm not interested
in watching any more Tru Blood seasons, but I loved this movie
and believe it is under rated for a B horror movie.",1293926400,,178,3.9722222222222223
7971034,1,B00006L91G,"Why is there no ZERO stars rating option? Because this movie needs it.  This movie is absolutely terrible.  I can't even begin to explain how rediculously and absurdly bad-bad-bad this movie is.  Wow. Bad.  No plot, no reasoning, just a cavalcade of bad actors attempting to act like something other than bad actors in bizarre, randomly spliced-together scenes leading nowhere.

Plot: nonexistant.

Setting: unknown.

Characters: dull.

Conflict: undefined.

Story setup: none.

Action: bumbling.

Horror: weak attempts.

I rented this movie because it looked awesome, and the title reminded me of one of my favorite Testament songs (""Legions of the Dead""). When I returned it I asked for my money back.",1144281600,,703,5.290909090909091
7971035,2,B00006L91G,"This is easily one of the most confusing, meaningless low budget horror movies out there. The writer has several characters, some connected, some not, all thrown together with no plot and little meaning. The dialogue between the characters is interesting in places, but that can't save this movie.

It seems like it was meant to be a re-telling of From Dusk to Dawn, but then characters are included that are building a Legion of the Dead, yet this doesn't seem to tie into the rest of the film other than to provide a catchy title for the movie.

I have no clue what the creative vision was that was spinning in the writer/director's head, just that whoever put this together needs to have an editor take a much firmer hand next time. The ending is even terrible.

Look, if you want funny horror, watch Evil Dead- again. If you want Tarantino does vampires and demons, watch From Dusk Till Dawn (ok, he's just an actor in it, but humor me here). Just do yourself a favor and don't waste an hour and half of your time like I did.

Not Recommended at all.",1143504000,,1054,4.44559585492228
7971036,3,B00006L91G,"..what this movie is all about?  While stylish and often times very funny, LEGION OF THE DEAD doesn't know whether it wants to be a tribute to EVIL DEAD or just an excuse for some bloody goings on.  Two friends drifting through the California desert are picked up by a deranged hitchhiker.  Meanwhile two grey-suited hitmen are going around killing people to enlist them in a legion of the dead.  The hitmen are funny, especially the inept drunken one who is always getting himself killed over and over again.  They answer to a tall blonde who purportedly may be the Devil.  We also have a buxom barmaid named Geena who is the one person the Devil is seeking.  how does this all come together?  It really doesn't and that's what keeps this movie from being a good one...it does have some funny moments, but the acting is histrionic and since we don't know what in the world is going on, its ending only manages to confirm the lack of coherency.",1097193600,3,944,4.511764705882353

7971038,5,B00006L91G,"Okey I see this has gotten a ton of bad review but I highly suggest any good B-Rated horror fan to get this movie. It was so utterly stupid that I couldn't believe I hadnt heard of it before. Im a vivid fan of the Bruce Cambell trilogy that is The Evil Dead, The Evil Dead(The 2nd remake that seemingly had nothing to do with the first cept for a few characters) And the third ""Army of Darkness"". If you like those movies for the pure stupidity that makes it utterly funny you'll love this movie's senselessness. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A EXSPECTING A HARD CORE HORROR FLICK! THINK OF THE ABOVE TRILOGY AND YOU'LL GET THE PICTURE. Luke, have my babies.",1083024000,,650,4.25

7971041,3,B00006L91G,"Ok, so it wasn't the movie of the year. It doesn't however necessarily deserve all the bad reviews. Perhaps, the plot could have been slightly more developed, rather than handing us snipets of the stories motive. The reason that I say this is that if it were simply a slasher style film with little plot that would have been sufficient, but the storyline for this film required that the viewer have more knowledge of what the events leading up to and occuring in the film concerned. High points of the film included the following: decent acting, and subtle dark humor, as well as a few moderately entertaing action sequences. Of course, the highest point of the film...actress Kimberly Liebe. Her acting was comparable with the acting of the other cast members, but her beauty was the most memorable! I give this film 3 stars.",1064534400,3,826,4.743055555555555
7971042,3,B00006L91G,"The movie starts when a dudes father (who created the ninja zombies) died from some mafia gang. So he decides to make his scientist friend re-create ninja zombies and makes them go out and kill the mafia gang. Then some scientists decide to resurrect the mafia and then gains control of the ninja zombies and sends them after the dude. The dude gets killed by the ninja zombies and he is ressurected to go after the ninja zombies and the mafia (in which the leader sounds like he got his hoo hoo dilly chopped off). I just keeps going back and forth, back and forth.
NOT A BAD MOVIE!! Not many zombies in this film but the action is rather decent for a B-movie. The story is somewhat repetitive, the gore is a bit weak but in the end it is an enjoyable film. BUT I have a serious problem with the advertisment. Some idiot tried to compare this movie to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD on the back cover. IT'S NOT! It's nothing compared to this movie. These zombies don't eat people. FALSE ADVERTISMENT!!!!!!!!!! :)
(not much zombies)
most entertaining part: | the high-pitched mafia guy |",1063411200,2,1081,4.4646464646464645
