8042307,5,B0006Q9446,The real footage and practical knowledge makes this movie. My son is airplane-obsessed and sits in front of it with complete concentration. He's never watched the boat movie though. Highly recommend it for any kid in love with either airplanes or boats!,1362614400,,253,5.0476190476190474
8042308,5,B0006Q9446,"We got several of these videos, and although I think they were made in the late 80's/early 90's, it doesn't matter to a little boy. All the titles are fun and interesting. Hope you enjoy. Highly recommend!",1338940800,,205,4.5675675675675675
8042309,5,B0006Q9446,"Tugboat, tanker, aircraft carrier, sailboat, yacht, waverunner/jetski, life raft, yacht, submarine, cruise ship, cruiser (Navy boat), barge, fishing boat, hovercraft, military tank that turns into a boat, boat that turns into an offroad truck - WOW you see all the boats I remember were on this tape just from watching it twice (in a row, yes my 2 y.o. son wanted an immediate ENCORE!)

I have to tell you, my son loves (OK is obsessed with) boats and he definitely got his fair share of them with this wonderful video.  OK so you can tell it's a homegrown low budget movie.  But it gave lots of great material and you really felt like you were there talking to the different boat captains, etc.  It seemed that much more REAL. And sure his material was a little corny but at least it was different and not so hollywood.  I think Hard Hat Harry and his two little sidekicks did a great job. I haven't gotten to watch all of the airplane one yet, it seems a little more advanced for my son, although I was learning a lot watching it about the positioning of the airplane wings to move the air, etc.  I also felt a little weird when Harry (on the airplane one) showed up in those 2 kids' living room with no shirt on. OK it was because he was a genie but it still seemed a little wrong. Just a tip to Harry there buddy.  Otherwise I am very grateful you gave us a video that is chock full of different boat clips and information regarding the use/features of them.  Thank you Hard Hat Harry wherever you are, now I don't have to watch the movie Andre 50 times just for my son to see the 20 second clips of boats during the movie!!!",1218585600,,1629,4.300653594771242
