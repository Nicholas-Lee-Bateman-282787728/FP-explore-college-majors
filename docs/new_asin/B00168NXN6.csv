3154029,5,B00168NXN6,Purchased for 3 yr old grandson...he would watch this DVD non-stop if allowed...he loves it!  Has good variety of trucks and other vehicles to entertain for hours!,1235174400,3,163,5.037037037037037
3154030,5,B00168NXN6,"My wife and I have two boys one of which is 2 years old and is pretty much obsessed with cars and trucks, and dinosaurs and is really a boy's boy. He also loves Monster Trucks. We've got some from our library but spent most of the time wincing at the idiots they had hosting the show. Why people feel kids need people with the IQ's of an over-cooked cabbage hosting show's I will never know. Anyway lots of pointless ""action"" and even my son was bored of them. Finally I said that all they really need is a tape only showing monster trucks for an hour and nothing else no stupid skits or pointless voice overs that kids don't care about anyway. This DVD fits the bill perfectly, it's never dull and just keeps the action coming. It's perfect for little kids who just want to watch the trucks do their thing. If you have kids you could't ask for more.",1234915200,86,850,4.253086419753086

3154033,4,B00168NXN6,"Bought this for my monster truck-obsessed 3 year old. He absolutely ADORES the video. Plays it pretty much every day. I personally think the quality is kind of poor, but it has lots of footage and changes from one thing to the next so young ones don't loose interest. I would definitely recommend purchasing this for any kid who thinks monster trucks are the end-all and be-all.",1216252800,20,378,4.656716417910448

3154069,2,B00168NXN6,This has to be one of the big disappointment - watched it expecting to see a monster truck show kind of - all it is is clips with crappy music which hides the sound of the trucks - I and my son both disappointed - not worth the $$,1399334400,,230,3.7142857142857144

3154073,4,B00168NXN6,"I purchased this for my grandson who just turned 5.  It's a great DVD, he was glued to watching it.  It's great that it doesn't have a lot of talking in it.  I only give 4 Stars because I thought some of the images showed way to many pixels (maybe that's what they wanted). Great buy for the money.",1397606400,,298,4.016949152542373
3154074,5,B00168NXN6,"My son LOVED Lots of Trucks and Trains, and Lots of Monster Trucks was just as great. We do not watch monster truck shows regularly, which I see some reviews are disappointed because they wanted to see their favorite trucks. This is just a video of random trucks doing random things. Not actual racing. Which is exactly what we wanted.",1397433600,,335,4.6
3154085,2,B00168NXN6,"Our son (age 2) LOVVVVES the original Lots & Lots of Trucks DVD - good production value, good songs, good pace, good length. In comparison, this video sucks. It's so much longer, but not because there is more content. It's just longer. The production value is total crap - long segments of monster trucks racing, then the same kind of race again, then again. Every once and a while there is a psychedelic kaleidoscope effect on the video, very strange if you ask me. The songs/music are no where near the quality of the original. Overall the editing is poorly done, they clearly put this together in a hurry. I was so hopeful because our son is a HUGE monster truck fan, but even this couldn't hold his attention. He likes holding the DVD box to look at the pictures but doesn't actually want to watch the video anymore.",1395446400,2,820,4.510067114093959

Older kids maybe not so much, as it does not have the engine sounds on the sound track.  Older children would probably prefer to hear the engines reving rather than the childrens songs.",1394755200,,347,4.292307692307692

3154089,5,B00168NXN6,"I bought this DVD for my two-year-old son who loves, loves, loves monster trucks.  This video is great because it goes straight to the action--no talking or commentary.  It's comprised of a lot of short clips of monster trucks jumping or doing tricks or whatever it is that monster trucks do.  There's plenty of action, which keeps his attention while I cook dinner or unpack groceries.  I don't know if an adult would enjoy the DVD (it appears to be mostly older clips and has an annoying soundtrack), but it's perfect for little boys that love trucks.",1387584000,,553,4.670103092783505

3154095,3,B00168NXN6,We had this playing in the background of my sons 6th bday party.  The boys liked it.  I rated that it was ok because the quality is pretty poor and the sound of it gets pretty annoying and can handle in small doses.,1370995200,,215,3.9767441860465116
3154096,3,B00168NXN6,"Okay, my son likes it granted. However, the footage is very grainy, the added special effects came from another era. The music came straight out of the 80's and repeats over and over. Wish it wasn't so dated and a little more appealing to the ear. If I am going to let my son watch  something over and over, it could surely be somewhat bearable to listen to.",1370304000,,358,4.264705882352941

3154108,5,B00168NXN6,Besides the annoying music this video is strait forwarded and all about monster trucks.

The bad 80's graphics, music, mullets and oversized trucks just make the dvd more fun for the adults in the room to watch and remember the neon and styles of the 80's.

He loves watching it and has watched over and over in the three months we have owned it so far.",1346198400,6,394,4.213333333333333
3154114,3,B00168NXN6,"I purchased this product after reading so many reviews stating how this is an all truck movie about trucks in various performances where kids are just drawn to it.  Unfortunately after receiving this movie for my 3 year old, both he and I were very disappointed.  While I agree it is much more affordable then the Monster Jam films you can buy for double or triple the cost, there is a reason why they cost more.
This movie comes up with a menu similair to movies you see that are pirated with a computerized cheapy menu of scenes for the Main Menu.  After you select to play all you first notice the out of focus recording of many trucks driving around to music louder then the truck reving noises.  Unfortunately this was a downer for my 3 year old.  He is huge into trucks and has a couple of the Grave Digger Monster Jam movies and while they were more costly, they also keep his attention much more and he watches them more often.  While he was mildy entertained by seeing the ""big trucks!"" the first time watching this movie, he has not wanted to watch it again and I ended up buying more movies from Monster Jam because he likes the details of the in focus recording and the sounds of the crashes and the trucks more then the overwhelming music in this video.
That being said, I gave this movie 3 stars because it is what it says...it is a movie of lots and lots of trucks, it's just too bad they didn't do a better job putting in cleaner film with better resolution and a little quieter music so the kids can hear the trucks more.",1340668800,,1538,4.304498269896194

We also got another ""lots and lots"" movie, and after awhile my son's favorite part was the preview for this one! This is not educational viewing, but it's a good hour of entertainment and a chance to get some chores done around the house.  Even the baby (9 months) will watch it for a few minutes here and there.",1338854400,2,438,4.0813953488372094

It has fairly lame music and even seriously some karaoke sounding stuff. We turned it off. It did hold his attention but wasn't what we were thinking at all. Also most of the monster trucks weren't the newer ones he knows the names of. Seemed old.,1308096000,,365,4.154929577464789

3154157,2,B00168NXN6,"Alright, so I ordered this dvd for my 2 and half yr old, expecting it would be just as awesome as most all of the reviews said it was. BUT, I cant hardly even watch it without having it almost MUTE! If you don't mind heavy metal music then nevermind this comment, however, it was just waaaay to much for me. Yes, there is a lot of action...but the graphics on some of the taping of it hurt my eyes (i don't even know how to describe this part) it was electric colors flashing throughout the ""way to close shots"" of the monster truck action. But anyway, my biggest complaint is the CRAZY heavy metal instruments playing throughout most of the movie! I have enough noise going on in my household with 2 kids that I don't need crazy music screeching in my ears as well. I wish I wouldve spent the extra money on the other actual Monster Jam dvds :(",1293494400,2,845,4.222222222222222

3154160,1,B00168NXN6,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a great video for my kids ages 3 and 5. Boy was I wrong. The background music drowns out the best part-the roar of the engine. You have to strain yourself to hear it. Also, everything is in fast foward or slow motion, which kind of takes the wow factor out of the action. It's more like a music video.

Since we got this for our two year old son, I'm rating this a complete success. Just be aware that, to adult eyes, this dvd is going to be of questionable visual quality, and REALLY monotonous. The good news is it's not unbearably long. If you have a young one that adores all things vehicular, they will love this video. We have another set that had WAY too many talking heads.

3154188,2,B00168NXN6,I thought the DVD was annoying especially the music.  I was hoping for just the monster trucks doing their thing but there is all this editing and I just could not follow it very well.  My 3 year old kind of lost interest in it and he LOVES monster trucks.  Would not recommend.,1256601600,2,278,4.2075471698113205

The music is annoying and I can't sit and watch with him like I do with his other monster truck DVDs.
You can get a better DVD then this for free when you buy a 3 pack of ""monster truck fan favorites"". Other then that I recommend spending a little more money on a Monster Jam DVD. There is a lot more and better footage then on this one and it is entertaining for adults as well as kids.",1255305600,5,609,4.0

It is pretty long and great for long car trips.  I guess I was looking for a vide with more cohesive racing/show.  This video is short clips of various races in both the U.S. and other countries.  It breaks out the clips by different things the trucks do.  Like crashing, mud racing, water racing and more crashing.  It is great for kids I guess, but I could do with out the disjointed segments.  Also most of it was shot before the digital age so the video is very graining and 80's looking.  I'm now looking for a more modern version of this video with clearer images and less cheesy special effects.",1253059200,21,753,4.246478873239437

We've got some from our library but spent most of the time wincing at the idiots they had hosting the show. Why people feel kids need people with the IQ's of an over-cooked cabbage hosting show's I will never know. Anyway lots of pointless ""action"" and even my son was bored of them. Finally I said that all they really need is a tape only showing monster trucks for an hour and nothing else no stupid skits or pointless voice overs that kids don't care about anyway. This DVD fits the bill perfectly, it's never dull and just keeps the action coming. It's perfect for little kids who just want to watch the trucks do their thing.

3388566,2,B00168NXN6,This has to be one of the big disappointment - watched it expecting to see a monster truck show kind of - all it is is clips with crappy music which hides the sound of the trucks - I and my son both disappointed - not worth the $$,1399334400,,230,3.7142857142857144

3388570,4,B00168NXN6,"I purchased this for my grandson who just turned 5.  It's a great DVD, he was glued to watching it.  It's great that it doesn't have a lot of talking in it.  I only give 4 Stars because I thought some of the images showed way to many pixels (maybe that's what they wanted). Great buy for the money.",1397606400,,298,4.016949152542373

We do not watch monster truck shows regularly, which I see some reviews are disappointed because they wanted to see their favorite trucks. This is just a video of random trucks doing random things. Not actual racing. Which is exactly what we wanted.",1397433600,,335,4.6
3388582,2,B00168NXN6,"Our son (age 2) LOVVVVES the original Lots & Lots of Trucks DVD - good production value, good songs, good pace, good length. In comparison, this video sucks. It's so much longer, but not because there is more content. It's just longer. The production value is total crap - long segments of monster trucks racing, then the same kind of race again, then again. Every once and a while there is a psychedelic kaleidoscope effect on the video, very strange if you ask me. The songs/music are no where near the quality of the original. Overall the editing is poorly done, they clearly put this together in a hurry. I was so hopeful because our son is a HUGE monster truck fan, but even this couldn't hold his attention. He likes holding the DVD box to look at the pictures but doesn't actually want to watch the video anymore.",1395446400,2,820,4.510067114093959

Older kids maybe not so much, as it does not have the engine sounds on the sound track.  Older children would probably prefer to hear the engines reving rather than the childrens songs.",1394755200,,347,4.292307692307692

3388586,5,B00168NXN6,"I bought this DVD for my two-year-old son who loves, loves, loves monster trucks.  This video is great because it goes straight to the action--no talking or commentary.  It's comprised of a lot of short clips of monster trucks jumping or doing tricks or whatever it is that monster trucks do.  There's plenty of action, which keeps his attention while I cook dinner or unpack groceries.  I don't know if an adult would enjoy the DVD (it appears to be mostly older clips and has an annoying soundtrack), but it's perfect for little boys that love trucks.",1387584000,,553,4.670103092783505

3388592,3,B00168NXN6,We had this playing in the background of my sons 6th bday party.  The boys liked it.  I rated that it was ok because the quality is pretty poor and the sound of it gets pretty annoying and can handle in small doses.,1370995200,,215,3.9767441860465116
3388593,3,B00168NXN6,"Okay, my son likes it granted. However, the footage is very grainy, the added special effects came from another era. The music came straight out of the 80's and repeats over and over. Wish it wasn't so dated and a little more appealing to the ear.

3388611,3,B00168NXN6,"I purchased this product after reading so many reviews stating how this is an all truck movie about trucks in various performances where kids are just drawn to it.  Unfortunately after receiving this movie for my 3 year old, both he and I were very disappointed.  While I agree it is much more affordable then the Monster Jam films you can buy for double or triple the cost, there is a reason why they cost more.
This movie comes up with a menu similair to movies you see that are pirated with a computerized cheapy menu of scenes for the Main Menu.  After you select to play all you first notice the out of focus recording of many trucks driving around to music louder then the truck reving noises.  Unfortunately this was a downer for my 3 year old.  He is huge into trucks and has a couple of the Grave Digger Monster Jam movies and while they were more costly, they also keep his attention much more and he watches them more often.  While he was mildy entertained by seeing the ""big trucks!"" the first time watching this movie, he has not wanted to watch it again and I ended up buying more movies from Monster Jam because he likes the details of the in focus recording and the sounds of the crashes and the trucks more then the overwhelming music in this video.
That being said, I gave this movie 3 stars because it is what it says...it is a movie of lots and lots of trucks, it's just too bad they didn't do a better job putting in cleaner film with better resolution and a little quieter music so the kids can hear the trucks more.",1340668800,,1538,4.304498269896194

We also got another ""lots and lots"" movie, and after awhile my son's favorite part was the preview for this one! This is not educational viewing, but it's a good hour of entertainment and a chance to get some chores done around the house.  Even the baby (9 months) will watch it for a few minutes here and there.",1338854400,2,438,4.0813953488372094

Also most of the monster trucks weren't the newer ones he knows the names of. Seemed old.,1308096000,,365,4.154929577464789

BUT, I cant hardly even watch it without having it almost MUTE! If you don't mind heavy metal music then nevermind this comment, however, it was just waaaay to much for me. Yes, there is a lot of action...but the graphics on some of the taping of it hurt my eyes (i don't even know how to describe this part) it was electric colors flashing throughout the ""way to close shots"" of the monster truck action. But anyway, my biggest complaint is the CRAZY heavy metal instruments playing throughout most of the movie! I have enough noise going on in my household with 2 kids that I don't need crazy music screeching in my ears as well.

You have to strain yourself to hear it. Also, everything is in fast foward or slow motion, which kind of takes the wow factor out of the action. It's more like a music video.

Since we got this for our two year old son, I'm rating this a complete success. Just be aware that, to adult eyes, this dvd is going to be of questionable visual quality, and REALLY monotonous. The good news is it's not unbearably long. If you have a young one that adores all things vehicular, they will love this video. We have another set that had WAY too many talking heads.

3388685,2,B00168NXN6,I thought the DVD was annoying especially the music.  I was hoping for just the monster trucks doing their thing but there is all this editing and I just could not follow it very well.  My 3 year old kind of lost interest in it and he LOVES monster trucks.  Would not recommend.,1256601600,2,278,4.2075471698113205
3388686,2,B00168NXN6,"My 3 year old likes all the newer monster trucks like Blue Thunder and Monster Mutt but this DVD is really old footage and doesn't have the more modern trucks in it with the exception of Grave Digger and not much of that. The music is annoying and I can't sit and watch with him like I do with his other monster truck DVDs.
You can get a better DVD then this for free when you buy a 3 pack of ""monster truck fan favorites"". Other then that I recommend spending a little more money on a Monster Jam DVD. There is a lot more and better footage then on this one and it is entertaining for adults as well as kids.",1255305600,5,609,4.0
3388687,3,B00168NXN6,"I bought this dvd because it had a lower price than the ones at the actual monster truck shoe we went to.  I was surprised by the length of the show.  It is pretty long and great for long car trips.  I guess I was looking for a vide with more cohesive racing/show.  This video is short clips of various races in both the U.S. and other countries.  It breaks out the clips by different things the trucks do.  Like crashing, mud racing, water racing and more crashing.  It is great for kids I guess, but I could do with out the disjointed segments.  Also most of it was shot before the digital age so the video is very graining and 80's looking.  I'm now looking for a more modern version of this video with clearer images and less cheesy special effects.",1253059200,21,753,4.246478873239437
3388688,2,B00168NXN6,"My 7 year old son really liked the videos, mostly cut together well to keep your attention.  However, my main issue is with the quality of the disc.  The disc itself is not a stamped DVD its a purple bottom DVDr someone would burn at home!  No where does it it say that in description...",1244332800,4,287,4.181818181818182
3388689,2,B00168NXN6,"I don't want to be mean, but I'll be honest. This video is target for kids, but I think this DVD doesn't educate kids about monster trucks. There are some nice classic trucks, but this video doesn't do justice for any truck and I was hoping the annoying music would go away, but never did. I give 2 stars for monster trucks, but kids and adults will not like this DVD.",1243900800,,368,4.197183098591549
3388690,4,B00168NXN6,Most young boys have a fascination with trucks and my grandson is no exception. My son took him to an arena to see the monster trucks in person but they were so loud they left after 15 minutes. Knowing how much my grandson enjoyed them - I bought this CD.  He has watched it many times and never seems to tire of it. I am now his favorite relative.,1242259200,2,348,4.043478260869565
3388691,5,B00168NXN6,AFTER MY GRANDSON WATCHED THIS DVD HE HAD TO HAVE THE MONSTER TRUCKS HOT WHEELS TRUCKS & NOW THAT IS WHAT HE PLAYS WITH DAILY.  I WILL BE BUYING VOLUME 2 FOR HIS BIRTHDAY..,1239148800,2,172,4.0588235294117645
8261570,4,B00168NXN6,"Our 2 year old son loves this video. It's a little cheesy with 90's footage and production quality. It's kind of cool to see how monster trucks were 20+ years ago when they were based off real trucks, but they're not as exciting as today's trucks. The video also includes some mud racing and junk car rollover competitions. It's all good fun either way.",1514764800,,353,4.53125

8261574,3,B00168NXN6,Its an alright DVD. I bought it for my two year old whos obessesed with Monster trucks. It has some weird 1990's PowerPoint effects with 1980's rock music. Was kinda disappointed that there was hardly any monster truck sounds as that is whag my child loves.,1489104000,,257,4.608695652173913
