6853448,4,B00Q2WGOAA,"A force of nature brings a vacationing Swedish couple's (Johannes Bah Kuhnke and Lisa Loven Kongsli) various doubts and resentments to the surface in this heavy, but also quietly amusing drama.  The performances are riveting in their minor-key authenticity, the central avalanche sequence is a frightening spectacle, and the film raises interesting questions regarding masculinity, as well as the expectations woven into any domestic tapestry and the pain experienced when they are unmet.  (It reminds me of The Loneliest Planet, a far less heralded film in which a man's brief moment of cowardice returns to haunt him.)  Now and then, the formal pretensions here, such as the abrupt eruptions of Vivaldi and a too-blunt visit to a luridly macho nightclub, threaten to obfuscate rather than enhance the human drama at play, but this never becomes a significant problem.",1420243200,,869,5.282608695652174

6853451,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"We join a Swedish family on a skiing holiday in the French Alps. It's clear that this is a happy bunch, a father, mother, son and daughter. While eating lunch on a scenic balcony, an avalanche suddenly transforms their lives.

Director Ruben stlund, working from his own script, brings us two hours of R-rated drama, as he explores the dynamics of bravery, sincerity, love and loyalty as they are brought into play by a potential natural disaster. I am in awe as I watch these people switch effortlessly from Swedish to French to English with nary a pause (captions provided when necessary).

We watch:
* Johannes Kuhnke as the father, Tomas. This is the first vacation he has had in quite awhile. Five whole days...but that avalanche interrupts everything. His first instinct is for survival, to his everlasting regret.
* Lisa Loven Kongsli is Ebba, the mother. She has been looking forward to this family vacation, but when disaster strikes, her first instinct is to protect her youngsters.
* Sister and brother Clara and Vincent Wettergren portray sister and brother Vera and Harry. They begin looking askance at their father and worrying about a possible divorce.
* Kristofer Hivju plays Mats as a classic Viking, he is an old friend of Tomas and sees himself as sensitive and loyal.
* Fanni Metelius is Fanny who humorously points out the fallacy in Mats' reasoning.

To a non-skiing person, the staggering amount of heavy machinery necessary to maintain a successful ski resort is astonishing. As are the steady booms of cannons which are designed to trigger avalanches during the night and leave the slopes safe for the customers during the day.

Winner of the Jury Prize at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, and nominated for many other honors, this highly praised film is just opening in the United States. (The original title of this film is ""Turist."") In my opinion, the ending will be very gender specific. Each gender will interpret this enigmatic ending in very definite (but different) ways.",1419724800,6,2003,4.9171597633136095

The premise is interesting, and I was expecting more from it.  I was expecting a reserved, yet bubbling european emotional tension, but for whatever reason, it didn't rise up to a good level.  The acting, in particular by the children and the wife was very good.  I hated the music, it was extremely dated and almost overly stereotypical to the point where I was wondering if it was tongue in cheek over the top.

Afterwards, I will admit to thinking about the film, and I guess that is a sign of quality, if it makes you think about it.  This is a relationship film, and deals with aspects of people being together, raising children, trying to keep their relationship vibrant and meaningful and not stale, etc.  SO,  check it out, I probably wouldn't buy it, but if you in mood for foreign film, and the subject matter, perhaps you will find it higher star rating than I....Cheers!",1506643200,3,877,4.54140127388535
6853458,2,B00Q2WGOAA,"Overrated. Just because something is slow moving  with nice scenery does not make it a quality film. There was no character development or a sense of connection to them as a couple so you never felt them ""falling from grace"" because there is never any grace to begin with.  There was too much left unexplained and seemingly random for the sake of trying to leave things artfully vague. The scenes consistently felt unrealistic to me, especially in their interactions with their children.  The only interesting character, I don't know his name but the redhead with the beard, was never fully integrated into the story.  So many of the choices and actions of all of the humans, particularly the mom, were disturbing  (processing her trauma by revealing that her husband abandoned her while in the company of others but never actually speaking an honest meaningful way to him about it )  The ending was bizarre. I wanted it to be over. Don't waste your two hours .",1501891200,,961,4.759036144578313
6853459,4,B00Q2WGOAA,"Force Majeure is a film from director Ruben Ostlund which plays off appearances of the happy Swedish family on a skiing holiday in France, husband,wife and 2 children, posing for a collective family photo at the start; against the reality through a controlled avalanche, that reality is not what it seems. The husbands reaction is to run away, grabbing his mobile phone, while his partner protects the kids. There are effective shots of the snowy wilderness and ski slopes. Tomas(Johannes Bah Kuhnke) cannot account for his actions after the event, tries to alter it and sees it differently, when Ebba((Lisa Loven Kongsli), recalls it with another couple. Deep embarrassment ensues. He is the deeds creature. This has unalterable consequences on the family.

Is Tomas a husband or father to his family? Ebba wants to ski by herself next day. She also is shocked by a  married womans taking on lovers,while she is away from her family, in an open relationship. Again when Tomas meets his friend  Mats and his young girlfriend, Ebba chooses to bring the subject of Tomass less than ethical actions up, Mats says when we act instinctively we are apt to lose control of our actions in the need to survive. Ebba shows footage on Tomass mobile phone of what happened. The truth is clear to see, although the incident is shrouded in the snow- smoke thrown up by the avalanche. Blink and youll miss it. Internal cracks in the familys relationships show up when they are inside the wooded rooms, or when Tomas and Ebba  stand on the landing outside their room, watched by a hotel worker as he smokes a cigarette.

The second couple to share the scenario, themselves are affected by what they have learned, and argue themselves about gender roles and expectations( Matss with his young lover not his wife). The film effectively moves daily between the interiors and exteriors, using a repeating motif of Vivaldis music to underscore the passing time. There are some talky scenes and we are reminded of Strindberg and Bergman, but at times this doesnt work. Tomas and Mats go skiing and hes encouraged to scream out his frustrations. Later while relaxing back at the outdoor hotel they are embarrassed by younger holidaymakers. Scenes of embarrassment are also played out by the couple as they clean their teeth in their bathroom, watched by an all-seeing eye.

Tomas locked out of his hotel room gets swept up into an all male frenzied party crowd, when he witnesses a dark night of the soul. As time goes on the children become frightened their parents will divorce, due to the unleashed tensions; Tomas has a meltdown of emotion, in full view of a hotel worker, whom they ask to let them back into their room. The inhibitions of the Swedes to emotions is played out to the full, but actions speak louder than words. The film is brilliant and reveals how little we know how wed react in crisis situations or how little we know our partners. Some scenes are awkward and unbalanced (e.g. Tomass weeping uncontrollably), the strange ending. Disturbing, yes. Cool relationships may survive, not passionate ones.",1501632000,,3098,4.857954545454546
6853460,1,B00Q2WGOAA,"At first glance you might be forgiven for thinking this is a disaster movie. It is not, except insofar as the movie itself is a disaster. It is beautifully shot but one or two scenes aside it is an overlong drama about characters about whom it is impossible to care - other than to wish that they'd been buried under an avalanche so as to spare oneself their orgy of soul-searching, self-pity and snivelling. This is not Nordic Noir but Nordic meh.",1500076800,,448,4.475609756097561
6853461,4,B00Q2WGOAA,"It's unfortunate that the average American watched this film and complained as if nothing happened. European cinema puts simple ideas on screen and then asks the characters in the story to deal with them, unlike American films which decided decades ago to use sound and visual effects in place of story and storytelling, asking nothing except reaction from character and audience alike.

The central conflict involves a morality play - do you save yourself, or do you save your loved ones in the event of an emergency? Is there a correct answer? Is it unmasculine? Is it unmotherly? Is it inhumane? These are the questions put forth to a family on vacation in the mountains, who must deal with the consequences of choices made by instinct in the moment. Even more, the film doesn't shy away from the uncomfortable humor of the scenario or its aftermath, even as the family tears itself apart.

If your far more used to turning your brain off for 2 hours, look elsewhere. If you're opening to questioning yourself and the ones you love, watching with you, enjoy this fascinating dark comedy and discover something about who you are underneath it all, and pity those who tell you to skip this film, inconsolable with rage at what they discover.",1486252800,5,1242,4.799065420560748

6853463,1,B00Q2WGOAA,"I've seen this movie and discussed it with fellow movie goers. It's definitely Not funny, even by quirky British standards. If anything it's kind of depressing. Basically, a Brit family visits a French ski area. An avalanche nearly over runs the family while they're having lunch. During which the husband sensibly runs for his life and leaves his wife and 2 kids to hide under the table. Well, they don't die and the rest of the movie is ""why did you run?""

6853465,3,B00Q2WGOAA,"Despite many accolades I found this film a bit trivial in its handling of moral dilemmas of cowardice and bravery. The moral judgment of the main character is quite obvious to me. In defense of the film I'd might add the main characters are all young people and may not have enough life experience to know the answers right away. Therefore I could agree it is a good movie (as moral issues drama) for younger generation viewers but for older audiences I found it to be a waste of time.

To summarize the plot the central issue is the behavior of the father in the family of four when sudden avalanche hits the ski resort where they are all eating their breakfast in preparation for the skiing the slopes. True, the event is sudden, unexpected and the reactions are instantaneous. Then the whole action evolves around the conversations between the main characters over what happened and why. And while discussing what happened different and new emotions and attitudes towards one another develop.",1480291200,3,995,4.784883720930233

The avalanche that is supposed to be such a life threatening scare is not even remotely close to them.  The characters are petty and kind of pathetic.  I felt like I couldn't identify with them in any way.  I wound up just feeling sad for them as human beings.

6853479,4,B00Q2WGOAA,"Force Majeure"" means something like ""Act of God,"" superficially in reference to a controlled (and metaphorical) avalanche that goes out of control and seems to be rolling toward the Swedish protagonist family as they lunch at a ski resort in the French Alps. The near-disaster brings out the worst in our family as they sulk, whine, and tattle about who should have done what and who should have been ""rescued"" by whom during the avalanche. A alternate title for the film might have been ""Schadenfreude"" because we (or at least I) find the resulting drama so petty and hysterically funny. Not everybody in our audience did, however. The film is supposed to be a comedy--albeit a Swedish comedy. The near-encounter with avalanche is probably just the last of who knows how many previous episodes that tipped the balance in the family dynamic--perhaps a Force Majeure in itself--and causes all parties concerned to engage in navel-gazing (their own navels and those of others) and sharing their findings with their friends. The children are supremely annoying--they are supposed to be--and I would have been tempted to leave them in a snowbank.

Living in a ski area and working at a college that teaches ski area operations, I was most fascinated by the depictions of all of the machinery and other clanking man-made mechanisms that are necessary for a ski resort--pulleys, conveyer belts, ski lifts, explosions, etc. These are all very much in the forefront and underscore man's manipulation of nature. Maybe the out-of-control avalanche was a bit of rebellion? Director Ruben Ostlund directed ski films before becoming a feature film director, and it is obvious. The skiing and ski machinery and mountain footage is the best in the film.",1458950400,2,1738,5.055749128919861

And although the tables do get turned on the last day, I experienced this movie as an exploration of the issues that (some) men face.  Rarely if ever do I watch a movie in which I come away saying: this movie captured experiences/feelings that are intimately familiar to me.  Force Majeure did that.  Thus, while there are comedic touches, the movie was more like a ""rewind"" of my own difficult periods and challenges, not always met, in other words a dramatic presentation of real life.  (Those who have seen the movie will understand the allusion to ""rewind"" here.)  In this sense, it is one of the most serious movies I have ever seen.  And it may just give others some insight into the lives of some of us (men) who are neither out saving the world nor doing stupid things as is typical in Hollywood/American film ""entertainment.""",1449878400,,1099,4.652849740932642
6853489,3,B00Q2WGOAA,"They can say what they want. This is a small film. The conjugal (nuclear or single) family is not in danger as the film pretends and tries to show. First that family is never alone in society. The parents work outside the family. The children since the age of 3 months have been taken care of by crches, kindergartens, pre-school institutions, and then the school system. The discourse around the film, including from the director, seems to mean the refusal of change, of the fact that the family today is changing, either by decomposing itself and then recomposing itself, or by becoming something completely different from what it was after Word War 2 (the American dream of a father working in the city, the mother, the son and the daughter and of course one dog, all living in some modern suburban frame-house with a garage and a car, not to mention a fridge in the kitchen and a washing machine in the bathroom). And imagine what it means for Asia and Africa and Latin America.

Second the film wants to reveal that in front of one particular dangerous event the mother would react like a hen who gathers her children around her to protect them, and the father would run. This is insisted upon and vastly expanded. It is the discourse of the film. At the end it is the mother that forces the bus-driver to open the doors of the  bus for the passengers to get off. Only one woman will stay in the bus. In this second episode the panic of the people is typically absurd. It is panic and it should have been negotiated differently and they should have stayed in the bus. Even if the driver was a little bit awkward, there was no danger anyway. Think of the street going down from The Station to the City hall in Thiers for one example of a narrow hairpin bend in this case within an urbanized context.

The third event (second in the chronology of the film) is the mother playing lost in the snow, hence forcing the husband to go back and get her, though she can call and strangely enough she is carried back but without her skis. No explanation. Total absurdity! Was the mother testing the father? At the same time the fact that in front of the avalanche, note it is an avalanche caused artificially by the skiing resorts management to prevent natural avalanches that could be then a lot more dangerous. In other words it is a purge or some drainage. The father got up took his i-pod and ran. The insistence of the film on this fact is an ideological stance that is very suspicious and then it is assumed all along that a man will do that all the time and that a woman will not. The film in other words is sexist.

The end is no end at all. It is a dumb as my thumb. And they don't even use their telephones (50 people altogether) and the film seems to imply these people are going to walk down to the valley without any help at all.

At best the film shows a case of neurotic reaction in a stressed situation but the neurosis seems to be on the mothers side, a neurosis that can become in the bus purely hysterical and if no one is injured in that bus it is thanks to a man, a bad man mind you who has divorced his wife and has abandoned his children to her who is playing the hen gathering her chicks in Oslo. A set of clichs that are even worse than those transported by mass movements like La Manif Pour Tous in France against the extension of marriage rights to all couples. If I had to suggest something I would say that these parents have not been able to cope with their children, the very fact they got children, and that the mother is reacting a lot more in a way as if she believed she was the only one who had carried them during the pregnancy (a pregnancy concerns there people as all midwife would say: have you ever seen a father knitting the booties in a special preparatory meeting of mothers to be in a midwifes office? I have.), given birth to them and raised them. The children have become her precious possessions and she sounds as if she were not working outside her home. That kind of attitude is not exactly integrating the father in the family group, far from it. But this is so common.

Let her enjoy the next five years and she will see what it becomes when the children get beyond the ripe age of fourteen. Then the mother will call Father! Father! after years of only calling/accusing Wolf! Wolf!

What is condemned here is clearly the family dominated by the mother concerning the children. If the children are thought and felt as being physiological parts of the mother, then the mother will be at least neurotic as soon as her children will be at stake and she will require everyone around her, the father first of all, to react like her and thus to treat her and her children-appendices as his own appendix. Thats not a conjugal (nuclear or single) family. Thats the extension of the child in the placenta even before delivery, as Marshall McLuhan would say. Thats a slave version of the conjugal (nuclear or single) family: the parents are the slave of the family and the children, and then the children are the slaves of the parents and the family. As soon as the mother started working outside the family that family structure did not exist any more, if it ever existed before.

It though is a bit more boisterous than planned and everyone thinks they are going to be engulfed.

6853533,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"""Force Majeure"" (2014 release from Sweden; 119 min.) brings the story of a Swedish ""picture perfect"" family: mom, dad and two adorable young kids (girl and boy), on a ski vacation in the French Alps. As the movie opens, the family is getting their picture taken on a ski slope. As ""Ski Day One"" unfolds, we get to know them a little better, and come to understand that Tomas is a workaholic who has devoted the next 5 days to this ski vacation with his family. On ""Ski Day Two"", the family is enjoying lunch outside. Then a controlled avalanche seems like it's getting out of control and heads towards the outdoor restaurant. At the last second, a mad scramble and pure chaos ensues, during which Tomas runs from the table where his wife and kids are sitting. What just happened exactly? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, if you think (due to the DVD sleeve jacket or the misleading movie title) that this is an disaster-action-adventure movie, you are in for a HUGE shock and disappointment, as this movie is almost the exact opposite of that. ""Force Majeure"" is a psychological and relationship drama, the likes of which I haven't seen very often and certainly not in recent times. Writer-director Ruben stlund examines the aftermath of what happens in the chaotic moments as the avalanche approaches the outdoor restaurant, to devastating effect. The issues of guilt and shame are put under the magnifying glass. Check out the key scene in which Ebba, the wife, retells what happened to a pair of friends during a dinner party the next day, as Tomas listens, unable to speak. Just amazing. One of the striking visual features of this movie is that many scenes are shot with a single camera angle. No editing or changing viewpoints, just the camera observing the scene for us, and us through the camera. I personally love it. The acting performances of the four family members are all outstanding, including the two young children. Now that I have seen this, and having seen the 5 foreign movies that were nominated this year for Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar, I am stunned that ""Force Majeure"" was not nominated.

If it sounds as if I am gushing about this film, it's because I am. I see a LOT of movies, and I can unequivocally state that ""Force Majeure"" is one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time. If you can appreciate a top-notch foreign movie that brings a devastating relationship drama, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Force Majeure"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1432857600,,2601,4.689277899343545
6853534,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"Force Majeure is a disaster movie of the uber-allegorical maxi-metaphorical contra-comedic type.

Its initially literal presentation might leave a viewer wondering ""What just (really) happened?""

Swedish married couple Tomas and Ebba take a hard-earned skiing vacation with their son, and daughter.  Pre-existing marital discord is overtly manifested in the kids' behavioral problems and sass. What they all need is a little cataclysm to get them to open up. Ironically, it's only the children who can explicitly state their fears and anguish with a painful economy of words. The adults bumble along in marital ineptitude: acting out, finger pointing, hand-wringing and cerebral dithering.  Couples sporting different relationship variations enter the fray: open marriage, April-December romance.  The catastrophic paradigm shift introduces a new pivot point to the relationship dynamo. Meanwhile, a lone janitor observes all.  He is looked down upon until they need him for something.

It's all funny insofar as a guffaw is a laugh and stupidity and ridicule are a sub-genre of comedy.  Every scene invokes cringing, blanching, and twitching.

So how could THAT be a 5-star movie?

Force Majeure was written and directed by Ruben &Ouml;stlund. One has to separate out what they think &Ouml;stlund really means versus what they think he wants a viewer to ""get"" versus it might all just be an observational expository with no single point and no heroes or villains.  There is a lot of subtext here that goes as deep as a viewer is willing to go.  There are no absolutes in societal gender roles. The same is true for watching movies.  When we think we have identified some truism, it can become ridiculously reductive.  Regardless, the fact is we are exposing our children to dangers - both real and imagined - everywhere with everything we say and do.

The visuals are stunning.  When not crystal clear, they are provocative and often downright absurd.  The dialog is original and unexpected.  The acting is both sublime and in your face.  (Watch Tomas's face fall - but rise again - in one of the many bathroom scenes.  It's subtle, yet childish.  It's as if he could only catch and hold Ebba's attention, everything will be put back aright.)  The emotional reactions invoked can be remarkable, even if they are surgically uncomfortable.  Scenes are complicated; there is humor, but it creates disorder.  The laughs may come days after watching Force Majeure.

&Ouml;stlund claims Force Majeure was inspired by an online video, which it certainly does mimic acutely.  But where he takes it is, well, debatable.  Hugely debatable.  The initial furor seems to center on gender roles, but it is what he does NOT expand or expound upon that is most chilling.  Who is minding the children during this? And what are we telling them with our words and actions?  Who's fit for their safe-keeping? And if you're not, and I'm not, then who is?  Because someone is going to.

THAT is the unspoken takeaway.  Say what you will about feminism being the death of chivalry, self-preservation trumping altruism, etc.  Our first priority - and our last best hope - is to stop acting like children and actually be raising our children.

6853538,4,B00Q2WGOAA,"There's a lot going on here amidst both the intense quiet and the intense noise. High up in the mountains there are constant explosions going on with forced avalanches. A ski resort is up there and one needs to be an excellent skier to even consider skiing there. It goes on and on and then intense fog can set in and you can get lost. Then the way in and out of this resort is on a huge bus that takes hairpin turns all the way down. I am not good with heights so this would be a vacation I would never take.

But that's the setting which really is a backdrop for a domestic drama about a family of four. Eventually they have two friends join them too. There are gender roles which are explored as well as age roles, the expectations we have of one another in these family or even friend units. On an interpersonal level there is quite a bit going on.

There is one woman who lives life with almost no regard to risk. She is just a side character but she is important because she is so far outside everyone else's range of emotions. She seems oblivious to any concept of risk. The others are along a gradation of what they will accept as risk and roles in life. And that gradation shifts just like the skiing conditions shift.

It would be tempting to call this a film about cowardice after you experience the avalanche. But it is so much more than that.

6853543,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"A bone-dry dark comedy about the self-deception we employ to avoid socially destabilizing truths. Ostlund uses the motif of the avalanche to represent the roiling uncertainties that gather force and destroy the facades underpinning our relationships - the sudden eruptions of awareness that necessitate the painful process of redefinition and renewal. The oppressively clean, symmetrical hotel doubles for the artificial order constructed by humans who seek to deny their essential self-interest in the name of higher values  family, community, and social consensus. However, Ostlund constantly reminds us of the porousness of this border, as music and footfalls are always in the background, honest conversations are forced to circumspection, and privacy is impossible to attain. Parenthood in particular is portrayed as a constant state of public performance  the husband and wife operating on unspoken terms to maintain an illusion of a united front. But the endless regimented duties of parenthood, which serve as an external representation of love and responsibility, are the very blind spots that allow for indifference and selfishness to accumulate unnoticed. Only when an act of God shatters the facade do we become aware of their perfunctory nature.

So on one level the film is a deep, beguiling look at the suffocating horror of unspoken expectation, but it's also a terrifically entertaining comedy: Ostlund uses the audience's expectation for big moments to confound expectations at every turn  looming dread turns quickly to bathos, traditional payoffs are inverted, and climactic moments are undercut by ambivalence. Scene after scene stun both visually and conceptually, culminating in a surreal finale that merges the film's ideas about parenthood, self-definition, community, and redemption into one remarkable yet ordinary image.

It should be noted that while it's clearly Ostlund's coming out party as a major talent, the performances are special as well: Johannes Kunke perfectly captures the silent terror of the mediocre alpha male declining into middle age, while Lisa Kongsli unearths the cruelty and self-righteousness beneath her character's otherwise reasonable point of view. It all adds up to an extraordinary film that shames the entire American indie film industry, which in its desperation to serve as a farm system for Hollywood has failed to deliver anything nearly this fresh and inventive in almost 20 years.",1430956800,4,2446,5.564516129032258

6853549,3,B00Q2WGOAA,"Force Majeure is a mostly in Swedish language film with moments of interaction with other tourists and French resort staff in English.  English subtitles are well done and the font makes them easy to read.  This is a very slow paced, obviously filmed to be arty at times film. It is incorrectly labelled and marketed as a comedy movie, as other than a few awkward or bizarre situations, there really isn't any comedy in the film at all.  Force Majeure is more a societal analysis film, a how should people behave in certain situations when they are supposed to fulfilling a certain societal role (such as father, bread winner, protector) type film.  Blurbs (on the Australian version) like ""Savagely Funny"", ""laugh as you wince experience"" and other quotes on the DVD cover are either deliberately trying to mislead potential watchers in order to get higher sales or are evidence these magazines and newspapers that made these claims, never actually watched the movie.  So is a film not prepared to sell itself on it's own merits worth watching.  Well yes and no.

The film does drag in parts, I'd say it needs editing but some lengthy scenes are obviously made that way for some artistic reason such as we watch the family just lying on their hotel bed for around a minute, they're not having a conversation, they're not doing anything, they're just lying there.  Whatever arty peer award the filmmakers were looking for with that scene I don't know, but it was just boring and has you reaching for the fast forward button. This arty in the makers eyes, boring in the viewers eyes method is done at other times too such as watching a cable car chord move through a wheel on the chairlift rotate over and over again.  The filmmakers also like to include going to the toilet scenes, one of the opening images is a young boy (the son) urinating at a urinal, we need to see this why?  Then we've got one of the parents using the room's ensuite toilet while the other doing something else in the mirror.  The toilet going fetish continues with the mother dropping her pants in the trees on a ski scope and notices the voices of her family go by down the hill.

On the plus side the film does tackle an issue that maybe needs to be raised. Should we really hamper on a couple of seconds of unintentional natural response reactive behaviour to judge a person overall.  This film premise revolves around the family in a restaurant admiring what they believe to be a controlled avalanche then panicking when it seems like the wall of snow is about to engulf them.  The father tells them to run, grabs his phone and wallet and does just that.  The mother frozen and confused in fear just stands there holding their daughter.  You'd assume  due to her inaction of perhaps waiting for her movement to know what he's supposed to do the boy waits at the table instead of following his father's fleeing heels.  Of course the family (and some other tourist diners) had completely overreacted with the white cloud only being avalanche smoke, so when the father returns seconds later he laughs it off and the family gets on with their meal.  Except the mother of course, who has her own interpretation of what just happened, ie he ran like a coward and left her and the kids to die.  Of course she doesn't voice that opinion there and then when events and reactions are fresh in everyone's mind to discuss.  Instead she waits until herself and her husband are seated with another couple for dinner and proceeds to bring up his cowardice in front of them.  He is of course embarrassed and angry at this action and publicly denies her version of events, which infuriates her further.

The rest of the film continues on with the aftermath of both these seen as betrayal actions by the other, which negatively affects their children caught in the middle and fearful of a divorce as the mother just refuses to let the issue drop, and in fact escalates it further when she brings up the issue with his childhood friend also at the resort.  However it's a pretty slow film throughout, the mother is certainly not a very likeable character, the father's actions when faced with the avalanche danger don't really make you feel to sorry for him either.  The awkwardness what would you do in this situation ""should we just leave"" by the childhood friend and his 20 year old girlfriend scenes when caught in the middle of this argument is probably the highlight of the film.",1429920000,4,4445,4.624681933842239
6853550,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"For myself, as a beginner Swedish speaker, it is perfect to put my ear to the test and there are plenty of intense and emotional conversations throughout the movie even though English is sprinkled here and there. I've never seen this part of France before so I really enjoyed the shots of the mountain resort. The movie's pivotal moment was not what I expected, however, the deleterious effects of that scene reverberate through all of the characters and it is quite stressfull to watch those emotions develop. I suppose the director and writer have done a good job at putting the viewer alongside the family's memorable vacation in that sense. The movie has some funny moments as well; the interactions between the family and their resort buddies are what stand out.",1429574400,,767,4.862595419847328

6853553,3,B00Q2WGOAA,"This is a very slow movie. The commentary on the box leads one to think it is a comedy, but the humor is very subtle. There is a small crisis during a family vacation. This makes both partners aware of how they have been role playing through their marriage. Both partners re examine who they are and who they are pretending to be most of the time.

Some alternative paths are right in front of them. For the Mom, it's a chance woman acquaintance also vacationing. She is having a good time with her open marriage on her vacation without her husband and kids. This both fascinates and ultimately repels the Mom.

For the Dad, it's his friend who's divorced and on vacation with his much younger girlfriend. It is a awkward, you get the impression one of the reasons they are no longer as close as before is that one is still a disconnected family man, while the other has left the ex and family behind for a different life. But that divorced single life also has it's own problems. The friend attempts to help him through the aftermath of the incident. They seem to know from their past histories he doesn't really want to follow his friends way, but the Dad don't quite know how to extricate him from the relationship hole he has helped dig.

They both sort of get over it after too much drama by Dad and realization it is bad for their kids.. They implicitly reject the other lives shown to them. These partners are too limited and timid for such dramatic changes in their lives. They don't really want to be free. In some fashion they seem to decide to keep going as a family. Dad gets to reaffirm his authority by ""rescuing"" Mom in front of the kids. Mom makes her own panicked decision to get off a scary bus ride....and Dad backs her up, bringing the kids with him. This relationship only works with a dose of traditional gender roles, even if they don't quite fit perfectly. What is silently acknowledged is that both the parents and the kids feel more comfortable and secure as an imperfect family unit than as the alternatives.

After the incident things have loosened up a bit. Int he final scene, Mom asks a the husband's friend to help carry one of the kids during the long walk down the mountain. Dad tells the truth when his son asks him if he smokes. It's progress of a sort. The Mom and the family unit can't do it all alone, and  Dad isn't pretending quite as much to before. They've  become slightly more human and weaker, and slightly less plastic. The version I saw of this was either dubbed or a version with the actors speaking their own Swedish English. We turned on the subtitles just to help out with the occasional oddly pronounced word. This movie is ok for a slow rainy day. Don't expect much excitement.",1428969600,,2731,4.441117764471058

What is superb about this movie is that it goes way beyond stimulating the viewer to ask, ""What would I do in an avalanche?,"" which is where I think a lot of American movies would stop. This film is really about the fundamental yet implicit 'contracts' we forge in our most central relationships, and what psychological means we are willing to invoke to maintain those hidden agreements.",1427587200,,563,5.130434782608695
6853564,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"Wow. How would you feel if in the moment of disaster -- it's an avalanche here, but it could be any disaster, a fire, tsunami, earthquake, armed robbery -- you see your husband run for his life without a thought to you or your children? What if you're a child and you see your father run away, leaving you behind so he can save himself?

This is the event that cannot be buried, as much as everybody tries to go on as though nothing happened. At least, at first. The wife's anger, confusion, shame, and her sense of betrayal cause her to question everything she believed about her comfortable, luxurious, rather complacent, and happy identity as mother and wife. If the movie ended there, it would be a powerful story. But it doesn't stop. The story keeps digging, investigating.

And just when you're starting to think the wife is ""right"" and the husband is a ba$tard, the story takes another turn, and we get to see things from the husband's side. He, too, is confused and ashamed by this event. Paralyzed by shame, he is completely unable to feel or express any emotion except denial about what has happened. His story is of a modern man stuck inside the entrenched culture of masculinity and his own primal biological male instincts, instincts which even his 'better,' conscious, sensitive, post-modern self cannot override. When he has a kind of emotional break through -- which looks a lot like a break DOWN -- in which he is finally able to speak honestly to his wife, it is she who shuts down. She can't handle her husband not abiding by the masculine norms of how she thinks a husband and father should act. She tells him to shush, to stop it, to get a grip -- basically, to go back to what he was before: shut down by shame, male pride, and inaccessible. She can't quite handle her husband having... god forbid... complex feelings of his own!  In the end, it is a strange, almost ritualistic acting out of very traditional gender roles -- woman as damsel in distress and man as manly rescuer -- that appears to put family dynamics, and family life, back in good order: they are skiiing and the wife disappears briefly; the husband goes to fetch her, carrying her back, injured. Only, when he puts her down, she's perfectly capable of walking on her own and doesn't actually appear injured at all. Was this a test? Did she fake being injured just to see if her husband would ""save"" her? You will have your own ideas about the conclusion, but for me, it seemed like the husband reached some new level of change and honesty by his 'break down.' (That's how I interpret his taking a smoke and answering honestly when asked by his son if he smokes.) Whereas the wife, it seems she regresses even deeper into her traditional identity of a damsel in distress, a woman who sees danger everywhere and must constantly test being rescued. This movie will definitely provoke thoughts and conversation, and you may come away with totally different thoughts. A film that can do that is exciting in my book! Beautiful sound mix and photography, too.",1427328000,2,3044,4.602209944751381

6853566,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"Im a good father.  I know this.  I don't need anyone to tell me this for me to know it.  Im also not a perfect father.  I know this.  I don't need anyone to tell me this for me to know it.  Being a good father does not mean you are perfect.  In fact, Im going to tell you a story.

Two years ago, my family went on vacation.  We rented a boat and we went out on the ocean and we looked for dolphins and we floored it head on into waves and we just had a great timeuntil something happened.  The boat hit a swell and the whole front end was engulfed by the ocean.  It looked, for a brief moment, like we were going to sink.  My whole family was on this boat.  My wife, my daughters, my father and mother.  In a flash of panic, I did something wrong.  I ran to the other end of the boat.  I fled from the wave, leaving my wife and one of my daughters (who were seated near me) to get drenched completely.

No one died.  It was false panic.  The boat flooded and then quickly wasunflooded (not a word, I know) and everyone was safe and sound, and my daughter who was completely soaked thought the whole experience was fun.

Thankfully my wife laughed it off and didn't make me feel awful about it.

Force Majeure tells the story of a family, Tomas and Ebba and their two children, on holiday in France.  They are at a ski resort, taking on the slopes as a family.  One day, at lunch, the family experiences a contained avalanche that, for a brief moment, looks like its not so contained and is about to kill everyone.  In a panic, Tomas flees.  He grabs his phone off the table and books it out of there, leaving his wife and children behind.  No one was hurt, everything was fine in the end, but the situation shakes this family to its core as Ebba starts to question her husbands actions, picking at them, unnerved by them, feeling abandoned because of them, and this sends Tomas into a downward spiral of guilt and near madness as he starts to completely unravel.

Force Majeure asks a lot of poignant questions about relationships and the way that we can perceive actions of others if weve never been in their shoes.  Its so easy to dissect a mistake when we have a different reaction, and yet how would we feel if we were on the other end, if we were the one being dissected?

What I took away from this film so completely was that I personally want to strive to give people the benefit of the doubt.  Ive been there, sat back and analyzed another person, spoken against their actions, adopted my own assumptions about their nature and uttered those ridiculous words well I would have done it differently.  Yes, they are ridiculous words, because unless we have already done it differently, we don't know that is what we would have done.  Situations, moments, are also always exclusive to one another.  A person who is heroic in one instance could, and most likely will, react differently in a similar circumstance because every single event is isolated and our reactions are always a result of various elements.  The film also shows how we can allow ourselves to become affected by others perception of us, allowing it to completely unravel us, even second guessing what we already know about our nature.  Tomas exits the situation unshaken, and yet as his wife starts to pick, dig, pry, accuse and attack, he starts to come undone.  He starts to believe her.  He starts to break apart, tearing at his own actions and feeling as though she is right and he is a failure.

Another aspect of this film that I find alarmingly acute is the way that it attacks gender roles, or explores them through the attack of them, especially within the family dynamic.  Tomas is supposed to be the hero, the savior of his family, and in the eyes of his wife, he has failed.  Tomas is not afforded the opportunity for mistake because this is not the man he is supposed to be.  Even his own guilt is met with a near distain.  How dare he crumblehow dare he fall apart?

But when the shoe is on the other foot

Force Majeure is a tremendous film that explores aspects of relationships that we often take for granted, we live with and push aside and never really stop and say wait a second because its a part of life.  We are expected to be a certain way, and when we fall off from that expectation, we are met with criticism.  The question remains; can you say for certain that you wouldnt have done the same thing?

6853573,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"I saw this as an intensely spiritual movie.  It is first, foremost, and thoroughly an exploration of selfishness.  Everyone has their chance to be selfish, the vacation is geared for the selfish.  The children are learning to live for diversion and enjoyment; the skiing, wine, ipads.  The married women explore turning to extramarital sex to indulge themselves, the selfishness of the bearded brother is exposed by his young girlfriend (who he has left his family for). The one man who is not satisfying the need for diversion is the worker dude with the vacuum cleaner who looks on as a silent, knowing judge, a savior of sorts who they must turn to when they are locked out; he has the universal key to the room.  The movie highlights the consequences of putting oneself first, always, and how devastating to each in turn this life is.  The cold and barren landscape brings the point home of the loneliness of fullfilling desires, putting one's safety and comfort above all others.  Even the mother, who seems to see through this and judge her husband for his selfishness, in turn becomes the most selfish of all as she bails out of the cliff-hanging bus, leaving her children and husband behind in the same ""save myself first"" way her husband responded during the avalanche.  This is a beautiful, deep, and extraordinarily thoughtful commentary on an age old spiritual dilemma: to live for oneself and one's desires, or to live and give all to others.  It is a spiritual quandary that's been around for millenia; instead of Roman Empire excess, we have modern day ipad/luxury ski trip/wine and leather couch excess showcased.  Same essential question.

6853578,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"The avalanche, of course, is a metaphor for human relationships, the way each of us and groups of us live in today's culture. Not very well, I think. The children are the most aware that an avalanche is coming upon them. The adults, the grownups, are so inhibited by their egotistic assessments of themselves, especially the men, that they are unable to be honest with themselves about themselves as well as others, and unable to empathize with truth in order to make honesty the main driving force in their relationship with themselves and in their relationship with others, especially with women. The women, of course, are more aware of this problem. The ending of the film seemed to me to be a bit too heavy and contrived. Getting off the track that we share with all others gives us a better chance to find our way as we need to. But the wife's dash to save herself, never mind the others, in balance with the husband's behavior when the avalanche hits the restaurant early in the film, makes dramatic sense but did not convince me. A second viewing might change that for me. There are many subtleties in the film that did provide a dramatic buildup for this behavior on her part.

The camera never moves in any direction on a wheeled dolly. And the cameraman never moves while the camera is in his hands or is secured to his body with a steadicam harness.

6853609,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"""Force Majeure"", a Jury Prize winner at Cannes, is an authentic masterpiece by Swedish director Ruben stlund that is profoundly rich in dissecting the relationship between a man and wife who go to an opulent ski lodge in the French Alps for a week's vacation with their children.

After an avalanche traumatizes their family, the film becomes uncompromising in its microscopic study of the underlying growing cracks in their marriage. Much more a truthful and incisive examination of the institution of marriage than the shallow if entertaining melodramatics of ""Gone Girl"", ""Force Majeure"" seems a fusing of a cold and disturbing Michael Haneke art film with a Mozartian domestic comic opera resulting in a magnificent document of the human condition.

Each beautiful frame of ""Force Majeure"" is as carefully composed as a great painting; its sound track is ingeniously crafted like a symphony with rain and wind, iron sounds of the ski lifts, and regular controlled explosions from the slopes; and its editing is as precise as a slow ticking clock as a noose is tightened.

You will probably spend the entire film evaluating your own relationship to your own 'significant other' until you reach the film's unexpected ending when the lighting of one cigarette serves as an important symbol as they tread down a winding mountain road. Painful, provocative, joyous, and very human. One of the year's finest achievements.",1424390400,6,1419,5.160869565217391

This well-crafted film is a fascinating exploration of the contours of a modern intimate relationship.  The drama is subtle (not very much actually happens), but if you pay attention to the way the characters interact, you'll observe how partners behave and communicate in ways that erode the bonds of trust that hold their relationships together.  It's an unflinching look at how a marriage can fall apart.

Because the characters are complex and realistic, and the dialog and interactions are subtle, what's actually going on is open to interpretation.  What you see and what you think it means will likely be a reflection of your own gender stereotypes, attitudes, and beliefs about how to interact with a partner when differences arise.  If you're open to it, the film is extremely thought-provoking, providing a wealth of insight for consideration.

That said, here's what I saw...

A young, affluent Swedish couple is on a skiing vacation with their kids.  By all appearances, they have it all together: they are fit, attractive with two beautiful children. They seem to care for each other and their kids.  But under the surface, all is not well.

She has an underlying mistrust and resentment of her husband for working too much and not paying enough attention to her and the family.  We know this from a snide remark she makes to another hotel guest when they first check in.

For his part, he seems to be somewhat disconnected; going through the motions of a skiing vacation with his family because that is what is on his agenda right now.  He is superficially present, but we see no real joy or passion in his interactions with his family or kids.

Then the key event comes.... the family is enjoying a meal on the outdoor terrace of a restaurant overlooking the mountains.  An avalanche begins in the distance.  The wife and children immediately look to the father to tell them what it means and whether they are in danger.  He, of course, has no idea, but does what is expected and reassures his family that they are safe, that it's a controlled avalanche, and ""they know what they are doing"".  To reassure his family, he starts filming the event.  But as the avalanche gets larger and speeds toward them, doubts and fears grow.  Mother holds daughter while father holds on to son.  Then at the last second when it appears certain the avalanche will overcome them, the son breaks loose and the father grabs his phone and turns to run, leaving his family behind...

Everything is white for a few seconds, but it's just from the spray of the snow.  The avalanche has in fact stopped short of them.  The father returns a few seconds later to find his family (who had not run) and everyone is fine.  Except they're not.

The wife is clearly upset and cold to her husband the rest of the day.  Yet, when he asks her if she is irritated, she denies it.  Then, at dinner with another couple that night, she tells them how he ran away from his family in the critical moment of danger.  He is clearly shocked and embarrassed and denies her version.  An argument in front of the other couple ensues.

They argue again later that night.  He claims they have two different versions of what happened.  She wants him to admit that her version was what really happened.  When he won't, she gives up her version, or at least claims to.

But the next night, when their friends come to visit, she insists on telling the whole story of his cowardice in full detail.  He at first ignores it.  Then when pressed, he gets defensive and denies it.  But she won't let it go, and proceeds to show the video of the event to prove that at the moment of truth, he turned and ran from his family.  Shamed and embarrassed, he finally admits that the video makes it look that way.

Meanwhile, the other couple is embarrassed to have been brought into this intimate drama.  They try to smooth things over, with the man  offering reasonable explanations for the husband's actions.  But later, they have an argument as well, after the woman suggests that he too probably would have run under the circumstances.

As the vacation grinds on, the wife continues to give her husband the cold shoulder, preferring to spend time without him.  Finally, he can bear it no longer.  He breaks down and confesses to his wife that he is not the man he wishes he were, but is often the ""victim of his impulses"".  As he begins to cry, he seeks solace from his wife, but she is not sympathetic, at one point telling him to ""shut the f--- up"".  It seems she interprets his attempt at vulnerability as just another part of his cowardice, and instead of bringing them together, it just drives them further apart.

On the final day, the husband has a chance to redeem himself as he takes his family on a ski run under adverse weather conditions.  He tries hard to act ""fatherly"" and make sure everyone is safe.  He even gets to play ""hero"" when his wife falls behind and needs his help.  When everyone is reunited, he proudly exclaims, ""We made it!""  And maybe they have.

There is an interesting final scene.  When their bus driver is having trouble negotiating the switchbacks of the narrow mountain road, the wife becomes fearful and agitated, finally demanding to be let off the bus.  As the door opens, the wife runs off the bus, leaving her family and friends behind.  Now it's up to the husband to calmly gather the kids and lead them off the bus.

It's hard to know what any of us would do in a fearful situation where we felt our survival threatened.  But relationships are held together by trust.  So when challenged, it's important to nourish and try to rebuild those bonds of trust rather than corrode them.

At least that is the message I got from the film.  Yours may be different.",1424131200,13,5771,4.597058823529411

6853614,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"If you ever wondered how a marriage or a relationship would fare after traumatic circumstances, this is the film to help sort it out.

 Swedish filmmaker Ruben Ostland has given us a force to be sure. A Swedish family, on vacation in the French Alps for five days. Each day is presented and the activities played out. On day one, the perfect family, momma, poppa, daughter and son have their photos taken while in their fashionable ski togs. All is well. Day two while at lunch a controlled Avalanche suddenly looks like it has become uncontrolled, and everyone at the outside patio screams. However, something is not right with this family, and from day two through day five they try to ingest this experience.

This is such a well crafted film that leaves us with bewilderment wondering just how would we react in such a situation. The family falls apart, and tries to put itself back together again. Of note, it has been shown that families who experience severe trauma of some sort often come apart forever. Each day in this film gives us a different perspective of the characters. We are observers to this trauma and we are left wondering how would we react. Fascinating and enjoyable and complex.

6853618,4,B00Q2WGOAA,"As I continue to play catch-up on 2014 in time for the Oscars, I took the opportunity tonight to watch the Swedish film, FORCE MAJEURE. The second definition in the Oxford Dictionary for ""force majeure"" is ""irresistible compulsion or greater force."" While an obvious connection can be made to the avalanche which occurs in the film, and is a pivotal moment for the family at the center of the story, it also works as a metaphor for the husband's instinctual reaction towards it. Thematically, the film deals with issues like familial bonds, masculinity and control (or the lack thereof). This was a human drama, first and foremost, and I thought it did an excellent job at dealing with these questions. At the end of the day there aren't any concrete answers given, and while some might feel cheated, I thought it was very judicious of the filmmakers to leave things up for interpretation and just present the story as is. There were also a number of excellent scenes which neatly captured the discussion they seemed to be going for. Among them were a pair of scenes in which the wife recalls to friends (with her husband present) how things went down during the avalanche. The second of these was rather intense and just further indicated how much it affected both of them. Other elements which stood out to me was the use of Vivaldi's Summer movement from the ""The Four Seasons"" as a musical motif. Perhaps ironic considering the winter weather, I also thought it added to dramatic tension and created a sense of impending doom, i.e., an oncoming storm. The only downside I could really find were the two actors who played the children. While they weren't in too many of the scenes, or at least didn't have that much dialogue, I thought the moments when they panicked and screamed were unbearably annoying and screechy. Overall, I thought this was a well-made and well-acted film that explored some really interesting themes with humor, sensitivity and balance. The typical moviegoer probably wouldn't give this a second glance, but for those with more discerning tastes I feel like this could be a rewarding, cathartic experience.",1422144000,12,2133,4.862637362637362

In short, it presents a seemingly perfect family with a big problem and we see how they work through it together and also at times, alone. The kids are really incredible and the story is totally believable. And it made me wonder what I'd do in the same circumstance. It seems really easy to judge the dad for running away from danger instead of staying and protecting the family, but it also does a good job at saying, ""well, you never really know what you're going to do unless/until it happens and you're in it"" (although I know in fight or flight, I've never been one to flee!). It was worth the money and I am glad I saw the movie. I hope you like it as much as I did. I do know that this movie got passed over for an Oscar nomination.

6853628,5,B00Q2WGOAA,"What's interesting about this movie is that it's able to use a mundane occurrence such as a controlled avalanche at a ski resort and turn it into something that festers at the insides of a family. The avalanche is a metaphor of something that grows out of control. When the father runs away from this harmless avalanche caused by the ski resort, leaving his family behind (while taking his phone and camera with him), this causes a rift between him and his family. His image of a protective figure is destroyed. It's replaced by that of a selfish, coward. The rest of the movie shows how they deal with his disgrace.

Their respect for him and the way he deals with the aftermath (denying his actions) further increase the distance between him and his wife which in turn causes their children to be distraught. Other small problems begin to have greater significance because of the psychological trauma from the first event.

The acting is really superb; it would need to be for a subtle film like this where the biggest drama and turmoil occur within people. Many of the problems the family faces are mundane and yet totally gripping. It's beautifully written in how well it shows that. There were several scenes that were really memorable because it shows how seemingly everyday problems can belie serious internal tension. The title not only references the force of the self-preservation instinct which overcame the father's desire to protect his family but also the feelings his wife felt about him. Despite knowing that it was just a moment of instinctual weakness, she can't help but be disgusted by it and this leads to trouble within the whole family. The force of those feelings is too strong overcoming rationality and the sympathy she had for him. The end was also really unique; it was well acted/written/directed and redeems the father in a somewhat ambiguous way.",1420416000,6,1877,4.844236760124611

Force majeure means ""superior force"" in French but is also known as cas fortuit or casus fortuitus in Latin, which translates as ""chance occurrence, unavoidable accident."" Indeed, Ruben stlund's new Swedish drama features an inciting incident in the form of an avalanche, which greatly disturbs the relationship between husband and wife Tomas and Ebba, who are visiting a ski resort in the French Alps with their two young children.

While the family is eating lunch on a sun deck at a restaurant, Tomas assumes that what's coming toward them is a 'controlled avalanche', but when the blizzard envelopes the diners, he's the first to flee, leaving his wife and children to fend for themselves. As it turns out, the snow only reaches the resort in the form of a mist, and a couple of minutes later, everything is back to normal.

Ebba is furious at Tomas for what she perceives as his cowardice, leaving his children unprotected in a great time of crisis. She isn't afraid to embarrass Tomas by describing the incident to a couple whom they've just met at the resort. Tomas, however, denies that he ran and insists it's simply a matter of different perceptions of what occurred.

Tomas' denial infuriates Ebba even more and she again brings up the subject in front of Mats, an old friend who's also there at the resort, along with his much younger girlfriend, Fanni. Mats attempts to defend Tomas by stating that in times of crisis, one doesn't necessarily act rationally while in 'panic mode'. But when Ebba points out that Tomas filmed the incident with his cell phone, she insists that the offending incident on video be played. Sure enough, there is incontrovertible evidence that Tomas indeed fled the scene and can no longer refute his wife's claims.

As a result, Tomas withdraws into a great depression. While on the slope, Mats encourages him to let his feelings out with his voice, noting that he's pent up with rage. Tomas' 'venting' on the slope is reminiscent of the 'Primal Scream' therapy of the 60s. This leads him to break down in front of his family back at the room at the hotel and he's able to sob uncontrollably. Notably, Ebba is embarrassed by the expression of all those pent-up emotions in contrast to the children, who hug their father while he's going through this catharsis.

Tomas is a new man--or is he? One wonders why he takes the family up on the ski slope in dangerous blinding blizzard conditions. Perhaps he wants to prove to himself that he can protect them in the event of an emergency--and indeed, when Ebba loses her way on the slope, Tomas rescues her. The thought occurred to me that Ebba lost her way on purpose in order to create the opportunity for Tomas to save her. Whatever the case, we can now conclude that the crisis in regards to Tomas' masculinity is over and he has restored equilibrium in that regard.

The Force Majeure denouement adds an ambiguous coda to the previous proceedings. After leaving the resort, an erratic bus driver leads Ebba to fear for her life and now she's the one who's in full panic mode, leaving the bus without her children. It's another 'chance occurrence' where the normally controlled (and controlling) Ebba, finds herself quite out of control. Has she gotten her comeuppance or was she justified in panicking, in the face of that seemingly crazed driver? We note that one of the women that Ebba had met and talked to back at the resort, remains on the bus with the driver. Earlier, she had made it clear that she enjoyed taking chances, especially in regards to the idea of an open marriage, in striking contrast to Ebba, who couldn't countenance such actions, outside the more staid bourgeoisie union, which she had cultivated for so long with husband Tomas.

What can we conclude from Ebba's actions? Some internet posters have suggested that she is now intent on abandoning her family. As they walk down the road, she asks Mats to hold her daughter. Did she 'overreact' about the bus driver, since the woman who approved of open marriage, didn't feel at all in danger and remained on the bus? Quite possibly. An earlier scene, in which Ebba abandons the family on the ski slope, would also suggest that she's ready to call it quits with Tomas. As for the intrepid husband, when he admits that he smokes to the boy while walking down the road, it's clear that he no longer puts on any pretenses as to who he is.

'Force Majeure' falls under the appellation of the 'interesting' film. There's much food for thought here as one attempts to decipher the film's underlying meaning. The film's weakness is the lack of judicious editing, causing it to often move along at a glacial pace. I could have done without some of the long-winded visuals as their presence was detrimental to the narrative's overall fluidity.",1420329600,,4837,4.741973840665874
