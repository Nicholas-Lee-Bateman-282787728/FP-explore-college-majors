782219,2,6304113390,"I don't understand the fact that in Harem, everyone fears the dreaded Sultan, who governs with an iron fist. Everyone that is, except Nancy. She is his concubine, a woman captured and presented to the sultan for his  carnal amusement, and yet she speaks to him as if he were the subserviant  one? She teases and taunts him that in order for her to sleep with him, she  would""have to be married""!  This is asinine given her position.  She basically avoids his bed until he can wait no longer. ""What I  want...is to be alone with this woman"" And then takes her in his arms,  and tells her,""You really have no choice."" He then looks down at  her ample bosom, and proceeds to nuzzle it. Then as the last of Jessica's  time slips away, a bomb explodes. He is called away, and Jessica escapes.  Later on he finds her sleeping with her love interest in the movie and has  her drown. She not only escapes, she actually subdues the sultan into  surrender and some kind of a peace treaty! This was truly the Thelma and  Louise of 1986. The two lead characters do not even share a kiss, even  though their 2 seconds of a love scene do heat up the screen. But it is  like a grain of sand in an ocean. Travis is a competent actress and quite  beautiful, however, she was miscast. Heather Thomas or even Tanya Roberts  would have been perfect. Omar was perfectly cast, but his character was  spineless. Given this role today with perhaps an Ashley Judd or a Sarah  Gellar as Jessica, and a fearless director/screenwriter and an NC-17  rating, a huge blockbuster could be brought to the screen. Of course the  actresses would have to consent to being nude in the picture more than  Emmannuel Beart was in La Belle Noiseusse, and would have to have no fear  of strong scenes of sexuality in order for the film to work.",949622400,4,1802,4.426829268292683
782220,1,6304113390,"Harem is a silly film for several reasons including it is insulting and eurocentric.  Chalk up another Victorian heavy breather to a simplistic storyline that finds the Anglo-English virgin the center of yet another  cloistered harem fantasy in which the white women rule the roost.  And what  a roost, Ava Gardner as the first wife, aging but still beautiful, she is  second banana to Cherie Lughi and Nancy Travers -- in their dreams! The  evil rooster in the competitive hen house is Omar Shariff, a waste of  talent as is Gardner.  Art Malik manages to bring some humor and dignity to  the role of stereotypic eastern male, but again, the mindset that brought  this film to the screen is dated. Not one for the video library.",947030400,6,729,4.714285714285714

782430,5,6304113390,I love this movie and watch it frequently. However my VHS version is developing problems  I went to my 'go to' site to order a DVD.

782431,5,6304113390,"This is a very rare, hard to find movie / TV miniseries.  Please note is is NOT the 1985 theatrical release with Nastassja Kinski and Ben Kingsley.

Nancy Travis stars in one of her first roles along with Omar Sharif and a host of good actors... top flight production design, cinematography, and especially wardrobe make this movie an enjoyable look back at the 80s between the Hollywood golden age and modern film making.  It is 3 hours and gives a feeling of the great miniseries from that era like Shogun.

Also, notably this is Ava Gardners last film.

It's probably about a 3.5 star movie but a previous reviewer gave it 1 star because they ordered the wrong region DVD, which is very unfair to the movie so I'm giving it a 5 star to even it out.

Be aware, as it clearly states in the title... this is a PAL disk which means Europe Middle east Japan, South Africa Greenland / anywhere with UK based televisions... meaning you must have a newer, unrestricted DVD / Blu ray player to play it in the US... these days many are so you probably won't have a problem, but you might check your players manual to make sure.  The description currently says Region 0 which must be wrong as another viewer said it wouldnt play in his player and region 0 disks supposedly play in any player, it must be region 2.

Overall an enjoyable film and look back.",1383609600,2,1347,4.425101214574899

782433,4,6304113390,"Originally presented as a mini-series on TV, HAREM is a piece of fluff set against the background of turn of the (20th) century Victorian England. Nancy Travis as Jessica is the daughter of a prominent diplomat who is engaged to an upper crust Britisher (played by Julian Sands). From the outset, Travis is portrayed as a free spirit who has no desire to adhere to the mores of her time. She rides horses, shoots rifles, and dresses as she pleases.

Her wedding date is suddenly postponed by several months due to the fact that her husband to be has been ordered to the Middle East on diplomatic affairs. The back story to all this is the crumbling Ottoman Empire (a Turkish power that has existed for some 500 years in that part of the world and straddles 3 continents). As an aside, both the British and French couldn't wait to pick the bones of this waning empire and did so right after World War I ended.

The empire is under siege from within. The autocratic Sultan is not particularly liked by his people and his subjects have tired of Constantinople's grip (Istanbul today) which was the capital at that time. Revolution is in the air and the Sultan remains incommunicado from those he rules. Into this scenario comes Jessica & Co. While on a train in the Middle East, they are momentarily accosted by a group of rebels who are not mere bandits (their leader actually turns out to be an Oxford educated individual and speaks excellent English). It is shortly after this encounter that some of the rebels are captured and will be executed by the Sultan unless some worthwhile exchange can be made.

Fast forward: After reaching their destination in Damascus, Jessica decides to visit the ruins of ancient Palmyra (some 130 miles NE of Damascus) with some amateur archaeologists she has met. She is implored not to go but stubbornly decides to go anyway. For those not familiar with the geography and artistic culture of the Ottoman Empire, we have a somewhat interesting story. However, the film was actually shot in Spain and Morocco with one distant view of an Ottoman mosque that probably came from stock footage to indicate Constantinople. That's not to say that the architectural backdrop isn't splendiforous enough. It's just not Turkish.

As expected, Jessica is abducted by rebels while in ""Palmyra"" as a fitting exchange prospect for the previously captured rebels. She is brought to the harem of the Sultan (Omar Sharif) in his fortress
retreat (the exact location seems obscure). She becomes a hit and impresses him with her advice, knowledge, and outspokenness. The Kadin (first wife, played by Ava Gardner) feels threatened and later plots to eliminate her new possible rival. (The story seems to echo the Biblical one of Esther and the King.) For awhile one wonders if love will bloom betwen the Sultan and Jessica. It does eventually bloom between Jessica and her former captor (Art Malik).

Without giving away any spoilers, we have a developing story which involves a final struggle between the Sultan and his opponents, who will Jessica choose as her husband to be, and will the Kadin succeed in accomplishing her goal.

HAREM is a story that could be generic if it weren't for its geographical and chronological setting. It does reflect the typical attitude of the ""West"" towards the ""East"" and could have come right out of a 19th century painting by the French artist Ingres. Sarah Miles, as a bon vivant ""woman of the world"", steals the show with her personal confessions regarding past lovers and her dramatic hats and clothing. Indeed, the garments worn by all are second only to the scenery. The music by John Scott (Anthony & Cleopatra; The Final Countdown, etc.) is a major contribution to this production
and provides all the necessary themes to recreate the flavor of the ""East"", the harem, and romance. In fact, the music might be the most noteworthy thing about this film but unfortunately has never been separately recorded. The DVD looks more like a high quality video copy than an actual
digital recording.",1371772800,,4045,4.838150289017341

782511,5,6304113390,"If you wish to get a glimpse of a Sultan's palace, and his harem of beautiful ladies, and see how they all lived, then this movie is just for you! It is a very romantic, sensual story, with lots of action, and adventure, and drama; men and women both, would like this movie! This movie also, has a all-star cast of outstanding actors: OMAR SHARIF as the Sultan; and AVA GARDNER as the Sultan's first wife!

This is a story about Jessica(NANCY TRAVIS); a innocent young woman, who is very beautiful and headstrong, and very spirited; who travels on a long journey, to the exotic land of the desert sands, with her father and fiance.

While traveling, Jessica is looking out the train window, when she sees this very handsome Turkish, Bedouin (ART MALIK), covered in flowing robes, riding a beautiful stallion, with a group of Turkish, revolutionaries, and they overtake the train, and one of the men sees Jessica, and tells the handsome Bedouin, (who happens to be their leader with a just cause) about how pretty Jessica is, and that they could trade her to the Sultan's harem, to help in their fight for freedom and to help save their men; while everyone knows the Sultan loves pretty women!

The men end up kidnapping Jessica, and the sparks fly when the handsome Bedouin, and Jessica meet. He is strongly attracted to Jessica, but Jessica is placed in the Sultan's harem, and she enters a new world, and the women of the harem teach Jessica how to please the Sultan, and how to behave in this beautiful, but very dangerous place; especially when the Sultan and his first wife hold life or death in the palm of their hand, and your life depends on what mood that they are in, and on whether they like you or not, or especially when they feel that you may be a serious threat to them!

When the Sultan finally sees Jessica, he is smitten, and then rumors start flying that he is ready for another wife! While Jessica's fiance is trying so hard to get her released; he then gets help from a very important lady that helps him find Jessica, and this lady also knows someone that can sneak into the Sultan's palace undetected, and that someone is that handsome Bedouin, who kidnapped Jessica in the first place, and he goes in disguise in the palace and falls in love with Jessica, and he risks his life to save Jessica and his men, Ladies! you will love Tarek's,(the handsome Bedouin's)compelling brown eyes, and his beautiful deep voice! And Guys! you will love Jessica's awesome beauty and courage!

I also loved the lavish beautiful clothes and robes, and the beautiful palace with those pools of water covered in rose petals! The music to this movie was perfect for it, and I highly recommend this movie!",1250812800,8,2707,4.596273291925466

782513,4,6304113390,"I enjoyed this seemingly made for TV movie when I saw it back in 1990. I discovered afterward there was another movie with the title of Harem made the same year (1985-86) and starring Nastassja Kinski. That one was a bit darker, but also enjoyable.
I had already seen Nancy Travis, the starlet of this Harem, in the Richard Gere cop thriller Internal Affairs, and in a bit part in Married to the Mob, so at the time she was babelicious.
It's become a common plot, in these types of movies, to have a beautiful western woman kidnapped by a lustful or politically-motivated sultan or sheik (I think of the excellent The Wind and the Lion, the surreal The Sheltering Sky, then Sahara and a bunch of lesser movies). But Harem executes this plot well - you sympathize for Jessica, the character played by Nancy Travis, you want her fiance to rescue her, and yet you start rooting for her new Bedouin love interest and even feel for the tyrannical sultan, played by Omar Sharif.
Julian Sands plays Jessica's stiff Brit fiance, a turnabout from the dashing and impetuous young lover he played in A Room with a View. You wish he would be a stronger character, but he is so weak-kneed you understand Jessica's fickle betrayal.",1059350400,6,1217,4.612903225806452
