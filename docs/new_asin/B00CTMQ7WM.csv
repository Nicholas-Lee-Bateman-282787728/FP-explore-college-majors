5738671,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"Impossible not to cry with this one.  Very moving and emotional ride from start to finish.  The great duets sure don't hurt either.

I highly recommend this movie and the soundtrack.",1391817600,4,182,4.806451612903226
5738672,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"This movie is a must-watch for anyone who shares a passion for the religion debate or the separation of church and state.  Aside from the absolutely AMAZING soundtrack, the plot line is solid with a unique time depiction.  There are a few spots where it's hard to pinpoint whether or not a scene is a flashback, but you'll get it.  No way a movie like this would have ever been written in the US because of its logical anti-religion stance.",1391817600,10,440,4.475
5738673,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"On the face of it, this is a simple and alas reasonably common tale : - man and woman meet, fall in love, have a time of bliss, and a child, who intensifies and changes their bliss, and then some tragedy strikes the child, and everything is changed utterly, and unravels into pain all the way.

This isn't too much of a spoiler, as the opening of the film shows a small child in hospital, being talked through receiving something intravenously, and we see from the parents expressions this is not going to be good, and immediately the viewer knows where we are heading.

Any individual story is only going to work if we engage with the protagonists, though surely a suffering child almost automatically is going to grab most of us by the throat, sinew, gut and heart, squeeze and not let go. I must admit from the very beginning I was short of breath, and saying oh no, no, no

However, there has to be some leaven to get the viewer through this and this Belgian film, directed by Felix van Groeningen,  manages its leaven spectacularly, both in filmic, narrative terms and the excellence of the 3 leads.

Elise (Veerle Baetens) is a quirky young woman who owns a tattoo parlour. She meets Didier (Johan Heldenberg, who also co-wrote the script) a blue-grass musician in love with America and its country music. The wonderful, intricate music runs through the film, as the band achieves greater success and scenes take in concerts from little smoky dives to larger stadiums.

The structure of the film (and it works stunningly) is non-linear, as over 7 years of relationship cuts between different moments of past and present. The audience is pretty well in the know of what happens next all the way through, so what we focus on is the how and the internal psychology of the individuals. Intercut with this is the friction between faith (Elise) and atheism (Didier) and the wider way in which politics, medical research and individual lives collide.

Baetens and Heldenberg offer beautifully raw, real performances, and are un-airbrushed and unsentimental.

However  I mentioned 3 leads  little Nell Cattrysse as Maybelle, Elise and Didiers daughter, will not so much break your heart as rip it in pieces.

No doubt this review is screaming at the more sensitive  avoid, avoid, but, there is real joy and sweetness within it, and the savour and fizz of life, the upsides as well as the downs, are engaged with. The non-linear narrative inserts slivers of the very very good and the very very painful cheek by jowl with each other. And this is how life is.

Belgiums entry for Best Foreign Language film for the 2014 Oscar nominations

5738675,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I never do reviews online, leaving them for people who actually care about reviews, but this movie deserves it. While absolutely heart-breaking, it was one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a long time. And the music: spot on. As a native Alabaman now living in Brooklyn (which has a surprisingly strong bluegrass scene), I was wary of a Dutch movie featuring bluegrass music, but the actors had amazing voices and I found the music to be the backbone of this very hauntingly sad film.",1391731200,140,495,4.636363636363637
5738676,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"This movie does some very unique footage as it goes from the end back to the beginning, sort of like Momento. Their story unfolds like a wild dream, frantic ... where chemistry ignites a passion between lovers. They are pleasured by one another, as if it could be better than we imagine. Of course there is tragedy that interrupts their perennial affair. If you like film, you could like this one.",1389571200,,397,4.605633802816901
5738677,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"Please Note some people consider this review to contain spoilers!

This is the official Belgian entry for the 2014 Oscars best foreign language film and after seeing it I can see why. We meet Didier and Elise they sort of fall for each other at first sight. He invites her to come see his band, who are a Bluegrass outfit and to say they are excellent is a massive understatement.

They move to his cowboy house and start a truly moving love affair which sees her getting pregnant and joining the band who sing American music like they were born to it. Then tragedy strikes and their daughter is diagnosed with cancer. The band have become part of the fabric of all three of the family's lives and as the pressure builds so everything they have in life and love gets called into question. The story is told in a non linear narrative in that it jumps around from time frame to time frame. Each time it does this a little more of the story is revealed - slowly building the full picture. The music is the glue that links the scenes as are the tattoos that Elise's gets done as a permanent reminder of her life and loves for all to see.

To cal this excellent is only half the story; apart from being moving, beautifully acted and filmed it also tells a story with a purpose that includes the lack of stem cell research and the hopelessness that is brought about by a parents worse fear. It unfolds in such a way that you would begrudge missing a single second. It is in Flemish and English with very good sub titles and is probably one of the most moving films I have seen this year - I can only absolutely recommend this wonderful film.",1387756800,73,1635,4.336601307189542
5738678,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"""The Broken Circle Breakdown"" (2012 release from Belgium; 111 min.) brings the story of a young couple in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), Didier and Elise, and how they are coping with the potentially fatal illness that has befallen their 6 year old daughter Maybelle. As the movie opens, we witness a bluegrass band in performance. Turns out that Didier has taken up the banjo and just loves all things American, and in particular Bill Monroe, ""the father of bluegrass"", he reminds us. After the opening credits, the movie immediately takes us into the hospital where Maybelle is being treated for cancer, and right a way you can tell this is going to be a heavy movie. As Didier is trying to keep his composure, Else shushes ""we do our crying at home, here we are positive!"". The movie then jumps back 7 year, to 1999, when Didier and Elise (who owns a tattoo parlor and features a number of large tattoos all over her body) first meet. From there on, the movie jumps back and forth between past, present and even future. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is an emotionally devastating movie, and not one for the faint of heart on top of that. Indeed, emotions are displayed raw and unfiltered, sometimes uncomfortably so. Second, the script manages to beautifully interweave the bluegrass theme (providing a much needed emotional outlet, both for the characters and for us, the viewer) with the family drama itself. Third, the lead performances from Johan Heldenbergh (as Didier; he also co-wrote the script), but even more so Veerle Baetens as Elise will simply blow you away. Baetens displays a vulnerability as the hurting wife and mother that surely will tuck at your heart. She has already won a number of awards in Europe for this performance, and may win yet more. No surprise, this film is the official entry from Belgium for the 2014 Best Foreign Film Oscar. Last but certainly not least, the music does play an important role in the film. I was amazed how well the bluegrass band performs. The original soundtrack is available here on Amazon for anyone interested.

This movie was a runaway success in Belgium and also scored very nicely in a number of other markets. I don't see this happening in the US, as the movie is frankly too downbeat. Nobody watching this is going to walk away thinking ""well, that was a jolly good time!"", but that doesn't mean this movie isn't worth your attention. If you are in the mood for an emotionally taxing viewing experience, I can assure you that you will be rewarded. ""The Broken Circle Breakdown"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

*UPDATE* (Jan '14) This has just gotten an Oscar nomination for the Best Foreign Language Film, and deservedly so.",1386892800,26,2825,4.773006134969325
5738679,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"This movie was very, very good.  It is a foreign film, Belgium I think.  It is a ~Boy meets girl, both fall in love, tragedy strikes~ film.  It is a time shift movie, jumping back in forth.  The time shifts are not too bothersome.  The story is put together pretty solid and told through a series of Bluegrass music selections.  There are some religious factors in the story that may offend some people but I found it relative to the story.  I will not give any spoilers.  It is worth the watch and I will definitely order when available.  I watched it online.  Good foreign film.  Good acting. Music was great.",1386547200,,611,4.414414414414415

5738692,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"The key words for this movie are Death of a beloved daugher, Country music, Love of Tattoo.

There are a lot of people cried over this movie.
For me, this movie also reminded of another film  <Lorenzo's Oil> by George Miller who made <Mad Max: Fury Road> recently.
Two movies are talking about their kids who got sick and try to cure whatever take but fail to do so.
But this movie is even sad because the husband and wife are even giving up eveything after the child's death.
The mother even kills herself by overdosing the medicine.
The husband being left alone couldn't do anything at the end.

You see, the wife acted by Veerle Baetens and won so many best actress award from many film festivals is almost obsessed by having tattoos in her body whenever there is something to be memorized about in her life. Her boyfriend, her life experience. So when she is naked, we can see her beautiful tattooed pictueres from her body which is a pure art.
For me I am not a tattoo lover and if my girlfriend has a tattoo I will rather not like that girl but this woman is an exception.
She was a true beauty, a tattoo art figure.
When two lover are become one, they are like some kind of an art figure itself not some cheap sex shot.

Anyway, one thing the husband did mistake was when the wife tells the husband that she is pregnant, he was kind of hesitated and the wife was upset about it.
Later when the child got sick, she blamed him that it was you who is responsible that she is sick. You didn't wanted the child, are you happy now that she is dying?

We see the girl slowly dying in their care. But she was bright and happy faced untill the very minutes. That even made us more sad since she was thankful to this very nature of life. She was thankful to her parents, to life and to everything. She was positive even if she was vomiting everytime.
When she was a bit better, she was smiling at anything that happens to her.
Those moments, the mother and father will never forget.
And because of that, the mother at the end happens to overdosed.

This is the movie that was made in Netherlands and it was a sad and beautiful tale that you should watch.",1466812800,,2151,4.2727272727272725

However, as the movie progressed I became more and more saddened by the dialogue, the scenes of screaming obcenities at each other, blaming each other for what happend etc. I was mostly disturbed how the main actor blamed God, President Bush and anyone who stood for morality, sanctity of life, as an assl**** and worse! The story showed how people who have no hope, no one to call out to when they are hurting the most, take the most drastic action to erase the pain and sorrow they are experiencing.

5738732,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I wasn't sure whether I would like this film or not.  It sounded depressing from the jacket blurb.  I found it memorable.  It certainly is an unusual production.  In the tradition of European classics this manages to mix the personal and the universal to a fine stir: Europe, America, religion, science, politics, love, grief, depression, joy--and of course, the music.  Plus you get to learn the name of one of the finest bluegrass musicians recorded [for real].  These are professional actors so it appears they lip-synched the music which was performed by a truly fine band.
You can read the basics anywhere: that Didier and Elise fall in love, marry, have a child, and the girl develops leukemia.  Both of them are somewhat counter-culture: Didier owns farmland and an old house badly in need of renovation, and sings in a bluegrass band [in English].  Elise runs a tattoo parlour.  There's a very high rate of divorce in couples who lose a child to cancer.  Their daughter's cancer eventually tears their relationship apart hence the title, which starts with the country song going ""May the circle be unbroken in the sky Lord in the sky"", and the breakdown part is about the marriage.  Despite the depressing sound of this, the movie actually manages to bring the story to a completion, a sort of breakdown-repair in the end.  And if you don't like the story, still there's the music.  Some of the performances alone make the movie worth the watching.  Funny how few mention the ""death sequence"" which appears in the film--by that I mean somewhat like the ""near-death experiences"" we've all heard about, except in this case the person doesn't return.  Also well-done and does not extrapolate unnecessarily.  It was a thoughtful movie.  Yes there's English subtitling for the Flemish dialog but I found that so well done that after a while it seemed like I was hearing it rather than reading it.",1454198400,,1899,4.8478260869565215

5738758,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"If you had no notion that you might be in the mood for a Belgian love story with incredible emotional range, rich in symbolism, spoken in Flemish with English subtitles, involving a beautiful tattoo artist and a lanky bearded musician and their precious very sick child, set to a bluegrass track, just settle in and surprise yourself. These diverse elements combine in a just right fit to tell this loving and agonizing story. If you didn't have a yen for bluegrass, this might make you a major, at least a minor, fan. This ensemble is brilliant (both strings and voices, the latter in flawless English). The music, some melancholy ballads some upbeat classic bluegrass, teamed with the excellent acting, merges with and heightens emotion -- sadness ,grief, melancholy, spiritual zeal, pure joy. The jolts of anger are unaccompanied. The co-author of the play from which the movie was adapted, Johan Heldenbergh, also plays Didier, one of the leads. Veerle Baetens plays Elise. Both are startlingly good and authentic. The one small lingering question is how did Elise, a tattoo artist who naively sang a bit of a song in an early scene, morph into the dynamite lead singer in the band? The history shuffling is very effective, but I don't recall a precedent for that. The 5 stars stand. The film is that good!",1444435200,3,1310,4.852678571428571

These tensions revolve around Didier/Elise's personal relationship, and how Maybelle, their daughter,  impacts.

It has the same emotional honesty and intensity that is so true and so universal that the two worldsAmerican Country Music and European love of that musiccomes together in a way that is always entertaining and very moving.

You burn the hell out of your mouth, but you don't spit it out.  You take little nips around the edge hoping you don't have to dilute the wonderful taste with cold water, but eventually, it's so hot you do, anyway.  You get smarter and let it cool, but you come back and, not just finish it, but relish every bite--which would have tasted better if you hadn't burned your tongue in the first place.

5738808,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"Powerful story line, well acted ... initially a love story that ends in gut wrenching tragedy.  The presumed locale is Belgium where the story follows the lives of a couple who lose an initially unwanted child to leukemia.  The man is sort of a rough-edged cowboy who makes a living leading a group that does American bluegrass/country music, initially in bars and later in more refined venues.  The woman is a tattoo artist and also a bit of a renegade who eventually becomes a significant part of the singing entourage.  The professional lives of the couple get little more than periodic passing notice as the story focuses on the couple's ups and downs dealing with the child's illness, where everything eventually spirals out of control with the child's death.  The handling of the back and forth in time employed for the story line is the major weakness I found with the movie, since in a number of instances it confuses the underlying content.  I'm also going to pick on a production faux pas where the man has a red pick up truck that fails to age at all over the 10 years or so of time represented in the movie.

I bought it because I like Bluegrass music and I was intrigued by film clips  from the movie that I had seen  on YouTube.  I am still thinking about the film today and admit to having paused about 1/4 of the way through my third viewing.  I agree with the reviewers who gave the movie 5 stars, and I have read a great number of them. I will add one singular observation.  I know this film is great because one year, five years , or 15 years from now, I will still remember it in great detail. I slept but 3 hours after watching this film and today I am left feeling numb and enervated.  Yet I still have a strong urge to watch it a third time in the very near future. Even though it is out on DVD and available on Netflix, someone will hopefully promote this film and bring it to mainstream theaters throughout the USA.  Good as the film was on my 42 inch flat screen I would drive 30 or 40 miles to see it on the Big Screen were the opportunity available. Five stars for this film  are insufficient but since it's the maximum allowed, that is what it gets.

5738830,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"This is very moving, well-done and, indeed, artistic film.  (Read the rest after seeing the film.)  The title, which should be Unbroken Circle Breakdown, is based on the Country Music standard.  The country music here is excellent--and I don't usually like country music.  The film makes much of the irony of the music's being done by a Belgian band.  I particularly enjoyed the irony of the Belgians singing ""I've got country in my genes.""  In fact, the lyrics often juxtapose ironically with the action, especially at the end when the two principals are singing about how they will always be there for each other--after having split and before savaging each other.  These are folks who love the music and America--but are permanently at odds with the music's themes and America's values--even as they live lives that, ironically, are the stuff of the Country Music genre.  The story is told out of sequence, but it is so skillfully cut that the events from different times advance the narrative.  About a half hour from the end, the nearly final event begins to cut into the action.  This creates the sense of impending doom.  It is artistic, but I realize that it actually masks a plot defect.  At the heart of the story is a torrid love affair of the principals that produces a daughter. (They marry and raise her.)  At 7, she develops cancer.  Various treatments are tried and fail.  She dies about half-way through the film.  The rest of the film is about how her parents' grief tear them apart and ultimately destroy them.  We discover that he is a rabid materialist and she is a new ager. It is painful to watch them each go after the other for the way the other handles the tragedy.  As I said, the editing makes destruction seem inevitable, but what they do to each other is just stupid and barely credible.  The father bizarrely concludes that George Bush is responsible for his daughter's death by prohibiting stem cell research and is grotesquely intolerant of the mother's belief in reincarnation.  She resents his resentment.  The situation resembles the film Ordinary People, but the conflict here is ideological. It is hard to imagine Americans being so stupid and immature in this way--though we have our own nonsense.  I suppose the film is supposed to undermine the ""hopeful in the face of tragedy"" message of country music (and maybe of America), but it seems to me to show, sadly and ironically, what happens to people who reject this message.",1423785600,,2465,4.777777777777778
5738831,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"This was an unbelievably beautiful film. I'm no expert at cinematic technique or what have you and I don't even know what drew me to write a review in the first place, but I can certainly judge a film by the massive way it makes you feel. And this made me feel everything. It's just an incredible character study of the two leads and the actors involved were so authentic. And it skimmed the surface of the complexities of different ideologies, the romanticization of America, politics, medicine, marriage, all that, yet it didn't come off preachy or like it was trying to cover all these topics at once. No, there was such emotional depth to this film. It's lovely and joyous, with a sweet love story and amazing bluegrass music (just bought the soundtrack!!). It's unbearably sad, many many heartbroken and angry tears shed by me. But it makes you think and it makes you feel and I highly recommend seeing it. One of the best films I've personally seen.

The movie does not give enough information about the main characters to convince me to like them. Frankly, I don't like the man and the woman. The viewer is given a little bit of insight into the little girl when she refuses to give her father the dead bird and then waxes philosophical about what happens to living creatures after they die. That is very touching. I only cared about the little girl, the rest of the characters are uninteresting. There are two many scenes of mom and dad copulating, and the cover photo is absurd, it has nothing to do with the story.

5738853,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"Possibly the best film of the decade, ""Broken Circle Breakdown"" will evoke emotions you may never have experienced.  In the words of young director/producer, Felix van Groenigen, ""this film is an emotional roller coaster."" It is also one that brings the music that I love to the forefront where it belongs.  The discerning viewer will more than likely ""get"" the concept of the circle of life.  The term ""Breakdown"" comes from the bluegrass tradition where the instrumentalists take their turns with a ""lead instrumental break"" between verses.  This is something that can't be pigeon holed into a quartet or quintet.  The genre typically consists of a Bass, Guitar, Fiddle, Mandolin, and Banjo plus 2 to even 4 part harmony vocals.

In Groenigen's film it becomes clear to the casual viewer that there are two prominent themes, and maybe more, but the themes that will transport you as you watch, consist of a love story, and the music.  Bluegrass music for those who aren't among the initiated, tell stories that are deep in the history of culture.  When a film can convey the gravity of how these stories are passed forward, you get a big fireworks show...or in my case tears...tears that flow from listening to the music and the lyrics that tell the tragic tale.

As a reader and writer, I'm a big fan of stories of triumph and tragedy.  I searched my soul for the triumph from the story in this film but could only find solace in the dialog between the characters,  and heart of the music.

When you're ready to cry...a lot, then set aside some time to watch this movie.  I guarantee you'll be touched.",1418947200,5,1605,4.709677419354839

Soooo, I figured at the very least it would be and interesting take on at least one of those angles. Surprisingly, it did wel,l showing me a side of Dutch culture I had not yet seen - a Dutch preoccupation and stunningly good recreation of American bluegrass. I mean these Dutch people got it right in the music delivery department, although I had a hard time imagining them running around, say Haarlem, in cowboy attire and not getting some ""do normal"" Dutch treatment. But, taken at face value, the story is full of interesting presentations of people trying to be what they are ultimately not, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. I'll leave much out of this to spare you spoilers, but the tale has its dark moments when pretend and reality clash and leave the characters questioning everything.

5738887,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"What a powerful film.  If you like really well made movies, this film will keep you riveted from beginning to end. But even though the reviews for this film are mostly outstanding, I was surprised to see how many one star reviews this movie got.  I guess it is not for everybody.  If you are too lazy (or too stupid?) to read subtitles, if you are a prude who is uncomfortable watching love scenes (some people talked of ""graphic sex"" which was NOT in this movie), or are a closed minded religious fanatic, you may not want to see this film. Also, right wing conservatives who assume that because one character in a movie has radical ideas that the whole movie has that theme will not like this.
Other comments just made me wonder.  A lot of people referred to the movie as being Dutch, but it is actually Belgian.  I can see the confusion because the language is so similar. But there were a few people who referred to it as Scandinavian.  I have no idea where that came from.  And again, many references to graphic sex.  There were love scenes and some brief nudity (with no genitalia shown), but it certainly was not graphic.  You want to see graphic, go to BangBros.com.  Then there were the comments about the country music.  It is not country, it is Bluegrass. Believe me, there is a difference.  But that brings up the only criticism I had for this movie.  At one point, they get white outfits to wear on stage that include big cowboy hats.  I am sorry, but Bluegrass musicians never wear cowboy hats.
Everyone who liked this film said that the music was a major reason they liked it.  Yes, the music was very enjoyable, and the light and happy mood Bluegrass presents adds a good contrast to the somber theme of the movie.  But as far as Bluegrass goes, the music in this movie was just fair.  None of the songs in the movie were original, and I have heard better versions of every song they performed.  If you liked the music in this film, you should check out other groups such as Allison Krauss and Union Station, who have recorded some of the songs in the movie.  A good CD would be New Favorite, where they recorded an excellent version of ""The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn"".",1414972800,,2185,4.4175

merited five stars had it not been for the main character's embarrassingly awkward anti-religious
and anti-Jewish rant during a bluegrass performance late in the movie.  The director seemed unaware
of Jewish contributions to medicine throughout history or the fact that stem-cell research in the US was
not shut down.  The touching scene where the mother held their dead child just after dying from cancer
was incredibly moving, as were other parts of the movie.  The anti-religious rant seemed very out of

main character's life.",1412121600,,723,5.110169491525424

It has a strong case of discussion and it was presented from both sides. A very humane and tragic real story.
The pros of the movie are that it  carries a strong idea and discussion, great actors and great blue grass music.
On the other side there are many scenes of frank sex that is embarrassing to watch, you may need to fast forward those. I was not able to advise family and friends to watch it because of that.

The movie is set in Belgium, yet the bluegrass music and atmosphere remind viewers more of rural Tennessee than Flanders. The main character Didier (Johan Heldenbergh, also wrote the script) plays banjo player, whilst  tattoo artist Elise,  joins as a singer.  Her voice reminds us a lot of Alison Krauss.  Their happiness is brutally interrupted when their love-child Maybelle is diagnosed, age 6 with cancer. This turns out to be a real test for  Didier and Elise.  The music appears to be the therapeutic element in the ordeal.  Elements of cinema-verit enter with G. W. Bush's statement  embryonic stem cells research - an important element to safe little Elise.

Broken Circle Breakdown nails painful human truths with a terrifying accuracy that, six months later, still haunt this viewer. The film's rawness makes it all the more wrenching. In my view, *this* is the the artistic statement to which the Academy Awards should have called the public's attention, not the great self-indulgent borefest that took home the Oscar trophy. My sole reservation is a preachy tone toward the end of the film, but it arguably aligns with Didier's anguish. In all other regards, the film is a success.

5738996,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I can't recall the last time I saw a movie so powerful.

I will likely remember this movie most for just how deeply the sadness of its story touched me. But if the sadness was painful, it was only because the happiness was equally palpable. In that respect, it would be a mistake to label this film as ""a sad movie"" or some such. It is a heart-breakingly _real_ movie.

The acting, even from actors in minor supporting roles, is stellar. The music is golden, and seems lovingly and expertly curated. The story is told in the ""non-linear"" fashion that is so often abused; some may still find that displeasing, but here we seem to get just the right piece of the puzzle at just the right moment. How did Didier and Elise meet? We don't find out until much later in the movie, but not before we needed to. Other plot elements are presented in similarly thoughtful manner.

It seems some reviewers have perceived the movie itself as a sort of anti-Bush, anti-right-wing rant, just because there were a couple of scenes where Didier expresses himself in that way. But like at least one other reviewer, I didn't see it that way. As that other reviewer points out, it seems that it's included more as an important character development, sharing with the viewer the disillusionment of Didier for the country that brought him the music he loves, brought about not just by the American political system, but also his own personal experience.

This movie seems to be, among other things, about contrasts. Pain and pleasure. Excitement and boredom. And yes, the inner conflict of being in love, with a country or another person, while at the same time losing respect for the object of that love as a result of differing viewpoints.

Frankly, viewing this movie as a political statement is a waste of time. It's not about politics at all, and treating it as such diminishes the deeply personal narrative that ties your heart into knots, and then tears it wide open.",1406937600,2,1952,4.662790697674419

5739027,3,B00CTMQ7WM,"Warning: may contain some spoilers.

The movie definitely has some positive elements. The music is amazing. The storyline is pretty good (if you don't mind all the flash-back and flash-forward sequences). As others have noted, there are some unrealistic elements (e.g., becoming a professional bluegrass performer after a few lessons). And it definitely has a tragic ending.

However, the main character's complete mental breakdown at the end is so out of character (and so irrational) that I'm guessing all of the 5-star reviews are coming from the NPR crowd who completely agree with his underlying hypothesis about the evils of religion. Forget, for a minute, that embryonic stem cell research really hasn't produced the miracle results promised. And also forget that screaming at your loved ones (much less at entire auditoriums) isn't really the most effective approach for persuasion.

His whole screed against right-wing politicians making decisions based on some arbitrary moral line in the sand is not well thought-out. At some point, a lot of science can be taken to some extreme that violates the moral sensibility of just about everyone, regardless of religious upbringing. If, for example, we truly want to make people bigger, stronger and faster, then we should engage in some sort of eugenics. And if we truly want answers to questions and don't want to be constrained by moral considerations, then we should be big fans of the scientific endeavors of the Nazis. Science is often going to be constrained by moral considerations. Just because people are going to disagree on exactly where that moral line lies doesn't mean one group gets to scream at the other.",1405555200,2,1675,5.150735294117647

5739050,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"This movie deserves every plaudit and more! I was unprepared for such an incredible experience and to my surprise I was utterly captivated and moved by strong performances from extremely talented actors; the casting, acting, storyline and music were sublime.  The story is set in Belgium therefore I was intrigued by the opening scene with the character of Didier singing the title song with his bluegrass band. The story draws you in straight away and weaves and twists with each emotion that the characters feel.

Didier romanticizes about the promise of America and embraces an outward persona e.g. Cowboy hat & boots, big red truck and love of bluegrass.  He lends an amusing contrast to his cowboy image by sipping espresso and falling firmly in the camp of science and atheism. Elise is free-spirited and without strong beliefs but tends towards spirituality.  Despite the overlay of a quirky couple living an alternative lifestyle (Tattoo artist meets liberal, cowboy, bluegrass musician in Belgium), the story peels the characters to their core.

It is the personal beliefs of the couple and how they are expressed that come to bear as the they struggle through unbearable tragedy.

Throughout the film, there is the influence of American music, culture, language and seminal events that resonate with the main protagonist from idealizing America in the beginning to railing against the Bush administration, God and religion as life events cast the couple into despair and suffering.

This is an intelligent, thought provoking and beautifully told story.  I was charmed by the soulful Bluegrass renditions, but more importantly, it reminded me of how fragile life and relationships can be and how we endure through devastating circumstances.  This drama delivers raw, visceral emotions from both characters and as with all great art, draws you in and impacts you in ways you do not expect!

Footnote. The trailer may have been misleading for some and it was not the feel-good light happy movie that others seek for light entertainment. Don't watch this if you are uncomfortable with grief, atheism or Flemish dialogue/reading subtitles.",1404777600,,2144,5.2063953488372094

5739054,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"I started watching this movie mostly because I was intrigued by the fact that a Dutch film has a bluegrass soundtrack. This movie is well acted and has a good story that has emotional depth.  The music is also good.  However, after a certain point, it is almost unrelentingly sad.  I do not recommend that you watch this film when you are feeling depressed.

There are a few nude scenes; I think you can fast-forward through them without losing the thread of the story.  There's also some bad language throughout the film.  Towards the end of the film, the main male character has experienced a recent, deep loss and sees that his marriage is disintegrating; his frustration and anger boil over at a public performance and he starts on an anti-religion tirade.(The focus of his anger is conservative Christians whose political activism has, in his view, retarded scientific progress in fighting diseases.)

The characters, although extreme, are well acted and express the issues that the film is designed to engage.  Yet the film still relies on the most extreme caricature of the Christian paradigm to deny the worldview and the beauty of the very music it features.
It could not resist inserting a self-righteous anti-Christian polemic.  There were existing stem cell lines being researched during the time of the movie and progress was made.  To date, most of the advances have still come from the existing lines. New sources of non-embryonic stem cells have become available.  But the movie intentionally paints a one sided picture, without addressing, in the end, the impact of the protagonist's vilification of any other paradigm than his own.

At first, I was a bit annoyed with the subtitles, but the story sweeps you away and I soon forgot that I was reading while watching.  I won't go into details about the plot since previous reviewers have done well enough with that.  I will say that I'm actually surprised that no one mentioned the 'adult' scenes in which there is full nudity complete with compromising positions - not complaining.  Is this movie sad, yes.  Does it highlight our frailty as human beings, yes.  Do we need to be reminded by a movie that life will kick you in the #@%# and then do it again for good measure, NO! There's a reason why people go watch 'American' movies and it's not because they're shallow or uneducated.  It's because we go to be entertained, plain and simple.  We go to escape the harsh reality of life and not spend days pondering about the meaning of a movie and discuss it with our friends and family.

The lead actors are excellent and I was able to completely lose myself in their characters.  The story line is highly plausible, emotional, and based on actual events.  If you like strong acting and a truthful story line better than special effects, you will love this movie.  The music is also excellent.  Even if bluegrass isn't your favorite style of music, you will most likely enjoy the vocal harmony.  The cultural cross over between Denmark and the US is also insightful to watch.

We can actually have a non-famous cast depict a heart wrenching, this is 'real-life not the movies' type ending and it will be a smashing success. I loved this movie for so many reasons such as the music (which is actually sung by the actors/actress), shooting locals (the house lived in looks like it is lived in, the bar looks dirty yet charming like a  good bar, all without having that *perfect* hollywood veneer that really doesn't exist), the acting, and of course the story. The story is so beautiful, tragic and real. I keep saying real, but I mean it people! I love stories that could actually be true, when things don't always work out, or at least not the way expected, because that's real life.

I'm not usually keen to watch movies that delve into human interest topics like this that don't revolve around military-service but after watching for a few minutes I was intrigued by the excellent music.  The characters eventually grew on me enough for me to actually care about finding out what happened next to them.  My ruff went up a couple of times when they touched on political/religious issues that I feel didn't really enhance the story but after reading another reviewer's take that it demonstrated how someone may grapple with a loved ones death I understand how they might apply.  You can sense impending doom throughout the majority of the movie and those fears are well founded.  The end is crushing and I guess has to be in order to validate the message that life isn't fair and love is hopeless.  Overall, I found the movie impact-full and thought provoking and while it is not something I will ever watch again or readily recommend to friends I think it's a worthy, if ceaselessly dark, foray into the human condition.",1401235200,,1096,4.772486772486772

The Broken Circle Breakdown is a tragic love story that takes place in Belgium, with the characters speaking Flemish and sometimes English. He's a Belgian musician who loves American bluegrass music and sings in a band, and she's a tattoo artist who loves the music, and they meet and fall in love. The story takes on a tragic turn when they have a daughter who becomes seriously ill at around age five or six. The young girl playing the daughter was especially heart-tuggingly good. It was nominated but didn't win the Oscar for best foreign language film, but it did win a bunch of European and other film awards.

5739176,3,B00CTMQ7WM,"Theres one thing great about The Broken Circle Breakdown and that is the excellent bluegrass soundtrack music. Even the haters of the film would admit that. Based on a stage play  but hardly stagy  the Belgian drama is received with loud acclaim, nominated for Oscar (Best Foreign Language Film) and holding an 80 percent positive rating according to the Rottentomatoes site. And I think it is overrated.

It is basically a love story of a musician Didier and a tattoo artist Elise. They fall in love with each other and have a child, but one tragic event awaits the couple. The story itself is nothing new, but told in a different way. Using flashbacks over and over again (a la Blue Valentine), director Felix van Groeningen focuses the raw emotions of the characters  mainly joy and despair  much despair  which in turn attempt to make us emotional, too.

And he is very good at that. There is a sick young girl. Wonderful bluegrass music, too. Who can resist? I read someone saying this is an emotional roller coaster. It is. The film never stops, going back and forth in time, going from one extreme to the other. Let yourself carried away by the flow, and you will enjoy the ride.

But sorry, somehow I found the films emotions overdone, to the point of being false, despite the great music and strong acting. Perhaps I am too much accustomed to old-fashioned storytelling that gives us time to stop, feel and think a while.",1398816000,,1430,4.646825396825397

A sad movie, and beautiful, yet depressing because they couldn't overcome their loss with love, they let it tear them apart.  I probably wouldn't watch it again, but I did order the song ""If I Needed You"" from iTunes and have been listening to it over and over; the music in this film was great.",1398729600,,552,4.382352941176471

Well acted, directed, and the music is quite wonderful but the events that the lead characters face and how they deal with them is not easily watched nor appreciated. In most character driven films, they are the ones driving the story. In this case, they react to them in ways that are immature and self serving with the latter causing their eventual break up.

I felt so connected to the characters and wanted the love Didier portrayed for Elise. My heart broke for them. It's truly an art piece instead of a movie. It does have a pretty strong political/anti religion message at times but if u really watch, you will see how that message changes once the anger of the loss fades into something else.",1398643200,,452,4.329411764705882

If you're a bluegrass fan then you'll love the tunes and the fact that they're delivered in flawless English with believable southern accents.

The floating back and forth in time adds to the layers of drama that this film envelops.  The cinematography truly helps you feel you are a part of Didier and Elise's life; standing behind them as they hold hands, next to them as they play with their sweet daughter, and cry with them as Elise holds Maybelle one last time in the hospital bed.

5739200,3,B00CTMQ7WM,"Beautifully filmed, interesting and heart-wrenching story. Sadly, the film makers injected awkward scenes that project their strong dislike of President Bush which breaks up the rhythm of the film. You're left wondering at times if it is a movie about these characters lives or is it some leftist propaganda movie? I'm no big fan of President Bush, but injecting him into this movie for ridicule just seems out of place. The movie gets rave reviews from the media in the U.S. as it is right in line with their message. I doubt the love would be as strong if the movie took shots at a left leaning President.

Anyway, the film is still worth a look as it is generally well done and has a story to tell. For me though, I like to watch movies to get away from the politics you see on TV. Unfortunately, this is a movie with MSNBC and the New York Times thrown in as well. Leave that out and it is a very good film.",1398124800,7,911,4.296511627906977

Although this looks and feels like somewhere in rural USA, it seems to be set in Belgium and they are apparently speaking Flemish (English subtitles are easy to follow).  But, the husband has an admiration for America which drives much of what he says and does, including perfecting the band's music to a point where it is right there with the best Bluegrass heard anywhere.

It is interesting how all of the speech is subtitled Dutch, but every song is sung in English. Speaking of which, the subtitling does not detract from the film. It is however, a very dark story.

It captures, as closely as anything I've recently watched, the complexity of love in all its splendored variety (i.e., friendship, parenthood, etc).

But the cover is pretty eye catching....imagine my surprise when it turned out to have subtitles complete with toe tapping western music and a few steamy scenes!  It fits the category for an art film...Sundance?  Since I was in by accident, I had not noted that it had a ""made in  Belgium"" credit and studio.  I took the time to review this section after watching.  The characters were well drawn and, even though I am not a cryer, the ending ""brought a 'tear to the eye"" after quite a journey.  This was a bit difficult to watch at times but well worth staying the course.  And if anyone loves tattoo art, you will find this screenplay to be compelling.  The little girl does an exceptional job of winning one's heart, but the deeper themes cannot be ignored.  The folks that wrote and created this movie had a purpose.  Well worth the time it took to watch...and rewatch!  I have already recommended it to several friends.",1397260800,,987,4.545454545454546

5739241,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"I was intrigued by the idea of a Dutch bluegrass band.  I thought I would give this movie 10 or 15 minutes then delete it.  But, I got caught up in it.  I don't speak a word of Dutch, but the english subtitles were not a distraction.  I like bluegrass music although I would not consider myself a fan,  The band sang without noticeable accents.  The heavily tatooed female lead was a bit jolting to look at when she was singing bluegrass, but the singing was a background to the story rather than the focal point.

This movie was a love story about 2 rather unusual people.  The fell in love, got married, and had a child together.  Events beyond their control drove the rest of the movie.  The plot was very believable and poignant.  It was well worth watching.",1397260800,,762,4.371428571428571

There was such an authenticity to it  that it seemed as if I was recalling a treasured story that someone had told me from their own experience.

5739245,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"My wife and I both lost a love one. Her loss was sudden. Mine was to cancer. That's how we met, while in grief recovery. This film captures the emotions of grief quite well. Lot's of spoiler alert to follow.

I found it ironic that he loves blue grass and much of it has gospel undertones. Yet, he directs his anger at the faithful. His rants against religion are pathetic and intentionally depicted that way. His belief in stem cell research as the answer to his loss is way off base, as well. The rants are nothing more than one of the stages of grief.

In the end his wife's spirit is out of body while she lay near death and he gives value to her beliefs by asking her to say hi to Maybelle.  I thought he didn't believe. A clever twist.

He asks her how he can commit to a tattoo as he can't. She says yes she has tats of other men's names which are now covered over by another design. So, they are still there underneath. So, she is saying your love ones are always there, a part of you. Excellent screen play on many levels. I will see it again.",1397174400,,1052,4.117073170731707

I'm going to see if it's available right after I finish writing this review.

5739298,5,B00CTMQ7WM,The Broken Circle Breakdown is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It transports one from the depths and heights of one's emotions. It is a human story of the power of a relationship and how it can be brought down by circumstances outside one's control. It is the story of love. Love that can lead to soaring heights and tragic depths. I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is not a feel good movie however. It is a movie about the truth that occurs in people's lives. Also the music score is second to none.,1396137600,2,514,4.309278350515464

Surprised to find myself looking for the soundtrack. The version of The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn holds its own against other versions; definitely my favorite song in the movie and on the soundtrack.",1396051200,,539,4.56701030927835

The music is so good it seems impossible that the people singing it are not actually from the Great Smokies.  The story line is a bit more complicated than the usual love story fare and
 somewhat heart breaking.  Over all it is a very good movie but pretty intense and probably not everyone's cup of tea.",1395878400,2,429,4.195121951219512

I have never experienced a movie such as this.
Set in Belgium, and I loved how they were madly in love with another. I'm not going to say too much more.
In fact it was an emotional roller coaster for me. or should I say it was as if a 800 pound gorilla picked me up and slammed me against the wall, twirled me around and flung me across the room. Hard hitting. Didn't expect it to be.
At one point I knew I could turn it off, stop watching if I wanted because it was suspenseful...but I could not, I wanted to follow through to the end. Yes I experienced tears of joy and sadness and some parts will rip your heart apart, other times you will smile and laugh with your heart and  I am not into mushy films at all.
A human film.
This movie is also about certain differences. That's all I will say, don't look for it, let the story form, and enjoy the wonderful and intense at times, bluegrass music. The acting and script was superb, such as I haven't seen in such a very very long time from American films.

Courage,frustration,innocence,confusion and tight bonds that whether you know it or not, it will affect you for a lifetime!

5739338,2,B00CTMQ7WM,"This film is a vehicle to bash conservative & Christian religious principles (& Bush-43 - who had been out of office for 4-yrs at the time of the 2012 release of this production).  The last I've heard, virtually all research has shown great promise for ADULT stem cells, and virtually negligible results from EMBRYONIC stem cells - the latter research having continued in non-U.S. countries all throughout the Bush-43 era. Regrettably, in my view, such EMBRYONIC study encourages abortion-ON-DEMAND, which DEVALUES LIFE, and enables societies to allow a civilized Western country (Great Britain) to use aborted & mis-carried remains of babies to fuel hospital furnaces - justified as being more 'green' than conventional fuels; or in this country (U.S.) an abortion doctor's butchery on babies that survived abortions with NONE of his assistants reporting these atrocities for YEARS; or a current world leader telling a woman that her 90+ yr.-old mother's STRONG DESIRE TO LIVE cannot be a factor when the GOVERNMENT determines who will receive an operation or medical procedure and who will be denied. Truly, the choice is between valuing the LIFE OF THE INDIVIDUAL vis-a-vis COLLECTIVISM; again, this same world leader ,in an interview, professed that his Christian faith says that HE cannot be saved unless EVERYONE is saved. This COLLECTIVISM is what allows a centralized government control to DEVALUE the LIFE of Granny, and then surely will extended to many disabled. Those who have heard the vile words of a much vaunted British author, that boast what must be described as the haunting evils of COLLECTIVISM (COMMUNISM)- when ten years prior to its use to exterminate an entire race of people - this author called for the development of a 'humane gas' to eliminate 'without suffering' those in society 'who cannot pull their weight' and therefore are 'useless'. Or those who have seen footage of the unspeakable horrors committed by former Soviet regimes, understand there are crucial lessons to be shared with teenagers, many of whom are being taught that COMMUNISM (COLLECTIVISM) IS GOOD. Lest we forget where my Review started: EMBRYONIC stem-cell extraction. To that issue, I stand by the wisdom formerly shared by perhaps the most highly respected media personality/analyst & author, which says, (as virtually a quote, from memory): THE REASON WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT LIFE BEGINS AT THE INSTANT OF CONCEPTION IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO BASIS UPON WHICH TO DETERMINE THAT LIFE BEGINS AT ANY OTHER MOMENT IN TIME. Amen.  And, lastly, will Hollywood and foreign film makers put forth cinematic criticism & ridicule of SHARIA LAW (Islam/Muslim - non-Christian or Jewish) as this new element continues to insinuate its religious/governmental-ruling brand in American society - a religion that strictly forbids many of the behaviors & practices (to wit, abortion-on-demand) openly embraced by the Left in our country?//  MOST RESPECTFULLY, to those of a differing point of view.  Al Dellamore./END.  // Many hours have passed since submitting my initial review (which I have since edited, as above - but not without guilt [subsequent editing, after submitting, while deleting former editions, is, for me, a form of bailout]). In any event, I have decided to examine the film again - this time, less so through the prism of my RIGHT eye's view. I want to be fair to the film's producers. My STARS-rating was harsh.

However, there is a beauty in observing how the two main characters try to cope with the hand that life has dealt them.  It is the most realistic depiction of the emotions of loss and mourning I have ever seen.  Masterfully done, really.  Is it melodramatic?  Sure it is.  But it is realistically melodramatic.  Without giving anything away, the final duet between Didier and Elise rips my heart out everytime, with the contrasting emotions flying around on stage.  And as far as those claiming the movie is too ""political"", remember the views in the film are the views of the character, a mourning athiest.  He has nothing else to cling to, and the America he has loved to this point becomes an easy target.  This view is not glorified.  Didier is not portrayed as being righteous or even correct.  These views are a major hindrance between he and Elise.  I am a Christian, and when I watched this film, I saw it as an honest depiction of how people without Christ in their lives deal with loss.

The leftist hate towards religion and Bush was a huge negative and distraction. It wasn't needed but seemed to be driven by someone wanting to make a personnel attack, it added nothing to the movie line just one huge pile of poo. I can't imagine an audience just sitting silent and listening to a performer giving a hate religion speech that went on way too long when they paid to listen to music. The ending gives the viewer a punch in the mouth, there is no hope just pain, suffering and then you die when you die. Jesus, how I despise leftist drivel and despair. Two world wars were started in Europe and America spent blood and treasure both times to end them. We don't need to hear from you socialists about stem cell research and rants about Bush. So many evil scum leaders in Europe in history and this movie has it in for George Bush. I hope Putin gives you whack-jobs a visit and demonstrates just what evil is.

It seemed to be wanting to make at least one point about political and religious interference with progress and that point was made.  However, it really had no redemptive value.

5739412,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"This film is beautiful, captivating, and very real. It is not just another film. It is artistic expression at its finest. The chronology of the story deliverance is the best I have seen. It reels as does the memory of one stricken by the effects of love and pain, flowing not from beginning to end by following the clock or calendar, but by following the emotions that drive the memories.

Yes, it is dark, but there is a light. It will tug relentlessly upon the strings of your heart. My usual reaction to such work is to remind myself that it is just a movie. The thing about this one is that it is so BELIEVABLE! The characters are up-close, endearing, and the actors are superb. You can remind yourself that they are actors and your heart will disagree. The music is captivating, amazingly beautiful. It is all traditional American folk and bluegrass, by the way. I was born and raised in Tennessee and I was astounded by the true Appalachian quality of the music. The leading actors are absolutely gorgeous, which along with the music makes it easy to quickly fall in love, which I certainly did. I went into this viewing totally prepared for heartache. I hardened my heart and expected a good dose of the irony and loss that comes with life. Thus, I only cried a little.

What I was left with was the love. There is no pleasure without pain. That's how our brains work. We view everything in contrast to other experiences. With this film we can experience the greatest imaginations of ecstasy in direct contrast to the darkest of our imaginations. If the film was all love and fun it would just be another campy romance flick. Experiencing the full spectrum makes one really appreciate the highs, and there are many. Some are obvious and graphic, others more poetic and subtle. I am left yearning, and is that not the human condition? I am obviously not an articulate art connoisseur, but I know what moves me. I must watch this film again to experience just another one of those moments when everything seems perfect and the source of life and love cannot be traced to either within or without one's self, but it is undeniably present.",1395014400,,2142,4.590078328981723

5739414,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I had heard something about this film prior to seeing the preview, maybe oscar previews or something but this bluegrass classic caught my eye at the preview, and kept them during the feature. These two manage to capture your imagination and heart through their journey and discovery of their love and lust for each other to eventually be replaced by animosity and indifference.

The journey in this film is very unique in the context of the environment and score, while the overall arch is not new, some of the character struggles are. While I have thought about some of the religious and spiritual arguments brought up in the film are not new to me, the direct and lead actor acts these scenes so well, I felt his pain and conviction.

This is emotionally a very tough film to watch, but it is also to be celebrated in a day and age when no one wants to cover topics worth discovery. This is not pop culture, it is the subversive underbelly of beliefs and science and love that most of us don't have the strength to endure.

5739416,3,B00CTMQ7WM,"Ive spoken a lot here (and elsewhere) about how there are few things that touch me deeper than the love of or for a child.  Being a parent, I cant help but feel a very strong connection to stories about that love, whether those stories are told on the printed page, through song or on celluloid.  Its a visceral reaction.  I cant restrain myself.  I just get it.

A few years ago a certain film came out of nowhere and really took me for a loop.  That film was Declaration of War.  Equal parts artistic and stylized and gritty and earnest, that film was about as complete a tail as one could get.  Chronicling the effect that illness has on two parents as they struggle to find answers and reach a happy ending, the film literally (and figuratively) took my breath away.  Thankfully, Valerie Donzelli (who wrote, directed and starred in the film inspired by her own personal experience with her young son) knew how to cut all the realism with a honest humor that made the film not only impactful emotionally but an easy watch.  Despite the obvious sadness that permeated the core themes, the film was such an easy watch.

When I heard a friend liken The Broken Circle Breakdown to the aforementioned masterpiece, I was heavily intrigued.

The Broken Circle Breakdown tells the story of Elise and Didier, two drastically different individuals who fall deeply and dangerously in love.  The film breaks down the timeline of their relationship (portraying it in fractured vignettes) and shows their love sparking, blossoming and then consuming itself in a violent (figurative) climax when their young daughter is diagnosed (and subsequently overtaken) with cancer.  In the wake of this tragedy, their relationship and, more notably, their beliefs are brought to a boil, especially when Didiers staunch atheism begins to corrode their relationship, especially since Elise is firmly religious.

For me The Broken Circle Breakdown presents us with a very intriguing and thought provoking narrative, but its grasp exceeds its reach in many instances, and the finale feels like a cop out of sorts; a lazy attempt to wrap up all the films themes without really coloring anything in.  Being a very religious man, Ive often found solace in the idea of faith, hope and belief.  While staring down any hardship or tragedy, there is a layer of hope that comes from my personal beliefs that help me to get through those moments, those segments in life.  Ive had many conversations with my wife about the beauty of faith in our lives, because I cant imagine the internal torment Id feel if I had none.  What The Broken Circle Breakdown had the opportunity to deliver to us was a balanced look at both sides of the spectrum; the dealing of grief by those with and without faith.  Instead, we get a lot of screaming and crying and blurred lines (or no lines at all) and a finale that feels incredibly forced and dishonest to the conversation that the film seemed like it was attempting to start.

Im all for the dissection of faith, the lack thereof and the impending force that is doubt, but find ways to shade it and not just throw it at the audience and expect us to be moved by it or even begin to understand the point you're trying to make.

I also did not feel that the narrative structure of the film helped at all.  Telling the story in such fragmented pieces was a distraction.  Having a scene of their daughters sickness bleed into the moment they met bleed into Elises pregnancy bleed into their blaming one another for the loss of their daughter bleed into the time Didier proposed bleed into Elise being rushed to the hospital isn't clever, its messy.  Im all for stylistic narratives, but have it serve a purpose.

This just all felt haphazard.

Yes, it hits you emotionally and it does raise some sound arguments (although the Elises religiousness is mostly kept ignorant until the very end, where it feels like an easy way out).  I honestly had to turn the movie off last night because I couldn't emotionally handle it (laying on the couch at near-midnight with my three year old daughter, who is nursing the flu, is not the ideal time to watch a childs casket being lowered into the ground) but after finishing the film this morning it became obvious to me that emotional attachment to the themes was not enough to make this a good film.  I expected more depth out of this film, to be honest, but instead of getting inside Didiers head all we saw was him vent and instead of underlining what exactly it was that Elise believed, all we did was see her cry and so the supposed ideals that this film claims to (or flirts with) exposing are merely left there hanging.

The various elements and layers of the movie are so well blended together that the whole experience is like opening a bottle of essential oils (wine for those with another bouquet in mind)--the first whif smacks you in the center if the face and the layers of aromas slowly reveal themselves to you as you open yourself to experiencing them. The layers in this film are complex, well blended and well aged, promising a deep, instinctual, stirring experience that moves but is hard to describe, that stays with you long after the film is over and is very robust yet sweet.",1394755200,,707,4.488372093023256

The actors are terrific, the sex is steamy, but unless you are ready to watch the ways in which personalities disintegrate when faced with ""a broken circle"", choose another movie.  If we had been forwarned, we would have appreciated this movie much more for the authentic way in whch it depicted human responses to an unthinkable event. The story features a couple who meet and build a relationship that begins with bluegrass music and though the music is an important part of the plot, the real story is about how this couple responds to tragedy and that is not easy to watch.  The flashback technique that is used to reveal different parts of their lives is sometimes confusing but once one sorts this out, the whole thing falls together AND APART.",1394582400,,929,4.6871165644171775

Oh MY, I completely forgot I was ""reading the words"" as this show is so captivating!! The character are so REAL, you are into this movie completely, right from the start!!

5739512,5,B00CTMQ7WM,I really liked this movie.  Ive seen it compared to Blue Valentine but I cant make it thru BV.  It feels in many ways more like Incendiary.  I'm not a fan of Blue grass and usually find sex scenes cringeworthy.  No worries on both accounts here.  The music was always integral to movie and always enjoyable.  Nothing hokey here.  Oscar nom was deserved,1394323200,,352,4.492063492063492
5739513,5,B00CTMQ7WM,I have never reviewed a movie but this one was so touching that I had to give it five stars.

But like no other movie (ever), it left me not only crying but balling as it brought up the question ""why?"". The Broken Circle Breakdown highlights the idea of random tragedy which is inevitably a very human experience. This film then becomes a portal for self reflection and/or catharsis, it was not only master crafted, but very musically pleasing.",1394323200,,429,4.733333333333333

The music is beyond wonderful, the less-than-beautiful central characters are perfectly cast as is the supporting cast, the back and forth storytelling illuminates without causing viewer confusion and this aspect of the film is a directing/editing marvel, and it evokes supremely heightened emotion without the Hollywood-ish tricks of maudlin sentimentality. Even the huge sadness is, in the skillful hands of director Groeningen, somewhat eased by the very last frame.

A soulful love story between two unlikelies, who end up more alike than they planned.  It's a rugged telling, raw and brutal, sweet and endearing.  You can almost smell the wet grass and rain and feel the warmth of the fire and the sun.  I was pulled in to the scenes, as if I was experiencing what the characters were fealing.

I would have given it 5 stars, it is 5 stars for how well done the movie is.  But in the end, I felt the story was somewhat pointless.  Just a reality of a couple with some bad luck and bad outcomes.  Effective in telling that story, but in the end why tell this sad story rather than another?  I can't answer that question.

Some reviewers make a point of the political view expressed by showing George Bush and talking about stem cell research being banned.  I think it was just another piece of reality.  Anyone in the position of these parents would react angrily to any political situation interfering with research to cure their sick child.  I didn't read any more into it than that.

Others try and combine that with a too liberal lifestyle of the main characters.  But again, two young people meet, have a relationship, and get pregnant without planning to do so.  They keep the child, build a home and raise the child.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  The parents are different than normal, especially the tattoo artist mother, but really no evidence of promiscuity.

This is a delicious movie from Belgium, that is refreshingly unusual, showing humans as humans and life as it is. It is not a crusade for ideas like some pretend, and the few sex scenes are not vulgar or shocking in any way like what the hypocritical moral of some traditionalist would like us to believe in their comments. It is a raw movie, with raw people, living, feeling, struggling, and it might not be the most uplifting movie of all times, but if you like to watch a movie to feel and experience different, unusual, non formatted things, and enjoy getting a grasp at the vision of the artist behind the movie (and not just swallow the usual crap meant to appeal to the average american couch potato who has been conditioned his whole life to experience and feel a predetermined and limited number of formatted ideas/feelings) , THEN YOU'RE IN FOR A GREAT TIME. If your favorite movie is Battleship and you hate subtitles... hmm, you'd better pass.

5739568,3,B00CTMQ7WM,"I can appreciate the poetic shots, the unique characters and their powerful, respective performances, but TBCB offers little towards redeeming itself in the end.  Without revealing too much, the storyline has no real arc, but instead employs the 'scattered timeline' device--which has become a tired gimmick--to keep the viewer guessing.  It isn't done tactfully.  Taken A to B, this film plunges into an abyss of despair, a perpetual decline.  The Broken Circle Breakdown gets political in its unraveling then supernatural in its final moments.

Overall however, this was a good film, definitely watchable, with its pacing thrown off by its non-linear delivery; it really could have left the viewer with a more resounding story in its conclusion.

The music, for fans of blue-grass, provided some of the strongest moments in the film.  I guess its role was partly to provide the relief from the chain of melancholy throughout.",1393891200,,927,5.222972972972973

One interesting aspect of the film was the idea of a group of Belgians being so in love with America that they essentially live an american life. The lead actor drives an old dodge truck and the music is sung in a nice american accent. It is a little jarring hearing them go from speaking Dutch and then switching to the Bluegrass in english. The music is great and I plan to get the soundtrack for this. It was really terrific music.

It was so much more (although the music was outstanding). The movie was very well done on so many levels. One where you see layers unfolding before you.

5739621,1,B00CTMQ7WM,"God awful. Very misogynist. Tries to be a slice of life movie, ends up being a male fantasy. Bluegrass is ok.  But let me expand: there is only one female character (the woman in the bikini) who never really interacts with anyone except her husband who flies off the handle with no real consequences to him or his band.  No real virtues except his talent - actually kind of a jerk.  Yes, they suffer through tragedy together, but the ending is tragic because it reveals the filmmakers' reverence for this emotionally immature jerk who doesn't know how to actually consider his wife's well-being.",1393632000,13,595,4.757281553398058

5739627,1,B00CTMQ7WM,"I thought this would be an enjoyable love story even if a bit sad etc. The worldview portrayed is so dark and evil yet portrayed as somehow reasonable and rational. If you think Bluegrass and Folk music are hokey, wait till you check these people out. When I sing the songs in this movie they move me in a totally different way. The anti-Christian, anti-American perpetrators of this ""art"" should be pitied. Their worldview sees the devaluation of life as merciful and avoidance of suffering as the measure of morality. But I know the God they hate so badly loves them more. Until their last breath he will be seeking them and imploring them to look for real love. There is a joy in every journey.

This Belgian film, not Dutch, is haunting and mesmerizing the same way an executioner's slowly descending blade appears to a non-blindfolded victim.  I sat frozen like a fly caught in a spider's web to the very last credit line....and then erupted into sobs.  The ability to evoke a strong emotional response does not alone make a good film.  This film needed more balance, more character development to offset the agonies being suffered.  But yes, the acting was amazing. I would like to see the main actors in other work. As an American who has not as yet been to Belgium, I would have enjoyed seeing more of the countryside reminiscent of Flemish landscapes...unless that's all gone.  The film lacked locale identification which I believe is an important character in a film such as this and would have lent credence to the background and beliefs of the main actors that were being challenged by the film's subject.

Why only one star?

 Because I detest the depiction of how we humans are so insensitive and ignorant toward animals. Seconds into the film, the woman is chasing down frightened chickens in order to amuse herself. She should have a giant 20 times her size chase her down. I immediately disliked her character and did not care about her fate as much as I would have otherwise. I know someone else wrote it and directed it, but she had the choice to go along with the script or not.

Then, the idiot man builds a glass ""terranda"" outside of their house. Of course birds fly into it and kill themselves. Rather than take responsibility for his creation of the horror, his response is to rave on about how they are ""idiots"" for not understanding it.

The bluegrass soundtrack is amazing and flows so amazingly with the movie, just wow!  The voices of the actors are fabulous, you'd have no idea they're not American.

The actors do a great job in their parts.  In the time of the movie, you feel like you know these people.  Not just the main characters but even the supporting casts.

The story isn't lovely or sweet but it is very real.  It's nice to get past all of the flowery, unrealistic movies.  I want movies where I think about them for days after watching them.

Life has no meaning... very much Anti US/ antI President Bush, and certainly anti Christian!.

The actors are known extreem liberals in Belgium. The country of origin of the movie.
They also added they hope the movie will spread in the USA and that people would watch it in the hope to bring much needed ""CHANGE"" to the US.

Unless you like to see the bearded guy walking full nude in his yard, and like Flemish style SAVAGE sex, you could skip straight to the scenes the movie is all about.

At 1h13min. and at 1h27min. into the movie, I wrote literally what he (the bearded guy) was ranting, it's so anti christian, anti american!!!  His language (of the bearded guy) is so vulgar that Amazon did not even post the review and suggest to re-write it.

This movie should be BANNED, and we would be very disappointed if this anti american movie would win an oscar!

Unfortunately, I can't post my review in it's original form... so you would have to go listen for yourselves if this is acceptable what he rants in the movie.

THE CHANGE THEY HOPE TO BRING TO THE USA IS THE OPEN DEBATE OF CHILD EUTHANASIA/THE RIGHT TO DIE/ABORTION/AND THE ABOLISHMENT OF THE CHRISTIANS. As stated on the belgian tv!

I rarely watch movies with subtitles, because it seems that the dialog is usually too much to keep up with that the subtitles are more work than desired to make it worth your time. This foreign subtitled film IS WORTH YOUR TIME.....Dialog is minimal therefore it worth your time to read the subtitles; not too much work. ;)

It has at least 3 intense sexual scenes, which I am not comfortable with, and I am not entirely sure adds to the movie, so I was glad
I was at home to fast forward and didn't have to be uncomfortable in a theater. The attraction and passion for the each other and the Arts is clearly evident already.

Not a B movie by any sense of the label. A wonderfully filmed, casted and scored independent film by all rights.

P.S.
I am a Christ follower and did pick up on the clearly Atheistic tone and message. Many other reviewers had not liked the film simply for this reason. I was NOT one of them. I am giving credit where credit is due, on behalf of the art of filmmaking. I had compassion on the characters and it actually increased my desire to spread the Gospel more in my personal life.

I don't want to reveal anymore, but I will say that Baetens and Hedenbergh  projected an image that was, in my opinion, about as natural as is humanly possible in film land. There was not a second that seemed artificial. The fact that I had never seen these actors before probably helped to make it more believable, but it was much more than that for me.

5739712,2,B00CTMQ7WM,"The first half of the film was very good.  It was emotional, heartfelt, and tender.  After all, there's nothing more tragic and sad than a sick child.  One thing I found strange during the first half was the inclusion of the end of President Bush's speech to the nation on the night of 9/11/01.  The family was watching TV during a flashback scene on 9/11.  It was apparent later on in the movie that the inclusion of President Bush was intentional and a set up for later on in the movie.

After the death of Maybelle, the couple struggles emotionally, as is expected and understandable.  It's at this point that the film takes a major turn and becomes a vehicle by which to attack God, Catholicism, and anyone to the right of the typical far-left, neo-liberal.  The pivotal scene is Didier's tirade, on-stage, assailing God and ridiculing anyone who has faith in a loving, heavenly Father.  It was reminiscent of Al Pacino's rambling tirade against God in ""The Devil's Advocate"".  In fact, while watching Didier on stage, I thought that these are exactly the arguments that Satan would use to turn people away from faith.  He does cite the Old Testament, but Jesus came and established a New Covenant.  He came to show us, and tell us, that God is loving, caring and kind.  He doesn't punish us, we condemn ourselves.

The anti-Catholic bigotry and rhetoric is subtly disseminated in the first half of the film.  The doctor's reference to treating Maybelle's cancer with stem cells could be more effective if only they were at the point where the could clone embryos.  Can you imagine?  ""Progress"" is farming babies for spare parts, then disposing of them as trash.  The science has shown that adult stem cell treatment is actually far more effective, and not destructive to life.

Later in the film, Didier actually refers to the Pope as ""that scumbag, Pope"".  Ah, tolerance!  Liberals love to preach that word, especially when it comes to religion.  Only in their universe is it acceptable to refer to a religious leader as a scumbag, and not be accused of hate speech.  And why exactly did Didier feel it necessary to refer to the Pope as a ""scumbag""?  Because of the church's teaching on contraception, that it shouldn't be used so as to not use another human being solely for sexual pleasure and selfish purposes.  Note:  the church doesn't force anyone to do anything.  Everyone has to follow their free will, just as God allows us to do....and in the end, people do follow their free will.

This film started so well, but it was a ploy to get your sympathy and make you susceptible to the anti-God rhetoric later on.",1393113600,12,2624,4.682713347921226
5739713,3,B00CTMQ7WM,"The Broken Circle Breakdown  is without doubt a well-made movie, with a good storyline, great acting, and incomparable music.
But it is still a propaganda film.  Assisted suicide in certainly one of its causes.  It is an anti-George W. Bush movie also that pulls no punches in its negative depiction of the Catholic Church and its dogma on contraception.  It is dated, in that for purposes of creating emotional appeal in its audience the movie has the main character with anger and emotion strike out at the moral beliefs of pro-life Americans regarding stem cell research.
It uses crucifixes and children as mere props at times time mellow the real intent of the message.
It was good to see a movie about country (bluegrass) music that has pickups trucks, cows, cowboy hats where the thing beaten up on physically are walls and other inanimate objects.  I did not for a moment miss bar fights and parking lot brawls, although I was expecting them.  Perhaps it is the influence of the Belgium contributions that account for this just as it must account for the assisted suicide propaganda.
All of this anger in this movie is really such a shame.  I guess I should be grateful that the tendency toward hurting a person for these characters is all self-directed where it seems the female lead attempts suicide by pills over the loss to cancer, several times until the last attempt results in brain damage and the reason for her assisted killing in her hospital bed as the bluegrass band plays music at her bedside.
It is a well-made film meant to appear complex and meaningful.  How complex is it that abortion is ok, assisted suicide (medical murder in a hospital under a doctors care) is ok but that a child or two die of cancer that could have been undoubtedly been saved except that George W. Bush vetoed some legislation and religious minded Christians in the United States block medical research that is a morally questionable use of stem cells.
I find the complexity only in the level of effort made to manipulate and appeal to the emotions and feeling of any audience.

Subtitles don't bother me.  I didn't find them a pain or to interfere with the movie experience at all.  If anything, it enhanced it; hearing grief expressed in a different language lends a different feel to it all, but at its core, the pain is the same no matter what language is being spoken.

The acting in this movie is superb.  The storyline is both wonderful and heart-wrenching at the same time.  This movie reminded me of the lyrics to Garth Brooks' song ""The Dance"" because it brought up an interesting question: would you go through it all again if you knew what pain it would bring in the end?

A few reviewers have fixated on the anti-religious vibe of some of the scenes, but I didn't seem to take it that personally, and that's coming from someone who usually votes republican. The bluegrass singer LOVES America; he states it very emphatically in the beginning of the film.  He loves bluegrass and sings the songs in English.  I think the ""rants"" that the bluegrass singer delivers has origins in his grief.  His daughter needed a treatment that wasn't perfected yet in his country, yet he sees President Bush rejecting it on moral grounds alone.  No matter what your political or religious stance is, if you lost a child that needed a certain treatment, chances are you would highly resent anyone standing in the way of that treatment.  This is not a political statement -- not at all.  Even though I've never lost a child, I could identify with Didier's grief and anger after he saw Pres. Bush give that speech.  Didier was not terribly religious, so of course he'd be outraged that treatment his daughter was relying on was being rejected on moral/religious grounds.  Who wouldn't feel this way?

This movie captures these parents' grief in a very real way.  I think most parents wonder how they'd handle the grief if something like this ever happened to them.  I know I have.  I don't know if I'd be strong enough to put my life back together again, so I as a viewer totally identified with Elise's plight of desperately trying to find solid ground again.  What is ""normal"" after your entire world gets ripped apart anyway?

5739735,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I watched this film last night and I keep reflecting back on it. Only the most beautiful works of art are capable of doing that.

+++Spolier Alert+++
This is not a straight forward film and neither is the dialogue. It would seem like this were a film about a tragic love story where a relationship is tested by the death of their daughter, Maybelle, and the couple deals with the outcomes of that tragedy. But this film does not feature the emotionally mature characters that rise to the challenge and overcome the overwhelming grief. Instead we have two grown children who must struggle with this predicament.

Unfortunately, they blame each other and themselves and even attempt to paint over their emotions by re-purposing Maybelle's room. All of which leads them further down the path of making horrible decisions.

The scenes in the film where Didier blames the Bush administration is, IMO, less about stem cell research and religious idiocy and more about finding an acceptable reason for why his daughter didn't survive which led to the demise of his happiness. I think the film benefits from his on-stage rant although it comes as a non-sequitur in the film. Where I think it works is that he is taking advantage of the only platform he has, the music stage, even though we can obviously see the meltdown in process, he cannot see it so clearly.

Elise on the other hand deals with problems by tattooing over them but is forced to recognize that this was never an effective scheme to bury her feelings. When she loses that false crutch she loses her will to live and grasps at terrible solutions to fix her problems.

The beautiful backdrop to this film is the music, which is outstanding, and the cast of characters that make up the band. They provide a majestic sound and some comic relief to the story. Thankfully there are some bright moments that lift this story just high enough to keep you from becoming emotionally fatigued. A truly 5 Star film.",1392854400,9,1961,4.722222222222222
5739736,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"I love the European films. They always show the dark side of the moon without fireworks or excess of melodrama. Two misfists according their patterns behavior, fall in love. Lovers of the music country; until this point everyting seems to be on wheels, until and unexpected fact will change their lives. And the inability to face the tragedy plus the inner demons of every one of them will take them away to an existential disaster.

A very honest artistic proposal. The excessive employment of flash backs is part of the tension too.

5739744,4,B00CTMQ7WM,"You'd never expect a movie centered around bluegrass music to be Dutch but this one is.  It doesn't really matter, though, because the story is a universal one.  Two people meet, fall in love and set out on a life together.  What follows is at times beautiful and magical and at other times, heart breaking and unfair.  It's a very realistic portrayal of the challenge of having a relationship and a family.  Surrounding every turning point in the story is the sweet and haunting sound of old time bluegrass standards like Wayfaring Stranger, Will the Circle be Unbroken and Over in the Glory Land.  I grew up listening to these songs and have never heard them performed any better than they are done for this film.  The only reason I didn't give this the full five stars is that I felt it got bogged down by some political mumbo jumbo towards the end.  That doesn't last long, though.  Overall, this is a heartfelt and deeply personal story about the love between a man and a woman.  It's definitely worth the extra time that the subtitles take.

5739747,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"This movie really got my attention, and I know I will be thinking about it for a while. I rarely write reviews but felt rather compelled to for some reason.  It was filmed in Belgium, so it has subtitles (just an FYI because some people really don't like that). The story is also told in a nonlinear style...which I know some don't like. The film is about two people who fall head over heals in love and lust, have a child and lose her to cancer when she is 7 years old....One of the most devastating experiences I think a person can endure. How will they cope? Will this couple find a way to endure and their bond (which is markedly strong and real) remain intact, or will their mutual loss render it impossible? There are aspects of religion and politics, and bigger questions of one's true perspective on matters of faith,existence, what is real and identity. But (with few exceptions) these things are dealt with rather subtlety, or through allusion.  In other words, this film, including its dialogue, is not ""flashy"".

One of the things I enjoy about most foreign films is their lack of ""flash"", and this is true of The Broken Circle Breakdown. Elise and Dierde (sp?) are  extremely unique and likeable characters. I read another review mentioning the physical ""perfection"" of the characters so common in American films.  Perfection is so boring.  People's imperfections are part of who they are, and are (interestingly) often the very thing that makes them beautiful.  The acting is amazing as there is an authenticity to these characters that is not often achieved....Not just in their appearance, but in their actions and interactions. Their daughter, Maybell (after Maybell Carter lol), is an absolute doll, and her character was very well played too.

I must admit to being a bit leery when I read that this movie included a Bluegrass band in Belgium.  Surprisingly, I have to admit that I haven't heard Bluegrass music better performed in the U.S., and I am a southern woman who grew up listening to just such music. As an aside, I was surprised by his knowledge of some of the history and significance of this genre (even if a few of his ""facts"" were incorrect). It never occurred to me that a foreigner would really care or understand.  But what I think is significant about the inclusion of the music is how it is incorporated to add and/or clarify aspects and/or emotions of the story not present in dialogue or otherwise. Masterful device.

Bottom line: Although it's a tear jerker, I highly recommend this film to most anyone interested in a story about what is real, and how joyful, unpredictable and devastating life can be.  If you're looking for car chases, bombs and people who wake up with perfectly coiffed hair (not putting you down; sometimes that's what I'm in the mood for), this will not be your cup of tea.",1392508800,,2837,4.709090909090909

5739755,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I don't think Hollywood could produce a love story more elegant, more real, more imaginative, full of raw power than this film. I attempted to see when it premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, but I couldn't get tickets, and after seeing it I understand why. The acting is spot on; the direction was flawless; and the screenplay! Many may think this film somewhat disjointed because it jerks back and forth from past to present, but it actually intensifies the journey we take with these people; and I think that is the basis of all excellent films; the film should take us on a journey; from beginning, to middle, and to the end. This film more than meets that requirement, using past and present scenes to lead the viewer along wondering; ""Okay, how did they get to that point?"" and by the time you arrive at the climax, all your questions are answered. This to me heigthens the experience because then you cannot take your eyes off the screen; and is that not the goal of every film maker?

After losing two loved ones over the years, I think the film is an extraordinary and dymamic depiction of the devastating effects of grief. It shows the misunderstandings, the vulnerabilties, the careless remarks, the wrong conclusions, the idols ""broken down"", and ultimately how grief can destroy even the most passionate of relationships. For example, Dieter's atheistic rage was less about God and more about the emotions of a man whose heart was broken; losing a daughter he was at first ambivalent about having, but then loving her more than life itself; and over the fractured relationship with his wife who shared his life's passion.

I don't know if it'll win the Oscar for best foreign film; I hope so, but if it doesn't, it deserves every acolade it has received, and it'll go down as a testament that reveals the often hard reality that sometimes our love and passion is not enough.",1392249600,9,1890,4.706948640483383

The second time, it was more because I wanted to hear the music again.

Apart from the music, the story works because of the two leads who are absolutely brilliant in their roles as Didier, a Belgian bluegrass musician in love with the idea of America, and Elise, a beautiful--and beautifully tattooed--tattoo artist and free spirit.  They meet, fall in love, and Elise becomes the lead singer in Didier's bluegrass band.  Once she's added to the band, they grow in popularity becoming quite successful.  They have a child and then a tragedy begins to tear their lives apart.

What I appreciated about the film: 1. Unlike Hollywood, the actors look like real people, teeth and all.  I enjoy watching a film where the people don't look manufactured to perfection, where they look authentic.  2. The simple story delivers an unexpected double whammy & reminds us that our lives can change completely in an instant through no fault of our own. 3. The music is indeed divine and organically handled.

In addition, I particularly enjoyed the tongue-lashing Didier unloads on George Bush.  Some critics have panned that part of the film, observing that it detracts from the story.  I think it pays off Didier's disillusionment in America, a place he starts off romanticizing about as a country of dreamers, then ends despising as cruel and barbaric.  It reflects the reality he's forced to confront in his life at the end of the film.",1391904000,99,1778,4.8250825082508255
8586122,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"I have watched this movie several times, I bought the digital version and the sound track... I love the music some of the best Blue Grass you will ever hear, which in its self is a great surprise and makes the movie worth watching.

It is a tragic story, one that touches me very personally; from November 2015 till 2018 I have lost most of my family and friends to cancer, suicide or accidents... so even with subtitles it is one of the most moving movies I have ever watched.

It is among the top 20 or 30 movies I have watched/experienced in my 65 plus year life. Not a family film unless you are ready to introduce the harshest realities of life to your children. Still I would say a must watch.",1530057600,,699,4.2481203007518795
8586123,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"What a movie!  You have to watch it closely as the timeline moves from past to present and back, and it is subtitled.  It is well worth watching, though not with children.  The music is great!  I am amazed that it didn't win best foreign language film, but it was nominated.  It did win other awards outside of the U.S.  This film is a tragic love story, but I liked it enough to watch it twice.",1520208000,,395,4.131578947368421

8586125,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"The Broken Circle Breakdown is an honest and superb portrayal of reality. We normally do not offer movie reviews, but a few previous ~ some shallow, some flippant ~ prompt this exception.

The Author/Writers have assembled uncanny insights into how humanity deals with purpose, uncertainty, hardship, grief, political/religious influence, and mortality during existence within eternity. The Director has captured those insights. He uses flashbacks to ease his audience into how the two principal characters get from where they were in life to where they are. He does not pad length with physical travel. Performances by the principal Actors are stellar. This movie has authentic Bluegrass and clever humor:  It could be a foal. We missed several subtle allegories during our first viewing, i.e.: cattle standing in the muck around their life-source. Viewing only once would probably deprive the viewer of much clarity and depth.

Broken Circle is among the top 10 in our collection of over 250 titles.",1513555200,,1001,5.322784810126582
8586126,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"Wow! I can not begin to describe much I love this movie. It has made my top 5.  I choose it based on the description thinking it was a love story with bluegrass music but I got so much more than that.  I had to pause several times just to catch my breath and stop crying.  As a mother who has watched my child battle cancer I was heartbroken for the couple....I didn't want to finish the movie but I'm glad I did.  Amazing acting by everyone, I can honestly say I have never seen better.  The love and pain seemed so real. I will be adding this movie to my collection.",1513382400,,568,4.035714285714286

8586129,5,B00CTMQ7WM,"A Belgian bluegrass film? Dispel all doubts: This cinematic firebomb follows a bluegrass musician and a tattoo artist who fall madly in love, face the loss of their child, and then fall apart. Its a straight-over-the-edge romance, as passionate about music as love, and desperately tragic, the type that only comes along once in a generation (e.g., Betty Blue from 1986 or Head-On from 2004).  At the heart of the film, surprisingly, lies an argument between a secular, atheistic view of the world and a spiritual, mystical outlook; without saying either is right or wrong,  it shows how other unknowables, things like music and love, are stronger, and ultimately more sustaining.",1509408000,,680,5.117117117117117
