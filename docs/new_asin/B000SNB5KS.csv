8206106,5,B000SNB5KS,"Donna Hugh, the demonstrator on this video, has such a reassuring way with children.  She speaks to the artist inside every child, she celebrates happy accidents, and she makes her explanations clear.

This video offers four different watercolor projects.  You will need paper, a medium-size round paintbrush for each child, black crayons, and black felt-tip markers (like Paper-Mate).

The first lesson is a flower garden -- children paint blobs and background, let them dry, then outline flower shapes.  Information about hot colors/cool colors.
The second lesson is a discovery lesson -- the children paint blobs, and then after the paper dries, they outline shapes that they can see within the painting.  Anything goes.
The third lesson is a desert scene -- there is information about desert landscapes and analagous colors on the color wheel.  Very interesting, good results from this lesson.
The fourth lesson is opaque watercolors, using a very thick painting technique to make a fish.  It almost looks like stained glass.",1327363200,4,1029,5.269938650306749
8206107,5,B000SNB5KS,"I really enjoyed viewing this DVD and will be using some of the ideas presented in it with my grandchildren.  Sometimes it is hard to know where to start when working with young people.  The concepts presented in this DVD allow the use of color in a manner that is not overpowering.  While some of the ideas might seem simple enough, they enable a person to come away from the experience with a feeling of success and not failure.  I think it is a great DVD.  So far, I have been well pleased with the ones in this series that I have purchased.  Teachers as well as parents wanting to present art to their young ones will gain a lot from this DVD.  I would highly recommend it.",1268524800,,677,4.2421875
8206108,5,B000SNB5KS,"I LOVE Donna Hugh.  I wish she had been my art teacher in elementary school.  In this video, Donna goes through 4 art projects.  She paints as she talks to the camera, and she is just very calm and reassuring.  Especially great is the fact that she has anticipated perfectionist children's fears, so when she goes outside her outlined picture or makes another mistake, she matter-of-factly tells us that it's o.k., and incorporates the mistake into the picture.  I guess it's good for perfectionist parents, too, because I have found this accepting attitude really speak to me!  This video is great for homeschool and school settings.  I highly recommend it!",1251417600,4,658,4.927272727272728

8206110,5,B000SNB5KS,"This video series offers practical, step-by-step instructions for children who wish to learn to paint with watercolors. The instructor demonstrates a sound knowledge of children's abilities and needs. Students can produce frame worthy works in  very little time, and will thoroughly enjoy the show.",1210291200,,298,5.7727272727272725
