7826909,5,6302507227,"If you are looking to see a bunch of cute LA girls in a far-fetched plot where Ray Sharkey chases down Zach Galligan and Corey Feldman, who don't know they have stolen money stashed in the car they ""borrowed"" for the weekend to go watch a model search contest in Palm Springs, you will like this movie. Fun, entertaining, fast-paced, and plenty of LA humor.  Best for viewers over age 16, as some nudity and adult (sexual) language.",1245888000,,432,4.538461538461538
