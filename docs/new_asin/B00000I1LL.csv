1218444,1,B00000I1LL,"a total sell out by Wes Craven by attaching his name to this unspeakably inept remake of one of the great cult classics of all time.  This is as awful as Herk Herverys origianl is brilliant.  Where as the original was  creative, creepy and almost surreal, this one has an ""artistry""  that would shame Ed Wood let alone Wes Craven.  It has the feel of a tacky  tv straight to vid film which it undoubtedly was.  The acting is worse than  amateurish, the plot - a total shamble.  There is not a shred of suspense  or tension throughout the movie......and one only yearns for one thing,  that it be over SOON.  The best thing about the movie is its relatively  short running time at less than 90 minutes.  After the putrid  Wishmaster.....now this over-ripe turnip.  What can we expect from the  ""Wes Craven presents"" next time around? new depths in the modern  horror cycle.  This is a true stinker.......stay well away and save up your  pennies for the mouthwatering upcoming Criterion release of the original  and marvelous CARNIVAL OF SOULS.  due in March 2000 with any luck.",947462400,5,1076,4.641711229946524

I particularly enjoyed Shawnee Smiths performance, I have been a big fan of her since the Saw series. She was great in this, and so was most of the other cast.

1218458,5,B00000I1LL,"This remake of the 1962 cult classic directed by Herk Harvey, ""Carnival of Souls,"" produced by horror film maven Wes Craven, may be updated to fit the times, but stays true to the basic plot line, and has lost none of its eerie, intriguing appeal. I wanted to see this remake because of having really been drawn to the original 1962 version. Bobbie Phillips and Larry Miller in the lead roles are especially effective.

1218459,2,B00000I1LL,"To find out what the plot is about, read other reviews.  Or better yet, watch the 1962 cult classic instead of this.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...

In 1998 Wes Craven decided he wanted to remake the Herk Harvey 1962 B horror movie cult classic ""Carnival of Souls"".  He remade it, alright.  He made it so different from the original, yet so familiar.  It has a very similar plot, but it's just so '90s-ish.  It's not dark, spooky, and subtle like the original is.  The original is one of the best psychological horror films of all time.  In contrast, this remake is more bizarre, more graphic, and more sinister than the original.  It's just a typical modern day horror movie.  It's very confusing as well.  It seems like every few minutes a scene will play out and end up being a dream.  This happens many times throughout the movie.  This movie is really an insult to the original.  This movie's carnival isn't anything like the Saltair Pavillion.  The Saltair Pavillion was abandoned and eerie.  The carnival in this remake, in contrast, is operating and full of patrons.  The clown can't compare to the ghoul in the original.  You want eerie music?  Watch the original.  In my opinion, the original is a movie that can't be remade.  It just can't.  It just can't be made better.  It's like The Wizard of Oz - don't anybody ever dare to remake that movie.

If you approach this movie with an unbiased open mind and take it at face value when watching it, you might like it.  I think it would help if the viewer has never seen the original.  If this is the case, the viewer probably will rate this movie higher than he/she would if they've seen the original first.  Myself, I think this is a 2 star movie when I take it at face value.  I would still rate it at 2 stars if I had never seen the original.",1330041600,,1823,4.374251497005988
1218460,4,B00000I1LL,"I don't think a lot of people -got- this movie. It's a pretty straightforward remake of Herk Harvey's 1962 classic. Is this movie itself a classic? No. But is it worth watching if you've seen the original movie? Oh, absolutely!

Superficially speaking the original and the remake seem like completely different films-- one might say that the remake in no way resembles the original but I don't think that's true at all. While the remake here starts off completely differently, it adds a new depth to the female lead character, unfortunately this gives the entire movie the feel of being a ""Jacob's Ladder"" ripoff. But that's okay, because the original ""Carnival of Souls"" was sort of one of the main inspirations for ""Jacob's Ladder."" Anyway, how are the original and the remake of ""Carnival of Souls"" similar? I'll tell you, but I'm warning you now, this review contains spoilers...

Both movies feature a psychologically damaged woman on the run from a sinister force that seems to be cultivated at an abandoned fairground and are primarily antagonized by one the ghastly apparition of a haunting male individual. They both feature a psychiatrist character who is trying to help the young woman who has a quasi-love interest in a secondary character and in the end it turns out the movie is taking place in a strange purgatorial realm between life and death, maybe one leaking into the other, which one is ultimately left up to the viewer.

Cleavant Derricks takes on the role of Herk Harvey's character from the original, this time being portrayed as a sadistic clown who abused the main character as a little girl ultimately culminating with his arrest and conviction after murdering her mother in cold blood. Years later the little girl has grown up and is running a bar/inn near the old fairgrounds where it happened with her little sister. After a bizarre incident at the beginning of the movie, she starts seeing horrifying images all around her, fleshy skulls staring at her through her car window or in the water of her sink when washing her face and she begins to question her sanity. The differences between this and the original are nominal for the thirty six year gap between them, but considering this was made for the Sci-Fi Channel, I think it's pretty good! And if you watch this and the original back to back, it'll make a whole lot more sense because there are more similarities than meet the eye.

I liked it, but it's not for everyone. It was fun to see old Sidney Berger from the original movie in a cameo at the end where he speaks a line of dialogue similar to one his own character from the old movie said many years before. I really thought he was a good actor despite his filmography consisting only of ""Carnival of Souls"" in 1962 and ""Carnival of Souls"" again in 1998! Why he never took up more acting is beyond me. But I digress. For the Amazon Instant Video price of eight bucks, this is more than worth adding to your video library if you're a fan of the original.

If you're able to look beyond the ridiculously low budget appearance and superficial changes to the original you'll find this to be a fun, if not heavy hearted remake of a far simpler film.",1285372800,,3187,4.6637010676156585
1218461,4,B00000I1LL,"This movie is a very good remake of a classic. Theme remains the same, young attractive woman having an in and out experience with reality.

1218462,5,B00000I1LL,"The 1998 version of the 1962 low-budget horror classic.

It was a bad idea to classify this as a ""horror"" story, even though some of the events do qualify as horror. But too many people try to match this to the original, and that in itself is a mistake. In the day where original films are passe, at least this tries to make a new story based on a similar premise. That being a young woman is made to face her fear.

The Phillips character (Alex), as a young naive girl, witnesses the rape and murder of her mother, and could have shot this fiend (Louis, portrayed by Larry Miller) before he killed her; he foolishly left his gun on the nightstand. Watching the mother character's neck snap in the hands of Louis, is singularly unpleasant to watch, and downright disturbing. Instead, she panics and runs. He was obviously caught, and served twenty years for his offense, and now he's out to even the score (""I never hold a grudge, once I get even"").

It's about sacrifice, facing the thing that scares you the most, and letting your worries go. Many times in the film, the Sandra character (Shawnee Smith) tells her big sister not to worry about her, ""You worry too much, I'll be fine."" Alex sees herself as the reason the girls were orphaned so early, and denied the relationship with their mother; she could have shot Louis before he killed her mother (the father was absent all along, pretty typical in too many families) and fretted over Sandra as if she were her own daughter. In an act of closure, on the twentieth anniversary of the murder, Alex goes to the seaside to let the wind blow the ashes of her dead mother over the ocean, and when she returns to the car, there's a balloon on her car's windshield wiper. Louis has obviously been stalking her, and at gunpoint, he decides it's time to finish old business. You are forced to drive to your home and watch this monster at work again. So what do you do? With a murderer's gun to your ear, you floor your gas pedal, steer your car off the pier, and even though you die yourself, you rid the world of this filth who has ruined at least three lives.

The entire middle of the film (from the bathtub scene until the second time the car plunges into the water) is a personal journey through life in an alternate dimension. Her aquaintences are all there, with their own lives, but everything they say and do, is geared to her dilemma. She's dead, and refuses to face it. She is afraid to leave her sister behind, and afraid of the man who has tormented her for twenty years, and afraid to move to the next. The ""beings,"" I'll call them, are symbolic of crucial times , people and events in her world, and they are called ""annoying"" by some people, but they are symbolic of personal demons in her life; they pop up at crucial moments. Startling to look at, because they come in so unexpectedly, they are meant to catch you off guard, as they do Alex.

The events are about closure, and moving on, and in one flashback scene toward the end, the old man in the bar asks her, ""You're not afraid, are you?"" And again, Sandra says ""You worry too much; I'll be fine.""

Again, it's not necessarily horror per se, though some horror elements are present.

It's a movie about life, that's all.",1152835200,2,3240,4.426174496644295
1218463,2,B00000I1LL,"A young girl sees her mother violently killed at the hands of the live-in boyfriend (who also happens to be a carnival clown).  Later as an adult she is haunted by her past when the carnival comes back to town.

I loved the original black and white Carnival of Souls movie and I'm usually a little skittish about remakes.  I must admit that I was given some forewarning that Wes Craven changed the plot in this one, which probably helped my overall take on it.  So from the start I wasn't expecting much.

In this version the girl and her sister own a bar.  There is no church and no organ music, which takes away from the eeriness that we all loved.  Hmm how to describe?  In another review someone described the original b&w movie as being ""darkly poetic and haunting,"" which can't be said any better.  In this version, Wes Craven turns the carnival into a brighter, more chaotic and psychotic place.  The ending is similar in the sense that everything is not what it seemed, but obviously with the different plot comes an entirely new scene.

Shawnee Smith is in this film, which is a definite bonus.  Also Larry Miller plays a great sicko clown!

I'm giving the movie a 2.5.  Compared to the original, the movie deserves a 1 or less.  However, anyone who enjoys Wes Craven flicks and sees this movie  before seeing the original will probably enjoy it enough to rate it a 3 or 4.  So I'll be generous and rate in the middle.",1152403200,5,1427,4.426923076923077

 Some people just can't deal with stress very well. A young lady is transported into the shadowy recesses of her own darkside, cued by the infernal instrument of the organ. Her life becomes haunted by her fears & nightmares, as they slither into reality.

 The camera angles are very creativly utilized, & the sense of eeriness is preserved well throughout the movie. I thought it a great touch to present the movie mostly non-verbal but for a couple of occasions, in order to present realistic dream sequences. Mental torment & fantasy / reality crossover rampant here, without the demoralization.  Very well recommended.",1106092800,,719,5.059322033898305

Yes, I know Alien had the cool Gieger designed creature, and  Hellraiser had the guy with no skin and Pinhead, but it was really the mood  they put you in. In much the same way, Carnival of Souls works. If you  aren't patient, don't watch this movie. If you can't handle an ambiguous  ending, definitly don't watch this movie.

I truly  enjoyed the psychological aspects to this movie.  I completely understood  and felt the sadness,confusion,and finally acceptance Alex Grant(Bobbie  Phillips)went through.

1218481,1,B00000I1LL,"This film is a remake of the 1962 horror classic of the same name.  The 1962 original was atmospheric, darkly poetic, haunting; its story a subtle balance between two alternate interpretations.
This is none of those.  This remake is a clunky mess, arbitrarily meandering through pointless  scenes and aimless ""monsters"" lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.
Aside from the monsters, a line, too, is lifted from JACOB'S LADDER.  The one about demons and angels.  This makes *some* sense, as both the  original CARNIVAL OF SOULS and JACOB'S LADDER are inspired by Bierce's  ""Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge.""
The 1962 film had a beginning,  a middle, and a twist ending.  This 1998 remake has numerous beginnings,  middles, and ends.  Scenes switch back and forth as the lead character  keeps ""waking up"" to indicate that all that went on before was a  dream.  If not for the rough road map provided by the original film, we'd  have an even murkier idea of what's going on.
Basically, a woman drives  into the river, and at times seems to have escaped, at times is just now  escaping, at times appears never to have driven into the river at  all...
Not clever, just confused and confusing.
The original film's  cool lead actress portrayed a young woman afraid of life, who ""hadn't  really lived.""  It was subtle, yet the point was made.  In this new  version, the character helpfully tells the audience that she ""hasn't  lived,"" in case we don't ""get it.""
The pedophilia  ""update"" to the original film's storyline doesn't add  anything.

Well, see, I once dated a woman who had been abused by a  neighbor in very much the same way the main character of this movie was  abused by Luis (Larry Miller).  Therefore, I personally found this movie to  be the most terrifying piece of film I have ever seen (ranking up there  with the last 15 minutes of ""Fire in the Sky"").
If you've ever  known anyone who has lived through that sort of ordeal, then you know that  the portrayal of a survivor done by Bobbie Grant is so realistic that it is  in itself horrifying, even without the supernatural, revenge-after-death  clown motif.
I did not find the ending confusing, as many others did  (much like ""Jacob's Ladder,"" I thought)but that was just  me....
Anyway--if you have never known anyone to experience anything like  this, then this movie probably will be boring and lame; if you have known  this kind of experience, then you certainly don't need this movie to  frighten you.",960249600,2,1165,4.655172413793103

Larry Miller ( the dad in 10 Things I Hate About You, and the voice of XR in the hit Buzz Lightyear of Star Command tv series) is beyond terrifying as a pedophile clown who torments our lead actress, Bobbie Phillips.

This film revolves around our main protagonist, Alex Grant. 20 years before, Alex witnessed the rape and murder of her mother at the hands of a sadistic carnival clown named Louis Seagram. 20 years later, Alex and her sister, Sandra are grown up and working as bartenders, while Louis has just been released from prison, just as the anniversary of their mother's death is approaching.

One night as she enters her car, she's confronted by Louis who snuck into her car and pulls a gun on her. In order to escape him, Alex drives her car off a dock and into a lake, which sets off a chain of haunting events.

From there on, Alex is haunted by a plague of evil and demonic-like visions while being tormented by Louis in a vile cat and mouse game of life or death.

Overall: Let me just start off by saying that if you want scares and kills, this movie is not for you. This is more of a psychological horror movie so the film focuses more on trying to get inside the character and viewer's mind rather than scaring. Unfortunately this movie turns out to be a complete bummer. I remember watching this many years ago but couldn't remember most of the film so I decided to buy it and watch it again. Not a good idea. The plot of it is great but the movie overall isn't all that great. The main reason being that it is extremely confusing and hard to keep up with. The movie constantly jumps all over the place from one setting to the next without there being any real explanation or reason why. For example Alex will have a vision she's in her car and then she'll be in her bathtub. Then later she'd be on a boat and then it'd jump to her being on a ferris wheel. They're so busy trying to take the movie so many places, they don't even explain the meaning of it and ultimately ends up making no sense.

Perhaps if they took the time to diligently make the movie less confusing, I'd have been more receptive to it and it would've earned maybe a 4/5 stars. The only thing that saves it from being a 1/5 is the decent plot. The ending is one of those endings where it leaves you with more questions than answers. Originally this movie was scheduled for a wide theatrical release in the Summer of 1998 but due to several negative critics on the movie in limited theatrical releases, it soon became a straight to video release. Not hard to see why, this film had potential to be great but unfortunately fell short. Don't bother watching this.
