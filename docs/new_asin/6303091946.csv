Some of the hair styles and the use of jewelry is very popular today.  It was so interesting to see the woman pursue her lost daugther untiringly as she was ""carried"" around throughout her journey.  I REALLY enjoyed it.",1108944000,4,354,4.223880597014926
569419,4,6303091946,"An experienced African trader overcomes tribal hostility.  Deep in the heart of Africa, famous hunter, explorer, Aloysius Horn - known as Trader Horn due to his bartering skills, tells Peru, the son of his best friend, that he was the first white man to set eyes on the river of which they are sailing...An amazing foray into adventurous early talkie cinema, this film shouldn't bore fans of cultish films from the thirties.  Filmed on location in Africa, based on the sensational 1927 best-selling novel by Alfred Aloysius Horn and Elthreda Lewis & photographed by the excellent Clyde de Vinna, this film is vintage fun!  During the filming, director Van Dyke and some crew members contracted malaria and were treated with quinine.  A native crew member was eaten alive by an alligator during the filming: tsetse flies, sunstrokes, flash floods & ant attacks all were endured by the crew members.  Nominated for the best picture of the 1931-32 season. Van Dyke was awarded the Red Cross Medal by the Japanese Government for his expertly detailed direction.  Thelma Todd was tested to play the role of Nina, Irving Thalberg once even considered Jeanette MacDonald for the part!  Remade in 1972 (poorly) with Rod Taylor and Anne Heywood, there was a cute Disney short from 1932 entitled TRADER MICKEY.

569697,5,6303091946,"In spite of a bit of racism and sexism (both relatively mild but obvious) this MGM classic is well worth the effort to find.  In the dawn of talkies, the studio decided to film an African adventure story...in Africa.  This was a first.  The proposed 2-week shoot turned into 6 months and laid up the leading lady (Edwina Booth) with an illness that lasted 5 years.

Aloysius ""Trader"" Horn isn't so much the great white hunter as he is the great white trader.  He offers trinkets, e. g. a music box, for elephant ivory (more political incorrectness).  In a trip down the river he is accompanied by Peru, the 22 year old son of his late best friend.  Peru is played by handsome Duncan Renaldo who went on to play one of my childhood heroes on TV, The Cisco Kid.

What makes the film special is an excellent story (more later) and some amazing photography that shows animals on the savanna in their natural environment.  This includes some scenes of animal-on-animal violence.  I was especially taken with 4 male lions fighting over a recently killed antelope.  The navigable river is loaded up with giant crocodiles.  This stuff isn't CGI.

Horn, Peru and the African bearers lead by Ranchero (Horn's gun bearer) must leave hurriedly after several tribes decide its juju time.  They get a little crazy and a couple white men would satisfy their thirst for blood.  As they find their way through the jungle they run into Edith Trent, a woman who has lived in Africa for decades.  She is played by Carey's real wife, Olive Golden.  Edith is determined to make a dangerous voyage up to and beyond the famous (and beautiful) Opanga Falls where she hopes to find her daughter who disappeared as a child years earlier.  She doesn't want the ever helpful Horn to go with her because ""white men with guns can cause violence.""  But Horn and Peru follow via river and from a distance.

Edith is found dead along the way, but Horn had promised to continue the search.  Eventually they find the daughter Nina (Booth), not a captive but a very white goddess who rules the Isorgi tribe.  Initially she sentences the men to death by fire (and later their meal perhaps) but changes her mind once her eyes meet Peru's.  She manages to get Horn, Peru and Ranchero out by traversing a large lake (Victoria?), but the natives aren't happy with her decision to leave and are on the hunt.

A few other interesting tidbits will get viewer's attention.  I don't think I've ever seen more bare-breasted woman in any one movie as are in this pre-code film.  You want to see boobs, here you go.  Even the alabaster skinned and quite beautiful Booth gives viewers a glimpse from the side.  Booth and Carey went on the next year to make ""The Last of the Mohicans"" where she played Cora Munro to Carey's Hawkeye.  This was the end of her very brief career, but she did receive a financial settlement for the studio's failure to protect her health while in Africa.

In spite of the PC issues which were not uncommon in the era of this film's production, ""Trader Horn"" provides some ground breaking location photography, much of which was used in many films later (""Tarzan, etc.)  This is a classic film that isn't available on DVD.",1382659200,2,3198,4.6070796460176995
569698,2,6303091946,There is some incredible footage in this movie and I'm a total fan of Harry Carey but not worth the price.,1370131200,,106,4.095238095238095
569699,4,6303091946,"If you're a fan of adventure films from the 30s and 40s you have 1931s ""Trader Horn"" to thank for providing most of the stock footage used as background and color. This is a virtual cornucopia of life on the African plains in the early 30s - natives, flora, and just about every conceivable form of animal life. Plus there are great pictures of leopards fighting with a chimp troop, lions fighting for a zebra, wart hogs under attack, etc.

The film is based on the 1927 autobiography ""Trader Horn"". Horn was an Ivory hunter in central Africa, and died prior to the film's release. The opening credits claim the film is based on ""the book by Ethelreda Lewis"" but in fact Lewis was the editor of Horn's book and not the author. It was shot in Tanganyika, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan, and The Congo as well as Mexico and covered more than 14,000 miles of ""African veldt and jungle.""

Harry Carey Sr. plays Trader Horn. Carey was one of the first western stars of the silent film era, and we have him to thank for getting John Ford his first few jobs. Over a 40 year career he appeared in more than 200 films and was nominated once for ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939). Carey was a hero to the young John Wayne, and Carey's son, Harry Carey Jr., was virtually adopted by the Duke and appeared in dozen of Wayne's films beginning with ""Red River"" (1948).

His wife Olive (Golden) Carey (1896-1988) has a brief role as a missionary whose husband was killed and daughter stolen by natives, and 20 years later she has a tip and enlists Horn's help to find her. When she returned from weeks of hard work in Africa she was paid $300 and then fired. But a few weeks later MGM needed her for some pick up shots, and she refused unless they paid her $1000, which they reluctantly did. Carey went on to have a long and productive career, appearing in more than 50 films and most of the major films of John Ford and John Wayne.

Beautiful Edwina Booth (1904-1911) plays Carey's daughter, now a princess of a native tribe. During filming, Booth developed a severe infection and spent the next 6 years trying to recover. She sued MGM and they settled out of court, but her film career was over. She managed to make a few more films, the most notable being ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1932) in which she played Cora Munro (the one who lives).

In addition to Booth's health problems, the months long shoot in 1929 in Africa was plagued with problems including crew being eaten by crocodiles and killed by a charging rhino, both of which are captured on film. The film also was originally conceived as a silent film but then converted to a talkie. Much of the footage shot in Africa had to be reshot to get better sound. As a result, the film cost more than $3 million, which was an enormous sum for that time.

Spanish born Duncan Renaldo (1904-1980) plays Horn's sidekick. Renaldo is best remembered for TV's ""The Cisco Kid"" (1950-56), a role he originated in 1945. His career began in 1928 and he was popular in 30s and 40s serials.

FWIW - Renaldo and Booth were suspected of having an affair by Renaldo's wife, and the publicity associated with her law suit resulted in uncovering the fact that Renaldo was an illegal alien. Only the intervention of Eleanor Roosevelt saved Renaldo's career.

The great C Aubrey Smith (1863-1948) has a tiny role as a store keeper at the end of the film. Smith appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949 and gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in ""The Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), Lord Capulet in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1936), and Colonel Zapt in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" (1937). I remember him best as Col. Williams in ""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) with Shirley Temple and as Jane's father in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" (1932).

FWIW - Aubrey's role was so small that when audiences first viewed it they laughed.

Woody van Dyke (1889-1943) directs. Best known for his ""Thin Man"" films, for which he received an Oscar nomination in 1935, he also received a nomination for ""San Francisco"" (1936) and directed Nelson Eddy and Jeanette Macdonald in 6 of their films. Van Dyke enjoyed exotic locations and made such films as ""Heart of the Yukon"" (1927), ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), ""Eskimo"" (1933), ""Northwest Passage"" (1940) and ""Cairo"" (1942). His nickname was ""one take"" because he liked to get the shot in one take, which made him invaluable to MGM from a cost POV.

The beautiful (and at times breath taking) photography is courtesy of Clyde De Vinna (1890-1953) who began work in 1915 (""The 3 Musketeers"") and was famous for his on location shots including films like this one, ""Eskimo"" (1933), and ""White Shadows in the South Seas"" (1928), for which he won an Oscar. He worked on several Tarzan films in the 30s and 40s and eventually ended up in TV in the 50s (""The Roy Rogers Show"").

FWIW - van Dyke made the first Tarzan film with Johnny Weissmuller (1932) and it included C Aubrey Smith and was photographed by De Vinna.

1931 was a great year for film. The top grossing films were ""Frankenstein"", ""Cimarron"", ""Mata Hari"", ""City Lights"", and ""Dracula"". The Oscars went to ""Cimarron"" (Picture), ""The Champ"" (Actor), and ""Min and Bill"" (Actress). Other notable films released that year include  ""M"", ""Public Enemy"", ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde"", and ""Monkey Business"".

The NY Times said ""Thrilling realism is spliced cleverly with rugged fiction"" and called it a ""shrewdly fashioned jungle melodrama.""

Bottom line - an historically important film.

(Viewed today this film shows some of the terrible things people have done to animals, including hunting them to near extinction for their tusks and hides. Even in 1929 Americans were atuned to these abuses so some of the filming took place in Mexico where the studio was able to engineer scenes that would be forbidden in the US. We've come a long way since then in our treatment of animals, both on screen and in the real world, so the film has to be viewed in the context of 1931.

In addition, the film suffers from the 19th Century ""white man's burden"" in its view of Africa and the people who live there. As abhorrent as this is, again we need to take comfort in how far we've come.)",1329609600,7,6207,4.581605049594229
569700,5,6303091946,"First viewed Trader Horn on TV when 10 years old (1963). Never had seen anything like it before or since. The scenes and ""special effects"" of the wild animals is awesome for its day. The story behind the movie provided by the TV moderator concerning the lead actress having her promising career end with this movie added to the mystique and danger portrayed on film. In early 2000, read the book ""Trader Horn"". It was more realistic and just as exciting an adventure as the 1930s movie. The real Horn survived due to his willingness to learn and become knowledgeable in the ways of the indigenous peoples. He noted every other European who were in his group upon his arrival in Africa had died due to disease or other peril. He had been nursed back to health by the natives using their medicines. Both movie and book are terrific stories. The movie & book provides a glimpse of Africa (1870s) when the wildlife seemed inexhaustable. Truly, a time gone by.",1301011200,,955,4.623529411764705

569702,4,6303091946,"I had been checking out a number of Oscar winners and nominees from the late 20's and early 30's; films I'd never seen before.  There were some impressive film and some that didn't score well in the test of time.  I watched ""Trader Horn"" last night and I have to admit that I was very impressed.  There is a lot that is dated about the movie (in more ways than one).  The opening credits let me know that there was going to be a lot of film from remote African locations.  As I was absorbing more of the credits I was somewhat aghast for the credits of several ""White Hunters"".  This film reminded me a lot of other films of the era that had phrases such as ""Mighty White of you"" and things of that sort.  I was also reminded of the movie ""Tabu"" which led me to understand that female nudity was tolerated back then if it was ""natural"" (and non-white).  In this day and age of political correctness it seems necessary for such disclaimers.  However, ""Trader Horn"" give viewers a lot of things to enjoy despite the occassional red faces.

There is a lot of action of many varieties in ""Trader Horn""; man vs. man, man vs. nature, nature vs. nature.  There are a number of relationships that are fairly well developed.  There is also a rather educational series of wild life scenes in which trader Horn describes some of the lesser known forms of African mammals.  There are some other live action scenes that may appeal more to the hunters out there.  One scene of a wounded and dying rhinocerus was way beyond the standard wildlife shots we usually see.  There were a number of scenes of African tribes.  I'm not sure of the background of these of these scenes but I was fairly satisfied that these actual tribal groups.  The chanting and the drums were nearly hypnotic at times.  It just seemed that there was so much more to ""Trader Horn"" than what we would normally see in a movie of this era.",1264291200,3,1895,4.412103746397695
569703,5,6303091946,"Not many films of the ""Great White Hunter"" genre in Africa are as powerful as TRADER HORN.  Made in 1931, director W. S. Van Dyke shows a view of Africa that has little to do with the megafauna popularized by Johnny Weismuller just a few years later. The actors had a miserable time filming nearly every scene.  The weather was unbearably muggy, the mosquitoes ubiquitous, and the daily threat of disease and death from predatory animals was never far from the set.  Harry Carey was a superlative choice for the lead as Trader Horn, a grizzled Great White Hunter type who agrees to lead an expedition to the Heart of Africa, which goes predictably disastrous when natives attack, killing many of his bearers.  Duncan Renaldo, who would later achieve fame as television's Cisco Kid, is Peru, an inexperienced junior hunter who falls for the female lead played by Edwina Booth, who is the daughter of the woman Horn is sent to find.  Horn and Peru find her and it is no surprise that, having grown up as a Great White Goddess, she shows no small reluctance to leave with them for the comforts of a far distant white culture.

TRADER HORN is a murky celebration of an Africa that is only hinted at in future jungle films.  There is no bare-chested hero yodeling at frightened natives, though Miss Booth does precisely that on more than one occasion.  Harry Carey's etched in stone face tells us all we need to know that an expedition to the jungles of darkest Africa is as dangerous as it looks.  There are literally no moments of respite for the wayfarers until the very end.  Hungry predator animals abound.  Natives of various ethnic stripes are further menaces.  It is too easy for PC audiences to grimace each time Trader Horn gives off a racially tinged comment, but such comments tell more about the milieu of Horn's society than it does about himself, especially after his reaction to his prized gun bearer who takes a spear meant for him. Horn is visibly moved by the sacrifice.  Director Van Dyke unwisely tried to inject a plot complicating factor of jealousy between Horn and Peru over the revealingly clad form of Miss Booth, but Horn quickly enough accepts that the love of a young woman is reserved for a young man.  TRADER HORN emerges as a sobering journey into the dark spot of a continent even as it does so for an equally sobering expedition into the collective psyche of an audience that looked for thrills of a jungle nature but settled for the disquieting realization that brutishness is not limited to geography.",1262390400,3,2533,4.675675675675675
569704,4,6303091946,"...and you can see why this film caught the attention of the Academy at the time. For the same reasons that viewing live musical performances from 1970's TV don't excite in the age of the Ipod, anyone who views this from the perspective of someone who has 24/7 access to Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel won't get what the big deal is of seeing Africa's wildlife on film. From today's standards, the wildlife isn't even that clearly photographed. In 1931, though, most people had never seen such sights.

When I first saw the year this film was made and that it was a startling 123 minutes long for a film made in the early 30's, I somewhat suspected I was going to be subject to some preposterous maudlin melodrama in the MGM tradition that went on forever, but it is packed with action and has a very good story. The story involves seasoned African adventurer Aloysius ""Trader"" Horn (Harry Carey) taking Peru (Duncan Renaldo), 23 year-old son of an old friend, on his first big adventure into Africa. Along the way they run into a missionary, also a friend of Horn. She has been preaching among the natives and seeking the daughter that was stolen from her by the natives for twenty years. Soon thereafter, Horn and Peru are captured by a group of natives led by a young white woman - presumed to be the daughter of the missionary woman. Horn, Peru, and their native gun bearer are slated for a horrible execution by the natives unless the young white girl intercedes on their behalf. If she does will the other natives even listen? And if they do listen, how will our protagonists get back to the closest trading post without their guns, which have been confiscated by their captors? Some of the language tossed around, such as Trader Horn calling the African villagers ""monkeys"" will likely cause you to cringe, but - again - you must remember this dialog is a product of its time. The film did show a surprising and touching camaraderie between Horn and his native gun bearer, Rencharo.

Also note the precode element in this film. Native women are plainly shot unclothed from the waist up, which is probably very much based in reality. If this film had been made five years later that would not have happened. Of course, even in the precode era, this might be OK for the native ""savages"" but not for the grown white girl raised by them. She has a kind of make-shift fur top on that still shows a great deal, but not everything.

The film elements on this one are somewhat shaggy, the contrast is poor, and it cries out for restoration. In spite of all of this, I still recommend it to fans of this era of film-making as a unique cinematic experience.",1262390400,5,2663,4.555323590814196
569705,4,6303091946,"I've seen this movie a number of times and just watched it again on TCM to analyze, as well as I can, one specific scene.  Horn and his entourage are fleeing from angry natives and are starving.  They decide that, despite the fact that Horn and his white comrade are armed only with clubs and his gunbearer armed only with a long spearlike stick, that they must manage to drive lions from a prey animal.  Like I said, they are starving.

The scene involves a charging lion.  The gunbearer, or his stunt double, throw the long 'stick' which seems to hit the lion squarely between the eyes.  The lion runs off, shaking his head with the end of the 'stick' embedded in his head.  The lion piles up and dies...but this scene occurs so fast that I'm not sure that the dying animal is still with 'stick.'  Immediately afterwards, the gunbearer removes his stick from the lion's head.

My question is....Is this simply excellent editing for 1931 or is it [more-or-less] the real thing.  Is the whole thing faked i.e. is a long stick attached to the head of a studio lion and filmed trying to shake it out....or....is the animal actually speared between the eyes by a very brave African?  I opt for the first but still can't be sure.

Other than that, the film is dated but entertaining.  In some ways it is reminiscent of a Martin and Ossa Johnson animal-Africa film of a few years earlier.  The scenes of menacing dancing natives are quite good.  Many of the animal scenes are certainly faked but it is, afterall, 1931.  I'm rather amazed that they were able to produce such a film in a remote African location at this early time.  I especially enjoyed the transition of the young white woman from an intractible, savage princess to a soft human being.

569706,4,6303091946,"Trader Horn is an adventure film like none that could be made today. The wilderness of Africa is no longer as wild as it was in the 1930s; too much has been civilized. The film concerns a man named Aloysius Horn (Harry Carey)and his handsome protg Peru (Duncan Renaldo). The two travel in an expedition to trade with the natives for ivory, but when a Juju curse is put into effect, they have to abandon their intent and just try to survive. In the process, they meet up with a white woman, a missionary whose husband was killed by a tribe and whose daughter was stolen. Horn makes a promise to help her, and even when she dies, he continues on his quest to finding the daughter, by now a white savage.

What separates this film from other jungle movies like the Tarzan films is the extent of real footage from Africa that is used. This film could be used almost as a tour guide for Africa; it details information about many animals with real footage of them in the wild. Also, unlike the Tarzan films, this one shows real respect for the natives and for their lives.

This film brings out the child in its audience. Although the story isn't incredibly strong, it is hard not to get wrapped up in the fun of it all.",1148860800,20,1214,4.343612334801762
