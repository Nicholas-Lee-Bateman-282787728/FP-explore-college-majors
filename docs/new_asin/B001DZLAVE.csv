3544180,5,B001DZLAVE,"As an adult, I found this movie old and boring.  My 2-year-old, however, was enthralled!  He loves trains and could not get enough of watching this dvd.  He would watch and continuously say ""shoo"" which is his way of saying choo-choo!",1317513600,3,234,4.658536585365853

3544183,4,B001DZLAVE,"It was very informative. My grandson is 2 1/2 and he would stop and watch it a while but, it didn't keep his attention for very long. Really is geared more for an older child, I think.",1308700800,,184,4.0

He has thoroughly enjoyed watching this dvd and learning all about real trains.  He was rather amazed one had to study so much and so long to become an engineer.  He told his grandmother...""I don't think I want to study that much...how much do you have to study to become a pirate?""  He loves the dvd, however!",1289779200,13,445,4.815789473684211

3544233,3,B001DZLAVE,"A good dvd for train lovers. My 2 year old grandson loved watching the trains but got bored by the people talking and being interviewed. Maybe when he gets older ,he will like that part! There are several other sections on the dvd, like the alphabet train, that would hold older kids interest longer. Don't buy this dvd and Adventure with Trains dvd at the same time ,because they include some of the same sections.....I didn't read the reviews closely enough! If I were to buy again, I would only purchase this one because it is longer and includes other sections.",1429488000,3,565,4.603960396039604

3544246,5,B001DZLAVE,We bought this dvd for our son (age 5 ) who loves trains. We have watched it over and over and over again to the point mommy and daddy are going a little train crazy too lol. Great dvd for kid's who love trains. Very Satisfied. : ),1394409600,,231,3.8333333333333335
3544247,5,B001DZLAVE,Our grandson has always been crazy about trains.  This DVD is very informative about the way we still depend on and use trains.  He asks to watch it often.,1393632000,,155,4.310344827586207
3544248,2,B001DZLAVE,"I bought this DVD for my 2 year-old grandson who simply adores trains.  He started watching for the first few minutes than completely ignored it.  I continued watching to see if the video would get better, but instead, I even became bored with it. At one point, the video contains a long interview with the train's conductor which totally would make a toddler uninterested.  The DVD is educational, but for much older ""Kids""",1393372800,,424,4.780821917808219
3544249,5,B001DZLAVE,My grandson has enjoyed this which is what I wanted. Hence 5 stars and my recommendation as a birthday present for a two year old.,1392940800,,130,4.24

3544251,4,B001DZLAVE,"Purchased a used copy, came on time, in good condition. I thought it would be move videos of just trains chugging along, but it has lots of informational stuff like how trains run and train safety. Even though its a lot of talking my train crazy 2yr old is fixated on it.",1388102400,,271,4.230769230769231
3544252,5,B001DZLAVE,"My 4 year old grandson loves Thomas the Tank Engine and from that love came a love for all trains. He sometimes watches this over and over for hours and hours. It's just a bunch of documentary bits about trains, but it has captivated him and his 2 year old brother. The only criticism I could give is that there's one segment where a train engineer is explaining some fail-safe device. He says that if she should die while driving the train, that it would safely handle the train. I think the kids don't need to hear that a train engineer could suddenly die while driving a train. What were they thinking in not editing that out? But this doesn't keep these kids from being fascinated with the trains.",1384300800,,701,4.441860465116279
3544253,2,B001DZLAVE,Pretty dull narration.  Lot of video of trains and how they work but seems more aimed to older kidsor even adults.  We were looking for something for a 4 year old and this did not hold his interest despite being a huge fan of all things train.,1380758400,,243,4.148936170212766
3544254,1,B001DZLAVE,my 2 year old grandson loves trains (anything trains) and this said for kids---not at all able to hold their attention--way too dry and boring,1376265600,3,142,4.72

3544256,5,B001DZLAVE,His favortie parts is the ones with Santa on the train. He loves watching in over and over  and over again,1370908800,,106,4.0476190476190474
3544257,5,B001DZLAVE,My grandson learned a lot about the different types of trains from this movie...and we have taken him to see many of them at the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore Maryland - great place to visit...,1367884800,,196,4.472222222222222
3544258,3,B001DZLAVE,"My grandson is train crazy, didn't hold his attention, there are probably better train dvd's out there.  Don't think it is worth buying.",1365465600,,136,4.913043478260869
3544268,5,B001DZLAVE,Bought this DVD for my son that loves trains been buying any trains I could find and he loved this one too,1364947200,,106,3.8636363636363638
3544269,3,B001DZLAVE,The movie is ok. A little too much talking about the mechanics for my daughter (age3). Would be better for an older child.,1363737600,3,122,4.3478260869565215
3544270,5,B001DZLAVE,Also bought this for my grandson that loves trains and he loves this one also. Argues with himself as to which one to watch first.,1362960000,,130,4.24
3544271,1,B001DZLAVE,"Poor quality and boring, even for my boy who is in love with trains.  The narrators voice is uninteresting and slow.",1361836800,,116,4.523809523809524
3544272,5,B001DZLAVE,"The five year old loves this video. It's not Thomas or Mighty MAchines, but very nicely explains a lot about the railroad!",1361664000,,122,4.590909090909091
3544273,4,B001DZLAVE,"My grandson loves trains and i thought this would be good for him, however it is too technical and too wordy for him. he is six years old. i put it on mute so he can just watch the trains and he likes it better.",1360281600,,211,3.7111111111111112
3544274,4,B001DZLAVE,"the movie met my expectations. it was very full of information on all kinds of trains, my son loved to watch it.",1358640000,,112,4.136363636363637

3544277,3,B001DZLAVE,"My son loves trains and the title is ""Train Crazy Kids,"" but it seems more geared toward older children. Definitely not for toddlers or preschool children. There isn't enough to keep their attention for long. The film is long but drawn out and pretty much boring.",1354060800,4,263,4.739130434782608
3544287,5,B001DZLAVE,"my son loves trains, I am looking forward to viewing it at xmas
looks like a good movie for my 6 year old",1351814400,,105,3.608695652173913
3544288,1,B001DZLAVE,I was so disapointed with this dvd. This was my first purchase and I awaited it anxiously as my nephew is train crazy. The dvd was damaged and wouldnt even play! My nephew was so bummed out and so was I because I thought it would be a real treat for him. There shouldnt be broken dvds. I would have gladly paid more for one that worked!,1346284800,,336,4.029850746268656
3544289,2,B001DZLAVE,My son loves Thomas the Tank Engine. He also enjoys see trains in person. He has no interest in this video. It's an old production. Bottom line....not for a 2-3 year old.,1341446400,2,170,4.34375
3544290,5,B001DZLAVE,"This is a great DVD. My son loves it! Its educational which we love, and entertaining for our son. He has watched part of it probably at least once a day since we got it. I highly recommend this for toddlers and preschoolers!",1338940800,,225,4.255813953488372
3544291,5,B001DZLAVE,"I purchased this for my three year old son who loves trains. He watches this video over and over again, he just cant get enough!",1329523200,,128,4.16
3544292,3,B001DZLAVE,"I must say the reviews were what led me to buy this dvd.  My 5 year old eats, breathes, and sleeps trains.  That being said he really only likes steam trains.  He is coming around on diesel locomotives because he sees them up close at my work.  However, he had no interest in this dvd.  It could not hold his attention.  The footage is just not very interesting.  My son has outgrown Thomas, and has nearly outgrown his train table.  He hates Chuggington as well.  What my son asks to watch repeatedly is a show called ""Trains and Locomotives."" It comes on RFDTV channel 345 on directv.  It is a show for railroad enthusiasts.  Before buying this dvd you might want to record a couple of episodes of this.  Like this dvd, neither are very good quality.  Mostly shot from poor angles with bad lighting and poor image stabilization.  I think what my son really enjoys about the tv show is that it spends a lot of time up close to the engines.  You see all the steam and smoke and you here all the noises.  The dvd shows you a lot of different trains but it doesn't get up close and personal with them.  To truly keep a child's attention I think the dvd needed to do more of this.",1326412800,6,1177,4.253393665158371
3544293,4,B001DZLAVE,"I'm not gonna lie- I thought this was going to be dumb. There's terrible narration, it's slow and pretty boring, and there's a part called 'ABC train' that goes through the alphabet that's REALLY tedious but my 3 year old LOVES LOVES LOVES it. Asks to watch it all the time. He can sit through the boring 'ABC train' part like its the coolest thing ever and has really learned about trains, their parts, and the different kinds of trains. I guess I'm learning a lot too through repetition.

Trust the other positive reviews of this DVD. I was more shocked than anyone that my kid loves it the way he does.",1325116800,4,605,4.401785714285714
3544294,5,B001DZLAVE,"I bought this train movie for my 4 year old grandson, and he and I watched it together. He and I both really loved the whole movie, and the sound was fantastic from the trains, and all the information that we were given, made it well worth watching it many more times in the near future! I want a copy for myself!!!",1323648000,2,315,4.096774193548387
3544295,5,B001DZLAVE,This movie goes through the different types of trains in existence.  A nice little DVD for kids who absolutely love trains.,1320451200,2,123,4.857142857142857
3544296,5,B001DZLAVE,"If my toddler was on the Oscars voting rolls, he would have lobbied his peers until this video won an entire slate of awards.  This is the Titantic, the Jurassic Park, the Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings of live action train videos.  My toddler has memorized each frame of two of the four  included videos: ""Alphabet Train"" and ""I Want to be an Engineer"", to the extent that he will actually call out what train will appear next at any given time.  If this were 10 years ago and I  owned it on VHS, I'd be on my third or fourth tape, because a couple would have snapped by now through overuse.

The videos provide solid, commercial free content that will go a nice way to teaching your child the alphabet and the nuts and bolts workings of an important and interesting industry.  I'd rather he watch this for hours over Miley Cyrus (no offense intended to the Cyrus family) or whatever else is on commercial TV these days.

From a price perspective, you cannot go wrong here.  If your child enjoys trains, he'll get four separate videos on the disk, each of which will hold his interest for its entirety.

If you are a train enthusiast yourself, you'll notice a midwest and west coast bias to what is shown here.  You won't see any Northeast corridor movements or Conrail sets (so no super fast Acela runs).  You will get a lot of western landscapes and a good deal of transit movements in Seattle circa 2000 or so.",1318896000,23,1416,4.403846153846154
