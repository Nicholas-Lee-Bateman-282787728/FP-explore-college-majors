2651561,5,B000I2JCAY,"I have every DVD program that Ravi Singh & Ana Brett have released, & they just get better & better -- smoother, more professional, higher quality production.  It is hard to imagine how they could top these last three.

When I began doing their first workout, Kundalini for Beginners & Beyond, I was a year beyond unsuccessful back surgery, in pain, & on drugs because of it.  These workouts enabled me to get so far beyond back problems that it doesn't seem possible that I was ever so impeded.

Yoga's potential to help people with back problems is amazing, & Ravi & Ana's DVDs are a great place to start.  Even if a movement is not specifically targeted to the back, yoga is so holistic that it works on many parts of the body at once, including the back.",1163635200,30,758,4.424460431654676
2651562,4,B000I2JCAY,"Although I actually took a Kundalini yoga workshop with instructors Ana Brett and Ravi Singh in 2005, this was only the second of their DVDs that I have tried, as my home practice tends to consist of more traditional forms of Hatha yoga. I expect that I will now include some Kundalini as part of my home practice, either via Yoga Beauty Body or one of Ana and Ravi's other recent releases. Unlike their live workshops, Ana and Ravi's DVDs feature Ana only on screen, with both Ana and Ravi providing instruction via voiceover. Yoga Beauty Body is a 55-minute full-body practice, with the yoga postures being grouped into two main sets. The DVD chapter menu breaks down as follows (I've added approximate times and brief details):

Introduction (1 minute)
Tune In (just under 2.5 minutes)--includes ong namo guru dev namo chant
Breath Primer (4 minutes)--practice deep breathing and breath of fire [BOF]
Warm-Ups (4 minutes)--stomach grinds, ragdoll (fast head-to-knee pose performed repeatedly)
Yoga Set 1 (17 minutes)--baby (child's pose), baby with raised head and BOF, rock pose (hero), deep lunge, reclined rock (hero) with BOF, chair (sort of squat; different from the hatha version) with BOF, lie on stomach to rest, butterfly with rocking and forward bend, hip raises, rolling, locust with feet crossed, bow (2x), rest, stretch pose (lying supine with legs raised 6 inches) with BOF; includes brief pauses to meditate throughout
Yoga Set 2 (16 minutes)--move legs in and out while lying supine, rolling, moving arms up and down while lying on stomach (triceps work), seated arm circles with BOF, camel with BOF, kneeling forward bend, shoulderstand with BOF, plow, rolling, cobra with wide legs, rest, baby's pose, sat kriya (squeeze lower organs and hold to sat, breathe out to nam); includes brief pauses to meditate throughout
Deep Relaxation (3 minutes)--relaxation pose
Meditation (4.5 minutes)--lying on stomach, ""play"" fingers mantra (touch thumbs to each finger in succession) while repeating sa ta na ma to yourself
Closing Prayer (1 minute)--pray for self, other, world peace

Since the final 9 minutes of this workout are focused on relaxation, the active practice segment is only about 45 minutes. This DVD does not include any premixes, but it is well-chaptered, so you could easily make the practice even shorter by skipping the breath primer once you are familiar with Kundalini breathing styles. For someone who has experience with and enjoys Kundalini yoga, I think this DVD would be an excellent choice. I particularly liked how progressively more challenging backbends are gradually incorporated into the practice, culminating with bow pose. However, because I tend to prefer my yoga practices to be more on the gentle side, I found this workout to be a bit more strenuous than what I was looking for. Personally, I think I prefer to keep my Kundalini work limited to shorter sessions, either via selecting particular chapters from this DVD only or using another Ana/Ravi DVD which includes premixes (such as Dance the Chakras).  Therefore, for my own particular needs, this practice, while very good, was not a perfect fit.  However, those who are more used to the Kundalini style are more likely to click with this workout, which is certainly very well-done.  Overall, this is a well-produced, well-organized Kundalini practice, and I expect that it will be well-liked by fans of Ana and Ravi's other works.",1162166400,132,3436,5.128571428571429
2651563,5,B000I2JCAY,"This is another winner from Ana & Ravi!!! I absolutely love this set!!! It's not too long and not too short, just right!!! I love all the poses and this DVD didn't have any drag factor for me... I feel like I'm doing wonders for my body by practicing these poses!!! Really great for women!! It makes me feel more complete and radiant!!!!

Thanks Ana and Ravi for another wonderful kundalini yoga set!!!!",1160611200,40,403,4.52054794520548
2651564,5,B000I2JCAY,"This is a great workout for women.  I won't bore you with details as another reviewer provided those.  I will say that I have three comments.  First, after the SA TA NA MA meditation, Ravi just ends it abrubtly.  If you go to kundalini yoga classes you know that you inhale hold, then exhale to end meditation. Sometimes you do this 3x.  Second, I felt that the editing was a little jagged, it wasn't as smooth as thier previous DVD's.  Lastly, I felt that there was something missing at the end of the DVD. I couldn't figure it out until later.  Aha! I said.  The Adi Shatki mantra meditation would have been perfect to end this class.  You can find a good version of it on Sada Sat Kaur's CD.  This is a mantra of devotion to the creative, feminine power of the universe.  Also, instead of the SA TA NA meditaion, the Grace of God meditation would have been sweet.  Next time I do this DVD I will add these in.  Otherwise great dvd to add to my rotation. Someone wrote that only plastic surgery will make you beautiful.  Beauty comes from within.  Yogi Bhajan said that kundlaini yoga and meditation will give you radiance that lights you up from within so that when people look at your face, they see God in you. No plastic surgery can give you that!",1160611200,17,1253,4.3405172413793105
2651565,3,B000I2JCAY,"This DVD contains some wonderful exercises and are shown to perfection by Ana Brett.  Unfortunately, I was really turned off by the constant mention of beauty/firming talk.  During shoulder stand, it was mentioned that it will bring out the beauty in your face.  The only thing that will make my face beautiful is plastic surgery, not doing the shoulderstand. It is one thing to talk about looking radiantly healthy, but the constant body image talk trivialized the workout and ruined it for me.",1160611200,20,495,4.9397590361445785
2651566,5,B000I2JCAY,"This well rounded yoga workout, great for women. (though my boyfriend likes it too). Features the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which are poses considered essential for daily practice.

These include: bow pose, locust pose, camel pose, shoulder stand and more.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that this workout is just poses. It's dynamic in its blend of movement, breathing, cool music and commentary.

As a long time dance and movement addict, I think I can safely say that if you practice this regularly, not only will you get a beautiful body but a beautiful mind as well.",1160438400,26,575,4.907216494845361
2651607,5,B000I2JCAY,Raviana beauty body is great not my favorite but still a good workout...update my feelings about this dvd has changed when I first got this dvd back in 2014 the first part of my review was my feelings but as of a few weeks ago I got up one morning and my body was literally craving this workout so I dusted it off and did it and I now love this workout I know it seems hard to believe but it is true this really happened to me I could not believe it myself  Ana and Ravi DVDs are awesome try this or any one of their DVDs you will not be disappointed I promise you.,1421366400,2,565,3.8706896551724137
2651608,5,B000I2JCAY,"Bought this DVD in 2008 (I think), tried a few segments, thought it was a little weird, so it sat on the shelf for quite a while.  Fast forward to 2012, when I was struggling with hypothyroidism and adrenal fatigue and desperate to feel better.  I was reading everything I could find on natural remedies and was willing to try just about anything.  Decided to try this DVD again since I read that Kundalini Yoga has great benefits for those with hypothyroidism.  Boy, am I glad I kept this!  I do it at least once a week now, and every time I do it I feel amazing afterwards!  I'm trying to convince my hubby to do it with me because I want him to feel this great, too.  Now, I'm not trying to say that this DVD alone has helped clear up my hypothyroid symptoms - this is just one of many lifestyle changes I made.  It's the cumulative effect of all the things I've done that have relieved my most bothersome symptoms and allowed me to reduce my medication.  This is a wonderful workout to add to anyone's repertoire!",1410825600,8,1017,4.310526315789474
2651609,4,B000I2JCAY,"Another pleasant Kundalini set from Ravi and Ana.  I like their upbeat music, I wish  I could buy their music separate from their Dvds.  Their music encourages you to finish the whole set, even when you otherwise might think you're getting tired.  I gave this only 4 out of 5 because I wish it was a longer workout.  Leaving out the tuning in and meditations, the active sets will give you a great 30 to 40 minutes of sweat, some of their other Dvds give you a full hour.  I really like all of their Dvds that have the matrix option to put together your own work out.  Use that to repeat a set and you can make this workout longer.

on a side note, if you are used to Kundalini classes where the people where turbans and cover up, Ana wears hot pants and a sports bra.  Whether that's a plus or minus is up to you - you're supposed to have your eyes closed! lol.  Do this workout and make your own body beauty.",1410134400,3,910,4.119318181818182
2651610,5,B000I2JCAY,My 2nd favorite Raviana DVD. This workout is slightly on the shorter side and I tend to do it a couple times a week.,1407024000,,116,3.875
2651611,1,B000I2JCAY,It doesn't make you look good as the instructor. Some posture is difficult for people who never do yoga before.,1405123200,,111,4.6
2651612,5,B000I2JCAY,"This was my first time trying this kind of yoga.  I've usually done the more traditional kind they offer at the gym and power yoga which I don't like at all.  I enjoyed the simplicity of the ""studio"" and Ana Brett is interesting to look at.  I enjoyed that there were lots of movements but did not feel fast paced.  I didn't get restless from doing the same poses over and over because it isn't like that.  I like that it tells you what part of your body each movement helps.  He does a good job of reminding you where to ""look"" when your eyes are closed.  Overall very relaxing for me.

Some negatives: They don't always show you the modified poses.  They also miss shooting some of the transitions from one pose to another.

I call this my ""hippy dippy"" yoga when I report to my workout group.  I really enjoyed it and actually ordered another one of their DVDs.",1397779200,,864,4.304347826086956
2651613,1,B000I2JCAY,Not as good as it sound. I have a few other DVDs of theirs and I loved them. It was a waste of money to purse this one.,1395619200,,119,3.2857142857142856
2651614,5,B000I2JCAY,"I have 17 of Ana & Ravi DVD's which says it all
I think they are the best teachers of Kundalini Yoga ( Maya fines is also OK and the others are far behind)
The flow of the practice, explantions, variety, music - all sums up to great daily practice I enjoy
The matrix option is not the best, but it does allow you to build your own set for the day.
This one is also one of my favorites which I do more than the others.
Its enjoyable and streaming well, but some of the practices are too hard for me , so I do a variation.",1386633600,8,520,3.824074074074074
2651615,2,B000I2JCAY,"It was OK.

I am new to this type of Yoga.  But this is way beyond my ability.  I will give this another try sometime in the future after I have mastered some more basic workouts.

I did like Ana Brett.  I wish it had just been her doing the instruction.",1385078400,,254,3.9019607843137254
2651616,5,B000I2JCAY,"This is a good all over Kundalini Kriya.  If you do the whole thing all the way through it is around 45 minutes.  I think it is a good second dvd after either of their Beginner's tapes.  I also think this one is good for flexibility in that it seems to hit everything.  It is the classic white back ground and dark haired Ana.  Music as always is great.  Again, good introduction to Kunadlini style yoga.",1379721600,,404,4.25

I saw really good reviews of her so I decided to go for it. I don't even know how to describe how awful this is. It was slow, cheesy, boring and contains of poses I don't recognise. I had to skip through the DVD a lot thinking there would be more challenging good poses but no! I owe about 70 workout DVDs from all the famous trainers and usually go through them all several times but I regret to say that I won't even go back to this DVD again. It was a waste of money. I have three other yoga DVDs and I would recommend Lara Hudson's 10 solution yoga practice best! Don't waste your money on this one!",1374019200,2,904,4.027777777777778

If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class.

What makes their DVDs so extraordinary is a combination of the pacing, the demonstrations/explanations, and the affirmations they share throughout. I find myself using the mantras they've taught me throughout my day, alleviating stress with the breathing techniques they use in the video, and reminding myself to ""do my best and be so blessed."" Theirs are by far the best workout videos I have ever used, and I would strongly recommend them to anyone-- regardless of yoga experience or fitness level.",1369008000,2,665,4.833333333333333

2651635,5,B000I2JCAY,I researched a lot of yoga CD's and read reviews till I got tired of wanting to do yoga. This struck me the minute I saw it. I liked that it was for beginners to begin with :). When I did my first exercise I laughed thru the whole thing. The guy narrating it was so corney sounding. He then began to grow on me and the exercises seemed to be a little more than just a beginners yoga. They are relaxing but yet they certainly make you feel as though you've had a good workout. The breathing exercises were amazing in that they really did help get my stomach tighter. I would recommend this CD to all those who are not sure about yoga and want the privacy in doing it in your own home. It will make you feel guilty if you don't do it on a daily basis.

2651667,5,B000I2JCAY,"I was lucky enough to find Ravi Singh kundalini workout videos over a decade ago prior to Ana joining his team. The current combination of them working together is even better and more inspiring. I have several of their DVDs and 'Yoga Beauty Body' continues to be my very favorite.

When I first did yoga over 15 years ago, I was incredibly uncomfortable with the 'typical' repetitive poses, the sun salutations, etc. It just did not feel right to me and I always felt that my natural timing was so different from the way traditional yoga was done. That is why I was so grateful to find kundalini yoga, which somehow 'works' with my type of energy and movement. If you have tried yoga in the past and found it dull or uninspiring, try kundalini yoga, and especially, try RaviAna workouts.

This video has such a calming and natural pace to it. It moves through a lot of different movements, but none too long where I get overly restless. Ravi and Ana continue to discuss what area of the body each movement targets and improves, which is always very interesting to me, and I like the bit of non-denominational spirituality and depth added as well. It may take several times to get through the entire video without resting, but eventually you will and it feels like quite an accomplishment to do so. There are a lot of lengthening and flexibility exercises, exercises to strengthen your core and legs and I also very much like the SA-TA-NA-MA meditation at the very end as well.

Hopefully you will be as motivated as I am after doing these videos.

Highly recommended for anyone who wants a different and deeper type of workout.",1325808000,9,1628,4.622837370242214
2651668,5,B000I2JCAY,"Not much to say; I am a true Ana Brett and Ravi Singh Kundalini yoga fan and have been for about a year now. I started with the Fat Free Yoga and did it a few times a week for several months and just loved how I felt I really accomplished something significant after each workout. Pretty soon, I decided to try another one, and then another one, and then another one, and I think Yoga Beauty Body is about my 10th video from Ana and Ravi.

I'm 49 and very athletic, even though I have arthritis in my neck, lower back and hands, and these DVDs have significantly contributed to a lessening of chronic pain for me and greatly increased my flexibility. I'm now up to practicing yoga five times a week, and Yoga Beauty Body is in the regular rotation of videos. From beginning to end, I get lost in the workout, and it's over before I know it.

Additionally, nearly every video I purchase on Amazon.com arrives before the projected arrival date. By the end of this year, I fully intend to own every DVD by Ana and Ravi.",1325116800,9,1016,4.286458333333333

They don't always show you how to modify poses, so just be careful and don't overdo it.  The best part of the video is that you can customize your own workout using the ""matrix"" option, so if you don't have a lot of time, you can still squeeze in a little yoga.",1290297600,2,373,4.095890410958904

What I especially love about this workout:

**the clean, white set.  Ana does the exercises on a small mat, with small oval objects painted on the floor.  This reminds me of jelly beans and is a nice whimsical touch.

**meditation in rock pose (sitting on your knees, with hands folded on lap).  This pose is much more comfortable for me than sitting with my knees crossed.

**focus on breathing.  During lunge pose, Ana says ""pretend as though you're breathing through your eye balls.""  Okay, so it's an odd visual, but it really works!  I do focus more on my breathing.

**the gentle reminders.  For example, ""what happens on your yoga mat is a metaphor for real life.""  These may seem somewhat hokey, but they inspire me.

**the closing meditation.  This is especially relaxing.  You are lying on your stomach and touching each finger while saying ""sat nam.""  I am not yet able to just empty my mind and meditate; my mind keeps racing. So this meditation is perfect for me.

While there are a few advanced poses, like shoulder stand, modifications are discussed.  This workout is suitable for all fitness levels.

2651673,5,B000I2JCAY,"Yoga Beauty Body is one of my favourite Ana and Ravi Dvds.

The Dvd is filmed on a pure white set and the sound production is lovely.

The Class begins with a Tune in via a mantra and then moves into a warm up section, I really enjoy the warm up section as I feel that it prepares body and mind for what comes next. Then there is the kundalini yoga sets which are energising yet calming and include the 'magnificent 7' postures which are said to be beneficial for women and are good to do often, these include shoulderstand, plough, camel and stretch pose. I feel encouraged throughout with Ravi's commentary and if I open my eyes at any time I am inspired by Ana who demonstrates to the postures beautifully. There is a lovely 'Sa Ta Na Ma'meditation lying down on your front and then a final Tune out with a mantra. I feel so blissful and happy when I have worked with this DVD and have had comments that I look 'Radient'.

Ana and Ravi give good, clear instruction, information and demonstration throughout and there is encouragement from Ravi to keep you going.

I work within my limits on any given day.

2651674,5,B000I2JCAY,"Having recently been introduced to Ana Brett and Ravi Singh I can say, without hesitatation, that this video provides a full body workout.  What I really love about this husband and wife team is that they provide specific instructions for doing each exercise, pose or position.  For people who simply are unable to achieve the full exercise they provide alternatives that are still very effective, but less stressful for the body.  I can say that although I have been away from yoga for a long time, I can already achieve positions that I was unable to do when I first started.  You can actually feel your body lengthening and toning during each routine.  I love the fact that the couple spend time reminding you of the mental and physical results and provide meditation for reinforcement and mental well being.  They are absolutely the dynamic duo!

The poses are slightly more challenging compared to the 'fat free yoga' dvd but its still suitable for all levels and you do sweat. After practising with this dvd for 2 months I realised that my appetite has decreased and I don't crave for junk food anymore!!! I think the poses works on your internal organs and it sort of drives you into eating healthy. I've combined this workout with Leslie Sanson dvd and I was able to lose about seven kilos in 2 months.

I love hearing Ravi explain the benefits of each pose, which is motivating while you are holding a difficult pose.

Don't let the title fool you, the emphasis is on bringing out your INNER beauty. I'm not a yoga newbie but find this set just right, not too easy and not too hard.

I usually do the whole video, 45 min to an hour and feel awesome after I am finished, so refreshed and clear minded. I have thought of getting other Yoga DVD's but since this one has the matrix menu, there's no need. I can do the full DVD or choose exactly which segment I want to do. Also, Ana and Ravi do a good job on this one unlike other reviews I have read about their other yoga DVD's just a couple of corny remarks made but nothing crazy.

2651701,5,B000I2JCAY,"This DVD is my introduction to both Kundalini yoga, and the instruction of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh. I truly love this workout.

I have done a good deal of yoga in my life. I started with Hatha yoga classes many years ago, and most recently, I've been exploring Astanga. But for me, this yoga is something really special.

I have been doing Yoga Beauty Body for two weeks, and I am experiencing some truly remarkable effects. I am sleeping wonderfully, and I wake up rested and refreshed, I have noticed a marked improvement in the tone of the muscles all over my body, my skin is clear, taut and glowing (no premenstrual breakout), I have gentler PMS symptoms and my overall energy level is much improved. That's the physical stuff, but other benefits I am experiencing include: a calmer, more positive mindset and some real relief from depression symptoms I have been dealing with due to some rather severe life challenges. The stress in my life is pretty significant, but since starting this yoga, I am finding that I am weathering things with a lot more calm and positivity--it is helping me with the stress and depression so much, and I am very grateful.

I would absolutely recommend this workout, and I am looking forward to more from Ana and Ravi. I have also started working with Fat Free Yoga: Cleanse and Purify, and I am also enjoying that very much. I have just ordered Ultimate Stretch and the Power Navel workouts, and I am VERY excited to start those as well.

And as for the Kundalini ""buzz"" I've heard about, I do experience a fantastic, gentle, natural high or ""buzz"" from these workouts. Is is a wonderful feeling--this yoga just makes me feel better. I look forward to it every day.

My only caveat would be for absolute beginners. I am very fit, and have an extensive background in dance and a number of yoga classes. At this point, I am very comfortable with a home practice (in fact I prefer it in many ways), even with a new method as I am very intimate with my body athletically. I find these workouts doable, but with a nice challenge to them as well. If you are an absolute beginner you would be wise to proceed mindfully and with caution, and modify the exercises as needed. Ana's demonstration is flawless, the rhythm of her breathing is very clear and audible, especially with the Breath of Fire, and modifications for the postures, as well as a breath primer, are helpful too. Also, I think it is very important to approach this as a complete body, mind and spirit system of training. There is a lot going on here, and it goes well beyond the physical, although the benefits there are fantastic as well. Highly recommended.",1260835200,31,2655,4.581052631578947

This is really a well done workout and I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to add some spice and variety to their yoga workout.

When I received my first DVD, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond, I didn't know what to think of it. It was not the yoga I was used to and I set it aside for months. About 2-3 months ago, something told me I should give it another try. I'm so glad I did! Once I decided to be open to what they were teaching I couldn't believe the difference in my peace of mind and in my body! I find myself handling stress so much better and my body is becoming stronger and more flexible. I'm finding an inner calm and peace that I didn't have before and look forward to getting up in the morning to do this ""workout"" although it hardly feels like work.

I expanded my kundalini library to include Beauty Body, which is great, Journey through the Chakras and Fat Free yoga and have 4 more on the way! I'd recommend any of these workouts for both inner and outer beauty. Sat Nam.",1246579200,2,1009,4.201030927835052

I find that my back misses doing these exercise sets.  I feel the difference in my body the minute I finish.  They can be quite challenging, so please do them at the pace that is right for you each time you do them.

Not only is it an excellent workout (I come away feeling that good after-workout sore almost every time, always a good sign) and an all-around muscle toning workout, but it's also incredibly relaxing like all of Ravi & Ana's DVD's. I walk away feeling radiant and have more energy than I thought possible! I usually do this DVD after work as it eases all of my tensions from work away an puts me into a blissful state.

I have confidence that ANY DVD Ravi & Ana create is beyond amazing and can help in all areas of life. Yoga Beauty Body just seems to complete almost all aspects of trouble areas in our lives. Highly recommended!",1241136000,2,779,4.4475524475524475

I feel so free and confident, and radiant afterwards, like I can do anything.....I love the exercises. I love that shoulderstand with Breath of Fire is included. I have been told this is the very best yogic exercise for adrenal fatigue which I have suffered from often(from overextending myself at work and with family). I love the instruction. So inspirational, educational, and never new agey at all. I have 5 of their workouts now and I am amazed at how unique each is and the different gifts they offer.

These videos made me realize that its pilates I prefer becuase the spirituality of yoga can be a little too much for me.

The postures flow perfectly one to the other and just when you think you can't go on a light easy posture comes up and you can continue.  Beautifully balanced, the musice blends magnificently! Ana & Ravi are always encouraging and giving you incentives to go on.  I never stop until I make it thru the entire session so I can watch Ana dance and see those words ""you are beautiful"".

I love the way I feel now physically, mentally and emotionally.  I have bought several DVDs on Yoga, but this DVD is the best for me, because for an average body person like me can easily follow the workouts.  After practicing for a month, I can see my wife is in a very good shape and also in good mood. The yoga teachers were very well spoken, clear and precise in what they wanted to convey to the viewers. Ana and Ravi were great in teaching.  I would recommend this product to everyone who wanted to make a life style change on mind, body and beauty.

It does not get your heart rate up but it feels very pilates in terms of the way muscle groups are worked. There is not a single pose in the practice that I do not enjoy, especially some of the more difficult ones like shoulder stand and upward bow.  Both Ana and Brett narrate and the music flows well with the movement. My only beef with is the ""7 essential poses"" on the DVD menu is just a series of still pictures. I think they should have had a 12 minute (or so) working segment that just focused on a flow of these 7 poses with an explanation on why they are so important. Heck, all of their DVDs are spliced together, I think it would have been an easy addition. Other than that minor bit of pickiness, a winner.",1228521600,3,895,4.132183908045977

But what a sense of accomplishment to see my form improve as time goes on and I keep trying. I still can't do camel pose, but I get closer and close! What I've learned from them is patience. Patience to hang in there and hold poses as long as they do and patience in learning to do a pose. I am still working on the Magnificent 7 and it's been almost 2 years since I purchased my first  Ravi/Ana dvd.

Their unique kundalini exercises open up your mind AND body, the breathing really keeps you focused and in a meditative state.  I always feel so fantastic afterward and can actually feel my body vibrating the energy all day long.  I used to do yoga routines that made me feel like quitting halfway through, but Yoga Beauty Body is so much fun, I am sad when it ends.

What I love about their programs is the pacing, the music, their dialogue, and the fact that they always pick exercises which are effective and fun. I have tried many yoga classes around here including: hatha, power, ashtanga, bikram, and kundalini, etc., and nothing equals the experience I get when I do one of Ana & Ravi's  DVD's. I'm happy that I'm saving money by staying at home and doing my practice with their DVD's. Yoga Beauty Body is the perfect workout.

2651794,2,B000I2JCAY,"As noted by another reviewer, this video is not for beginners. One of the reasons is that it does not explain very well how to get into each pose or the proper pose form-Ana and Ravi just tell you to be careful. This is a bit problematic for people who have not done yoga before since proper pose form is very important for avoiding injury. They do not distinguish between the 'good' and the 'bad' pain of yoga and instead say things like (roughly quoted): we know this is hard but (yap yap yap, keep doing x, do it for your liver)....
While many of their words and directions are encouraging, at times Ravi sounds patronizing. This gets a bit annoying during a yoga workout, especially considering that Kundalini yoga is supposed to be especially empowering/useful for women.
The matrix is useful if you just want to do fifteen or twenty minutes of yoga, but there are not a lot of menu options to choose from, so in order to get an hour workout you have essentially one option. This dvd goes over seven poses of yoga, and focuses on each for a longer period of time, which allows you to build strength and endurance. This is the reason I gave it a two instead of a one. I will probably be returning it.

After one time using this video, it's the ony kind of yoga I want to do!  The video itself is challenging but relaxing, keeps you moving, and best of all, explains the benefits of what you are doing, which encourages you to keep at it if you feel like giving up.  I love the format - you just watch a woman moving steadily throughout the movements - not stopping to talk or explain anything - while voices instruct you and explain the movements. I also love the music.  After I finished the video, I felt so relaxed but powerful.  It left me feeling HAPPY and at peace.

I like the fact that it is a shorter routine than most of their other DVD's as well.

Cons: I'm a beginner at yoga, and this was my first attempt at kundalani yoga. Rather than holding just holding a pose, you're always moving in a certain position. Some of poses were way to difficult for a beginner, like the shoulder handstand. The video could have done without some cheesy parts, like Ana dancing. They make you do things that could be embarassing to do around other people, like chant and move your rib cage in a circle while sitting down.

Bottom line: I'll stick with my ""Yoga for Beginners by Barbara Benaugh"" for now, and save this DVD for when I'm alone in my apartment and feeling like getting a challenging workout.",1220054400,8,780,4.564285714285714

I've been able to do advanced yoga poses in my other yoga that I had dreamed of doing after doing Ravi and Ana's yoga. Doing this Kundalini yoga increased my flexibility(I was surprised, because the poses don't stretch you that far), but combined with the breath and deep-rooted emotional connections my muscles released and became very flexible. My mental focus increased amazingly too for yoga and for life and it gave me new strength in life as well. My body, mind, and spirit crave Ravi and Ana's yoga daily!

If I'm unable to do one of my Ana/Ravi DVDs one day, I definitely notice a difference in my overall mood for the day. Once you get into these yoga workouts, you'll be addicted.

I would have returned it after 5 minutes if I could have, but I tried to have an open mind and give it a chance. I am so glad I did. I love this video.  I still look forward to coming home and doing it everyday (for about a month I have been alternating B Body and Fat Free yoga for Weight Loss).  I always feel really good afterwards.

2651810,2,B000I2JCAY,"The production of this DVD is excellent.  That said, I feel compelled to warn Christian viewers that it will be offensive to them because of its focus on Eastern mysticism and praying/chanting words to call on ""your higher self.""  You practice breathing exercises by chanting certain words (""sat"" and ""nam"").  This is Hinduism, pure and simple.  Don't go there.

I highly recommend you google ""Christian yoga"" and choose one of those videos.  Read this website for more info about what you might be getting into before you venture into yoga, like I did:  [...]

2651812,5,B000I2JCAY,"I bought Ana & Ravi's Yoga Beauty Body about a year ago.  I had been doing ashtanga yoga or about a year prior to that, but I was tired of doing sun salutations all the time.  I have YBB, Dance the Chakras, and Yoga Bliss Hips.  I love them all, but I keep going back to Yoga Beauty Body.  It's very complete and works the whole body in just under an hour.  I feel calm, strong, and happy every time I do it.  It's fun, and I actually WANT to do it every day. I LOVE the breath of fire!  I always tell people that doing this workout makes me feel a ""buzz"" or tingling sensation.  It's a yoga high!

More generally, yoga with Ana & Ravi is a mental as well as physical workout.  Kundalini has helped me not only to reshape my body but also to redefine my relationship with food and myself, and as a result I've lost 40 pounds since I first purchased Yoga Beauty Body.  I'm now much more aware of how different foods make me feel, and I'm also more aware of how much and what I need to eat.  American society teaches women to dislike their bodies and have an adversarial relationship with themselves and with food, which I believe is what caused me to become overweight in the first place.  Well, kundalini with Ana & Ravi has helped me to work through those feelings and accept myself just as I am-once I did that, the weight came off.  Sounds corny, I know, but it's the absolute truth.  I have more self confidence than I've ever had at any point in my life, and doing this yoga is at the root of this change.  Kundalini with Ana & Ravi can be very powerful in helping you to improve your mind as well as your body and make the changes in your life that you need to make.

I highly recommend YBB and all of Ana & Ravi's DVDs.  Kundalini with Ana & Ravia is amazing and I couldn't imagine a day without it!",1194825600,86,1806,4.111428571428571

2651839,5,B000I2JCAY,"Dance the Chakras has all the great features of the other Ana and Ravi DVD's I have and more. I can do most of the moves, and the class just flows, in spite of my scoliosis and other challenges. I feel the exercises are in a natural progression; therefore, I feel I am doing what comes naturally. The DVD is one hour, not too much.

The transitions/relaxations/meditations in between exercises are both welcome, and therapeutic. I am very impatient, and I thought I would resist succumbing to some long relaxations/meditations.

One of my favorite exercises is in the beginning when we bring our heels to the insides of our legs repeatedly, breathing with the rhythm, pulling in our feet, keeping the heels a bit away from the thighs.

I have difficulty with some physical exercise; I do not have a whole lot of energy, I am not very limber, and I have a curvature of the spine. Fortunately for me, as I began with Ana and Ravi's Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond around 9 months ago (virtually out of shape), I enjoy breath of fire, and have a capacity for most of the exercises in these DVD's.

I like the shoulder stand. It is not too risky for me to do that, and even to put my legs parallel. I have bone density issues and take the safe route. I adapt to most exercises in my own way, with the tips on the DVD, and still get a great workout. Ana and Ravi challenge me, yet do not push me without a cushion to fall back on.

I am 52 years old. If I can do it, I am sure a lot of people can. When the workout calls for me to lean all the way back and put my hands on my heels (camel pose?), I simply lift and stretch my neck back as far as I can while holding it still, lifting my chest, and holding my hands behind my upper hips. I still feel the workout. The breathing really stimulates me.

I always make sure I do the spinal exercises. As a whole, these DVD's help my back, but the fluidity of the spinal exercises make me aware that I am loosening up inside.

A great deal of emphasis is put on the glands and other organs in the body. I like when I know what I am working on when I am working it, and why.

The exercises are all good for the core! All of the DVD's have great tummy exercises.

This is not traditional Hatha yoga. The moves are just as strengthening and lengthening, though, and quite aerobic for me. I prefer this Kundalini Yoga because of the breathing, and the Chakra work. Also, the moves are more sensual. It is quite easy to get a good picture of what the Chakras mean when I do these DVD's.

The dancing, particularly the victory dance in Dance the Chakras is very feminine, and very empowering. I am really working! Great that I do not have to master the dances.

I wouldn't be doing Ana and Ravi justice without saying how beautiful Ana, the moves, the music and sound effects, the settings, the prose, and both their voices are. Still not doing justice. They both give inspiration and direction via voiceover, and you can even hear the correct breathing techniques, including long, deep breathing.

My favorites are, in order: Yoga Beauty Body, the new updated Fat Free Yoga, Dance the Chakras, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond, The first set of Journey through the Chakras, the Ultimate Stretch Workout, and Navel Power.

I have not tried all of them, or the newest DVD's, but I can tell you that I will definitely try more of them.

8143362,5,B000I2JCAY,"I have been enjoying Ravi and Ana's DVDs for about 15 years now and this still stands as one of my all-time favorites. I am also a Kundalini yoga instructor but really do enjoy following a class in doing my own practice at home, so I have around 40 or 50 DVDs just for Kundalini alone.

First, please understand that this is VERY different from the types of yoga most people are familiar with. You will not be expected to assume any pretzel-like stretches and the work is done almost entirely with the eyes closed and on the ground. That being said, you can still work hard and very deeply throughout this set. Kundalini often relies on a type of breathing called Breath of Fire, which is usually learned by first panting over an extended tongue and then continuing while closing the mouth and breathing that way through the nose. The reason this breath is used, to simplify it, is to accelerate the benefits of the posture being assumed. It is said that one minute of a pose with Breath of Fire accomplishes what would take up to an hour with normal breathing. It takes getting used to but once you do the rewards are great, as it energizes, oxygenates the body and cleanses the blood and lungs.

This specific set includes what Yogi Bhajan called ""The Magnificent Seven"" postures, meaning seven poses he felt were crucial to do on a daily basis, especially for women. Among these poses are Rock, Bow, Camel, Locust, Stretch, Shoulderstand and Sat Kriya. The set is about 50 minutes long and includes a lot of other poses but these are considered the stars of the show on this DVD.

There is a lovely breath primer in the beginning, for people new to Breath of Fire, which will allow you time to practice but can also be skipped if you want to jump right in and know how to do it (it's a chapter unto itself so is easy to skip past).

As was the custom when this was made/released, Ana demonstrates and most of the verbal instruction is done by her husband and longtime Kundalini teacher, Ravi Singh. Ravi was one of the original devotees to this unique form of yoga when Yogi B first brought this technology to the USA, which was in the late 60s, so he has been doing this for decades and has a lovely, gentle, poetic way of guiding you through each posture.

Kundalini yoga poses usually involve movement, rather than holding static postures, for the most part, and that increases the meditative element as well. The best thing to do if this is completely new to you is to view this all the way through one time before beginning your journey (as you really should with all yoga DVDs).

Here is the order of postures, with some suggestions for modifications:

Tune In - This is a traditional, non-religious chant meant to connect you to your higher self or spirit. What they literally chant, 3 times, is ""Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo"". What that translates to, generally, is calling upon the teacher within to guide you.
Breath Primer - As mentioned above, this allows you to practice Breath of Fire and long, slow, deep breathing. It can be skipped if you are already comfortable with both.
Warm Ups
Sufi grinds - If you find it uncomfortable to sit cross-legged, you can sit on your heels or sit on a stool, chair or the edge of the bed if your feet are flat on the ground.
Alternating back of the leg stretches - you can do this as slowly as your like, just keep the breath and movement linked. You can also simply hold the position of one leg bent and the other extended and breath in that static position, switching legs halfway through, if the movement back and forth is difficult for you. The point is gentle but deep stretching in the backs of the legs.
Baby pose - this one can be very uncomfortable for some people, I know. You can open up the knees to allow a space to melt into when you bend forward, and/or you can place a pillow for your head to rest on (or a soft block if you prefer). The neck and shoulders can and should feel a bit warm in this, as it is stimulating the glands in that area. Never work through pain, but know that sometimes a lot of sensation means energy is moving and blocks are clearing.  If sitting on your heels is uncomfortable, you can do this seated, bending forward enough to access the same basic shape.
Lunge Position - this is a very deep, long-held pose to release the hip flexors and psoas, which is a crucial thing we should all do every say to counteract the negative effects of sitting or standing on hard surfaces. That being said, you can do these next to a table, couch or bed and use that surface to give you stability and if the leg in back feels uncomfortable at the knee you can place a folded blanket or pillow underneath. I even did this on my bed when I hurt my knee and it was too sore to handle even a soft mat on the floor.
Reclining Pose - Ok, this one is a doozie if you are new or have knee issues but not to fear, because this is actually meant to help to heal those issues. Ways to modify are myriad; you can place a pillow between your feet and butt and simply recline back onto your hands behind you a little bit. What you are going for here is a nice stretch across the tops of the thighs (quadriceps) without strain anywhere. This modification is how I started doing this one and it still works wonders. Again, you can do this on your bed for a softer surface under your knees and as you feel yourself loosening up simply walk the hands back a little bit more each time. Don't panic! Worst case scenario, anything which results in pain or is just not possible can be skipped and in that case you can do a preceding pose longer, if you like.
Parallel Squat - If your knees feel it a bit too much, lessen the depth by sticking your tookus up a bit more, or do this in front of a bed or table and put your arms outstretched across that surface for support. The focus here is on activating the leg muscles so make whatever accommodations you need to do this safely.
Rocking in Butterfly - yeah, this one can seem much harder than it really is, but you can also simply sit in butterfly with long, deep breathing for the duration. If you are doing the rock, I find that inhaling while upright, exhaling when rocking back, inhaling upright, then exhaling as you fold forward works for me. In teacher's training we found that there were a few ways to coordinate the breath with this movement and it boiled down to whatever made you feel comfortable and relaxed. It should be fun and get easier as you do it longer.
Bridge Pose - this is a classic, done in pretty much all yoga forms, but Kundalini has you move up and down in sync with the breath. I like to do this in bed upon waking, it feels amazing and gets the blood flowing gently. If you cannot hold your ankles, simply have your hands flat on the bed or floor next to you.
Rock and Roll on the Spine - this is done in between postures in many Kundalini sets. I find it feels like a massage and it really shakes me out of a funk or bad mood if I get down and do this for a minute or two, it just gets things flowing again and puts you back into your body, if you tend to get caught up in thoughts or worries. Breathe however it feels best to you and hold your knees over or under, as they say. Please be careful about doing this on a hard surface.
Locust Pose - this one has never been my favorite and it feels really awkward in the beginning. Honestly, what you can substitute for a similar benefit if this just doesn't feel right for you is to lie on your stomach, rest your chin on the floor on your hands and lift one leg up behind you, straight, at a time in sync with the breath (inhale up, exhale down, then switch) or hold one up for half of the duration while breathing long, slow and deep, then switch. I have used this modification often but I do Locust as taught here whenever I can.
Bow Pose - this is an old favorite of mine but I know how challenging this can be so bear with me here for some ways to approach this if you are new or just stiff. You can wrap a towel, scarf or yoga strap (if you're fancy) around your ankles and reach back to hold that, rather than your ankles, if that is too deep of a back bend for you. You can also simply bend your knees until the legs are perpendicular over the butt and clasp your hands behind your back to lift your front body. If you can do this with one leg at a time but not both yet, holding one ankle while the other leg is extended, just embrace that and switch halfway through. Be sure you have enough padding underneath you so there is no discomfort around the pubic bone or hip bones.
Stretch Pose - ah, my least favorite, but naturally the one I need the most (drat!). You can modify this a few ways; do one leg at a time with the other leg bent/foot flat on the ground, and switch halfway through. You can reach with one hand and hold your head with the other, if the neck bothers your, or support your head with both hands but then definitely do one leg at a time so you don't hurt your lower back.
Leg Extensions - a continuation on the Stretch Pose work, letting your head rest on the floor and feel free to extend one leg at a time, alternating, or extend them up into the air a bit more but the idea is to energize your core muscles without taxing the lower back.
Tricep Raises - this is done on the stomach with the chin on the floor. If you are larger-chested this can feel awkward, so you can rest your chin on a book, block or small pillow.
Arm Circles - ooh these can cook your shoulders, no doubt, but that's a good thing. Again, you can do this seated if cross-legged sitting is not an option.
Camel Pose - Ana demonstrates several ways to modify this one, as it is very deep and you should begin with one of the modifications if you are new to this or have back issues, but this can also help to heal that over time if done safely and gently. You can ditch Breath of Fire here if it's too much and add that in later on.
Guru Pranam (seated forward prayer) - this is meant to be deeply relaxing, but if you cannot sit on your heels, try sitting on a chair or stool which is equal height to your bed and lean forward onto that with the knees wide. This is a treat so you don't want to miss it.
Shoulderstand - definitely not for everyone, period. But you can modify this, as many Hatha teachers do, by substituting with your legs up a wall so you can relax onto the floor with the legs up against that surface. Again, this is a restorative posture so do whichever version you can, safely.
Wide Legged Cobra - if your back is really tight, simply walk your hands further forward, allowing you to come up into a straight arm without too deep of a back bend, or come up only half way each time. You want a front body stretch, if possible, when upright in this posture but sometimes that can take a while to access if your back is tight. Do this regularly and that will open up over time, and it's great for the kidneys and adrenals.
Sat Kriya - this can feel pretty weird for someone not used to Kundalini or chanting out loud. The chant here, Sat Nam, translates roughly to ""truth is my name"" or ""I am truth"" and it will likely feel awkward at first but stick with it and do it seated in a chair or on a stool or bed if need be. Just focus on the tightening of the lower muscles upon chanting ""Sat"".
Sa Ta Na Ma Meditation - as you are doing this on your stomach in the same position as the Tricep Raises, the same modification applies if you find this feels awkward due to your chest lifting you off the floor too much to rest your chin down comfortably. You can also do this one on your bed, and I honestly find this to be deeply relaxing no matter how or where I do it.
The closing chant is done one time, not 3 like the opening, and is a simple ""Sat Nam"" held a bit longer. I like to imagine the tone of Sat originating at the root chakra and moving up through the stomach, heart, throat, forehead and up to the crown of the head. Visualizations are a big part of Kundalini so have fun with that element.

I hope these suggestions help and give you an idea of what to expect and how to wrap this set around your own body and needs. And by the way, that is how ALL yoga is meant to be! Whether you are doing Ashtanga or Yin Yoga or Kundalini, the poses are meant to conform to your body, not the other way around. There is almost always a way to do that but sometimes you just need to skip a pose and do another in its place, that really is ok. I have been a student of yoga for 30 years and a teacher for 15, I have seen it all. This style can definitely throw people used to other forms or who are used to yoga sets which are more seemingly physical, but it is powerful and very meditative and effective, it just works with meridians and chakras and energy, much the way acupuncture and chiropractic sessions do. I feel that Kundalini yoga uses breath, movement, mantra and sometimes mudra (hand positions) to send waves of energy through the body as if we were living gongs being struck gently.

There are so many Kundalini sets, with such varied intentions and focal points but this one is a personal favorite because it covers so many things I need on a daily basis. Ravi and Ana present this in a fun, sometimes playful and always loving way so it is a joy to come back to again and again. I hope you enjoy this set as much as I do!

8143363,5,B000I2JCAY,"As with most of Ravi Ana's DVDs - this is another amazing workout.  I used this in the past and it helped me melt off 20 lbs effortlessly. Lately I just hadn't been very focused on my yoga practice and was feeling just plain blah - couple that with my labworks showing my thyroid being very erratic - TSH would be extremely low or jump very high - and even in working with my doctor trying to get the medication to stabilize my thyroid and other hormones - they were just all over the place.  HOWEVER, Ravi/Ana's DVDs have helped stabilize all my hormones - Dr can't believe that it is this yoga that has made such a profound difference!!  I should also note, that when  you first start with these workouts - you might not want to continue with certain poses - this is actually a sign that whatever is off in your body is being worked on and needs to be worked on so, bear with it.  After the session, it is very subtle but, then again maybe not, because you'll realize ""OMG I feel sooo good"".  I now make it a point to do one of their DVDs every day (like I used to do!!).  Some of the workouts (on this and their other DVDs are less than 15 minutes).  Just do it and reap the rewards - it is now one of my favorite things to do - I just love it so much and my skin, health, mental outlook show it.
