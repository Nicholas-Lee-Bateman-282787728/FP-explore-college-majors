2511724,4,B000E991A2,"I'm writing this in advance of the release of the DVDs, so be advised this is a review of the series and not the actual DVD release.  I have seen the show recently on old VHS tapes I recorded off of the Sci-Fi Channel and was surprised at how good the writing is.  The show takes bits and pieces from all of the Apes project before it.  From the book, it retains the 4 characters that were in the movie series: Zira, Cornelius, Nova, and Doctor Zaius.  This Planet of the Apes also resembles the planet Soror in Boulle's novel in that the apes have 20th century technology.  The only area that's lacking, in the beginning, is the power to fly.  From the movies, they took the Forbidden Zone, they reworked the mutants, an older Brent, and Austin Stoker (McDonald from Battle) plays the astronaut, Jeff. Urko and the fugitive format are borrowed from the CBS TV series.

The basic story in the 2 part opener is very familiar by now.  Three astronauts land on the planet and are shocked to find that they are captured by apes.  Zira and Cornelius aid them in their escape.

The animation is awful.  The panaramic style of the illustrators almost makes up for this, however.  Intricate scenes are painted onto backgrounds.  As the camera pans these scenes, one may forget for a time that they are making up for shortcomings in the budget.  For this reason, I could not give it 5 stars.

The stories are imaginiative and serialized.  I was drawn in by the power struggle between Zaius and Urko.  True, there are a few turkeys.  I could have done without the giant mountain ape, but overall it was light years above the ordinary Saturday morning fare of the 70s.  I certainly would not recommend this to those who have not seen all 5 movies, and the live-action TV show. To those who are hungry for more ""Apes"", this series fits the bill.",1138147200,32,1833,4.483383685800605

2511729,5,B000E991A2,This is an animated series and does not relate to the movies or the live action TV show.  It does have a few ties to the movie with Nova helping the astronauts.  This series has two astronauts trying to stay away from the ape city and find a way to live in the society run by the apes.  This is a great escape from what is possible and shows a society that is not run by humans and how animals can rule.,1470873600,4,403,3.8902439024390243
2511730,4,B000E991A2,"""RETURN TO THE PLANET OF THE APES"" was a 1975 NBC Saturday morning cartoon series,loosely based on the Twentieth Century Fox Franchise that began in 1968! produced and animated by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises,the famed studio behind United Artists' ''THE PINK PANTHER"" animated shorts,this well written cartoon version was highly inteligent and entertaining! but the main person behind this animated series
was Doug Wildey,the creator of Hanna-Barbera's ""JONNY QUEST"" series in 1964,who was the supervising producer of this 1975 series,and the main character designer,which was classic Wildey,who also drew professionally as a comicbook illustrator,and was extremely good at his art! the show was a basic re-telling of how three astronaunts in outer space went through a dimensional warp,landing them on an Earth dominated by inteligent simians,who consider ""Humanoids"" as the lower form of life! the animated version stayed as close to the movie characters as they could,and the voice cast was also well noted,using Hanna-Barbera voice veteran Henry Corden (""THE FLINTSTONES"") and actress Claudette Nevins,who voiced most of the main female characters (""Judy Franklin"" and ""Nova"") in this series! ironically,the animated series was the second version of the ""APES"" TV attempt,as CBS in Fall 1974 had aired the live action series,also called ""PLANET OF THE APES"",starring Roddy McDowell,but the series was a ratings disaster,and was canceled in January 1975,which was a costly failure for CBS,before DePatie-Freleng took their cue to animate the franchise for NBC,even some years before,when the studio did an animated ""DOCTOR DOOLITTLE"" in Fall 1970,which was also based on a FOX property! though it isn't related to the 1975 series,the CBS series did use some interesting people-the story editors on the 1974 series was Joe Ruby & Ken Spears,who some four years later,went on to form an animation studio called Ruby-Spears,which later became a sister studio to Hanna-Barbera,when the two studios were owned by Taft Broadcasting in the 80s! for all its great intentions,""RETURN TO THE PLANET OF THE APES"" was a one season only series,and vanished afterwords! this 2006 DVD release was officially the first time it was circulated,since NBC last aired the series. i'd recommend this DVD to serious fans of the classic ""PLANET OF THE APES"" franchise,who'll value and appreciate this version,with greater nostalgia and value,and also for animation fans of 70s Saturday morning TV,who remember this show!",1469404800,,2499,5.544502617801047
2511731,2,B000E991A2,"Expected much more out of this, but it is just basically a cartoon for kids...the visuals aren't great and the dialogue is worse.

you must have loved it when they made the Planet of Apes movie into a cartoon which i did and still do. I waited for years for this and have
had since released and still watching them over and over. The stories like the TV show in 74 were more about the stories than the action but
that doesn't take away from how good they were and are. Oh yeah the same negative comments ""the animation is boring"" ""the writing is not
exciting"" blah blah blah....i say to those go back and watch your over produced CGI cartoons and movies with no story or acting and nothing
but special effects and action that you can't even see at times and nothing but blood and gore and sex. This was real cartoon making!",1456099200,,829,4.253164556962025

2511737,2,B000E991A2,"This Saturday morning cartoon from the early 70s is like a diet version of the movies. Most of the same characters from the movie series (i.e. Dr. Zaius,  Cornelius and Zira, Gen. Urko, even Brent and Nova) are featured, and the series follows most of the same plot lines (i. e. war between apes and mutants).; however, one key element is missing, and that's the sharp satire of the films. All that's left is an action adventure version of Planet of the Apes - although this take on the story doesn't sink to the depths of the 2001 Tim Burton remake.  The animation is typical of 70s cartoons: lots of repetitive, jerky motion against static backgrounds, similar to Scooby Doo or Jonny Quest. One thing the series does well, which is uncharacteristic of animated series of the era, is tell a continuous story with events carrying over from episode to episode. Overall, the series feels less like the classic film series and more like a young adult novelization of the films.",1437696000,,974,4.690058479532164

2511748,5,B000E991A2,"This series, made by the same people who produced the Star Trek animated series, is nostagic fun.  The art and animation are reminiscent of comic book art rather than the style that was popular in that day.  If you liked the original Johnny Quest, this is worth a look, as stylistically they have a lot of commonality.  The copies are good in this boxed set, there are no extras about the series included.  Episodes are presented in the correct chronilogical order, which for some reason had gotten jumbled when they had been originally broadcast.

This vision of the a future where Apes are the dominant series and humans considered to be dangerous parasitic animals doesn't have all the bite or horror of the original movie series.  I did very much like the world the authors created where the apes have 1960s style technology but still haven't mastered flight and don't stray very far from their capitol city.  There are dumb humans and mutants as in the original movies, but the mutants here are less malignant; instead of worshipping a doomsday bomb they are waiting for a female savior to lead them to restatblishing human dominance of earth.  It was sad that the series didn't have a longer run as many of the themes were not fully developed,  but it does have an ending of sorts that offered hope that peace between human and ape may still be possible.  That having been said the series isn't without faults; for instance the human pack escapiing the slavery of the ape world conspicuously lack children--you can't have an ongoing civilizaiton with replacements being born--perhaps the writers were affraid that children would have made the stories too scary for the intended Saturday morning cartoon's intended audience.  They don't shy away from certain apes calling for the total genocide of the human race as a whole though.  Like the Star Trek animated series though, I think the writers did have in mind the possibility that adults would be watching these too--so they really aren't dumbed down.  The animation is slow, and some sequences are too drawn out--but overall the quality of the artwork overall makes up for these shortcomings.

With new remakes of the movie series, these are definitely worth a 2nd look whether you grew upu with them or want another spin on a familiar story.",1410825600,5,2301,4.836734693877551

2511760,5,B000E991A2,"The animation of this series is about what you'd expect for mid-1970's Saturday Morning kid's fare.  Still, the details, color, and scenary make up for it.  What really elevates this short single-season run are the episodes and the overall story line.  In some ways, this kid's cartoon is actually more true to the original book by Pierre Boulle and actually contains some fairly complicated and in-depth story lines.  It would appeal to the fairly young, but is probably aimed at older kids, teens, and certain adults who appreciate it.  When I compare this cartoon to the original TV series (with Ron Harper, etc) I gotta admit it's a toss-up as to which I enjoy better.  Any Planet of the Apes fan absolutely MUST own this DVD....do not assume that it's too juvenile in nature (think Star Trek animated series and it's amazing complexity and story lines) and make this part of your POTA collection!  I have enjoyed the DVD and am planning to watch it again, which is more than I can say about other Saturday morning programs from my childhood.  GET IT!",1357776000,2,1055,4.726775956284153

This cartoon is AWESOME!!  The Apes in this show match up more closely with Pierre Boulles original vision but then throw in the mutant human beings from ""Beneath"" and giant monsters (in two episodes only) and ou have got the making of a great sci-fi adventure cartoon series.  The animation is very...nostalgic for this time period but that only adds to the charm of the show for me.

Listen for Henry Corden who plays General Urko whom some of you may remember as the voice of Fred Flintstone in the late 70's.

2511765,3,B000E991A2,"Despite all the negatives I read in other reviews I bought this, because I love visiting that upside down world of Apes.  I was not surprised by the terrible animation, dialogue, and scripting.  What did surprise me, was that the opening title sequence was the best part of the show. Now there was some awesome art work, splicing, and music!  They should have made the whole show like that! That would have been rad.  Sadly this show goes nowhere for the first 9 episodes, and it does so slowly.  Not until the last few episodes does it get really good, and then it leaves you hanging because it was canceled. For the die hard fan only.",1318809600,4,636,4.448275862068965
2511766,5,B000E991A2,"Being an Ape fan from my childhood, I purchased the ultimate collection when it first came out.  I was pleased to go back and watch all the films, the TV series and the animated series.  The audio/video quality of the animated series in the Ultimate Collection was really lacking.  There was hardly any color palette, other than oranges and browns, and it was botched by tons of dust, scratches, and artifacts.  The sound was muddled mono track with pops and hisses.  After years of holding out, I finally broke down and took a chance on double dipping on the remastered animated series.  I popped in the original from the Ultimate Collection, just so I could have a fresh image by which to compare and contrast.  The newer release loads with the same menu design, so no real differences yet.  Once I pushed play on episode one, IMMEDIATELY, my mouth fell open as the differences were glaring right before me.  Colors and details that were not visible in the Ultimate Collection were now presented to my wondering eyes.  I couldn't believe how crisp and clear the images were.  I popped in the old one again just to see it, and was dumbfounded at the stark differences between the two version.  You can now see every brush stroke and pencil line in the animated cells,  Contrast that with the original where everything was blurry and there seemed as if someone had overlaid the whole image with a dark filter.  The audio is still mono, but it too has been cleaned up.  There are still a few examples of some specks here and there, but this is the absolute best I've ever seen this.  Another annoying aspect of the original release was that the whole screen seemed unstable, as it would wiggle and shake.  This is especially noticeable in the opening titles.  That has been corrected, and now you have a stable image without the annoying jiggling.  Fox is truly to be commended for doing such a great job at cleaning up this series that is a fond memory from my childhood.  Of course, since we only had a black and white TV at the time, it is truly a treat to see this series in all its colorful glory.  If you have the Ultimate Collection, you owe it to yourself to spend a little money and get this newly remastered edition.  You won't be sorry.",1312156800,5,2246,4.521091811414392
2511767,5,B000E991A2,"I am a huge fan of the original movies and bought the Animated series last year and it brings back so many memories as a kid watching it every Saturday morning on CBS while eating ""Freakies"" cereal as well as other brands..I never realized that General Urko had the same voice as Fred Flintstone.. I laughed my butt off when I heard his voice but I actually don't remember that as a kid..The amimation was so much different than what it is now but you have to give them credit on the watercolors and drawings but what do you expect from being about 36 years old..I have enjoyed every single episode and before buying it I watched some of the series on YouTube..The only sad part about it is that it should have run for at least another season.. I would have loved to have seen Judy, Bill and Jeff make it home, even Brent.. I was a bit disappointed on how it actually ended though with Cornelius and Jeff in that hot air balloon with book in hand to show the Apes that humanoids ruled the earth first..It actually boggles my mind why something like that had to happen but it did and there isn't anything that any of us can do about it.. I love it still the same and I give it 5 stars all the way around..I loved the fact that the Apes called them humanoids instead of humans..Also all of the modern things like T.V'S and Radio's etc..I am just so happy that the series was put on DVD I never expected to ever see it again after so many years..Now that I have I will cherish the set forever but now I need to go out and buy the Star Trek Animated series as well..

2511769,4,B000E991A2,"I wasn't alive during the Planet of the apes boom, but have always been a huge fan of the ""universe"" since my father showed me it as a kid. I loved all the films, minus the second which was just decent and my least favorite. The TV series was excellent but lacked any resolve in the end for the viewers, and the remake was OK but could have been much darker and better than the Marky Mark stuff that was put out lol. This cartoon reminded me most of the television show, where the team has to accomplish a new mission each episode and jump a hurdle so to speak. I see the issues of the animation being kind of weird or sloppy or re-used. However what do you expect from a 35 year old cartoon series? I will however say that the way the camera moves to show dramatic effect on the cartoons is pretty cool and I have never seen a cartoon filmed in that manner before. It brings a dramatic feel and has some techniques used that they normally do only during live action films, so I enjoyed that. The characters were good and interesting yet lacked certain emotion when they spoke on occasion. The time line also doesn't add up to the other films/show but I try not to nit pick things too badly when we are talking about time warping and apes ruling the world =)

If you love classic cartoons or the apes movies this will be up your alley. If you like anime or fast action then I would most likely tell you not to buy this. On a side note there really isn't an ending, just like the TV series. The last episode doesn't tie up what happens to the team and any of the characters. I enjoyed it being a fan of the movies and such, and would recommend it for the person who wants all the apes DVDs, or just likes old school stuff.",1293667200,,1721,4.152694610778443

2511772,5,B000E991A2,"Return to the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic animated reworking of the live action movie/television series. It's good to see the breadth of ideas that come when a live action budget is not an issue. Although the animation is simple, the art work is detailed and interesting. Inclusion of General Urko from the TV series amongst ape characters like Cornelius and Zira from the movies is a nice touch. Despite being a continuity nightmare when placed alongside the rest of the franchise, it is trumps when it comes to being evolutions nightmare. It's also more faithful to the original novel's vision of an Ape Planet than it's predecessors.",1240790400,,642,4.845454545454546

I love 70s cartoons and am a fan of the original Planet of the Apes movies.  The story line is kind of mixed up, but if you disassociate this story line from the original movies you should have no problem enjoying the plot.",1240012800,2,380,4.25
2511774,4,B000E991A2,"The Planet of the Apes franchise was quite a hit in the 1970's and this animated series is a product of that. It does not stick strictly with the canon of the original series of movies, instead it creates its own story line. That said, the story is quite good and continues from episode to episode.

This series suffers from a low budget and it shows in the need to repeat some of the same footage over again to tell the story. It also was created in a time when all animation was done by hand and computer generated motion was still about 10 years away. Unfortunately, the series was cut off in its prime and so only made for about 1 and a half seasons.

This little known series was under the direction of the famed Doug Wildey (who created Johnny Quest)and his influence is unmistakable. The character art and the background art are excellent. The voice acting is good and the story is very captivating. Its worth the low price for a few evenings of flashback entertainment.",1239494400,,977,4.4525139664804465
2511775,4,B000E991A2,"Animated Planet of the Apes is- I have to be honest- pretty terribly animated, awkwardly voice-acted, and has a plot that is as slow as Pluto's journey around the sun. But I get a kick out of it because it is so ridiculous that it comes back around to awesome. Only for people with a high tolerance of schlock and ham. If you're on the fence about whether or not to get it, check out the Star Trek Animated Series first, which may inform your decision better.",1224028800,,459,4.287356321839081

2511777,2,B000E991A2,"I bought this two years ago, and so far have only watched three episodes.  Despite the potential for some good stories, the show doesn't really hold my interest.  The abysmal quality of mid-70s TV animation doesn't help, as everything is very stiff and static, and certain shots are repeated again and again.

The cost of animation was skyrocketing in the 1970s, and with a limited budget there was not much the producers could do.  When computers began to take over in the late 80s, animation could once again delight and amaze, but this only emphasizes the stodgy quality of 70s cartoons.

The live action series was much more interesting and enjoyable.  As a POTA enthusiast, I suppose I should give the cartoon another try, but it's just not compelling viewing.  I'd recommend this only for hard-core fans of the films.",1218758400,3,823,4.835714285714285
2511778,4,B000E991A2,"Yes, the animation is horrible.  Not a lot of movement, a lot of repetition, a lot of looooonnnnnnng establishing shots.  BUT...the artwork is wonderful.  Think of it as watching a comic book or graphic novel.  Suddenly it gets a lot better.
The voicework is terrible.  Except for Urko.
The stories aren't too bad at all, not a lot of dumbing down for the kiddies.  Some of the decisions our heroes make are rather stupid, but overall the stories are fairly well done.
Do not expect much carryover from the movies, except for some characters' names.  This series is closer to the Pierre Boulle novel in terms of the ape technology, (ie: vehicles, planes) and does not follow the film 'canon'.
I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this series that I last saw as a child.  I just wish it had an ending.",1218153600,5,795,4.628571428571429
2511779,4,B000E991A2,"This is a great relic of the early 1970's, it gets panned for it's basic animation style, very much like the early animated Star Trek cartoon of  similar time period. For the Planet of the Apes completist you must have this as it is a "" Apes"" and cartoon collectors gem, for the curious it is a great example of early 1970's cartoon sci-fi, and for the high octane ADHD X-Box generation who expect to view everything like film never existed and all must be HD Blue-Ray to be watchable then the eclectic value here might escape them.",1213833600,3,532,4.428571428571429
2511780,4,B000E991A2,"This was one of my favorites when I was a kid.  In retrospect there are a couple of things that kind of detract from the show.  The way the apes referred to the people as humanoids instead of humans like in the movies was one.  The only other complaint is that the animation was a little slow.  However, the art, especially the backgrounds, were fantastic.  The stories were very good as well.  I think that the music was underrated as well.  It was very effective in establishing an eerie mood to the show.  I wish that this show would have at least made it to a second season.  I would have liked to see where the writers were going.  Its a shame that cartoons weren't as well regarded as they are today.  I would have also like to have seen special features with this DVD.",1208217600,3,775,4.275862068965517

Had heroic characters, exciting story lines and fantastic plots, with no cutesy side kicks or foolish stories.

2511783,5,B000E991A2,"Well the animation in this movie is dated.  No super CGI effects or flashy catchy effects.  But the animation has one thing that most cartoons today lack.  that being true artwork.  The show is done in beautiful watercolors that make the show worth watching.  Similar to journey to the center of the Eart or Fantastic Voyage (CMDF) the animation is wholesome and smooth.

The plot developes with each episode.  Unlike cartoons of the eighties, which were single episodes that did not build on each other, this show does.  It is similar to B-5 in the way each episode builds and influences each other.

The writting is not dumbed down and all in all this is a good show fit for both adults and kids.  If you are a fan of the planet of the apes franchise, well you will not be disapointed.

Live Well:

2511786,2,B000E991A2,"DePatie-Freleng, the people behind the Pink Panther toons, take us on a final journey to the Planet of the Apes.  This obscure 1975 animated series was the last gasp of 'Apemania', that uniquely 70s phenomena spawned by the runaway success of the Planet Of The Apes franchise.  Following the failure of the underrated 1974 live action series, Return To The Planet Of The Apes wisely chooses not to repeat what has gone before, and breaks new ground. Pierre Boulle's original novel ""The Monkey Planet"" is the basis for this series, in which the Apes employ modern technology to make the lives of our three heroes difficult.  Let's not avoid the big issues here, folks - the animation is utterly terrible, the plots lack any kind of logic, Ron Brent refuses to put on clothes, and the human characters are as wooden as Noah's Ark - but there's a strange sort of 'Ed Wood' magic to this very crudely-realised series that makes you stick with it for the entire 13 episodes.  Kudos to Fox for the excellent remaster job (avoid the edition in the Legacy megaset...the quality is dross), and thanks also for the ultra-rare Next Episode trailers - pity there's no Making Of documentary.  As a specimen of 70s Saturday morning television, and for the Apes fanatic, this is a 100% must see - the final iteration of a series that changed Hollywood. It's just a pity that the animation makes Star Trek: TAS look like James Cameron's Avatar, that's all.  Ten bonus points to the guy who voiced Jeff. Perhaps the most wooden vocal performance in TV history!",1172016000,10,1543,4.717472118959108

The dvd quality is great as is the sound,its worth buying.
The budget was low so theirs a lot of scenes looping over and over but the still scene shots are awesome and ahead of their time.
Buy it and go back in time.",1160611200,7,503,3.9411764705882355
2511789,4,B000E991A2,"I thought of buying the Ape Head set to get this, but I didn't really like many of the sequels. The TV series was gold, the original movie was a masterpiece but I already owned those and didn't want to chance this short lived series at such a huge cost. Thankfully my waiting (for once) paid off! Though I am only 2 episodes into this I just had to give my 2 bits.

+ The use of color and shading I can already see is a 5/5. The look and feel of the show practically has a feature presentation quality to it. Light and shadow are almost as fun to watch in this series as the stories! At first I was a bit unsure of the Apes having newer technology, but for the most part it works. Another area that is GOLD is the sound. I think I would buy this soundtrack seperately it is THAT GOOD!! The sound totally molds the aura of the visual artistic vision and makes it whole, major props given here. The 2 episodes I have seen are quite vivid and the transfers are excellent.

- I took off a star mainly because the dialogue is a bit too stilted. I realize this is from '75 but even still the speech patterns seem to be caught in a slow motion where every word is annuciated almost painfully. The voice for Urko doesn't really fit the character, it sounds more like Fred Flinstone from the Fruity Pebble commercials. I  suppose the only other drawback is the lack of any sort of ""extras"". No history of the show, no nothing!

In closing; just looking at the wonderful box art, disc art, and price tag is practically reason enough to own this, let alone the artistic value I feel this brought to the franchise, sadly, like the live action TV show it ended far too soon. I did not watch this show as a child and have no memories of it and I wish I could say the same for the Tim Burton disaster of 2002.",1160438400,10,1794,4.146551724137931

However, having never seen the animated series I'd been dying to see this release on dvd...so to stumble upon it this past weekend was a dream come true. I have to agree with some of the other critics, the animation wasn't the best in the world, and the fact that it seems to be set with Cornelius, Zira, and Nova alive and well(after Beneath the Planet of the Apes) made the series stick out a bit with it's references to Brent, considering the world was supposed to have been blown to bits upons Cornelius and Zira's escape...but it does the whole Apes legacy justice in the same way that Animatrix does to the Matric Trilogy and Clone Wars to Star Wars. However, upon watching it for the 1st time, I noticed it was way ahead of its time, probably had so short a run because it was so dark and serious to be a Saturday morning cartoon, but oh well, a must have nonetheless.

2511793,4,B000E991A2,"The short-lived 13 episode animated Saturday morning cartoon revisited the Planet of the Apes but was a departure from the primitive landscape of the successful film franchise and live-action television series.  Without the constraints of expensive live-action production, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, which animated the classic Pink Panther cartoons, had the freedom to illustrate the lavish technologically advanced simian world as conceptualized by Pierre Boulle in his original novel La Plante des Singes.  On this planet, Ape City has all of the modern luxuries and conveniences of 20th century human civilization as astronauts Jeff Allen, Bill Hudson and Judy Franklin discover when they travel to the year 3979 and encounter an upside-down world ruled by a sophisticated society of talking apes and humans have lost the power of speech and live in exile in caverns.  They meet familiar characters Nova, Cornelius, Zira, Doctor Zaius and General Urko (provided by the recognizeable cartoon voice of Fred Flintstone) and references are made to astronauts Taylor and Brent from the films. Beyond the boundaries of Ape City exists the hostile desert no-man's (or ape's) land of the Forbidden Zone and a monastic order of telepathic humans known as the Underdwellers led by Kraydor who live beneath the surface.  Judy is taken captive by the Underdwellers after falling through a fissure from an earthquake where she is venerated as USA (pronounced Oosa) implying her metaphorical resemblance to Lady Liberty and the prophecy that she will help them restore the green planet that has been taken over by the militant apes.

Originally included as part of the expensive Ultimate Planet of the Apes collector's Ape Head set, Return to the Planet of the Apes is finally being released separately.  The transfers on those DVDs from their original 16mm film prints were very dirty with excessive gate weave throughout and with mono 2.0 sound but they have now been remastered and restored exclusively for their individual DVD release.

Here is the breakdown of all 13 24-minute episodes on 2 discs:

""Flames of Doom"" - Jeff, Bill and Judy travel through space and time and arrive on a strange planet that appears to be ruled by humans. As Bill is captured for study and Judy falls into a crack in the ground opened during an earthquake, Jeff is left alone to search for help but finds that the humans he meets are no more than primitive cavemen.

""Escape from Ape City"" - With Bill under study in Ape City, Jeff takes refuge with Nova and the other humans in the desert caves but are forced to leave when General Urko launches an attack against them. With the help of Cornelius and Zira, Bill escapes and goes in search of Jeff.

""The Unearthly Prophecy"" - With Urko advancing into the desert in search of them, Jeff and Bill are forced underground looking for help from the Underdwellers, a race of telepathic humans, but find a surprise waiting for them - Judy is alive!

""Tunnel of Fear"" - Bill and Jeff sneak back into Ape City under cover of darkness to ask Cornelius and Zira for help. Avoiding Urko's troops and a giant mutant spider, they listen as Cornelius tells them about New Valley, a place where they'll be safe from Urko. But can they get the humans there in time?

""Lagoon of Peril"" - To prove the existence of the talking humans, Urko demands that Zaius accompany him out to where Bill and Jeff's spaceship landed. With Cornelius warning them of this, Bill, Jeff and Nova set out to destroy their craft but something awaits them in the waters of the lagoon!

""Terror on Ice Mountain"" - Within an ancient ruin, Cornelius finds an ancient book, A Day At The Zoo but he realises that such subversive literature could prove dangerous. So he and Bill set off for the mountains where a holy sect is rumoured to live, who could protect the book until the time is right to announce its discovery.

""River of Flames"" - Kraydor and Judy contact Bill and Jeff asking for their help. The volcano over which the Underdwellers live is threatening to erupt and the lava is almost upon their reactor. Should the reactor fail, the entire planet is doomed. Bill and Jeff must reroute the lava before it is too late!

""Screaming Wings"" - Bill, Jeff and Judy are on their way to the human settlements when they see human shapes in the desert! Are there really humans there or are they targets for Urko's new weapon - a WWII fighter plane?

""Trail to the Unknown"" - With rafts to help move the humans on once more, this time to a lush green valley where they'll be left alone, Bill, Jeff and Judy find not only a wrecked spaceship but also its pilot, Ron Brent!

""Attack from the Clouds"" - One night in Ape City, there's panic as a giant flying lizard attacks. Believing that the humans are behind this, Urko and his troops set off to capture both the lizard and those responsible for it. But Jeff, Judy and Bill have no knowledge of this creature until, that is, it attacks them!

""Mission of Mercy"" - When Nova falls ill, Bill, Jeff and Judy realise that her only hope is that they contact Cornelius for a serum that will cure her. But with little aviation fuel left for the plane they stole from Urko, Bill and Jeff set out by road. Will they get the serum in time?

""Invasion of the Underdwellers"" - Burglars are striking all over Ape City and there's a panic when reports come of it being the fault of the human Underdwellers. Judy contacts Kraydor, who denies responsibility, so she, Jeff and Bill set out to prove that the burglars are really Urko's troops, looking for support in one last great strike against the humans.

""Battle of the Titans"" - After his framing of the Underdwellers, Urko has been relieved of duty and opinion in the Simian Council is swinging back towards the scientists. Cornelius believes that it is now time to present A Day At The Zoo and sets out with Bill to retrieve it. But the giant flying lizard is not finished with them yet!",1155254400,79,5958,4.7215799614643545
