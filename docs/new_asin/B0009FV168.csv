The DVD is instructional and NOT a workout.  While the description is good, it is unlikely one would watch this more than a few times.",1457827200,,271,4.723404255319149
8060172,5,B0009FV168,Master Wang is truly amazing. This is the best Qigong DVD available today. I have first hand knowledge of what Master Wang can do through Qigong- for I myself was a person who saw him for healing. Understanding the power behind the healing aspects of Qigong is also described throughout his book as well. By performing these simple exercises daily- I believe you will feel better! Thank you Master Wang!,1438214400,,403,4.771428571428571
