3027357,5,B000YDMPC4,"Never mind what you think of boxing pictures, sports pictures, or Josh Hartnett. Resurrecting the Champ concerns weighty matters of journalistic ethics, workplace ethics, how fathers raise their sons, the lives of the homeless, the steps people must take to achieve maturity, and most importantly, how we create myths about ourselves, especially with the help of the media. Along the way, it's about how history grinds up celebrities/heroes/public figures. (Is Samuel L. brilliant? You bet, but this reviewer's favorite scene just might be the one with Harry Lennix.)",1214092800,,567,5.454545454545454
3027358,5,B000YDMPC4,"Although Samuel L. Jackson long ago established himself as a great talent, he demonstrates his true range as an actor in ""Resurrecting the Champ"".  His touching and often humorous portrayal of a ""down and almost out"" former prizefighter is probably his finest work ever.  Hartnett and the remainder of the cast are quite good (it was nice to see Alan Alda), but this is Jackson's show all the way.  I would highly recommend this one for repeat viewing.",1212364800,2,452,4.769230769230769
3027359,5,B000YDMPC4,"While this movie may be a bit sappy and may be a little long, it is a great story about the relationship between fathers and sons integrated into a very loose interpretation of a true story.  Samuel Jackson turns in one of his best performances every that is more than deserving of an Academy Award.  No matter what your relationship is with your dad or with your son this movie will touch you at some level.  And anytime an audience can be touched or moved by a movie, it must be considered a great story and that coupled with Jackson's performance is the reason I give this movie all FIVE STARS.",1211587200,,597,4.36036036036036
3027360,5,B000YDMPC4,"Cool storyline, and great twist! If you had one shot, would you do the same? At 90% for better or worse, I beleive most would not.

3027361,5,B000YDMPC4,"But it Never ceases to amaze me why some people who review such films, have to spoil it for those who Haven't had a chance to see it? Any film that has Samuel Jackson, and Alan Alda in it? Im there. It was ""Everything and More"" than i Expected. A very moving, emotional film..that hits home in so many ways. If Jackson is Not nominated for an Academy Award? Something is wrong. One of his Most compelling, and heartfelt performances, ive ever seen. If you're looking for a movie that will hold your attention, and tell such a valuable story? This is One i highly recommend.

Why one review had to have a problem with an actor's hairstyle? Is way beyond me, its the last thing on my list, regarding a very important movie that should not be missed.",1207785600,11,747,4.374100719424461
3027362,2,B000YDMPC4,Sometimes I am wondering at reasons some movies have been created for - this one of adds and odds of a former boxer belongs exactly to these works.,1204502400,,147,4.285714285714286
3027363,5,B000YDMPC4,"The one thing that drove me crazy in this movie was Josh Harnett's hair.  I hate to sound like Grandpa Simpson, but ""Get a haircut punk!""  I suppose the act of moving his bangs out of his eyes every five seconds gives him chic points and street cred, but I found it distracting.  Having said that, this is an excellent movie.  There are many things to take from this movie, and I hate to take anyone's enjoyment away from the movie by revealing my perspective on it, but the father/son theme rang hard in my head throughout the movie.  Samuel L. Jackson is, of course, brilliant.  He doesn't even have to scream the patented Jackson scream in this movie to bring you on board.  The thing about this movie that separated it from 99% of the movies of 2007 was the fact that it was a brilliant story first and a great movie second.  I am sure I will receive some derision for saying this but, I did not see the plot twist coming.  The reviewer said there was some problem with the pace of this movie.  I thought it was perfect.  I enjoyed the subtle morsel I was provided.  Step by step, aspects of the plot are revealed.  The characters are methodically revealed through repetition and revelation.  With technology and the enhancements of the craft that have been learned through trial and error, most movies move along at a clip that can be dizzying at times.  Resurrection takes its time and develops the plot and the characters and by the time the ending rolls around you receive the payoff.  As a story teller, I found myself so exciting by the continuity of the conclusion I nearly leapt out of my seat screaming: ""YES!  That is it!""  Unfortunately, it appears this little gem was drowned out by the big budget blockbusters that weren't half the movie this one was.  Behind the movie Breech, I think this was the second best movie of 2007.",1202515200,9,1842,4.4774774774774775
3027364,4,B000YDMPC4,"We saw this movie right after a trailer for JUMPER, a time travel saga in which Samuel Jackson wears very close cropped hair in a shade of cotton white, forever attempting to pin Hayden Christensen down to real time using mountaineering spikes to do the job.  At this point my little boy asked me if it was true that Samuel Jackson is in every movie.  Yes, I told him, and as if to prove my point the lights went down and then up again on Jackson once more with white hair, but this time long loose cornrows of flyaway hobo hair, white and bedraggled with pieces of crab grass and straw sewn into it, as though truly proving he just doesn't care any more.

Apparently he was once an admired boxer, in the very early 50s, and now down on his luck he prowls Denver's darkest alley trundling along in a shopping cart and avoiding homeless bashers.  Josh Hartnett, as Eric Junior, son of a famous sportscaster, stumbles into him and soon realizes, this may be his ticket into the big leagues if he can do a creditable job on the story, give it some heart, he could slip it past heartless editor Alan Alda at the Denver Post, and make the cover of the paper's magazine section.  All this in an attempt to look good in the eyes of his former wife Kathryn Morris (in exaggerated, Goldie Hawn style makeup and hairdos) and his little boy who looks to be around 6.  For some reason I didn't figure out, he lost their respect a while back and now he's got one last chance to rewin them and make the nuclear family whole again.  I don't know if Josh Hartnett is the ideal actor to play this part, but I guess they thought, Jimmy Stewart is dead and Sally Field is a woman, so why not get Josh?  If there's scene chewing to be done, we already have Sam Jackson.

John Elway also makes an appearance as a typical Denver celebrity spotted by Josh's son at an alfresco restaurant and he insists that Dad must know him (for Josh has bragged to his son about his intimacy with all the greats of sport).  Elway has a winning screen presence and I would have liked to see what he could have done playing the champ turned hobo.  There's no reason why he had to be black.

But why did he have to be so old?  I don't know how old Jackson really is, but if the boxer in question saw his career come to a virtual end by Christmas of 1953 (as the movie takes great pains to establish), wouldn't he have to be, I don't know, 75 by now?  Jackson plays the role as though he had just gotten out of junior college, boisterous, rambling a mile a minute, with never flagging energy.  I guess he had to hail from an era before TV so there could be this lingering doubt about his identity but the ridiculousness of it all merits a demerit in my strict ratings system.  Beyond that, I asked my little one which of the three women Josh is involved with (Morris, Teri Hatcher, or Rachel Nichols from ALIAS)would make the best surrogate mother.  He said, Teri Hatcher hands down, as the ruthless, amoral TV executive from Showtime who cares about only two things, ratings number one, and Josh Hartnett horizontal the other.  So I give it a four out of five, docked a notch for being needlessly preposterous in that Rod Lurie way.",1199318400,4,3192,4.318257956448911
3027375,2,B000YDMPC4,"I am very open minded and like almost every type of movie. My favorite genre is sports inspirational and/or true stories so I'm typically biased to like this style of movie even more.

The truth is that this one just didn't make the cut.  I watched it on cable for free and still  felt that it was a waste of my time.",1258156800,2,317,4.080645161290323
3027376,3,B000YDMPC4,"Jackson's performance in this film was top notch, though the rest of it left something to be desired. With an interesting enough premise the plot became quickly predictable, which made Hartnett's character just seem a bit slow. I also kept waiting for some deeper insight into the politics of the sport in hopes of shedding light on why some of the Champ's decisions were made, to no avail.

3027378,3,B000YDMPC4,"Mediocre journalist, Erik Kernan Jr. (played by Josh Hartnett), continually lives in the shadow of his famous journalist father and strives to become a great writer in his own right instead of always living in the shadow of his legendary father.

Erik Kernan Jr. believes he has found his ""breakout story"", which will set him apart from the pack of other journalist, making him a star reporter worthy of writing top news stories.... Erik Kernan Jr. has stumbled across a homeless man believed to be a famous boxer long considered to be dead.... After spending countless hours with the homeless man, Erik Kernan Jr. writes and sells his story before doing the all important fact checking. Unfortunately, it isn't until the story is published, that Erik Kernan Jr. learns the true identity of the homeless man and learns that ""The Champ"" really isn't who he really claims to be at all! With an impending lawsuit, Erik Kernan Jr. finds himself in a lot of hot water. In the midst of controversy, Erik Kernan Jr. seemingly finds the true meaning of life through self examination/evaluation and learns valuable life lessons through the process that change him forever.

The message of the movie is good. The storyline was a bit slow and predictable, but otherwise a good movie.",1226966400,2,1272,4.8842592592592595
3027379,5,B000YDMPC4,"This was a very entertaining film with just the right mixture of action, drama, romance and intrigue. The latter - a big shock that occurs two-thirds of the way through the story - gives it its unique flavor. Otherwise, it's still a nice story of fathers-and-sons and the love and respect that's so important between the two of them. It also involves husbands and wives reconciling.

I've seen Samuel L. Jackson in a lot of movies and so I am quite aware what a fine actor he is, so I wasn't surprised he was so good in this film. However, I was still stunned at his performance. It's definitely the best character I've seen him play, partly because of his sentimental role but more so simply because he dominated this film. Josh Hartnett was fine in the co-leading role of this story but it was Jackson who really got my attention in every scene.

This is a very involving story that grabs you and won't let go. What is it about boxing stories, or stories that involve boxers, that make them so memorable? I don't know, but I've seen very few bad ones and certainly no boring ones. Many of them, like this one, have more of a human element than just being a sport story. Actually, there isn't a lot of ring action in this film, so I wouldn't label it a boxing film. As a drama, or whatever you want to label it, it's a fine movie and a good way to spend two hours.",1226707200,,1365,4.307392996108949
3027380,2,B000YDMPC4,"It's a shame to let such a good premise end up being such a mediocre movie! 'Resurrecting The Champ' could have been a great film, but it ends up feeling about as deep as the puddle of u r i n e ""the champ"" leaves in his alley every night! We never really learn anything about him and the story is more about a mediocre journalist trying to prove himself. Josh Hartnett lacks the acting skills to do anything with his role and there are a number of side stories that are distracting and the time could have been used developing a real story about this ""down and out"" boxer. Samuel Jackson turns in a good performance and it's the first time I can remember he wasn't shouting his lines at everyone in a film! It's OK for a rental, but I wouldn't waste my time on a second viewing.",1223769600,,779,4.2
3027381,5,B000YDMPC4,"While only the true diehard boxing fan is likely to be familiar with Bob Satterfield, the thunderous-punching, small heavyweight of the 1950's who missed being heavyweight champion by a hair's breadth, the movie actually has almost nothing to do with the great fighter.  At first glance virtually everyone contemplating watching this movie, myself included, has already imagined this movie from beginning to end before popping it in their DVD player, certain that they are about to watch the gripping saga of a talented sports hero/celebrity reduced to the inexcusable ravages of homelessness, yet another lesson on the intolerance of our society for those it perceives as  ""failures"" generally and of the disabled specifically.  You are prepared, no doubt, to witness the heart-tugging saga of a poor soul whose brain (and/or body) has been debilitated by too many punches, and the heartless society that kicks him when he is down because they never had the courage to do so when he was in his prime.  Well, that IS a great story, and is an unfortunate true story for many ex-boxers (see Sam Langford, one of the greatest fighters of all time, e.g.), but that is not this story.

The fortunate viewer is treated instead to a story about the complexity and relativity of success and failure, contrasting an admixture of various failures and successes and the complete lack of a nexus between material reward for true success, and the punishment of destitution for true failure.  The movie graphically shows the difficulty, and often, injustice, of applying such absolute final judgments as ""success"" and ""failure"" to an entire life, and how success/failure are in constant flux along the failure/success spectrum, not fixed finalities.

This is Samuel L. Jackson's best performance.  His character is tragically aware of his state of variable reduced capacity, and even candidly rates it when asked how he is doing!  Jackson also hauntingly and extremely accurately portrays how the mentally disabled often have periods of concise awareness and focus, and during those moments Jackson's eyes change accordingly to reflect The Champ's heightened awareness.

Jackson's great performance and a good storyline that you cannot predict or anticipate (and I have not given it away) are the two main reasons to see this very good movie.",1223164800,3,2328,5.184
3027382,5,B000YDMPC4,"When I started watching this movie I was not sure about what to expect, Samuel Jackson and Josh Hartnett had a great screen presence and portrayed their characters very well. Dakota Goyo is an adorable child actor and was great to watch.

3027384,4,B000YDMPC4,"A solid morality play with a jaw-dropper of a twist ending, RESURRECTING THE CHAMP scores a knockout with great acting and a thought-provoking message.

Samuel L. Jackson turns in a brilliant performance as a washed-up boxer who now calls the streets and back alleys of Denver his home. Josh Harnett also shows subtle acting chops as the young reporter determined to tell the Champ's story. Alan Alda, too, is utterly convincing as the tough but kind newspaper editor who pushes his young writers to greatness.

The film shows a wonderful understanding of newsroom dynamics, and how writers and editors conspire to reel in a great story on deadline.

The movie's only weak point comes in the form of some heavy-handed moralizing that would have been better left to the viewers' own conclusions.

However - with its truly shocking conclusion and an excellent ensemble cast, RESURRECTING THE CHAMP is a film no viewer will soon forget.",1214092800,,933,5.0

3261878,5,B000YDMPC4,"While only the true diehard boxing fan is likely to be familiar with Bob Satterfield, the thunderous-punching, small heavyweight of the 1950's who missed being heavyweight champion by a hair's breadth, the movie actually has almost nothing to do with the great fighter.  At first glance virtually everyone contemplating watching this movie, myself included, has already imagined this movie from beginning to end before popping it in their DVD player, certain that they are about to watch the gripping saga of a talented sports hero/celebrity reduced to the inexcusable ravages of homelessness, yet another lesson on the intolerance of our society for those it perceives as  ""failures"" generally and of the disabled specifically.  You are prepared, no doubt, to witness the heart-tugging saga of a poor soul whose brain (and/or body) has been debilitated by too many punches, and the heartless society that kicks him when he is down because they never had the courage to do so when he was in his prime.  Well, that IS a great story, and is an unfortunate true story for many ex-boxers (see Sam Langford, one of the greatest fighters of all time, e.g.), but that is not this story.

The fortunate viewer is treated instead to a story about the complexity and relativity of success and failure, contrasting an admixture of various failures and successes and the complete lack of a nexus between material reward for true success, and the punishment of destitution for true failure.  The movie graphically shows the difficulty, and often, injustice, of applying such absolute final judgments as ""success"" and ""failure"" to an entire life, and how success/failure are in constant flux along the failure/success spectrum, not fixed finalities.

This is Samuel L. Jackson's best performance.  His character is tragically aware of his state of variable reduced capacity, and even candidly rates it when asked how he is doing!  Jackson also hauntingly and extremely accurately portrays how the mentally disabled often have periods of concise awareness and focus, and during those moments Jackson's eyes change accordingly to reflect The Champ's heightened awareness.

Jackson's great performance and a good storyline that you cannot predict or anticipate (and I have not given it away) are the two main reasons to see this very good movie.",1223164800,3,2328,5.184

3261881,4,B000YDMPC4,"A solid morality play with a jaw-dropper of a twist ending, RESURRECTING THE CHAMP scores a knockout with great acting and a thought-provoking message.

Samuel L. Jackson turns in a brilliant performance as a washed-up boxer who now calls the streets and back alleys of Denver his home. Josh Harnett also shows subtle acting chops as the young reporter determined to tell the Champ's story. Alan Alda, too, is utterly convincing as the tough but kind newspaper editor who pushes his young writers to greatness.

The film shows a wonderful understanding of newsroom dynamics, and how writers and editors conspire to reel in a great story on deadline.

The movie's only weak point comes in the form of some heavy-handed moralizing that would have been better left to the viewers' own conclusions.

However - with its truly shocking conclusion and an excellent ensemble cast, RESURRECTING THE CHAMP is a film no viewer will soon forget.",1214092800,,933,5.0

It was not quite I expected but ended up with even a better one and a suprised story.
It has all the things in life, making mistake,  forgiveness, love, ashame, redemption,reunion with the lover ext.

The story is about Josh Hartnett a journalist who is in trouble having separated with his wife, not writing good stories for his newspaper for awhile.
He had a chance one day by meeting this guy on the street(Samuel L. Jackson) . It seems that he was a forgottened ex- champion who is now living on the street.
By the time when he first meet this guy, he was seriously bitten up by a bunch of guys.
He decided to write a story about that ex-champ.
When he saw the TV fighting resource, he even confirmed that the champ has a scar on his chest which this guy on the street has exactly the same one too.
Then he wrote the story which happens to be a huge success. He even appears on TV.

But then again, he found out that he made a huge mistake.
The guy on the street was not the champ. He was the other guy on the fight with the champ who was knocked out at the second round.
By that time, the champ's son and the trainer came and tell the reporter Josh Hartnett that they will sue him.
Now he is in a big touble not only because he will be sued but because he was seriously damaged his career.
Even when he appeared in his son's lectue, all of his friends laughed at him.

But he's got a second chance by the champ's son and his family. They asked him to write another article.
By that time the fake champ one day was drunk and again was about to punched by this guy again. But this time he had this fighting instinct back and beat him back. He won his dignity. But sadly he died by losing his breath. He was too old for fighting.
After the funeral Josh made up his mind and wrote a great article. He made it.
He also reunited with his wife and his son too.

Josh, Samuel his wife who is also a joulanist and their son they all are resurrected at the end.

I expected a boxer who will gain something at the beginning but the story was something else which was even better -turned out to be.

If you have a chance, you should definately have to watch this movie. It's not a cliche movie and you will love every minute of it.

The wife of Josh is also very lovely and you will feel the same. (Kathryn Morris )
Samuel, Josh are as usual all great.
All the other actors were good too.

It's a great small piece of work we got here.",1462752000,,2511,4.097759674134419

8232250,4,B000YDMPC4,"""Resurrecting the Champ"" is a drama film that is based on true events but there are some alterations to facts from the real story. Notwithstanding this the narrative still presents an interesting account which highlights the need for media prudency.

The cast has a wide range of experience and appealing screen energy. Samuel L. Jackson (the Champ), Josh Hartnett (Reporter Erik Kernan Jr), and Alan Alda (News Editor Ralph Metz) all give a good performance as does the entire cast.

This film enables the viewer to appreciate that there are times when the truth is not always the story we want it to be.

8232251,5,B000YDMPC4,Josh Hartnet and Samuel L Jackson play an extraordinary duo in this fantastic movie. Hignly recommended especially if you're a fan of these two actors,1324684800,3,150,5.04
8232252,4,B000YDMPC4,"I've seen many complaints from reviewers that Resurrecting the Champ is just a flat out boring film.  I can see why so many people are coming to that conclusion.

The story isn't one of the best, that's for sure, and the film is certainly NOTHING like the classic Rocky films, so don't go assuming there will be a dramatic boxing match at the end of the movie that will satisfy your secret love for intense punching action, because it ain't gonna happen.  Completely different movies.

What makes the storyline sort of boring is the fact that WAY too much of it focuses on the aimless walking and talking reporter aspect, and less on communicating with the boxer himself.

I don't know about you, but I would have been MUCH more satisfied had most of the movie been devoted to scenes showing Samuel L. Jackson's character, and less on the other guy who played the reporter role.

Resurrecting the Champ is about a news reporter looking for a big story to cover for the paper, and through a painfully slow and uninteresting build-up in character development and storyline, the reporter eventually finds a homeless man living on the streets that used to be a big-name boxer a long time ago... or at least, that's what it appears.  Keep watching the film to see what's REALLY going on.

Why the movie doesn't stack up to the hype is because the story is just so sloooooow to not only get going, but to actually GET anywhere.  The pace never picks up for its entire 2-hour running time, and despite a magnificent performance by Samuel L. Jackson, you have to be *very* patient to sit still and pay attention to a storyline that's honestly mediocre at best.

However, despite the problems, I can't deny I was sitting there and enjoying the film, and I really was curious to see the next plot development... for whatever reason.  Maybe I was just in the mood to watch a movie this afternoon, who knows?  Maybe I wanted to believe the hype?

I'll give the movie a 4 out of 5 rating, but you should know it's a weak 4, maybe even a high 3.",1258502400,2,2031,4.501362397820164
