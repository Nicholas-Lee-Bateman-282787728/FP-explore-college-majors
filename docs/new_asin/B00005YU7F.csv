1676632,5,B00005YU7F,"the documentary aired this past week on the discovery channel and i was enchanted!  i couldn't tear myself away from the tv.  the footage is unbelievable and purely breathtaking.  the whole time we were watching we were saying ""how did they film that?"" and ""i can't believe they were able to see that.""  it was so amazing to get to see these animals within their habitat and seemingly unaware of anyone nearby. (and the footage is always crystal clear!)  feeding frenzies, mating rituals, abysmal creatures and whale feedings are just some of the insights into this superb film.  the filmmakers deserve high honors for pulling off one of the best quality documentaries i've ever seen!  bravo!",1012608000,,692,4.913793103448276
1676633,5,B00005YU7F,"This documentary is absolutely amazing! The lengths the photographers have gone through to capture this amazing footage raises the bar for all others. This is not your ordinary nature film. From Antartica, to undersea volcanos 3 miles down where few people have ever been, the footage is stunning. You'll see recently discovered sea life that few have ever seen. (More people have been into space then to the bottom of our ocean trenches) David Attenborough's narration is first rate. The DVD also includes some behind the scenes footage not seen on the Discovery special.",1012521600,,572,5.095744680851064
1676634,5,B00005YU7F,"Assuming that the transfer is decent (a pretty safe bet), this DVD should be absolutely amazing.  A few scuba diving friends that I know in England were raving about the series when they got to see it way back in September, and they were dead on the money.  This show has amazing footage of the undersea world, scenes that I can only dream about seeing for myself, even with the travelling I do for my own scuba vacations.  I had to stop saying ""wow"" whenever something breathtaking was shown, because I was saying it non-stop.",1012435200,,527,4.526315789473684
1676635,1,B00005YU7F,"The original BBC series from which these are derived was a set of 8 episodes of 50 minutes each. The full set fills 3 DVDs. This abridged version contains only 3 of the eight original episodes and an additional introductory episode that is hacked together from scenes of these 3 and some additional footage from the nearly 5 hours of the series that is omitted.
After 5 years of filming around the world and high critical acclaim for the series, it's a travesty that when brought to the US market the whole thing is butchered and the majority of it eliminated from the package (and from its broadcast on the Discovery Channel).
These two discs will provide a taste of the full original, and they do contain some stunning and unique scenes of ocean life. However, it would be better to petition the BBC and Discovery Channel to release the full series in US Region 1 encoding (so that it will play on our DVD players). Purchasing this version will only reward those responsible for trying to sell us less than half of this remarkable series at nearly same cost as the full 3 DVD set.",1012435200,27,1082,4.525510204081633
7957006,5,B00005YU7F,"This was the best filming of this subject that I have seen. It was fascinating and educational: I didn't know what fierce hunters Killer Whales are. The filming of two of their brutal hunts is graphically honest. The unimaginable beauty of the biofluorescence of certain deep water life is hypnotic to watch. The biology of teeming life in the boiling temperatures near the hydrothermal ocean vents is amazing. There is even a brine LAKE on the ocean floor!

This four-part series would be a wonderful addition to everyone's nature DVD collection as it would be suitable for chldren and adults alike. What a lovely gift this would be.",1182729600,,634,4.87037037037037
7957007,5,B00005YU7F,"A science fiction fantasy told and presented as reality. Which doesn't seem like much until you realize this *is* reality. Unearthly creations both monstrous and spellbinding, painstakingly caught on video and presented in the comfort of your living room. No prior knowledge of undersea life is necessary to enjoy this visual feast. Even my 5 and 7 year-old children find this video as fascintating as those about dinasours.
By the way, I brought this DVD series after reading the book of the same name. The book obviously goes into more detail but both are a highly recommended addition to your library.",1040860800,,604,4.99009900990099
7957008,4,B00005YU7F,"I gave this as a gift to someone who knows a thing or two about marine biology and fully expected that person to cite all the discrepancies and untruths each video contained. To my utter surprise (and relief!) the recipient enjoyed all 4 episodes (2 per tape, also a surprise) and actually learned a few things too!
That other 2-pk (Part 3 and Part 4 of the series) is looking pretty good as a follow-up gift.",1032393600,,409,4.394736842105263
7957009,4,B00005YU7F,"I spent an entire afternoon viewing these DVDs, and am quite impressed with the completeness of this series.  It has footage I've never dreamed of having the priveldge of seeing, and pretty much all I watch on TV is wildlife and environmental promgramming. The cinematography and accompanying score play well into each other -basically, if you want a first-class, close-up, stunningly unique view of the oceans, this would be the thing to watch.  I'm still awed by the camera angles and lighting the photographers were able to obtain.  Who would've thought that bioluminescence could be so absolutely beautiful, albiet otherworldly, or the panicked finesse of a giant shoal of sardines could be downright graceful and mesmerizing to watch?
However, if you're sensitive to the delicate balance of predator/prey, be warned.  I was surprised to see this series so laden with predation.  It seems to me the series should be called ""The Food Chain of the Sea"", as almost every sequence on both DVD's contained footage of one animal losing its life to another, including a lengthy sequence of a pod of Orcas attempting and succeeding at killing a grey whale calf.  The calculated and perfectly-timed maneuvering of the Orcas is completely engrossing, but mothers and sensitive individuals will more than likely find it extremely disturbing to witness, since, although the event is part of the natural scheme of things, one can't help but be saddened at the way the event unfolds.
All in all, other than the heavy predation, this series is informative, educational and excellent viewing.  You will not be sorry for your purchase.",1028160000,6,1622,5.09811320754717
7957010,5,B00005YU7F,"I'm not going to post my review that has been said by others.
What I'm saying here is that the series has a same named book.
To avoid you diffculty in finding the book (as many same named books may show up), the book ISDN is 0789482657, you can use it to pinpoint the book directly using amazon search engine.
The book is a great supplimentary to the DVD (in fact, I'd rather think the DVDs are the great supplimentary to the book), the book covers so many info how and why the ocean is as what we see today and on the DVD, the sea formation with each evolution, yet easy to understand,  coupled with amazing photos and chaptered roughly equvalent as the DVD. The information is not duplicate with the narration found in the DVD series. Personally from knowledage points of view I got much more and with broader background knowledge while watch the series.
I highly recommend it.
(Proud owner of the book and the DVD series).",1024531200,3,925,4.4411764705882355
7957011,5,B00005YU7F,"The BBC 3-disc set which I bought in London on my last trip is produced with Region 0 which will make it play in many North American players. I share the enthusiasm of the other reviewers on the 8 main parts of the show but I particularly find the additional material worth mentioning. The documentary ""Deep Trouble"" shows the damage of over exploitation and agressive fishing methods in the ocean. I recommend watching this to everyone who liked the pictures of the main episodes as a wake up-call that we are about to destroy all this beauty.",1021248000,,544,4.618556701030927
7957012,5,B00005YU7F,"I'm jaded and bitter....NOTHING surprises ME...
THIS DID...
  Absolutely wonderful camera work, research, and execution. NOT AT ALL ""like the rest of the nature documentries"". NO ONE has DONE THIS before !...I promise. It seems the crew and the researchers were at the perfect place at the perfect time, for the perfect shot...EVERY time. And the new camera technology is awsome...BUY...BUY...BUY",1017792000,,396,5.475409836065574
7957013,5,B00005YU7F,"I live in Chicago, which is nearly a thousand miles from salt water, so I know very little about the sea. Normally, I'd skip a ""nature series"" like this, but a glowing review in the ""Wall Street Journal"" piqued my interest; so I bought the set. And am I glad I did! Each show is informative, yet dazzling entertainment: beautifully photographed, well edited, and framed with just the right narration and music. The series arouses your sense of awe at the world of nature around us.
Everyone in the family, from my teenagers to my four-year-old, enjoyed the series. However, the little guy was very upset when he saw the baby whale being taken down by the killers; you may wish to keep that from young children.
The DVD transfer is excellent; it looks great even on our old Toshiba using composite video. As a bonus, each program comes with a ten-minute ""making of"" documentary; and each disk has an in-depth interview with a member of the production staff.
I've pre-ordered the second set, and we're looking forward to the day it arrives.",1016582400,2,1038,4.6775956284153
7957014,5,B00005YU7F,"From the commercials before the airing, I knew this was going to
be good...but boy, it greatly exceeded my expectations.  The photography is uterly amazing.  I still don't know how they got some of the shots.  I look forward to showing friends and family the DVD's for years and cant wait for the next release.  This set not only is a great purchase, but makes a phenominal gift for anyone.",1014163200,,390,4.5285714285714285
7957015,5,B00005YU7F,"Unlike what the previous reviewer said, these are not butchered copies. These volumes are only the first 4 episodes, if you look on Amazon.com they have the other two(which contain the final four of the eight part series) for pre-order aswell(coming out much later, May 7th). The order of the BBC episodes were changed some, but everything else is the same(they also changed the first episodes title from ""Introduction"" to ""Ocean World"", and I like the new one better) If you don't believe me, go to the official BBC website, and compare the episode titles, you will see they are the same, albiet mixed up in the order.
The first volume of the dvd contains ""Ocean World"" and Frozen Seas"". Ocean World is the first BBC episode, and is the first Region 1 DVD(R1DVD) episode. Frozen Seas is the next R1DVD episode, and is on the same volume as the first. However, it was originally broadcast 4th on the BBC(see official bbc page). The second volume of the R1DVD contains episode ""The Deep"" and ""Open Ocean"" the Deep was originally broadcast 2nd on the BBC, and is moved to fourth for the R1DVD. Open Ocean remains at the same spot, episode 3. While the other two volumes information hasn't been released yet, they will both contain two episodes each, bringing the total up to 8 episodes, the original number. I hope this helps.
