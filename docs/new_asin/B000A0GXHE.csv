2345034,5,B000A0GXHE,"Joining televisions other military comedies of the day was this overlooked gem. The thing that set ""F Troop"" apart from ""Hogan's Heroes"" and ""McHale's Navy"" was the fact that, while not politically correct, it was fair. The brave men of Fort Courage were as inept, sometimes moreso, than the Indian tribes of the area.

Led with a gentle hand by Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry), F Troop had a bugler who couldn't bugle, a soldier in the guard tower who couldn't see, and a cannon that usually caused damage to the fort when fired. He was ably assisted by Sgt. O'Roarke (Forrest Tucker) and Corporal Agarn (Larry Storch). Berry was adept at physical comedy, much like Dick Van Dyke he came from a dancing background. Storch was an over-the-top stand-up comic whose routine often lent itself to some fun moments in the show. Tucker was the stalwart Marshal Dillon type. Although a con-man, he had a soft spot for both Agarn and the Captain.

This collection gathers six episodes, 3 color and 3 black/white. The transfers are generally very good with minimal screen noise. The black and white episodes look a bit better, but only because of the oversaturated color of the other episodes.

Overall, for the price this is a great piece of nostagic entertainment.",1128211200,86,1262,4.833333333333333
2345035,5,B000A0GXHE,"The first F TROOP release since Columbia House put 30 episodes out on VHS in 1998, this DVD in Warner's ""Television Classics"" series offers 6 episodes of the classic sitcom, which was ahead of its time in having scheming characters who did NOT have 'hearts of gold' (O'Rourke and Agarn) and subversively combined this with kiddy-friendly slapstick.  Until the producers decided to go overboard with the slapstick angle and soften O'Rourke and Agarn in season two (arguably what killed the show), this was a true classic, anticipating SEINFELD in that our lead characters always wondered ""what's in it for me?"" and never learned any lessons in the end.

This sampler DVD could use a better episode selection: JOHNNY EAGLE EYE, THE 86 PROOF SPRING, THE DAY THE INDIANS WON and O'ROURKE VS. O'REILLY are among the B&W classics ignored, and THE RETURN OF BALD EAGLE has the somewhat grating presence of Don Rickles and is one of the first season's lesser lights.  But the compilation quickly recovers: THE GIRL FROM PHILADELPHIA sees O'Rourke Enterprises threatened by Parmenter's old girlfriend seeking marriage and a transfer, which in turn has O'Rourke and the Hekawis scheming to get rid of her; INDIAN FEVER finds Agarn afflicted with the title disease.

Although the second (color) season is not as good as the first, the 3 color episodes included here are all true highlights, arguably the 3 finest episodes from that season.  THE SINGING MOUNTIE features Paul Lynde as the title character (and yes, he does proclaim that we ""always get our man"") and also showcases Larry Storch in a dual role.  Storch was at his best, and deservedly Emmy-nominated for this series (he lost to the late Don Adams in 1967), and the writers test the 1960's censors by naming the character ""Lucky Pierre"".  BYE BYE BALLOON guest stars Harvey Korman as a Prussian balloonist who causes trouble by brainwashing Agarn and threatening the make the men of F Troop ""real soldiers"".  And best of all, OUR BRAVE IN F TROOP is one of the few season two episodes to really recapture the feel of season one, as O'Rourke and Agarn sneak Chief Wild Eagle into the army to get his tooth pulled, not knowing that General Sam Courage (guest star Cliff Arquette) is planning a surprise visit!

Though Larry Storch is deservedly cited, kudos should also go to Forrest Tucker, who reinvented himself as a comedian after 25 years of dead-serious film roles as both hero and villain (some 15 years before Leslie Nielsen did this in AIRPLANE!) and to the very underrated physical comedian Ken Berry, whose talents for physical comedy were fully explored here; strangely, his talents were largely ignored in his later series MAYBERRY R.F.D.

A fine sampler, but a boxed SEASON ONE DVD set is what we REALLY need, Warners!  Get on that right away... and that's an order!",1128211200,26,2830,4.875

Thank you DVD gods for finally releasing F troop. I have waited a long time for it. They do not make comedies like this anymore, nor are the current actors up to the same par.  Larry Storch is hilarious and the only hope I have now, that the DVD gods release all the episodes in time..

2345038,3,B000A0GXHE,"FYI - This dvd includes 6 episodes only.  3 b&w, 3 color.  There are no special features.  There is no chronological order to the episodes - it seems they were chosen for the guest stars.  The episodes are:

1 - ""The Return of Bald Eagle"" with Don Rickles
2 - ""The Girl From Philadelphia"" with Edward Everett Horton as Roaring Chicken
3 - ""Indian Fever"" with Victor Jory as Mean Buffalo
4 - ""The Singing Mounty"" with Paul Lynde (singing ""I dream of Wrangler with the light 'yeller' hair"", and Larry Storch playing Agarn's French cousin Lucky Pierre, the suspected 'Burglar  of Banf-f').  Great episode.
5 - ""Bye, Bye Balloon"" with Harvey Korman as Prussian Col. Heinrick Von Zeppel.
6 - ""Our Brave in F Troop"" with Cliff Arquette (whoever that is), as General Sam Courage.

For desperate F-Troop fans it's better than nothing, but it's disappointing to only have these few arbitrary episodes.

2345039,5,B000A0GXHE,"Just picked up this disc yesterday on it's release. I was already sold on it on the basis of Larry Storch being a God, but after reading the guest star list & seeing Don Rickles (another God), I didn't think it could be any better. But yes, it could! This disc includes my all-time favorite F-Troop episode, ""The Singing Mountie"". This episode is not only a showcase for Larry Storch (a God), who plays Corp. Agarn and his lookalike cousin Pierre, it also features Supreme Comedy Godhead Paul Lynde as the Singing Mountie.

  My mind reels and unreels every time Paul Lynde is introduced as a Mountie because he follows the introduction with, ""We always get our man"" while making a wry smile.

2345041,5,B000A0GXHE,"Love this 60's classic sitcom!

This situation comedy originally aired from September 1965 - April 1967 and produced a total of 65 episodes.

The show revolves around the incompetents of a post-Civil War day troop stationed at Fort Courage, somewhere West of the Missouri.

The cast includes good-hearted, but bumbling Captain Wilton Parmenter (Ken Berry of Mama's Family) who's always getting into trouble or trying to keep his troop from staying out of trouble.  Sergeant Morgan O'Rourke (Forrest Tucker) who appears to be the brains of the group, and the one who tries to straighten everything out.  And then there's, Corporal Randolph Agarn (Larry Storch), O'Rourke's chief aid and assistant schemer who, almost always, is involved in one mess or another.  Lastly, there's Wrangler Jane Angelica Thrift (Melody Paterson), the woman whose only focus is to marry Captain Parmenter.

The series is sprinkled with,the some time friendly, Hekawi Indians who interact with F-Troop represented by Chief Wild Eagle (Frank DeKova), Crazy Cat (Don Diamond) and Roaring Chicken (Edward Everett Horton) to name a few.

Additional supporting cast characters are Corporal Hannibal Dobbs (James Hampton), Trooper Duffy (Bob Steele), Trooper Vanderbilt (Joe Brooks) and Trooper Hoffenmueller (John Mitchum) who all add to the hi-jinx of the show.

Put them all together for one crazy, and very entertaining time!

This DVD release is what I would call a ""sampler"" release.  There are only 6 episodes on it. Perhaps, if the response is great - the whole series releases will follow.

It is a great way to sample the show without making a large investment!!  [...] What do you have to lose??  So please, please buy it!

2345042,3,B000A0GXHE,"This series was a sort of a Western predecessor of ""McHale's Navy"" (the original Ernest Borgnine series) in the way it centered around a military unit made of goofy misfits. This one was about a fictitious U.S. Cavalry unit, fort made of vertical logs and all. It's roughly the same setting as the old ""Rin Tin Tin"" series a bit earlier. The lead role is played by comedian and comic actor Larry Storch, who is credited by the late Cary Grant as having been the real originator of the ""Judy Judy Judy"" shtick used by most people who do a Cary Grant impression, on the amateur and sometimes even the professional level. Apparently, according to Grant, Storch was playing a nightclub gig and was in the middle of a Grant impression when Judy Garland showed up as a patron, and Storch greeted her in character.",1122163200,5,807,4.572413793103448

2345182,5,B000A0GXHE,"Really. ""F Troop"" is incredibly FUNNY! If you're looking for an evening of wackiness, ""F Troop"" is the ticket. It's as much a hoot now as it was over 40 years ago! Like most of the reviewers here, I'd love to see Warner Brothers release an additional volume.

Here's a brief synopsis of the six episodes (which aired from 1965 to 1966) that you will get in this set. The first three are in black and white; the last three are in colour.

""Indian Fever"" has Cpl. Agarn seeing a fierce Indian brave.

""The Girl from Philadelphia"" sees an old flame from Philadelphia and feisty Wrangler Jane (Melody Patterson) vying for Capt. Wilton Parmenter's (Ken Barry) attention and affection.

""The Return of Bald Eagle"" is played by Don Rickles. Those familiar with Rickles' antics will appreciate this one.

""The Singing Mountie"" stars Paul Lynde (Uncle Arthur from ""Bewitched"") impersonating a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer in pursuit of fur trapper Lucky Pierre (Larry Storch). As it turns out, Lind is 'The Burglar of Bamff-ff"", a right royal rogue out to steal Lucky Pierre's mink pelts. This one's a riot!

""Bye, Bye Balloon"" features Harvey Korman (the comedian best known for his skits on the Carol Burnett Show) playing a Prussian Colonel who has been sent to set up a hot air balloon corps. Larry Storch plays his adjutant who looks after his dachshund named Schnitzel. You'll bust a gut laughing over this one!

""Our Brave in F Troop"" has Chief Wild Eagle (Frank de Kova)enlisting in the army to have a bad tooth pulled. While serving at Fort Courage, a retiring General pays a visit to the fort and subsequently promotes him to the rank of Major. Does Chief Wild Eagle get his tooth pulled while in the army? I won't spoil your fun and tell.

What I as a European consider especially noteworthy is the fact, that for once there is no division between the Good and the Bad or the Smart and the Stupid - not exactly a common 'sight' in comedy of the era, especially when US Armed Forces happen to be in the plot... And the issues addressed and made fun of are as valid today as they were at the time of the first airing in the 60's.
