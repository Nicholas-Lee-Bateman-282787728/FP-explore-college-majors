3774070,5,B001R7IH5A,"If you are not a person of faith but think there just might be something to this ""God"" thing. Take a look at ""How Great is Our God"" and for sure don't miss ""Fruitcake & Ice Cream"". If you are Atheist or Agnostic, you will come to believe in God. If you are alone today, Hell is eternal separation from God. It doesn't get any more lonely than that. If you decide, after viewing this video series, church is for you. You will come to know God. Church folks are warm and friendly and don't expect you to be ""holy"". Loneliness vanishes when you are with believers. This one video will set your heart ablaze and melt away the guilt and loneliness. The video won't save you. God will, if you ask. Just ask, ""Jesus please come into my heart today. I am sorry for my conscious sinning. I want you to be my Savior from sin. I want to spend eternity with you in Heaven.""  You do this in your private place, alone with God. No one has to see but God. I pray you find God today.",1419033600,,967,4.116402116402116

3774086,5,B001R7IH5A,The Heart Of Passion is an awesome work by Louie Giglio.  It's worth 10 stars from my point of view,1404777600,,99,3.95
3774087,5,B001R7IH5A,"This series is absolutely wonderful.  It presents the gospel and a look at a limitless God in possibly the clearest way I have ever heard.  How Great is Our God is unmatched at looking at our universe and what it tells us about our Creator.  Fruitcake and Ice Cream vividly shows our need for love and forgiveness that only Christ can provide -- and shows it through the life of a college-age girl. Hope When Life Hurts Most addresses the age-old question of why an omnipotent God allows suffering, including our most urgent question when we are hurting: ""Why me?""  While Indescribable has less production value than the other three -- it was probably recorded earlier in his career -- it still offers amazing and heart-warming insights into God through the universe He created. Highly recommended!",1399680000,,798,4.845588235294118

3774096,5,B001R7IH5A,"This is powerful & I encourage everyone to see this. Louie presents our God in a way that you'll never forget. I'd seen it before, but felt compelled to get it to show it to a coworker that thinks he's an atheist. This completely negates the possibility that this universe just 'happened'.",1381104000,,289,4.576923076923077
3774097,5,B001R7IH5A,Awe inspiring!  Louie gives a heartfelt mind blowing presentation of how great our God is through vastness of the universe.  A MUST see!,1380758400,,136,4.869565217391305
3774098,5,B001R7IH5A,"Louie Giglio is known for traveling to universities and youth groups and sharing these talks, but this series is incredibly relevant to people of all ages (13 and older I would suggest).  I organize a Women's Bible Study and during the summer we were eager to stay connected and continue our studies, but no one was eager for doing a lot of reading and homework.  We decided to get together and watch these as our ""Summer Movie Series"" each Thursday night.  We had about 25-30 women in attendance each week and it was a very powerful series that impacted everyone in our group.

There are actually five different DVD's and six separate sessions contained in this pack.  Each video is roughly 45 - 55 minutes and each one contains a very powerful message. Our group loved each message so much that many women have borrowed the DVD's to share with their husbands, friends and/or kids.

1. Indescribable - This video shows us the bigness of God and His universe through a lot of pictures that were taken by NASA.  It shows us that our Milky Way Galaxy is only a small cul-de-sac of the entire universe that God has created. It surely puts into perspective ""His thoughts are bigger than our thoughts"" and ""His ways are not our ways"".  While you might feel small vs. the massive universe that God created by the end of this video, you are also left with the precise plan that He has for all of His creation and how you might fit into the bigger tapestry of what God has created.
2. How Great Is Our God - This video continues the highly fascinating astronomy lesson and shows us the different planets and stars that God has created in relation to our small earth that we call home.  The overriding message goes deeper to show God's perfect design to equip us with everything that we for when we go through a difficult time.  It would be a spoiler alert if I told you about Laminin.  Let Louie tell you.
3. Hope When Life Hurts - This is a two part video (each approximately 50 minutes) and you will probably want to watch them at different times.  The first message is The Anchor Of Hope and shares the story of a teen boy who cried out to God in despair and his prayer was not answered...even though he had prayed for other people and had seen God miraculously answer prayers those prayers.  A heart wrenching story, but Louie is quick to explain that not everything gets wrapped up in a perfect bow at the end when we become Christians. It's a crazy world and bad things happen, but God is never not in control but free will has been permitted.  The second message is The Megaphone Of Hope.  This is the most powerful sermon I have ever heard that makes sense of the purpose of suffering and how God can be glorified through difficulties.
4. Fruitcake & Ice Cream - This is the story of a university girl who was a very strong atheist until her Christian roommate attended a Louie Giglio talk and was raving about it.  As she lived with this Christian, she saw that there really was something different about this girl and the way she lived her life.  She started listening to Louie too and eventually became convinced that God and God's grace were for her too.  I don't want to share anymore to give it away, but it's a sweet and funny story told through this girls journals (as only a college girl can write).  You will laugh.  You will cry.
5. Symphony (I Lift My Hands) - This video will completely change the way you think about worship.  Although this may sound like a boring video, you will see how God has designed every living creature to worship Him and we are all a part of God's Symphony.

Louie Giglio is also involved in sixsteprecords - the production company for many leading Christian musicians  -- most notably Chris Tomlin and Matt Redman.  Some of these talks have inspired some of the greatest Christian songs of all time by Chris Tomin:  Indescribable, How Great Is Our God, Symphony (I Lift My Hands), etc. and Matt Redman:  You Never Let Go.  Louie has also written several songs with Chris during their journey together.  They now head up Passion City Church in Atlanta with Louie as the Senior Pastor and Chris leading the music and worship. Be sure to list to many of these songs in detail while you are watching the video too.  It will give you a deeper appreciation of some of the thoughts behind the music.

This is a great video to be used by your family, individually, for a Bible Study or small group!!  There is also a pamphlet included with discussion questions for each video, but some are so powerful that after viewing it might be best not to talk. It will leave a lasting impression.",1376956800,,4619,4.469606674612634
3774099,5,B001R7IH5A,I enjoyed the Truth Project series and that is how I came to know about this dvd.  Everyone should look at tis one as ell as the Truth Project.,1376438400,,143,3.9310344827586206

3774114,5,B001R7IH5A,I really enjoyed listening to these talks about God in our universe.  They are very interesting and relevant and something a church group would enjoy seeing.  They are even a good challenge for non-Christian friends to watch because they certainly make any person think of what they really believe and why.,1366588800,,306,4.980392156862745

3774118,5,B001R7IH5A,Louie Giglio delivers some great food for thought and scriptures to go with it.  While I differ from him in certain doctrinal issues these lessons are without a doubt worth checking out!,1361059200,,186,4.8125
3774119,4,B001R7IH5A,"Very good educational DVDs. Comming in a 4 pack takes a while to watch (sometime more than once), but being in a 4 pack it trimms the cost :-)",1358812800,,142,3.9310344827586206

3774121,5,B001R7IH5A,"Great and practical material about God. Whether you are new to Christianity or a long time believer, there is something here for all. Louie opens the mind by kicking down the sides of the box. That box we sometimes have God encased in. From the ""Bigness"" of God to the stunning presentation of the creation of man to the reason for hope in life, you will think better, deeper and more about God after watching these messages.",1355011200,,425,4.532467532467533

3774143,5,B001R7IH5A,"Incredibly great price considering there are 4 cd's in the package. Loui Guiglio is one of my favorite preachers, the passionate way he talks about God and His word inspires me. The first talk I heard from him was HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD and I loved it, then it led me to see INDESCRIBABLE and I loved that one too. Those two talks plus another two in the same package and that cheap? I had to buy it!!!",1347926400,,400,4.075949367088608
3774144,5,B001R7IH5A,The Louie Giglio: The Heart of Passion dvd's are a great resource to learn more about creation. He creates great pictures to put in our mind and share with others,1347494400,,162,4.433333333333334
3774145,5,B001R7IH5A,I run a small group and am always looking for great resources.  This DVD series was wonderful.  Although this series was really meant to target college age kids it definately crosses age barriers.  My groups age range is from mid 30's to 80's and everyone thorougly enjoyed it.  Louis is funny and has a great way of using astronomy and logic in a Christ centered teaching.  The DVD set came with questions for review.  Everyone in our group thoroughly loved the dvd and are excited about showing it to extended family.  Thanks Louis for a great series!,1346025600,,553,4.639175257731959

He holds the universe together. Jesus Christ is the truth, the way and the life!",1344124800,,433,4.493670886075949
3774148,5,B001R7IH5A,"Louie Giglio has used his skills to portray the wonders of the Universe we live in so well, that it's amazing that humans with only
10% usage of their brain capacity, can  not think that a designer with 100% capacity of thought, knowledge and wisdom has placed us here for a purpose? Someone who wrote the laws we call science, someone who is the greatest source of knowledge
and yet someone that so few people will get to meet and learn from?",1342742400,,443,4.402439024390244
3774149,5,B001R7IH5A,"This is without a doubt the most powerful, inspirational DVDs I have ever watched.  Although meant for young adults primarily, Lou Giglio speaks to all ages with a passion that reaches each heart.  Not only have my husband and I bought the set for ourselves, but have bought his DVDs as gifts for our adult children and friends.  They speak of the power and grace of God in a way that speaks to Christians and non-Christians alike.  Two of these DVDs show in detail the remarkable creation of God using science...Indescribable and How Great is Our God.  I want to share this set with my whole world and they make a great witnessing tool.  One never tires of watching them and each time I absorb more of the content and end by worshiping the One who truly loves me.  I recommend them to everyone, young and old.

I have appreciated Giglio's teaching, and have used it a number of times as illustrative tools as I teach youth.

3774175,5,B001R7IH5A,Wow! Wow! Wow!  These series of dvd's are amazing.  Mr. Giglio is passionate about his christian faith and communicates it in a very clear fashion.  He uses science and breaks it down to a language we can understad to show how the fingerprint of God is in His creation; he also uses real life testimonies of others to show how God is at work in our lives even when we don't think He seems to care or is involved in our lives.  Great as a witnessing tool and faith building tool for those of us who already belive.,1329868800,,513,4.204081632653061

My wife and I are Christians and Louie's videos completely rocked our world, and enhanced our resolve more than can be expressed.

The talks build in layers, so are terrific shown in order, but even viewed separately are terrific.  This is great for Bible study groups, Sunday school classes, and campus ministries.  The group being addressed in the video is around college age, but this can be used and thoroughly enjoyed by high school and older.  Helps people see that in good times and in the worst of times, God is faithful and is closer than our breath.  Interesting series to show to people who love astronomy--very fascinating look at the ""known universe"".  Can be shown over a 6-8 week time period.

I teach a class of Juniors at our church, and both times I've shown one of the 4 DVD's, I end up with a HUGE class - double or triple the usual group.  This man takes subjects that are difficult to understand, like how GREAT is our God, or how incredibly vast the universe is, and puts them into concrete terms.  Then he goes the opposite direction and shows how this God that is so HUGE, cares about the tiniest details by showing you incredible designs at the cellular level.  Wonderful set of DVDs.

I watched the whole series and have since then lent it to a friend who has been on he fence to living her life for Christ. Louie has been a part of her life everyday since she borrowed them and yesterday she finally accepted my gift of a Bible as she has never owned one. God works through Louie Giglio in magical ways that can only be explained as the Holy Spirit.

It really blew me away I was so WoWed by his Talks I have now seen all 4 and own them several times over because I have given away several of them and purchased like 20 or more for other people at Church and Campmeeting last year 2008 my personal favorite is How Great is our God! I wish everone could see this and just realize how Big our God is and how really Small we reall are. The Lord God wants us to know him and to really get to know him you have to have an experence of True Genuine Salvation. Louie tries to wow you to get you to look beyond your little problems and see that there is a God outthere that although he's bigger that anyone can even imagine yet he's small enough to live inside your heart. To have a Passion for Christ you must see his passion to realize how much God loves you he sent his only begotten Son Jesus to die on a cruel Cross the Cross of Calvary to purchase our redemption so you and I could really be Free So if the Son therefore shall make you FREE you shall be Free indeed! Not free to do what ever you want to do but to be free to live for God and give him the Glory honor the praise that he alone diserves he is worthy. Worthy is the lamb that was slain! Worthy is our God of all our praise! Thank you Jesus,1243728000,32,1368,3.8718861209964412

3774340,5,B001R7IH5A,"This collection of DVD's from the Passion Talks, is truly amazing.  The first two cover the enormity of God.  It's something we don't typically think about on a daily basis.  But, He is HUGE!  And these talks, help put that into better perspective.  I would recommend buying this collection for the first two DVD's alone.  They're all great!  But, the first two make the whole collection well worth your while and cost!",1241136000,,419,4.736111111111111

Every high school and college student (and all adults) should watch these. And if you can get your hands on Duane's ""Solomon's top 30"", based on the 30 top sayings of King Solomon in the book of Proverbs, you will listen to it over and over.....",1498608000,,394,4.337837837837838
