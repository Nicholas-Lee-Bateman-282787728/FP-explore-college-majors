Unfortunately, this episode spent half the time on earth showing the domestic issues that a couple people had.",1292457600,,227,4.159090909090909
4138992,5,B003L77GVK,As much as I love this series the buyer should be aware that Amazon is slow in downloading the videos where you buy a season pass.  If you want it fast you should choose ITunes.  They are quicker.,1290556800,4,196,4.131578947368421
4138993,5,B003L77GVK,"stargate universe is a great new look into the universe of stargate. I love sg-1 and sga, but this new show is so much more real. so much in depth with not only all the character devlopment, but with telling a great stargate story. There were two episodes from last season that litterally made me cry. No tv show has ever made that happen. And the fact that they were tears of joy and woo hoos is even beter. I suggest SGU to anyone who loves stargate, sci-fi, and compeling  storytelling. Plus the #1 greatest space adventure of all time",1290470400,3,538,4.38
4138994,4,B003L77GVK,"Overall I thought this episode was fairly good. I thought ""Cloverdale"" was a slick gloss on the name&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>. It brought back memories of monsters not seen until late in the story and of the video taping by one of the characters. This episode further develops Chloe's transformation into...who knows what, while tying her and Matt closer together. What I didn't get was whether Chloe's transfusion also furthers her(her host's ?) agenda toward delivering the Destiny over to previously shown aliens. The complexity of her and Dr. Rush's relationship adds a subtle undercurrent of suspense as well. I wonder what the writers have next in mind. Will Chloe and Matt really get married? Does the shared blood mean that they will both be transformed into some sort of human/alien hybrid? Will this cause the Colonel to stop trusting one of his right hand men? There is certainly enough material here to keep me watching.",1288742400,2,1051,5.743589743589744

4139177,2,B003L77GVK,It seems like a half baked production. The quality seems a lot lower than SG-1 and Atlantis. Not sure what they were thinking but definitely not Star Gate I was used to.,1500768000,,169,4.3125

4139181,5,B003L77GVK,"Interesting and exciting series.  The complexity of the stories and characters kept me interested.  Robert CarlyIe is always interesting to watch. I 'm so sorry that there was not a season 3 or a movie.  All the actors have moved on to other jobs but it would be so interesting to see the crew come out in another galaxy and to learn what happened.  The ability to have a planet to dial the ninth chevron to the Destiny may have been solved,  I wonder if Eli got a pod up and running or did he just port his personality into the Destiny through the chair.  Wish the Stargate production apparatus would bring back the series or a few movies even though I'm sure the production overhead is high  ( but if SyFy can do the Expanse or Dark Matter why not this series),  Maybe when Robert Carlyle has a break from Once Upon a Time.  My favorite episodes are the first couple because of the surprise and the introduction of the characters.  Sorry that after the Season 2 episode Epilogue the producers dropped the storyline and characters of the ancestors to the second Destiny crew.  I wonder what happened to them.",1496793600,2,1109,4.467661691542289

4139340,4,B003L77GVK,"Worth the time and money.  Great to catch up and even see bits that I had forgotten about or never seen.  The ending was kind of up in the air due to the non existent Season 3 [the rumor mill had lots of interesting things that could happen].  With Eli smiling at the very end it leaves MANY possibilities, some very cool, some kind of Machiavellian, some, well use your imagination.  In the final tally there were many interesting episodes and many soap opera episodes.  It might have been the soap opera's that finally nailed the coffin.  Personally I would have loved to see Season 3 come to fruition, just to see what does happen to Destiny and the crew a few years to hundreds of years later.  The plot twists are endless, making them work is always the problem.  A few years leaves the present SGA in the picture, hundreds of years does not, but hundreds of years allows scenarios to be able to change lots of things, kind of a Deus ex machina escape clause to a conundrum.  Waiting for a movie or two to show us where SGU would have gone..",1484179200,2,1046,4.350515463917525
4139341,5,B003L77GVK,"This series was far better than the original stargate series (and better than the Atlantis series, too).  The characters and the plot were far more serious and unpredictable,  The series was too short-lived and more episodes should have been produced.",1484092800,3,251,5.25

The casting didn't work as well this time around, the storylines were full of holes and choppy, and most characters didn't have good chemistry together. A few episodes were good, but not really a series I would recommend.

4139481,4,B003L77GVK,"I had a family member buy this for me as a gift.  When I opened the box I was initially happy to have the 2nd season which I hadn't bought yet.  Till I looked at the box and realized that it was merely the DVD box set.

Thankfully they included a gift receipt and i promptly returned the DVD season 2 set got their money back. Since SGU:S2 was aired in HD, I EXPECT that the content I buy on physical media is also in 1080p, or at the minimum 1080i if that was as good as it got.

That MGM would even release a DVD only set of an HD production is a sham.  They wonder why sales of this season are low?  Its because we won't purchased crappy DVD versions of HD programming. I don't care about specials, or extras.  I just want the episodes, in all their HD. And until MGM releases the bluray version of season 2, I refused to purchase it.

This is the same reason why I held off on purchasing iZombie season 2 when they didn't have an announced bluray set.  No Bluray?  No CARE.

I still gave this 4 stars because SGU itself was an excellent effort in the 2nd season even though it was not as mainstream as SG1, and SGA was.  I still enjoyed the show.",1480032000,,1150,4.039823008849558

4139483,4,B003L77GVK,"I may be in the minority, but this was my favorite Stargate show. It was a little more gritty than the first to shows and a lot more dramatic. I like that. Season 2 to me was just as good as season 1. I thought all the actors were great in their role. The only criticism I have for this Season is, they should have explained more how the ship can get in your head. Still I'm a fan.",1477872000,3,381,3.8354430379746836
4139584,5,B003L77GVK,"I really liked the premise for this show.  It had so much potential, yet it was cancelled abruptly.  This season (season 2) was the last, yet this grouping in Prime does not complete the series (I think there were 4 more).  That was a disappointment, and apparently the last shows are not yet available via Prime.
There were some holes in the plot (why the other planets seem to have a breathable atmosphere, and the alien ships as well?)
I always wanted to see them explore the ship more and open up more wonders.
I loved David Blue in his role as Eli.",1477612800,2,553,4.349514563106796

Where are those shows like SG-U, BattleStar Glactica, Roots, War and Remembrance, etc? does any news network have 24/7 news  team cover first-hand worthy news worldwide live?

4141199,5,B003L77GVK,"My review will be of both season 1 and season 2 disc sets. You can't review one without the other as together they form one of the best Sci-fi TV shows in recent times. I will be using the same review for both.

I remember when Stargate Universe first came out in 2009. Hubby and I loved SG-1 and we  watched Atlantis but were not impressed. Right from the first episode of Universe we were enthralled.

Each episode was action packed with never a dull episode. The first season was character building and the second season followed with new and exciting story lines. I could see the possibility for several seasons coming but unfortunately the series was cancelled. Talk about a heart breaker.

Hubby and I never saw an episode again until the Comet channel started carrying Universe this summer. Watching these reruns made us want to purchase the two season DVD sets. They are currently available at less than $9 a season and I haven't found a deal better than that.

The first season is a six disc set while the second season is a five disc set. Hours upon hours of entertainment. Fall in love all over again with Stargate Universe. I can not recommend these two season sets enough!

The first season DVD set has over 2 hours of Special Features plus commentaries on each episode. Included are the Kino video diaries, chatting with the cast featurettes and extended version of the season premiere episode ""Air"" and more!

The second and final season has interviews with the cast of SG-U, behind the scenes featurettes including Deconstructing Destiny, audio commentary by cast and producers on all episodes, Pitches: A Journey of Friendship and Discovery and Behind the Season 2 finale - Gauntlet and more!

These two season DVD sets are a must have for your collection!",1471046400,8,1773,4.733766233766234

Me and my wife actually got quite sad during the very last episode....especially knowing that the full arc of the show will never be resolved...we have grown quite close to the characters so this says a lot about the show...it was about people and how they react / interact with situations and others...again if you liked BSG...you will like this...why is it that every time a good, deep thought provoking show comes to light it gets pulled from air too soon ???....uhhhhh....well, there is a petition running around to bring it back...at least for one more season but that is just a dream...but one can dream, right? ;-)",1469491200,,734,4.833333333333333

 The ideas of the writers were really bringing SGU into it's own.
Most fans will say they want it to come back and blame sci fi channel for its demise.
Rumors are flying around of a STARGATE reboot...well everything else has one, so why not!!
This is basically something any stargate fan should like just put a darker twist on it.
One could say that this is to Stargate what Voyager is to Star Trek.",1469318400,,470,4.340909090909091
4141537,5,B003L77GVK,Great show,1469232000,,10,4.5
4141538,5,B003L77GVK,"Having watched SGU S1 & S2 in a week I must say that S2 is a great improvement over season 1. Yes Young's weakness as a Col is still there (how he got that rank is surprising ex: if you are looking for Rush episode after episode maybe send someone (or a Kino) to follow him) but all the strengths of S1 are here with less of the weaknesses making S2 that much better. Once Rush and Young start to be on the same page this show really takes off. The true mission of Destiny is pretty cool and the main baddies are pretty interesting.

A couple of things that stood out for me on this season are: (1) how close the crew got. You really get a sense of camaraderie (2) the storyline with an alt-path for Destiny's crew and how they kept it going was captivating and really well done. Star Trek has their Mirror universe and SGU has their alt-path for Destiny which I would have loved to have seen more of.

SGU was cancelled but they show still managed to make an fitting ending that left me wanting more. The finale was very well done and again you can see how close the cast and their characters got during the two years. I was (and am still) pretty sad to let the show/cast go 1-2 days after finishing the show.

Packaging: 5 discs in a pretty slim case (like Season 1) that should not take too much space on your shelf.

Other notes: I really wish the show would have been able to have another season but then again 3 years have almost gone by since it has been off the air so it is the perfect time for them to pick up where it left off :)

SGU was a great show so if you are reading this review pick-up season 1 & 2 because you will not regret it! $30 for about 40 episodes is a great price and you will have a blast watching the show!

Worth The Money: Yes
Would I Recommend It: Yes

4142843,4,B003L77GVK,"If you made it through season 1, then you'll be happy with season 2.  There's a bit more cooperation between the characters (eventually) and we see more plots involving alien tech and attacks and even some time travel twists as the season moves along.  These episodes were just easier to watch- maybe because season 1 is behind us or because I was reminded more of SG1 and Atlantis in some of these episodes.  You'll have to suspend some reason as TJ (the medic) performs a kidney transplant, but overall this season was enjoyable.  The ending leaves you wondering what will happen and a movie later on (like they did with the SG1 series) might have been nice, but at least they did wrap the ending up enough to not make you mad.",1465862400,,729,4.5

They turn on each other and everyone they meet but collectively live on despite all the disasters that confront them. They are improbably rescued from their failures time after time.  A soap opera set in space.

Thanks to Netflix, a second time through the series without commercials allows for binge watching of closely related episodes without the long breaks imposed by the original network screening. It is much easier to follow the story line without having to rehash what has gone on in previous episodes. Skipping the ""previously on"" and ""intro"" sections allows for a more coherent viewing experience.",1465257600,,675,5.127272727272727

I think it  is, without a doubt, the most interesting topic for TV and movies in general.  It is the by far the most awe inspiring thing humans have ever done - going to the moon, exploring Mars, the Hubble, actively looking for Goldilocks planets, etc.  This series went above and beyond in the ""what if"" department and loaded it up with wonderfully rich characters, fabulous writing, and a by far the most imagination I've ever seen in a TV series.  So my advice for anyone who is considering watching it - just watch Season 1, Episode 1. It's only about 45 mins out of your day and I'm willing to be you'll be binge watching before you know it.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Universe-Season-1/dp/B002UWH8P6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Universe Season 1</a>",1464912000,,961,5.248366013071895

I like both shows, and it's nice to have a variety.  Brad Wright and Robert Cooper are amazing talents and did an excellent job with the Stargate franchise.  The only thing I didn't really like were ""the stones"", but I understand the need for a device to communicate for story purposes, they just seemed so weird and awkward. The characters were great and the acting was top notch, especially Alaina Huffman; she was very impressive.",1462406400,,590,4.811881188118812

4144954,5,B003L77GVK,"In this second season, SGU really took off. Multi-layered characters with gripping stories, drama and danger and derring-do in heart-stoppingly beautiful outer space settings. Characters and stories seemed to gel...to find their feet...and by the final episode, and the final, breathtaking scene, I was completely hooked and just wanted the voyage to go on for at least a third season, and hopefully more. I know the cancellation was a financial decision, but I think this series was bound to take off and become more popular, as it had improved so much. I am a little late to the game in terms of SGU, as I was to Firefly--but in both cases simply could not believe that those two fine, unique, beyond impressive shows had been cancelled. It seems to me that the Sy-fy (why not Sci-fi, for goodness sake?) channel has little to no respect for their viewers...or for quality television. I echo others in saying that I hope the story of the Destiny and her crew is continued and wound up in a novel, if a movie or new TV series is not going to be possible. I feel that I just began to know the characters, and they are gone.",1459123200,,1123,4.564356435643564
4144955,5,B003L77GVK,"Season 2 obviously starts with a bang and keeps building up from there.  More danger, adventure and peril for the crew of DESTINY. The writing does not falter and the action and mystery come on strong. You would think they've been stranded on this ship for 5 years considering everything they've been put through.  The characters are developed better and  storylines get more entwined as the season progresses. Nothing is lacking in the final season and you will be left wanting more.

4144957,5,B003L77GVK,"Wow. I was very critical of Stargate tv series for the fact that everyone they meet from space speaks English. Even those from another galaxy. And everyone looks just like white Americans from Hollywood. But this one really is different. It is edgy like the remake of Battlestar Gallactica, (the newer one with Edward James Olmos.) It's biggest weakness is that you have to know something about the Stargate Franchise in order to follow this show. You don't have to watch every episode but it helps to know the basic premise of the show and some of the history it has been through.

They do encounter aliens, but the aliens don't look at all human, and they don't speak at all; at least they do not speak the way we do, it is more like clicks and chirps and other sounds. Also, everyone on the crew is not exactly friends with each other, and there are different factions such as civilians, scientists, and military. They ended up together on this ship by accident not by choice. They all just want to get back to earth, but they soon realize they really need to figure out how to stay alive. Finding food and water resources is a challenge.

Of all the Stargate Series this one is by far the best written and the most interesting.",1458345600,6,1231,4.491071428571429
4144958,5,B003L77GVK,"A great season following an excellent first season. With breath-taking twists in every episode, this season never ceases to please.

I would have loved to see more of Stargate Universe.",1458259200,,342,4.913793103448276
4144959,5,B003L77GVK,"I was extremely sad and upset when they canceled Stargate Universe.  After many years I have finally rewatched the series in its entirety.  This unique and special series creation has held up well throughout the years.  Remarkably, even the ending of the second season lent itself to creating a gap in time prior to a return of this series.  With the exception of Robert Carlyle, as far as I know the actors involved have not gone on to greater things that would keep them from returning to the series.  Robert Carlyle currently stars in Once Upon a Time, but that series is nearly it's end as well.  I think it's time to reinvestigate bringing back Stargate Universe with its original crew.  Whether it took three years or 1000 years, I think bringing back this entire crew is critical.  You know many years ago they made the mistake of canceling Gilligans Island.  That show ran in syndication and still runs in syndication today to a very popular audience which wasn't present at the time of its cancellation.  Star Trek was canceled too, but then reborn as a very profitable family of spinoffs.  In fact, they are now reviving Star Trek yet again.  I think it's time to consider reviving Stargate Universe.  I believe a Stargate Universe movie could do WONDERS  in either reviving the series or creating a number of incredible movies about what happened.  It sure would be an improvement over the never ending Sharknado movies.  Even Farscape and Firefly had their own movies or follow ups.  SGU deserves the same.",1458259200,6,1518,4.754789272030651

4145075,1,B003L77GVK,"Based solely off of the Actors performances, the writers creativity, and the originality, I would have given this series a 4 star review.
However, yet again another director / producer combination decided to ruin the entire series, by instructing the cameraman to shake the camera relentlessly throughout the entire series of 40 or more episodes.

  A 10 year old child, with a ""fit in you palm, 200$ walmart  HD video recorder"". Could have done at least as good as the camera work in this series. The child would probably be steadier. Until Hollywood gets it through there think skulls that nobody wants to watch ANYTHING with the screen bobbling all over the place. The i will continue to give the worse possible reviews, for there worthless efforts of trying to use a camera properly.

  A person with end stages, advanced Parkinson's disease, would have been a steadier cameraman, than the filming done in this series . . .",1457827200,,927,4.829113924050633

4145308,5,B003L77GVK,"When I saw Stargate Universe series for the first time it was two years ago. Actually, it was for the first time I saw a Stargate series. I didn't know nothing about Sg-1, Atlantis and the other movies. Maybe that is because I was born in '96, one year before everything started. Anyway, now I'm aware of everything. Yet the first Stargate series I saw was SGU and I didn't know nothing about Syfy's cancellation of the show. I remember that immediatly after finishing watching season 2 I started looking after the next season and when I found nothing I began to worry and ask myself many questions. It was then that I discovered about SG-1&Atlantis's existence. But I felt so sorry about SGU. I've never watched a tv show that was ended prematurely. Stargate Universe was my first experience of this sort and I was shocked. I never thought that something like this could even happen. But now I realize that the tv show's industry is about money. Anyway, it was tragic. But honestly SGU was good stuff. It's my favourite TV series ever. The story it's amazing. It would have been awesome to see Dr. Rush solving the mystery behind the evidence of the intelligent structure from the Big Bang explosion. Does God really exists? Is immortality/ascending a reality? Maybe afterlife?It would have been nice to see col. Young leading the ship&crew and it would have been funny to watch master sergent Greer. I do not rate this tv show five stars because of hypocrisy, just because I would like to see SGU coming back on screens. I do it because it deserves it. And also it deserves a second chance. I do not believe that we can say with certainty that SG-1 and Atlantis were better than SGU. I consider all of these great. After I saw there is no season 3 I watched the other Stargate series and it was fine. They all are great, ok? So stop complaining about this better and this should be given a second chance. Stargate Universe deserves this firstly because the story was not finished, like the others. Money was a dead point and it caused a disaster. But who knows? Pandora's box still has hope left. In the end it would have been even better if I didn't know nothing about Stargate Universe. I would not want somebody else experience what I did.",1457222400,,2244,4.556930693069307

At first I was taken aback by the overt Battlestar Galactica feel (and I did NOT like BSG) and the numerous flashbacks as SGU scrambled to set the scene, however I toughed through Season 1 and lo and behold, Season 2 rewarded my patience. Season 2 retains the newfound focus, grit and dark tone of SGU, dials back the BSGness and remembers it is still part of Stargate. While the over-use of musical outros was slightly annoying, the show was actually moving along and getting good. I can see how SGU would have tested poorly among fans of Stargate's old guard, but SGU had plenty of strength to become its own series as a new twist on the rich established stargate lore, and if the geniuses at Syfy had just given it a chance it could have been something more.

4146624,3,B003L77GVK,"I really didn't dig this when i first tried it. It wasn't what i was used to expecting from the SG franchise and i'd probably given myself fatigue from watching too much from the Digibeta library at work.
 It looked weird, Bob Carlisle was always yelling and the millennial guy, Eli, began as a frustratingly two-dimensional trope.
Fast forward a few years: there's not much worth watching on Amazon Prime and i can binge-watch this for free and i find myself pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this is in lieu of nothing better.
It's competent on many levels but worthy of note is the soundtrack and score.
I think the sound is often neglected in production - people love to focus on the visuals but a bad soundtrack will wreck the show regardless of how good your cast and crew make the pictures. - i'm looking at you Mad Max - Fury Road.
Occasionally a musical montage will undermine this praise but a futuristic tale needs a strong futuristic synth score to give it an identity and fortunately the SGU team were smart enough to realize this.

It's a pity there were not more of these made but i understand the series may have run its course with 2 seasons of up to 18 episodes each 40 mins long.. Compare that to British shows which often get 6x30 minute shows per season and this starts to look a lot more generous.

I'm actually happy that this was cut off at Season2 - for a series that begins with a limited number of people trapped in a ship under regular attack and with no means of resupply there is only so far you can go before new blood is required to replace the lost crew. The ship itself becomes a plot liability since it's unreasonable to expect a reset to normal after every skirmish and hostile encounter - eventually something will be needed to rejuvenate the vessel and that's hard to do without setting jaded viewers eyes rolling.

I find myself wondering how SG atlantis made it to season 5.. i couldn't bear to watch past the pilot.",1452902400,,1960,4.481792717086835

4146698,4,B003L77GVK,"I was never a fan of the earlier Stargate series; in fact, I found the first one virtually unwatchable.  So I approached SGU with considerable skepticism.  But I have found that some solid writing, good direction, and downright excellent acting really deliver on the promise of the intriguing and rich premise.  The show tackles some very real and complicated issues head-on, as well as having fun with edgy science.  They also handle the question of what contact with alien intelligence might really be like with unusual thoughtfulness.  But perhaps my favorite aspect of the series is that it is completely unafraid to allow its characters to grow, change, and adapt to the simultaneously claustrophobic and expansive situation in which they find themselves.  As well as being much more engaging for the viewer, this also allows the actors room to stretch themselves and engage more deeply with their characters, and the results are entertainingly evident.  It's a sad comment on the state of the current audience for science fiction television that this series only lasted two years, while the putrid original went on for what seems like decades.",1449446400,2,1149,5.112299465240642

4147112,5,B003L77GVK,"This is the best of STARGATE series of them all. Intelligent, witty, deep and creative. The casting was perfection and acting outstanding. Only two seasons left us fans disappointed. There were many years to explore the characters and galactic adventures.

I have tried watching all other Stargate series but was left with corny dialog, weak storylines, superficial characters, mediocre acting and just plain bored but SGU is a whole new level of brilliant writing, acting with deep characters and storylines that kept me up to 5 in the morning needing to watch the next episode on Netflix because it was such a compelling show I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.
This show is not light or fluffy. It takes a psychological look at most of the characters on the ship and creates an emotional attachment to their personal stories that is emotional moving.  The character played by Ming Na is most irritating as she is for me in most of her roles on TV but if you can stomach her a little the show is just fantastic.

The final season is pretty much tied up but still left us hanging as to what happens to all the characters and in this they also left a huge opening for the show to be picked up at anytime in the future no matter how much the actors age it could still be logically explained.

I just can't get enough of SGU. I love smart Sci Fi and this is one of them.

I can best compare Stargate SGU to all the other previous Stargate shows to James Bond films. Up until the Daniel Craig era, there were somewhat silly characters, storylines, gadgets and goofey one liners and then when Daniel Craig version of 007 hit theaters, it was a whole new level of intelligent characters, writing and storylines.  SGU is the modern day Stargate that rises above and beyond all other Stargates.",1447459200,15,1799,4.554179566563468
4147113,3,B003L77GVK,"I wanted to love this, and while I loved SG ATlantis, I was disappointed with Stargate Universe.  Maybe I'm old fashioned, but I like characters I can root for (those I would ally with if I were with them), but there was so much whining and complaining and back stabbing, that I got turned off by this.  Rush (who seemed to be the scientist in charge) felt more like a MAD scientist, and left me wanting to jump ship!  When he was left behind on the planet by Young, I was hopeful that the series might go in a direction I wanted to watch, but when I saw he came back to the series, I lost interest.  There was also very little space exploring and I expected more.  Maybe it would have gotten better, but it wasn't what I was looking for in my sci fi interests.",1447372800,,761,4.149659863945578

This series has only one flaw; it was not continued to a logical conclusion.  The quality of the character development was outstanding, and is the primary requirement of good SF.  The actors were excellent as where the production values.  Now, if only someone could continue the series or possibly create a movie, it would be wonderful.  What a mistake it was not to continue SGU.  Please use the same actors if possible when the time comes for renewal, I am an optimist and  really love good SF.",1447286400,,611,4.635514018691588

I wish the networks would learn from past mistakes, meaning that Sci-fi fans are very discerning people and it takes them time to commit to a story arc or writing style. But once you have us, we can be exceptional loyal (and rabid). I've been to several sci-fi conversations over the years and the same complaints are repeated over and over.

This series is darker. More like Deep Space 9. Our guys are a bunch of people tossed in to a situation who were not the people one would have chosen. Motivations are more complex. Some of our guys are down right dangerous to others.

I wonder if this was the writers looking for a way to do stories they would have liked but would not fit in the other series.

Overall effective. Not great art but compeling enough that we watched them all.",1443225600,,605,4.383928571428571

There were interesting twists and turns, and very unexpected events. These turned out to be on a par with some of the better SciFi we've seen in other series.

There were more new faces on SGU and just as many big name actors as the SG-1 series had.  These naysayers must have been in love with Richard D Anderson and Amanda Tapping!

4148512,4,B003L77GVK,"This is by far the best of the Stargate franchise. Gone are the archetypal characters that don't exist in real life. People who crack one-liners with guns to their heads. People who always get through the situation no matter the odds and yet for some odd reason viewers still worry for their safety. Instead, they are replaced by highly trained, talented people who have personal issues like anyone else. People who let these issues cloud their judgement. People who are just doing their best with the situation at hand who in the end will often surprise you and ultimately pull through. That's what real heroism is. Every issue that they face isn't the end of the world or the universe as we know it. And most importantly, gone is the universe where every alien species is completely fluent in the English language.

I like that I can relate to this group of people travelling through space. The issues they face are real. Space inherently does not want people -- it is inhospitable. Every basic thing that we take for granted becomes a necessity that doesn't exist in space -- air, water, food, heat. It is not luxurious to travel through space, it involves hardship and sacrifice. The fact that these are real people dealing with real issues makes this the one show about space travel that I can most relate to. These people aren't all going to make it through, because they are real people facing real danger. I can most easily picture myself being there with people who are as flawed as I am, no matter how talented they are. (I would have pursued a career in space travel and actually did into college, if not for the simple issue of bad myopia that left me unqualified) A lot of people complain about the first few episodes, but I feel that these are the best ones. My favorite episode of the series is ""Time"". Most time travel episodes of any show multiply exponentially a number of story inconsistencies, but this one kept things relatively simple and plausible. I especially loved how this episode, and this show in general, assumes that the viewer is intelligent and didn't try to dumb it down. At the end of the episode, it was obvious to extrapolate the storyline as to what happens next. They didn't need to show us or explain it to us. There is one minor issue I always wonder about though, when they would have reached the planet in the third timeline, would there have been one kino or two?

This show becomes weaker when they introduce elements from the original Stargate franchise. I was OK with the communication stones, although I wish they would show the actual people being replaced acting like the characters replacing them. Using the actual characters takes away the point of view from the people around them, and also makes us forget that these characters are using other people's bodies. Would you be OK with someone using your body to have sex with another person or having sex with someone you love, but they are in a coworkers body? As an example, when Colonel Young switched to an alien's body, he would have realized it as soon as he looked at his hands. That's hard to convey when they are showing actor Louis Ferreira instead. Also, everyone always transfers to someone of the same sex. How are they certain of which sex everyone is on each side and who touches which stone to match the other person? Plus they should have been using these stones full time to bring over experts from Earth to help on board and to train Destiny's crew to be more effective while they were sent to Earth. The show weakened greatly when they introduced the Lucian Alliance. (Again with the fluent in English aliens? Also, apparently commander Kiva must have been a part of some Lucian Alliance student exchange program with Cambridge or Oxford?) Then there is Simeon, who is as undefeatable as the Terminator, who in any sense of reality would be no match for special ops forces. If you think about it, the Lucian alliance equivalent in the real world today would be any of our current terrorist organizations. Pick one.

My personal pick, though, for the weakest element in this show is the indie acoustic rock montages. This is a show about professional adults travelling in space, not a CW show about teen angst. I mostly end up fast forwarding through these parts, and thank god they eventually disappeared from the show. Some of the ways the characters act toward each other come across as juvenile, but then again, sadly, people can be that juvenile. The plot lines are written pretty tight. It wasn't until rewatching a third time that I saw Spencer covertly pocketing power bars in one of the first few episodes. Several episodes later he was confronted over them when he claimed that he had them when they went through the gate. Also, when Lt James couldn't handle Amanda Perry's body and pulled away and forgot to wipe the stone, this allowed the aliens to take over her to sabotage the ship which then allowed the stranded party to return. These are a lot of small plot details that all come together to allow more complex things to happen without seeming contrived at all. I applaud the writers on that standpoint. Another big complaint I have about the SG franchise in general is the unoriginality of how their three series structures too closely mirror the Star Trek franchise (SG - NG, Atlantis - DS9, SGU - Voyager).

My biggest complaint however, is for the extremely overly vocal minority of SG fanboys who were probably the greatest contribution to torpedoing this series before its time. They complained about this Stargate, and so now there is no more Stargate -- I hope they're happy now. I still want a season three and beyond.",1439856000,,5665,4.679037111334002

4148985,4,B003L77GVK,"This show is much more gripping than I expected from the first few episodes, and the visuals are amazing.  Watch the first five episodes and then decide.  The main characters are trapped aboard a ship that is somewhere in-between a giant Millennium Falcon and the ship on Alien.  Somehow they manage to learn how to control it instead of endlessly jumping through space based on its pre-programming by the all-knowing all-powerful ""Ancients"".  What took me time to adjust to is that there are only two people in this space drama who are as pure of heart as any of the crew members in any Star Trek episode or the heroic teams of Star Gate SG1 and Star Gate Atlantis.  The rest are messy, conflicted, self-centered, sometimes devious and sometimes even murderous.  One central character, Dr. Rush, is a megalomaniac who wants to carry out what he sees as the ship's true mission -- discovering the meaning of the universe.  I won't spoil the ending because I haven't seen it yet.",1436745600,,978,4.7176470588235295

4149303,5,B003L77GVK,Stargate Universe is a very well acted well written TV program. It is too bad that it wasn't appreciated while it was on the air.

4149308,4,B003L77GVK,"Stargate Universe was not as popular among Stargate fans as the other spinoffs.  This, plus having its broadcast schedule moved around constantly by its US network, doomed the program.  Personally, I like Universe better than the other renditions of Stargate franchise.  It is a much darker program that looks more deeply into the conflicts and relationships among crew members - and outsiders.  The final episode does a very good job of warping up a series that was cancelled to soon - and it does so in a manner that both is satisfying as a true last episode while holding out hope for a movie or revival on another network.",1434326400,,626,4.715596330275229

The story slowly creeps up on you, but once it takes hold it is hard to ignore it. I found myself watching four or five episodes a night this past week. In thinking over the pros and cons, I realize now that I took the amazing special effects for granted. (especially given this is a tv series from a few years ago) Yes, there were some corny scenarios, but I was still caught up in it...and the characters were SO well developed that I honestly grew to care about some of them that I thought I didn't even like at first.

This is a stellar cast with well written episodes. I can't fathom any reason WHY syfy would cancel this, other than some sort of stupid industry politics. It seems as if the good shows are always the ones dropped, while the useless smut continues. PLEASE give us fans some sort of closure.

4149376,4,B003L77GVK,"Stargate SGU was finally finding it's groove through season 2, revealing a depth of characters we hadn't seen before in SG1 and Stargate Atlantis.  Its grittier, more dramatic tone and slow build through the first season put a lot of people off, but I was intrigued by the tease of the central premise, that the ship Destiny's mission was to find the source of all life.  Robert Carlyle had found a slightly more sympathetic tone in the key character of Nicholas Rush.  The rest of the cast had found nuances in their characters as well, and some of the storylines were a bit more reminiscent of SG1 or Atlantis in terms of action and camaraderie.  It was beginning to explore creation themes that movies like Ridley Scott's Prometheus tried in vain to make work.  SGU had found a tone that wasn't as heroic as SG1 or goofy as Atlantis often was, and I hate that it was so unceremoniously cancelled by SyFy, which apparently thought pro wrestling and ghost shows were more profitable.  Season 2, and the series itself, ended abruptly on a bittersweet note with quite an existential conundrum.  There are rumblings of a new stab at the Stargate universe, both in television and in the movies (Dean Devlin, co-creator of the original film, has spoken of a new movie trilogy that would basically ignore 15 years of SG television canon).

4149478,3,B003L77GVK,"SGU is good, but its not as good as SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis. I think the producers tried to ride the franchise popularity, yet neglected some key elements that made it so popular. Biggest difference, the cast composition.  Actors were great,  but in both SG-1 and SGA, you had that tight knit team, with a strong supporting cast, and lets not forget the amazing witty dialogue. SGA seemed so cumbersome because the story played out through so many different people. The story is excellent, but the scope of the storytelling made it... suck. Bottom line, if you like the franchise youll like the series because Stargate is awesome. If your hoping to see the next O'Neill/Sheppard, Carter/McKay, Teal'c/Ronan, Jackson/Teyla, your going to be disappointed.  I've watched the episodes (and own the dvds) of SG-1, and SGA many many times, I've never rewatched SGU.",1433203200,,861,5.006993006993007

4149538,5,B003L77GVK,"I regretted that the series ended so quickly.  It was seeming like it had finally found its rhythm.  I had my own ideas as to how it could develop.  The last episode hinted that perhaps the show would be back in three years, the time it would take for Destiny to reach the other galaxy.
  It is clear that the ""ascended"" beings who designed Destiny are not 100% out of the picture, so I would have loved to see more conscious interaction between them and the crew of Destiny, even to the point where it becomes clear that the ""ascended"" ones actually NEED the Destiny crew to help them fulfill their own goal, and that, perhaps, they had evolved into energy beings too soon and were no longer able to do things in the physical universe which were needed for finding the source of the ""structure"" of the universe.
  Sometimes it seemed that one or another character was being a bit too blockheaded, given the time already spent on the ship.  Also, after years on the ship, it was mystifying that there was really anything left to explore.  It didn't seem all that ""human"" that people weren't exploring new areas of the ship every day.
  Further, setting up the opposite poles: 1) Rush for whom the mission is to go ever further, and 2) Everett for whom the mission is always to get home, became too strained.  There needed to be a meeting of the minds, both to relax the viewer, and to further the episodes.

  Still, I found this very stimulating to the imagination, which is why science fiction interests me.",1432944000,2,1509,4.4963235294117645

4149621,5,B003L77GVK,"(SOME SPOILERS) I've been a fan of the Stargate shows since the first episode of SG-1 aired. I watched all 10 seasons of Stargate SG-1 and all 5 seasons of Stargate Atlantis on a binge Around the time SGU aired, and I about do it again. I just finished watching SGU after not seeing a single Stargate episode since this one got cancelled. All I got to say is that I don't believe SGU would made it passed a 3rd season. The reason I believe this is that I notice that a few things happened just so the crew aboard Destiny would survive another episode. Like episode 9 of season 2, the people that was left back on another planet(Eden) back in season 1 just come back with no explanation with a fully restored shuttle after Destiny just lost their shuttle. I happy that we figured out what happened to the people left on Eden but to have them just come back (from the dead) and then die again in a similar fashion as they did on Eden in the same episode just seemed to convenient, I mean if they stayed a few episodes and died off in a similar fashion it would of not been a little bit more understanding. But all that happened was Destiny gained a shuttle, but no downsides. The same with episode 12 of season 2, a future Destiny travels back in time with only Dr. Rush to survive the ordeal and later kill a second Colonel Telford and die himself. All that basically happened was that Destiny gained another shuttle twice the ammo, food, parts, and other supplies they needed with no downsides. As for the drones they encountered, just a primitive version of the Replicators from SG-1. SGU was a great series despite all of that, and I am sad and aggravated that it is gone and wished it ended on something other than a big cliffhanger like it did.

(SPOILER FREE)TL;DR: The writers seemed like they where running out of ideas, Destiny crew seems really really lucky to survived as long as they did and despite all of that I really do love this series and all of Stargate, I just hope the movie reboot comes threw and isn't complete crap.",1432252800,,2038,4.37730870712401
