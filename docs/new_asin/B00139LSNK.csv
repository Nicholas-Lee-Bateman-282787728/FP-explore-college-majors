8249503,4,B00139LSNK,This is one whacked out movie. It definitely requires a few jack and cokes to be appreciated. It's got plenty of awkward unnecessary close ups of its old man lead. Drunk driving with a seal riding shotgun. Seals wandering the desert. Plenty of cheap jack songs too.  Somebody release a blu ray of this schlock classic.,1376784000,,318,4.678571428571429
8249504,4,B00139LSNK,A young Sarah Brown as Mary Ann knocks this thing out of the park and a Golden Globe-worthy moment from the seal climbing the hill make this worth the wait for a re-release!,1358121600,,173,4.2727272727272725
