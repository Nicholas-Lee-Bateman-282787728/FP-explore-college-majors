Nekea is a very professional instructor.  She doesn't have the jibber-jabber that some instructors have.  She has a pleasant voice and sounds very warm and friendly.  Her cueing is exceptional.  As I mentioned, I'm a seasoned fitness DVD lover; over 10 years.  I know my levels that challenge me and those that make me end up with a brain cramp.  Nekea's workout allows me to work my body without the pain of trying to figure out what she is doing and why her cues don't match.  Nothing can be more aggravating than an instructor who cues the move right as she/he is doing it.  Nekea cues before the move so you can continue to flow with the choreography, knowing exactly what's next.

Since this is a Greg Twombly production, you can expect the typical set and the rocking music.  Nekea stays on beat with her workout.  The 2 background exercisers and the setting do not distract your attention away from Nekea.

This DVD is sectioned off into a warm up with step, the stepping routine, then the kickboxing interval workout, next a Tai Chi quick cool down and finally ab work.  There are mix and match settings so you can pick out the pieces you want to do for any particular workout.

The kickboxing workout has great combinations.  However, I did have to get past the sloppy moves.  I didn't find that Nekea, or her crew, made crisp, tight punches and kicks.  Knowing some about form, I was able to keep myself in check.  But it is harder when your instructor doesn't follow through too good.  This is the only downside I see of this fitness DVD.  For the interval section, I used a lot heavier weights than Nekea does.  And her form with weights is very good.

This workout challenged me but didn't leave me wanting to throw my step at the TV.  I was worked out, not worked over.  It was a fun workout that I truly enjoyed.  It will be one that I happily add to my fitness DVD library.",1271548800,4,2045,4.412868632707775
8169037,2,B000MGUZW0,"I bought the other Nekea Brown DVD and I really liked it and found it challenging for a step DVD. This one...not so much. Now I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I really found the queuing and explanation of the moves to be difficult to follow on this one. Sometimes I don't get all the moves the first few times, but geez with this one, I've done it about 10 times and I'm still lost! Lost = bored = no sweat or increased heartrate! I move one to something else so that I could actually work out without having to rewind several times!",1262736000,,554,4.186915887850467
