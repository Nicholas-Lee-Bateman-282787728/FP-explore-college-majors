Far ahead of her time, Mae was the greatest blonde bombshell and sex symbol in film history and this set has most of her greatest classic films.  From her film debut in Night After Night with George Raft, to My Little Chickadee with W.C. Fields this is classic entertainment at its finest!  A great, fun, and vastly entertaining set starring the most classy, curvy, original, SUPER star of ALL time!  Nobody, but NOBODY, can top Mae West!",1464220800,3,514,4.806818181818182
7578727,5,B019OI2HJ0,"It's pure delight watching these old movies.  Mae West not only starred in these films but also wrote the screenplays.

Mae West was risque with class.  Every move she made, every word she spoke was done with style.  Every movie had a great plot and a happy ending.  And I got to hear her say, ""Peel me a grape, Beulah.""",1463443200,2,320,4.266666666666667
7578728,5,B019OI2HJ0,The Essential Collection contains a broad spectrum of Mae West's films displaying many of her most famous quotes.  The quality of the DVDs is very good considering what they had to work with.  Well worth the price.,1461715200,,214,4.756756756756757
7578729,5,B019OI2HJ0,"Always one of a kind was Mae. In revisiting these films, one can appreciate the talent and skill she had has an actress. Who would have thought she could sing part of an opera, or gospel or the blues?",1461283200,,200,4.153846153846154
7578730,5,B019OI2HJ0,"This is an awesome collection of all of Mae's early movies. Good for watching over and over again if you are a fan of the lady who could woo any man. She is a great writer, singer and actress, who wrote and produced most of the films.",1461110400,,234,4.0
7578731,4,B019OI2HJ0,"This certainly will give you an overview of Mae West's movies, but they have not been remastered, nor is there any additional historical material. though there is plenty to say about Mae and her influence on fashion, and on film censorship, to name but two. Her position as auteur -- she wrote the scripts, she acted, sang, and danced, she had final say about the director, costumes, music, and casting -- is unique, as far as I know, and has never been equaled by any star.
That said, this is a wonderfully entertaining collection, and includes not just the most famous of her films, but some of her (now) lesser known, but still impressive works. These include Goin' To Town, where she plays an heiress trying to crash high society, and has a scene where she sings a scene from Saint-Saens' opera Samson and Delilah in French; Go West, where she hilariously plays a spoiled movie star; Every Day
s a Holiday, in which she was gowned by Schiaparelli, and which opens with a meticulously recreated New Year's Eve, 1899. at the famous restaurant, Rector's, in New York City, and has a stellar cast including Edmund Lowe, Lloyd Nolan, Charles Butterwirth, Charles Winninger, and Louis Armstrong; and what is perhaps her most interesting film in many ways, Klondike Annie, where her adventures are almost serious, and she exhibits her skill at speaking Chinese and conducting a rousing revival sermon (not at the same time).",1460937600,25,1421,4.827868852459017
7578732,5,B019OI2HJ0,"Mae West was decades ahead of her time in her portrayal of many characters She wrote entire screenplays for some of the movies and it would appear that the more input she had the greater the movie was!
I have found a ""new love"" late in life! Mae West May you rest in peace!",1459468800,8,273,4.074074074074074
7578733,5,B019OI2HJ0,"My all-time favorite Mae West line [from 'Go West Young Man'] was mangled by the censor.
In the film she says,
""You may kiss my hand.
And tomorrow, perhaps you may kiss me.""
-- which doesn't even make sense.
It should have been:
""You may kiss my hand.
And tomorrow, perhaps, you may kiss the rest of me.""

In her prime, Mae West starred in ten films (1932-1943)
-- The first nine are conveniently gathered in this three DVD box from Universal.
-- The rights to the tenth film are owned by a different conglomerate, so you have to buy it separately.*
Back in 2006, Universal released five films in the ""Mae West Glamour Collection"".**
The remaining films were issued on Universal Vault Series DVD-Rs.
This new set is the first time all nine Paramount and Universal titles have been released on standard DVDs.
English SDH subtitles.

In this box:
1932 Night After Night -- George Raft, Constance Cummings [Paramount]
1933 She Done Him Wrong - CONDEMNED -- Cary Grant, Owen Moore [Paramount]
1933 I'm No Angel - CONDEMNED -- Cary Grant, Gregory Ratoff, Edward Arnold [Paramount]
1934 Belle of the Nineties - CONDEMNED -- Roger Pryor, Johnny Mack Brown [Paramount]
1935 Goin' to Town -- Paul Cavanagh, Gilbert Emery [Paramount]
1936 Klondike Annie -- Victor McLaglen, directed by  Raoul Walsh [Paramount]
1936 Go West, Young Man -- Warren William, Randolph Scott  [Paramount]
1937 Every Day's a Holiday -- Edmund Lowe, Charles Butterworth [Paramount]
1940 My Little Chickadee -- W.C. Fields, Joseph Calleia, Margaret Hamilton [Universal]

The three films from 1933 and 1934 were given the dreaded ""C"" rating: CONDEMNED by the Legion of Decency during it's first two years of operation.
1932's 'Night after Night' likely would have received a Condemned rating, but it was released a year before the Legion was formed
And was one of the reasons why the Legion was formed.
Roman Catholics were forbidden to see these films. ***
All four are presented in their original uncut form.
'Night after Night' was a George Raft gangster movie.
Mae plays one of his old girlfriends, a supporting part - This is the only time she did not receive top billing.
And it's the only time that Mae did not receive a writing credit, even though she wrote the best line in the film - ""Goodness had nothing to do with it"".

If you are new to Mae West,
the best place to start is with her second film, 'She Done Him Wrong', with her best all-around supporting cast, screenplay and music (""I Wonder Where My Easy Rider's Gone"")
It's also her only film to be nominated for an Academy Award. ****
The only bonus feature in this box is the 1933 Walter Lantz cartoon 'She Done Him Right'
Pooch the Pup is enamored with Poodles - a canine version of Mae West - who sings ""Minnie the Moocher's Wedding Day"" (by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), a song with obvious drug references.

7578747,5,B019OI2HJ0,A great deal on these timeless classics!,1487635200,,40,4.857142857142857
7578748,5,B019OI2HJ0,"""Mae West -  The Essential Collection""  is a long overdue DVD set featuring the films of the famous wise-cracking, buxom star of the 1930's- Mae West.

The set includes all of West's classic features from 1932-1940, omitting her lesser known ""The Heat's On"" (1942) and her 2 latter cult films ""Myra Breckenridge"" (1970) and ""Sextette"" (1978). The movies range from the mediocre to great but let it be known that even her lesser vehicles have their moments of hilarity.

""Night After Night"" ** 1/2 (1932) , in my opinion is the worst film of the bunch, with West, a supporting player, being the main highlight. ""I'm No Angel"" **** (1933) and ""She Done Him Wrong"" ***** (1933) are two of her funniest and wittiest; ""Belle of the Nineties"" **** (1934) and ""Goin' to Town"" **** (1935), two of her most enjoyable and personal favorites of mine; ""Klondike Annie"" **** 1/2 (1936), her most controversial that suffered greatly due to the production code of the time and despite some major edits, remains one of her stronger films. ""Go West, Young Man"" ** 1/2 (1936) and ""Every Day's a Holiday"" *** (1937), are somewhat lacklustre and mediocre West - mostly due to the production code, but both films have their charm. Her final major feature, ""My Little Chickadee"" *** 1/2 (1940), pairs her with the legendary W.C Fields. It has been stated the 2 stars could not stand each other, if this is true, you cannot tell in the final picture.

The films are contained within 3 DVD's. The picture quality and sound on all films is simply okay and are no better than the many VHS/DVD versions I previously owned. There are no extras other than the animated short ""She Done Him Right"" on disc 1. There are no chapter selection or language options; no star bios or photo galleries, and no linear notes. Basically you just get the films. This may come as a disappointment to those, like me, who think West deserves better but for the price, it is absolutely worth it. Several of these classic films stand up to repeated viewings.

Untamed, always fun, funny and bawdy, the legendary, full-figured West is fun to watch and is pure, unabashed entertainment. She was all about having fun and these comedies showcase her wit and art of joyful seduction. Highly recommended.",1484092800,,2249,4.739130434782608

7578757,5,B019OI2HJ0,"The terms ""legendary"" and ""one of a kind"" can unreservedly be used to describe the one woman who was known for being anything but reserved - the marvelous Mae West. She was the original sex symbol whose witty one-liners and  suggestive innuendo haven't aged a bit in nearly a century. West's glamorous looks and hour glass figure graced cinema screens during the 1930s and '40s, and her films were among the highest grossing in the darkest days of the Depression. In fact, it was partly because of West's bawdy, seductive persona that Hollywood was forced to adopt a strict Production Code in 1934. Although this resulted in some of the West sizzle being simmered down, her later pictures still made draws at the box office. Having always penned  her own sceenplays, she found ways to work around the restrictions of censorship. During the height of her popularity, Mae West was ahead of her time as a dominant woman working in what was then a male dominated industry.

The timeless allure and comedic talent of Mae West can be enjoyed with this definitive DVD collection from Universal Home Video. Nine films, from her very first screen appearance in NIGHT AFTER NIGHT (1932), to her priceless teaming with W.C. Fields in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE (1940) are chronologically arranged on three discs. What makes this set especially desirable is the inclusion of the rarely seen EVERY DAY'S A HOLIDAY (1937), which wasn't offered on any previous West compilation. All the films display decent image/audio quality, with only minor age/source related issues such as light lines and hiss. There are no supplemental features.

If you want to experience one of the most original, influential artists in the history of the entertainment medium, you need to pick up, or rather, ""come up and see"" this delightful collection.

My highest recommendation.",1469923200,6,1837,5.00983606557377
