325629,5,6301124537,"PHOENIX: THE WARRIOR (aka: SHE-WOLVES OF THE WASTELAND- 1988) is set in the future, after a plague has killed off the entire male population. Now, only women survive, roaming the earth in leftover costumes and vehicles from THE ROAD WARRIOR! Led by an old hag w/ tubes and wires in her head, and living in a room made of plastic wrap, known as Reverend Mother (Sheila Howard), these ferocious female bounty hunters need a male. Enter Phoenix (Kathleen Kinmont), who takes on the bounty hunters. Soon, she's on the run, as the bounty hunters don't take kindly to her killing them. Can she escape Cobalt (Persis Khambatta) and her crew of crazed, bounty hunting killers? Phoenix has inadvertently taken off w/ an impregnated woman. Pregnant w/ a MALE child! Naked waterfall sunbathing breaks out, as Phoenix and her new friend encounter a tribe of women in face paint. A baby is born! The eeevil Reverend Mother will stop at nothing the abscond w/ the infant. Uh oh! Cobalt has found them! Gunfire and poorly-realized karate ensue! Here too, we learn the meaning of the saying, ""Never bring a sword / knife to a gun fight!"". Can Phoenix keep the baby from the clutches of her pursuers? Years pass, and everyone looks exactly the same, except for Skyler, the ""baby"", who is now kindergarten age. Wha...? An adult man w/ premature baldness is discovered. Phoenix may need him, because Cobalt has arrived! More gunfire! More neo-cavewomen! More awesome hairdos! Just who does these women's hair, out in this post-apocalyptic desert, remains a well-guarded mystery. Real humor occurs when Phoenix must fight in ""the pit"". Infra-schlock like this is rarely witnessed by mere mortals! The thudding, synth-o-matic musical score, somehow manages to make it even less awe-inspiring. Listen to the grunts when anyone takes a bullet to the gut! Oh, the humanity! My favorite scene is when our heroes enter a burial ground, where skeletons in recliners are positioned in front of old Zenith TVs! Hilarious! Oh, and yes, there are indeed women sporting Mohawks! Movies like this are always hard to rate, since either a one or five star rating would make perfect sense, due to the preposterous-ness of it all! Ah, I'm in a good mood, five it is...",1511049600,29,2231,4.889182058047494
325630,3,6301124537,"This movie is unique in the way they shifted things around.  Since all the men were killed off by some plague the women are alone to continue the wars and battles.  This movie is base in the future but nothing is left from our society except for bullets, guns, cars and gasoline.  One woman is artificially implanted with a baby boy and gives birth to it.  Our hero Phoenix accepts the role of protecting this woman and her child from the evil women who want the child's DNA.  Just like most action adventure films their not much of a story line here but in this day of age is enlightening to see women on the other end of the gun.",1092960000,11,631,4.225

325651,3,6301124537,"Yes, it is a low-budget grade B Movie but sometimes as is,in this case the lack of funds to purchase full costumes for most of the 38 beautiful women works to its advantage.  Combining beautiful women with guns and dune buggies along with rather humorous fight scenes somewhat makes for a good movie.  Oh yeah, that's a typical male assessment of a movie with scantily clad beautiful women but it is reality. Sure this movie never going to win any awards but it's still his good male entertainment.",1513900800,4,498,4.6477272727272725

325656,3,6301124537,"Just by the cover art, you know this is not going to be good. Event remotely.

However, if you like cheesy fantasy crossed with mad max, goofy story and incongruous scene transitions, with... boobs and guns. Then this is your flick!",1513468800,3,232,4.658536585365853
325657,1,6301124537,"This thing was showing a 3-star rating, so although from the title and blurb it looked dreadful, I thought I would take a chance on it.  Silly me; it was even worse than I had originally expected.

So, here's the plan:  Get a few beach bunnies, not one of whom has any acting experience--or ability--to come in from the surf for a few days and switch to leather bikini tops and gym shorts.  Think up some weird plot about how the nasty final war killed off all the human males and most of the females, leaving only those beach bunnies and one deranged sorceress.  Drag 'em out into the Mojave with a director who hasn't a clue, a vague script from someone who doesn't know beans about how to stage a firefight or even how to shoot an M-16, some guns borrowed from a real movie studio, and a couple of dune buggies.

Don't forget to hire a couple of silicone-inflated strippers so we can have one incongruous topless scene; otherwise we won't get an R rating.

Borrow some clear plastic sheeting from a painter and drape it over some scaffolding to create the one interior set and see if that makeup guy we met could do some weird prosthetic work on our sorceress; doesn't matter what as long as it's weird.

Shoot a couple of hours of tape using that VHS camera mom gave us for Christmas.  Rent a horse for an hour for the big ending scene.  Cut to down to 90 minutes.  Add some credits.  Ta da!  We have a movie!",1512950400,11,1413,4.306818181818182

7811006,5,6301124537,"I was torn between one star and 5 stars. I'm giving this 5 stars because it might just be the worst movie ever made and I feel everyone should watch it just to see the horrible acting. The plot is terrible, the concept is worse and the acting is non-existent. The woman in this must have done some time on a casting couch because they certainly didn't get selected for their acting talent. It also serves as a torture test. If you can get through this stinker, you can handle any amount of torture possible.",1519516800,,507,4.347368421052631
