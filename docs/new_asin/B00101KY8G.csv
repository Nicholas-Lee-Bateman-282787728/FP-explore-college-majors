8236540,4,B00101KY8G,"This is a wonderful, albeit short tour of the wonders of the Oporto Cathedral, its architectural style, its history and its treasures. The dvd traces the history of this glorious monument and its recent restoration. The Oporto Cathedral is a magnificent edifice filled with beautiful treasures from the Middle Ages to the present era. It is a focal point for this important Portuguese city, the cradle of the Portuguese idenitity. The dvd could be a bit longer so that some of the adjoining neignborhood could be examined. It is, nevertheless, a wonderful introduction to this beautiful Portuguese city.",1199145600,,603,5.163265306122449
