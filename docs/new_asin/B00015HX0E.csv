8006843,5,B00015HX0E,"My Katie who is 3 years of age, loves this DVD. It's done so simply, no flash or loud noises. When ever she needs some down time this is what I reach for her. The illustrations are done as Beatrix Potter herself would have intended, and the narrator does such a good job. The music is very pleasant, and compliments the pictures perfectly.",1164067200,6,339,4.396825396825397
8006844,5,B00015HX0E,"We were given this DVD as a gift, and on first glance I thought it was no good.  Many of the stories are told with a sort of film-strip of illustrations.  But on watching, my kids are ENTRANCED.  The readers are fantastic, they are reading the full (and literary, compared to most children's fare) text, there is charming background music, and some of the pieces are actually animated, but very gently.  While the stories are gentle compared to all the bad guys, action and mother-losing in other kids movies, they're actually quite subversive, silly and real for young kids.  It's their favorite and I'm DYING for Family Home Entertainment to produce a similar piece with Rudyard Kipling stories.",1106697600,11,697,4.872881355932203
