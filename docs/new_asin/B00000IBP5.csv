1220951,5,B00000IBP5,"This series is one of my favorites- 1) it has a very entangling story line, and 2) the characters and artwork are superb!  This most recent DVD unravels quite a bit of information about the Draconians and Atlantis- Even Allen's past too.  Of course at the end of the DVD, episode 14, it leaves with yet another cliffhanger, leading into the next episode which is another two month wait.  But the wait is worth it, and to buy this series is worth it.  Two thumbs way up.  I's recommend this to any mecha-fan or fantasy fan.",981763200,,522,4.395833333333333
1220952,5,B00000IBP5,"These 3 episodes build up to the upcoming climax of the series and introduce vital characters and plots.  In episode 12, the Duke of Freid returns.  Millerna finds out something shocking about Prince Chid however.  Meanwhile, the Zaibach armies prepare to invade.  In episode 13, the battle at Freid begins.  Duke Freid brings everyone to Fortuna Temple and reveals a hidden power that Zaibach desires.  In episode 14, Van is seriously injured after he makes a blood pact with Escaflowne. The only ones that can save him are the Ispanos who originally built it.  Meanwhile, Dilandau and the Dragonslayers prepare for one last attack against the Crusade.  Episode 12 is a little dull, but the next 2 episodes are 2 of the best in the series.  Just wait till the battle in episode 14, quite possibly the series' best.",974073600,2,815,4.805755395683454
1220953,5,B00000IBP5,"While those who know anything about Escaflowne knows that it is one of the best anime series ever come over to the US, many have differing opinions on the best scene in the series.  But I believe that episode has one of the  best scenes in the entire Escaflowne series, and memorable one in the whole  anime domain.  This is the scene where Escaflowne summons the facotry ship.  It is simply unforgettable.  If you read the other reviews Im sure you  read that this is one series to watch, but I wanna re-emphasize it.  Watch  it, its awesome.",950313600,2,543,4.459183673469388

7910122,5,B00000IBP5,"During the time in Freid, Milerna discovers the truth about Allen and her sister. Her heart is broken, and she doens't know what to do with her feelings. Van and the others are cleared of all charges, and the battle with Zaibach begins. Duke Freid loses his life in battle and his son is left to surrender. Van is seriously wounded in the fight, but help comes from an unlikely ally. It is discovered that Van has made a blood pact with Escaflowne. Any injuries suffered by the mecha will be inflicted on Van as well. This reality scares Hitomi and causes her to urge Van to stop fighting.

This is another great volume. the drama and action reaches new heights. At first, I was disappointed with this series. It seemed outdated and bland, a totally different experience from when I saw it in the 90's. After watching it up to this point, I've come to remember why we all raved about Escaflowne all those years ago. It deserves as much praise now. Even though the animation is eclipsed by the stuff we are seeing now, the story makes up for the outdated production. Definitely don't miss Escaflowne.",1358726400,,1099,4.55050505050505
7910123,5,B00000IBP5,"I just started watching Escaflowne because a friend really wanted me to see it and I watched all 26 episodes and enjoyed every last one.  it has it all, and they make you wonder about life and love too.  Its like real life, but animated, very, very good.  I would like to see more anime just because of Escaflowne.  I am hooked!",1141948800,,328,4.241935483870968
7910124,5,B00000IBP5,"Duke Freid has returned to Godashim to find that his country is the next target of Zaibach.  Faced with the inevitable, he asks Alan Shezar join with him.  These two and Escaflowne must face the Four Demon Armies of Zaibach - some 55,000 men and 10,000 Guymelefs (war robots) - an overwhelming force.  All of this to fulfill Folken's plans to gain control of the treasure of Freid - the power of Atlantis.
Hitomi is in crisis.  Because of her peering into the grim future, she is plagued by memories of her horrid visions and refuses to help Van.  The Prince without a country becomes determined to do for himself what Hitomi has taught him, with unexpected and nearly disastrous effects.
Who is the mysterious ruler of Zaibach, who complains that a dragon is keeping him from seeing the future in his Destiny Prognostication Engine.  Now we find that he is an old man, once come from earth, but his agenda - is it really the conquest of all Gaea?
This is the turning point in the series.  There can be no question at the end of this DVD that this is more than just another struggle between the forces of good and evil.  The care that is taken to fill out each character and make fabulous kingdoms come alive makes this a drama that is far more believable than its fantasy setting.
Each episode offers something new, a piece of history, a new character like Dryden the trader, the strange Ispano people who made Escaflowne.  This is one of those cases where anime shows its ability be the equal of film in drama and quality.",1052265600,3,1524,4.492753623188406
7910125,5,B00000IBP5,"This series is quite a amazing.  If you can sit down and watch through the entire series over a couple of days with someone else who enjoys it I promise you won't be disappointed.  This volume offers some answers, some new questions and some amazing fights.  If you liked the first 3 volumes or even some of them you won't be disappointed.
keep the faith,

7910126,5,B00000IBP5,"good good anime series. top notch directing, story, characters buy them all! but be sure to watch subtitled version.",1013644800,,116,5.157894736842105
7910127,5,B00000IBP5,"This is one of the best Anime I have ever witnessed.  Not only is the Anime in general great, but this is one of my favorite videos of the series.  Episode 14 is, in my opinion, the best episode of the entire series.  Not only is the battle spectacular, but the events that are caused by it are just mind-boggling.  I say, get this video right away! ^_^",996883200,2,353,4.147058823529412
7910128,5,B00000IBP5,"The amazing thing about Escaflowne is that just when you think it can't possible get any better it does. With each subsequent volume the story gets more involved, the characters become more flushed out, and the stakes higher than ever before.
We begin to realise more and more Hitomi's role against the Zaibach Empire, the origins of Escaflowne, and best of all the juicy details of Allen's past and how they effect the present and future of all those involved. I was stunned by the level of intensity displayed in this volume of episodes. Definately worth every penny.",988329600,5,569,4.816326530612245
7910129,5,B00000IBP5,"This anime becomes more enthralling and complicated the longer you watch.  In this volume there seems to be a slight transition in Hitomi's view of Gaea.  We see more of the culutres and magic of Van and Allen's world, and the stakes become higher as Hitomi becomes closer with her new friends.  I love the new character Dryden who's so three dimensional for a more ""minor"" type character who only shows up half-way through the series.  Plus, the Club Escaflowne sections on the DVD's are so funny even if they do have spoilers.  This series is excuted so perfectly that the only thing wrong with it is that we have to wait until April 3 for the next installment!  (Even the dubbing is pretty good all things considered, as long as you get the uncut version.  It seems stupid to cut up this masterpiece especially considering how carefully they portray everything.)  Just buy it if you haven't already.  Even my brother loves this series, and nice boy though he is he's still very much your stereotypical male.  I.e. the only other anime he really likes to watch is Dragon Ball Z ^_^.  Something for everybody here, and even parents shouldn't mind this one.",986083200,2,1157,4.650246305418719
7910130,5,B00000IBP5,"Since it's short-lived airing on Fox Kids (which I watch only for anime)I've been hooked on ""Escaflowne"". Thus far I've purchased half of the Escaflowne dvds. I can honestly say that not only does it have an amazing plot and characters you'll enjoy familiarizing yourself with, but this series offers a story that the majority of people cannot resist. Being a well-rounded person when it comes to anime and story lines in general, I find myself able to fully appreciate the variety of excellences intertwined within this series. For the person who can't resist a complicated and intense plot, this is a perfect anime. Romantics will find that there are numerous relationships in progress (even to the point where one can get frustrated with the characters). Of course, there are plenty of fighting scenes for people who have a taste for the complications of war, and also animations that further urge one to relate with a person in the story for those of us who like seeing all types of beautiful characters. And I can't forget the fantastic world of Gaea for those who adore fantasy/medieval ages.  If anyone is interested in enjoying this series, I highly suggest the purchase of an uncut dvd or video cassette, so as to prevent cheating yourself of the true essence of this wonderful anime.",982800000,6,1293,4.850678733031674
