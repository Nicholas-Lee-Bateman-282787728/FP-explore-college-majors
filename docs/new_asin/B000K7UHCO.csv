2684150,1,B000K7UHCO,Creepy and boring. There is a segment on one video of just shots of feet while there is slow sexy saxophone music playing in the background. This is like a video someone would create as a joke making fun of baby videos. Very little cohesion or sense here. Weird shots of people playing with their babies. One dad looking miserable like he got dragged there and another with greased up hair and a handlebar mustache who is just way too excited. Maybe he time traveled from 1920 and is happy to have running water. I don't know. Don't but unless you want your baby to grow up to have a handlebar mustache and a foot fetish.,1319760000,5,621,4.362068965517241
2684151,1,B000K7UHCO,"In an ocean of pseudo-educational videos this bunch falls short.  Really short.  Each of the three discs features two classic nursery rhymes.  Thats right two for each disc.

Sing the rhyme see some characters play out the rhyme and 4 1/2 minutes your out the door.  And on a scale of fun? . . . .  BOR-R-RING.....",1295136000,3,314,4.421052631578948
2684152,1,B000K7UHCO,"haven't used this because I discovered that tv and dvd viewing is harmful for babies under 2 years of age (can cause attention deficit disorder, obesity, behavioral problems, etc.) ... and in veiwing one of the dvds myself, I found it to be mostly unenjoyable.",1262822400,2,260,4.8
2684153,5,B000K7UHCO,My son just loves all the 3 DVDs...He keeps watching them over and over and over again and never gets bored :). I would definitely recommend this product as it helps babies/toddlers grasp the language and the English accent very quickly.,1249257600,,237,4.804878048780488
2684154,3,B000K7UHCO,baby babble is far superior in teaching and holding interest. but this is a very good set of dvds,1238457600,,97,4.157894736842105
2684155,1,B000K7UHCO,"I don't usually write reviews, but I feel it's my duty to save anyone from buying these. Anyways, if you still want to purchase after this, you can buy mine for half price. Just contact screenname: ""acousticide"" at ebay. anyways, I have all the baby einstein vidoes, and it's true, they are not great but they do have some educational value and entertainment value. i bought these based on reviews and i was wildly disappointed by them. they have no entertainment value. I would recommend the fisher price series. anyways, i will take you through as typical scene on these videos.

a nursery rhyme is read while the screen focuses on ONE cartoon picture representing the whole rhyme. the camera just zooms in on different parts of the picture while it's read. the whole process is then repeated and it takes a while. now it cuts to some kids who have something in their hand, and it rhymes about 4 words over and over and over and then abruptly shows one of the characters who has something that doesn't rhyme. then there will be a lady singing the rhyme, but it's a dubbed over performance so it's cheesy. then it will just show kids saying wow!, wow!, wow!, then on to some babies laughing.... but not real laughing.. overdubbed fake laughing. so for 10 minutes, it will go over one nursery rhyme. i don't even see how this would teach any child to read. it is so lame.

on top of that the characters in between scenes are one dimensional paper mache (sp?) and it's just lots of noise and clapping and hard to understand. at least on the baby einstein, and fisher price they are puppet like and cute.

my 22mo son will not even pay attention for one segment. if you want to spend $30 to teach your child 20 irrelevant words, then by all means, buy this...........but buy mine before I use them for target practice.",1234224000,26,1816,4.513677811550152
2684156,5,B000K7UHCO,"I am a first grade teacher and my 14 month old daughter loves to read (thank goodness!) I checked these DVD's out at the library and she loved them!  I don't let her watch much tv except for an occassional Seasame Street for 5 minutes.  I love that the programs have music, signs, words to go with the pictures, etc and I believe are very educational.  I had tried the Baby Einstein and neither of us were too excited by them.  These DVD's get my daugher dancing, signing and laughing along and you can tell she is learning from them.  I also like that there isn't too much going on at once so that she can follow along.  A must have, especially to encourage early reading skills.",1230681600,9,680,4.31496062992126
2684157,5,B000K7UHCO,My two-year-old absolutely loves these movies.  They have lots of music to keep his attention and lovable characters.  The three-pack is a great value and I highly recommend them to anyone who's kids love movies.,1214092800,,212,5.0285714285714285
2684158,5,B000K7UHCO,"Our daughter LOVES this DVD series; admitedly, it was an ""oops"" order from our children's book club, but when I popped the discs in when she was about 5 months old, she went crazy.  She loves the characters and the graphics, and loves the music.  She is now 11 months old, and she will grab the DVD cases and point at the TV, indicating that she wants to watch one.  We also have the book set and the CD, and I don't believe that the books are worth it--few words and not very engrossing, but the CD has the same songs as the DVDs and we listen to it in the car.  And I will admit the tunes are pretty catchy, so it doesn't get on my nerves, either.",1199059200,,649,4.007751937984496
2684159,4,B000K7UHCO,"We checked the Hooked On Baby: Read and Rhyme DVDs out at our local library first.  We had never heard of them before then.  Our 22 month old just ""loved"" them.  She watched them over and over.  So, we decided to buy them to have them at home all the time.  We like that they are quick paced and are not just a cartoon.  We would recommend this product to other parents.",1184544000,,370,4.069444444444445
8154933,5,B000K7UHCO,Both my kids love these dvds. My eight month old starts to smile as soon as I press 'play'. She loves the animations and the songs. Would recommend to other persons.,1498176000,,165,4.354838709677419

8154938,5,B000K7UHCO,I have a beautiful 2 month old granddaughter and I wanted to find some books to start reading to her. But I came across Hook On Phonics For Babies. I sit her in her bouncer in front of the tv and she loves it. She never takes her eyes off the tv.,1378598400,,246,3.75

8154940,1,B000K7UHCO,These movies are way too short they should have put it all on one disk. The majority of each movie is for the parents. It would be better if one movie was for the kids and one movie for parents. Its a bit boring by the time my child gets interested in it its over.,1354147200,,264,3.8181818181818183
