4338328,5,B004EPYZRG,"As a fan of the books, I was not expecting very much.  You know how it is.  Someone in Hollywood reads maybe a chapter and half and then goes to town and puts a ton of their own ideas in, changes names and does a real hack job on the book we all know and loved.  This DID NOT happen here at all.  The movie exceeded my expectations in every possible way.

The basic plot is that Stephanie Plum of Trenton New Jersey has recently (okay---six months ago) lost her job, has a bunch of bills and rent to pay and needs some fast cash.  She blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job at his bail bonds business as a recovery agent (okay---bounty hunter).  He'd prefer to just assign her the easier stuff (naked flasher ftas) but she wants to go after the big money, trenton cop, Joe Morelli, with whom Stephanie has shared some intimate moments (okay---one intimate moment)in the past.

I'm not going to spoil too much with this review, I'm just going to address the things that I would have wanted to know before going to see this film.

First, I was not very happy when Katherine Heigl was cast as Stephanie.  I like her, but I don't think she is much of an actress.  She was a great Izzie Stevens, but since then she has mostly played Izzie Stevens.  But, surprisingly, she was goooood in this!  She played Stephanie perfectly, and I will probably have more respect for her as an actress in the future.  Stephanie herself grows up a little through the film.  She becomes more assertive and she tries so hard and she remains cheerful no matter what sort of bad things happen to her.  I don't think we could have recieved a better cinematic treatment of our favorite bounty hunter.

The other characters are great as well.  I felt Grandma Mazur was a little too lady-like, I wish she'd been in her track suit, and had seemed a little more Grandma Mazurish, but I hope there will be a sequel or six and we will get to see her develop more.  Morelli and Ranger are exactly what I hoped for.  Vinnie and Connie and Lula were pretty good as well.  You'll see Connie and recognize her instantly---she's entirely faithful to Janet's depiction.  And yes, the man who plays Vinnie does sort of look like a weasel.

The only tiny gripe I have was that Ramierz seemed a little too sane in the movie.  I understand that having that subplot in there would have probably extended the movie by at least twenty minutes, but I was so looking forward to him whispering about himself in 3rd person...and he seemed smarter in the movie, being more involved in the Jimmy Alpha operation.  And of course, I wanted more Lula, but the writers were very faithful to the book and Lula was not in the first book very much.  You can't have your cake and eat it too, I guess.

The last thing I have to say is that the people who wrote the script obviously spent a lot of time reading the books and there were plently of details in there that a fan will recognize and appreciate.  As Stephanie scrolls through her phone, we see the number for Pino's Pizza, Rex is in her kitchen always running on his wheel, Lula says she'll talk more if Stephanie brings her a snack, Lula tells Jackie it's hot and she's hungry (always), Ranger and Morelli refer to Stephanie as ""Babe"" and ""Cupcake,"" respectively, and there are a lot of other little details that I can't remember just now, but which helped the movie to have the feel of the books.  I love it so much when a movie is adapted this well.  I cannot wait to see this again, and I really hope there are is a sequel which remains as true to the series as this one.  I cannot say enough good things about this movie!  Go and see it soon, it will not dissapoint you.",1327622400,266,3683,4.3469985358711565

4  out of 5 bags of popcorn.

Having read all eighteen of the Stephanie Plum books, a few of them more than once, it is safe to say that I am a big fan of the series, even though SP16 was a little disappointing and SP17 was a huge letdown. In any case, I went to the multiplex with a clear vision in my mind of how the characters should look, act and interact. This is the first movie that I've actually gone to a theater to see in at least two years. Sadly, the director seems to belong to what I call the `mumble school of filmmaking', and the dialogue was very hard to follow at times. And no, that's not just my aged ears reacting because the forty-three-year-old I saw it with had a hard time hearing it as well. Best of all, we are in Orlando at the moment, with some dead time on our hands, and went to an early bird special for $5 per head. These days that's a bargain.

The movie worked. The chemistry between Plum and Morelli was obvious on screen. Morelli had a nice lithe but tightly muscular body with a well-proportioned butt. Too bad about those disgusting tattoos, but that too, was probably in character. Lula the street `ho' was perfectly cast, as were Stephanie's cousin Vinnie and the girl in the bail bond office who Janet Evanovich describes as carrying most of her weight in her chest. Stephanie's parents were well done, and Debbie Reynolds was a pleasant surprise as Grandma Mazur. I'd always pictured Grandma as sort of wizened and shriveled (sort of like the Nanny's grandmother), and Reynolds at a couple of months shy of eighty didn't quite fit my preconceived image. That being said Reynolds has a flair for comedy, and it worked. The only disappointment was the casting of Ranger, hence the one-half bag deduction. Ranger was believable, but a little too personable, and maybe even a tad too verbose. Ranger in the books didn't talk a lot, and could put a whole sentence into one word when he looked at Stephanie and said, ""Babe.""

The characters sounded like New Jersey residents and the row houses they lived in looked authentic.

Oh, and the 1953 Buick that Stephanie frequently borrows from the family is now a huge Buick from the 70s or 80s, but that worked quite nicely.

My partner and I are both looking forward to the next Stephanie Plum movie, assuming this one does well enough at the box office to justify the production.",1327622400,10,2383,4.476958525345622
4338399,4,B004EPYZRG,"One for the Money is one of my favorite books of all time.  This movie does an OK job of following the book (well as much as any movie follows the book) but the casting is off.  Morelli, Vinnie, and Grandma are way off.  Katherine Heigl isn't my favorite actress but she does a good job in the role.  I'd say 3.5 stars.",1519430400,,319,4.015873015873016

4338402,3,B004EPYZRG,"I am a fan of the first 10 Stephanie Plum books (those after that are just repeats of the same formula with no development or growth to the characters at all, which is a real shame.)  However, with this movie they did not do a great job at all with casting Stephanie or especially with casting Carlos.  They DID do a great job with casting Joe (and he is hot!).  But the miss on casting Stephanie and Carlos was they chemistry that between the 3 of these major characters was just never there.  They tried with Stephanie and Joe but Carlos as the dangerous yet sexy mercenary that was supposed to become the 3rd in the triangle just wasn't there.  The story was a bit rushed and didn't really stick close enough to the book to lend itself well to possible more movies which I believe is why it ended up flopping and not sequels, since it really needed to appeal to the series fan base in order for more people to get caught in the hype of what originally was a good storyline.  It is an ok movie still to watch, especially if you can get it for a bargain price.",1518825600,2,1061,4.227722772277228

She is a remarkable actress. OK so back to the book. Janet Evanovich has 20+ books on Stephanie Plum and I would pay top dollar to see Katherine Heigl play in them!

Katherine Heigle is so amazingly talented that its hard to understand why she would do a movie like this.  The plot is so unbelievable that her good acting isn't enough to overcome it and turn this into a good movie.  Her former romantic interest who is a cop but a criminal but also innocent who is indifferent at first but then becomes her partner is just way too predictable and pithy.

I love Debbie Reynolds ... but that was a terrible fit for the grandmother and I didn't really care for Jason O'Mara for Morelli (but he's hot and you get over it pretty fast), for the rest of the cast, I feel as if they did pretty good!

Katherine Heigl is an okay pick for Stephanie Plum, Sherri Shepherd makes a good Lula and Daniel Sunjata makes a great Ranger, but I'm not sure about the rest. Grandma Mazur should have been a little older. Joe Morelli is described as a heartthrob. I like Jason O'Mara but not for that role.

For me it was money will spent.  Just like books,  I'll watch it many times over the years. Also, Katherine Heigl is very good as Stephanie Plum.  Some reviews state that there wasn't chemistry between Katherine and Jason, but if you read the books,  it's very close to how it plays out.",1473465600,,634,4.1570247933884295

I was hesitant to watch the movie because I didn't care for some of the crude and violent material in the book in regards to the Ramirez character, but thankfully, the movie script left that stuff out. The actors they picked to play the characters were spot on, even though Ms. Heigl may have had a bit of trouble with making the accent and mannerisms believable, other than that, the movie was great fun and I hope to see a sequel.",1472860800,,488,4.258064516129032

4338996,3,B004EPYZRG,"It took a little over an hour for Katherine H's acting to finally get to a watchable level.  First time I've ever seen her act and it wasn't a good impression.  I love the books and the movie had such potential that just wasn't reached.  I love Jason O'Mara's in other parts.  He was an okay Morelli but needed to wear contacts as Morelli is described to have dark features -- not O'Mara baby blues.  Debbie Reynolds was very miscast.  Daniel Sunjuata made the best impression and even his character was portrayed against what was established in the books.  Such items include:

1)  Eddie Gazarra doesn't want to to catch Morelli more than Steph.
2)  As I mentioned above, Morelli is Italian dark.
3)  Ranger always sits with his back to the wall!  Always!
4)  Steph doesn't like guns.  She only uses it in desperation (that last act got it right) on Alpha but she never, never would have been happy about shooting the gun the first time or gone back alone for practice again.
5)  For goodness sake, have a bigger cookie jar for the scene.  Everyone knows Steph's gun fits in the cookie jar.
6)  The book(s) are great at balancing the drama and the comedy.  The movie fell flat with the jokes and transitions from one to the other.
7)  The book(s) are consistent on what Steph reacts to when -- rolling eyes, nausea and whatnot.  All the eye rolling and sick reactions were arbitrary in the movie.

I'm being generous giving it a three.  2 1/5 stars.  So much lost potential...",1468368000,2,1477,4.490566037735849

4339573,4,B004EPYZRG,"How hard it must be to make a movie of the first of a series of books after the characters have become real in the readers' minds. I was certainly curious to see who would be cast to play all the main characters in the book and surprisingly I think they did a really good job!  Morelli, Ranger, Vince and Lula were really quite good choices. Everyone was believable in their roles except for Grandma Mazur and Stephanie's parents. Grandma Mazur should have been someone more like Estelle Getty - the one who portrayed her in this movie was far too mellow and sweet and normal. The mother was lackluster and too fat and the father too alert. This movie is more like the pilot for a TV show, and I could see the characters becoming even more developed with time, and maybe they would have replaced Stephanie's parents after the first couple episodes like they did Jerry Seinfeld's father in his show. It would have been nice to be able to see Lula come into her own, and all her outfits. I think it may have been better to make this a made for TV movie in the first place, as a series of movies. This movie did not do great in the theater but perhaps it could be treated as a pilot and the rest of the books could be made for TV. Janet Evanovich is a wonderful writer and I think she should be fairly happy with this movie, as it stuck very close to the plot and characters that she created.",1447545600,2,1389,4.241509433962264

4339726,5,B004EPYZRG,"So this would be my fifth or so time watching this movie. See this movie is really good. So off the bat I will say that it gets a rating of five butterflies but it also has its flaws. Most of the cast that was casted for their roles I never suspected. The person for Lula is awesome and the same for Grandma Mazur. But Morelli, Ranger, and Stephanie were not how I pictured in my head. Dont get me wrong I love Katherine Heigl as an actress I just didn't think that she worked well as Stephanie. But then again she is the only one that willingly went into a dumpster I heard so that is good enough for me.

I thought that this movie did really well especially for the first book in the Plum series but of course they didn't advertise it well enough. Like how some of the other movies are in your face, this one wasn't given the advertising like that at all which kind of made me mad. I mean this movie was good and it should have sequels. To me the only person that tried to put it out there was Janet Evanovich.

Oh well. This whole movie from beginning to end made me laugh and it was just really good. They did change some parts in the book for the movie but that is okay for me. I am glad though that they kept in the part where Grandma M shot the turkey that was really good. Everything about this movie is soo good and I don't want to spoil any of it. If you haven't seen it yet you should so totally go buy One for the Money and watch it.

Stephanie is a totally inept bounty hunter, but eventually gets her man/men -- I thought Heigl played her well. Debbie Reynolds as the slightly wacky Grandma Mazur was entertaining. Lula, the prostitute with the big heart and too small wardrobe is completely right.  Morelli and Ranger--what more can I say?? it is no wonder Stephanie has a difficult time deciding between these two!  Thoroughly entertaining with some violence, lots of humor and well played characters.

4339803,3,B004EPYZRG,"One for the Money, 2011 film

Stephanie Plum was born and raised in the Burg, a blue-collar section of Trenton NJ (the state capital). She visits her parents and tells them her bad news - out of work for six months. [Unemployment has run out.] Theres not a lot of jobs out there. Her car is repossessed. Back home her Grandma has a gift. Her cousin Vinny wants help. Can she do skip tracing? She follows a lead. Can she bring him in? No. She goes to a gun shop to test pistols. No permit? No problem. Does her Mom know? She gets another assignment and goes to another part of town. Things aren't going well when gunfire erupts. Morelli meets her and explains things. Back at her Moms place she meets Bernie, who has information on Ziggy. She gets a telephone call from Ramirez, a threat. She has a new SUV. Then a new assignment: she brings him in, as is. A removed fuse immobilizes a car.

She stakes out Morellis car. Later she has a surprise visitor! She phones for help. [She needs a deadbolt lock.] Stephanie visits Carmens empty apartment. She finds a witness to the shooting. Then there is a new subject to arrest. [Stephanie is learning her trade.] Then she learns the man who talked to her fell from the fourth floor. Does she have enemies she cant see? A car drops off Lula, who talked to Stephanie. She needs the hospital. Stephanie tells this to her policeman friend, the practices on the firing range. Back home she meets Morelli, they discuss the events. Can they cooperate? Yes. Steffie will wear a wire. Morty Byers stops by to talk to her. [Dont leave keys or other items in plain sight!] Then there is a loud noise outside! Who was the target?  There is a fire at Rosa Gomezs apartment. Theyre safe. A Molotov cocktail started the blaze.

Stephanie visits Bernies to buy a shower curtain, and sees a flat nose guy across the street. That truck leaves for Route 78 and uses Exit 4. Illegal dumping? Stephanie walks to that dock. What is that powder? They hear shots! Two men won't talk now. They find out whats in that drum! Then Ramirez shows up to converse with Morelli. Can Stephanie join in? There is a surprise! Who do you think shows up? [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.] There is an ironic ending. Stephanie calls it in. The talk with Jimmy was recorded, Morelli is in the clear. Stephanie collects her pay. Will she meet a friend?

The credits list Pittsburgh, Ambridge, Braddock, and Kittaning Pennsylvania where this was filmed; also Trenton NJ and other places. The bridge connecting Trenton and Pennsylvania has a sign Trenton Makes, the World Takes, a reference to its industrial past. Overall this seems like a pilot for a TV series in its range of characters. Does it have too much shooting for todays corporate TV? Is that why it was filmed in Pennsylvania (where the Second Amendment is honored)? I think it has too much comedy for a murder mystery, and is too violent for a comedy. To best appreciate this movie you must have first read the novel to understand what was omitted from this movie. [Joe Morelli was the name of a gang leader that did robberies; Niccolo Sacco had the misfortune to resemble him and was executed for a crime he didn't commit.]",1437264000,,3218,4.475298126064736

and in some they matched my ideals completely ( Lula and the grandmother, even though I had her pictured older, I really like them casting Debbie Reynolds)
If the hair was different, I would have no complaints about Morelli, but have to agree he misses the Italian type completely.  HOWEVER he matches Morelli's personality type SPOT ON!!
Ranger wasn't mysterious at all, no strength, no scariness, just pretty; so the battle between who to choose is not even there.
Oh well I loved it and hope they continue to dramatize the series even if they only do a few ( or make it a TV series!!!)  anyway, really enjoyed it even after reading so many negative reviews.  I SAY  WATCH IT AND LOVE IT",1426896000,,952,4.570588235294117

4340663,4,B004EPYZRG,"This film is cute, but quite rough around the edges. If unfamiliar with the characters from the book series, most of these people make no sense.  Personally, I think Katherine Heigl is adorable as Stephanie, and she did a very good job given the disorganized script. Vinnie, Connie, and Lula were fantastic; I'd watch a TV series with these characters, and I hate TV. They are WKRP In Cincinnati-type caricatures that could easily be developed humorously through their quirks.

In my imagination, Grandma Mazur has always been a female ""Grandpa Munster"". Debbie Reynolds is too pretty and too ""Gidget"" to fit in well as a crazy Hungarian-American granny who stalks a funeral home for fun.  Reynolds attempt at what she must believe is a New Jersey accent made me feel embarrassed for the actress.  Neverless, Reynolds is so cute and lovable, if she were playing anyone other than Grandma Mazur I would have enjoyed her performance.  If another Plum book is made into a movie, casting should look for someone who looks like Frances Sterhagen and dresses like Cher.

The two men is Stephanie's life were so unlike the characters in the book I had to pretend I was watching a different story.  Ranger is a Manu Bennett in my imagination, and Joe is much closer to Raoul Bova...still the actors did a good job with what they had, and Mara's blue eyes were definitely piercing. He's just so IRISH.

Sunjata is really, really good-looking, indeed. However, he's much too warm and cuddly to work as Ranger in my mind.  He's so ""boy next door"" in this film, it's impossible to see that there's any sexual chemistry between him and Stephanie.  There's no dark air of mystery about him, so the character seems more like a ""nice guy"" who helps Stephanie for inconceivable reasons.

The dialogue and appearance of ""Mary Beth"" were pointless.

In the last several books, Lulu became so one-dimension she was more like a predictable, tired old stage prop than a character.  The movie brought back a dimension of her that I'd forgotten about...her warmth.  The actress portrays Lula as brave, kind, and resilient, and so much less like the cartoon the character has become.  There was definitely not enough of Lulu in this film!

I hope that movie movies will be made, because they're fun even if they contradict my imagination as a reader.  It's always good to watch something lighthearted where the good side wins.",1413849600,2,2401,4.817073170731708

A delightful movie.",1406764800,,364,5.0
4340872,3,B004EPYZRG,"I was a huge fan of the first few books in this series. Stephanie Plum is a sympathetic, hapless lingerie-buyer-turned-determined-bounty-hunter-by-default, and her antics are laugh aloud funny. Many of the book's scenes easily translate to a filmed version, and I was eager to see the first book brought to the big screen. I hadn't seen the film until now because I was told it was dreadful. Still, my affection for the stories finally overcame my reluctance, but I'm sad to say it was a rather large let-down nonetheless. 'One for the Money' is just not as funny or quite as human as the book.

The acting wasn't stellar.  While generally likeable, Katherine Heigl was only okay as Stephanie, Jason O'Mara was okay as Morelli (he's just not an Italian Stallion,) Sherri Shepherd was broadly comic as Lula, and the rest of the cast were journeyman craftsmanship level with two exceptions. Despite the fact I've always admired her, Debbie Reynolds completely overplayed Grandma Mazur, sucking the innocent wackiness out of the role. I blame the director and editor who let it happen; perhaps they were overawed by working with her. Each of Reynolds' scenes plays about two seconds too long, and it slows the film's pacing. The other stand-out performance was Daniel Sunjata as Ranger Manoso. I had never seen him before, and he was excellent in the role of a mercenary showing the amusing new girl some the ropes to bounty hunting. The screen chemistry between Sunjata and Heigl was very good, despite there being no flirtation between the characters at this juncture in the series.

Frankly, one of the reasons the books work as well as they do is because of the physical chemistry between Stephanie and Morelli, and Stephanie and Ranger, but for the first book, the Morelli/Stephanie chemistry has to sizzle. Heigl and O'Mara just don't have it onscreen, despite their obvious efforts. It's especially apparent in both the shower scene and the one where Morelli tapes the wire to Stephanie's bra and torso. They're more like awkward cousins than a man and woman who don't particularly like each other but their hormones are urging them to give in. Not so with Heigl and Sunjata. That's beautifully underplayed, and you could see potential for something to develop in the future.

The film captured many of the iconic Stephanie Plum moments, including Rex the hamster, and Stephanie's bad luck with vehicles. I think, however, the voice-over narration was a mistake. Heigl's accent is spotty, and the narration completely ruins any building excitement in terms of pacing as the film ramps up to the climactic third act. It's more of a dud firework than a rocketing extravaganza.

I may not have expected more, but I had so hoped to be wrong.",1406764800,,2741,4.924242424242424

Most true story can turn out either way, but this one is hilariously funny thanks to the good storyline, great sense of humor and playfulness, and a beautiful, versatile actress: Katherine Heigl ( my favorite, ....

No major characters die.  No major characters get laid.

There is no nudity shown to the audience.

The Katherine Heigl character is handcuffed-in-the-nude while she's taking a shower by the Jason O'Mara character.  She's later un-handcuffed by another man.  However, the audience doesn't get to see much of Heigl's body during those scenes.

The cast of characters were good except for Ranger.  I don't think the fellow cast had enough gravitas.  The rest were a great match for the book - even Debbie Reynolds - never would have envisioned her.  They changed the ending a bit - I think made it better.  They even used some of the book's dialogue.  I suspect they won't make more of these as not sure it did well at the box office.  However, it would have made a wonderful pilot for a TV series.

4341569,4,B004EPYZRG,"I luv Janet Evanovich novels & Stephanie Plum series-so happy to see one made into movie (hoping for more in future). As w/any book made into movie-it's not going to be able to cover all that's in the book or meet everyone's high expectations.  The dvd (has long previews intro) and wish the movies setting, KH's Stephanie Plum role were more Jersey like & luv Debbie Reynolds just the grandmother character looked too young & not as i guess you'd say feisty or spitfire as one in movie - other than that I really enjoyed the movie.  Joe Morelli, Ranger, Stephanie's parents, Connie, cousin Eddie (policeman), Stephanie's best friend & cousin  well casted-Vinny (i'm not sure-didn't have much of part-then again he wasn't around much).  Luv'd that they also included Stephanie Plum's hamster.  If I could give it 4.5 stars I w/b 4.  Was glad I got to watch the movie & will rewatch.

Side note to Janet Evanovich:  Thank you for taking suggestions.  I noticed in your last couple of books you stopped your overused phrases such as ""looked at you as though you were lunch"" and ""hooked his finger into my collar"", etc.  What a relief!",1400284800,,471,4.682926829268292

4341704,3,B004EPYZRG,"I like Heifl, but she is wrong in this, no real vibe from her towards Morelli or Ranger like in the books.  And neither of them are quite good looking enough.  Grandma Masur was flat and where were her sweatpants?  Lula was halfway decent, but not over the top like in the books either.
Really disappointed since I had hoped this would become at least several sequels, but not after seeing this one.  It wasn't all bad, but I wouldn't bother to watch it again.",1400198400,,460,4.376470588235295

4341706,5,B004EPYZRG,I really liked this movie. It was very funny and believe it or not I think there was a lot of chemistry between Katherine and the actor who played Morelli.

4341711,2,B004EPYZRG,Nothing like the book. The books was so funny that you laughed out loud. You can picture the grandma in your mind and Debbie Reynolds is not it she should have been more like the mother of Maude on the golden girls.,1399939200,,215,4.142857142857143

4341858,4,B004EPYZRG,"I loved the Evanovich novels and was wondering when they'd be brought to the big screen.

I was happy to see there was a movie I could watch instead of finishing the book  As with the book, it didn't grip me all that much, though it was a pleasant, light-weight film.  And nice to see Katherine Heigl again, after her departure from ""Grey's Anatomy.""  This film was OK, just nothing special",1399075200,,444,4.378048780487805

4341912,3,B004EPYZRG,"This movie had its moments, but overall I felt that it was about an average movie.  It seemed like it was trying so hard to be funny and entertaining that it fell a little flat in my opinion.  I also felt that the acting could have been better.  As someone who lived most of his life in New Jersey, I felt that the accents weren't done that well.  My wife may disagree with me on that one, but Im sticking to my guns.  To me it probably would have sounded better if Heigl just used a regular voice instead of lathering it on thick.  Overall One for the Money wasn't bad, but I also did not feel as if it was great either.

4341914,4,B004EPYZRG,Love the books so really wanted to like the movie. They did a good job toning down the violence. But some of the story line seemed left behind. I also had a hard time matching the actors to those that have been in my head for 17 books.,1398988800,,235,3.9166666666666665

4341918,2,B004EPYZRG,"A movie with with a couple TV actors. Honestly neither Katherine Heigl nor Jason O'Mara did that bad.  Their acting was a little heavy handed, but not that bad.  The problem is the screenplay and direction.  It took what might have been an interesting story about an interesting character and turned it into some kind of Scholastic style middle-school movie.  A long time ago I learned that if you're dating a girl who keeps saying, ""I'm actually pretty smart"" chances are the opposite is true.  This movie taught me that films needing a 4th wall breaking constant narrative monologue explaining what's going on are exactly the same kind of dumb.",1398816000,,646,4.836363636363636

4341993,4,B004EPYZRG,Watching this fun movie makes me want to read the original novel. Katherine Heigl has fun making this film and that shows up in her sprightly performance. We enjoyed the movie and rooted for her randy and unlikely law enforcement career. Well done and I look forward to more of this character's adventures.,1398729600,,306,4.7924528301886795
4341994,5,B004EPYZRG,Stephanie was portrayed very well by Katherine. That would be a difficult character. We all have a mental image of Stephanie and Ranger. I was not disappointed. And debbie as grand ma was simply great. Keep them coming!!!,1398643200,,221,4.842105263157895
4341995,3,B004EPYZRG,"I have read every book in this series and have come to expect a certain image for the characters.  I expect Morelli to be drop-dead, ruggedly handsome with an Italian edge and black, wavy hair; the actor cast for this part did not have this quality.  However he was probably the best-cast of the three.  The person playing Stephanie is woefully wrong for the part; not cute and perky enough and way too Miss America-appearing for the character.  The Ranger character was all wrong and not Latino enough.  I liked the Lula and Connie casting; the actors fit the characters very well.  So much for the casting.  The story followed along pretty well with the book with a few minor exceptions.  Although the miscasting annoyed me, the story held my attention.  I would not watch again but it was OK entertainment.",1398643200,,809,4.680851063829787
4341996,2,B004EPYZRG,"I have read most of the books by Janet Evanovich, and this book was the best of all.  Having said that, the movie was really poor.  Katherine Heigl is one of my favorite stars -- she should have rejected this part -- it was beneath her.",1398643200,,236,4.108695652173913
4341997,3,B004EPYZRG,Decent movie with some funny moments. Not bad at all.  I would recommend this as a date movie at home.,1398643200,,102,4.1
4341998,5,B004EPYZRG,I gave it a five because we are big fans of the book it was not as good as the book but it was cool to see the characters come to life on screen.,1398643200,,145,3.2941176470588234
4341999,4,B004EPYZRG,I had read the book so was looking forward to the movie. Some of the cast were not who I would have chosen for the roles but all in all it was good. Really liked Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazar.,1398643200,,195,3.9
4342000,5,B004EPYZRG,"I watched this for free on Amazon Prime.  I wasn't expecting much.  I thought it worked incredibly well as an action comedy with a little romance.  At first I thought Ranger looked a little too young but then he made it work.  And Morelli wasn't quite as ""pretty"" as I pictured him.  But within the first 15 minutes I believed.  This took me back to when the series was fresh and brand new and I fell in love with it all over again.  And hey my husband really liked the movie too!

Not sure what any fan of the series has to complain about.  I liked it so well I bought it so I could be sure to have it in my library.  I think this would be just as enjoyable on a future viewing.",1398556800,,679,3.962962962962963

4342043,3,B004EPYZRG,"I'm a fan of the books so I was looking forward to this movie but was disappointed to hear such mediocre reviews.  Now, having seen the movie I understand.

The screenplay wasn't an issue for me like so many book-to-screen movies.  The problem is casting and chemistry.  I found myself saying ""That's Connie?"", ""That's Vinnie?"", ""That's Morelli?"" and on down the line for nearly every character.

I don't think the cast studied their characters beyond the screenplay, or maybe book one.  Hegel may be the exception.  While not perfect, she came the closest to her character and that saved the movie.  With the number of books in double digits at the time of production, each main cast member should have been required to read all books in the series.  These characters are well developed and fans expect to see the chemistry on screen that they know in print.  Sadly, I just didn't believe they were who they were supposed to be.

Anyone who saw the movie without first reading the books is not likely to be inspired to read them.  The quirky fun from the page is lost on-screen and that is unfortunate!",1398556800,,1103,4.658031088082901

4342045,4,B004EPYZRG,My Wife and I enjoy the movie completely.  We are fans of the books and we both agreed this was a very good vision of what the books had in them.

4342048,4,B004EPYZRG,"I am a big fan of Janet Evanovich which includes the Stephanie Plum novels, so I figured I would like this movie and I did.  The characters didn't match up to the ones in my head, but hey, that would have made it creepy!  I would like to see all of the series made into movies but I would still read the books first.  I think the book made me laugh more, but maybe the first one didn't, I can't really remember.",1398470400,,411,3.9878048780487805
4342049,4,B004EPYZRG,"Too often, books made into movies, tend to butcher the original story.  This kept close to my version of the book.

I admit that the Ranger and Gramma Mazer in my head were different.  But I don't think that there is a real live version of 'my' Ranger.  However, Debbie Reynolds as Gramma Mazer was hysterical!!

I only wish that this had been a better moneymaker, so that the other books in the series could have been made into movies.",1398470400,,436,4.4

I had visualized in my mind what Ranger would look like.  But when I saw him in the movie, he was better than I had visualized.  And to finally see Joe Morelli in person was exciting.  Also the casting of her cousin Vinnie could not have been better.  And Lulu was better in person than she was in the book.

4342431,2,B004EPYZRG,"Having ready every one of the Evanovich series of which this is the start, and after talking with others who have read them, I can tell you that the consensus is that this does not live up to the book.  Katherine Heigle lacks the comedic timing for this role and leaves you wanting to know where the main character is.  They should have used Sandra Bullock for this part (again, consensus) even if they thought she was too old for the part.  Really?!  She can easily play a woman in her 30's.  The direction was way off too.  Maybe they'll redo this with a different crew.  LOVED THE BOOKS!",1397779200,,590,4.3577981651376145

4342435,4,B004EPYZRG,"I really enjoyed this movie, and yes, I'm a Stephanie Plum fan.  The casting is spot on--I'll watch anything Heigl does, and she's a fun Plum.  Morelli and Ranger are cast well.  A car explodes, Stephanie Plum gets into trouble consistently, and Stephanie's hamster Rex gets a role.  If you're looking for an action movie with a strong-but-klutzy female lead, this is the movie for you--it's worth the time to watch.",1397520000,,416,4.816901408450704

Surprisingly, my 11 year old son liked it.  Many people found this movie bad and I went with those reviews.  However, I didn't have any else to watch one night and decided to give it a go.

Yeah, it's not a world-class flick or super great cinema.  The book wasn't great literature.  But if you liked the book for what it was - fluffy, frilly brain candy - you'll like the movie.  That casting is brilliant.  Vinnie is EXACTLY like I pictured him, and Debbie Reynolds is adorable as Grandma Mazur (ok, a bit less crazy than in the later books... but it's Debbie Reynolds and she's been personal fav since I saw Singing in the Rain.)  Ranger and Morelli are every bit as sexy as they ought to be and Steph is a very lucky fish-out-of-water.  Only real problem I had was that Katherine Heigl's voice-over monologues sounded like she was reading a script and not like we were listening to Steph think.

I know there are a series of books from which the movie is based but I have not read them, so keep that in mind.  I can't tell you anything about how closely characters and plot matched the book.  (I may actually start reading the series now that I've seen the movie though)  Why do people describe the movie in reviews?  You can see the plot outline above. Still not sure?

Katherine Hegl does not fit my original idea of what this Jersey girl would look like, but she won me over. She always seems to hit the mark, in my experience. I had pictured Ranger as slimmer and Morelli as more robust, but again those were preconceptions that were overcome by the actors cast.

This 1st one in the Stephanie Plum series is a good movie and entertaining, however, if you'd read the books, you know that the many of the character's weren't cast well.  Lula, Vince and Dad are well cast.  Heigl does a good job.  The others may have acted well but were a disappointment when compared to the book.....The cop is definitely not 6 foot tall and well built, etc.  Getting past that, I'd watch it again.",1395705600,,464,4.348837209302325

The casting is good, with the exception of Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur.  She doesn't fit the mental image conjured up in the book, at all, but this doesn't effect the appeal of the film.

The movie is pretty close to the book just a couple changes but it worked.  Stephanie has blue eyes and Morelli has brown - visa versa in the movie!  But I loved the actors!  Not too sure about Debbie R as grandma Mazur but ok.  Bring on more!,1393459200,,357,4.176470588235294
4343529,2,B004EPYZRG,"Awesome book, terrible movie.
Lula- you were the only saving grace.
Go read the books by Evanovich instead, much better.",1393372800,,120,5.05
4343530,4,B004EPYZRG,I like the Janet Evanovich novels featuring Stephanie Plum. This movie kept the flavor of the book with great casting and great pace. Hope there are more on the way!,1393372800,,165,4.533333333333333
4343531,4,B004EPYZRG,This is a very entertaining movie and I believe that everybody would enjoy watching it. The movie was good enough that it just kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next.,1393372800,,182,4.382352941176471
4343532,2,B004EPYZRG,"A sloppy, half hearted attempt to translate one of Janet Evanovich's amazingly entertaining books into a movie.  At best I would call it a grade ""C"" made for television flop.  Most importantly, the actors chosen to portray the characters seemed as talented as college drama students, maybe not even that with the exception of Ms Debbie Reynolds, who is terrific in anything she does.  For Ranger you would imagine  someone like Fernando Lamas, but this actor is not anyone a woman would give a second look to and his personality is as dynamic as a wet noodle.  The same said for the actor portraying Joe Morelli - forget it !!!!  Shame on the studio for delivering a slap in the face to Evanovich's work.  DON'T EVEN BOTHER",1393372800,,723,4.645669291338582

Heigl was able to pull of Stephanie Plum, and Morelli and Ranger's characters were well cast. I'm a little disappointed with Lula (I always pictured Kym Whitley in this role but I have no beef with Sherri Shepherd), but all in all I can say I would definitely watch the next installment.",1392768000,,458,4.275862068965517
4343852,3,B004EPYZRG,The Stephanie Plum series is one of my favorite.  The movie was cute and I enjoyed it but I would have liked to see Debra Messing or Sandra Bullock as Stephanie Plum.  Katherine Hiegl just did not portray the character as I would like.,1392768000,,235,4.318181818181818

4343859,5,B004EPYZRG,This movie was cute. It was funny and it was a feel good movie that is clean. not full of bad language,1392681600,,102,3.6818181818181817
4343860,3,B004EPYZRG,"I didn't expect much from this movie since it was rated so poorly and since the books themselves are just bits of fun. This stays pretty true to the first book, if I remember it right, except for the scenes with Lula when she is attacked.

Katherine Heigl seems a great fit for Stephanie Plum. The young man who plays Ranger is a pretty good match to my imagination also, but not as closely. The man who plays Joe Morelli is not anything like I pictured. Still, it's fun to see what Directors do with movies. In all, it isn't as funny or outrageous as the books, but it is OK for a first movie of the series. If they can get funding for a second, maybe it will be better than the first due to experience. The writing and delivery in this one is fairly flat.",1392681600,,757,4.149659863945578
4343861,5,B004EPYZRG,"I found this a funny and entertaining movie.  Normanly I do not like Katherine Heigl movies, but this one was good.

4344059,1,B004EPYZRG,This movie did not make any sense at all.  The so-called plot was so chopped up it was hard to follow the story line.  I'm sure Janet Evanovich cringed when she saw the movie.,1392422400,,175,4.117647058823529

4344066,3,B004EPYZRG,"Thank goodness I had been warned before watching the movie that it wasn't even close to being as good as the book, so I wasn't extremely disappointed, and it had enough of the book in it to make it recognizable, but still, it was just O.K.  Although the cast were all well-known and talented actors, after reading the books I had already pictured the characters in my mind (think Sandra Bullock and Chloris Leechman) so that was hard to accept the actors in their roles.  That being said, it just gets an O.K. rating from me.",1392249600,,525,4.458333333333333
4344117,5,B004EPYZRG,Great movie.  Hoping they continue to make them for the rest of Janet Evanovich's books.  I was impressed that they followed the book and pretty much match the characters.  I must admit that I thought Morelli and Ranger would look different (after reading all of the books you get an impression of what the characters would look like.) but Lula pretty much matched what I would picture her.  Any Janet Evanovich fan should buy this.,1392249600,,432,4.72

4344120,3,B004EPYZRG,"Anyone who is a reader of Evanovich's books would be disappointed with the casting in this movie of her first book of the series.  Much as I like Debbie Reynolds, she was not a good choice for Grandma.  Ranger was totally miscast.  He should be more of a Clint Eastwood actor.  Morelli had no chemistry at all with Stephanie.  Lulu was all wrong.  The story is a good one or Evanovich would never be up to book 20 with the characters and storyline.  But whoever was the casting director on this got it all wrong.",1392163200,,512,4.326315789473684
4344121,5,B004EPYZRG,"I have read many books in this series. When I saw One for the Money, it was as if Stephanie Plum came to life. Katherine Heigi played her perfectly!

4344123,3,B004EPYZRG,I've been reading the novels for a while now and they talk alot about Stephanie's blue eyes and Morelli's carmel brown eyes so that threw me off right way. I thought Ranger was okay but details like a pony tail pulled back would have added to him. I didn't like Morelli's character at all. Face was too harsh and there was NO chemistry between him and Stephanie. I'll stick to the books.,1392076800,,387,4.388888888888889

4344125,3,B004EPYZRG,"Something was just off for me in this movie. I really couldn't put my finger on it. When I read this book it was on a plane, and I laughed out loud so much, people asked me what book I was reading. I love Katherine Heigl, but she just wasn't Ms. Plum. I guess I always saw Ms. Plum more like a J-Lo. Broads in Trenton  have Jersey accents. I thought the detective was spot on. I also thought Bondsman cousin Vinnie was older less skinny creepy. More lovable. Bigger character....bigger presence on the screen. My husband liked it, but he has not read the series.",1392076800,,562,4.30188679245283

4344225,4,B004EPYZRG,"I found the movie entertaining and funny - two things I look for in any movie or book. I started the book, but did not finish it - time I suppose - so maybe my expectations were not as high as those who read the book/series. I did read enough to recognize the story in this movie, but if it deviated from the book I didn't catch it from the little I read.

I felt the acting was good, and Stephanie Plum's character well portrayed. I would watch another if it is on par with this one.",1391904000,,484,3.9896907216494846

The movie and the character redeemed themselves at the end a little bit I would have liked to get to know Ranger a bit more as well as the hookers but the main characters  family could be written out and no one would miss them.

4344302,1,B004EPYZRG,A few places where we had to fast forward through some inappropriate scenes. Not necessary for the plot of movie!,1391558400,,113,4.7
4344303,4,B004EPYZRG,"I enjoyed the movie even though I don't like Katherine Heigl. They did a great job sticking to the storyline of the book for the most part which is why I gave it a 4. If I saw the movie without having read the book I'd have given it a 3 for ""not bad, but not stellar"". Read the book, it's more fun.",1391558400,,298,3.746031746031746
4344304,4,B004EPYZRG,Light hearted fun movie. Humorous.  Not really an 'action' movie but I didn't think it was going to be.  I liked the plot and it had a great ending.,1391558400,,148,4.068965517241379

4344346,3,B004EPYZRG,"I was disappointed in the movie.  I have read all of the Stephanie Plum novels and laughed out loud in most of them.  Katherine Heigl was pretty good in the part, although she dressed too nice for the part.  I was expecting more from the 2 male leads.  Debbie Reynolds was good as her grandma but not wrinkled enough or funny enough",1391558400,,332,4.306451612903226
4344347,3,B004EPYZRG,"Just a fun action comedy movie. Enjoyed this because it was not a dark, twisted, confusing plot. Sometimes I just want a little action, some comedy, and fun characters. A nice way to spend a Saturday night....",1391472000,,209,4.675675675675675

4344349,4,B004EPYZRG,"I wasn't sure about this movie, but I gave it a shot and I was pleasantly surprised by it. There's some good humor and a few twists and turns. It's not one of the best movies I've ever seen, but I was pleasantly surprised by it.",1391472000,,228,3.9782608695652173

4344351,1,B004EPYZRG,"Who needs Plum? Why would anyone dangerous or not spill their guts to her? Why does Ranger help her unconditionally? Why does Morrelli need her help? Why oh why did I wast my time watching this stupid movie?

SO many unbelievable and completely unrealistic characters and situations throughout the entire movie. A huge stinker.",1391299200,,327,5.055555555555555

4344353,1,B004EPYZRG,Watched for about 15 minutes and just couldn't watch anymore.  Maybe it was my mood at the time - I like Evanovich's books but it seemed too silly.,1391299200,,147,4.25

4344496,4,B004EPYZRG,"I really enjoyed this movie having read all 20+Stephanie Plum novels by Mrs Evonovich! The only thing that didn't feel right was Grandma Mazer's age. I felt she should have been closer to her 80's or 90's. But other than that, everything looked like I had imagined in my mind after reading the books!! Good job on this one!",1391299200,,323,4.491525423728813

4344499,4,B004EPYZRG,I like Katherine Heigl movies. This was entertaining and fun. A few funny lines as well. I would suggest it.,1391212800,,108,4.45
4344500,3,B004EPYZRG,"I was very excited about this movie... until I saw it. I think the casting of Joe Morelli was off - he looked Irish, not Italian to me.  Katherine Heigl did a good job as Stephanie, but the movie overall did not match the book. I wish they had done a movie covering several books, maybe 1-4 or 5, so her relationship(s) with Ranger and Morelli were more developed.",1391212800,,364,4.27536231884058

4344502,5,B004EPYZRG,I thought this movie was excellent! it was funny and kept you wanting more at the end! Heigl was perfect for the lead role also. Please purchase it and watch it!  Anne Knoxville Tenn,1391212800,,182,4.352941176470588
4344503,5,B004EPYZRG,It's a fun movie that you can just enjoy. It was well written and the actors did a great job.,1391126400,,93,3.7
4344504,4,B004EPYZRG,"This is adaptation of an Evanovich book-Stephanie Plum heroine. Light entertainment  mystery that I really enjoyed after trying to watch Flight(I never bail out on stuff, but that was way too heavy for me). Depends on your mood. Enjoy",1391126400,,234,5.0
4344614,3,B004EPYZRG,Similar to the Bounty Hunter with Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler.  My husband and I enjoy watching it and would probably watch again.,1391040000,,137,4.956521739130435

4344617,5,B004EPYZRG,I know it didn't get great reviews when it was first released but I really enjoyed it. I've read all the books in this series and wish some of the others would be made into movies too. At first I didn't think I would like the casting given I was so familiar with the characters but I ended up like the actors in their roles too.,1390953600,,328,3.984848484848485
4344618,3,B004EPYZRG,"Like the title says - not bad, not great.  The story is a little weak, and predictable.  If I see this on TV in the future, and there is nothing better on, I'll watch it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",1390953600,,213,3.608695652173913
4344619,4,B004EPYZRG,"Love affair gone bad & a chance at revenge...not much better than that. Predictably Stephanie is goo-goo eyed when she sees the guy again but in the end, she really shows just how tough she is. I was really surprised (and pleased)at how she transformed into the person she did from the beginning to the end...good flick!
I hate to give too much info in my reviews, I would rather spark an interest and recommend that you watch or don't...this is a def watch!",1390953600,,458,4.464285714285714

4344621,4,B004EPYZRG,"The movie was enjoyable and while at first you think Kathering Heigl is no Stephanie Plum, she grows on you as do the other characters. A good movie and mostly true to the book. I'd watch again on a rainy day.",1390953600,,209,4.121951219512195

4344675,3,B004EPYZRG,It was a little better than an ok movie.. Katherine Heigl is really cute in it and plays her part pretty good. The story is unbelievable but it's definitely a comedy.,1390867200,,166,4.387096774193548
4344676,5,B004EPYZRG,Would recommend for anyone that just wants to sit and enjoy uncomplicated fun.  We need more movies like this in this crazy world.,1390867200,,130,4.6521739130434785

4344682,1,B004EPYZRG,Completely predictable and boring.  The main character is completely clueless which could be funny but in this case is absurd and foolish.  Sometimes bad movies are so bad that they can be entertaining but this movie is simply insipid.,1390521600,,235,5.0
4344683,4,B004EPYZRG,I watched the movie after reading the books. I enjoyed this movie. It was funny. I would like to see some of the other books made into movies.,1390521600,,142,4.107142857142857

4344785,4,B004EPYZRG,The movie followed book closely.  Have read and enjoyed several of Susan Evonivich's books.  I enjoy Stephanie Plum's role and the comedy in the book and the movie..,1390435200,,165,4.857142857142857

4344789,4,B004EPYZRG,"It was not what I expected - I'd pictured the characters a little differently in my head - but it was highly enjoyable.

4344793,3,B004EPYZRG,It was a good movie for a night when you have had a hard day at work and want to watch something that requires little or no thought.,1390348800,,132,3.75
4344956,2,B004EPYZRG,The movie had none of the spark or wit of the book; the books series is one of my favorites for laugh-out-loud situations and sharp dialogue.  This movie did not capture any of the characters and their unique personalities.,1390348800,,223,4.717948717948718
4344957,3,B004EPYZRG,I did not have expectations for this movie. The cast was good but it cannot compare to the books! I will stick to the books from now on.,1390348800,,136,3.892857142857143

4344959,3,B004EPYZRG,Katherine Heigl is 99% of the reason why I watched this movie. Otherwise I would have probably passed on this one.,1390348800,,114,4.476190476190476

4344963,2,B004EPYZRG,Has little depth.... but a nice escapist movie.  Follows the book well.  Katherine Heigl plays main character well as do the supporting actors.,1390262400,,143,5.173913043478261
4344964,4,B004EPYZRG,"She enjoyed it and so did I.
Some of the language was unnecessary.
Still, according to my bride, it was faithful to the book overall.
Curious, was there a sequel?",1390262400,,162,4.433333333333334
4344965,5,B004EPYZRG,Cute movie.  A little different from the book.  Initially disappointed in actors chosen for men in book but by middle of movie was happy with both.  Katherine Heigl is a good actress.  Follows the book with the exception of Lula,1390176000,,228,4.625

4345050,4,B004EPYZRG,Katherine Heigl played this part effectively. No twists or turns in plot. This is an easy movie to watch and performers hit their marks well. Not spectacular or thought provoking but just easy entertainment.,1390089600,,207,5.117647058823529

4345052,2,B004EPYZRG,"Lacked the humor and ""raw"" sense of New Jersey that Stephanie Plum series has in print. Too bad, it would seem that these books would be made for movies - they're not that complicated and deep - but they do rely on character development whilch was completely lacking in the movie. Very miscast.",1390003200,,294,4.566037735849057
4345053,4,B004EPYZRG,"I don't know why so many people say this movie is bad. I thought it was a great movie. I am not a fan of Heigl, never liked her on Grey's, but the movie was cute and a pretty good adaptation of the book. I am hoping for a sequel!",1389916800,,229,3.6
4345054,5,B004EPYZRG,"I've read most of the Stephanie Plum novels and really enjoyed them, particularly the early ones.  I really didn't expect much from this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The acting was great (at least for the most part).  I thought Katherine Heigl was spot on for Stephanie.  Of course, I knew it wouldn't be exactly like the book, but I thought it captured the spirit of the Stephanie Plum novels really well.  It was funny, entertaining, and well acted.  I'd love to see sequels!",1389916800,,488,4.682352941176471

4345251,4,B004EPYZRG,"I made the mistake of skimming some of the reviews; about half of them think it was poorly cast.  Well, since I haven't read the books yet (I'm going to fix that immediately), I thought they were perfectly cast.  Heigl's accent slipped slightly once or twice, but she was perfectly cast as Stephanie Plum.  Ranger?  He was believably sexy.  Morelli?  I wouldn't mind him calling me cupcake... ah, but I diverge.

The location shots are good and believable.  The pacing is only slow for about ten minutes the whole movie.  The cast of characters is absolutely hilarious.  I'm hoping, since there are multiple books out there, that Heigl sticks to her guns and makes a sequel.

My biggest pan was just the slip on Heigl's accent, but it was slight.  Bring me a sequel.  I'll see it in the theatre.",1389484800,,795,4.5928571428571425

4345320,2,B004EPYZRG,"As it often happens, a good read kills an okay movie. While reading the book, the utter ease with which it could be filmed just jumped out in each and every chapter. It was more of a fleshed-out script than a novel, even an action-detective-comedy novel, if there is such a category. Character development was not on the table, cuteness was.  Heigl was okay in the movie, the rest of the cast just didn't fulfill expectations, except for Debbie Reynolds, who was just delightful, but then she always was.

Full disclosure: I grew up in northern New Jersey in the early sixties.  We talked like the Sopranos, not like Sister Plum and her buddies.  This is probably an okay date movie for teen-angers from Iowa.",1389398400,,709,4.648

I thought the casting was good but thought Katherine Heigl was a bit over the top with her New Jersey accent.  While we all know Stepanie is a born and raised Trenton girl the majority of her loyal fans do not ""hear"" the accent when immersed in reading about her capers.

It's sad when the only decently acted part in the movie is a supporting character who's barely in the movie (the receptionist.)

With only the superficial details of the characters visible - and poorly casted - it left Stephanie looking plastic and that is the most flattering it gets.  It was like a very long blond joke with a sad punchline. For characters full of life, it is better left to one's own imagination than a poor casting director who has clearly not embraced the entire series in directing what could have been a great beginning.

That said, if you don't like to read, can't afford the time to listen to the unabridged audiobooks and don't mind superficial and surface characterizations, then the movie is for you!",1388016000,,685,4.779661016949152

4346270,4,B004EPYZRG,"For those of us who are fans of the series, this is a nice way to rekindle the memories.  I would recommend to all actually reading the book before watching, as the movie falls short of the laugh out loud humor found in Janet Evanovich's written work.  Also was slightly disappointed in Grandma Mazur's role in the movie compared to the pervasively funny portrayal in the book.  Lula however was everything I imagined her to be, leaving me yearning to see the rest of the books brought to life as she becomes so much more integral to the story lines as the series goes on.
Definitely a decent way to pass the time during the blustery winter days.",1387324800,,646,4.4576271186440675

4346273,3,B004EPYZRG,Disappointed as I'm a huge Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series and could not relate to any of the characters being portrayed by the stars.  Am fairly positive that my dislike for the movie is very subjective due to how I have envisioned the characters through all 20 books and had I not read all the books probably would have enjoyed it.,1387152000,,341,4.590163934426229

That may have been funny back in the '50s, but not today.",1386806400,,347,4.117647058823529

4346351,5,B004EPYZRG,"My wife and I watched this movie for the first time a couple nights ago. All in all, I thought it was a fun movie to watch. Katherine Heigl does a great job in the lead role, playing her part to perfection. At no point does the movie drag and there's plenty of action and twists and turns in the plot to keep it suspenseful until the end. A number of the negative reviews note that the cast in the movie is inconsistent with their perception of the characters in the book. So, if you've read the book be aware of this. However, let's not forget, when we read a novel we tend to imagine the characters as people we know or at least know of. This is going to be subjective, and it's unlikely that the actors in the movie are going to be like the characters as we imagine them. Such is inevitable and shouldn't detract from our enjoyment of the movie itself. Being fairly familiar with parts of South Jersey, I felt that the actors did a great job of portraying the types of personalities one finds in a place like Trenton. Watch this movie. It's a great way to spend a relaxing Friday evening.",1386547200,,1091,4.25

4346474,4,B004EPYZRG,"I was taking a break from reading Explosive 18 by Janet Evanovich and was scanning the movie selection.  I found One For the Money and took a longer break to view it.  Yes, it is not an Academy Award quality film but most Stephanie Plum fans have been looking for the books to go on film.  I saw it the first time with another fan in the theater when it was first released.  As with some others we were not very impressed with some of the casting: I was expecting Ranger to be much ""hotter"" and to be more amused by Stephanie's continual dramatic situations and how she always seems to minimize them and come out of them OK. In the books Ranger usually acknowledges the danger he finds her in with a simple ""Babe"" and a slight lift of an eyebrow or an ""almost"" grin, this I think was the fault of the director not the actor, but of course this was the first book and the very beginning of their friendship.  As the books progress so does their relationship.  I had pictured Grandma to be much older and frail looking. etc.,since none of my seventy plus friends go to viewings unless they are family or friends.  I thought Katherine Heigl was fine as Stephanie and Lula and Connie were well cast. But all in all I enjoyed the movie, however I think there were a few more funny scenes that should have been included.  Read the books and judge for yourself.

On this second viewing, I was more comfortable with the characters as cast so I could just relax and enjoy the movie for what it is, an enjoyable escape.",1385942400,,1509,4.322695035460993

Maybe I have a much more active imagination but I found the characters of Joe and Ranger looked and acted nothing  like their counterparts  in the  book. Sherry Shepherd did do a good job with Lula.

4346564,4,B004EPYZRG,Fun movie though the books are much much better. The casting through me some as they don't realy fit the characters in the books. Especially Joe and Ranger.

I think probably my mind changed for two reasons.  First I had not read any Janet Evanovich's books.  I have now read others books in this series and love them.  So when I watched this movie I could identify with the characters better.  Two.. I think this movie would have been much better made for a TV movie then the big screen.

Stephanie is a short, Italian-American with teased hair...nothing remotely like the tall, blonde Ms. Heigl whose non-existent Italian accent is a joke.  My husband sweet-talked me into watching the movie on Netflix.  It was a huge disappointment.  The characters just don't fit the ones in the book.

The chemistry between Stephanie and Joe seemed to develop throughout the movie as this is somewhat of a love/hate relationship, maybe hate is too strong a word, but definitely anger.

4347360,4,B004EPYZRG,"I am a hardcore Janet Evanovich fan, so I was thrilled to see her first novel ""One for the Money"" make it to the big screen.

I liked the movie. It was well-crafted and well-acted. I watch a lot of movies, so I paid attention to the details. The dialogue was crisp, lean, funny and moved the story forward. Same with the direction, scenes did not drag.

Katherine Heigl did a fairly good job playing Stephanie. She captured Plum's evolution from department store clerk into a bounty hunter well. She played the ""I am out of my depth here"" with bravado.

I liked all the characters. In some movies, the secondary characters are lost in the background. What I really enjoyed about this movie was that all the secondary characters were well-cast and played a significant part of the story, even if the part was small like Leonardo Lam's character, John Cho. He was in one scene as a humorous drug user but he was memorable.

It was hard to decide which secondary character I liked best, Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur was great; Daniel Sunjata as Ranger was yummy and he knew how to deliver his lines; Sherry Shepherd was the perfect Lula; and Patrick Fischler and Ana Reeder were great as Vinnie Plum and Connie.

But Nate Mooney, who played Eddie Gazarra, Stephanie's police officer friend, was my favorite. He had great energy, facial expressions and body language. I liked the way he interacted with Katherine Heigl's character, Stephanie Plum.

If I had any complaints it would be that the chemistry between the characters, Plum and Morelli just wasn't there for me.

But, I want to see more of Stephanie Plum and the gang on the big screen but from what I have heard the movie rights have been sold and I don't see any plans for future movies. Darn.",1379894400,,1754,4.602564102564102

I just love Jason O'Mara on the old TV shows he was in (""Men in Trees"" sticks out in my mind), and he is not what I pictured as Joe Morelli from the book.

I couldn't imagine who they would choose to cast as the main characters. Sandra Bullock would have been perfect as Stephanie when the series started. But since the first movie didn't appear until after the 14th or 15th book was written, Sandra is now too old to play the character. Katherine Heigl is a perfect choice. Joe and Ranger were so sexy in the books, and the guys who were chosen for the movie were good choices. Grandma Mazur is the funniest character in the books, and Debbie Reynolds plays her well, but there wasn't enough of her in the movie. Same with Lola. Her transition from hooker to office worker was done in the blink of the eye.

The fact that it tried to be the story but I couldn't wrap my head around the discrepancies...Stephanie is Italian/Hungarian...Heigel just didn't cut it...there were more but itemizing is not needed.
Actually watched it a second time just to see if it was just a fun story w/o the history and it still was lacking, just from the interaction of Heigel and her co-stars.",1377475200,,496,4.712643678160919

Other wise most of the actors worked and I thought the movie was great even thought it took them this long to finally make a movie from her books. The interesting thing is people knew that Katherine H. was the actress and they still watch and if she comes out with more of stephanie plum I will go to see them to.

I was excited to watch a movie about this hilarious book in the Stephanie Plum series; however, I was really disappointed with the casting and the abridged version of the story!

Stephanie is a brunette with blue eyes and curly brown hair.  Joe Morelli is a sexy italian cop, not irish and ranger a sexy cuban with long hair and a pony tail.

The actors are nice looking, but didn't fit the roles in either their looks or acting.  I would like them to try it again with a different cast, if they get it right...a lot of money could be made from franchising this book series into movies.

I think Alessio Boni would be a great Joe Morelli.  I like William Levy or David Fumero for Ranger and for Sephanie Plum...Annie Wersching,  Kristen Stewart, Alexandra Deddario or Amanda Peet would all fit the part better..  I love the idea of Betty White for Grandma Mazur! LOL.

I've watched a few times, great light and entertaining when you can't sleep.

Janet Evanovichs' writing style comes across well. I hope they do more, I think the public, who haven't read the books, will catch on quick and like it.

It has some language and adult-rated scenes, so is not for younger folks, but I was surprised at the story, the humor, and the acting that made for an enjoyable movie.

She got her personality and quirks just right, and all without affecting a totally fake New Jersey accent.  And as for Ranger and Morelli, they are just about exactly how I pictured them while reading.  ""Yummy"" is all I can say!

The movie had the same trademark humor as the book, and I found myself laughing out loud several times.  I wondered how they would handle the plot, if the plot from book one was enough to base a movie on, and it was.  As far as I can remember (it's been a couple of years since I read One for the Money), the movie stayed true to the book.  In fact, watching One for the Money made me want to read the book again, which is an indicator of a successful book-to-movie adaptation.

If you have not read any of the Stephanie Plum books, watching One for the Money is a great way to tell if you'll like the series.  I give the movie (and books) a strong recommendation!",1373760000,,1068,4.211822660098522

Nevertheless, it gave me a warm feeling in my tommy to realize that I did not buy, nor rent this movie, because aside from the hour and a half of my life that  I'm not getting back, it would've been particularly painful to realize that this would've been a tragic investment of my money.

The bizarre-o casting misses the mark all the way across the board (was anyone else picturing Estelle Getty from the Golden Girls for Grandma Mazur?). Ranger was a no, Joe was a no, Heigl as a Plum was a HUGE NO. Heigl's monotone, lifeless narration does nothing for the pace of the movie, which is slow and nowhere near as exciting as the books.

Katherine Heigl was fair in the lead role but terrible casting on the parts of Morelli and especially Ranger. No chemistry in either case with Stephanie.

Debbie Reynolds was too young as Grandma. Mrs. Plum didn't work although Mr. Plum was pretty good.

Vinnie, Connie, and Lula were the best casting although Lula wasn't big enough.

After seeing it all the way through with my husband we knew we had to own it.  It is funny and Katherine Heigl is great in it.  I was afraid my husband would consider this a chick flick but there was enough male action and action all the way around that he said he wanted me to find it and add to our collection of about 300 dvds.  It was funny without sacrificing a good script for stupid fx's.  Katherine Heigl is feminine enough to be believable without being macho and yet strong enough to believe a woman in her situation could do those things.

Don't get me wrong, Katherine Heigel did what she does best-act cute, sassy, and distressed at the same time; but I really couldn't buy the weak plot and neatly wrapped ending. There were parts I was scratching my head thinking--Stephanie Plum wasn't that stupid and ditzy in the books.
But there were good points- Stephanie doing the time honored tradition of going through multiple cars.

There were cute moments such as when Joe handcuffed Stephanie to the shower curtain or her talking to LuLu; the friendly town hooker. But it still was not as funny and sexy as I wanted. Maybe I was expecting a more attractive Ranger and Joe Morelli and a little more suspense. It was painfully obvious that Nick Alpha was up to no good, part of me wanted to "" pretend"" that he wasn't guilty.

In all honesty the book is always better, or at least different from the movie in some major way. Anyway, I thought it was enjoyable. I liked the characters rough edges and sense of humor.

I don't understand why she fails so miserably when it comes to sexual chemistry.  I know she can do it from watching Greys Anatomy, but her movie characters lack heat.  James Marsden, Gerard Butler, Ashton Kutcher...nothing.

I thought that a Katherine Heigl was a perfect choice to play Stephanie. She is physically attractive enough to attract Joe Morelli and Ranger, but is still sort of a tomboy and can pull of the klutz role that Janet has written for Stephanie throughout the series.

4350944,5,B004EPYZRG,"I am a long time Evanovich fan and I was disappointed with this movie with the first several viewings but I should also say that I felt the same way about the Harry Potter films in the beginning.  The characters weren't the ones in my mind.  They were higher middle class, in particular Debbie Reynolds, who is just far too georgeous to be Stephanie's grandmother, though she plays the part well. Furthermore, I laugh out loud through tears when I read the books and I didn't even snicker through the film so I was left flat. A week later I watched the film again with no expectations and found the acting very good and the film very accurate to the book. The humor is very subtle, dry and low key just like the books but you have more time to react when you are reading. In movies we are so accustom to special effects and action that we miss the subtle humor but it is here it just takes multiple viewings to slow your brain's pace to appreciate the human artistry.  I regret that the poor intial viewing from fans will possibly prevent additional movies of this book series because the cast is good and the chemestry is excellent once you get past your own expectations.  Very much like the ""Harry Potter"" phenomena to me. I HIGHLY recommend this film.",1371254400,,1255,4.443478260869565

4351111,3,B004EPYZRG,"I have been a big fan of the Evonavich novels from very early on. One for the Money, as a book, made me laugh out loud and I have been hooked ever since.

I really really really wanted to like this movie. I started watching this movie expecting to like it. I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I like a lot of the actors in this movie, I enjoyed the books bunches and I thought that this had the potential to be a fun, exciting, funny, enjoyable movie.

Boy was I dissapointed.
And what makes it worse for me, is I believe that even had I not read the books and not been prepared to enjoy this movie; had I just gone into this movie with no expectations I would probably not have enjoyed the movie very much.

Everyone who has read the books has played the 'who would be a good Stephanie, who would play Ranger etc' game. My problem was not really that I would have picked different people for the movie. My problem was that the movie moved slow and you never got the tension and gritty feel that I expected. Also, for the largest part of the movie I didn't see the zings and pops that I expected to between the main three characters.

Other reviewers are correct- a lot of the details from the book/s are in the movie. The nicknames the men have for Stephanie, Lula, the big blue car etc etc. It was fun to sit and watch this show for that reason. It was neat to have a scavenger hunt of 'that is in the book'.

But overall, this movie moved slow. The chemestry between the men and Stephanie was lacking.

Maybe the problem was that someone paid too much attention to the details of the book and didn't pay attention to the 'feel' of the book?

Eitherway, this is not a big waste of time. It's a cute little movie but compared to the book it simply did not live up to the expectations I had in place.

I would love to see a sequel because I can see how the movies would improve as time goes on.
I'm afraid though that there simply won't be a sequel because this movie didn't quite make it happen.

Enjoy.",1370563200,,2012,4.164948453608248

Nothing against the male lead actors per se, they just didn't match with the books. Joe Morelli is Italian, dark eyes, hair...Ranger is BIG, like Dwayne Johnson big---tall, broad and major muscles. This version has a fair-complexion, blue eyed Joe with a toned, but average height Ranger.

However, watching it recently, I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed the movie. Katherine Heigl and Jason O'Mara were terrific. They also had wonderful onscreen chemistry. And Ranger and Lula? What great characters! The actors who played them were wonderful.

There probably won't be a sequel to this Stephanie Plum movie, but if there were, I'd go see every one of them - and buy the DVDs!  One for the money was really fun and sexy.  If you enjoyed Gerald Butler and Katherine Heigl in ""The Ugly Truth"", you'll enjoy ""One for the Money.""",1370131200,,641,4.605263157894737
4351290,4,B004EPYZRG,"I had friends who I have turned on to the Plum series tell me the movie was awful. I myself thought the casting, when I first read about it, was awful. Reviews of the movie by people who had never read any of the books said it was awful and they didn't have anything but the movie itself to go by. SO I waited until I got Netflix and watched it for free.  It was funny and very true to the books. I do think the casting of Grandma Mazur was WAYYYYYYY off, Debbie may be funny but she is way too pretty to be Grandma, who is described in the book as skinny with chicken legs. And while he did an OK acting job, the Ranger in the books is way sexier than the guy on film. he doesn't even say 'Babe"" with the right accentuation. (Listen to an audiobook version if you want to hear Ranger say ""Babe"" the right way.)  But the biggest surprise for me was how well Katherine did as Stephanie. IMO she nailed the part!!!!  I was so sure I wouldn't ""buy"" her in the part, but she did a great job!  And while I am pretty sure there were better looking Italian actors out there to play Morelli, Jason did a great job ACTING the part. They just needed to make him a little more brunette and tan for me to really buy him as Morelli, but he is a hunk! in his own right.  My first choice for Lula would have been Queen Latifah (sp???)  but Sherry was also good in the part.  As for the movie itself, once I got past the casting and just settled in for the story I enjoyed it very much.

So while # 1 may have been a disappointment at the box office, if they make book 2 into a movie, I WILL pay to go see it, and that says a lot more than I can say about the most recent books in the series. I won't pay for THOSE anymore, I get them at the library.  The books lost their way after 12 or 13.",1370044800,,1776,3.897506925207756

4351947,4,B004EPYZRG,"The books by Janet Evanovich are certainly better, but I enjoyed this film version of her first Stephanie Plum novel. The script is very loyal to its source material, with only minor cosmetic changes and some resequencing of events thrown in to mix things up a bit. No, it's not an especially dynamic film, but I appreciated its low key approach and was glad not to see it overplay the slapstick or take itself too seriously.

Although considerably different from how I pictured them in my head, I thought the characters were well realized onscreen, and in many cases more appropriate to their book counterparts than what I initially pictured. Katherine Heigl may not have been the ideal Stephanie for a lot of people, but I personally thought she was a fine choice for the role, playing Stephanie not as a New Jersey caricature but as an everywoman thrown into new and challenging circumstances...something all of us can relate to at some point or another. Most importantly, she portrayed Stephanie as being a good person at heart in spite of her occasional ineptitude; someone you'd enjoy hanging out with while sharing a few tasty kakes, all the while knowing she's always got your back if you need her.

The rest of the cast was great as well. It was refreshing to see a film that wasn't jam-packed with big names just for promotional purposes. Each actor seemed carefully selected and appropriate to his/her part. I especially enjoyed Patrick Fishler's Vinnie and Ana Reeder's Connie, who displayed great boss/secretary chemistry during the Bonds Office scenes. Jason O'Mara and Debbie Reynolds as Joe Morelli and Grandma Mazur, respectively, differed the most from their book counterparts, but were nonetheless solid choices who each brought something new to these very established characters.

Sadly, this will likely be the only screen adventure for this incarnation of Stephanie Plum, but I hope appreciation for it grows over time. It may never replace the vision you have in your head, but I encourage you to give this movie a chance. It's a far riper Plum than you might think.",1368748800,,2089,4.9289772727272725

4351951,2,B004EPYZRG,"Considering the quality of Janet Evanovich's writing, this screen adaptation fails to impress.  The dialogue is nowhere near as saucy and brash as that in the book, Morelli is way too polite and Ranger nowhere near mysterious enough - let's not even start on Grandma Mazur.  The best that can be said of this film is that the actress playing Stephanie Plum looks vaguely like the book descriptions, even if Wardrobe hadn't read the book closely enough to get her costumes even close.  This film does not approach the novel's pace and action - if I was Janet Evanovich I would've curled up in shame at what they did to an excellent storyline.  Definitely not impressed, and glad I didn't waste the money on movie tickets for this not even C grade effort!!",1368748800,,754,4.646616541353383

Heigl did a pretty good job, but much as I like Debbie Reynolds, her botoxed and lifted face did not fit the character (I would have cast Chloris Leachman).  Also, Minelli should have been a tall hunk, but he was shorter than Plum and looked much older.  Ranger was too soft a character.  The WORST, however, was Lula.  In the books, she's so hilarious and outrageous that I laughed out loud every single time she spoke.  In the movie, she ended up in a cutsy polka dot dress working at the bondsman's office.  NOT!!!

Not to dis Debbie R., she does an adequate job, but she's not wrinkly, scrappy, and OMG like G-ma is. Sherry Shepard is great as Lula, though: a combination of tough, ""I got this"",  and ""oops"". They also fail to make Ramirez as psycho scary-keep you awake as he is. You'll probably want to watch if you've read the books, but otherwise, nope, not that great.",1368403200,,773,4.405594405594406
4352035,5,B004EPYZRG,I could watch this movie over and over... Katherine Heigl is the best!! And Jason O'Mara is pretty easy on the eyes... Great combination of lead characters!,1368316800,,156,4.814814814814815
4352036,4,B004EPYZRG,Great chemistry to carry a movie with a weak story line but the main actors do it justice. Perhaps they will do another movie with substance and chemistry. Fun fluff.,1368230400,,166,4.566666666666666

4352138,4,B004EPYZRG,"Katherine Heigl is easy to watch in this lighthearted show.  It doesn't hurt that she is easy on the eyes.  Plot is somewhat predictable and corny at times, but overall worth the time.",1368144000,,184,4.545454545454546

This is a comedy that is very well done.",1368144000,,120,4.454545454545454
4352142,3,B004EPYZRG,"This movie will never be compared with Casablanca, and it is a rather weak rendition of the book.  It is not horrible and not a bona fide waste of time.  The characters in the movie don't live up to the characters in the book.",1368144000,,226,4.113636363636363
4352143,4,B004EPYZRG,"""One For The Money"" is a fun filled romp about a woman tracking down the man who ""done her wrong"" when she was 17. Only now she is thirty-ish and a bounty hunter and he's a cop on the lam after breaking his bail bond. Add a dysfunctional family and the fact that the bounty hunter is still attracted to the guy she's tracking down and you've got a lot to take in.
The chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Jason O'Mara, both very attractive and deft at what they're doing, makes a rather flimsy storyline so worth watching. I like the film so much, I watched it twice. If you enjoy romantic comedy with a hint of action and adventure involved, you should find yourself caught up in this titillating tale of a woman getting her man. I recommend it.",1368144000,,747,4.3428571428571425

4352201,4,B004EPYZRG,"You gotta love tough resourceful women- even when they're not too good at it. This story thrusts our heroine into a world she's never known and watches as she muddles her way through skip chasing, bounty hunting, and finally crime solving. Of course she falls in love. Suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. It's a fun movie",1367625600,,323,4.684210526315789
4352202,4,B004EPYZRG,"As a fan of the books, I had high expectations. Overall, I thought it was a good adaptation of the book. Katherine Heigl was perfect as Stephanie Plum, as were the castings for Vinnie (Patrick Fischler) and Connie (Ana Reeder) and several of the other regulars in the series. For me, Debbie Reynolds didn't work as Grandma Masur and Daniel Sunjata was not even close as Ranger. Overall, it was an enjoyable lightweight diversion. I hope the movie made enough money for the producers to continue to adapt other books in the series with Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum.",1367539200,,569,4.757575757575758

4352422,4,B004EPYZRG,"Definitely not how I had Stephanie Plum pictured from the novels, but other than that most of the characters were pretty well cast.  Good story line that stayed close enough to the book to be recognizable, for those of you that read Janet Evanovich.

4352505,2,B004EPYZRG,"I'm not sure what genre this movie falls into.  It was funny.  It wasn't action-packed or suspenseful, so I'm not sure what to call it.  It reminded me of the TV show Bones but funnier.  I love Katherine Hiegl so it didn't bother me to watch and support her. It'd be a great lazy day-off-work movie.  Honestly, if I hadn't ever watched it I would not have felt like I missed out on anything.",1366934400,,391,4.22972972972973
4352506,5,B004EPYZRG,"I've read several of the books in this series, and this movie certainly opens the door for a movie series.  Katherine Heigl was an excellent choice for the lead, and the story was very true to the book.

While this may seem to some as an ""action chick flick"", it really isn't - my boyfriend LOVED it as much as I did, even though he wouldn't go to the theater to see it when it was originally released.

4352509,3,B004EPYZRG,"The downfall of OFTM was itss casting.  Katherin Higel was great and so was ""Lula"" but the other choices for the characters were lacking; especially ""Ranger"".  He should be larger than life and physically empowering like Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson.  The guy that played Morielle (sp) was not quite the Italian stud as depicted in the book.  Evanovich has a wonderful series going here so I hope Hollywood tries again.",1366848000,,419,4.859154929577465

Her accent is horrible and so is her role. She just doesn't do this role. I really loved her in 27 Dresses, but this movie pretty much sucked.",1366761600,5,297,4.418181818181818

4352601,1,B004EPYZRG,An hour and a half of my life that I will never get back. The plot and feel of the movie is very much 80's even though it was released in 2012.  The acting was average at best. I'm not sure why I didn't turn it off. Just a dumb movie.,1366675200,,234,3.588235294117647

I can't quite put my finger on it, but it seemed like it was loosely (and cheaply) put together.  The book, I believe, was set in the 80s, but the movie didn't have an 80s feel at all, not in the style of dress, the cinematography or setting.  I think Katherine Heigl, Jason O'Mara, Sherri Shepherd and all the other actors were good in the movie, but it was the writing or something that just didn't work that well.  If there's going to be a Two for the Dough movie (author, Stephanie Plum's second book in this series), I hope they take their time and do it right with the same actors.",1366416000,,715,4.122302158273381

4352811,3,B004EPYZRG,Disappointed...enjoyed the book far more than the movie. The Stephanie Plum books are hilarious and the movie was rather ho-hum. The only person casted who seemed to fit the role was Sherrie Shepherd as Lula and that part was cut so much that it lost the essence of her role as Stephanie's sidekick. Too much left out about Grandma Mazur as well....,1365465600,,349,4.645161290322581

I rarely smiled in the movie. Lula, played by Sherri Shepherd, should have provided comedy and laughter, but it was too much to put on one actor. This is truly one of those times, as is almost always true, when ""the book is so much better than the movie."" What a shame for Janet Evanovitch!

4352951,3,B004EPYZRG,Wasn't the best.  I guess I had a different view of what all the characters would look like and some of their actions.,1365206400,,118,4.130434782608695

4353113,1,B004EPYZRG,This is an awful movie if you like the books. It is an awful movie even if you have not read any of the books. Casting is so far off as well as the presentation of the charactors. Just plain awful.,1365120000,,197,3.8292682926829267

4353173,5,B004EPYZRG,"I thought the movie was great! However, I think that the last 30 minutes of the movie seemed to be rushed. It seemed like they were in a hurry to end the movie so they slammed it all together into the last 10 minutes. What ever happened with Ranger? I would have thought the storyline would have better. With all that said, it is still a good movie.",1364601600,,349,4.147058823529412

4353177,1,B004EPYZRG,"Wow. Bad, really bad. Rotten tomatoes gives it 2% - which means only 2 out of 100 reviewers liked it - yikes! However after reading some of the reviews here, I figured it might be light fun entertainment - Wrong. Katherine Heigl must be one of the least likely people in the world to be believable as a bounty hunter. She doesn't seem tough enough to be a meter maid let alone chasing down and handcuffing hardened criminals. One more thing - you know a movie stinks when it even makes even Debbie Reynolds look bad.",1364515200,,516,4.385416666666667

4353252,2,B004EPYZRG,I am a fan of the books so I was really looking forward to the movie. Big mistake. Movie did not have the charm and humor of the books. Katherine did not embody the spirit of Stephanie at all.,1364256000,,192,3.948717948717949
4353253,5,B004EPYZRG,"Guilty pleasure. If you know and love the ""Stephanie Plum"" novels, you will LOVE this movie! Gives faces to the characters and depicts them pretty well. Would even enjoy watching a new one on the more recent books (up to #19 now, so there's a lot missing).

Only note - there's no chemistry between ""Stephanie"" and ""Morelli"" or ""Ranger"" (which is a huge part of every book), so I'd probably score it a 4.5 instead.

If you have never read the books, this movie sucks. The people don't make much sense, the story line has holes and there are so many lulls in the action it will get boring.",1364256000,,588,4.385321100917431

4353256,5,B004EPYZRG,Was a lot better than I hoped it would be. My favorite character is Grandma Mazur played by show business legend Debbie Reynolds. She is truly hilarious. Nice that she keeps acting.,1364169600,,181,4.6875
4353257,5,B004EPYZRG,"I was completely expecting to see Katherine Heigl play her usual role.  She did a good job in this role.  The accent didn't really fit her, but hey I'm use to Izzy Stevens.  I will definitely watch this movie again.",1364083200,,215,4.325
4353258,3,B004EPYZRG,Was expecting more like the book.  I didn't like the casting much either. Was okay but not the best in my opinion,1364083200,,113,4.136363636363637

4353355,4,B004EPYZRG,I have read all the Stephanie Plum books. The movie was okay for the people who have not read the books.

4353493,4,B004EPYZRG,I really enjoyed this movie. Of course beautiful Kathrine Heigl really helps the movie. The plot and story line was good. The only thing is of course you could predict the movie outcome.,1363737600,,186,4.666666666666667

4353584,3,B004EPYZRG,"It all depends on why you choose a movie.  If you want a good plot with good acting, this is not it, but if you are just looking to waist some time and like Katherine Heigl then this is ok.  It could be a good tv series, specially because of the secondary characters, which were the best part of the movie for me.",1363564800,,313,3.9523809523809526

A rather tame, low octane romcom about some local gangsters or something.  Could have been a Lifetime movie.  Unless you are a huge Katherine Heigl fan, pass this one up.",1363478400,,290,4.519230769230769

4353588,4,B004EPYZRG,"The movie was quite enjoyable though the action seemed to jump around a lot. But if you are a reader of the book you know that's how they are also. The casting for Morelli and Ranger were very good but I am not sure Stephanie works well with Katherine Heigl. Very pretty but not ditsy enough to be true to the book. That is probably the area of most conflict with the books. Stephanie is inept, go ahead and admit it, and only apprehends by accident. In the movie she was the thinker which is not her strong suit. Even with that I enjoyed the movie and would not mind seeing a series made from the books.",1363478400,,604,4.170940170940171

4353591,4,B004EPYZRG,"For fans of this book series, it's fun to see the characters on the big screen. That being said, I really think some of the casting and portrayals missed the mark. For example, Ranger is described in the book as a big muscular guy of few words. ""Babe"" generally says it all for him. Don't get me wrong, the actor they used is very good looking, just not what I envisioned based on the books. I was expecting someone more like ""The Rock."" I don't know if what they put out is enough to get people asking for more, which is too bad because there are some great story lines in the later books and it would be great to see more of Lula...Sheri Shepard is great.
Bottom line...worth watching if you like the books.",1363392000,,709,4.2592592592592595

4353694,1,B004EPYZRG,"I don't know if I can describe just how bad Katherine Heigl is as Stephanie Plum. One of the worst casting choices ever, she has no warmth, quirky charm or humor and is completely unbelievable. The actors playing her family are equally miscast. The movie overall was so bad it was painful to watch",1363305600,,297,4.518518518518518

4353697,5,B004EPYZRG,"With action and comedy all packed into one, you really can't go wrong with this movie. It was very entertaining with its balancing contrast of humor and adventure which is something you don't find in a lot of movies",1363305600,,215,4.538461538461538

4353788,1,B004EPYZRG,"Katherine Heigl is beautiful, no doubt about it. But that doesn't mean that she can act. And this ""comedy"" is another in a series of movies Ms. Heigl has done that shows that. Her male counterpart, Jason whatshisname, is just the lastest in a series of actors that she hates at the beginning but is warmed up to by the time the ending credits roll.

I spent the whole movie hoping that it would get better and it didn't. She has some sort of problem that needs to be addressed. Along comes this guy she hates who also represents an opportunity to overcome her problem. They fight. They argue. Somewhat funny things happen. Then a crisis comes up and the two of them overcome them and realize they like each other. maybe just a little. Maybe a lot. That's why I didn't like The Ugly Truth.... I mean Killers....

Morrelli is Butt Ugly, too short, and not remotely Italian. Debbie Reynolds, while a fine actress, is desperately miscast as the skinny gun toting granny in spandex, and Lulu wasn't really even fat. Even Vinny was nothing like described, all in all, a serious disappointment, and nothing her fans can enjoy, save an hour and a half and watch something else, or better yet, just read the books.",1363132800,,578,4.908163265306122

4353892,3,B004EPYZRG,"As others have said, this movie is cute, but not laugh out loud funny. You may grin, but not laugh.

Really, the only reason to watch is to see Katherine Heigl's backside in tight jeans and a nude scene in the shower (although they don't show you much). The other characters try to be funny but they are predictable (the mother that says her daughter needs a husband, the wise cracking office girl, the ex-boyfriend that did her wrong, the attempted fix up with a nerdy friend of the family, etc.). We'll all seen this before. Granted, Heigl is pretty good looking, but $12 Million for a movie like this ? That's amazing.

4353991,3,B004EPYZRG,"Die-hard Stephanie Plum fans are bound to be disappointed, but even those who don't know the books will see that there's a lot wrong with this film. All the leads were badly miscast -- Katherine Heigel has no comic instincts and keeps forgetting that she's a Jersey girl, Jason O'Mara is way too Irish and not nearly sexy enough to play Joe Morelli (no chemistry with Heigel, either), Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur -- what were they thinking? At least they cut most of her scenes. The actor who plays Ranger was far too expressive -- he even smiles several times to show off his dimples. Too bad the guy hadn't read a couple of the books -- he would have known that Ranger never smiles and is cool as ice, which is what makes him so smokin' and a nice foil to Morelli. In contrast to the miscast leads, however, most of the secondary characters were actually well-cast, and did a pretty good job with the material.

The script stinks -- in the climactic scene I guess the screenwriter really needed to cram in a bunch of exposition to cover info that was in the book. The bad guy, just before he's about to kill our leads, very conveniently explains everything that he did, how he did it, and how he's planning to kill them, too -- just before he himself gets killed. The director is lucky to have gotten a job. He may never get another one, though -- the pacing is uneven, the tone vacillates between badly done comedy and badly done suspense, with a lot of slack in between.

Having said all that, I was anticipating something even worse. I gave it three stars mostly out of relief that it was quite as bad as I had expected. People who watch lots of comedies of recent manufacture probably won't even notice how sub-par this thing is, because it's better than a lot of them (which isn't saying much). So if you're looking for a comedy that doesn't have a lot of sex, profanity, potty humor and the like, you may enjoy this film. Just don't get your hopes up too high.",1362873600,,1973,4.402739726027397

4354481,3,B004EPYZRG,"It's trendy to pick on this movie, and who am I to buck a trend? So make room in the bandwagon. To see ONE FOR THE MONEY is to see Janet Evanovich's hopes for a film franchise evaporate like morning dew after sunrise or one's confidence in Katherine Heigl in a non-romcom picture. Janet Evanovich's novels featuring barely competent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum are bestselling stuff, so chances are, once that odor goes away, there'll be another crack at a cinematic adaptation. Because if the Punisher merits second and third chances, why not Stephanie Plum?

The quirky premise would've nudged my bump of curiosity, except I was already familiar with the book. Bad cess to Stephanie Plum. She's newly divorced and recently laid off from her lingerie manager post at Macy's, and so the fundamental law of threes made that eviction notice a thing of inevitability. And if you think about it, that she lives in Trenton, New Jersey fulfills the fundamental law of fours.

Stephanie Plum is so hard up she takes a dead-end job at her sleazy cousin's bail bond business, never mind that she has no experience whatsoever at skip tracing. But she has gumption and a certain doggedness and an obliviousness to potential danger. Stephanie doesn't waste time with the low-rent FTA (""Failure to Appear"") cases. She sets her sights on the biggest bounty which happens to be her ex-flame Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara), he to whom Stephanie had once given her cannoli (this is probably a euphemism). Morelli, a cop accused of murder, claims innocence. He's on the lam and desperate to clear his name. Stephanie Plum would rather not be evicted. The chase is on.

A middle-of-the-road 2.5 out of 5 stars for ONE FOR THE MONEY. This movie has gotten more trashed than Hefty, more shunned than a smoker in California, more ridiculed than Erik Estrada speaking Spanish in a telenovela. But, dangit, I have got such mad love for Katherine Heigl I don't have it in me to dish dirt on her. I think she did okay stepping outside her purview and I enjoyed her stab at playing the hapless action heroine, even if it took me a minute to adjust to her, um, Jersey accent. Let me instead mention the enervating effect brought on by a shoddy screenplay that weakly adapts and diminishes what was originally a crackling Evanovich read. I don't know that I'm articulating this right, but while there are some funny bits peppered throughout, there's this overall discouraging sitcom-y feel that cheapens the film. And, yeah, okay, maybe Heigl is equally to blame for the lack of chemistry between her and O'Mara. I'm a fan of the books (the earlier ones) and I don't think the PG-13 rating serves Stephanie Plum very well. The movie version of Stephanie is toned down from the saucy badasss recovery agent I'd so relished in literary form. But I like looking at the bright side, so there's this: At least ONE FOR THE MONEY is better than a) that Aniston/Butler mess and b) Erik Estrada speaking Spanish at you.

Okay, everything in this film is absurd. But somehow that doesn't matter. The film is still fun to watch because Heigl has a certain charm, maybe charisma. I would put it in the TV A-Team category.

It's like Evanovich just changes the order of the first 20 sentences in every book.  (Seriously, yo, this ain't Shakespeare.)  If the author goes to such <ahem> pains to share these details over and over and (19! NINETEEN!! times) over, you'd think they'd be in the movie.  (I think I can let go of the '53 Buick; they're a bit pricey.)  But seriously... They couldn't find a duplex for the Plum family?  An old brick apartment house for Stephanie?  Heck, contact lenses weren't in the budget?  I could actually handle Katherine Heigl as Stephanie (contacts and maybe the sneakers she wears in all NINETEEN books would have helped), but I have German in-laws who look (and sound) more Trenton Italian than the rest of the cast.

The books are great and the movie could be too if they stuck more to the book.  Grandma Mazur is a hoot, but wasn't in the movie.

Stephanie's future love interests weren't nearly as hot as depicted in the novels, but they have potential and I'm looking forward to seeing them in future movies as the series progresses... Does anyone know if more movies are planned?

Everyone else in the film was okay.
I felt like other characters would have been better developed and the humor and intensity could have been better when needed but its just one of those movies you don't feel like you wasted time on because you find yourself slightly amused...however for Katherine Heigl's acting skill it was probably her worst role to date. I could see a no name actress making this movie into something but heigl may have brought the audience but trust me it failed to hold.
The plot was okay-Could have been better just like the acting but not at all the worst thing you'll ever sit through.

I think there are about twenty Plum books in all so I'll keep out of trouble for a long time!

The movie is a keeper for me because I found it easy to to root for Stephanie Plum. There aren't many women who seem genuine in movies, for some reason. I also appreciated the funny quirks in dialogue, I thought the story moved along well, the music was great for a ""gumshoe"" movie, and it never got too heavy-handed. I love the way Stephanie Plum narrates throughout the movie. The accents are funny, too! Do they really sound like that in Trenton?

4355268,2,B004EPYZRG,"""One for the Money"" was a huge disappointment.  I bought this DVD at Amazon.com expexting to sit down to a great movie due to some of the reviews and I wondered if we watched the same movie.  I tried twice to finish this movie about one of my favorite books. I just could not get through it. Katherine Heigl was so-so as Stephanie Plum.  No real fire. Jason O'Mara as Morelli was just not good at all.  Neither was Sunjat as Ranger. I kept getting Morelli and Ranger mixed up as to whom was in the shot.  Finally Ranger had a dimple that showed and that's how I identified him as Ranger. Ranger is an over the top character in Janet's books and this guy didn't even approach Ranger's persona and good looks that the author always describes.  Debbie Reynods was miscasted and it should have been Elaine Stitch as Grandma Mazr.  The blue Buick was not even the right year that the author described in book after book. (You think we wouldn't notice?)  Stephanie's father was just right and her mother was okay too.  If they make any more movies of Janet Evanovich's books, please get a gorgeous Ranger and make enough difference between Ranger and Morelli so I know who is who.  The woman who played Lula was totally wrong. She needed to be fatter and taller.  As a published author and one who has sold a book for a movie, this scares me as to who will be hired for the characters I've created.

Lots of technical errors as well.  If you are a police film person you really need to lower your expectations when you watch this one.  I read through a bunch of the multi-star reviews and it seems the vast majority all read the books.  I would guess they are filling in the shortcomings of this film with their memories, familiarity and fondness of the characters in the books thus making the film seem better to them than it really is.  I found myself watching to see how many tech errors I could pick out and how many absolutely unrealistic plot twists would take place rather than to be entertained.

The acting was good, the suspense was enough to keep you going throughout the entire film and it was wrapped up nicely at the end. I liked the fact that they were able to add humor to elements of seriousness. It was a good film. There were probably some unrealistic elements, but for the most part the film was believable enough to be able to suspend my disbelief for it. I also liked that despite the humor of the film, it was able to talk about and discuss crime in a somewhat serious manner.

4355847,3,B004EPYZRG,"Some time ago I discovered the works of Janet Evanovich. While considered lightweight by some, I found her sense of humor to be worth the time spent. Simply put, I loved her books.

I was quite excited when I found that her first book, 'One For The Money' had been made into a movie, and looked forward to seeing it. In one sense I wasn't disappointed. Most of the things that made the book fun were there: Grandma Mazur and the turkey, Mom's constant fretting, Morelli, Ranger, Lula and even ""I sold him a canoli"". 'Big Blue' is there, and is a Buick but seems to be from the mid-'60s rather than a '53, which is disappointing.

All that said, there's something lacking, and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. It's not the actors, who all do a fine job. Is it the writing? The direction? I don't know. I'm not very good at judging these things. It seemed to me that the heart's not there, the soul is missing. The scenes all seem to be just that: scenes in a movie. The story moves, but it doesn't flow. I liked it, but I didn't love it the way I did the book.

Three stars and ""Its Ok/Its Cute"" pretty much sums up this movie. Its kinda funny but not hilarious. It has some action, but nothing special. The movie relies more on the romantic tension between Heigl and O'Mara.

Heigle nailed the character of Stephanie, and the characters of both Ranger and Morelli were perfectly cast. The movie really captures the fun of the books, but it's solid enough to stand alone even if you've never heard of or read the series.

4356023,5,B004EPYZRG,This movie is so entertaining and suspenseful too.  Katherine Heigl gives a superb performance.  Lots of action.  Romantic comedy plus much more.,1359504000,,145,5.5
4356024,5,B004EPYZRG,"Fun to watch when I was home alone. I laughed and smiled a lot. The main character was pretty. The supporting actor was from Terra Nova. This show was not like Terra Nova at all, but I did like Terra Nova. It was a little gruesome though, but some people had a happy ending, and I'm craving Italian food a little more now. I wonder if the main character really puts that much seasoning on food...",1359504000,,396,4.223684210526316
4356025,2,B004EPYZRG,"I don't think even one shot (except the beginning where they show the Trenton Makes bridge) was actually from Trenton, NJ.  They also gave all of the characters a ""North Jersey"" accent and look.  Trenton is decidedly ""South Jersey"" and has its own dialect, similar to a Philadelphia and not New York accent.

With all of that said Heigl is of course super hot but the rest of the movie is lacking, and most of the comedy was left in the book. (Pretty good read)

They had a scene in a shooting range with assault rifles painted on the outside, a real laugher.  One, there is no shooting range anywhere near Trenton and assault type rifles have been illegal here since the 80's.

Pros:
Heigl is 5'9"" and gorgeous.

Cons:
Everything else.",1359417600,,736,4.53030303030303

I need to write more so it can post my review...

Some inate problems with the characters:
1. Katherine Heigl's too pretty
2. Debbie Reynold's too pretty
3. Sherrie Shepherd's too pretty
4. Daniel Sunjata looks like he's 12 and not pretty enough...sorry Danny.
5. Jason O'Mara is pretty but too old...sorry Jason.

4356116,1,B004EPYZRG,"Between the narration of every event we see on screen (""It was easy to tail his car because it was bright red""), Heigl's unplaceable affected accent, and lifeless directing, this movie is simply unwatchable. It's not terrible, which at the least would be an interesting trainwreck, but is unambitious and lacking in style. The narration, particularly, drags the movie down, and seems to treat the audience like they have never seen a movie before and might have trouble linking one seen to the next without a recap of the plot and how the next scene fits into it.",1358726400,,563,4.755102040816326

Haven't read any of the Plumb books but being an avid reader I will now want to read the whole series.  I agree with another reviewer that this would make a great series for TV.  Fun and entertaining.,1358640000,,277,4.169811320754717

4356201,4,B004EPYZRG,"I read Evanovich many years ago, and liked her Plum series.  Call me a cynic, but when I saw her debut had been movie-ized, I didn't expect much.  In fact, I expected schlock.  But on a slow evening, I took a chance.  And I'm glad I did.  Hardcore fans of any novel sometimes need to be reminded that a movie is a different medium; there is much less opportunity for both character development and exposition.  With that in mind, I was mostly looking for the right casting and direction of the Stephanie Plum character.  I thought Heigl nailed it.  She was klutzy, yet sexy, yet not a runway model.  She was often under-confident, but pushed back when pushed.  Apparently, the author agrees with me, per imdb.  The supporting characters got less attention, but if there are to be more movies, that's fine.  I thought the guy playing Ranger was about 75% as ominous as he should have been, and they never got around to playing him off Morelli.  The story arc wobbled a few times, but hung together.  I now see that the film lost money, so it's unlikely we'll see Two for the Show.  But I'd watch it.",1358467200,,1098,4.447236180904523

If you're not a Stephanie Plum fan, I can't say that you'll enjoy the movie, especially if you're a big macho guy.  It's a chick movie... based on a chick book.  And there are a lot of things you are aware of from reading the books that don't necessarily come across in the movie.",1358208000,,369,4.083333333333333

4356204,2,B004EPYZRG,"I am a native of Trenton, and I gave up on this movie halfway through.  It has no allegiance to Chambersburg, where the novels are set, and has no idea how people from Trenton speak.  They all sound like New Yorkers, which is never the case.  Aside all that, Kathryn Heigl is poorly cast, as is Debbie Reynolds, and indeed the rest of the cast.  I've seen television episodes better directed and shot like this bore fest.",1358035200,,421,4.428571428571429
4356205,1,B004EPYZRG,"This was such an awful movie. Heigel comes along as a single loser living in Jersey desperate for any job. Instead of rationally taking small jobs she's determined to go after some guy with a large price on his head whom she apparently attempted to run over with a car in high school?! Also, her Jersey accent was horrible. All Jersey accents are horrible. Between her craptastic acting skills, the prostitutes,  and the dismally predictable ending - wow this movie was a huge waste of my time.",1358035200,,494,4.67816091954023

I don't mind Katherine Heigl, but the accent is terrible and the fact that she's continuously narrating her own actions is incredibly annoying, especially when she's pointing out obvious things that don't need to be narrated.  I don't need you stating that a car was yellow when I can see that for myself.  Only reason it didn't get 1 star is because the grandmother is pretty funny with the few parts she has 30 minutes into the movie.",1358035200,,558,4.346153846153846

I know all those of us who are faithful fans from the first book all have pictures in our minds of what the character look like. I can say with certainty that no Stephanie Plum fan pictured Hiegel in the role. I was disappointed in all the casting because I like what I see in my mine's eye. I was so afraid the movie would make me toss all my books. Fortunately it didn't. I found that after time, Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, Lula were all back just the way I imagined them. Thank goodness the movie didn't ruin it for me, but I fear the effect the movie has had on the ""unPlumed.""

I just wanted to add that I'm in shock that Katherine Heigl gave up a lucrative job on Grey's Anatomy for a stinker like this. She definitely doesn't pull off this role convincingly, and her accent comes and goes constantly. She's much too talented to be wasted in something like this turkey.

I would have liked to get a little more back-story on his and Stephanie's relationship. I love their banter and the insults. I may have to read The actual book series if it has as much wit and sarcasm as this movie. I really liked it. It was really more of a mystery flick than an action or romance flick.

I made it through twenty minutes and turned it off. No one in the roles made sense. From the terrible Jersey accents to the non-Italian actors, it was a disaster. I don't know what the casting director was thinking when they put this group of actors together to make this movie. Not one of them fit their part. Do not waste your time on this mess.

Yeah it's watchable ....if you don;t have anything better to do like read the book. I had read the reviews so I was ready to be disappointed & sometimes casting that I think will be horrible turns out to work or not matter to the movie but in this case Heigl -who I have enjoyed in other roles and movies- is just wrong for this part. The supporting actors from her family members to her cousin/employer are good and almost carry the movie in spite of Heigl's lackluster performance. Too bad they didn;t take a chance on a newer more unknown actress who could then carry the series forward in future movies. If they do make a second Plum movie they should really re-cast her part. I don;'t regret watching this movie -- it has some good moments -- more towards the end when Heigl seems to get a handle on her character-but I do regret that it could have been SO much better.",1356739200,8,1180,4.488372093023256

This movie did cause me to purchase the book, and I can see how the relationship develops in the series (I now have book 2 of the Stephanie Plum series).

Morelli is all wrong - he is Jersey Shore Italian and in ""19"", Evanovich says that when he wears a suit he looks like a casino pit boss.  Try again.  Vinnie is not slimy enough, Grandma Mazur is too young and pretty.  Did you ask Janet Evanovich to approve these choices?  I like Lula, Connie and Stephanie.  You are close, take another crack at it - but remember, Ranger is NOT a nice guy, he is a mercenary.  Grandma Mazur is not sexy, she is old and a little loopy.

I thought the guy who played Joe did a good job. Not the right physical description but the right attitude. Heigle did what she does with all her roles she turned plum into a high strung obnoxious person with a really bad jersey accent.

4356866,2,B004EPYZRG,"I read ""One for the money"" many years ago, so I was excited when I heard the movie was coming out. When will I learn that movies adaptations from books generally don't work. Here are a few reasons why this one didn't...

Katherine Heigl- typically I like her in roles, but I don't think this was a good fit. For someone supposed to be from New Jersey, I had a hard time believing her character. Sure she gave the obligatory few New Jersey-esque catch phrases, but the rest of the dialogue sounded like normal Katherine Heigl. I swear someone said ""learn to say these phrases like this and everyone will believe you're from Jersey"".

Storyline- I was actually bored during the movie. I think this might have dealt with not believing Katherine Heigl in the lead role, but I was ready to turn the movie off before making it halfway through. My wife seem to be enjoying it more than I did (a major surprise), otherwise I wouldn't have finished it.

Grandma Mazur- From what I remember, this old bird was a bigger part of the story and definitely crazier. She did have a few good scenes (shooting the bird during dinner), but not nearly enough of her went into the movie.

This leaves me wondering, if a sequel was made, would I watch it. Probably not, unless nothing else happened to be on TV and it was a rainy day.",1354838400,,1312,4.431535269709544

4356869,5,B004EPYZRG,I was a fan of the books before this was ever made into a movie. I think many will think it's corny but if you've read the books you will probably approve. I hope they make more of these books into films.,1354147200,,204,3.880952380952381
4356870,1,B004EPYZRG,"I loved the first twelve Plum books so I was hoping I would enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the silver screen but sadly that was not the case. My first issue is with the casting which is beyond awful! Katherine Heigl is terrible as Stephanie; she overplays in every scene and she is completely lacking in any kind of warmth which is one of Stephanie's trademark characteristics. (Let me clear, I am comparing Stephanie and all the characters to the way they were originally wonderfully written in books 1-12 before JE started letting her daughter and ghostwriter simply slap pages together)

Heigl has zero chemistry with the men in her life or with anyone else in the movie. Jason O'Mara is not a bad actor but he was miscast as Morelli. No one so blatantly and quirkily Irish should be portraying a macho Italian cop. Sunjata also fails as Ranger...he isn't good looking enough and he lacks any of Ranger's sensuality, quiet intelligence or strength. He also gets very little screentime in the film which won't make some fans (me included) happy. Grandma Mazur is too young, too well preserved and not eccentric enough. Mr. and Mrs. Plum seem off...she's grating and he's pointless; I just couldn't buy them in their roles.

The only characters who worked were Vinnie, Connie and Lula. The plot deviates from the book and not in a good way since it minimizes the suspense and makes the ending more anti-climatic. The sets were also lackluster...not gritty enough for Trenton.

""One for the Money"" was a great book but it is a terrible disappointment as a movie.",1354147200,63,1575,4.740875912408759

4357054,3,B004EPYZRG,"I saw the trailer and although I did want to see the movie I had my doubts as to whether Hollywood could translate it even remotely. They do not have a good track record putting books to movies, as far as I'm concerned. So, here are my perceptions, being a long-time reader of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum.

First of all, there was a LOT of material from the book, much of it nearly word for word, which does rate high in my book. However, Stark Street wasn't really described for what it was in the books. (an incredibly dark and dangerous area) It sort of showed it but seemed to be more of an after-thought. They could have done more with some vocalizations of Stephanie's thought processes, she has some rather interesting ones and some are truly laugh-out-loud funny. I was rather iffy about Katherine Heigle playing Stephanie Plum but she actually did a pretty good job. I could see Stephanie Plum in her and that's important.

The character of Vinnie the slimeball was OK although I felt it was a bit off. Connie was perfect, you instantly recignize her and I thought she was great. Lulu was really good too, she has all the ""assets"" described in the book. Ramirez wasn't scary enough, not enough characterization there.

Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mozur? Nuh uh. She's had too much work done on her face, she doesn't ""look"" old enough and she doesn't have Grandma's spark. Big thumbs down in my opinion.

The Plum/Morelli/Ranger triangle needed some work but the male actors did a decent job of portraying their roles. Having said that, I definitely don't see THESE male actors in those roles. Ranger wasn't bad enough, sexy enough, and where did Joe Morelli's chocolate brown eyes go? As someone else said, there is nothing to indicate WHY Ranger was so willing to help Stephanie. I kept waiting for something to happen there and it never did. The car blowing up was so Stephanie (you have to read the books to fully get this one. Really!) and Rex was Rex, always in his wheel.

Now we have to move on to Big Blue, the car. BB had lots of character, was clearly a significant aspect of the book BUT was more or less just tacked on to the movie. A late-sixties-early seventies Cadillac?  No, No, NO! BB was a Big Buick, with fins, and a block and a half long. It was a CAR and they really missed that one. Come on, how hard could it be to find one?

All in all, decent entertainment, but probably won't purchase the movie.",1351468800,,2434,4.5181818181818185
4357135,1,B004EPYZRG,"I have had this movie for a while, but due to being busy busy with school and family my first chance to watch it was this weekend.  I opened it up and the DVD was scratched in many places (it looked like it was dragged across a serrated knife-the scratch marks were perfectly even and 2 inches across). Clearly this movie had been returned and resold. I tried playing it in 4 different DVD players and my computer and the dang disk would not work.  I would give the movie 5 stars because I think Katherine Heigl is hilarious, but the company would get a negative 10 if I could. Very disappointed, what a waste of money",1351296000,,618,4.273504273504273
4357136,5,B004EPYZRG,I am a fan of this book series so was pretty excited to see the first movie with Stephanie Plum.  While it isn't going to win an academy awards it was a lot of fun!,1351123200,,164,3.6857142857142855
4357137,3,B004EPYZRG,"In ""One for the Money"" Katherine Heigl is Stephanie Plum, a former lingerie buyer-turned-bounty hunter. With her car repossessed, the down-on-her-luck Stephanie takes a job at her cousin Vinnie's bail bonds office, even though she doesn't know how to use a gun. Then Stephanie chases after Joseph Morelli (Jason O'Mara), a disgraced vice cop on the run, with whom she had a relationship in high school.

That ""One for the Money"" was released after a similar romantic comedy ""The Bounty Hunter"" (with the main characters' genders reversed) may have something to do with the film's failure at the box office. Even so, with an interesting premise that has potential, ""One for the Money"" could have been better, something more entertaining like ""Midnight Run.""

The biggest problem with ""One for the Money"" is that the movie is so middling. It is half-baked as a comedy, action, romance or anything. Slick and fast-paced as it is, the film always feels like something is missing. The relationship between Stephanie and Ranger (Daniel Sunjata), her charismatic mentor/partner bounty hunter, is not fully explored: neither is her friendship with Lula (scene-stealing Sherri Shepherd). John Leguizamo is wasted in a role that should be bigger, and so is Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur.

""One for the Money"" is not bad as some critics might lead you to believe. It is just tame. Tameness is not something we need for the story of a rough and tough bail enforcement agent with a heart of gold.",1351036800,,1486,4.983870967741935

4357142,3,B004EPYZRG,"After having read 12 of the numbered books and now having seen the movie - I think casting had it all wrong. Heigl is not really a Stephanie Plum (Jennifer Aniston could be more like it) even if easy on the eye, Grandma Mazur lacks the crazyness of the book (one shot at the chicken does not make a full performance), Morelli could have been taller, Ramirez could have been weirder, and Ranger was all wrong: not enough Batman, to talkative, not tall enough, wrong hairstyle, not mysterious enough. Connie is OK, Lula could have been another actor coming to my mind (Queen Latifah would have been my favorite), Vinnie was also OK. If not really nail-biting as a movie I could imagine making a series out of it, with another cast. Could easily be 5-8 seasons! Shoot it in Trenton, show the in-your-face attitude, pollution, cakes, viewings at Stiva's (would be a highlight!), Stephanie's mother serving meatballs, Burg grapevine and so on.

Jason O'Mara is excellent as Morelli, Katherine Heigl is OK as Stephanie Plum but Daniel Sunjata as Ranger is dreadful. Talk about lacking personality and lacking chemistry with Heigl, wow! John Leguizano, who plays the villan, would have been a better Ranger even if he's too old for the part. At least he has a personality. The movie also doesn't capture writer Evanovich's wonderfully zany sense of humor. Sherri Shepard as Lula is a pleasant surprise in a too-small role.",1349827200,,572,4.846938775510204

However, I like Katherine Heigl and was looking for a light movie to watch so I gave it a try. I found the movie to be very funny in a tongue in cheek way and found the characters to be very endearing (except for the Jason O'mara character which I thought was awkward). Ended up watching the movie twice in the 24 hour rental and found myself wishing I could watch the characters in a different storyline. Wish they would do a second movie though that's unlikely seeing that the movie didn't recoup it's budget.

Not sure about Joe Morelli - had a different vision of him based on book (dark eyes, etc).  Pace was good.  Overall, I would watch this movie again.

Sorry but the male leads were no where near HOT or SEXY. They didn't have the wit, charmisa & timing that was there in the printed form. Female lead was ok , but again i wasn't all that impressed with her acting or interactions with Ranger or Joe. Every book fan of the Plum series must see the movie to formulate their own opinions obviously. Give me a young Mel Gibson or Harrison Ford. George Clooney. Denzel Washington. Even a younger version of Sean Connery. Hugh Jackman. There are A LOT of truly sexy actors with wonderful skills out there. For any future movies ""they"" need to revisit the casting.

At the start of the book, the central character is seriously broke, having recently divorced and also lost her job selling lingerie. Desperate for money, she asks her cousin Vinnie if there are any vacancies in his bail-bond business. There is one opening: as a bounty hunter chasing down people who have jumped bail.

Some of the people she has to find and bring in are relatively easy to deal with, but these don't pay the big bucks. The cases which do tend to be dangerous - such as rogue cop Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara) - who has skipped bail after being accused of murder.

Plum has some old romantic history with Morelli and insists on going after him, even though he is a tough target, way out of the league of a novice bounty hunter. She gets some good advice from experienced bounty hunter Ranger (Daniel Sunjata) but soon finds herself in serious difficulty from some very dangerous people who are also taking an interest in the case. But Stephanie is one girl who is not going to give up easily ...

Also stars Debbie Reynolds in a hysterically funny performance as Plum's grandmother and Sherri Shepherd, an equally funny performance as a streetwalker who is one of her sources of information.

Tight acting and plotting kept the length of the film down to 91 minutes with a good mix of action and comedy, and there was a lot of excellent acting. The chemistry between Heigl and O'Mara was excellent, but her scenes with Daniel Sunjata also crackled with life, so much so that I seriously wondered whether the end to the film would show or hint at Plum forming a romantic attachment to Ranger or Morelli.

Great fun, well worth watching, and although this is based on a series regarded as ""chick-lit"" Katherine Heigl's performance is charming enough that men who watch this with their wives or girlfriends will probably enjoy it as much as their partners do.",1346544000,,3655,6.181102362204724

In an instant and without any experience or on the job training, she becomes a bounty hunter and one of her first targets is an ex boyfriend.  Naturally, she gets in way over her head and the eventual ""will they or won't they"" moment never comes to fruition. Guess Lionsgate was banking on the book series fans to make this some sort of story arch for a movie franchise but since this turned out to be a abysmal flop, that moment is left high and dry.

  I picked up this movie as a blind buy (don't judge me, the store was having a buy 2 for $20 sale and I needed something to go along with my Donnie Darko 10th Anniversary set and they were out of S.

The supporting cast feels completely off, particularly the actors playing the Morelli and Ranger characters, both of whom seem to be wondering what they did to their agent to annoy them enough to land in this picture. The script seems lifeless, as if the energy of the book has been drained completely. Katherine Heigl is the biggest problem of the film. She's completely miscast as the lead character, bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. Heigl isn't at all believable in the part. And she's not at all likeable, in any role she plays, and she turns what was already a shaky movie into a disaster.

4357927,3,B004EPYZRG,"Apparently this movie is based on a book which I have not read, so I cannot comment on how well it portrays the book. As a movie, I think it was OK. The previews and trailers certainly made it seem better than it actually turned out to be. For me, the story sort of lacked zip in some ways and missed out on a number of opportunities. I didn't really like the setting. It was kind of cluttered, drab and depressing and somehow it made it difficult to follow the plot of the movie. Some of the characters in the movie seemed pretty good and well-done, but Katherine Heigl seemed unconvincing as an average Jersey girl. Overall, the movie is a decent watch as far as a cop movie type plot goes. It's not much of a romantic movie and frankly, it's not terribly comical either. I think it would have been a bit better if the bounty hunter aspect had been better developed, if there had been a bit more romantic spark added in and if some of the potentially funny situations had been better-realized. In spite of these shortcomings, it's a watchable film.",1343174400,,1050,4.38974358974359

4357929,5,B004EPYZRG,"My wife and I usually designate one night a week as movie night at home so there has to be a lot of compromise.  I waited with baited breath for the new ""Batman"" movie while my wife likes rom-coms.  ""One For the Money"" satisfied both our individual tastes.  There's enough grit and action for me and light comedy to satisfy her.  I think the strength of the movie lies not so much with the plot but with the rich characterizations none more delightful than Debbie Reynolds as a colorful granny.  It's Katherine Heigl in the central role of Stephanie Plum that holds the film together.  Taking on a job as bounty hunter for her bailbondsman brother she sets her sights on a $50,000.00 pricetag on the head of a rogue cop.  What Stephanie lacks in detective skills she makes up for with pluck and determination.  ""One For the Money"" is engrossing entertainment that should be checked out.  On a side note I live not to far from Trenton, New Jersey where the film is set.  Trenton is the capitol of New Jersey but the film perfectly captures both the working class element of this small big city but also its seedier side.  It's about halfway between Philadelphia and New York and I was trying to ascertain throughout the movie the authenticity of the accents.  A nice touch was Stephanie making reference to her Tastykakes which are a Philadelphia institution.",1342915200,,1358,4.635983263598327

'Money' has right kind of energy and Heigl has the right kind of moxie as newly born retrieval agent Stephanie Plum. But where the rubber meets the road, in terms of the script, is where this flick loses traction.

A lot of that energy is dissipated as various weaker characters steal away the drive that these kinds of movies require. Most obviously: Why is Ranger in the plot at all? I understand that the novels these are based on has Steph torn between whom she's attracted to - but in the film this split interest is emotionally unsatisfying. He doesn't have nearly enough screen time for the audience to make this a true love triangle. Generally, the triangle is very difficult to balance in a scant ninety-minutes of film; few productions do it right. I can think of a half dozen movies from '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Talk-of-the-Town/dp/B000083C8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Talk of the Town</a>' to '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bandits/dp/B00005V4XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bandits</a>' that tanked simply because the filmmakers soft-pedaled conflicted desire, generally making for poor dramatic narrative.

Kind of wished that Director Julie Robinson committed Steph to one side of the street or the other. Meaning she should've completely transformed the character into the leather and hardware FTAs typically employ and enjoy; or pushed Steph's femininity to the max, allowing her to be the goofy sexy girly-girl throughout the film. That she embodied both elements felt artificial and flat.

And, even though I'm not from Jersey, I'm familiar enough with regional accents to recognize that Heigl, despite her best efforts, doesn't have it down. I know from experience, listening to non-locals attempting to sound like one only makes it worse. The equivalent of nails on chalkboard.

Overall, an improvement over the similar Aniston vehicle '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bounty-Hunter/dp/B003QWV652/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bounty Hunter</a>', and made watchable by a very likable cast, especially a wonderfully hilarious performance by Debbie Reynolds, saving the flick from static fluffdom.

Given the to-date fiscal return, I'm sorry that this likely won't produce a sequel. Unfortunate, as I would've paid to screen another effort. There's definitely a seed concept that, properly handled, I believe could develop into something special.",1339718400,,2705,6.317073170731708

4358480,4,B004EPYZRG,I went back and re-read the first book before I went to the movie and was reminded that the first book in the series was a little darker and a little less comedic. I thought this movie was great at introducing us to the characters and I wish it made more money so they would make a sequel so we could really judge how the characters develop on screen.,1339632000,,351,4.101449275362318
4358551,4,B004EPYZRG,"After reading most of the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, I hesitated to buy this movie considering Hollywood's history of botching book to movie projects.  I was pleasantly surprised to get a rather faithful adaptation of the characters and the comic feel of Evanovich's writing.  Katherin Heigle surprised me in her role as Stephanie, because she was actually good and not what I expected at all.  She was tough, but always girly and funny.  I figured they would exclude a character or two in the process, but they're all here:  Stephanie's family, Connie, both Morelli and Ranger, Lula, and even Rex the hamster!

I wouldn't call the movie fall-down funny, but it was definitely enjoyable and mostly true to the books.  I loved the scene with the old naked guy, and the part where Morelli's car blew up and Stephanie asked him if he wanted it back.  I did have a problem with Grandma Mazur(Debbie Reynolds).  Grandma Mazur was much funnier and crazier in the books, which I would have preferred.  I also expected Lula to be fatter and not just pleasantly plump.  A few other things didn't quite sit well, but all in all, this is a good and mostly faithful adaptation of the books, and I encourage you to at least rent it before you decide to buy it.  The movie is great fun, and Janet Evanovich likes it herself if you look at her facebook profile.  Your he-man movie lover may even enjoy it, so there's another thing it's got going for it.  One thing is for sure; my opinion of Katherine Heigl has definite risen a considerable amount.  Good job!",1339459200,,1560,4.621818181818182

Not so with this movie! The actors for each character were perfect and fit descriptions in the book to a T. Dialogue was as snappy and funny as the book, too. And action -- excellent. My husband even enjoyed it.  I loved watching this movie tremendously and hope Hollywood has the rest of the series slated for filming.

I admit that I only got thirty minutes into it before turning it off, preferring to sniffle in silence over wasting a minute more listening to Heigl's atrocious, fake New Jersey accent (and I generally like her as an actress).  I know this is supposed to be frothy, Grrl Power fun, but seriously, the story is insipid, the characters are rediculous stereotypes (Sassy hookers! Sleazy Italian-Americans,), and the humor was just not funny (haha,  Stephanie smells like garbage because she had to dig through a dumpster for her car keys, haha).  Plus, the pacing was off, as if it was butchered in the editing room.  I love Jason O'Mara, but even his accent was rediculous.

The books are lightweight fluff and they are great for listening to on CD as you drive across the country, but this Stephanie Plum interpretation was downright AWFUL!",1339372800,,959,4.781818181818182

4358557,4,B004EPYZRG,"I know there were very mixed reviews about this movie and of course it didn't get any academy awards but it was fun all the same.  I liked Katherine Heigl in the role of Stephanie, the out of work lingerie salesman turned bondsman.  She was sexy, sassy, and funny without trying too hard.  Heigl seems to get away with these roles of being the ""fall girl"" like 27 Dresses, Knocked Up, and now this.  I liked the other actors as well even though most of them were unknowns to me.  Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur was pretty funny but it seemed like she was making too much of an effort to be humorous.  I had pictured someone more wiry, older, and more natural to the role. Morelli's role was spot on character although I'm not familiar with the actor.  I think he showed Morelli's macho, devious, sexy, but definitely out for justice and getting the bad guy cop side.  Ranger was good also as he introduces Stephanie to the gun shooting, lock picking side of bale bonsmanship.  The action scenes were well done without being too violent and the overall filming of the ""burg"" was well done with it's industrial and almost shabby environment with prostitutes thrown in.  Lula  was absolutely a ""hoot"" down to the wardrobe.  I would love to see more in this series where Lula is featured more prominently as she helps Stephanie bring down the ""skippers.""",1339286400,,1352,4.5875

Even if you are a fan of the Stephanie Plum series, you will find this film lacking in story, pacing, and acting ability. The entire cast is miscast and hampered by a poor script that barely captures the likability of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels. Thankfully it will only take an hour and a half of your time to watch this film, so do so if you want a bland diversion for the evening. The film plays out like an incomplete pilot for a TV series which I suspect was how it was originally developed. It has just enough information to introduce the viewer superficially to the characters without really getting to know them. The setting of Trenton, New Jersey is superficial  as well and captures none of the uniqueness of this working-class urban area.",1338681600,,826,4.657534246575342

Even though we didn't get to see her in her full glory while handcuffed to a shower curtain rod, the movie was very entertaining.  She pulled off the innocent girl trying to become a recovery agent.  I haven't read the book, but I am thinking that it might be a good one to read.
The movie didn't come off like an estrogen enriched chick-flick either.  It had action, and plenty of testosterone. I watched it with my girlfriend, and she got just enough romance and I got just enough action.  So if you have a special lady friend, this is a good movie to share.
The supporting cast members also helped make this movie enjoyable.

4358636,4,B004EPYZRG,"As a proud bearer of the Y chromosome, I will freely admit that I wanted to gnaw my arm off and escape when my wife selected this movie to see on our date night.

""Sounds like fun"", I heard myself mutter while inside I was begging for a movie that involved explosions, some action, and some laughs; I would have even settled for a foreign film documentary.  If we could have combined them into a movie of me laughing while I made a pile of foreign film documentaries explode...even better.

It has Katherine Heigl in it who is absolutely gorgeous with darker hair.  I commented on that when I saw the movie poster outside the theater.  My wife threatened to remove my ear with a staple gun if I mentioned it again.  Given that I was sure this movie was going to stink, I took my chances.

So walking in I smiled outside but sulked inside, complied with my wife's wishes and begrudgingly settled into my quasi-comfortable movie seat for what I expected to be 2 hours of retread ""men suck"" jokes and tired expositions about how ""men just don't get women"" and ""I wish they'd take out the trash"" and ""What's their fascination with movies where things blow up?""

And you know what?  I was wrong.

The plot was good.  Heigl played the role well (even if her accent was atrocious) and the grandmother was comedy gold.  There's a few scenes with a lot of skin showing and lots of fun involving handcuffs so...there's that. :)  I was entertained for an hour-and-a-half and came out of that movie glad I went in.

So, guys, if you want to impress your spouse/girlfriend and let them feel like they're getting to watch a movie they want on a ""date night in"", this is not a bad way to go.  Just be sure when she asks you, ""Am I prettier than she is?"" you simply say, ""Of course, my sweet.""  I won't make that mistake again.

True, this flick would have probably played better on HBO or Showtime, but that's only because it is low on explosions and high on old fashioned storytelling--just the opposite of today's usual theatrical popcorn flick. And Heigl is as charming as ever. Too bad wrongheaded critics gang-jumped the film during its theatrical run and destroyed any chance it had for sequels.

The characters as portrayed by Heigl, O'Mara, and Sunjata are exactly as their characters from the first book would be.  Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur, even if she isn't skinny, is great.

With nowhere else to turn to, she takes a job at her cousin Vinnie's Bail Bond as a bail enforcement agent, aka a bounty hunter.

Her first assignment is to bring in a former vice cop Joe Morelli, who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend from high school. And she might have tried to hit him with a car. She is determined to bring him in, but in the process stumbles upon the real killer.

I recall seeing a few advertisements early in the year for One For the Money, mostly with the funny dinner scenes with Debbie Reynolds. After being panned by critics, getting a 2% rating on rottentomatoes.com, and flopping at the box-office, I had no intention of ever seeing this movie. I happened to stumbled upon the DVD last week for under fifteen dollars and I noticed Life on Mars's Jason O'Mara was in it, so I thought I would give it a try. With no expectations, I actually enjoyed the movie for what it is, an innocent fluff despite the short running time of 91 minutes. Katherine Heigl is adorable and has a sparkling chemistry with Jason O'Mara. Debbie Reynolds steals every scene she is in. Now this movie is never going to win any Oscars with its plot, which has several holes, a not-so-great villain and a predictable ending. At times the movie feels less like a theatrical release and more like a television pilot, where it probably would have been more successful.

Except Katherine has a lot more breast to cover, or not be covered. A little too much skin and breast showing to be comfortable having my kids watch it:(",1337731200,6,951,4.660714285714286

I've never seen one that measured up to the written version. This was no exception. BUT, it was still fun! I enjoyed it simply as an addition to one of my favorite series and would recommend it to anyone as such.

Heigl and O'Mara pulled off decent portrayls of Plum and Morelli. Shephard was fun as Lula. The rest of the cast was just okay. Sunjata, though, WAS Ranger. By far my favorite and completely worth watching just for him.",1337731200,,553,4.421568627450981

4359045,2,B004EPYZRG,"Tale is about a woman (Katherine Heigl) who loses her job at Macys as a lingerie manager and in desperation takes on a job as a bail enforcement agent. Don't worry. She's from the working class neighborhood so she can handle herself. The plotting of the story is done well enough but the humor is almost always a miss and the chemistry between the two love interests is generally just average or lower. Debbie Reynolds (a very big deal back in the day) plays the grandmother. The family connection was done somewhat well, too, but man if only the humor and chemistry had been higher this would have been a good or better movie.

This film was based on the 1994 novel of the same name by Janet Evanovich. The budget for this picture was $40M but it only made a bit over $36M at the Box Office (Wiki).

I can't imagine watching it more than once, though. Worth a rent, definitely.",1337644800,,396,4.563380281690141
4359047,2,B004EPYZRG,"This had a decent premise, and I disagree with all the casting complaints, the actors chosen weren't bad. What bothered me was the total lack of depth in the characters and the huge plotting flaws.

On the first point, we see Ms Plum go from a clerk at Macys to a bounty hunter with no discernible effort. The writers at least could have given us the typical montage showing her reading up on arrest technique, practicing with her (highly illegal) snubnose revolver, and trying her hand at lock picking to explain her sudden proficiency at all these skills.

The plot itself was weak and full of holes. Do the authors really think that 'hookers with hearts of gold' roam the streets of Trenton? And that the first two she happens upon conveniently know all about the person she's looking for?

And why, for pity's sake would anyone smuggle large amounts of heroin into NJ by boat when they could land it anywhere else and simply drive it in?

Also a mystery is why a licensed and professional bounty hunter and 'security professional' (Ranger) would even consider making a false firearm purchase for a total stranger, when it would land him in jail as soon as the firearm was found on her (NJ has very strict registration laws). Why would he even talk to her at all, and encourage what could only be considered a suicide mission that was bound to get him in trouble or sued?

I also loved how it was specifically remarked upon (twice) that her revolver was a 'five shot', yet she never shot less than 7 rounds from it at a time.

The description of this movie on Amazon was also dead wrong. In what world they would consider this 'family friendly' I don't know. Within the first 10 minutes she's being told 'there's better ways to earn a living on your knees'. Explain that to the kids (or have them explain it to grandma).

That all being said, it was a relatively fun movie to watch, and the star is definitely easy on the eyes, even if she's not going to win a Best Actress anytime soon. The dialog, while not always logical, was well written and snappy. Overall, entertaining if you like this sort of police romantic comedy.",1337644800,,2128,4.526041666666667
4359048,2,B004EPYZRG,"UPDATED:

I am NJ native who has read and enjoyed (most)of the book series.

The movie was disappointing.  It was missing the wit and humor from the books.  I didn't care for the poor NJ accents and there was too much deviation from the book plotline.",1337644800,,251,4.391304347826087
4359049,3,B004EPYZRG,"This movie is based on a novel which is the first in a series. I suppose the producers of the film were hoping for a franchise. Honestly, I think this series would have been better served to be adapted for TV, due to the large cast and the tone. The books have an over-the-top style that is by turns ridiculously funny and unflinchingly gritty. Kind of like a Ryan Murphy series. The movie adaptation took a tone more reminiscent of 'crime in the city' flicks from the 80's - not a bad model actually, but fans of the books will notice the feel is different. There is just not enough running time to get to know this large cast of characters very well, and even though the exposition is taken directly from the books in the voice-overs, there is still too much of it. The conversations with Mary Lou could have been cut completely, as they didn't serve even as well as the voice-overs to elucidate for non-book fans what was going on. And then the villain does that classic 'allow me to regale you with my dastardly plans' thing at a really unlikely moment. Well, that's the bad. The good is that Katherine Heigl and Jason O'Mara have excellent chemistry as Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli, and Daniel Sunjata ably fills out the black camos of Ranger. The rest of the cast is great too. I appreciate Heigl playing Stephanie as an everywoman with extraordinary chutzpah. If you haven't read the books, Stephanie is a down-on-her-luck lingerie buyer who turns to her cousin Vinnie for a job in a moment of desperation. Vinnie is a bail bondsmen, and he gives her a chance to bring in some easy FTA's for money. Only, Stephanie spots a man who done-her-wrong on the list (Morelli) and in spite of the fact that he is way too big a fish for a beginning angler to pursue, she only wants him (hence the title). While this is not as funny as the novel upon which it is based, it's still fun enough for a night in folding laundry.",1337644800,,1921,4.429378531073446

Katherine Heigl is just terrible, there is no Stephanie Plum here it is attempt by Katherine Heigl to be flirty and cute; it doesn't work.

Now that the book series has crashed and burned, it is appropropriate that the movie do the same.  So sad, such potential.",1337644800,8,459,4.3023255813953485
4359111,3,B004EPYZRG,"The film feels like it would have been better adapted as a series instead of a film. The ending especially has the impact of the end of a weekly episode and not a satisfying conclusion to a self contained comedy/romance/ adventure or whatever genre the movie was trying to be.

The movie fails to really fit into any of its genres. It's not funny enough to be called a comedy, the romance is barely there and the action and adventure are more timid than almost anything on television.

The performances however are all good. As someone who never understood the appeal of Katherine Heigl she was surprisingly enjoyable.

All in all it's not a horrible film. I would recommend against buying it, more something for a late Sunday afternoon when it comes on cable. It's enjoyable to sit through but it's not one I can ever see myself wanting to watch a second time.

Morelli and Ranger are supposed to be hunks, but I thought they fell beyond the 30th floor in this.  You can say all you want about an actor not being able to fit the role that a reader imagines about a character, but, please, please remember that there are rules and polls every casting director and director knows. There are some very good-looking, charismatic young actors who they could have hired, and who would have sold the parts much better.  First of all, Ranger is supposed to be(aye que mango!) the epitome of the tall, dark and handsome Cubano.  He's buff.  I don't think the actor in this film met any of those criteria.

The actor who played Morelli?  He almost gets it, but not quite.  Do I buy that he's an Italian-American?  Nope.

Debby Reynolds acts as though she's a Jewish grandmother, and overacts at that.

I enjoyed watching her character (Stephanie) grow and become steadily more competent (if still unsure) in her new role as a recovery agent. For those who haven't read the books, the main culprit may be a surprise because of the way things were played.

And I LOVE the grandma - yes, she's a little crazier in the books, but I love that lady, nonetheless. All in all, don't listen to the critics. They're biased, and they always say the same thing: ""formulaic romance...yada, yada, yada."" They just don't know how to enjoy some fluff and some filler here and there. I enjoyed this movie. It was cute. And the chemistry between Heigl and O'Mara was spot-on.

As a matter of fact Yedda from there would have been a better Grandma Mazur.  If there is a second movie I hope they recast the roles.

The movie was much too short. It needed at least another 30 minutes. I really cannot believe Janet Evanovich was pleased with the script and the casting. I expected so much more.

Given slight differences for reader imagination, though, the three here did a great job.  Lula is perfect--can't wait to see more of her!

The script managed to hang on to the mystery/ comedy/ romance/ action mix.  Kudos to Hollywood for not ruining a perfectly good book by ""improving"" on the story line.

I would like to have seen Stephanie's relationship with Ranger a little more established.  The spark that explains why Ranger would do all this for her was missing, making his character seem an odd fit.  He pops in and out to save her with little explanation, reason or rhyme.

The movie was my first taste of the SP books--which I immediately located and devoured at my library--and I couldn't be happier that I saw it.  For the most part, it was loyal to the plot of the first book and its characters.  Granted, Grandma Mazur might not have matched the physical description, and her movie personality was on the tame side, but this was the largest character casting flaw.  Likewise, the casting of Joe Morelli might not have been strictly accurate to his physical description in the books, but the acting was spot on and (more important) the chemistry with Stephanie Plum was real.  After reading the books, I was able to appreciate the smaller aspects of the movie I initially overlooked, such as the somewhat minor characters of Mary Lou, Eddie Gazarra, and Jimmy Alpha.  The directors and script writers enhanced Eddie Gazarra's character so that his role in the movie was significantly larger than his role in the book, but this did not detract from the focus Joe Morelli or Ranger commanded.  All were consistent with the book's portrayal of them.

Some of the main criticisms about this movie were that Katherine Heigl did not have the correct Jersey accent, the directors did not cast someone who looked physically like Joe Morelli, and Ranger appeared too chatty and not like the physical description of the character.  However, Janet Evanovich herself (a Jersey girl!) thought Katherine Heigl did a great job with the accent, so you can't argue with the creator of the series.  Second, chemistry mattered more to the directors than physical description, so would we have rather seen someone who was a carbon copy of the book Joe Morelli but without the acting abilities or the chemistry between himself and Katherine?  I think we have to trust the casting directors enough to know what they're doing.  As far as the Ranger comments, Ranger's character in the novels is very much described and interpreted by Stephanie for her reader.  That being said, some of his actions and miniscule facial gestures have to be translated into dialogue for the character to seem likeable.  As for the fact that Ranger did not have a ponytail...well, that's not a huge part of his character.  He did cut it off a few books later!

Although I loved the movie and was eager to purchase it, I must make a complaint about Amazon's delivery service and customer service.  If you preorder a movie months before it is released, it is reasonable to expect the movie to arrive at your house on the release day.  My movie wasn't even SHIPPED yesterday!  This is not the first time Amazon has been sneaky in this way.  When I attempted to cancel the DVD, multiple times, amazon claimed it could not process my request.  I will continue to buy from amazon, but if you're one of those people who wants an item as soon as it comes out, you're better off spending a few more dollars and buying it at a retail store, such as Target.",1337126400,3,3052,4.688555347091932

And who says all movies have to appeal to the young generation? They own stock in the movie theaters or something? Movies aren't being made to give kids a ""role model"" to ""want be like when I grow up."" Go see Disney movies if you want that kind of movie education. Or better yet, stick with Biographies. I haven't seen the movie but have read the entire Plum series and enjoyed them tremendously. Don't know if I want to see the movie since I know it is impossible to generate the characters true personalities and to cover all the subtle humor in such a short period. It would need to be at least 3 hours long! Also I think the actress for Plum should have been someone a little less known from a TV series. I know I will think of her as Izzy too often too enjoy her as Stephanie....but who know, she might win me over...

Who in their right mind thought Heigl was a good choice at Stephanie?  As for the rest of the cast, Jason O'Mara is a very good actor but so wrong for the part Joe Morelli. Daniel Sunjata was an OK Ranger, but really didn't inhabit the part.  The only good casting was Rex the Hamster.

My mother has read all the series and was extremely excited to see this movie when it came out.  The previews seemed funny so I took my mother to see this movie in the theaters.  I am glad I did as I really enjoyed the movie.

I am in no way the target audience for this movie but there was plenty to like about it - even an explosion.  Given the paltry excuses for movies that came out at the same time as One For The Money, I've recommend it to friends as one of the only good movie I've seen at the theatres in a long time.

4359448,4,B004EPYZRG,"If you like to read, especially modern mystery novels, then you've heard the name Janet Evanovitch. Evanovitch has made tons of money by writing the best selling series of novels based on her character Stephanie Plum, a young New Jersey girl (completely unlike those seen on JERSEY SHORE) who seeking employment becomes a bounty hunter. Now Plum has made her way to the big screen (and small screens with DVD) and done so in style.

Katherine Heigl stars as Stephanie, the hard working New Jersey girl down on her luck with bills to pay and rent owed, looking to find any job available. Visiting her parents and grandmother (one of those kooky type families we all know and love), her mother suggests she talk to her cousin, a bail bondsman. She goes to her cousin to apply for a filing job only to find it's over with but while there is told about collecting bounties on customers that have failed to show. Given a few easy jobs, she thinks she can handle it.

One big job Stephanie thinks she can handle is Joe Morelli (Jason O'Mara), an old flame of sorts from high school and now policeman on the run for murder. Most think he's innocent but the law is the law and he's on the run. With the keen insight of knowing his old hangouts and how he acts, Stephanie goes after Morelli...only to find him and then have him toss her keys into a dumpster. This job isn't as easy as she thought.

Help arrives with some training. This comes in the form of Ranger (Daniel Sunjata), a professional who knows all the ropes and friend of her cousin's who is willing to spend a little time training Stephanie. The training isn't in depth enough for her to take down public enemy number one, but it does get her enough that she can make her first collar and pick up some cash, learning as she goes.

As Stephanie pursues Morelli she discovers more about why he was arrested and what's actually going on. Morelli shot and killed a possible low life but claimed he was armed and that he was knocked unconscious afterward. Rather than wait in a cell for the outcome of his arrest, Morelli skipped bail and is trying to find the real murderer. Morelli's and Stephanie's paths continue to cross and she eventually helps him on the condition that he surrenders once they find the killer so she can collect the paycheck.

Along the way Stephanie meets a variety of characters. Lula (Sheri Shepherd) is a street walking prostitute who takes a liking to Stephanie and gives her information when she can. John Leguizamo is Jimmy Alpha, a MMA promoter with a top contender. That contender, Benito Ramirez (Gavin-Keith Umeh) is a vicious fighter with sociopath tendencies that have led him to hurt far too many on the street. Each of these characters and more continue to provide the fledgling bounty hunter with clues as to Morelli's innocence or guilt as well as the identity of the killer. Okay face it, his innocence because the chemistry between the two characters is one of the main points of the film as well as the series of books. For the series to continue he has to be innocent.

The fish out of water that learns how to swim concept is worked well with this film and Heigl does a great job. Her combination of real person attractiveness (as opposed to the Hollywood make over style) and portrayal of a person who finds their calling in a round about way makes for a character viewers will not only root for but want to see again. O'Mara has the swagger and sex appeal to make women swoon and want to see more of him as well. And Shepherd turns in a performance that will make you forget all about her time on THE VIEW.

The movie isn't one that will make most rush to the store to seek it out. I know I'll hold on to it to watch again, but can't be sure that most people will feel the same. Fans of the books will keep it around. And while the movie did decent box office when it was released, it didn't quite do enough that you'll be seeing a rush to bring the next book in the series to the screen which is unfortunate. With all the drek that is getting made, this could turn out to be a series worth keeping an eye on. Until the suits in Hollywood decide to make it happen, you'll have to be content with this offering.",1336953600,2,4209,4.416237113402062
4359449,4,B004EPYZRG,"Wow, wide range of reviews here.

I've read the first few Plum books, love the character and the spirit of the novels themselves.  I am NOT, however, a Heigl fan; even when I used to watch ""Grey's"" to me she was always a second-rate actress, plus seemed very vain and narcissistic a person in interviews.

But being a HUGE fan of Stephanie, of Jason O'Mara, and of Daniel Sunjata - I decided to give the film a shot, and was pleasantly surprised.  Heigl was quite good in capturing Stephanie Plum's character, humor, and sarcasm, and in the relationships with her parents and grandmother (Debbie Reynolds - they should have utilized her even more).  I think this was my first time seeing O'Mara in a comedic role, and thought him quite admirable - but I so do NOT get the backlash against Daniel Sunjata as Ranger; to me, with the limited role written for him in the film, I thought he was the perfect choice; masculine, in control, personable yet with a slight air of danger about him, and certainly he fit the part physically.  Again, just with they'd utilized him/the character a bit more!

The plot involves Stephanie Plum - a divorced, former lingerie buyer in Trenton, NJ - and her desperate search for a new job to pay the many, MANY past-due bills piling up in her apartment.  In total desperation, she turns to her slightly shady cousin Vinnie (Patrick Fischler, another hugely underrated actor), who runs a bail bonds office, in search of a clerical job.  Instead, as she's in need of BIG money fast, she takes on becoming a recovery agent instead - her eye on the prime assignment of finding and bringing in rogue cop Joe Morelli, now accused of gunning down a man in cold blood and who also happens to be someone Stephanie boffed once in high school ... and someone she now cannot stand, as he ditched her right after they slept together.

The rest of the film concerns her comic attempts at bringing Joe in, along with other assignments she takes along the way to pay some bills ... as Stephanie inadvertently also begins to unravel the puzzle surrounding Joe's possible innocence, even as she ticks off a whole lot of VERY dangerous men in doing so.

Not a classic, by any means, but I really liked the characters and humor, plus found the film both engaging and easily watchable (I actually got caught up in the story, even knowing what was going to happen).  Heigl and O'Mara, as well as Heigl and Sunjata, bounce well off each other on-screen, and while the film may come off as a bit of fluff it was still just plain old fun to watch.

And ANY film that can make me actually like Heigl's as an actress is worth watching alone.",1336780800,5,2644,4.529411764705882
4359450,1,B004EPYZRG,"Bad casting, bad writing, bad cinematography, bad direction. The entire atmosphere was 'flat' - no personality or humor.  I have loved the Plum series for years!

4359544,3,B004EPYZRG,"My sister and I are both huge fans of Janet Evanovich and the Stephanie Plum series so the movie proved to be somewhat disappointing. They should have followed the book much closer to do it the most justice and even though I liked Katherine Heigl as Stephanie, the men that played Morelli and Ranger were not at all as I envisioned them. However when the DVD comes out I will buy it but I hope in the future that Janet Evanovich will be a little more strict and attentive regarding the script as J.K.

4359545,3,B004EPYZRG,"One for the Money, a movie based one Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, is a medium to good movie.  At 1 1/2 hours it is too short and leaves much of the humor of the novels (which had me laughing myself off whatever chair I was sitting in) out of this movie.  It would have been better to have a longer movie with the humor in it.  Heigl does a very good Stephanie Plum, as well as O'Mara in the role of Morelli.  Sunjata lacked the charisma of Ranger, a role better suited to someone like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.  I'll look forward to any sequels, hopefully better done than ""One"".  All problems aside, it was still a diverting little movie that didn't make me consider suing someone to get the 90 minutes back.  :-)",1336089600,13,727,4.340740740740741
4359546,2,B004EPYZRG,"The movie was just okay IF (and that is a big IF) you were a fan of the book. Most of the Laugh Out Loud humor from the book was completely missing in action. Did the quirkiness of Stephanie's character not translate well or did the script writers/director have other projects that they wanted to quickly get to instead of giving this one the time and care it deserved? What a let down. After reading 18 books in the series (and others of the PLUM series) I had hoped for so much more. Casting was generally okay. Casting expectations after reading a book are never really are met - so I cannot fault anyone on that... although Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur seemed too young, too lady-like and not crazy enough. . .more like an aging unsinkable Molly Brown than Grandma Mazur. This was a disappointing adaptation of the Janet Evanovitch book. Too bad. This could have been a good franchise with multiple films in the future if this venture had been a better one. I sincerely doubt any others will be made and no one is more unhappy about that than I am. Entertaining? Generally - but it should have been the breakout comedy of the season. Considering the inane comedies that have become blockbusters, why did Hollywood drop the ball on an intelligent funny story and serve up a half baked version of the book?",1335398400,18,1312,4.540084388185654

I walked in to my newbie hood bookstore years ago and they had a display for Two For The Dough, and if you bought it, tou'd get the 1st book free!!
When I read One For The Money, I understood.
The book introduced the characters, but not so many laughs.
The fun started in the next book, and the rest is history .
Now they finally make a movie of Money.
There's good news: Katherine Heigel is a perfect Stephanie Plum. Smart, sexy, spunky! Debbie Reynolds is wonderful as Grandma Mazur, but she was underused. A trip to Stiva's Funeral Home would have been a hoot.
The Bad News: Not much else was great about the casting. I am sure that all women were wondering about casting of Ranger and Joe Morelli. In the first book, Ranger had a pony tail and was dressed in camouflage. The onscreen Ranger had short hair and was a little more sophisticated than street smart. Morelli kind of grows on you--he is kind of sexy, so I have no complaints there. The chemistry between Stepanie and Joe was great.

The movie follows the first book fairly well, but aside from introducing our characters we have now known seventeen-eighteen years, I wanted more.

If you have cable pay per view, it'd be worth the $4.99, but not the cost of the DVD.

He also took Stephanie's virginity and never called her back. In return she hit him with her car and broke his leg.

Stephanie has no experience as a bounty hunter. This fact and her doting mother (Debra Monk) and grandmother (Debbie Reynolds) supply us with some mild humor. Plum is aided by Daniel Sunjata, who looks like he could play Derek Jeter.

Punjata has definitely got the Batman thing going on.

There is so much good material, I would love to see a series that follows the books. I had the feeling that these actors were settling into their characters and need more movies or a serial to really sweep us off our feet.

I was concerned that they hired an Irishman to play Italian vice cop, Morelli- O'Mara did fine (he is a very good actor)  but he doesn't fit the ""looks like a pit boss when he wears a suit"" description, and he doesn't have a 5 o'clock shadow 5 minutes after he shaves like Morelli should.  Otherwise, I'm happy.  Heigl did great, Sunjata was smoking hot, and Shepard as Lula was plucky and perfect.  I'm a Debbie Reynolds fan but I wasn't as thrilled by her portrayal Grandma Mazur...was she playing her as a drunk instead of just a wacky, fun spirited old lady?  Hard to tell, but Grandma Mazur is a big part of the humor in the rest of the series so that needs to be sorted out a little better.  By the way, OFTM was the least funny of all the Plum books (the most suspenseful) and the movie stuck pretty close to the book.

After seeing the movie I took the dvd off my wish list.
There wasn't much urgency with the Ramirez threats either so that didn't work in the movies favor either. Overall the filmmakers were too worried about their rating and cut the film back too much. The end effect was choppy and uneven.

I would have liked to see more of Grandma Mazur. I hope that if there are future books that cast someone good for Grandma Morelli. That would be interesting. I loved where Grandma shoots the turkey and some of it goes onto Bernie, what a weasel.

I'm looking forward to buying this movie. I did feel that the book made Benito Ramirez a little for meaner in the book and not so much in the movie. I loved all the action that was in the movie. I'm sure how other feel about who Stephanie should pick....but to me Morelli i could see myself going to bed with every night. Some people might say the book was better and that is ok. For me both we fantastic.",1327795200,7,989,4.151041666666667
4359696,5,B004EPYZRG,"I'm not a film critic but I know what I like, and i liked this. I'd read One for the Money, years ago, and i got a big kick out of seeing the characters come to life. The cast--Morelli especially--were just as described in the books.

And yeah, the jersey accents were weak. That's not one of my pet peeves, though, so it didn't bug me. And Grandma Mazur could have been less grandma-like (oh, Debbie Reynolds!) and a little more nuts.

But I laughed all the way through the movie, along with most of the people in my theater. I don't know if it was because it was opening weekend, or I just lucked out, but the theater was full of fans.

I'm going to buy this as soon as it comes out on DVD.",1327795200,6,692,4.073529411764706
4359697,2,B004EPYZRG,"I wanted to love ""One for the Money"", and I should have. It had fantastic source material, a writer from one of my favorite shows (""Nurse Jackie""), and an actress from what used to be one of my favorite shows (""Grey's Anatomy""), but this film could not have been any more disastrous. There was a movie that I hated a few years ago called ""The Bounty Hunter"", with Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler. I felt like that film was as contrived as could be, and was unfunny, unromantic and incredibly unconvincing. I hate to say that ""One for the Money fell into that same ball park.

One of the reasons why I love the book, ""One for the Money"", by Janet Evanovich is because its heart, Stephanie Plum was an unapologetic badass, profane and saucy. I always pictured someone like Sandra Bullock playing the lead role, a born-and-raised Jersey girl who was down on her luck, who finds her inner badass through a series of misadventures, but ultimately comes out on top in the end.

I don't necessarily blame Katherine Heigl for ruining this movie. She did the best she could, even though her Jersey accent is laughably bad. She was simply miscast. She should have never discontinued her work on ""Grey's Anatomy, because if these are the kinds of roles she's getting, her future's only going to get worse.

Julie Ann Robinson (""The Last Song"") directed, who I blame for the movie's obviously unclear vision. You get the idea that she didn't know what she wanted this movie to be. Maybe she thought that after all of the books that had been written, fans don't remember the first chapter of the franchise. Did she and the rest of the filmmakers intend this to be a film franchise as well? You get the idea that no one really cared, given the film's messy ending and sitcom-y writing.

Liz Brixius (Nurse Jackie), Karen McCullah Lutz (Legally Blonde) and Kristen Smith (The Ugly Truth) are responsible for the travesty of a screenplay. Women ARE funny. There have been so many funny and smart movies that had primarily female writers, actors and directors, so why does this film seem misogynist? It's a mixed message, and an implication that I really don't like. Their version of Stephanie Plum is an idiot. She's not a saucy badass, like the one I loved in the books. Her profanity is turned down, too, because of the meaningless desire that the filmmakers must have had to get a PG-13 rating. Why would kids want to see this movie? Oh, of course...Katherine Heigl's inevitable ""sideboob"".

I enjoy the work of Liz Brixius, considering that she is the creator of one of my favorite shows, ""Nurse Jackie"". She has shown over the years that she knows how to properly illustrate complicated characters. She is not beyond character development, and making characters fully realized...so what went wrong here? Why didn't she scream at the other two writers, ""what the hell are you doing?!""

I can only imagine how bad true fans of the books felt about this travesty. There are eighteen Stephanie Plum novels, plus short stories, novellas and crossovers. People clearly like this character, and there have got to be a bunch of true fans out there. The first book was written in 1994, and there was talk of a movie then. It had been in development hell since then, and it's a shame to say that it probably should have stayed there.

4359698,1,B004EPYZRG,"The author of the book series is an older woman writing about a supposedly 30 year old modern day woman but the generation gap is obvious and often embarrassing.  The author has deliberately made her heroine inept, incompetent and a perpetual victim.  Plum is an insult to real life women who cannot afford the luxury of being perpetually ""cute.""  Thankfully the movie doesn't dumb Stephanie down as much as the author does but, still, the movie blows.  The film is about a woman who becomes a bounty hunter.  She is totally incompetent and succeeds by blind luck only. I like Katherine Heigle and she did breathe some humility and character into the Stephanie Plum role but the best thing about the movie was (surprisingly) Jason O'Mara as Morelli.  He took the role and chewed right through it, bringing energy and sexuality to it. But what happened with Ranger?  In fairness to Daniel Sunjata, he had larger than life shoes to fill.  When Ranger enters a room all heads are supposed to turn.  Sunjata's Ranger was just another guy with the exception he was wearing a Kevlar vest.  Sunjata has the acting chops to portray Ranger (he portrayed ""Frankie"" in the defunked FX tv series ""Rescue Me"") but for some reason he played Ranger as a talkative almost sensitive guy.  Not Ranger and not cool. I was expecting so much more from him.  The movie itself follows the first book in the series faithfully. If you are a fan of the books you will probably love this movie.  I, however, agree with all the movie critics.  This movie is a huge stankfest and a waste of money.",1327708800,7,1568,4.634057971014493
4359699,3,B004EPYZRG,"There's plenty of entertainment potential in the acting and scripting, which are remarkably faithful to Evanovich's madcap vision (I've read the first 5 Plums). But editing and post-production are lazy and inattentive, including a tensionless, barely-there musical score. Which is a shame, because everybody's strongly cast, the unjustly maligned Heigl as well -- it's a life-size characterization with a hesitant, people-pleasing nuttiness that's definitely in the books. Our afternoon audience yukked it up ... but Heigl, wearing her producer hat, should have it recut before the DVD comes out.",1327708800,6,596,5.707865168539326

That is not the case with this movie. I laughed throughout the whole movie. The few things that were changed didn't bother me at all, and some of the changes made the movie better than the book. I absolutely loved it. My friend, who is also a fan of the books, loved it as well. We both can't wait to see it again!",1327622400,5,474,4.053191489361702

8427371,2,B004EPYZRG,"How does one HATE a movie? At some point this viewer finds the time not worth my interest or experience. Still I'm not forced to watch more than I could stand, so hating this movie is far more emotion than I could bring to the film. So after 15 minutes I said NO and ejected the dvd. The cost of this film was so little that it was worth the 15 minutes but certainly not more of my time. Two things struck me: (1) the pace was so slooooooow, and (2) even the actors seemed disinterested in what they were participating.

Evanovich's books are entertaining. I can't say much more about them because after four books in the series I stopped reading any further. But still this movie was a disservice to her talent and the book. Now Sarah Paretsky had only one of her books turned into a movie and, because it made such little money, no further books were made into movies. Still that first movie was pretty good--tension, puzzle and good characters. Unfortunately ""One for the Money"" offered this viewer so little that at 15 minutes I couldn't go further.",1521331200,,1053,4.455958549222798
