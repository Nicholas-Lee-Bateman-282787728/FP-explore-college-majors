3916169,5,B000E7BR5G,"Finally the movie I wanted came in DVD format ""Dog Pound Shuffle"". this always was my favorite movie, I am surprised it has not received considerably more acclaim which it deserves. I want to thank Amazon for insuring the high quality recording of the movie, which looks better than the original shown on tv back in the 80's, this was a tv movie.
  Much appreciated.  Dan",1339891200,,371,4.590909090909091
3916170,3,B000E7BR5G,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict--  While much of Dogpound Shuffle is terribly predictable, it contains some small pleasures which allow it some measure of distinctiveness. The unlikely pairing of Moody and Soul proves a success, as the two generate some intriguing chemistry. Additionally, when it comes to putting on shows, some elaborate tap-dancing with bluesy harmonica accompaniment manages to stand out a little bit. The finest sequence in the film comes midway through, as Steps is given the opportunity to dance in front of a sizeable crowd in a lavish mansion. It's an immensely pleasurable moment that more or less justifies the occasional tedium provided by the scenes required to set it up.

Things take a turn for the maudlin in Dogpound Shuffle's final third, as Step receives some terrible news and his relationship with Pritt temporarily dissolves. This portion of the flick alternates between touching and overblown, as moving scenarios are occasionally undermined by the hammy screenplay (an extended monologue from the lady who works at the pound seems like a needless attempt at enhancing the drama of the scene). Yes, the information I've just given you may sound like a spoiler, but it really isn't. Moody does some strong work throughout, transforming a somewhat cliched character into a three-dimensional human being.

I don't know whether Dogpound Shuffle was initially shot in 1.33:1, but the cinematography certainly looks unnaturally cramped in this full-frame transfer. I'm guessing this is a pan-and-scan job, but my apologies to the folks at Scorpion if that's not the case (though if the film was shot in full-frame, I have to wonder why the cinematographer didn't pull back a bit more). Otherwise, the level of detail is actually decent, but darker scenes tend to be murky and there are quite a few scratches and flecks presents (plus some very prominent hairs in a few shots). The audio is presented in plain old mono, but it's mostly clean and clear (a few lines of dialogue are a little muffled). The only extra is an audio commentary with Jeffrey Bloom.

3916171,4,B000E7BR5G,"A quaint, cute movie about a young drifter who meets up with an old drifter and a wire haired terrier. The dog is impounded. Te pound manager cannot release the dog without a deposit, her assistant is a muscular he-man who turns out to be a sissie. The 2 drifters go about trying to raise money to get the dog back. The old drifter turns out to be a VERY talented dancer, and the young drifter is a hopeful boxer. Many delightful and poignant scenes take place in the efforts to retrieve the dog, and the boxer finds  himself. Add a surprise ending and you have one of the quintessential early Canadian color movies. I love it. If only it weren't so expensive to get a copy.",1256947200,4,674,4.307086614173229

8366982,5,B000E7BR5G,"One of my all time favorite movies.  This movie literally got lost in the shuffle at the studios when management changed.  It was originally scheduled for a big release and then when the new head of the studio came in he had no interest in it and did a limited release to get rid of it.  A real shame.  Loved both David Soul and Ron Moody.  And the dog of course.  Sweet movie of friendship and love.  But not at all syrupy.  Way back when, when I first saw it, I was so captured by the theme song (Dog Pound Shuffle) that I actually went out and bought a really good harmonica to try to teach myself the song.  Never got it, but never forgot that song.  Really glad I rediscovered the movie.",1471219200,,692,4.135338345864661

8366986,5,B000E7BR5G,"I watched and recorded on Video this film from Portuguese TV 30 odd years ago and have played the grainy copy many times since.
It is a wee gem of a film which all my family really enjoyed despite the not so good playback.
I have been searching for the DVD for many years now and cannot begin to say how delighted I am to at last enjoy this film
Ron Moody is very good especially his dancing. David Soul has excelled himself and shows what a good character actor he is. A very simple plot but great to get away from the sex,bad language and over the top violence which is the the norm of today. Not enough of the wee dog.
Not everyone's cup of tea but Dog Pound Shuffle certainly is mine.
I recommend this.",1438905600,,706,4.1231884057971016

Story about 2 drifters.  Who meet up, we don't know why they got together.  Or why Pritt David Soul with an aging tap dancer Ron Moody Steps is on the streets.  They seem to be surviving money wise.  David plays the harmonica makes some money.  His jeans are so clean and new, loves to eat big meals.  Meals was a lot cheaper than.
Ron Moody has his dog picked up and put in the pound. Ron has gone back to the pound and left a deposit for them to keep his dog until he has the rest of the money needed.  David stays with him to help.  They are seen playing music and Ron Moody doing a shoe shuffle dance, they are invited to a party and are paid with enough money to take the dog home.  When he returns to the pound only to discover that the pound assistant has given the dog to another family.
Ron and David break into the pound and find the address of the family.  Cause trouble letting all the dogs go free and fighting their way around.
They find the house and wait for the parent to come home and whistle for the dog.  You never see the children!  The dog comes flying down the stairs and out on to the road narrowly missed by the approaching car.  All is well and they return to their life of walking along the beach.
A good way to spend an afternoon looking back in time.",1436486400,,1383,4.036764705882353
8366989,5,B000E7BR5G,I enjoyed this movie.  The dancing was fun to watch.  I liked seeing David Soul play his part.  It's not quite what you're used to when watching him.  There were some laugh out loud moments.  I will definitely watch it again.,1434672000,,225,4.390243902439025
