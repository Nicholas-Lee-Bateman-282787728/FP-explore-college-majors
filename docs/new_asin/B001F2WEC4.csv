8300746,5,B001F2WEC4,"I bought these as a gift for my sister - but we're both fans of Jessica and her mystery solving ways.  Angela Lansbury did this series back in the 1980s, but it's still just as fun to watch today as it was then.  From mystery writing widow in Maine to crime solving sleuth - Jessica draws us into her life and her adventures.  There are episodes here you may want to watch again and again.  I highly recommend this collection to all mystery lovers young and old.",1391299200,,462,4.275862068965517

8300750,5,B001F2WEC4,"After recording off the air the replays of ""Murder, She Wrote"" (which I did on VHS 10 or so years ago) that had commercial breaks, this DVD collection is a wonderful revisiting to the originals stories, stripped free from all breaks.  The packaging of the disks is also very good.",1360972800,,280,4.6
8300751,5,B001F2WEC4,"I would recommend this product of Murder, She Wrote  to any one who loves mystery murders --- there is also a bit of humour in most shows ---- I ordered the complete set so it is taking a bit of time to get through --- try to watch at least 2 shows a day --- I think it may be suitable for children eleven years old and up to watch ---- am satisfied with my purchase ---  if you find ordering the complete 12 seasons at once too over whelming,  just buy one season at a time  ---  Enjoy !!!!  I do !!!!  --- Ann",1345507200,3,511,3.8095238095238093
