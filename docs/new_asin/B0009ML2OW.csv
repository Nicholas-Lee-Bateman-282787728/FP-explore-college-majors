thank you",1487808000,,48,3.9
8063243,5,B0009ML2OW,"The movie was very interesting. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, only that it sounded good. But it turned out to be very good.",1486339200,,141,4.071428571428571
8063244,3,B0009ML2OW,Okay movie nothing life altering. Just worked with what they could. Great idea but does not seem to say much.,1369612800,,109,4.5
8063245,2,B0009ML2OW,"I bought this because Teri Hatcher and my favorite Grayson McCouch were both in the movie. I prefer to watch Louis Gossett as a nice guy. The acting was rather well done, but after all, they didn't have much of a plot with which to work.  Probably a movie for the younger set, not something I would watch again.",1286236800,,311,4.271186440677966
8063246,4,B0009ML2OW,"I have just watched this film on the Sci-Fi chanel and I actually liked it. Okay it's low budget and there are no CGI effects ( a definaite bonus ) and it is so obviously a pilot for a tv series which has yet ( or never) to appear. But the acting is good to okey and the film over all is enjoyable to watch. I have never watched the Fury or Scanners but it does seem very similiar to a story I once read. It was a Babylon 5 book on the story of how the Telepath's and Bester came to be.

Also if your a big Twilight fan one of their short's also follow's a similiar idea of a small group of special people consantly on the run from the goverment who want to kill them.

However Momentum is still a good film to watch, and I intend to buy it.",1153180800,7,741,3.8366013071895426
8063247,4,B0009ML2OW,"Before Teri Hatcher got popular again in ""Desperate Housewives"", she starred in this paranormal thriller about criminals with supernatural abilities.  The story and acting are very good for this kind of cable film and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Mr. Gossett is excellent as the bad guy.  If you like movies like ""Scanners"", see this.",1133481600,6,332,4.892857142857143
