5019915,5,B006UI5ARY,"Shanachie got it right this time as this set has the episodes in chronological order. The 30 episodes, presented in their original black & white, full-frame format over four discs, look's good despite being derived from less than perfect 35mm film elements. Generally though they're a pleasure to watch and don't appear edited or time-compressed. Most have their original sponsor spots. The all-region discs feature adequate English mono audio (no subtitles or alternate audio options). As before, I dislike the packaging, with DVDs hard to remove from their plastic hubs, and with episode lists hidden behind the DVDs, meaning you'll need to remove at least two discs from the packaging to find a specific show. Now, with that said I must say I'm so excited to finally have this on DVD this season has some really good episodes like ""Toody Undercover"" (this is the episode were Toody turns out to be a better crook then cop) and ""I Hate Captain Block"" among other's. This really was good old TV.",1334707200,5,996,4.899408284023669

CAR 54, WHERE ARE YOU? ran for two seasons, Sunday 8:30 to 9 pm on NBC-TV. Filming was on location and at the pioneer BIOGRAPH studio, a Bronx fixture since 1913. The TV drama NAKED CITY was a Biograph production, as were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BUTTERFIELD-8/dp/B000LJ851Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BUTTERFIELD 8</a>&nbsp;(1960), ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW (1959) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PRETTY-BOY-FLOYD/dp/B000KJTGE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PRETTY BOY FLOYD</a>&nbsp;(1960). The shuttered studio was destroyed by a 1980 fire and renovated as an apartment complex.

.
Created by Nat Hiken (of ""Sgt. Bilko"" fame), ""Car 54"" was one of the first integrated shows on TV. Set in a fictional precinct (the 53rd), its main characters are a Mutt & Jeff team of uniformed cops. Diminutive Officer Toody is brash, pushy and a bit slow on the uptake; he has a domineering wife. Officer Muldoon is very tall, introverted and somewhat brighter than his partner; he lives with his mom.

Season Two had a female officer (Lisa Loughlin) for one episode. Another part-timer, Mickey Deems, was originally a drummer and arranger. He appeared in an off-Broadway musical with Hal Linden (""Anything Goes"") and as half of a slapstick comedy team in over 200 ""Mack & Myer"" one-reelers. Linden (aka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BARNEY-MILLER/dp/B005BUA1JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BARNEY MILLER</a>) is also here, as an asst. DA.

The street scenes when shown brings back memories as well,  The show itself got filmed in the same studio as another classic
television show of the late 1950's and early 1960's  ""Naked City,""  The studio was ""The Biograph"" where DW Griffith filmed many
of his early movies.

Hilarious situations taken to the extreme with wonderful portrayals by all the cast. Only wish there were more episodes of this great comedy classic but it only lasted two seasons. I wish there were more of the Phil Silvers show available but CBS hasn't come through with anything but the first season and a small collection of various episodes on a second DVD but half of those are already on the first season DVD.,1392854400,,578,4.621359223300971

to steal the show from Nat Hiken after all the other networks had locked
 in their schedules, preventing him from moving the popular show elsewhere,
a shows such as the Bob Cummings Show had done in the past. I think
CBS was the villain here, but it could have been NBC. Car 54 has to be
on everyones top ten list of TV comedies - it's number one or two for me.",1390003200,,431,4.011627906976744

It is so sad that HELL-LYWOOD has lost it's ability to give us decent shows or movies anymore. I for one, never watch anything on the TV except for my DVDs and I am very sure that I am not missing a thing.  At least with Car 54, the whold family can watch it without having to worry about filthy jokes or scenes.

5019986,5,B006UI5ARY,"Back in the day Car 54 could always be found once a week on patrol in my family's old black and white TV. Officers Toody and Muldoon are back, this time in proper order for their final season. This was a fun show. The humor was usually gentle, friendly, family-friendly for that matter and so made for a pleasant half-hour of family time.

What I missed those many years ago were the occasional forays into politics. This was most noticeable in the episode guest starring Molly Picon. Her role centered around a soon to be tenant of New York public's housing, then just under construction. Of the several things of historic interest in this broadcast is the fact that public housing is not described as a place of last resort but rather as permanent housing built to replace slums. There are several ironies in that last statement. If you look closely you'll see a young Ozzie Davis as a serving member of the 51st precinct. He may not have a lot of lines but he was never required to do any eye rolling black-face shuffling. Take that Lieut. Uhura.

If you only know Fred Gwynne as the makeup covered Fred Munster you may not fully appreciate his rubber faced comedic skills. In Car 54 he plays the straight man to the lead comedian Joey E.

Gunther is a goodhearted fall guy and the source of most of the laughs Al Lewis known to a later generation as the uncle in the Munsters is here - performing basically the same character - as Officer Leo Schnauzer.

5019998,5,B006UI5ARY,"CAR 54, WHERE ARE YOU?: Riddled with the same smartly crafted silliness and slapstick that characterized SGT. BILKO, (creator NAT HIKEN's previous TV smash), CAR 54, WHERE ARE YOU? followed the incredible hijinx of the funniest flatfoots since the KEYSTONE COPS. Squat, excitable chatterbox GUNTHER TOODY (JOE E. ROSS) and gangly, sensible, less talkative FRANCIS MULDOON (FRED GWYNNE, pre-HERMAN MUNSTER) were patrol partners and best buddies in this ultimate MUTT & JEFF team up. The loud, eclectic cast was rounded out by AL LEWIS (the future GRANDPA MUNSTER) as acerbic Officer LEO SCHNAUSER, and PAUL REED's hapless CAPTAIN BLOCK, two mere cogs caught up in the unorthodox procedures and general chaos that ruled NYPD's fictional 53rd precinct. The show was peppered with many familiar BILKO faces in smaller roles, not to mention a bevy of TV stars putting in hilarious guest appearances, from ALICE GHOSTLEY and WALLY COX to LARRY STORCH and CHARLES NELSON REILLY. BEATRICE PONS as TOODY's long suffering wife LUCILLE and CHARLOTTE RAE as SCHNAUSER's ditzy spouse SYLVIA proved especially memorable in recurring roles. Filmed on location in the Bronx, armed with fast-paced, preposterous plots, an unforgettable theme song (""There's a holdup in the Bronx, Brooklyn's broken out in fights..."") and a razor sharp cast, CAR 54 was ""just the ticket"" among early sixties sitcoms.

5020000,5,B006UI5ARY,"Having the opportunity to watch this very funny classic TV sitcom again is wonderful! It brings back many happy memories of watching it as a kid with my parents, who loved it, too. We would often quote lines from the show. :-) Now I watch it with my husband, who is a retired NYC police officer, so he can really relate to the humor, too. The actors are marvelous, and most of them later went on to other well-known sitcom roles.

It's every bit as funny as I remember back in the early '60s when it first came out. ""I HATE CAPTAIN BLOCK!"" is my favorite Car 54 episode, and arguably one of the funniest sitcom episodes of ANY show ever! TV today is such garbage; I feel sorry for the younger generations that will never know what true comedy is (unless they have smart parents and/or grandparents who will give them the chance to see some)! Shows like this prove that you don't have to be vulgar and obnoxious to be funny; in fact, that's not really humor, IMO. This show is an example of true writing and acting TALENT, maybe even genius. It relied on wit and cleverly constructed plots and characters, not smutty innuendo and obnoxious people. Too bad Joe E. Ross had to get a big head and cause the series to end prematurely, b/c it would have been wonderful to have a few more seasons to watch. But fortunately, in those days they made a lot of episodes, so we have many of these gems to still enjoy.

I agree that the packaging is substandard, and they could have at least included a listing/synopsis of the episodes, but I am still happy to have the chance to see this fantastic show again.",1356307200,2,1597,4.373737373737374

And despite careful attempts, in attempting to get it out of the box I only succeeded in successfully smashing Disc 3 before I had a chance to see it.

So if I want to see those 8 episodes I have to pony up additional money to buy ANOTHER set (maybe that's what the manufacturers are secretly hoping)and rip up the packaging to ensure the disc comes out.

I remember it as being a one-of-a-kind of series when it was on the air in the early sixties, and i was in high school. I've always said it was my all time favorite show, other than BULLWINKLE. Fifty years haven't changed my mind.

 It is very funny, has wonderful New York actors in basically pretty exotic characterizations. Not your typical sitcom, by any means. Very New York humor, very character based.

Not, as is os often written about it, slapstick. It is not the Keystone Kops kind of humor. It is character humor. It's just the characters are really unusual. It's not FATHER KNOWS BEST, or I LOVE LUCY, or SEINFELD. It is unique... and a half",1344729600,6,755,4.5777777777777775
5020005,5,B006UI5ARY,"This review will be for the whole series which encapsulates both box sets, Season's One and Two.

Car 54 was a little before my time; I didn't get to see it until the late '80s on Nick-at-Nite.

Personally, I was blown away that both Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis were on a program that pre-dated the Munsters.

And, just like with the Munsters, both actors shine through as comic geniuses, along with Joe E. Ross.

In fact, Al and Fred are very natural in their own skin - they really didn't change their characters once they
put on make-up for their roles in the Munsters.  The two shows blend together.

For you Munsters fans, don't forget, Grandpa said that Car 54 was his favorite show.  He said, ""that Al Lewis
really cracks me up""

I like the idea that the box sets show, ""brought to you by ..."", clips of classic products of the era.  There aren't a
lot of special features but I actually like it that way as I think the ""Special Features"" on DVD sets have gotten a little
out of hand; sometimes, the special features are longer in duration than the main material.

The packaging could be a little more conducive towards preserving the condition of the discs but this is the growing trend
in packaging these days for box sets.

Car 54 takes place in the early '60s, in the Bronx.  There are a lot of references to President Kennedy and a
lot of references to the Jewish population in the Bronx at that time, although other ethnic populations were also
highlighted in various episodes.

The show featured other typical actors/celebrities of the time, including, Nipsey Russell, Larry Storch and
Rocky Graziano.

This is a show that is simply innocent humour based on the classic formula of a small communication gone misinterpreted
that escalates in to complete mayhem and absolute confusion.  This is most obvious in my favorite episode from the Second
Season - The Biggest Day of the Year.

It stands out as one of the most funny shows in early TV history that can be appreciated by all ages and the entire family.

I highly recommend checking it out.  Try watching it along with Munsters episodes!",1339891200,6,2102,4.589812332439679

Association has begat assimilation. They try desperatly to sepererate thier actions only to reinforce the similarity. Mean while the doctor making the diagnosis despertly trys to observe them... by demanding that Capt Block submit once again to yet another routine medical checkup. The increasingly paraniod leader of the precinct's confident and cheerful demeaner crumbles as he is sure he is dieing.. For what ever reason, and many have been put forth, this show only lasted two seasons. It is a tragedy. This is a true comedy gem. Brilliantly funny, endearing characters and witty dialog. That decades later a truely dreadful film was made based on this clasic is criminal. It's like drawing a moustace on the Mona Lisa.  And one last quick side note to Shanachie for the packaging.

5020017,5,B006UI5ARY,".......you can't beat this great show. Car 54 Where Are You just HAS to be one of the best written, acted and produced comedies in sitcom history. It is terrific television, screamingly funny, and the episodes in Season Two are the carry-over from Season One. Nat Hiken was a comedic genius.

Bad news is: the packaging STILL stinks. As I received and unwrapped mine today, Disc One was loose, and the cheap cardboard packaging is not worthy of this great show. HOWEVER, Shanachie FINALLY got it right as each disc in this set contains the correct episodic order of the shows. HOORAY!!(See my other review for Season One,as I had to literally print out the order that one of the reviewers here was kind enough to list, and I have it attached to the Season One package).

Most of the reviews have covered the shows, so I won't go into detail, but, this season has lots of guest stars, i.e., Shari Lewis (remember Lamb Chop?) Sugar Ray Robinson and even Mitch Miller!!  Plus, F-Troop's loveable Corporal Agarn, Larry Storch, is great as Charlie the Drunk, and Molly Picon, a marvelous actress who guested in an episode in Season One, is back as Mrs. Bronson.  ""Hail to the Chief"", the first episode, is terrific in that, those of us who remember the Kennedy Presidency get a treat to see JFK and Jackie at the end. However, the shot was taken before he became President, just after he won the Democratic nomination and they were given a ticker-tape parade in downtown Manhattan. (Jackie was pregnant with JFK Jr. here) Terrific nostalgia, nonetheless.

I still crack up just looking at Toody's (Joe E. Ross) face. Also included in the Season Two set is a Bonus of Joe E. Ross and his stand-up comedy come back audition film. Supposedly, Car 54 retired to the police garage after just two seasons due to Ross' ego (he reportedly got so big-headed nobody wanted to work with him) and also his wanting to go back to stand up. Well, here it is. (And for this they cancelled Car 54?) Judge for yourself.

All in all, I would rather have these two season - eight disc sets to watch again and again when I really need a belly laugh. Today's shows leave a LOT to be desired, which is why, I suspect, everything old (and funny) is new again. This show was and is still, after 50 years, hysterically funny.

Enjoy.",1335312000,51,2302,4.559322033898305
5020018,5,B006UI5ARY,"After months of waiting, I am so delighted we finally received our order of Car 54, the Complete Second Season on DVD. For those of you who loathed the packaging of Season 1, prepare to buy more DVD slipcases, because these are packaged the same way...but that is the only flaw on the previous Season carried over.

While I haven't yet done an episode by episode check, this season seems to be fixed up in the chronological air date order that Season 1 didn't follow. However, the menus on the individual discs are numbered 1 through 8, etc instead of carrying the episode numbers (which isn't a big deal).

This season has featured the commercial bumps on the three episodes we checked out today and they have included Camay, Prell, Tide, and a foam hair dye (Lilt I think).

We watched Toody Undercover (featuring Bruce Gordon - Frank Nitty on The Untouchables and Ralph's bully ""Harvey"" from the Classic 39 season of the Honeymooners), The White Elephant (with the Hasty Tasty Luncheonette) and flipped through to the end of ""Hail to the Chief"" to see if Kennedy or Johnson was featured as the President.

Kennedy is the president here and is shown in close-ups with Jackie riding in a open automobile through the streets and sitting in it in a crowd...it isn't the far away shot of Johnson waving from a distance that was later played in syndication after Kennedy's assassination would have made this episode feel a bit too uncomfortable.

Also, the episodes we watched all had extended scenes or scenes previously cut to make time for additional commercials on TV in later years. We had been watching Car 54 on discs pulled from the TV and, potentially, old VHS tapes, so this was a lot of fun for us. If you had the old VHS tape releases and are merely upgrading format, this may not be a big deal, but it was major for us!

Also major is the crisp black and white and superb contrast. If you've been watching these online or on reproductions, then this is going to be a real treat as you can actually read some of the signs in the station such as the ""Rapid Mobilization"" chart.

In terms of bonus features, this is much like the previous season in that there is only one - Joe E. Ross doing stand-up (don't worry, this is supposed to be his cleaned up act post show). I haven't watched it yet but will update my review when I do.

8504540,5,B006UI5ARY,"CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU? is a black and white television series, first broadcast on television in Sept. 1961 to April 1963.  Each story is about 25 minutes long.  The show was created by Nat Hiken, and the writers include Nat Hiken, Marty Roth, Terry Ryan, and Tony Webster.  The main actors are Fred Gwynne as Muldoon, Joe E. Ross as Toody, Al Lewis as Schnauser, Beatric Pons as the domineering wife Lucille Toody, and Paul Reed as the put-upon Captain Paul Block.  The main location is police 53rd precinct in the Bronx borough in New York City.  Other set locations include the apartment of Lucille and Gunther Toody, and local neighborhood business areas with mom'n'pop businesses.  A recurring theme in many of the episodes is when Toody shows himself to be incompetent in the course of his police work, or when Toody makes some off-topic remark about his own personal life, and where Captain Block reacts with a resigned groan of near-dispair.  In other words, it is a sort of in-joke that many of the characters share, that Toody is incompetent.  A recurring nuance is Toody's almost-onomatopoeic expression, ""Ooo-ooo!"" that he makes when he gets excited or when he suddenly realizes something.

Essentially all of the episodes are clever, and essentially all will provoke laughing-out-loud.  This describes the beginning of SCHNAUSER'S LAST RIDE (Episode 34) of Season Two.  Season Two consists of episodes 31-60.  The story is fillwed with so many clever plot elements, that it was almost shocking to me.  For starters, this television episode may be unique amont all existing television episodes, in that most of it takes the form of a flashback.  But here are some details from the beginning.

Schnauser's Last Ride begins with five policeman and visitor (a man) busy schoozing and laughing in the dressing room in the police station.  The youngest policeman, who recently joined the force, begins to tell a joke: ""There were two dumb chorus girls . . .""  ""Oo--, oo--, I know this one's going to be good,"" interrupts Toody.""  The young man continues, ""and the first one turns to the other and says, SAY SALLY!""  At that moment, Schauser starts to look glum and he hangs his head, and he quietly mutters, ""Sally,"" and he leaves the dressing room.  ""He didn't mean it, he didn't know what he was saying Leo,"" says Muldoon to Leo Schnauzer who is leaving the room.  ""Why'd you have to do it,"" says one of the older policeman to the new young policeman, while grabbing the young policeman's shoulders, and scolding him.  ""WHAT DID I DO, WHAT DID I SAY,"" exclaims the young policeman, frantically.  ""YOU DON'T MENTION THE NAME OF SALLY IN FRONT OF SCHNAUZER,"" says Muldoon sternly and loudly.  ""You mean Sally was the name of his late wife?"" exclaims the young policeman.  ""Worse than that,"" says Toody quietly but gruffly.  ""His  mother?""  ""No.""  Then Muldoon opens up a page from a scrapbook showing a newspaper clipping from ten years previously.  ""This was Sally,"" explains Muldoon.""  The newspaper clipping has a photograph of Leo Schnauzer with his horse.  At that earlier time, Leo was a mounted policeman and during those years with precinct 53, he had developed an emotional attachment to Sally.  The newspaper story issued at the time precinct 53 replaced the horses with squad cars, for the policemen.  The rest of this engaging episode takes the form of a flashback, showing Captain Block's attempts to help Leo Schnauzer find a suitable partner for training on how to do his work from a squad car, instead of on horseback.  For example, Leo is first paired with Muldoon, but Muldoon is too intelligent and is not the best match as a squad car partner.  And then, Leo is paired with Toody, who proves to be more suitable, because Toody's intelligence is more like that of a horse.",1509667200,,3796,4.821981424148607
