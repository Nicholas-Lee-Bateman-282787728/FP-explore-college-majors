8577762,5,B00C6QIZ4Y,"After several re-branding attempts, they finally got it right!  The creators did a great job of blending elements of the series two (The Comet Empire) and three (The Bolar Wars) while adding a sexy-modern twist into this series. I never thought I would say or think this, but 2199 is better than the original series. These discs are expensive, but the space battle scenes and in-depth look inside the Gamilon universe will make you forget the price.  This series is a MUST buy for any true Star Blazer fanatic, er, I mean fan.",1467936000,,526,4.645161290322581

8577764,5,B00C6QIZ4Y,"The re-imagining of the Battle of the Rainbow Galaxy/Nebula is absolutely amazing -- same course of action, but different reasons for it.  Best animation of the series.  This is as good as anime gets  Get the score, too.",1444953600,,220,4.7368421052631575
8577765,5,B00C6QIZ4Y,"If you bought the US released blu-ray disks from starblazers.com, they end at vol. 4, episode 16. This picks up at episode 19. You're not missing too much and can still understand the story with two episodes lost. The Japanese release has much nicer packaging with a full color booklet and slipcover. Disk contains English subtitles.

Contains episodes 19-22. This covers the battle at the Rainbow Star Cluster, and the episodes that lead up to the arrival at Gamilas. There's quite a bit of divergence from the 1974 series here, but in a good way. The really big events are still preserved.",1438214400,2,591,4.794117647058823

8577769,5,B00C6QIZ4Y,"They have batted the ball out of the park with this new series!  If you were a fan of the original you will not be dissappointed with this!  Graphics and animation rock, soundtrack and especially the slight tweaks to the story.
Turned my kids onto this and they love it.
An absolute winner!

Battle for the Rainbow cluster is on this disk.",1389139200,,339,4.435483870967742
