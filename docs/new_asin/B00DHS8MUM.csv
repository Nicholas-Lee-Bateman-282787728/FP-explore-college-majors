5813659,5,B00DHS8MUM,"Funny, awesome, also a story. If your a fan of anime like bleach collect the seasons. It's worth every penny ^~^",1381449600,,112,4.380952380952381
5813660,5,B00DHS8MUM,"Ichigo battles to save friends and finds new friends in the most unlikeliest of places. The Series Bleach shows a the abrreviated paths of and to power that supposedly eixsts within all of us. But the lessons we learn are not always clear. Enemies, and friends can be confused, and right and wrong take all forms to include exchanging places.",1379808000,2,342,4.716666666666667
5813661,5,B00DHS8MUM,"I loved this arc, and its sad to see it end. So just to own it is a must for me... The box art is also very amazing although I believe it should have been held for the season with ichigo and ulquiorra's fight takes place above Las Noches. I wished they would have started these in blu-ray but either way, a must own of any fan of anime and bleach.",1379203200,,347,3.9014084507042255
5813662,4,B00DHS8MUM,"Bleach Volume 18 contains the last of the Zanpaktou arc, Sword Beast arc, and finally begins to get back to the main story and resume the Ichigo Vs. Ulquiorra fight. The episodes go from 256-267. 266 is a ""recap"" episode where they go back and show you eveythng that happened up to the point of the start of the Ichigo Vs. Ulquiorra fight. 267 finally starts the main story back up. Unless you already purchaced the previous box sets that have the zanpaktou arc (Box sets 16 and 17) I would pass on this box set. Although I think the Zanpaktou filler arc is the best one they have made so I would reccommend buying box sets 16, 17 and this one as I think you will enjoy watcing Soul Reapers battle their own Zanpaktou. Also some of the best fight scenes and scenarios are in the Zanpaktou arc. A small spoiler that may peak your interest, Ichigo in Hollow form Vs. Zangetsu!!",1379116800,,875,4.374233128834356
5813663,4,B00DHS8MUM,"This is basically the cleanup episodes after the Muramasa Arc. It wraps everything up for the Zanpakto. It ends with a recap with the Karakura town fight and begins the Ichigo vs. Ulquiorra battle. The cover depicts the epic ending of the latter fight. That does not happen in this set. Next one will have it. So if you hate filler and only want main story, then you can skip this. But it's still nice knowing the whole Anime story and what happens to the Zanpakto.",1378944000,,465,4.4186046511627906
5813664,3,B00DHS8MUM,"So I understand that this set will include the episodes that have to do with the sword beasts. The last episode listed on here is 267 which does take us back to the original story of the Arrancar Arc, but 267 is simply a flash back to catch everyone up. Ichigo does not kill Ulquiorra in this set, nor does he transform into his full hollow self. I simply find it weird that they chose this cover for these episodes. They don't go together. Don't get me wrong. I like the cover, but it is just very misleading.",1372204800,24,510,4.214285714285714

5813700,5,B00DHS8MUM,Like the series but not happy with the way they interrupt the main story with fillers.  The fillers are fun but it is annoying.  Much like watch a movie and you get a commercial and when it comes back its a different story.  I think frankly they do this to promote greed.  I understand it takes time to build animation which why there are season but this is just plain annoying and obviously made to pull as much money out of people.  Stretching the story with fillers after fillers. Reminds me of naroto shippuden. which is worse.,1426636800,,531,4.43298969072165

5813714,5,B00DHS8MUM,I love Bleach and it needs to be brought back! This is an awesome video set with some fantastic action scenes and story plots. Any fan needs this set.,1407888000,,150,4.206896551724138
5813715,5,B00DHS8MUM,Bleach Rocks Anime.  Can't wait for the next volume and can't wait for the next movie to come out soon.,1392422400,,103,4.15
5813716,5,B00DHS8MUM,I collector all of Bleach DVDs.  I  have seen all these on Funimation Channel but haven't viewed this DVD on my player.  I just like having them on hand to watch at a later date.  I this series is well written giving each characters their own back history and personality.  Plus  I fasinated with Japanese history and customs represented in these stories.,1391472000,,355,4.645161290322581
5813717,5,B00DHS8MUM,"So while this only has episodes 256 - 267 it is still what viz and I don't think they care what we want... this starts the ""arrancar"" arc again... For like the third time...",1387152000,,173,4.117647058823529
5813718,5,B00DHS8MUM,Great finally getting into the other story but only 2 disc instead of 3. They need to reduce the price more with only 2 disc.,1385683200,,125,4.04
5813719,1,B00DHS8MUM,"I enjoy  Bleach, however I found all the filler arches to be a waste of my time and money.  I know there are people that enjoy them however, I just don't see why they can't release these sets in groups that have filler only so they can be skipped by those that really don't care for it.

Basically I'm going to be forced to get this set to get the one episode that really matters 267.  I know there is a recap episode of the cannon arch, but if you aren't watching a 40 episode filler that really isn't necessary.",1384128000,6,513,4.1
5813720,5,B00DHS8MUM,"Bleach Volume 18 [DVD] ; Arincar Ichigo.... possibly the best set of the series, amazing effects, story, and bad guys.  I also managed to put together a Halloween costume (arincar Ichigo), horns included.",1383004800,,204,5.181818181818182
5813721,5,B00DHS8MUM,"I collect Anime & this is the next box set in the Series. All the discs were in perfect condition, no damages & I liked watching this especially the last 3 episodes.",1383004800,,165,4.1875
5813722,5,B00DHS8MUM,"This ends the Muramasa and personified zanpaktos story arc and returns to the main story. I have to assume you know what Bleach is if you are looking at volume 18, so I won't go into any more detail. I like this story arc more than some personally.",1381968000,,248,4.1875
8593365,3,B00DHS8MUM,"I only bought this for the one episode that is canon from the manga. These filler episodes really are pretty terrible compared to the canon storylines, but since I can say I've actually seen worse, I'm giving it 3 stars.

If you haven't seen bleach before definitely go back and watch it from the beginning. The first story arc is amazing.

Even though I'd seen Dragonball Z, Gundam Wing, Inuyasha, and many others, none of it grabbed me quite like Bleach. Bleach was the first time I wanted to know more so after 15 episodes I had to check out the manga, which is even better.",1520985600,,577,4.433962264150943
