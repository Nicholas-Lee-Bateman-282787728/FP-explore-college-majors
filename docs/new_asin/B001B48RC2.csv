This film begins in a television studio and shows what goes on for television reporter Kimberly Wells and her filler articles. The next newscast is from a nuclear power station. The film crew visits the turbine room. Suddenly there is a vibration and an alarm goes off. Its a routine problem but there is a complication. Then another. A sticky meter gave a false reading. There is a crisis but the power station operators are able to recover normal operation.

Back at the studio the manager decides to hold off on this story. Corporate headquarters explains why the power station cant be delayed: it costs $492,000 dollars a day! The cameraman is quite excited and agitated because his film will stay in the vault. He blames other people for his problems. The investigation clears the station operators at the plant. So why would anyone worry? Do reporters have a bias against nuclear power? Who owns the press? Back at the power station an investigator finds stray radiation at a pump. They are concerned. We see filming at the hearings. Jack Godell investigates the engineering records and finds discrepancies. Jacks request for a retest is rejected; it would cost too much. Jack visits D.B. Royce and has his fears confirmed.

Jack is warned: the big construction company has their own security force. Jack offers to give copies of the radiograms to Kimberly, who wants to do this story. The courier with the films has an accident on the road. Will Jack show up at the hearing? A car chase adds action and pads out the story. In the power station Jack takes direct action against the other personnel. This threat is real! The chairman of the board McCormack arrives to handle the problem personally. There will be a delay until Godell can be interviewed. What can happen now? Will countermeasures be used? There is an interesting philosophical discussion about human error. Is there absolute safety? What about aging or natural disasters? [Is this drama really a scientific horror film?] The problem with the lone gunman is resolved. But the interview by Kimberly Wells puts a new spin on the events.

There is always a trade-off in engineering. If America uses its abundant coal there is either more pollution or higher costs of electricity. Oil means exporting dollars. Natural gas is limited, as is water, solar or wind power. Since nuclear power is newer most people fear this offspring from atomic bombs. The competitors of nuclear power inflame these fears. This film was made about 30 years after the start of the atomic age. Another 30 years has gone by. The New England states and New Jersey get half their electricity from nuclear power. So do Japan and France. What about your state? Was this story inspired by the Karen Lockwood case?",1444867200,,2781,4.848421052631579
