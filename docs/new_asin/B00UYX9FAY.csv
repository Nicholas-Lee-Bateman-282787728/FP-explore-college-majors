7071947,4,B00UYX9FAY,"Mutants is a good horror film but I did expect more.  The film is well directed and the set designs, art direction, make up and special effects are all top-notch.  It deals with the mutation of one of the main characters and moves rather slowly.  The film's pace picks up in the second half.  For some reason I did expect more and felt that the film could have benefited from the use of more characters and their plight against the mutants that are running amok.",1298246400,2,462,4.4
7071948,4,B00UYX9FAY,"Two survivors struggle to outlast a deadly mutant plague that has turned most of the world into bloodthirsty killers. Unfortunately for Sonia, her husband Marco has also become infected, and she must sit back and watch as he slowly succumbs to the disease within their isolated refuge. MUTANTS kicks off to a ferocious start before taking a more timely approach with its two main characters. It quickly transcends the average zombie shocker due to its emotional depth and its compelling themes surrounding terminal illness, grief, and loss. David Morlet builds a gripping suspense as the audience awaits Marco's final descent into madness, watching intently for the moment when his mind will snap into a feral rage. Not soon after he finally does, Sonia is apprehended by a group of militant scavengers, who take over their stronghold and prevent Sonia from administering the treatment that has slowed the effects of the disease on her husband. Their arrival alerts all of the infected within earshot, and the inevitable bloodbath ensues. From here, MUTANTS becomes a more familiar monster, pitting the last of the living against the infected and themselves. With plenty of gory effects, the film has just as much to offer the flesh fiends as it does intellectual Horror fans.

7071949,3,B00UYX9FAY,"Earlier French films were relegated to the art house category but, as of late, it seems I'm seeing more and more going for the American market. This is particularly true of the horror genre. With films like ""High Voltage"", ""Them"" and ""Martyrs"" they are making stronger inroads to a younger, hipper audience.

""Mutants"" explores the undead(ish) genre of movies. It's not quite an undead movie because, even though this plague is brought on by a virus, these creatures are quicker and craftier than the Romero era zombies. This movie tries to explore what happens on a day to day, person to person level of trying to survive. It's not a far putt from the ""Walking Dead"" series on AMC Network.

Here you have two ambulance medics/ partners/lovers who are trying to find sanctuary in a military base code-named NOAH. They're in the mountain regions of France, running out of fuel, when they come upon a huge, remote installation. The boyfriend is infected so the girlfriend needs to see if she can stop or slow the infection long enough to get rescued. Things don't go too well. A rough group of survivalist types shows up with no intention of helping anyone but themselves. The mutants converge on the place and all bets are off.

This is a noble effort that just doesn't quite come together. The acting is good, the production values are decent (save for the near constant, shaky, digitized camera work) and there is good use of location. But the sequence of events forms an odd rhythm and the hot points come at weird times and don't often enough have the emotional impact they should given the story line. I was also a bit put off by the mutants themselves. It's not difficult to understand the undead as an increasingly rotting, festering, ashen looking lot. But this virus transforms people into a type of creature that didn't allow me to suspend my disbelief. And believing is crucial when dealing with this or nearly any other horror genre.

This isn't a bad movie by any means. You could see that all involved were sincere in their efforts to explore some of the more subtle aspects of the genre. But unless you're a die hard fan of this sort of thing you might want to give it a pass.",1291593600,,2190,4.63659793814433

7071951,3,B00UYX9FAY,"Note the photo on the cover - about the last 15-20 minutes of the film, you get to see some of that and then-- the film is pretty active.  The film up to that point is s-l-o-w and much akin to a one man or 2 man stage act.  We follow the man and woman around the place while he slowly (very) becomes infected and much angst and weariness ensues.  Well acted (very, in fact) but just slower than I expected and not punctuated with any spikes in the storyline untill the end - then it lights up big time!  So an okay film, but you'll need lots of patience to get to the stuff you likely rented or bought the movie for -- for sure, rent 1st.",1290384000,5,638,3.9609375

7071953,5,B00UYX9FAY,"I wonder if Author Richard Matheson knew when he penned his classic novel 'I AM LEGEND' all those years ago that he would be responsible for the horror film hybrids of the Living Dead Zombie and the viral infected Zombie.  The novel spawned three film incarnations 'THE LAST MAN ON EARTH', 'THE OMEGA MAN' and 'I AM LEGEND' and also was the theme of George Romero's 'NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD' and his Living Dead ethos and caused filmmakers to branch out into different directions such as the Pandemic genre of which Danny Boyle's '28 DAYS AND 28 WEEKS LATER' was the genesis having our loved ones turning into manic mutations .  Now comes 'MUTANTS' from France, a tense study of true love being tested to its endurance.  Director David Morley put us into a situation seen from the point of view of a couple one of which was bitten and is slowly turning into a feral flesh eater.  Most of the films running time has the viewer going through the grueling transformation of the boy friend as he fights from making a dinner of his girlfriend who believes they will be saved by the Army which has the antidote to the virus.  Can she keep him from turning till the cavalry arrives?  Make up effects and cinematography is top notch and the film never stops exhuding dread and tension throughout its running time. The film is in the French language with English subtitles so if you are up for a gory, tense experience, click the add to cart button.  The new breed of Zombie seems to have arrived and with the success of AMC's new series 'THE WALKING DEAD',  our living dead and infected loved ones will be rambling and snarling across our screens with no end in sight.",1289520000,2,1661,4.513333333333334

7071960,4,B00UYX9FAY,"I'm always hungry for a bargain but recent low-price purchases of horror DVDs have left me with little but a sense of a loss of time and money. With this in my mind, I didn't expect much when I picked up Mutants, a French post-apocalyptic horror from writer and director David Morlet.

Given that I only paid 2 for this, the fact that the cover looks like a rip-off of The Crazies artwork and the synopsis sounds a bit generic, I was NOT expecting great things from Mutants.
Half-heartedly settling down to watch this, my attention was immediately grabbed by the film as it kicks off with no pre-amble whatsoever. The violence is brutal and gory; and this is a theme that continues throughout the film.
Although this is a blood-soaked offering, it would be unfair to categorise Mutants as simply action-horror. After the opening stanza, this develops very much into a character-driven suspenseful horror and focuses on the plight of Sonia and Marco as outlined in the synopsis and their struggle to cope with Marco's deteriorating condition.

Shot mainly out of the studio in a bleak winter setting and utilising some kind of creepy abandoned hospital, Mutants enhances the sense of isolation experienced by the main characters as they come to terms with their situation and fight for survival.
The special effects cannot be criticised and the make up for the creatures is certainly above the standard you might come to expect from many zombie/ infected sub-genre. The production values on this project have either been high or wisely spent.
The final chapter of the film sees the return to the pace of the start and the brutal violence and action of the opening sequence and is all done very well.
Mutants has been criticised as a 28 Days/Weeks Later and other recent genre movies rip-off. I'd say this is entirely unfair. The ""infection"" may be similar to that seen in Boyle's film, the incubation period for the virus is far longer in Mutants, offering those infected a much more agonising drawn out process before full infection. Although the mutants of this film reminded me of the creatures seen in The Descent, I was of the opinion that the story was refreshingly original considering how many post-apocalyptic/ zombie/ infected films exist in the genre and have a tendency to focus on big set pieces, chase sequences and special effects to the detriment of character development.

This may be a bit slow-paced in parts for many fans of the sub-genre but give this film a chance and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",1355443200,,2531,4.8271889400921655
7071961,5,B00UYX9FAY,"This movie starts out great and ends just as well, kept me interested the entire time, wonderful acting and effects are top notch.

7071962,5,B00UYX9FAY,Beautifully shot. Acting is impecable. Husband turning into a mutant/zombie gives an amazing performance. ER doc character is excellent. The characters didn't do a lot of stupid things. They made reasonably smart decisions throughout the film. Would put this just behind Dead Snow and Shawn of the Dead. Equivalent to Stake Land. Maybe a little better than The Horde. And I really liked all of these movies. Love French horror. They have no rules!,1354060800,,447,5.054054054054054

7071964,5,B00UYX9FAY,"First off, be advised this is a foreign film. It's in French with English subtitles.

This is one of my favorites. I have watched it many times and thoroughly enjoy it every time.

Special effects and cinematography are well done in this film. Pretty basic without all the Hollywood CGI, but very good and believable. The acting was fine and I think the characters were presented and developed well.

The story is partly about the woman and her partner struggling to survive and partly about their love for each other. Even after he is infected and starts to mutate, she stays with him and tries to cope, hoping to find a way to help him. If you want a good drama with a zombie/mutant back story, you will likely enjoy this. If you want blood, gore, explosions, fighting, etcetera, you will want to pass.",1332633600,,804,4.569444444444445

7071966,3,B00UYX9FAY,"<strong>Mutants</strong> (David Morlet, 2009)

Interesting, if somewhat predictable, French zombie thriller with a fun twist: Marco and Sonia (Francis Renaud from <em>36th Precinct</em> and H&eacute;l&egrave;ne de Fougerolles from <em>The Beach</em>) are ambulance attendants at the end of the world. They don't know it's the end of the world, natch, but they quickly find out when a dead cop taking a ride in the back of their bus reanimates and takes a bite out of his partner. Cue the whole ""the dead are rising, but we're going to resist such an illogical explanation"" bit, till Marco gets himself bit. The rest of the story, which comprises the bulk of the film, deals with Marco's degeneration into zombiehood while Sonia frantically tries to find a cure for the disease while the two of them hole up in the remote hospital out of which they were based, back when there was anyone alive to take care of. As Sonia's attempts get increasingly desperate, she finds herself forced to make alliances with a number of scavengers, thieves, and worse...

It's not a bad little film, though the end goes way overboard with what seemed like minor silliness in the first two-thirds of the movie. You've seen half a dozen worse zombie films in the past year (especially if you like direct-to-DVD horror as much as I do), it brings the gore, and it's surprisingly well-shot (by Nicolas Massart, who did <em>High Lane</em> the same year); worth a look if you've exhausted your other easily-accessible zombie options. ** ",1327449600,,1512,4.968379446640316
7071967,5,B00UYX9FAY,"I knew the French were on to something good in the Horror genre after watching the excellent High Tension served up by Alexandre Aja. I have been a horror buff for more years than I care to remember,and especially fond of the zombie/undead/mutant post apocalyptic gems that have cropped up over the years. This film has a bit more in common with 28 Days/Weeks Later than any of the more traditional zombie fare,but the air of paranoia and claustrophobic chill does tend to remind one of Dawn of the Dead. It is a tale of two survivors,faced with an impossible situation in a world gone awry. The character development is great and the acting was superb,especially in the moments between the two lovers amidst knowing one of them faces certain doom whilst the other refuses to let go of her uncompromising sense of faith that everything will be ok when help arrives. The special effects and gore sequences were very realistic and much better than I had originally expected, and the action was doled out smartly and never over the top. This is perhaps a thinking mans zombie flick,as it offers a little more by way of plot to titillate the gray matter than just solely relying on blood and guts. It was pretty cool to view something that satisfied my hunger for good blood effects,while giving me good dialogue and visceral acting,not to mention lines that didn't seem to be filler or pedestrian. I'm not usually a fan of sub-titled flicks in any genre,but that was a minor concern given the overall quality of the film. Highly recommended for horror and sci-fi fans not just looking to be force fed gore for the sake of gore and inane,wooden acting. Check it out!",1326931200,,1662,4.675767918088737

7071969,4,B00UYX9FAY,"Another Movie recently watched on Netflix in HD. This time French with English subtitles and a pretty good zombie type movie. I won't give away the whole plot but here are some general thoughts...
Much of the theme is about seeing a loved one turn into something unrecognizable.
Stars Sonia (Helene de Fougerolles) who was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beach/dp/B00003CWM3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beach</a>&nbsp;(at least that's where I recognized her from) and Marcus (Francis Renaud).
Although technically these aren't the undead, but the infected. It still has that ""zombie-like"" feel to it. They're infected, they bite you, you become infected...
Good makeup work for the monsters. Everything looked good in HD, although being filmed in Winter in Europe, everything has kind of a gray and moody tone to it. Even blood was very dark colored and realistic looking.
The acting is top notch..just in French. Far better than B movie grade.

* Die Hard zombie fans will enjoy this as a rental.
  Others not really into the genre will probably want to avoid.",1310601600,3,1114,5.579881656804734
7071970,3,B00UYX9FAY,"My rating is actually 2 and a half stars, but am rounding up as a courtesy to the professionals involved in making this film. The French have been churning out some top-notch horror this past decade,so I was really looking forward to their take on the ""zombie"" film (zombie-like would be more accurate). I'm an old school horror die-hard that refuses to give up on the genre &, again, love the fresh vitality the French have brought to it these past several years. And my verdict? Its....Ok.

Professionally shot and edited,the acting was very good,as was the music. A competently made film, for sure! But the story was neither distinctive nor very original. As the tension and action doesnt really pick up until the latter third of the films running time, I can't really recommend for it's purely visceral horror impact,either. The intended psychological build-up I found somewhat...Bland.

My advice would be to just rent it. It wasn't exactly boring,but again I didn't find anything particularly engaging,distinctive or memorable about it either. Not sure when, if ever, I will watch it again.",1307750400,,1096,5.016483516483516

8708761,3,B00UYX9FAY,"The ad copy on back of the DVD compares this movie with Cronenberg's remake of The Fly. However, these two films could not be more different.

Cronenberg showed how the love between Seth and Ronnie grew as Seth's body disintegrated. As usual in a Cronenberg movie, body triumphs over soul and mind, but the defeat in The Fly was neither meaningless nor ignominious. For once, the Canadian expressionist injected a little bit of humanity into his material, so much so that you remember the romance far more fondly than you remember the typically repellent and excessive gore.

And therein lies the rub with Mutants. If ever a zombie movie were devoid of humanity, this one would have to be it. Director/writer David Morley puts you right in the action from the start and never lets up. The fast pace and slam-bang editing are used to camouflage a trite and hackneyed plot. Homage to other zombie flicks is one thing, but a tepid and lazy ripoff is another thing entirely. The only reason this movie  can get away with so much lack of exposition and lack of character development is that most audiences can fill in the details because they've already seen a gazillion knockoffs just like it.

Mutants does have its strengths. Morley's expression of absurdity and nihilism does at times approach a comic view of life. At the beginning, a young girl escapes a horde of zombies only to be run down by a speeding ambulance. Her blood and guts splatter all over the windshield and dash and it IS funny in a ghastly way. At the end, Helene de Fougerolles is trapped in a pen with a zombie. After she kills the zombie, other mutants outside the pen can't get in. What began as a trap turns into a panic room. So the movie does have its little philosophical niceties, not to mention zombies with four nostrils instead of two. Imagine that!

But the bottom line is, the movie is too derivative and too workmanlike.",1445385600,,1903,4.635014836795253
