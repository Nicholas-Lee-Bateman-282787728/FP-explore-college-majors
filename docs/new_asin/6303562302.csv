694443,5,6303562302,"Do you remember the character in ""Reefer Madness"" who demands the piano player to ""Play faster....Yeah, faster! Faster! Play it FASTER!!""? Well, he's the star of this over-the-top Columbia serial. Dave O'Brien IS ""Captain Midnight""! Holy smokes! He delivers dialogue at a machine-gun pace and doesn't hesitate to take on half a dozen bad guys at a time. He has two totally lame-brained ""assistants"" who seem to exist solely for comic relief, the skull-faced Guy Wilkerson as mechanic ""Icky"" Mudd and 27-year-old Sam Edwards as his.....ward? Oh, never mind. They face off against the evil ""Ivan Shark"", who occasionally dons silky bloomers and a scarf on his face to intimidate his captives. (He should really have been featured as one of the ""Lightning Bug""'s disguises in ""J-Men Forever"" - guess they didn't check out Columbia serials.) Why, ""he even interferes with OFFICIAL BUSINESS!"", barks our intrepid narrator. Shark's battle cry is ""Fools! Idiots!!"", since his henchmen aren't the sharpest tools around. As usual with Columbia and Horne, the plot is all over the place. Shark starts off by bombing (as in a squadron of bombers!) some factories, but even though this is 1942, he doesn't seem to have any ties to the Germans or Japanese. He loses interest in that and focuses his attention on obtaining a new ""range finder"", going to all sorts of trouble, includng kidnapping, torture, and other assorted nastiness. It's never really clear what his ultimate goal is, but there's plenty of action, including at least one huge fistfight per episode, plus the astonishing aerobatics of the various ""aircraft"" used by Midnight and Shark. Midnight is the alter-ego of Captain Albright, who reports to 71-year-old Joe Girard as ""Major Steel"", but again, what the whole point is remains....obscure. Picture and sound quality are very good - surprisingly good, considering the source material. Great fun all around - never takes itself as seriously as the Republic serials and is all the better for that. The ""death traps"" get increasingly outrageous and reach what must be an all-time pinnacle with the wild setup at the end of Chapter 10. Highly recommended for first-time serial viewers, and veterans will savor the outrageous cliffhangers.",1232582400,2,2241,5.15934065934066
694444,4,6303562302,"Dave O'Brien is hilariously over-the-top as the Captain, in one of the goofiest serials you'll ever see, and I've seen quite a few.  Anyone who's interested in buying one of these movies knows by now that they all have pretty huge script problems - funny how those problems eluded us when we were little kids thrilling to these adventures on the big screen.  I won't give away many of the details - suffice it to say not much of the story makes sense on a logical level.  But the action!  Lots of fights, endless car chases (dig Captain Midnight being arrested by Motorcycle cops) and of course, 15 death traps.
  My favorite moment comes in chapter 12 or 13. After escaping a dozen death traps,  Midnight has been knocked to the ground.  Henchman #2 is about to shoot him.  The Evil Boss yells at the henchman ""No, don't shoot him.  I want to finish him MY way.""  You just want to shout at the guy ""But your way never works!""
  The Evil Boss is a master of disguise - check out how he's able to make himself look EXACTLY like the chief of police, a medical doctor, even Captain Midnight himself - and this was before CGI.
  And finally, there is Dave O'Brien. He never speaks his lines or enters a room - he shouts and runs! And runs! And shouts!  It's truly the runningist, shoutiningest performance of 1943.",1208217600,3,1310,4.418410041841004

694446,4,6303562302,This is a ridiculous serial (What do you expect? James W. Horne is the director!) but it's a lot of fun. I particularly enjoyed the short fused master villain Ivan Shark and his inept henchmen. Dave O'Brien is fine as the Captain and the supporting cast is fine. The print quality is not quite as good as it is on some of the other VCI DVD serials but it's more than adequate. 15 chapters on 2 discs with some bonus serial trailers. Highly recommended for serial fans!,1122595200,12,468,4.390804597701149
694447,3,6303562302,"CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT is a) a Columbia serial, and b) directed by James W. Horne. That's two strikes on it right there, according to some serial purists who don't care for Columbia's illogical, six-against-one fight scenes and Horne's exaggerated, tongue-in-cheek approach. But this writer likes both Horne and Columbia, and this 15-chapter cliffhanger is about par for both.

Dave O'Brien, hero of Monogram East Side Kids melodramas, PRC Westerns, and M-G-M Pete Smith comedies, has to be the most authoritative serial hero on DVD.  As Midnight he speaks very quickly! and urgently! and you MOVE when he tells you! O'Brien should have done more of these serials; he does his own stunts, too. James Craven, magnificent in Columbia serials as an easily exasperated villain, plays a master of disguise here. The script has too many ""great impersonations"" where Character A poses as Character B (you don't buy these at all because it's obviously the same actor twice) but at least it keeps the story interesting.

The cliffhangers are standard perils except for Chapter 10, which has a doozie: Craven traps Midnight in a sealed room, then he makes the floor revolve rapidly, then he removes the walls, THEN he sets the floor on fire, and THEN he lowers a stone block on his victim! This jaw-dropping overkill looks like James Horne at work, and must have sent Saturday-matinee audiences into ecstasies.

The supporting cast is adequate. Sam Edwards is good as Midnight's teenaged pal, Joseph Girard is wooden as O'Brien's superior officer, and ingenue Dorothy Short screams too much (but since she was Mrs. Dave O'Brien, we can understand the casting).

Fun for serial fans, but not as enjoyably satirical as the Columbia/Horne ""The Green Archer"" and ""Terry and the Pirates."" Print quality is excellent throughout.",1107734400,24,1806,5.1084745762711865
694448,4,6303562302,"Dave O'Brien leaps into battle against evildoers as the famous radio adventurer Captain Midnight. Midnight seeks to protect a scientist and his daughter from invention-stealing bad guys out to wreck America's defense effort. The bad guys, lead by Ivan Shark and his daughter Fury, stoop to new lows as they battle the Captain and plot to destroy our war effort.
O'Brien fills the role of Midnight well, despite looking and sounding a bit like a young Richard Anderson (Oscar Goldman from ""The Six Million Dollar Man"").
Dorothy Short as the scientist's daughter, Joyce Edwards, is mostly suitable as a sort of love interest for Midnight, but mostly useless in every other capacity. She brings the helpless-girl-who-gets-in-trouble-in-almost-every-chapter to heights never dreamed of by Noel Neill, who played Lois Lane in the classic Superman TV series. Short's continual screaming and helpless antics drag the serial down a bit. Far better (and a better choice for the Joyce character!), is the evil daughter of Ivan Shark, Fury, played by Luana Walters.
Joseph W. Girard plays the gruff but concerned Major Steele, who lets Cap walk all over him (apparently, in Midnight's army, being a ""mystery man"" means a captain outranks his commanding officer). Guy Wilkerson and Sam Edwards lend a hand as Captain Midnight's pals, who, like Captain Midnight and all the crooks, share the strange inabillity to retain their firearms when they get their foes cornered.
Ivan Shark, played by James Craven, is a great villain. He is a master of disguise, and has a fabulous secret lair. Several things fail Craven however, as his personal ""Arab"" outfit to hide his features is discarded about half-way through the story. Also dropped is the gang members going by numbers and not names. Worst of all, Shark's purpose and motivation for trying to wreck America's defense plants is never very clearly explained. As he sneers his evil way through confrontations with Midnight, all the while operating his dubious death traps, there never seems to be any connection with the Germans or Japanese, an element that would have added to the believability of Shark as an anti-American fifth-columnist villian.
One gets the sense that this serial (released in early 1942) had originally been more about a gang of rogue, criminal aviators who are after the scientist's new bombsight to serve their own ends. That would make sense, seeing as how the oft mentioned but never seen defense plant attacks were probably incorporated into the story post-Pearl Harbor.
The serial is pretty good overall, with moderately suspenseful cliffhangers and some good tricks, secret hideouts, and fights. It's probably two or three chapter too long, though, and things can get a bit tedious after a while. Probably Columbia's best effort, but it's no Republic serial, for sure.",1085702400,38,2834,5.163043478260869
694449,3,6303562302,"Serial purists will roll over in their graves or fall off their
sofas after viewing this one. James Craven is back again ranting
and raving against his underlings and wearing many ridiculous disguises. One hilarious scene has him arguing with his daughter
over the sillyass disguises he dons--of which she strongly disapproves. In another scene his numbskull thugs knock each other out. Keep your tongue firmly in your cheek and you will have a lot of fun watching this one.",1068076800,2,474,4.9375
694450,3,6303562302,"As one who was a loyal Ovaltine drinker (hated the stuff, but I had to be the first kid in my block to get the mugs and decoders!) and CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT fan during the 40's, I was hoping for a better depiction of my childhood radio hero.  Yet, sad to say, I can't honestly justify giving this more than three stars.
Indeed, there is a lot here that is enjoyable, and I give credit for that.  First, the reasons for a three star rating are mainly a less than faithful portrayal of the main character (Why is he wearing a mask when everyone knows who he is?), the omission of the character's origin and the beginning of the conflict between him and Ivan Shark, and (with the notable exception of chapter 10) basically weak chapter endings and next-week resolutions.  Heck, our hero just walks away, albeit rather dazed, from a number of the situations!
However, especially on a repeat reviewing, James Craven as the evil Ivan Shark shines as a villain.  His facial and bodily over reactions are a joy to watch, along with his vitriolic tongue lashings of his henchmen.  Unexpected dialog, such as his peevish ""I don't want to talk about it!"" in one aerial scene is well delivered.
And then, there's James W. Horne's direction.  Horne directed several classic comedians including the Three Stooges, Laurel & Hardy, and Buster Keaton, and he used this style to pepper the serials he directed such as THE GREEN ARCHER (which also featured James Craven as the bad guy), THE SHADOW, and this one.  Scenes such as three of the thugs ending up slugging each other after the hero gets away with their vehicle and one henchman crossing his fingers while the other radios very unwelcome news  to Shark  are examples. There was one scene that regrettably was edited out though it was shown in the teaser at the end of one chapter that again was prime Horne, with Craven venting his wrath on all in his reach.  And the resolution to the very spectacular chapter ending in Chapter 10 is masterful in a comic sort of way.  Another Horne touch is the slight hint made that there could be more to the father/daughter relationship between Ivan and Fury Shark than meets the eye, especially when contrasted to the more acceptable relationship between heroine Joyce and her inventor father.  Finally, there's the radio serial like narration at the start and end of each chapter.  The chapter end narration is standard for Columbia, but the hyperbolic chapter introduction is very reminiscent of the golden days of radio.  I do wonder about Joyce's obvious flubbing of her lines when she's on the phone in the first chapter...was that poor editing, or did Horne think that it might be cute to let it stand?
Yes, I would dearly love to see what Republic could've done with the character.  But we do have the Columbia version, and despite its several shortcomings, many (certainly not all) serial fans will enjoy this.",1013126400,8,2893,4.700990099009901
694451,3,6303562302,"One of the most popular of the old-time radio programs was Captain Midnight, which ran from 1938 through 1949.  Columbia Pictures created a cliff-hanger serial loosely based on this program, though with differences common to serials of the era.  The radio featured Captain Midnight as the leader of a paramilitary aviation-based organization called the Secret Squadron.  He had regular companions Chuck Ramsay, Joyce Ryan, and Ichabod Mudd.  In the serial, ""Captain Midnight"" was a secret identity, like a comic-book superhero, rather than a code name, as in the radio show.  The film dropped many of the radio-show trappings, leaving just a few items, such as Captain Albright (Captain Midnight's real name) as a skilled aviator.  The serial is typical of many of the period, with a relatively thin plot, but lots of action.  For a serial, it's not bad, and it doesn't ""cheat"" (i.e., change the cliff-hanger bridge) though there is one rather remarkable survival of a peril.  It's entertaining, though those wanting to find out about the radio show will find little in the serial to enlighten them.",996364800,9,1099,5.100558659217877

I have about 100 cliffhanger serials in my collection and rank this one among the best and certainly the best Columbia Serial that I have seen!

7851959,4,6303562302,"Radio's ""Captain Midnight"" was adapted as a 15-chapter serial movie by Columbia in 1942, directed by James W. Horne.

Ivan Shark (James Craven) whose squadron of bombers has been attacking war industries, has his men try to steal a new rangefinder developed by inventor John Edwards (Bryant Washburn).  Edwards' daughter Joyce (Dorothy Short) calls for help from former World War ace Captain Albright (Dave O'Brien), whose secret identity as Captain Midnight is known only to Major Steel (Joseph W. Girard) of Military Intelligence.  Shark's men get the plans for the rangefinder, but find they are in code, and Joyce had sent the working model to Albright's Nevada headquarters, allowing for many chapters of attempts to get the device.

This was the next to last serial directed by James W. Horne, and those familiar with his other serials will find no surprises here.  I find it more entertaining than ""The Green Archer"" since there are fewer plot complications and better consistency in the comic abilities and styles used by the actors, with James Craven and Dave O'Brien especially well-matched.  In keeping with Columbia's low budget, Captain Midnight's headquarters is a small shack in the Nevada desert with a landing strip, and while the ""Secret Squadron"" gets mentioned once, Midnight's only assistants are his ward, Chuck Ramsey (Sam Edwards) and scientific genius Ichabod Mudd (Guy Wilkerson).  Major Steel's immediate resources seem equally limited.  The plot provides many opportunities for certain-death cliffhangers such as airplane crashes and explosions from which Midnight walks away with nary a scratch, plus two special death traps cooked up by Ivan Shark, doubtless inspired by Rube Goldberg and operated from the same control panel despite being in different hideouts.  Also helping control the budget is use of the same studio ""automobile"" regardless of who is driving, often a poor match for the cars used in the chase scenes.  But James Craven as Ivan Shark is in top form, and his many disguises include perfect impersonations, done with a little makeup and some body padding.  He is aided by his daughter Fury (Luana Walters) and a gang of less-efficient underlings including Jack Ingram, Chuck Hamilton, Ray Teal, Edward Peil, Sr., Ted Mapes and Al Ferguson.

VCI's DVD edition, # 8376 is on two discs, and as with many of their older releases it is now DVD-R, the first being double-layer which won't work on many players, causing problems from ""no disc"" messages to lock ups requiring the machine to be unplugged, so it's a good idea to check the instruction manual for ""DVD+R DL"" and ""DVD-R DL"" in the list of compatible disc types.  Available prints of Columbia's serials are often not very good; the one used by VCI has occasional instability in the vertical dimension.  The contrast is a little high, but sharpness and gray scale are both quite decent.  In some chapters the sound has periodic fading and a little distortion, though the dialogue remains clear.  A minor issue with the ""restoration"" is that VCI freezes the image during the opening titles and chapter introductions, eliminating the dimensional wrinkles, image wobble, ""dirt"" and related defects, and while a fairly good simulation of the original film, it doesn't look quite right, causes a little flicker in some titles and makes the print defects more obvious once the chapters start.  ""Extra"" features include ""Bios"" of Dave O'Brien, Dorothy Short and director James W. Horne; a ""Photo Gallery"" with two original ads and seven still images from the film; and four Columbia serial trailers, interesting if not in especially good condition, for ""The Green Archer,"" ""The Vigilante,"" ""The Iron Claw"" and ""The Secret Code.""  The second disc has the ""VCI Serial/Cliffhanger Promo,"" with clips from several trailers, used to advertise VCI's releases.

VCI's old VHS transfer, # 1752 wasn't a whole lot worse, though duplication quality of individual tapes may vary.  On my copy, dubbed at SP speed, the highlights tend to burn out a little more than they do on the DVD, but the image is nearly as sharp, and they didn't freeze the credits and intro text to the chapters; all the dirt and scratches are in their natural state, though a couple video glitches are present that appear to have been in VCI's master, which were edited out of the DVD.  The sound is similar, less-filtered in some chapters but with the same fading and distortion issues heard in the DVD.

This is an entertaining serial, if neither a strong plot nor a faithful representation of the radio program is expected, and as with most serials it is best when watched with a day or more between the chapters.  VCI's DVD has the added trailers, and if the transfer is only slightly better than the VHS edition, the improved control of the highlights makes it preferable for those having DVD players compatible with double-layer ""burned"" media.",1380931200,2,4907,5.03831891223733
