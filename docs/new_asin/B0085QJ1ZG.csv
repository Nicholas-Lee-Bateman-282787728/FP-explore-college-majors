5562172,4,B0085QJ1ZG,"I loved this movie. It really made me concentrate and try to find clues throughout. One of those movies where at the end you think ""oh THAT'S why she did that"". The acting is terrific, especially the mother. The best compliment I can think of is that days later I was still thinking of this movie. Can't wait to see it again and catch all I misssed the first time around.",1345507200,,371,4.23943661971831
5562173,5,B0085QJ1ZG,"This clever thriller plays with perception and linear plotting.  When a mentally impaired young man sexually assaults his caretaker, we watch events unfold from the perspective of the young man, his mother, and the caretaker - and each leg of the story plays out in a different sequence.  We get to know the three players in a way that conventional storytelling wouldn't allow, and the results give character and dignity to all three.  It's clever and meticulous, and even when it's difficult to watch, it doesn't veer into exploitation.  Top it off with fantastic performances all around, and you have an innovative and satisfying viewing experiene.",1345507200,2,650,5.10377358490566
5562174,4,B0085QJ1ZG,"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said by better reviewers than me?  Truly a one of a kind thriller written and directed by a soon to be master of the genre.  This movie is the one that people will be pointing back to when talking about the movie that started it all.  Great performances, amazing photography, and most importantly an amazing script directed perfectly.  Buy it, rent it, do anything you can to watch it.  Original independent cinema at its best.",1345507200,,484,4.5813953488372094
5562175,5,B0085QJ1ZG,initiative and mind blowing Zack Parker's Scalene is fresh and intelligent filmmaking at its finest. Margo Martindale shines in this thrilling 3 sided tale.,1345507200,3,156,5.541666666666667
5562176,5,B0085QJ1ZG,I watched this movie a couple of times since it is the type of movie that leaves you at the end with a lot of questions. I still don't know who the bad guy is. Who killed who? As usual Margo Martindale's performance was brilliant,1345507200,,229,4.111111111111111

5562179,4,B0085QJ1ZG,"What a wonderful film! It's intense, thought provoking, and the actors truly go balls to the walls. Rape, murder, abuse and  drug abuse are just some of the topics this film deals with, and well I might add.  A must see.",1345507200,,220,4.341463414634147

5562182,5,B0085QJ1ZG,Scalaene is a fantastic movie- it is very intense but it really makes you think. The changing points of view keep you on your ties and make you pay attention. It's thought provoking- showing how one situation can be seen three different ways. Great film work and great acting!,1345507200,,276,4.653061224489796
5562183,4,B0085QJ1ZG,"One of Zack Parker's biggest film influences is Stanley Kubrick and it shows in SCALENE. The film is about perspective and the director uses every corner of the frame to create unique perspectives for each character, and at times one is reminded of Kubricks ""moving pictures"" (as I like to call them) where nothing on screen is merely what one sees. Margo Martindale lends pathos to a seemingly unsympathetic character while Hannah Hall adds deep shadows to a character most actors wouldn't have given more than two dimensions. Adam Scarimbola does a superb job acting with very limited dialogue. The film was shot on a microbudget with a very talented, local crew (most from Indiana) and is evidence of this young director's growth since his previous film QUENCH. If you're tired of the same weekend box office premieres and would like to entertain your brain then I recommend this film.",1345507200,,888,4.926666666666667
5562184,5,B0085QJ1ZG,"There's a great moment towards the end -- that I won't spoil here of course -- where you realize what's going to happen only right before it does, it's one of those perfect little moments that are the best parts of (good) movies and this one has earned that distinction.",1345507200,,270,4.42
5562185,5,B0085QJ1ZG,Loved this movie! It kept me thinking the whole time! Love how it started and ended.  Movies that keep me guessing are the best an this movie Kept me interested the whole time. Total shocker!,1345507200,9,191,4.457142857142857
8563609,5,B0085QJ1ZG,"When dealing with smaller budget projects I usually enter with a lot of hesitance and much was the same with Zack Parker's Scalene. But 30 minutes into this diverse film I knew that I was doing it a disservice to label something like this as simply ""low budget fare"". It clearly is a step above it's competitors. With an intriguing look at an unspeakable crime we get multiple versions of a story that keeps you guessing until the very end. The pacing is very tight, the tension builds at just the right levels all leading to a powerful conclusion.

There is much praise and rightfully so for Margo Martindale but don't let her amazing performance take away what was also a harrowing effort from Indie darling Hanna Hall who lets her angst and fear power through the screen. It is easy to see that there is talent here from top to bottom which has me excited for more work from the entire cast and crew, namely Director Zack Parker who has shown quickly that he is a Director on the rise.",1345680000,,988,4.458563535911602
8563610,5,B0085QJ1ZG,"Amazing performances from Margo Martindale, Hanah Hall, and Adam Scarimbolo (whose performance I also loved in ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints""). ""Scalene"" show three different perspectives of the same story, involving the assault and rape of a college student (Hall) by the mentally challenged young man she looks after (Scarimbolo). Soon, the young man's mother (Martindale) comes looking for revenge.

With a shocking climax and scenes of great drama and intensity throughout, ""Scalene"" will leave a lasting impression in your psyche.",1345680000,,541,5.597560975609756
8563611,5,B0085QJ1ZG,"this is a must see movie,another great one from the director z.parker keeps you at the edge of your sit very suspenseful,and a must for your collection",1345593600,,151,4.62962962962963

8563617,4,B0085QJ1ZG,Well named - three very unequal and disturbing legs to this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Martindale was fantastic. I will be watching this movie several times till I get it all figured out.,1345507200,,194,4.676470588235294
8563618,4,B0085QJ1ZG,"I popped this in with low expectations, and idly followed what seemed to be a well-acted, but fairly predictable story.  Then I was left sitting there with my mouth open.  I love it when a movie surprises me, and this one did.",1345507200,,226,4.357142857142857
