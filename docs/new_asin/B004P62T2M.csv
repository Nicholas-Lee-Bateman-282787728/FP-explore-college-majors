Paulie Zink presents the basics of yin yoga in this easy and fun DVD.  I have had the pleasure of being able to study with Master Zink in person and love this DVD.  His warm and engaging manner will keep you watching this one over and over.  I do.

As a yoga teacher I teach yin yoga to my students and highly recommend this DVD to my students and to anyone wishing to improve their flexibility and range of motion.  My students who are serious triathletes love the balance that a yin practice gives to their hard workouts and competitions as well as those students who may have a sore back from gardening or just moving around day to day and those wishing to improve their golf game.  I have students from ages 5 to 84 who practice the things Paulie Zink has taught me.

No matter what your age or fitness level. what sport you play or style of yoga you like, you will benefit from even the smallest amount of practice as taught by the person who founded yin yoga.  If you are curious, look deeper into Master Zink's background as a martial artist and international champion.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monkey-Kung-Fu/dp/0865680612/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monkey Kung-Fu</a>&nbsp;As a teenager he had average flexibility, so see for yourself what a consistent practice and hard work can develop.  And you will be surprised at what just a couple of short practices a week will do in a very short period of time for your own body, sense of well being and flexibility. Why just sit wonder, try doing it yourself and find out. Do look at Paulie Zink's websites ([...] and [...] )to see some short clips from this DVD and his others.",1340064000,9,1803,4.787096774193548
4443974,5,B004P62T2M,"Finally, a Yin Yoga DVD made by the creator of the art! Master Zink has taken the seemingly endless Yin Yoga postures and distilled them into a simple and successful transference of the basics. This video shows how Yin Yoga can easily and efficiently transform movement from posture to posture without any wasted energy.  You learn step by step how to cultivate and harness energy to use for you health and well-being. There's a particular emphasis on simplicity and fun in this video that conveys a user friendly approach.  Don't be fooled however. As effortless as Master Zink shows Yin Yoga to be, once you immerse yourself into practice with the DVD, you'll see how readily you can progress at your own pace. Anyone who's willing to practice and grow can benefit from this work. Master Zink's presentation is both patient and practical. His instruction is compassionate and straightforward. A highlight of this DVD is its playful and lighthearted delivery. It offers basic techniques that provide a foundation to authentically achieve more flow and grace in one's practical movements in daily life.  In this video Master Zink discusses the balance of Yin and Yang, dark and light. He successfully demonstrates this balance naturally in his movements, words and presentation. Thanks Master Zink - keep flowing!",1306454400,12,1313,5.097674418604651

8437523,4,B004P62T2M,"So when I pictured Yin Yoga, I didn't imagine that the founder would be him.  But if you want to learn Yin, he will teach it to you.  It is by far the visually least pleasing DVD I own.  He looks like he just left his cubical at his office job and shot this DVD.  No music, no students.  But he explains the poses, what you should be feeling and why.  It is not my favorite DVD but as Yin is not offered at my studio, I find it an essential addition to my library.",1467417600,3,464,3.831578947368421
8437524,3,B004P62T2M,"I bought this DVD months ago and have used it once. There is NO music! If there was music, I would be using it, as he's very friendly and easy-to-understand for a newbie like myself.",1461715200,,182,4.228571428571429

8437527,1,B004P62T2M,One of the worse videos I ever purchased.  This was a waste of my money.  Although Paulie Zink is known as the master of Yin Yoga the video does not show this.,1398124800,,159,3.9375
8437528,5,B004P62T2M,"I learned about Paulie Zink and yin yoga from a yoga instructor who attended one of his workshops a few years ago in the Pittsburgh area. When I learned that he lived to Montana near my hometown of Billings, I was especially hooked. Last time Ihad been in Montana, yoga was not widely available and for a master to move there really intriqued me. He has some wonderful cow pictures on his website. I think he must have a great sense of humor. The dvd is low key, informal, but very complete and easy to understand and follow. It is informational and non-pretentious and absent of any slick commercialization. I found it really refreshing and non-intimidating.",1369353600,8,659,4.689655172413793
8437529,5,B004P62T2M,"I have taken workshops with both Paul Grilley and Sara Powers, well know Yin Yoga Masters and Instructors. Grilley studied under Paulie Zink and Powers studied under Grilley and helped evolve Yin Yoga by publishing DVDs and books, and holding Yin Yoga workshops. I have a home practice that is a unique combinations of years of various exercise, yoga, and meditation training, workshops, study, and video instructions, but I have never had the opportunity to attend one of Paulie Zink's workshops. So when I found out about Paulie Zink's new DVD, I was thrilled!

Paulie's instruction is very intriguing to me in that he also integrates a lot of Yang/movement into his Yin practice. The movements are in between the Yin postures (gentle yoga posture held in a passive way)  and focus on how you're moving and transitioning. The postures are combination of traditional (like forward bends), some with unique twists, and some postures I have never seen before (with names associated with animals & elements). Very cool! All the postures are done on the mat sitting (no standing).

 Paulie also holds the postures less time than Grilley's and Power's DVD practice routines, so a very interesting variation if you're tried a Yin practice before. In combination with his movement/transitions, it's a new way to get in touch with your body and introspection. He also repeats some of the postures so you can feel the change as you do practice on one side of your body and the other. I feel a lot of Qi energy flow after this practice. (Note: Techniques for stretching of this type have been practiced for centuries in China and Taiwan as part of Daoist Yoga).

This DVD is a fair price considering you get two unique sessions. One is 1/2 hour and the other is one full hour. They are not spliced together repeated posture segments like a lot of people are producing. Each is individually continuous footage. In the 1 hour session, Paulie shows a Bear move that lots of fun and gave me a good chuckle!

The DVD has an excellent menu interface to choose either of the practices, any of the posture segments within those 1/2 and 1 hour practices, along with an ""extras"" section.

Paulie instructs without students and describes the postures throughout the practice. He provides the advanced position of the postures, but also alternatives for beginners and people with limited flexibility. Even though this is called Yin Yoga Basic, I believe every level of yoga practitioner will benefit from Paulie's instruction (please read my caution* paragraph below though). Paulie comes across as a very down to earth, knowledgable, sincere person with very clearly understood verbal and visual instruction.

Here's the lineup of practices. All postures are performed on the floor without any props. All you need is soft carpet, pad, or blanket for Paulie's practices.
The 1/2 hour session consists of 6 sections: beginning, holding postures, half genie, hip opener, pigeon, and the tide. The 1 hour session consists of 12 sections: beginning, metal triangle, sitting frog, cross legged frog, catapillar, cow, stump, horse, bird, frog, sitting tree, and holding postures. In addition, there is an ""extras"" section on the DVD: breath & flow and relaxing into postures where a student at the camera asks a question, then Paulie answers the question and talks about that topic. and credits.

*One word of caution with this practice. Paulie is very, very flexible and that is reflected in his demonstrations during the instruction. Please be careful though; do not try and mimic him too much on some of the postures. Make sure to listen to your body and don't feel like you have to push it. Yin Yoga is a somewhat passive practice and like Paulie says you ""grow into the posture"" as you hold the poses and as you practice regularly. Try to listen to your own body (feel yourself in the pose) and go to your own limits (not maximum), not Paulie's :-) I learned this myself on one of his movements in the hour practice. There is a forward bend with a side roll. I rolled on to my shoulder the wrong way and heard a loud sound in my shoulder. I pulled the connective tissue. I iced it right away and it's healed up now. I wasn't paying attention to my body and instead just following his instruction. Please use care, especially on this movement in the 1 hour session

I continue to learn and evolve in my own home yoga and meditation practice and Paule's new DVD is a whole new perspective on practice that is helping me with new and unique postures and movement not available on the other DVD's.
