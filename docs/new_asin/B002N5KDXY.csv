The world of Opera is in turmoil. Battle lines have been drawn between the ""post-romantic"" and the ""historically informed"" performance practices. Attendance is at stake. Budgets are at risk. But the lines are bizarrely fluid, with the establishment opera houses staging baroque operas and the thriving intimate houses staging Carmen and Wozzeck. The strife is most critical between the orchestra pits, between upstart ""original"" instrument ensembles and previously secure ""modern"" symphonic forces. Okay, there are regions of security behind the lines; nobody is performing Rameau with 20th C instruments and nobody is doing Wagner with an ""authentic"" 19th C orchestra. However, the stage designers and stage directors are waging a different battle, uncorrelated with their baton-wielders. Virtually all stagings of Wagner these days are non-traditional modernist oddities, and so are those of Rameau and Lully. The casts of singers are often equally inconsistent in vocal technique, with Placido Domingo and David Daniels singing on the same stage. Does that sound like a wonderful truce, win-win for both sides, or a musical imitation of the DMZ between North and South Korea?

You can hear the divergence of vocal techniques in the singing of the three women characters of this Vienna production: Donna Anna sung by Adrianne Pieczonka, Donna Elvira sung by Anna Antonacci, and Zerlina sung by Angelika Kirchschlager. Pieczonka sings a different technical 'vocabulary'from the other two. Except for Carlos Alvarez s Don Giovanni, the singing in this recording is quite splendid but not quite coherent. That word ""ensemble""? It means togetherness; to my ears, the more ""ensemble"" a cast of singers achieves, the better the music. Alvarez, by the way, does not have a beautiful voice or an iota of sprezzatura, but he compensates in stage presence. His acting is exceptionally cogent. His Giovanni is despicably plausible.

That's the core of this production, that Don Giovanni is an odious, unredeemable villain, an egotist whose social privilege and wealth make him doubly hateful and triply destructive. If this 'dramma' is supposed to be giocoso, nobody mentioned that fact to Stage Director Roberto de Simone. There's less comedy in this staging than in any ""traditional"" Don Giovanni I've ever watched/heard. Even Leoporello seems more tragic than comic. In short, this is a drama of high seriousness, an impassioned protest against the abuses of the Ancien Regime, as bold a condemnation of aristocracy as the dramas of Beaumarchais. Giovanni is NOT a compelling rake here; he's an insufferable swine. His vaunted courage is simple narcissism and he gets exactly what he deserves. In the near future after the opera's debut in 1787, so did the Ancien Regime; this is a staging of Don Giovanni that heralds the French Revolution in its indignation.

I like productions of Mozart that make sense dramatically. Most don't. Witness the utter ridiculousness of nearly all the ""Mozart 22"" productions on DVD from Salzburg. I give this production high marks for intelligent dramaturgy. Alas, that quality of intelligence is almost undermined by the silly, distracting, annoying costume nonsense. Characters change not only their clothes but their demeanor and their historical evocation between scenes. And there you have the skirmish between Traditional and Modernist once more! The Traditional costuming/scenery was opulent, and this staging is opulent indeed. The Modernist costuming/staging is all Theater of the Absurd, and this staging is absurd. I ask the same question as before: Is this supposed to be ""win-win"" or is it just some costly version of cognitive dissonance?

Last and least, there's the orchestra. Perhaps I should stop writing forthwith, lest I offend traditionalists, but here I go: Riccardo Muti conducts the Vienna State Opera Orchestra with all the sauciness of yesterday's leftover spaghetti. I'm not asserting that only 18th C instruments can play Mozart's music effectively, though they usually do. But even 20th C instrumentalists, at this point in the campaign, have to display some sense of the distinctive performance practices of 18th C music. Orchestrally, Muti and company come as close to making Mozart boring as any pit band ever could. By the way, I admire Muti's work with verismo operas; he should stick to his own game.",1344297600,3,4587,5.330110497237569
8374581,5,B002N5KDXY,"This is a very fine production and wonderful performance of 'Don Giovanni' back in 1999.
Riccardo Muti has conducted a number of Da Ponte's Mozart operas in Vienna, and this, together with the 1996 'Cosi fan tutte', are musical winners through and through.
The reason is simple - the casts in both productions are GREAT.
In this 'Don Giovanni', for once, we have a Spanish 'Don'. Carlos Alvarez - who is both a fine actor and good baritone, though most of the time, he got 'muffled' in costumes and wigs that are not really becoming the Don. Visually he could have fared much much better had a more sensible art director been around.
He handled the vocal parts with aplomb, though the 'Serenade' could have been a bit more sweet and alluring. But generally speaking, he has the vocal prowess to depict a roguish Don, and the looks to convince that this Don is a real charmer and seducer.
As the 'counterpart' to the Don, D'Arcangelo is a funny and lithe Leporello, so rarely found in terms of comic capacity. HIS costumes are surprising effective, and he makes good use of his capabilities in this important role. The Catalogue Aria is a real winner.
The ladies are all very good, with the vocal crown to Adrianne Pieczonka, whose Donna Anna blows the listeners away through and through, though visually more stolid. Anna Caterina Antonacci is very convincing as Donna Elvira. While her earlier entrance isn't that 'fiery' as the role demands, in the latter two Acts she is able to conjure up all the sympathy for this role.
While the soubrette role of Zerlina is being sung by Austrian mezzo Angelika Kirchschalger instead, hers is both a vocal and acting winner. The Massetto is Lorenzo Regazzo, who has since built up a major baritone career. And even the Commendatore is none other than Selig!
This production offers wonderful chance to see ALL these big operatic names in their youthful state, and with Muti at the pit, nothing can go wrong!",1296345600,,1946,4.726470588235294

It is precisely the same product, but it has a different picture on the cover of the DVD box and thus might be confusing.

The following is my original review from 2005.]

There is no doubt who the stars are in this Vienna State Opera production of 'Don Giovanni': the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (aka the Vienna Philharmonic) under Riccardo Muti. I have rarely heard such subtle, flexible orchestral support in what is, after all, generally considered a singer's opera, but one that has innumerable orchestral felicities. And they accompany a cast of singers who, while not all that well-known internationally at the time of this performance (1999), are performing at quite a high level. This live performance (not in the Opera House but in the more intimate Theater an der Wien) was recorded for Austrian television and directed for that medium by the ubiquitous (because he's so good) Brian Large. The stage production by Roberto de Simone is mostly traditional, although one peculiarity is that the costuming (by Zaira de Vincentiis) is updated era by era as we go through the various scenes of the opera -- Giovanni starts out in Act I, Scene I dressed in 16th century commedia dell'arte garb and by Act II he is dressed in a kind of 19th century costume, having along the way been dressed in 17th and 18th century wig and tights, etc. This is mildly puzzling but not intrusive, nor does it add much to the production. The sets are mostly utilitarian, albeit beautiful, and do not distort the action as is so often the case in recent European productions.

As I said, though, this is a singer's opera and here we have much to happy about. The young, lithe Carlos &Aacute;'lvarez (a Spaniard who had gone to medical school and become a gynecologist before switching his career to singing) makes a marvelous Giovanni, both in his singing and his acting. He comes across as very charming and one can see how he could win over Donna Elvira even after she has denounced him. The Elvira is Anna Caterina Antonacci. She is a beautiful woman and has a striking voice. She sounds thrilling, as in 'Mi tradi' in Act II. Donna Anna is sung by a young Canadian soprano, Adrianne Pieczonka, and she is simply marvelous. Her 'Or sai chi l'onore' is a bit covered, but I was won over by her overall performance. (As I write this, her moving 'Non mi dir' is replaying in my mind's ear. Lovely.)

Leporello is taken with complete gusto by the handsome Ildebrando d'Arcangelo. His servant is winning, cunning and hunky. And he can sing, too. His 'Catalog Aria' is a charmer. One surprise for me was the silken Don Ottavio of tenor Michael Schade. I had only heard him once before and thought he was a rather typical tenorino, but in this production he produced a sweet, full voice that did full justice to his 'Dalla sua pace' and 'Il mio tesoro.' And his acting was effective. Slightly less so was the Masetto of Lorenzo Regazzo. His voice was a little rough around the edges and his acting a bit stereotypical. It didn't help, probably, that he was mostly in scenes with the gorgeous and gorgeous-voiced mezzo Angelika Kirchschlager, who has since become an operatic superstar. Her 'Batti, batti' was delicious and her acting charmingly effective. The Commmendatore was the appropriately cavernous-voiced basso, Franz-Josef Selig.

You will have noticed that many of the principals are Latins -- &Aacute;lvarez, Antonacci, d'Arcangelo, Regazzo -- and that, coupled with Muti at the helm, conspired, I believe, to make the opera more Italianate than it often is. Muti conducts on three different DVD releases of 'Don Giovanni,' one of which, from La Scala, I've also reviewed here. They're all good. But this one is also particularly good-looking, at least partly because of the young attractive cast. I recommend this DVD with only minor reservations as noted above.
