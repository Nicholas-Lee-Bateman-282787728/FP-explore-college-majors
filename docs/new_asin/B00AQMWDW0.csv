8556480,3,B00AQMWDW0,"Being a little generous with my rating as these two German made B-films are mediocre  but they do possess a certain curiosity  to them. The first on this double feature ""Curse of the Yellow Snake"" is over long and over boring.  Don't know what the original Edgar Wallace material was like but this story doesn't hold up and appears awfully dated. Acting is okay but direction is plodding to say the least with ""action"" scenes downright laughable and the attempt at touches of comedy with an obviously gay antique dealer more embarrassing than entertaining.
Oddly the second film  ""The Phantom of Soho"" is much superior and I don't know why this doesn't get top billing in this release. The story passes and it has a certain style and  despite the obvious basement budget and unevenness, it does try at least to be interesting and mysterious. There's been an effort to create some nifty camera angles and the depiction of Soho nightclubs is more than adequate. Helped by a much better story, acting and direction is certainly on a higher level than the other film.
On the plus side, both films are presented in their original widescreen format (in glorious black and white!) and have been well dubbed with convincing English voices replacing the original German dialect.
Nice to  have the opportunity to see these obscure films from the early 60's but be warned, don't expect too much from this double bill of potboilers.",1409616000,7,1420,4.823045267489712
