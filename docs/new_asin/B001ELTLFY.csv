8298757,5,B001ELTLFY,"Super little informational guide... If you know nothing about cutting hair, this is really informative & very easy to follow along.  I highly recommend this!",1481500800,2,157,5.28
8298758,5,B001ELTLFY,"This is a really great dvd to have when you want to learn to cut hair or you need that extra hair cutting that you didn't learn already. I got this for my daughter who is wanting to go into salon work. She is trying to learn as many different cutting, styling, and other beauty styling ways. I got her this dvd to see if it was possible that she didn't know these ways, which lucky for me she hadn't learned yet. She found that they were very informative and descriptive to what she needed to do to get the desired results. The different techniques that were shown were so very easy to copy and gave her ideas as what she should do or not do. I am so glad that I was able to get this for her. The seller is really nice also since I did have an issue at first getting this dvd. The prices are not bad either.

I did get a discount on this for my honest non bias opinion. This is a good dvd to learn different hair cutting ideas. It also gives you step by step which can be very helpful to some.",1473206400,2,993,3.965
8298759,5,B001ELTLFY,"Another great hair clipping DVD full of easy-to-follow instructions for hair stylists and barbers to broaden their knowledge and skills when it comes to different hair clipping techniques. My colleagues love it, it's a valuable addition to our staff training tools in the salon and makes it a lot easier for stylists to learn and visualise the different techniques before performing them on our clients. I love how it covers both the traditional cuts as well as the more funky avant grade cuts as we get quite a broad range of clients from young to old that come through everyday.",1415491200,4,580,4.81
