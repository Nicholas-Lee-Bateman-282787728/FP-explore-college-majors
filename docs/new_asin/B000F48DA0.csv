8362412,5,B000F48DA0,"Joe Egender and Buffy Charlet starring.

A very lighthearted and funny look at a young man stressing out as he approaches his 30th birthday because he has done little with his life so far, a problem that many people seem to face today. Sometimes the movie may appear a little juvenile, but at the next turn Lurking In Suburbia will have you laughing and grinning from ear to ear. Five stars for touching on the subject many millennials face and the humor that it brings with it's message! Of special note are the performances of the cast and Catherine Frazier in particular who plays a ponytailed over-sexed cheerleader which you might remember your wonder years being like.",1510790400,,674,4.760683760683761
8362413,2,B000F48DA0,"See the cover?  What does it remind you of?  Me?  National Lampoon style movie.  This ain't it.  This is an independent film.  Yes, there is nudity, but not the Playmate variety.  Yes, there is drinking & drugs & wanton sex.  This is not however one of those slick productions we've all grown to love.  This is a poorly lit & acted movie.  The lead character will stop & randomly talk to the camera while everyone else he was just speaking to ignores this, ala Ferris Bueller without the charming scamp.  These are normal, everyday people who got together to make a movie about a guy on his 30th birthday taking stock of his life, his friends, family & generally how he's living & finding himself wanting more all the while discovering it was right before his eyes the whole time.  Not fairy tale style tho.  In the deleted / extended scenes, he tells the camera that at parties such as his, it's best to carry around an empty beer bottle so he has a legitimate excuse to leave the conversation cause he needs a fresh one.  I say skip this.  Seriously, don't bother unless you need more angst in your life.",1359504000,,1106,4.432835820895522
