8428053,5,B004FN26U0,"Ultimate Cat is a fast-paced action--information documentary showing lions, tigers, and leopards strongly attacking prey animals and vigorously feeding interspersed with meaningful scenes that describe the big cats' characteristics.  Caught in a foot snare, a roaring leopard powerfully swings around a gathered pile of tree branches in attempting to break free, showing its strength and quickness.  A big cat's jaws are lined with thirty teeth, and the carnassial teeth in the back of the jaws slide past each other in up-and-down movements for scissoring cutting.  A tiger is taken to a hospital for medical imaging analysis; two large arteries flow to the powerful jaw muscles, while two smaller arteries connect to the small brain.  The largest cats' jaws close down with more than 900 pounds of force.  Lion and tiger attacks on human beings are described and dramatized.  A big cat's throat bite is a controlled moderate action that stops circulation to the brain and causes unconsciousness in the prey animal.  Lions' and tigers' skulls are almost identical.  A 900-pound male liger, the hybrid of a male lion and a female tiger, is featured next to a 500-pound male Bengal tiger; a liger lacks growth-inhibiting hormone.",1307750400,3,1228,5.229591836734694
8428054,2,B004FN26U0,"I expect much more than this from National Geographic, which has been providing informative and well constructed media for us since 1888. This presentation is fairly useless, repetitive and drawn out, with points lost in rambled cycles of poorly scripted dribble better suited for a first-year university student's first weekend natural sciences project. I am actually just sitting here confused as to how this was ever approved for release.",1292198400,,441,5.405797101449275
