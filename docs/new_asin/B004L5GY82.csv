4400289,3,B004L5GY82,"I found the overall quality of this dvd set to be good with the exception of a few episodes where the quality of the video and sound were not very good. But this represents only a small portion of the toal episodes. John Smith and Robert Fuller were great in this series and worked well together. Young Robert Crawford Jr. was very good as well as the great song writer and composer, Hoagie Carmichael. There are some pretty good fight scenes through out the many episodes. I enjoyed watching this first season set and am glad to have it.",1303603200,7,538,4.444444444444445
4400290,4,B004L5GY82,"i bought a lot of the older western tv series,such as gunsmoke,and rawhide in split seasons and payed more than i wanted to,here you have laramie the entire season 1,good but not great western. who new robert fuller could act after watching him in the tv show emergeny.john smith is great and so is the rest of the cast and good stories with great guest stars.its no gunsmoke but very intertaining",1303430400,4,397,4.605633802816901
4400291,5,B004L5GY82,"In 1959, two 'ranch' westerns both made their debut on NBC, one series titled ""Bonanza' about a widower and his three sons, and this one titled ""Laramie"" about two brothers, a family friend, and a drifter who wandered onto their property, but he ulitmately stayed, so this is my review of ""Laramie"".
  It is a mighty great series that your whole family can enjoy. John Smith, Robert Fuller, Hoagy Carmichael, and Robert Crawford, Jr. all excel in their roles as 'three and a half men' on the range in the Wyoming Territory, as they encounter all kinds of oultlaws, indians, Army deserters, crazed ex-confederates, a couple of preachers(one woman, one man), and all other assorted types of folks. It was a good thing that Smith and Fuller swapped roles before filming ever began, because it could never be as successful if Fuller had played Slim Sherman and Smith as Jess Harper. Yes, Slim and Jess were quite a pair, sort of like Tod Stiles and Buz Murdock in the modern day early 60s on Route 66, which preimered the next season.
  Picture and sound quality of the episodes are pretty good, with the exception of ""Glory Road' and ""The General Must Die"" which obviously came from some show collectors VHS tape(s), so hats off to TMG and NBC Universal for a great efort in releasing this collection. Season two should be due by sometime this coming summer, and maybe they could retool the color seasons 3-4 for improved qualtiy. Happy trails, buckaroos!",1303344000,39,1452,4.75
4400292,5,B004L5GY82,"I have the last ""color"" season and this is great news to have the first season, especially as it has the great Hoagy Carmichael. And that's Bobby Crawford, Johnny's brother, also. Both came out of the Walt Disney ""Mickey Mouse Club"" era.
Now, how about ""Lawman""???? Not to mention the concluding seasons of ""The Big Valley"" C'mon, guys!!!!

4400293,5,B004L5GY82,"Obtained ""Laramie - The Complete First Season"" recently and reviewed all the 31 episodes in black and white.  Timeless Media Group did an excellent job transferring these episodes from Universal's film to DVD.  Originally, these films were suppose to be destroyed by a fire at Universal Studios but last year Universal found that they were not destroyed.  There are two episodes, ""Glory Road"" and ""The General Must Die"" that were not found.  The film copies of these two episodes are fair and do not meet the clarity and quality of the other 29 episodes.  But if you are a ""Laramie"" fan, you are thankful to Timeless Media Group and Universal Studios finally releasing this great television series on DVD.  Now, the question is, when will one of the cable stations show this great Western!  Encore Westerns has finally released ""Wagon Train"" Season One and Two.  Maybe they will show ""Laramie"" one of these days.  Thanks, anyway, to Timeless Media Group for releasing this great season.  Now, when is ""Laramie - Season II"" going to be released.

The plots are often interesting and twisty.  Hoagy Carmichael is a real treat and the young Robert Fuller provides plenty of eye candy.  There is a nice dynamic between John Smith and Robert Crawford Jr. as older and younger brother, it's not all sweetness and light.

The versions currently shown on broadcast TV are restored and pristine, so there is no excuse for these awful copies!",1468454400,3,280,4.8936170212765955
4400332,1,B004L5GY82,"I wish that I could tell you how happy I am with my purchase but to be frank I feel that I really got screwed!

Let me first point out that this is not about Amazon.  What they do, they do very well and I have zero problem with them.  The problem is with Timeless Media Group- the amateur company (and let's not forget NBC/ Universal -REALLY?  What MBA was asleep releasing these prints that day?) that states on every disc that:

""This program has been reproduced from carefully selected archival films.  State-of the-art-technology has been used to present the highest quality production.  However, some imperfections in image and sound quality are unavoidable.""

While in this case I would like to call it something else, I'll take the high road and say that this simply is not true!  I didn't pay this much money to watch poorly done DVDs (even the cases were crap!).  They, for all practical purposes, are unwatchable!  Even the color seasons are bad.  I wouldn't be so pissed if they were $10 each, but that's not what I paid. I can watch it on Encore and record it on my (frankly second-rate) COX DVR and see, but not keep, beautifully remastered copies of this very well-done show that is over 50 years old.  Too bad they didn't just DVR it themselves and not create so many disappointed customers.

Where did Encore get their prints?

Timeless Media needs to make this right with all of us; either our money back or at least reasonable quality replacements!",1467763200,18,1466,4.6061776061776065
4400333,4,B004L5GY82,"The majority of the DVD's played fine. There were a few episodes, however, that would stop and you were unable to fast forward to get to a spot to play the remaining episode.

However, when I purchased from Amazon Prime the picture quality is poor as if Timeless Media Group recorded from a VCR then distributed. Paying $35 to $45 is a rip off and each of the seasons should have sold for at the most $10. TMG and NBC Universal should be a shamed for letting this quality of video to be distributed.  Amazon should pull the videos and stop taking people's hard earned money.  The folks who say the video's are in good quality must either work for Amazon or must be blind.

4400336,5,B004L5GY82,"Slim Sherman (John Smith) co-owns the inherited family ranch 12 miles outside Laramie, Wyoming, with his much younger brother Andy (Bobby Crawford, Jr.).  To make a go of it, Slim has a contract to run a stage line relay station, with hired hand Jonesy (Hoagy Carmichael).  One day Jess Harper (Robert Fuller), a drifter with a checkered past, rides in, and winds up staying.  Hoagy Carmichael left after season one, and Bobby Crawford, Jr. after season 2, and were replaced in seasons 3 and 4 by Mrs. Daisy Cooper (Spring Byington) and Mike Williams (Dennis Holmes).  The first two seasons were in black and white, and the second pair in color.

While espousing great family values, this Western series had the usual number of fistfights, barroom brawls, and gunplay.  In every episode, our heroes managed to either get into trouble themselves, or get involved in others' problems.  Sometimes they acted together, and sometimes, more often in the latter two seasons, they alternated starring roles.

While claiming they used the very best available sources for this production on DVD, the quality ranges widely between Good and Abysmal, most notably true of some of the episodes in color.  The worst was in episode 4-10, ""Bad blood,"" where the entire top half of the picture is green, and the entire bottom half, orange; in other episodes, the colors change and fade in and out, and the picture is fuzzy.  Some episodes have obviously been transferred from VHS tapes (...or maybe even Beta!).

If you are lucky enough to live in an area where ""Laramie"" is being broadcast on a GRITtv affiliate station, you'd do better to record it off the air or cable.  The picture and sound, as broadcast, are excellent.  The two drawbacks are that the episodes are not being shown in chronological order, and they are slightly less than full-length.

Based on this production, I will be wary of buying any other product released on DVD by Timeless Media Group.",1464652800,9,1948,4.88145896656535

4400340,4,B004L5GY82,"Laramie is one of my favorite old television shows.  The quality of the writing, acting and production are far superior to what's being placed on television today.  Laramie is pure western and it's an all action show.  Season one is my favorite because of Andy and Jonesy being on the show with Slim and Jess.  Andy and Jonesy left the series after season one and season two was basically just Slim and Jess.  Seasons 3 and 4 added Daisy Cooper and Mike to create more of a family atmosphere.  I give the show 5 stars but the quality of the DVDs in this set is not very good.  They end up with about 5 hours on each disk which results in lower quality.  If you can find this show on broadcast television or cable the quality will be much better.  Seasons 1 and 2 are in black and white and seasons 3 and 4 in color.  The black and white of the first two seasons doesn't take away from the enjoyment at all, actually the picture seems to be better in those seasons.

Thus far I've only had time to play three of the DVD's.  The 1st disk - first episode was very dark and grainy; as though it was transferred from VHS video cassette.  Another episode inexplicably ""froze"" halfway through.  I could never get it to play to the end; or skip over the frozen part.  The 2nd disk is defective.

4400381,3,B004L5GY82,"This show hits the mark and misses the mark at the same time. This is the only season with Hoagie Carmichael.  The 3 stars are for the low quality of the video. The stories are 5 star quality. The problem is that the stories are best when told with both main characters. Throughout the series all four seasons they make the huge mistake of focusing in one of the two characters in an episode and the other character only having a couple of minutes if at all in an episode. My other problem is that the series is titled Laramie, but the series takes place outside of Laramie and most of the stories no where near Laramie. I guess ""Slim and Jess"" would not have worked so they used Laramie. But, really it is the ""Slim and Jess"" Show. The video quality is poor at best, and worse in some episodes. You can easily tell that the episodes are video tape transfers. If the quality of the visual does not bother you, but you like good stories then give this series a try. The stories are solid, though repetitive in many ways and the acting is good.  Hoagie Carmichael is a blast, but he only stayed for this one season. It's a shame.

The jewel boxes are very poor and fall apart at the touch.

I was worried when I read the reviews about the bad video and audio quality and after suffering through extremely terrible videos of Laramie for 4 years, I was thrilled when I put the DVD in my Playstation and pressed play, I could actually see Robert Fullers face clearly.  The video quality was 100 times better. Yes, there is some minor quality issues but that often occurs with all the old shows I have received.  People who except 1080dpi quality from an old show will be disappointed.  Those of us who know better will be thrilled with what we have gotten. I have collected shows such as Trackdown & Johnny Ringo, which were never put on VHS or DVD so you accept any quality of video you can get.  You just want to preserve the history and the sheer joy of the show. Once these show does become available on DVD,  I purchase it. My love for westerns and the appreciation for the work it takes to restore them, means that we should realize we will never get perfection.  I will agree that they could box the DVD's better. Both my Season 2 and my Season 3 were loose and easily fall out of its holders.

4400394,5,B004L5GY82,"I confess to a bias. I am a fan of the Crawford brothers. Johnny, as you may know, starred in The Rifleman, and his brother, Robert Jr., had a few guest appearances. Although I had never seen Laramie on tv, I wanted to see Johnny's brother in a western. Previously I had seen the two brothers in the movie Indian Paint along with Jay Silverheels. Both The Rifleman and Laramie--especially the first season---were unusual for tv westerns of the time as they featured youngsters in mature programs aimed at adult audiences. This is not to take away from the strong scripts of the following seasons; this is just an observation regarding the different direction Laramie took especially beginning with season three.",1393459200,2,711,4.884297520661157

4400396,4,B004L5GY82,"This is an easy to watch western, B&W, with good acoustics. I was pleased with the DVD quality.  The show itself is well written and surprisingly well acted.  Since it is quite old and never having seen the show, I did not know what to expect.  But  I  enjoyed it and am looking forward to receiving the second season.  (of course, I am a closet junkie for old westerns)!
One con would be the difficulty in seeing clearly the night time scenes.  These are not as well done as the daytime scenes and are a cause of some frustration.  Another issue which actually is the biggest problem with the set is the cheap DVD case they come in.  Of the 3 cases which each hold 2 DVD's, none held the DVD in place.  Each DVD was floating in the packaging and could not be returned to the case so it could be closed.  The little button in the middle that holds it in place was broken in each of the 3 cases.  The cost really should rate a case which can keep the DVD's safe and scratch free.",1389052800,4,978,4.1436170212765955
4400397,3,B004L5GY82,"None of these sets is worth over $20 and yes, I did pay more
and wouldn't again.  The stories are predictable, the kisses
and killing both chaste -  no real lust nor blood ever seen here,
m'am.  People die in such a neat, tidy way...completely
unrealistic, but how all old cowboy flicks were before they
went too far in the other direction a la Sam Peckinpah.
And half way through Season 2 I have yet to see a black
face anywhere, which is sad... but of its' time I suppose. I'm
pretty sure no real Mexicans nor folk of First People's
descent appear either, even when the part calls for it.  Would
be happy to be proven wrong!

So, if you can get past all that and remember these are over
50 years old, they are enjoyable in their way.  Seeing folks
who later became superior actors in beginning bit parts is
fun. Some transcend the material, others don't.

Both name stars make credible cowboys and look like they do
their own riding and have been around a barn or two, which is
good to see. And appreciated.  They also appear to have a
genuine male friendship based on more than boozing and
chasing the ladies.  That's nice also, their easy camaraderie.

The quality of the sound on one episode was so poor, as a
non-lip reader I just had to guess what was happening.  But
that's only one episode, which does appear with a warning
about its' quality.

warned....these episodes could all use some technical assistance.",1388016000,4,1476,4.446096654275093

4400399,5,B004L5GY82,"The essence of Laramie rested on the relationship between the two main characters...Slim and Jess!  Season 1 began with how the two came together and how the friendship began.  The story was never the main focus....the same themes reverberated throughout every existing western series.  They were reworked and rewritten over and over again. The year is 1870....five years after the end of the Civil War.  John Smith is Slim Sherman...basically confident, moral, hardworking, loyal, and a product of a seemingly loving family and stable home.  He has ties to the community and deep roots already established.  Into his life rides one Jess Harper (Robert Fuller)....a bone-weary gunfighter with no roots, a hair-trigger temper, and poor self image....who moves from place to place....and as he tells the younger brother, Andy, has gotten used to the lonliness of his life (though there is a certain sadness when he says that!)  Thrown together because of a dangerous situation, Jess is offered a job on the Sherman Ranch.  He accepts the offer....and therein lies the basis of the series.  Jess moves in and out of life on the ranch...but always returns. Somehow we know he will always come back....just as we know he will find a reason to leave.  It takes time for it to become a home for him.  Still, his troubles (as Slim says) always remain a part of who he is.
The casting of Smith and Fuller was perfect.  Smith was first signed to play Jess....but someone realized he would be a better Slim Sherman.  Fuller was cast as Jess Harper. The rapport between them was excellent...they were a wonderful fit...and when they shared the story and the screen, Laramie worked very well.  And, then as happens with successful shows, someone decides to change things...first they let go of certain characters, then they change format (less of the two playing together) in Season 2. Then they add characters in Season 3. They add color in Season 3  (not a bad idea).  But something was lost.....that wonderful relationship that made Laramie special.  Jess begins to mature and calm down....but still shows the grittiness now and then.  Some of the fun of the earlier episodes was their interaction...whether joking, or disagreeing, or caring for each other, or showing genuine concern....or punching each other around.  When they shared the screen, there was a sense of enjoyment.  Yes, they did well when not sharing screen or story...but we needed them to interact with each other....we missed how they played out the relationship between them.  Laramie is one of the best western series ever made....due to the two actors who made it work for the most part.  It is worth watching....I have one criticism, however!  The first two seasons were in B&W....the quality was not the best.  The color seasons were better....but restoration could have been, and should have been, much better!",1386460800,19,2876,4.993697478991597
4400400,5,B004L5GY82,"This is a slow developing show that by the 3rd disk you really start to like.  The two main characters (Robert Fuller and John Smith) basically run a stage relay station and deal with all sorts of unsavory characters. Hoagy Carmichael (I heard the name, but never knew who he was) is the old cook and general maintainance man with Robert Crawford (brother of the young son on ""The Rifleman"")  as the kid brother of John Smith.  These two characters seem to vanish in the second season with no reason and are not replaced.  In the third season a grandmotherly actress and another kid move into the relay station and I still cannot figure out why, who or where they came from. The show had great casting all around with plenty of faces you will recognize if you grew up in the 1950's or 1960's and great scenery too.  A gritty hard shoot em up type western. Someone gets shot in every single episode including the stars, who are always wounded.  I guess the West was really dangerous.

Bad problem with this show is the restoration.  It does not appear to have been digitally restored in the slightest which is a letdown because it leaves the screenshots kind of dark with bad sound too on the first two season disks.  The third season is extremely washed out, very much like the old Cisco Kid TV show.  The actors seem to shake like the old movie projectors we had in elementary school too on the third disk.  Another problem with the third season is the disks make a lot of noise in the DVD player.

Can't figure out who would cancel this series in it's fourth year?  Great show (even though I never saw it or heard of it till I ordered this set).  I think had the product been restored I would be happier with the purchase, but overall I got to see a show I never saw before.

4400404,5,B004L5GY82,"Ah Laramie...how I love thee!  Seriously this is one of the best family westerns on television.  John Smith (Slim Sherman) and Robert Fuller (Jess Harper) are one of the best on screen western bromances ever.  Both of these guys were excellent actors and they just happened to have starred in one of the best hour long westerns.

The first season of Laramie had the addition of Hoagy Carmichael (as the piano playing ranch assistant Jonesy) and Robert Crawford Jr (ash Slim's younger brother Andy) to round out the cast.  Each episode usually focused on the 2 principle characters but on some occasions Jonesy or even Andy would be the driving force of the story.  Most of the scripts were well thought out hour long episodes with little or no interplay between each one so they could be watched in any order other than the first episode where Jess arrives at Sherman Ranch.

The quality on the first season set is a mixed back.  Some episodes are really crisp and sharp picture quality with decent mono audio tracks.  Some episodes have really degraded picture and almost muffled sound. But what do you expect from a series that is over 50 years old and does not have the rabid fan base of shows like Star Trek or Gunsmoke.  Does that make this unwatchable?  Certainly not.  It is a series that needs to be seen by more people.  These are fine written stories and they certainly reflect a time when shows were written for the whole family to watch.  Thanks to Timeless Media for releasing this series and for all their efforts on bringing back classic series and westerns so that more people can enjoy.  It's a shame younger viewers won't give older series a chance. They deserve to be treasured and remembered.",1371686400,,1712,4.66

I was so excited to find it released on DVD and was not in the least bit disappointed when I purchased it.  I am a Robert Fuller fan and he stars in this series as the drifter gunfighter turned ranchhand Jess Harper. John Smith stars as Slim Sherman the ranch owner who was willing to give Jess the opportunity to break away from his 'bad boy' gunslinger past. Slim makes a friend of Jess and we watch their friendship develop in a setting of gunfights, bar room brawls and a host of bad guys that bring along their own special form of drama to the show. Theres something for everyone in this Western. Plenty of action for the fellas and plenty of heart warming moments for the gals. Me, I love both so I couldn't lose. The picture and sound quality is very good, considering season one was in production in 1959. Be warned, though, it is in black and white and while we have been spoilt with perfect HD colour for the last few years, the storylines in Laramie are good enough that after a few minutes we forget that we have turned back the clock to the days of black and white TV.

4400415,5,B004L5GY82,"All 31 episodes from the black-and-white freshman season of this beloved Western action series are included in this 6-disc set, although two of them were apparently made from VHS recordings, since ""no masters [of them] were found in the Universal vaults.""  In 1870, young gunslinger Jess Harper (Robert Fuller) wanders onto the Sherman Ranch outside Laramie, Wyoming, crosses metaphorical swords with its owner Slim Sherman (John Smith), and charms his restless 12-year-old brother Andy (Robert Crawford Jr., whose brother Johnny played Mark McCain in ""The Rifleman"") before helping to outsmart outlaw boss Bud Carlin (played to the hilt by perennial villain Dan Duryea).  Slim, whose survival as a rancher often hinges on the money he's paid by the stage line to provide a relay stop, is in dire need of a hired hand and offers Jess the job.  Though Jess is doubtful at first, he agrees to give it a try, and finds himself with not only work, a roof over his head, a warm bunk and three squares a day, but something he hasn't had since he was 15--a home and a family.  Although his past occasionally intrudes on this new life, and he and Slim don't always see eye to eye even when it doesn't, Jess gradually settles in and shows everyone that there's more to him than a fast gun.

One of the things I like about this series is its look, especially as to the sets.  Sherman Ranch HQ *looks* like a small, struggling, bachelor-household sort of ranch; its furniture is sparse, much obviously homemade.  The town of Laramie includes not only classic false-front frame buildings, but buildings made of logs or squared beams.  This makes up in large part for the historic inaccuracies--Colt Peacemakers, barbed wire--that creep in, as they do to all classic Westerns.

Like the later episodes filmed in color (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laramie-In-Color-Part-One-28-episodes/dp/B001MZVZGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laramie In Color Part One - 28 episodes!</a>), these tend to be more mainline and serious than otherwise, though humor usually intrudes at some point, and are invariably full of good old-fashioned action.  In one, Jess inadvertantly finds himself wearing a badge for the first (but not the last) time in his life and is clearly surprised at how good he feels to be on the side of the law; in two others there are intriguing variations on the range-war trope (one was penned by ""Sherman Vincent Harper,"" which I strongly suspect is a pseudonym for Smith and Fuller); a fourth has the feel of a failed pilot.  Indians and outlaws, gunslingers and an iron-spined line superintendent (based on an actual figure from the pre-Civil-War stagecoach era), restless women and lawmen both straight and crooked fill the scripts, and name guest stars abound, including Ernest Borgnine, Eddie Albert, Nanette Fabray (as a lady evangelist), Lloyd Nolan, Brian Keith, James Gregory (surprisingly playing, not his usual hard-drinking type, but a Franciscan priest, perhaps based on the one who, historically, did in fact, like his character, negotiate a peace with Sitting Bull), John Anderson, John Dehner, a very young Beverly Garland, Edgar Buchanan, R. G. Armstrong, L. Q. Jones, Ben Johnson, Charles Bronson, and many others.  The fourth regular is Hoagy Carmichael, then with over 30 years as a popular songwriter to his credit, who plays cook and choreman Jonesy, and is both charming (in a gruff-old-sidekick way) and surprisingly effective, providing occasional comic relief and a frequent steadying influence on hot-tempered Jess and stern, sometimes over-focused Slim.  But it's Fuller who's at the center of this first season; with his ""lean and hungry look,"" mobile face, and unconscious physical grace, he reveals his character's inwardness gradually and with convincing skill, and you don't wonder that he was probably the favorite of series fans.  If you have only one classic Western series in your video collection, it should be this one.",1352246400,2,4003,5.244131455399061

I had the great pleasure of meeting Robert Fuller in March of this year and he is the kindest, friendliest soul I've ever come across. Knowing the kind of man he is makes watching Laramie even better - Jess Harper was my first love and will always be special in my memory. Now, I can see him anytime I want. Thanks, Timeless Media.

Therefore I certainly have no qualms with my purchase. I hope season two is released soon as I certainly would buy another season just to see the guys some more.

4400433,5,B004L5GY82,"Timeless Media Group presents ""LARAMIE: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" (1959 min/B&W) -- Starring John Smith (as Slim Sherman), Robert Fuller as (Jess Harper), Hoagy Carmichael (as Jonesy) and Robert Crawford, Jr. (as Andy Sherman).

Directed by some of the great B-Western directors:
Lesley Selander, Joseph Kane, Francis D. Lyon, Thomas Carr, a very impressive list.

The jest of the series is about two brothers and a drifter who come together to run a stagecoach stop for the Great Central Overland Mail. Laramie is an American Western television series aired on NBC from 1959 to 1963. The series ran for four seasons and is considered by some to be one of the best family-oriented westerns of its time.

The two lead characters actually ""worked"" on the ranch. They chopped wood, cooked, washed dishes, washed clothes, fed chickens, repaired roofs and did all the chores necessary to running a ranch. This aspect added an authenticity to the lead roles that you didn't see in other series - which was unique for it's time.

Hoagy Carmichael decided not to return after the first season, the weekly filming was too demanding. Spring Byington and Dennis Holmes joined the cast as Miss Daisy Cooper and Mike Williams as the third season began.

Special footnote: -- The main musical theme, written by Cyril J. Mockridge, also was used as the main theme in the 1945 film, ""Thunderhead~Son of Flicka"". (featuring Roddy McDowall and Preston Foster).

Very reasonable and a good value for the price --- For product description and editorial review check this out on the Amazon site above my review.

4400434,5,B004L5GY82,"I loved this western when I was a kid and now am enjoying watching it again as an adult.  Can't wait for season 2 to be released.
Jess and Slim are great characters and in season 1 there are many episodes with both characters. Later seasons the buddy episodes were less and more were either Jess or Slim.

4400435,4,B004L5GY82,"My only experience with Laramie was a quarter century ago when The Family Channel briefly reran color episodes from the early '60's. For reasons unknown, the color on Laramie reruns was dreadful compared to the color on it's contemporary Universal series being rerun in the '80's, including The Virginian, color Wagon Trains, and the color (final) season of Tales Of Wells Fargo. Timeless should be applauded for releasing a full first season, even with several poor quality copies. I wish they had done this with The Texan, where they only included episodes of a certain print quality (about 8 shows are missing from that DVD release).

In 1959, NBC was looking to feature a color weekly western to promote the sale of parent company RCA's color TV sets. The pilots of Bonanza, Laramie, and Riverboat (which starred Burt Reynolds, Darren McGavin and Noah Beery Jr) were filmed in color. Though NBC ultimately chose Bonanza to be all color, it would have been nice if Timeless included the color versions of the pilots of the other two series in their respective releases of Laramie season one and The Best Of Riverboat (though Laramie's color version of the pilot is included in the first episodes of NBC westerns DVD). Great actors of the day populate Laramie, which has good writing and characters. Robert Fuller's favorite job was as Jess Harper on Laramie. I hope Timeless rereleases better prints of the later color seasons, and please bring on season two.",1306886400,13,1462,4.919028340080971
4400436,5,B004L5GY82,"I now own all the published Laramie DVDs (lacking only season two of four seasons). I like the first season in black and white the best. The color of the last two seasons is not the best due to the condition of the original material transferred. I've really treasured being able to see this series all these years later.

UPDATE: Season two was made available and I got it. It is my favorite season and is in black and white too. This is the season without Hoagy Carmichael or Spring Byington. Loved Carmichael but Byington got on my nerves a bit. Not the actresses fault, but she just wasn't that well written. Also missed Andy who only appeared in a few episodes.

Okay, I've not watched every single episode of each series Timeless has released, but I've watched a few from each series I've gotten (The Texan, The Restless Gun, M Squad, Laramie) and I'm just not going to do it anymore.  These guys do it on the cheap and, forgive me for being a cynic, but those reviewers who praise the transfers are either employed by Timeless or are getting kickbacks.  Even Warner Archive has done better transfers with the made-to-order DVDs.  It's a d--n shame these great series get such a lousy treatment.",1304380800,19,766,4.765151515151516
