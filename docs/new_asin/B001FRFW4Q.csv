8302399,5,B001FRFW4Q,"When I first came across this DVD I was unsure if I was going to buy it, but as an AC/DC fan this is a must have copy! When I first put this DVD in I was thrilled already with the song ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap"" playing in the main menu options. The show looks incredible, with amazing image and sound quality. Once again, if you're an AC/DC fan or just know them, this is a must have DVD for anyone.",1313798400,,403,3.926829268292683

If it looks better than the previous release of this concert then I say that's pretty damn good.",1225843200,,312,4.396551724137931
8302403,1,B001FRFW4Q,"ADCD has released a very poor quality (sound and video) ""directors cut"" that fades in and out- sound-wise. For true hardcore fans this is ""dirty deeds done cheap""! Angus you should recall this DVD!",1222473600,,197,4.823529411764706
