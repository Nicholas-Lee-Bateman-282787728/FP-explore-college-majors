8403377,1,B003R9K0FQ,I cannot support anything with Christopher Dimock. He has made fun of the mentally ill on several occasions and has said that people who have PTSD are weak and compared it to crying over a cut finger. He is a disgrace as a human being.,1523318400,,235,4.2444444444444445
8403378,4,B003R9K0FQ,"I watched this film with my friend (director Adrian Santiago), and offered my honest opinions.  I think the acting could be better in many cases, but when you aren't paying people it gets a bit more difficult to fire someone.  That said, Adrian did a great job with what he had to work with.  The basic story is simple enough:  boy sees parents murder, grows up to seek vengeance.  It's the backdrop that makes the film deep.  It is set in TX after the economy, and subsequently the government have collapsed.  Basically local warlords have taken over territories and keep the peace with a very corrupt hand.  With the LAPD no longer responding to 911 calls due to budget constraints and some states flirting with state bankruptcy, this is no longer a fantasy scenario.  The movie does have a handful of gory scenes, but those are not what the film is about.  I highly recommend that anyone that respects the art of film making watch this movie.",1298764800,2,945,4.604790419161676
8403379,1,B003R9K0FQ,"The worst movie. So cheaply made and looks like something a teenager made. Director gave me a copy of the movie and it was the most unbearable, painful experience. Horrible dialog, horrible cinematography, just all over terrible. Effects were bad and looked like corn syrup and red food coloring. Stupid plot. DO NOT WASTE your money on this crap. There is no gore, no action, nothing. It makes itself look like a gory fun time, but it is not.",1296777600,5,443,4.620253164556962
8403380,3,B003R9K0FQ,BRAD HARTLIEP is a major actor in this film and not even listed! Much more important than Scott Mollette or Niko Red Star.,1283472000,,122,4.3478260869565215
