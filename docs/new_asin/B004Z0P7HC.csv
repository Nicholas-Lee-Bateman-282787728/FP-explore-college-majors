However, when it came, it wouldn't work on my DVD - it was only for Region 4 viewers, whatever that means. DVDs sold to the public should be able to be played on any and all DVDs. If they don't, then that should be in the initial description of the product. I sent it back, extremely disappointed.",1335830400,5,391,4.090909090909091
