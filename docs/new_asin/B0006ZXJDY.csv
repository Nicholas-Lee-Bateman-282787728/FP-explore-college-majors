8044331,5,B0006ZXJDY,Great Video!,1447718400,,12,5.5
8044332,5,B0006ZXJDY,THERE IS GOOD INFORMATION ON THIS DVD THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO HELP YOU IN THE TEXAS HOLD'EM GAME.GOOD STARTER DVD,1315008000,,113,4.428571428571429
8044333,1,B0006ZXJDY,"This DVD is a joke. Extremely basic beginner type material and presented in a way that is of absolutely no use to anyone. Caro gives a quick run down on which starting hands are considered playable but gives no indication on how to actually play them ie: which positions they are playable, whether you should raise or call and what to do with them following a raise etc. There is literally zero advice on playing after the flop or on fundamentals like pot odds/ counting outs etc and his garbage on tells is getting really old. This is one of the worst instructional DVD's on the market. Spend your money on any of the ""Expert hold 'em"" series by Fromm, Miller, Jacobs, Stoxtrader etc if you are serious about improving your poker game through DVD instruction. Why does this guy enjoy the status he does in the poker/ gambling world? He's not David Sklansky for crying out loud!",1199318400,,878,4.563291139240507
8044334,2,B0006ZXJDY,"This video is for extreme beginners and most of the material has been covered by Caro in his books ""Fundamental Secrets of Poker"" published nearly 15 years ago(1991) and the ""Book of Tells"" originally published in 1984; both good books but as a video it is lacking and there is nothing new, which is very disappointing. If you have only played in home games or have never played several viewings would give some good basic instruction and introduce you to some of the good common tells that beginners should know.

 This video covers both limit and no limit holdem but doesn't really go enough in depth to cover either game well; it also includes a condensed section on tells. Although the games are structurally identical the differences are so great that most players watching this video will get into too much trouble watching it; he covers most of the basics in three or four minutes each leaving only experienced players understanding what's going on but as it is aimed for novice players it has little value to almost any player-he doesn't go into enough detail for beginners and  and there is little new material for experienced players. Based on these shortcomings it gets a 2 rating.

It is unfortunate when one of the legendary figures in poker puts out mediocre products. His ""Caro's Book of Tells"" is still one of the greatest contributions to poker literature but this video gets a pass. If you are just starting out rent it from Netflix or your local video store. It is short and there are better Holdem videos out there. I think the Howard Lederer videos are much better than this for learning the game.",1161043200,2,1618,4.706713780918728
8044335,1,B0006ZXJDY,"Save your $18 and don't add this one to your cart.  There is very little substance in this video.  Caro provides 10 interesting ""poker tells"" that are worth viewing but you stop at your local bookstore and spend 5 minutes reading his book on poker tells and get the same info.

The rest of the DVD is very, very basic hold-em strategy that even a novice should know.

Mike may be a genius but he isn't sharing much of his grey matter in this DVD.",1127606400,6,446,4.211764705882353
8044336,1,B0006ZXJDY,"Okay the Mad Genius has my utmost respect his pro poker tells video is awesome, but this was designed at teaching ppl to win and just doesnt do it.  It does tell u about starting hands and thats it nothing on how to play after the flop.  Most ppl think after the flop u either have the best flop and bet or you fold.  This is incorrect and this dvd mentions nothing about flopping mid pair draws etc.  It has absolutey nothing on post flop and gets a 1-5 fom me",1120262400,4,461,4.032967032967033
8044337,4,B0006ZXJDY,"Mike Caro's video provides a general overview of the game and general tips and strategies. While the video may be a bit basic for the frequent poker player, it provides some thoughtful tips for the casual or new poker players who are still seeking to develop the basic skills of identifying ""tells"" of similarly skilled players. This DVD is a good start at learning the skills of playing Texas Hold'em.",1114732800,2,402,4.757142857142857
8044338,1,B0006ZXJDY,"You can tell the guy is smart and a poker great. But he is a marginal communicator. It's quite possible he contradicts himself. His tone of voice is that of a pre-school story reader.

He will speak with GREAT EMPHASIS, and have no idea where the end of his sentence is going. So annoying. I want to slug him.

And he totally cheaped out on production value as well. More poorly produced than the average poker show on TV. No excuse.

Has his poker students helping him in key demonstration scenes, but the help he permits them to provide is minimal.",1113782400,6,550,4.425742574257426
8044339,1,B0006ZXJDY,"I expected more from a Mike Caro DVD. Any of the poker books out there will give you better information. Considering it is only 40 some minutes - and no one can distill what's there in a good book to a 40 minute DVD. This is a very basic beginner type DVD and even still there is nothing you can learn or apply from watching it. I'd go by one of the books that has been reviewed 4-5 stars here on amazon, rather than get this DVD.",1109548800,17,430,3.954022988505747
8044340,1,B0006ZXJDY,This a very mediocre dvd.  It is very basic and not very strategy oriented.  Any of the Howard Lederer dvds are far more interesting and give better strategies.  I would not recommend this dvd and think it was a total waste of money.  I think it is also sad that the dvd was used as an advertisement for a casino.,1109116800,14,313,4.166666666666667
