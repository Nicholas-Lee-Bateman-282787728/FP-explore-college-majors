8267379,5,B0017V8Q1G,"In my opinion, this is one of the best series on TV right now. The wife and I love it. It's a clever show, very entertaining and hilarious! The only thing I wish I had done, was to wait to get it on Blu-Ray.",1274659200,,207,3.727272727272727
8267380,4,B0017V8Q1G,"Entourage is clever and funny and has developed some of my favorite characters (the agent who seems to be such a shark but over the years has been written to reveal an inviable moral substrata)that I find very watchable.  Watching Enourage enjoyability is specially improved when the ads and time between episode viewing is eliminated.  Though the characters are all 'lost boys', thier 'Neverland' is the instant gratification world called Hollywood, the story line is both entertaining and interesting to watch.  The writers are clever in developing unfamiliare scenarios that lead the viewer on new paths through the entetainment forest in a satisfying way that makes the casual nudity and adult theme an acceptable adjunct that supports the story and seems more natural than tittilating.  The story is a dream world in which four Jersey boys are sprinkled with Tinderbell dust and fly off to a place that is totally unreal but so far facinating and fun to watch.",1268438400,,965,5.050314465408805
8267381,5,B0017V8Q1G,"Get all these seasons!  What a freaking great show.  I'm a girl and I love it.  It really is more of a guys show, but I get it and appreciate it too.  Ari is hysterical, and I just love me some Johnny Drama!",1223942400,,207,3.744186046511628
8267382,1,B0017V8Q1G,"When I bought this package.. it said it online that it includes session 1 to 3a and 3b.. However when i got it in mail it only had session 1, 3a and 3b.  they did not include session 2.  They also took a long time to ship it (like 15 days)",1223942400,,239,3.6666666666666665
8267383,5,B0017V8Q1G,"I bought the Entourage series on a Gold Box Deal--a whim.  I don't have HBO and had barely even heard of the show, so I had nothing to compare to.  The show starts off in Season 1 as a great watch.  The cast is memorable and humorous, and the story line is pretty easy to follow however I'd be hard pressed to stay attentive week to week after a 30 minute stint for each show.  I tell my friends who've never heard of it that it's a male version of Sex in the City--but not really.  This show doesn't focus on relationships, rather an actor and his brother, cousin, and best friend and their ""lavish"" life in California.  Vince, the main character plays the excellent role in being a ""not so perfect"" actor who in the end tries to stay true to his original game of what he was born to do--acting.  Drama, his brother is absolutely hilarious.  Check out the ""Saigon"" episode; I still chuckle at him in Walsh's hotel room.

Turtle and Eric's characters are true staples in the show. They do more in providing the assists for the humor rather than being the punchlines themselves.

Ari is the absolute quiet thunder in this entire show.  He starts out as ""Vince's Agent"", but is really so much more to the group.  His antics and quips are the most hilarious.  His funniest line (to me) is in one of the episodes where he's trying to land Vince the huge movie.  (I'm not into spoilers)

Watching all the shows together lets you see the evolvement of all the actors.  While Seasons 1-3 had some great runs and a nice ending, Season 4 actually kind of milked itself.  I've got all of one sentence to say about Season 4 (out of them all).  Although it had the same amount of humor as the others--it did evolve in that sense, the actual plot took 12 shows to hash out!  The show kinds of leaves you to carry out your own assessments:  Turtle isn't working with anyone since Saigon and Drama probably isn't cooking because he's so busy with the new show.  There's more, but I won't dwell.  I don't plan to watch Season 5 until it finishes, then I'll probably download it from iTunes or something to that effect.

As I say with all movies and DVD packs, it's better to wait until their cheaper or on sale.",1220227200,,2195,4.352216748768473
8267384,5,B0017V8Q1G,"So this show is just great.  The characters are unique, and seem to have a genuine chemistry on screen.  I bought the first three seasons as a bundle, but I would wait for the fourth season to come out before I did it again.  overall, I am very pleased with my purchase.",1219622400,,270,4.153846153846154
8267385,4,B0017V8Q1G,"I bought this when it was on sale, which I recommend doing. Great show, highly entertaining.",1217376000,,92,4.8125
