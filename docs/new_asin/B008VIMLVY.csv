5185106,4,B008VIMLVY,"Josh Wheadon's run on X-Men was very enjoyable. I'm not  a huge X-Man fan, but this was much better than the ""we are mutants and are discriminated against"" story lines that are so typical.",1355702400,,188,4.529411764705882
5185107,5,B008VIMLVY,"This is an Awesome conclusion to one of the greatest comic video series ever made. I have the whole series now and coudn't have been more pleased with it. I think this should be the new way to do comics from now on. If you get it, you have too get the other three ( Gifted, Dangerous, and Torn). Trust me you will love them.",1355184000,2,324,4.0
5185108,5,B008VIMLVY,"Well, I know there's a lot of different opinions on this series, but mine is that it's great thus far! It is a little strange if you're not used to this type of animation, however, once you get used to it it's fine. It seems to have gotten better since the first one. Either way, I love this and I recommend it to anyone who loves X-Men. And if this isn't for you then that's okay. I hope that this was helpful.",1352160000,2,411,4.024390243902439
5185109,5,B008VIMLVY,If you like graphic novels that are made into an animation series that this is for you! You are going to love this DVD,1387843200,,118,3.9583333333333335
5185110,5,B008VIMLVY,great series. Love the animation and the storyline that brings this epic tale to life. Watch it and love it,1386460800,,107,4.4
5185111,5,B008VIMLVY,"I just finished watching this final volume a few hours ago & wow, this is just great stuff!! I really love motion comics & Marvel Knights truly put's out tremendous work with all their releases thus far. This is the fourth arc in this X-Men tale & seeing John Cassidy's awesome art brought to life with subtle animation & great voice over's is better than going to the movies. Ironically, to me this whole four part series moves just like one long film & it has really hit all the top marks of what makes a true stand out X-men story. I'm surprised DC Comics & Warner Bros. doesn't put out more motion comics like this from some of their more popular & sought after works too. While I love the animated stuff, there's just something special about seeing awesome comic book illustration brought to life right from the pages from some of you favorite comic stories. As far as Marvel Comics is concerned I'd love to see them tackle other stuff like Spider-Man 2099, pretty much anything from Daredevil, or even Nova. Heck, I'd settle for the classic stuff from the 1960's & after too. But all in all, I highly recommend motion comics if you're itching to see something different. This is a seriously cool & innovative form of entertainment.",1371254400,,1237,4.576576576576577
5185112,1,B008VIMLVY,It's comic book pictures with very little animation.  Wish I never purchased it! I do not recommend this to anyone!,1368316800,2,115,4.75
5185113,5,B008VIMLVY,"The final chapter of the Joss Whedon Astonishing X Men story arc doesn't disappoint as it continues the action that has been running the whole series. As I have stated in reviews of the previous titles, this is not a fully animated film, this is a motion comic which has a feel of a living breathing comic panel. If you are not into motion comics then this film isn't for you, if however you don't mind the animation style and are looking for something with a more adult theme then this is for you. I suppose this could work as a stand alone, but it really does go better after viewing the first 3 films. The only drawback is the fact that the movie is broken down into chapters that are about 10-15 minutes long and you have to watch the opening and closing credits after each episode/chapter. Enjoy.",1366502400,,801,4.382550335570469
5185114,1,B008VIMLVY,"Extremely simple line drawings with overly exaggerated expressions such as stereotyped angry tough guy. Just the same stereotypic expressions seen for decades in comic books. Sparse background and even no background. A typical scene shows a close up of a face with only the mouth moving. In fact, practically every scene is a still shot, non-moving prolonged cartoon frame. Little color and even less detail. To further the cheapness is poor audio and not enough budget for subtitles to help in deciphering what was being said.  Redux storyline of future heroes leaving some distant planet to fight the bad guys. Intelligent, creative - not a chance.",1366329600,2,650,5.132075471698113
5185115,5,B008VIMLVY,These drawing are really great to see. And the plot is sweet. They keep getting better and better. Its a really nice version of the Anime drawing. From the first time the started showing this on Tv.,1359244800,3,198,4.378378378378378
5185116,5,B008VIMLVY,"Excellent conclusion to the series.  Excellent writing, the story pulls you in and never lets go.  Joss needs to continue writing marvel stories.",1359072000,4,145,5.260869565217392
5185117,5,B008VIMLVY,"This series is great, but this is the ending do make sure to pick up the others first, the story line takes place well after the x-men cartoon from the 90's and will help catch up those of you who don't read comics.",1356652800,3,215,4.023255813953488

8530924,4,B008VIMLVY,"This DVD is part of an overall story arc. The complete series is, in order:

 1. Astonishing X-Men: Gifted
 2. Astonishing X-Men: Dangerous
 3. Astonishing X-Men: Torn
 4. Astonishing X-Men: Unstoppable

While you can watch the first (Gifted) by itself, as you get through the series, you will need to see the other stories to better understand the overall story.

My only complaint is that there are no subtitles on any of the discs. They would have been especially handy in the last chapter of Gifted where the background sound effects of the action scenes were so high in the mix that you could not make out what the characters were saying.

Also, F.Y.I. the only disc of the series with extra features is Gifted.",1405468800,3,716,4.672

8530926,5,B008VIMLVY,"An excellent series to watch if your a marvel X-men fan. This series is meant for older fans and not for children who probably wouldn't really go for this style of animation and some of the violence in it may spook younger children, unlike the 90's X-men cartoons people die in this and don't look to pretty after it.
Throughly recommend.",1394323200,,338,4.557377049180328
