8021210,5,B00023BM52,"The movie is very beautiful! Sears will to survive out there a lot of that happened is remarkable. This is a good film to show to your children. Even though the story is about work to and the evil that happen in it, this film shouldn't be forgotten and should still viewed for years to come. this is an Australian film. The quality is not going to be as excellent. The film was made in 1980. The quality is the same thing as in this VHS and DVD.The DVD is in VHS quality.",1419552000,,471,4.075268817204301
8021211,2,B00023BM52,unfortunately quality was very poor I was unable to view it but it is probably understandable as it is VHS and old.,1378339200,,115,4.2727272727272725
8021212,3,B00023BM52,"Low budget animation over film footage.  The story begins interestingly enough with a family fleeing into the forest to escape an invasion.  Later they live in the forest and finally all but Sarah are captured.  The middle of the movie becomes incredibly long though with music and repetitive animation sequences seeming to go on forever, as Sarah plans to destroy a bridge and then survive the winter.

The film is admirable for what it undertakes and does have many surprisingly moving (if not beleivable) moments, but could have done with a serious editing job.  Sometimes the animation just seems like backdrop to the interesting musical score: Vivaldi's Four Seasons, and some solo clarinet work by Giora Feidman.  Sara and the Squirrel is at least a unique piece of work running at a somewhat long 64 minutes.",1208131200,,815,4.955882352941177
