8020638,3,B00022LI3E,"I recall seeing these movies on TV when they first appeared and I also remember Spade Cooley's TV show so I was curious to see if I still found them enjoyable. I sadly say that time has not been kind to these and faults I didn't recall were very obvious now, such as low production qualities from a small independent studio.",1408752000,,324,4.327868852459017
8020639,3,B00022LI3E,"This DVD is only for the true Spade Cooley fan, or someone doing research. The production values have not aged well.

With that said, I was rather surprised to learn that Spade Cooley was quite media savvy. He starred or appeared in many films (even producing his own), had a TV show, and of course had a successful music career. Unfortunatley, all his accomplishments seem to be overshadowed by his murder conviction. Those kinds of things tend to derail one's career . . .",1387324800,,474,4.642857142857143
8020640,2,B00022LI3E,"This video is for B Western buffs only. Spade Cooley, who was a great fiddle player and band leader, produced some of his own pictures including these. They make B Westerns look like the production values of Gone With The Wind. However, he was one of the very few B Western stars that filled his movies with humor. They are comedies with Spade as the butt of the joke. He looks a bit like a shorter wider Roy Rogers, but unfortunately that's where any semblance to acting ends. I had fun watching these and remembering my childhood, but if you are looking for good B Westerns, pass on this.",1327363200,,590,4.422018348623853
8020641,4,B00022LI3E,"Spade Cooley was not your typical B Western ""hero"". The cowboy movies where he played the lead character seemed like a parody or even a satirical commentary (intentionally or not) on B singing cowboys of that period. This Alpha DVD contains two of his rare three movies where he played lead. Alpha obtained somewhat passable to good copies of prints and released these in DVD. Despite all, Cooley can sing and his western songs have the bounce that Autry's or Rogers' do not have. Unlike the two, Cooley's personal life took a tumble later in his carrer when he was convicted of killing his wife. You'd never expect it from the soft spoken cowboy hero you see on the screen.",1090281600,3,674,4.625
