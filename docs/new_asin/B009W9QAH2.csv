5370042,4,B009W9QAH2,"You have to watch this movie with the understanding of the movie's purpose. The purpose of this movie is to show a lot of handsome men with minimal clothing in sensual but not overtly hard core scenes. With this in mind, the movie definitely achieves its mission, especially for anyone such as myself who's a major fan of star Jon Euler/Addison Graham. If you're looking for a riveting mystery, spectacular special effects, or oscar-worthy acting performances, you will be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for hot eye candy, and you prefer your circulation to go from your brain to other parts of your body, however, this movie will not disappoint.",1458864000,,654,4.954545454545454

5370051,1,B009W9QAH2,"This is a film that only deserves a review because of others so bad you cant even attempt one. There is some plot there, though awfully developed: the good vampires are menaced by the appearance of a bad vampire trying to form a squad of vampires to fight...what are they fighting for? There the story stays, and all is only explained in the end.
But he film wouldnt be so bad if the actors could minimally act. They deliver their lines monotonously, with no space for emotion. Do Vampires have no emotion at all?
The battle scenes so poor you think they are there just to show some frontal nudes, something the leads and other characters are always ready to offer. Even for a great vampire fan this film is a flop, intended for a gay audience with very low expectations.",1441324800,,771,4.475177304964539

This is not a equal to ""Lostboys : another brood.""  It is a sequel to another vampire movie aimed at a different audience.

This is a gay vampire flick.  Not really my thing, but I do not judge.  I think gay men would enjoy this more than I did.  There is some nudity.
Slightly above amateurish movie making with some forced sounding dialogue. Yet, a decent story. If you have not accepted the LGBT community in real life, then you will not like this movie.  I don't have a problem with gay themed movies and  I actually applaud this movies existence as entertainment aimed at a gay audience.

I did like the messages of peace and love among the vampire community in this film and their desire to exist peacefully with humans.  It was a welcome change.

The acting and direction felt a little forced and the story not told like you would find in big named directed movies. But I like vampire movies and am open to new and different interpretations.  Hopefully the stock of films for a gay audience will grow in size and quality.",1435795200,,1241,4.385964912280702

5370067,2,B009W9QAH2,"I can't believe they made a sequel to this train wreck of a movie, more importantly I can't believe that I actually watched it. LoL.
But to be fair, the sequel is much better than the 1st.

There is some character development....in the form of Tara, who actually had more of a role in this movie.
The rest of the cast was completely replaced. I can kind of see why & I'm glad they got rid of those ""butter faces"" to make room for a more attractive group. But it made trying to figure out who was who rather difficult. I think each character should have a distinctive feature, like: a tattoo, piercing (eyebrow ring, lip ring, nose ring), always wearing a certain color, always wearing a specific article of clothing (scarf, dickie, hat, glove, eyepatch), or hair color (streaks, or odd hair color) that makes him/her instantly recognizable.

The new characters had some characterization to them...especially Demetrius & Tyler.

I'm glad they added more action, violence, nudity & sex, but it was all poorly executed.

The fight scenes were awful. The violence was lacking at best. Even though I find the nudity appealing. It was gratuitous, it made no sense in the plot & just seemed to happen for no reason....especially in that 1 fight scene. I could understand if they were in the shower & a fight broke out, or if someone was in the middle of changing or having sex & an intruder appeared. But in some scenes they got naked for no apparent reason.
And why are there no female nude scenes? If they are willing to show so much dick, I don't see why they aren't at least willing to show some breasts.

The sex scenes were a little better...though I'd like to see them pushed a bit further & have them appear more often. The simulated sex on cable tv is better & I don't know why they are willing to show so much full frontal nudity, yet skim on the simulated sex scenes (which would add more to the sexual aspect of the movie more than merely showing a few limps dicks).

I liked how the story ended. Two couples who seemed to truly be in love.

They need to explore more of each of the characters' pasts, because that's generally what vampire series are about.....the circumstances of their lives & how they became vampires & what they've experienced in the time they've walked the earth (as both mortal & immortal).

Hopefully if they make another movie it'll have better acting, character development, plot & sex scenes.",1425081600,3,2424,4.5691244239631335

Plot is convoluted and, well, boring.  Acting, I have to agree with many others, is plain out deplorable.  The big fight scene?  I didn't know whether I should laugh or puke....

I understand that getting every single character back is impractical, but if they could have at least got the same people for Jason and Caleb, or at least a close double for Jason like they Caleb, it would have redeemed some of this movie. I did enjoy seeing Terra being played by the same actress.

Now, for the plot. I appreciate them connecting the two movies and connecting them well actually. However, there were details of the first movie that were completely overlooked or disregarded in the second one. I don't feel this movie evolved as it progressed, meaning there was the same level of acting throughout. It's like the actors never became comfortable with their character. And although I, along with most others here, didn't mind the nudity, there were parts of it that I had no idea why they were naked.

If they couldn't get the original actors this would have been a better movie with a different ""New Brood"" storyline away from the Jasin/Caleb coven. They did the same thing in Eating  Out 1 & 2 plus a few other movies  which irritates me when they do that.  If an actor can't play a character in a sequel they should just write that person(s) out and move on.",1366156800,12,554,4.288461538461538
