This very very bad copy will not play on any dvd player in Australia & you don't get a refund because you have opened it only to find that it will not play,plus you don't get a new one even when you write to the company to tell them the problem you are having with something thay have sold you. DON'T BUY DVDS FROM AMAZON YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DID.",1294185600,,466,3.814432989690722

1235048,5,B00000JLX7,"Oh wow, this movie is so cool.  The vilan is so bad that you just want to jump into the tv and get him yourself.  You will root for the good guy as he beats up all of the vilans who more than deserve the poundings they get.  Brian Bosworth delivers a great performance.",1283644800,,269,3.9444444444444446
1235049,4,B00000JLX7,"Football star Brian Bosworth gives a splendid performance as Army drill sergeant John North.  His gorgeous wife and pixie-faced daughter are living near his base and happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are murdered.  During his failed attempt to rescue them from a convenience store, North is shot several times and put into a coma.  When he revives, he is determined to kill the slimy Marcus (Jeff Kober) who is responsible for destroying his family.  However, he soon learns that Marcus is connected to a crooked FBI agent Karl Savak (Bruce Payne), an evil, conniving man who's determined to retrieve rifles stolen from the corrupt Army personnel whom he murdered.  There is a tremendous amount of backstabbing and double crossing in this extremely violent and suspenseful action flick.

  Through it all, North tracks down Marcus but is unable to kill him.  He is determined to be a good testimony for a young boy Mikey (DeJuan Guy) who is selling drugs for the mobsters on the mean streets of Las Angeles.  North is an action hero with a heart.

  ""One Man's Justice"" defines action.  It has plenty of plot twists, explosive violence, and gory deaths.  It is also about setting a good example.  North is determined not to avenge the death of his family by killing Marcus in front of Mikey; he hopes that Mikey won't avenge the death of his own friend.  Contrary to the artwork on the DVD jacket, revenge is not everything.  Love is everything . . . at least it is for John North.

  ""One Man's Justice"" is my first Brian Bosworth film.  Now, I hope to see more of his other films.  If you enjoy violent escapism where justice is served and a moral is taught, see ""One Man's Justice.""",1240099200,3,1705,4.61
1235050,3,B00000JLX7,"Trash Action. This is part of a new genre I like to call Trash Action. You get reasonably B grade actors. Usually ex-wrestlers, football players, et cetera. You put them in a role they totally aren't suited to like a Marine, FBI Agent, Smoke Jumper, et cetera. You get some decent music in it with some rockers in the cast. Come up with a story were there is lots of action, shooting, and music cranking, and you have TRASH ACTION! So leave the brain in hypnotised mode and stuff your face with popcorn cause you're now entering the Mindless Fun Zone. Definitely worth a rental, but it will take a real fan to buy it. Better than ""The Marine"", but I like ""Firestorm"" best.",1183939200,4,672,4.42741935483871
1235051,1,B00000JLX7,"In a movie where Brian Bosworth (Blackout) goes on a vengence spree after the bad dudes who killed his wife and kid, sounds interesting doesnt it, but trust me, this action/thriller sucks bigtime. Too much of a bad thing and we get some pretty corny acting. Also, this is a movie people where Rapper MC Hammer (He is credited as Hammer) portrays a druglord...so you do a math. Bruce Payne (Dungeons and Dragons, Passenger 57) in full blown long hair tries to deliver us a calm and cool collective badguy but ends up delivering a really corny and annoying part. When doesnt Payne play a dipstick badguy? Jeff Kober (Demolition High, A Man Apart) also stars as one of Payne's lackies. The action is really weak and the acting is even weaker. Dont expect much for this constipated ride....rent something else.",1113350400,,806,4.723404255319149
1235052,5,B00000JLX7,"ONE MAN'S JUSTICE, directed by Kurt Wimmer, is a surprisingly effective revenge thriller, buoyed by the performances of Brian Bosworth (in arguably his best role) as an Army sergeant out to avenge the brutal slaying of his wife and daughter, and a deliciously villainous turn by a long-maned Bruce Payne.  Add a nasty spin by Jeff Kober (FALCON CREST), and you have the makings of a sharp and tense thriller.  Just when you think Payne has been as vicious as he could be, he pulls one more little trick out of his hat, and his over the top cruelty is disturbingly effective.  Rapper MC Hammer as crimelord Dexter Caine doesn't do much with the little he's given, but he tries hard.  the little boy who plays Mikey (can't remember his name) is very good, if a little too tough to be loveable.

All in all, Boz delivers in this one.",1096243200,3,830,4.506666666666667
1235053,5,B00000JLX7,"One Man's Justice is an awsome movie, and might be one of Brian Bosworth's best films. it is truly a good movie, and might be considered a cult classic.
it has one of the best lines of all time.  Bosworth is surrounded by about 4 or 5 guys, he throws a bag on the floor, pulls out a cell phone and calls 911 and says, ""i'm gonna need (starts counting) 5 bodybags!"" LOL!!!!!!!!!!
then beats the crap out of all of them. it's a very good movie that you are guaranteed to enjoy. bosworth does a very good job in the movie.  also, MC Hammer comes out as a drug dealer who is trying to cope with the death of his brother.
the villian in the movie is also awsome. he has long blond hair and a pierced nose and plays the villan awsome.
i highly recommend one man's justice.
it's one of bosworth's best movies.",1076544000,14,802,4.134615384615385

THIS MOVIE WAS SUPRISINGLY WATCHABLE AND IT WAS SUPRISINGLY INTERESTING. BRUCE PAYNE MAKES A GOOD VILLAIN. BUT, I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT, MC HAMMER LOOKS VERY SILLY PLAYING A CRIME LORD. IT MAY NOT BE DEATH WISH, BUT THIS MOVIE WILL SATISFY THE AVERAGE ACTION FAN. THIS MOVIE IS WELL WORTH A LOOK.",1067904000,5,475,4.734939759036145
1235055,4,B00000JLX7,"This film could have gotten 5 stars, but it just didn't have enough to push past the 4.
The fight choreography would make even ""Blade"" and ""Blade II"" fans happy. The aikido sequences are flamboyant, to say the least.
The Boz does a pretty decent job of acting in this film, which makes me wish he'd do more.
Like I said, this film could have gotten 5 stars, but there was just something missing, although it deserves a solid 4 stars.",1037836800,2,433,4.3580246913580245

7912830,3,B00000JLX7,"One Mans Justice  This is a light-weight production with not much of a plot, but the picture has some fun moments, such as the martial arts action (better than the usual) and the scene where the male lead takes the motorcycle away from an LAPD MC cop. The real problem, though, is that the long-haired FBI man (along with his cronies), is absolutely unbelievable as a federal agent, and his easy removal of a murder suspect from jail is absolutely ludicrous. This totally undermines the credibility of the film, and lowers it to the comic book level.",1434585600,,550,4.670103092783505
