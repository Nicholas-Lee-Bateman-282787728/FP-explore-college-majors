2455059,5,B000CBCUJG,"This is probably my favorite of all the exercise videos I own or have tried (and there are many!).  If you do all of the segments, it will take almost an hour (but don't worry, it is well chaptered, so you can pick and choose to do fewer if you are short on time). You will stretch, you will practice balance, you will move lightly and freely - without having to learn any tricky steps  (and best of all with no shoes required) and best of all, afterwards you will know you have done something nice for your body, without feeling beat up or worn out. Simple enough for beginners, yet still appropriate for for intermediates and advanced who need something for a lighter day.  Want to feel rejuvenated?

2455063,5,B000CBCUJG,The Anti Aging Method by Carol Argo an excellent exercise video.  It is very easy to follow and moves smoothly from one exercise to the next.

I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and I can do this workout even when I am experiencing a flare-up. The dance section is fun and non regimented so you can add your own moves. The pilates helps loosen my tight areas, particularly lower back and hips. Carol's workout partners are like everday people which also helps to motivate.
I will be looking for more of Carol Argo's workouts. She's the best for us ""seasoned"" people who have pain issues.",1475366400,6,546,4.639175257731959

2455068,5,B000CBCUJG,"Very athletic most of my life, I was discouraged by the aches and pains of middle age which became my excuse for not exercising.  I'm blessed to live in the area where Carol teaches and I began taking her classes one year ago.  Shortly after I started her class, I bought this excellent DVD. The Anti-Aging Method provides extra opportunities to practice what I've learned in class.  The  DVD is easy to follow and varied levels of fitness are represented.  The workouts blend several types of movement while encouraging body awareness.  Although there are options for shorter workouts, I nearly always use the entire program because it is a joy to move so effortlessly.  I end each session feeling stronger; my balance, posture, and confidence have all improved using Carol's method.  I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to feel younger and stronger.",1472428800,,856,4.895833333333333

2455070,5,B000CBCUJG,"Carol Argo's Anti-Aging Method offers a great mix of different exercise options (yoga, tai chi, dance, pilates) for busy, on-the-go boomers and  active seniors who want to tone and stretch their bodies without having to leave home and head for a gym. The video is about 50 minutes long and moves quickly. I especially like that it is broken up into different segments so I can take a break in-between if I don't have time to do the entire video at one time. Viewers can do a segment or two in the morning and then finish up later in the afternoon. My favorite part (besides the yoga) is the free flow dancing.  Carol 's instructions are clear, and her movements are easy to follow unlike other  work-out videos that I have used in the past.  If you are serious about staying active and fit, then I highly recommend the Anti-Aging Method.

2455071,5,B000CBCUJG,"I felt compelled to write a review (even though I don't write very many) for carol Argo because I absolutely love this video. I actually did this workout on a free channel on my rocku so didn't buy it here but I would totally buy it if the channel ever gets rid of it.  I did it with my mom who is 60 and just had knee surgery (I'm only 30) it's completely low impact so she can do everything but I enjoyed it too even though I can handle much more intense cardio and impact workout. I absolutely love the mix of yoga,Thai chi, and dance. The dance is not choreography,it's completely free movement for you to ""do it your way""and you can really modify it however you want. I found this totally fun! The instructor talks kind of funny but by the end i actually liked it because it helped feel more hippyish and get involved.",1459728000,2,823,4.208860759493671

I have been addicted to Aerobic exercises for more than 30 yrs. including spinning, weights, steps, trade mils, u name it. I even had group exercise instructor training, personal training and level 2 Yoga fit certificates. I belonged to 3 different gyms, exercised 6 days a week for 2-3 hours. I also sit for hours using the computer for work and pleasure. A year ago, I started to get lower back and hip joint pain. I went from one chiropractor to another without much improvements. Ten month ago, I was fortunate to get the Ani-Aging Method DVD through good friend.  Initially I did the whole workout twice a weak and use the 6 minute chair exercise during my break from the computer. The Anti-Aging Method combines unique fusion of Yoga, Tai Chi, Dance and Pilates. It wonderful routine. Time passes fast and result in relaxation and energizing. YOU BODY WILL THANK U.  Appling Carol's AAM workout program enabled me to establish a balanced group exercises routines for myself, at the gym. I spend half of my exercise time on fusion Yoga, Pilates and NIA. I have internalized the Anti-Aging method and employ it regularly, first thing in the morning.

I always feel better and energized after doing even just one segment. I'm often short on time in the morning so doing a short segment is great for me.  I can definitely tell the difference on the days I don't Energize in the morning.

Carol's instructions are right on target.  I find her voice and the way she speaks very encouraging and pleasant.

I have switched out three of my weekly sessions with this workout and have realized that this routine has resulted in significantly strengthening my core.

2455102,5,B000CBCUJG,"Despite having read the reviews I questioned my purchase when I first skimmed the DVD and saw the 'dance' section. But surprised myself by doing the entire DVD first time through and enjoying the entire workout!

Being middle-aged, with too many years of being sedentary...and using a cane for an unsteady gait... this DVD provides a good challenge but isn't overly difficult. The standing balance work is already showing promise (moving in/out of the weight shifts helps). I'm hoping, at some point, to be able to do the spins. The mat work is thorough and well-paced. (Altho the 'Long and Strong' section could use better cueing, especially in positions when trying to view the DVD is difficult.)

I've dabbled in tai chi, Pilates and yoga for decades and this seems to be nearly the perfect combination for me. I appreciate that for us boomers, or others with similar issues...who may be moving slower, more tentatively and with reduced range of motion... this workout utilizes movements that force us to react more quickly, be less hesitant, feel more fluid and coordinated. The flow and change-up in the steps also prevents it from being routine (like my 'walking' DVDs). I do struggle a bit with trying to choreograph my moves to mirror those on the DVD instead of just improvising freely, and uninhibitedly, as Carol instructs.

Definitely recommend this fun...and amazingly effective.... DVD. I find it provides quick results along with a good sweat. After only a few days, I could feel my core had been worked, hips were loosening up. I might start out feeling sluggish but always end up invigorated and noticeably more limber, looking forward to doing it again. Add me to the list of others who'd like to see another DVD like this from Ms Argo.",1271980800,19,1754,4.879194630872483

It's kind of slow and the 'free-form' parts were not really needed so much.  It's just an okay workout for beginners (which I still consider myself) and could probably still use if you're intermediate or just lots older than me (50's).,1267660800,3,367,4.140845070422535

It is by biggest hope that Carol Argo would consider developing a similar DVD. As there is nothing out there that comes close to the variety and uniqueness of of the Anti-Aging Method video.
I have been exercising for 30 years and can't count the number of aerobic, yoga, pilates, spin, tai chi (and just about every variation of these) classes I've taken so I can tell right off if the exercise video is a good one or not. I began by checking it out of my local library and knew it was one I had to own. Carol Argo is a pro who mixes the movement of dance, yoga and tai chi with a gentle, yet invigorating routine. The music is good and the teaching is excellent as she explains why some of the moves are necessary and why we do them. I've had this DVD for several years and have not gotten tired of it -- but I do wish she'd produce another one similar. I don't hesitate to recommend this DVD to any of you who want variety & information mixed with a low impact (and did I mention FUN) workout.

I have a weak left leg due to an accident years ago and I am not able to do high impact aerobics. I found that this DVD gave me a workout that I could sweat to and not be hard on my leg. The exercises created by Carol are truly amazing and I would actually find myself looking forward to them during the sequences. It wasn't hard to follow Carol and I liked how she incorporated Tai Chi and Yoga stretching in this DVD. The relaxation element to this DVD at the end is great and I find that very important in an exercise DVD. Overall very impressed and this DVD has stayed in rotation with my morning workout. It gives me that much needed cardio in the morning to get me going.

Side note: I love the extras in this DVD. They seem realistic and even weren't totally perfect in their execution of the sequences. This gave it a more real feel for me. Good energy and flow with having people that don't seem like robots.",1257897600,7,1016,4.183673469387755

2455112,5,B000CBCUJG,"I bought the Anti-Aging Method DVD in December and use it about 2-3 times a week.  It's wonderful when I can't get outside to walk.  Carol keeps me happy dancing and bending in ways I wouldn't think about without her.  I'll be 70 years old next week and I hope to keep thinking young with Carol Argo. I like the way she gradually warms up the body to get us going - the exercise period passes quickly.  The dance of the universe is my favorite, while the abdominal crunches are the most needed.  I'm so enthusiastic about this program that I bought my forty-something daughter her own copy of the DVD for Christmas.  I highly recommend it!",1232755200,9,639,4.418803418803419
2455113,4,B000CBCUJG,"It's a pretty good workout tape. It's more of a strenghthening and toning work out. I'm not really crazy about the flowery words she uses, but this is just a personal preference. Also, the floor exercises I find somewhat aggravating - because I have to stop and see what they are doing - it puts a strain on my neck trying to watch. Sometimes I just sit there till they get in position and then do the same. But, I find I have to do this in other exercise tapes too. It is kind of a low stress, feel good tape, and it does make you feel energized, for the most part. If you are going to buy an excercise tape, this is a good place to start.",1229385600,21,640,4.0078125

2455122,5,B000CBCUJG,"I hate to exercise, although when I'm finished I feel oh-so-virtuous. But it's not fun--actually, I don't like yoga, tai chi or anything else that smells of ""working out""--yuck! Then a friend, concerned about my ""Oh, I'm going downhill"" attitude, gave me Carol Argo's Anti-Aging Method as a gift. I looked at it and scoffed,""Another ""method"" that's going to make me thin, beautiful, and young forever."" Being bored one day, I popped in the DVD, and it was rather a revelation. Carol Argo's method is actually fun, combining disciplines that I wouldn't want to do by themselves for any length of time, but the variety and combination are irresistible. Carol seems to be a living testimony to daily exercise as a way of life, but she doesn't make you feel like a giant fat klutz!  Not only did I feel virtuous, but energized and hopeful--not that I could recapture my youth, but do a workout that will help me look as young as I feel in my head! (More or less!) You can begin with parts of the DVD, which is not intimidating at all. Work up to doing more every day, week, or whatever. You're in your own home and no one is going to judge or bully you! Carol's enthusiasm is contagious. Bonus: I've lost inches, sometimes invite previously reluctant friends to do the routines with me--now, that's fun!",1208131200,23,1299,4.623376623376624

My mother was an athlete in her young age and spent a lot of time practicing and preparing for the competitions. After she quit Big Sport she was always very active in any possible fitness programs. But with age she started experience pain in her hardworking joints which limited her fitness activities.
After discovering Antiaging method my mother (72 years old, no English speaking) started practicing with DVD every day. At the beginning there was discomfort in some movements, but she did not quit. After 2 weeks of movements with Carol's method she was happy to realize that her shoulders and knees were working properly and pain significantly reduced.
After being exercising for a year, my mother feels much younger, more active and confident to be back to shape. Pain is gone!!!
Thank you to Carol and her amazing transformational program that helps people to get back to normal, active live and feel young again. The method is very balanced, easy to learn and follow, even without understanding English, and it is fun.",1207872000,41,1109,4.904255319148936
