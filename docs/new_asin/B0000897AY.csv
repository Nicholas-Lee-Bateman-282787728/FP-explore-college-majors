7980449,5,B0000897AY,"this is a great rare Deep Purple DVD containing 3 German TV appearances from the Fireball era
""Highway Star"", ""No No No"" and ""Hallelujah""

""Highway Star"" and ""No No No"" are also on the History, Hits & Highlights DVD.",1264377600,,216,4.538461538461538
7980450,2,B0000897AY,"I was mislead by the title (a critical review). My expectations was that this is the story of DP and what happened between mark II, III and IV. Not a clue. The dvd contains TV-recordings and some folks comments. I just expected some historical background, like what was actually the reason that Gillan and Blackmore are not excatly best friends etc. I got more background history from Coverdales homepage (and Glenn Hughes' as well). This is not a critical review. This is video from BBC together with bla-bla-bla from more or less unknown people.",1136851200,,547,4.829787234042553
7980451,4,B0000897AY,"I would've given this ""5 stars"" but there's only 3 songs on it! [More please! -- heh heh].

You get a big fancy menu on this DVD that let's you see ""Highway Star"" or ""No, No, No"" or ""Hallelujah"", which were all from the German [pre-MTV days!] show ""BEAT CLUB"".

That show probably had the best use of 'chroma-key' & 'luma-key' effects [almost comical!] but by 1970, when the show went colour, the band's started PERFORMING their songs & NOT 'myming' [with few exceptions like ""The Nice"" & ""Humble Pie"" who performed LIVE on BEAT CLUB in B&W 1969] it depended on the BAND.

""Highway Star"" & ""No, No, No"" are both ROCKIN' LIVE no-nonsense performances! [Yeah!] Both are in colour & look like they were shot the same session[?]

""Hallelujah"" in THIS DVD uses a BEAUTIFUL 'stereo audio track' they re-sync'd with the original B&W TV appearance, which was a 'myme' job in the first place.

I first saw ""Hallelujah"" on a TV series called ""The Golden Age of Rock & Roll"" [early 90s] hosted by 'John Sebastian' [""Lovin' Spoonful""].

It's nice to finally have IT on DVD, along with these 2 others!

The REST of this DVD's menu is cluttered up with 'previews' for OTHER DVDs on the label [more 'ads' than show! :-(]

Anyway, look for other ""BEAT CLUB"" DVDs -- they ARE available --

to a degree...",1127952000,,1287,4.536796536796537
7980452,2,B0000897AY,"Three video clips from German TV , lots of swirling backgrounds and colours but lots of Live  Deep Purple too. This release could be considered worth the purchase price for the version of No,no,no alone, where Richie Blackmore shows he is a very underated player indeed as he kicks this tune along with consumate ease. He just makes playing the guitar look effortless. The version of Highway star suffers a little from Ian Gillan fooling around with the lyrics and tune but both this and Hallelujah are sure to be of interest to Purple fans.
The DVD jukebox would have been better without the cheap and uninspiring advertising that almost ruins Emerson Lake and Palmer and stops me from watching more than 10 seconds of any one else. Shoddy.",1058918400,4,741,4.744186046511628
7980453,3,B0000897AY,"Ok, so you may pass this one up because there's only 3 Purple tunes, and let's face it, ""Hallelujah"" isn't one of their best. But, it IS the first song the classic Mk II lineup recorded and its a never before released promo at that. You know, it shows where they began, and that's real rock'n'roll history for sure. If its any consolation, Gillan's vocals are superlative and this opened the doors to his 'Jesus Christ Superstar' fame. The other two songs, ""No No No"" and ""Highway Star"" are real interesting with the former, in this version, given a helluva fun treatment that lays waste to the plodding 'Fireball' version. It just oozes confident attitude and slides on a slippery bedstone of Purple funkiness, the kind that fit their sound to a tee. Gillan improvises effotlessly with Blackmore, spouting off amusing asides. They in the pocket! As for ""Highway"", we get to see the band fearlessly rip through an incomplete version that's still very close to the 'Machine Head' version in many respects, excepting that Blackmore's and Lord's solos are still wholly improvised at this point. Gillan sings more rougher and higher, an interesting contrast to what we know, and his off-the-top-of-the-head lyrics involving Steve McQueen, Bridget thingy(Bardot probably), and ""Micky Mouse(mentioned in ""No No No"" as well, so was he a wee tipsy? heheh)and all that love""(? lol). This is Purple really enjoying themselves and yes, Gillan and Blackmore clearly are having fun together here. So where else are you gonna find this true classic rock footage, with DTS sound option at that? There are these pointless promotional video excerpts of older artists tacked on, nothing to do with Purple. I mean Procol Harum was great, but there's only Gary Brooker and Mathew Fischer left in this later clip they show, and well,none of these things matter. Get it for Purple. It would have been nice if the promo for ""Black Night"" was included, even if they've finally released it on the 'Machine Head' video. For Purple freaks, but you already knew that, didn't ya?",1051574400,6,2050,4.927745664739884
