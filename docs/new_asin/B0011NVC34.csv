8242189,3,B0011NVC34,"this documentary isn't a complete academic overview of minorities in the lands between sarajevo and palestine, but rather a visit with various individuals (none of them politicians) in bosnia, kosovo, macedonia, albania, turkey, syria, lebanon and palestine. with no knowledge of the history of these places a viewer could feel lost, but perhaps listening to these people may be an invitation for further study. what criteria was used for choosing whom to film is not clear, but ""extremists"" advocating revenge are not presented. at over two hours this dvd is generously unhurried and doesn't stamp out these peoples' individuality.",1209081600,,632,5.393939393939394
