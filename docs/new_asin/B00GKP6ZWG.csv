8624191,1,B00GKP6ZWG,Horrible acting. Horrible cinematography. Horrible script. In short...just a horrible horrible horrible film.,1437177600,,109,7.461538461538462
8624192,5,B00GKP6ZWG,"Wow! This is an awesome film! Director, Justin Viggiano creates an intense thriller than any audience can enjoy. It is put together very well, each moment, filled with suspense, leaves you sitting on the edge of your seat (like I was). The film sends a powerful message; to accept each other for who we are, and if you mess with that; there will be consequences... You would never guess this was made by one man with an idea at the age of 27! The story really comes together wonderfully at the end, but you need to watch the ENTIRE film to realize that. It's well worth the money!  I cant wait to see what else this guy has to offer. So many big budget films today are worthless and have no message (which is so vital), but this film is different, it has several takeaway lessons embedded within it, as you will see. This guy IS the next Spielberg, mark my words!",1406592000,,863,4.327160493827161
8624193,5,B00GKP6ZWG,"The story held you together.  My curiosity was peeked constantly and for a film that was on a gorilla budget and a strong independent it in itself can open up doors with the ideas in the film industry.  I believe that a big budget would give it more visual substance but overall it was great quality, story, and a strong post production product.  I would say the next film by this director will make waves...don't sleep on these artists..",1403136000,2,438,4.518987341772152
8624194,5,B00GKP6ZWG,Never seen a film like it before! It's fast paced and very creepy. It has a fun indie feel to it and they make it work just right. I am going to get the DVD itself because I'm curious to see how they made the film in the special features. This film really makes you think in ways you didn't before. My grade would be an A-.,1395792000,,323,3.8358208955223883
8624195,1,B00GKP6ZWG,"The blurb on my hotel room movie rental screen looked like it could be a fun movie. The concept is brilliant but the execution is soooo bad I couldn't watch it, and I Like bad movies. I get the feeling they were trying for that ultimate B movie cult classic status, but instead ended up with muddled, uninspired garbage. If it turns up on Amazon Prime or Netflix you can watch the first ten minutes and see for yourself, but whatever you do don't waste your money buying it. Updated: if I could give it negative stars I would because apparently it attracts really stupid people to defend it.",1395014400,2,591,4.431192660550459
