8262756,5,B0016K670K,"In honor of this collection's 10th anniversary, even though they're all in the Disney Vault now, here's a review of a rare 7-in-1 set of the first 7 volumes of Walt Disney's Classic Cartoon Favorites on Disney DVD. Volumes 1 to 4 respectively star Mickey, Donald, Goofy, and Chip 'n' Dale, as volumes 5 to 7 are centered on Sports, Music, and Adventures, in that order, all in hour+-long discs, not counting commercials. That's 56 shorts in all, including How To Dance being in volumes 3 AND 6! Either individually or in this rare set, these DVDs are worthy of being in any family's home video collection; most of the shorts are restored prints seen in the Treasures tins, and (almost) all of them uncut; the only example of an edited short is Bee at the Beach in volume 2, Heaven knows why it wasn't uncut here nor did anyone mention to fix the boo-boo in Disney's replacement disc program. The first 4 volumes are the very first Disney DVDs I ever got and owned, no fooling! Sadly, there's never been a set containing all 12 volumes in 1 box, so I'll get to volumes 8 to 12 another time. To give you a better idea of how old and renowned these classic shorts are, they range from 1935 to 1954 in this whole collection, the exceptions being The Small One and Mickey's Christmas Carol from 1978 and '83 in volume 9. Later on in 2005 came a standalone disc called Vintage Mickey, containing 9 of his greatest black-and-white shorts, volumes 8 and 9 of this collection here, and volumes 1 and 2 of the Timeless Tales collection, which centered on classic stories from LONG ago. Volume 1 stars Mickey in 7 of his best-known shorts, mostly from his and Minnie's dot-eyes years in the 1930's. Volume 2 stars Donald in 8 more beloved classics, including then-unrestored prints of Inferior Decorator and Bee at the Beach before being in a later Treasures tin. Volume 3 stars Goofy in 9 of his own beloved classics, all restored Treasures prints, as volume 4 stars Chip 'n' Dale in 9 of their own classics, all UNrestored prints before most of them went into Treasures tins, and all 3 of their solo shorts are hard to find now, especially The Lone Chipmunks which isn't in this disc. Volume 5 (Extreme Sports Fun) is all about 8 sports shorts including Goofy's Oscar-nominated football game called How To Play Football. Volume 6 (Extreme Music Fun) is all about 8 musical shorts including the Oscar-nominated Latin-American classic Pluto's Blue Note, and the highly-controversial-AND-popular Silly Symphony short Woodland Caf. Volume 7 (Extreme Adventure Fun) is all about 8 adventurous shorts in the great outdoors, including the Oscar-nominated campout with Donald and his nephews titled Good Scouts. All 7 volumes in this set contain commercials at the very beginning via Fastplay, especially for the Platinum Edition VHS/DVD release of Cinderella. All 12 volumes have bonus commercials via Sneak Peeks if you wanna see them for yourself. It's gonna be a tough job finding each volume brand-new AND cheap, since this whole collection is in the Disney Vault. If only Disney would make new collections like this for DVD and Blu-ray, most people who remember these shorts would buy them in no time flat, aside from store lines or online traffic backups. Only time will tell if I'm right about this. If you already have these discs in this set or individually, just be thankful for what you already have, since Disney doesn't seem to listen to their fans about collections like this anymore, even with social media! As Donald would say on the matter, ""Aw, phooey!""",1424131200,,3555,4.763371150729336
