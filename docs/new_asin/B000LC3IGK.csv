My opinion on this is I wouldn't even give it one star unless I had to.  As someone who has danced, worked out, stepped, etc, for many years I am always on the look out for a new dance cardio routine.  My library of workouts starts with a Joanie Greggins LP, and ends up with Bluray. So I'm going to help someone save a little bit of money here.
The instructions are either overly slow and detailed, to non existent.  You will laboriously learn a sequence only to find out you won't use it at all. The steps you do learn are not taught in any kind of logical order.  She sometimes repeats a sequence twice, the next time once. There is no learning this.  And as far as being 45 minutes of aerobics, that's a down right lie.  Good luck even getting your heart rate up on this.  There's a lot of people that should stick to their day jobs and she's one of them.
If you want a really good step or dance routine, get some Petra Kolber, Gin Miller, or Prevention's dance series.  Even 10 Minute Solution workouts are better than this. The only other workout I can compare this to is Tracy Anderson""s ""Method""  another time I should have skipped the middle man and thrown my money down the toilet",1442880000,,1271,4.2190082644628095
8161545,5,B000LC3IGK,"This workout may not have very ""complicated dance steps"" (I thought they were challenging enough) but it is an all-around great workout. You will FEEL it before she gets to the cool-down. Great leg work and upper body. Highly recommended for anyone who's into ""dance""-type cardio. Very fun.",1217462400,,290,5.0625
8161546,1,B000LC3IGK,"So, I tried really hard to like this workout since I think that the Elle Glam Fitness Toning workout is relatively good. First of all, the warm up lasts for 10 minutes of the toal 50 minutes of the DVD. The actual cardio section is neither well cued nor exciting. It lasts for approximately 35 minutes. It felt as if the instructor was developing the moves as the workout was being filmed! Also, I wore my heart rate monitor and I very rarely got into my training zone. I added a lot of movement (i.e plyometrics) to make myself feel like I worked out at all. I would skip this workout, even for light days!",1210032000,,607,4.28695652173913
8161547,5,B000LC3IGK,"The dvd was great. I am not one to go to the gym and take classes b/c I don't feel comfortable working out in front of people, more or less dancing. I liked it. Im not a good dancer so it was easy for follow and have fun shakin' my butt. My 5yr daughter and I have fun doing it together. We always have a good laugh and feel great afterward. I have even noticed my body change and I lost a few inches off my waistline. I hope they do more dance videos that are this easy to follow and keep my daughter and I motivated to stay in shape.",1177459200,,535,3.828828828828829
8161548,5,B000LC3IGK,I thought the dvd was great. It is really easy to follow. I buy a lot of dance workout dvd's and like it when they don't spend a lot of time on the steps. The instructor just pushes through the workout and I don't get lost. I am very athletic and run a lot. This workout made me use and loosen up body parts that are usually stiff. I use it on my days that I don't run to keep balanced but still move. The workout tailors toward a dancer's body.. so it is nice to do something a little more toward looking like a supermodel and not a muscle chic. I think its perfect for people who want to get some cardio using the entire body and still want to look feminine doing it. Add it to the collection.. It will be worth it!,1177372800,,717,3.9517241379310346
8161549,1,B000LC3IGK,"I bought this wanting a good cardio dance workout, it fell short. This DVD has it's good points and its bad points, more bad than good unfortunately.

First the good:

- good instructor, happy/perky but not annoying. Her cueing is pretty easy to follow and she doesn't surprise you with changing direction without notice.

- tries to get your whole body with hip pops, lots of arm movements.

Now the bad:

- really strange music, not the kind that makes you want to dance.

- the modified version isn't really modified, and they hardly show her, instead they focus on another woman just about as much as they focus on the instructor. (there are 3 women + instructor).

- Several of the moves were difficult on carpet (funky feet, scissors).

- Some of the movements hard to follow.

Not a strenuous cardio routine, maybe good for an off day.",1175472000,3,842,4.597315436241611
8161550,1,B000LC3IGK,"This DVD claims to have 45 minutes of ""complete cardio"".  Instead, there are 45 minutes of warmup consisting almost entirely of step-touch and grapevine moves.  It is completely low impact and will never get your heart rate up.  Unless you are morbidly obese or get winded walking a half block at a normal pace, there is no benefit to this video.",1172620800,9,346,4.639344262295082
