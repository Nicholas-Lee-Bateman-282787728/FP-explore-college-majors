2815436,4,B000PC6YUI,"I absolutely loved this series, but I'm so disappointed that everything is still up in the air at the end of Series 3? Is that all there is?? I can't find a Series 4 anywhere, and I can't believe it just ends like this.",1212278400,6,219,4.0
2815437,5,B000PC6YUI,"""The House of Elliot""  is one of the best series I have. The story is in the 20's-30's with all the problems of women getting started in business, with women not being trained for jobs. I loved the acting, the story lines, the settings and the connection of family.  I have purchased 3 of these ""complete collections"" for family and friends.  I would purchase this collection again in a second.  I will  watch it over several times I am sure.

2815438,4,B000PC6YUI,"As other people have commented, it is a superb series.  My one complaint is the packaging.  The case is made of brittle plastic, and by the time I received the package the case was cracked and chipped off in more than one places.  I need to watch all the DVDs to find out if any of them are damaged as a result.  Each plastic board holds two disks back-to-back, and those center buttons that you must push to let the disk come off the board don't work very well.  Every time I take a disk off the holding board, I am really afraid that I may crack the disk!",1199664000,7,557,4.073394495412844

2815440,5,B000PC6YUI,"I absolutely loved the entire series of The House of Elliot.  I'm an all American who really enjoyed this British BBC series.  Anyone who loves the 1920's, it's history, will be sure to like the two sister characters trying to succeed in the fashion world of high couture.  Their small but lovely gem of a business is really quite inspiring.  I loved how smart, how strong, yet vulnerable at times these two women are.  Every episode is like looking through a glossy Vogue magazine, but with a good story.  You can't help but become fond of the working class cloth beaders, seamstresses, and cutter who all work for The House of Elliot.  There is something here for everyone. There is no vulgarity here, not to say that everyone is behaving well. Yes, there are hints and gossip of risque behavior.  We watch the occasional love story develop and unfold within some of the characters.  I'd be totally comfortable having my 11 year old daughter watching this with me.  Why can't they make more of this great stuff!",1193097600,123,1013,4.672316384180791

2815442,5,B000PC6YUI,"House of Eliott, all three seasons in one!

I bought the series one by one as they came out, I could not wait for the next one to come out. Also when I loan out my DVD's this series is always repeatedly borrowed. It is good enough to buy the whole series in one, that is for sure.

I love a story with strong yet feminine female characters. Stella Gonet and Louise Lombard play the differing roles superbly. The series is simply 'beautiful' to watch, with the set designs and fashionable clothing always unique and eye catching.

To top this all off, I liked the characters and was interested in where their lives were headed. This set is sure to please.",1187913600,74,654,4.3884297520661155

It simply stops. My advice; spend your money on something that will give you a sense of completion and not frustration. It's too bad it ""ended"" because the potential was amazing.",1479340800,,420,5.014285714285714

When I pay this much for a collection, I expect excellent quality, which I did not receive. Also the music is so loud, particularly because I have to turn the volume all the way on to hear the dialogue. Very disappointed!!!",1479081600,,383,4.408450704225352

When the show first aired on PBS I watched every episode and had been trying since then to find it recorded.  I am also a huge fan, like many, of Downton Abbey.  This series will for a short time satisfy my costume drama desires.  My plan is to binge watch it when I have enough time.",1474416000,,383,3.935064935064935

Rating is based on House of Eliott Complete Collection (Reissue) issued November 5, 2013.  Picture quality is noticeably inferior to House of Elliot Complete Collection issued on August 14, 2007.

For instance, the 2007 Series One has three episodes on four DVDs, the 2013 Series One has four episodes on three DVDs.  Perhaps this is a factor.  You have to make a choice, 2007 edition looks good but has no subtitles (dialog sometimes not well recorded overall), 2013 reissue has subtitles but image is washed out throughout!",1463529600,2,731,6.572916666666667

2815664,5,B000PC6YUI,"What a delight!! One of those series you will miss and reminisce about. My husband and I blasted through the entire series over the course of a few weeks, so we saw the story line evolve in a compressed manner. One thing that never ceased to delight was the fashion, from the collections the House of Eliott designed to what they wore themselves. This series also examines the lives along various social strata; you see the struggles of the everyday working person of the 1920s to the middle class and the aristocrats. Hated to see this end; it does however end on a note that allows the viewer to pencil in their own ideas for how things might unfold.

It was only after I had gotten online that I found out that the series had been cancelled after the Third year. That left the story incomplete as far as I was concerned. Series IV was not aired. I would love to have the fourth set and not have to draw my own conclusions of how all the characters ended up.

The overall plot is pretty average, the writing at times is absurd, and the acting, is not as good as some other British exports. In the end, you just want them to go away, and mercifully, the series was terminated by the producers before a reasonable ending was shown. Did it entertain? Yes.  Was it believable?

I watched this series years ago and always remembered liking the costumes in particular and the main characters.  (I was lucky to see Stella Gonet on stage in London a couple of years ago!)
It is one of those series that the BBC chose not to continue and some how did not wrap up at least some of the story lines - not only for the main ""Upstairs"" characters, but also for the ""Downstairs"" characters.",1425427200,,728,4.458646616541353

The furniture, and the building of course along with the grounds was outstanding.  I returned the film after watching only part of the first season.

This show is filled with strong women. I would call it a feminist drama. I would also classify it as a gentle drama especially as far as language. There are villains you will love to hate; the stories/plots are interesting. The only drawback to watching these episodes on DVD is the lengthy plot summary you have to navigate through to get to the episode.

2815756,2,B000PC6YUI,"After coming across Season 1 at my local library, I was hooked.  Unfortunately, my love soon faded.  Why did Evie become such a disagreeable, unlikeable, unsympathetic person?  The fact that the series just ended was horrible. At least, wrap up story lines.  What happens to Tillie and Norman?  Does Madge ever get a divorce?  Do Bea and Jack REALLY stay together?  What of the woman who sold them out to Grace and Mr. Cutter?  They spoke of a new vondeuse in season 2, yet we do not even see her until the last episode or two. Very inconsistent.  Evie started out as stylish but ended up looking more like she bought her clothes at Walmart.  What a waste of time.",1409443200,10,664,4.458333333333333

2815773,5,B000PC6YUI,"I have designed my clothing for years and also owned a window covering business where I spent endless hours in drapery workrooms working with seamstresses in order to come up with a beautiful finished product.  The detail and intricacy of any design-with-fabric business is both time consuming and very fulfilling.  This movie took me back into the world of fabrics and designs.  The clothing worn by both lead actresses was stunning.  When they showed their seasonal lines to their clients, I could not take my eyes off the fashions.  I can see why this series won awards for fashion design.  Fashions during the 1920's had a lot of bead work, usually done by hand.  You don't see that work any longer and it was a joy to behold during this series.

I also loved the language.  It was so nice to not hear slang and harsh words like we hear on our TV today.  Yes, people got angry and upset, but their vocal expressions were so much more palatable then what you see today.  My last comment is that this series is primarily for women.  I fully intend to watch it for many, many years to come.",1399248000,47,1091,4.482233502538071

2815813,5,B000PC6YUI,"Stellar in flapper costume elegance. The main plot of the 3 year series is two sisters bucking the system and beginning a lifetime of high society women's fashion. A 1920s rags to riches adventure (which alas did end suddenly like the stock market of the time.) Why did BBC every cancel?
The good news, it's back in this new packaging and
SUBTITLES,
yes, SDH SUBTITLES are NOW included.

The sets and props are as period perfect and breathtaking as the gowns the sisters create. And it is an advantage to have two beautiful lead roles played by Stella Gonet (Holby City) and Louise Lombard (CSI) to fill the sisters' act.
Episode plots keep the romance and action perking right along. There is never a dull moment in the 34 episodes. It's almost 30 hours of viewing London from the high society, low-brow, in-shop, street, and dark sides of clothing marketing as well as love lives both working and gone awry. The only negative I can offer is the fact that this Emmy and BAFTA award-winning series came to an end long before the public was ready. Again, Why?

The series was created from the lady team that also was responsible for ""Upstairs, Downstairs""--Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, stars in their own right in front of the camera.
Because this series is PERIOD COSTUME DRAMA, it never seems dated. It's stuck in the 1920s, and marvelously so.
This is a series must for British period lovers, and who isn't these days. I keep my set on the shelf, HANDY-LIKE, right beside my personal copy series of Downton Abbey. Yes, to me, they are comparable.

2815834,5,B000PC6YUI,"...albeit, an ""open-ended-ending"", which does suggest possible futures of the characters.

The ""House of Eliott"" 3-year, 20-episode series was created by Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, the two actress friends who created/wrote ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Perhaps there might have been plans to produce a sequel in the same way one was produced for ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" which showed how the people and Eaton Place fared 25 years on from the original family and events.
Both women are currently 78, so perhaps they are more interested in spending their time relaxing rather than writing more for ""HofE"". (Both women have received Honors from The Queen: Jean, the OBE, and Eileen, both the CBE and the DBE.)

2815837,2,B000PC6YUI,"Such a hit & miss! While this series holds appeal on many levels; high fashion, female emancipation, and sexual intrigue, it's fatally flawed.  The character of Beatrice is soon nothing more than a one dimensional whinging narcissist.  One small but obvious example: Having just given birth to a healthy baby, she manipulates comfort from the grieving and depressed Tilly, whose own baby has just died.

Evangeline, while more sympathetic, hardly fares better.  Other than treating staff members decently, she does nothing to demonstrate emotional evolution, but merely engages in a series of self-indulgent affairs with inappropriate men.  Beyond growing up, the character remains a stranger to the audience by sheer of lack of interest.  Yes, she's an artist dedicated to her craft.  Is she interesting or likable enough to invite into your home for an evening?  Hardly.

New characters with cliched, overly-dramatic circumstances are introduced into the story line and then uninterestingly & neatly wrapped up and shipped out.  Usually without any meaningful point.  And when they go, who cares?

This series had the potential to be great.  Too bad it was sold as a frothy, silly, melodramatic soap opera.  ""Ooooh Jack!""",1341273600,7,1223,5.302083333333333

2815844,3,B000PC6YUI,"My family and I greatly enjoyed the HoE when it first came out 20 years ago; after our Amazon purchase; we looked forward to being able to repeat the experience,  We decided (perhaps rashly) to view the entire set of about 30 episodes over a period of a week, three or four per evening.

Our impressions were mixed.  Top marks go for the camera work and the obvious pains that were taken with the costumes and the old cars.  However we did notice that it was usually the same taxi that drew up to deposit or receive the visitors to the HoE.

The heavy dose of HoE brought certain things to our attention.  One of them was the event-crammed script; obviously designed to hold a grip on the viewers during the week that elapsed between one epidode and the next. There were innumerable sub-plots and characters who strutted the stage for a few episodes and were then summarily removed by death or disgrace or both.  The Sebastian character was good and so was the astute old financier ""Sir Desmond"", but out they went.

Accents? Hmmm.

Those who listen to old records of the 1920s or watch sound movies from that era, will know that the upper class accent was very very different from the broad cockney London accent.  Today most people in the London area have an accent (Estuary English) which is neither one thing nor the other.  Louise Lombard's Estuary accent would have raised eyebrows in the polite society of the 1920s and ""Evangeline"" would have been obliged to take elocution lessons if the HoE was to remain in respectable business.

Stella Gonet's accent might have passed muster 90 years ago, but there were some oddities that kept cropping up, for example her pronunciation of ""appreciate"".  According to general practice (and the Oxford English Dictionary) the c in that word is sounded as ""-ch-"".  Persistently Ms. Gonet pronounced the word as ""appreessiate"".  This would hardly have been noticeable to the viewer of a single episode, but it grated quite a bit when the whole set of episodes was viewed over a week.

Our advice to would-be purchasers of HoE is the same as the doctor's advice on prescription drugs: take the pills one at a time rather than swallowing them all at once.  When we get around to watching HoE again, we'll follow that advice.",1316304000,3,2266,4.681818181818182

First of all we absolutely loved this series. It is addictive. The period costumes, manners, sets were all top notch. The actors did an incredible job and you always felt like you were really there with them. However, the reason I am giving this a 3 instead of a 5 is because there is no ending. Now this wasn't the fault of the people involved with making the show but apparently BBC pulled the plug at the end of series 3. Since the writers had no idea this was going to happen, the season finale of series 3 is full of cliff hangers, including the prospect of the Eliott sisters going against each other for real. For me there is nothing more frustrating than purchasing an expensive box set without any knowledge that the show doesnt really end. If I researched it better I would have passed on this as I feel duped. Still it is a wonderfully produced period drama and anyone would enjoy it.

We were totally engrossed in the series and in the lives of all of the characters in the story. Each character totally suited his or her role- great casting. I can't recommend it enough but there is one major flaw in the series in that it ends abruptly leaving you hanging and feeling that there should be a lot more to come. I read the book The House at War about the Eliot sisters during WW11 so it is evident that there was more to come. We absolutely hated to have it end especially such an abrupt ending. I intend to purchase the set as it is definitely worth watching over again.,1295568000,4,671,4.1692307692307695

2815852,4,B000PC6YUI,"The House of Elliot revolves around the lives of the Elliot sisters in 1920's England and their struggle to make their own way in the world after the sudden death of their domineering father. They put their skills at clothing design to good use and gradually start up their own successful fashion house. The series focusses on the differences between the lives of the upper middle-class Elliot sisters and the working-class women in their employ, as well as the wealthy upper-class clients they routinely deal with. As the series progresses through the 20's many historical events are touched on, including the General Strike, issues with shell-shocked ex-servicemen from the Great War, the rise of the Labour Party etc.

The highlight of the series are of course the fashions. The clothing is beautiful, flawlessly reproduced, and extremely striking. It's worth getting the entire series just to see the clothes!
All the actors are highly competent at their craft and put in fine performances, without exception.

Where the series fails however is the writing. Plot points are routinely signposted miles in advance, the drama is repetitive and almost always relies on the main characters having a misunderstanding about something they accidentally failed to communicate about earlier on in an episode (hence the signposting). Various sub-plots often peter out into nothing (as if the writers were bored with them), and frequently important antagonist characters (and others) just conveniently ""go away"", never to be seen or refereed to again. Early on in the series it suffered from the writers being far too obvious about dealing with the issues of the day ""oh isn't it hard fining a job as a women in the 1920's, it's just not fair', that sort of thing. Another failing of the early series  were the too obvious ""villain"" characters (their cousin and his aunt, and later Ralph Seroyan, the evil banker). In later episodes things mature a little and the drama is drawn from their business and their social lives, but becomes steadily more melodramatic and soapy as things go on.

All in all The House of Elliot is quite a good series with high production values and excellent acting, slightly let down by poor writing. It's a flawed gem.",1289606400,9,2239,5.026954177897574

The presentation of two young sisters suddenly forced to fend for themselves at a time in history when women with ambition were a quaint oddity is a much appreciated escape from the current crime series that flood TV.  I an the first-born girl with a younger, prettier and more talented sister who was also my closest and well-loved friend.  In our early years circumstances isolated us from outside experiences, so this was really my kind of show.  It was engrossing to watch the girls'  tentative first steps into the real world, and how their hard work, persistence, patience and creativity developed and gave them confidence that they could not only survive, but succeed.  Two marvelous actresses surrounded by a strong supporting cast including several handsome young men, made for hours of enjoyable viewing.  And, oh my dear, the costumes!

Beautiful fabrics and great design. That in itself will take up 60 percent of your budget. I loved this series and I revisit ""The House of Eliott"" once a year. I just love those clothes. This series was also educational because I was not aware that the ""ready to wear"" was created during the 20's. Also the fashion industry is a cut throat businesss. Where can I get my hands on some 20's fashions? We dress so primitive today with our shorts and t-shirts.",1262563200,5,626,4.358974358974359
2815861,4,B000PC6YUI,"The House of Elliot is an enjoyable series about two sisters who were basically disenfranchised from their father after his death, who needed to rise out of poverty and disgrace, and found it in the world of fashion.  The younger sister, Evangeline has a serious eye for fashion, and the savvy and talent to make it into a career, with help and guidance from her older sister Beatrice.

I am a fan of period dramas, so I was interested in this series.  It's set in the 20th century and reflects the age of flappers, professional photographers, and aeroplanes.  It also features a few cads and scoundrels who try to take advantage of the disgraceful state the girl's father left them in, by giving money to unknown relatives rather than providing for them.

Thankfully, the sisters are up to the task of making it on their own.  After a few fits and starts learning the ropes of the fashion design industry, the girls try to make it on their own.  With the moral and financial support of a neighbor, the always-smiling and always sunny Jack Maddox (the photographer, who gives Beatrice her first job) and Evangeline's godfather Sir Desmond Gillespie, the two finally scrape together enough money to open their own custom fashion design house, able to imagine, create, sew and sell haute couture fashions to the rich and famous females of London.

Several other memorable characters appear through out the series, including aunt Lydia, her father's sister, aunt Lydia's rather disreputable son, attorney Arthur, and Jack Maddox's rather tedious do-gooder Penelope Maddox.

Recommended.  This is a fun series that is entertaining and doesn't bog down.  There are a few surprises along the way, but the girls are never in any terrible danger, and provide good and wholesome entertainment.",1262476800,5,1784,4.953020134228188
2815862,5,B000PC6YUI,"I just watched this series over the past week as I was home sick with a really bad flu and it was the only thing that got me through.  No matter how awful I felt, I continually enjoyed each segment of The House of Elliot.

The spunk of the two sisters that set them off in the design world slowly grew to mature confidence.  The characters were all well developed.  The vicissitudes of life were realistic, no melodrama beyond how we humans tend to act and react.

Even those characters who were somewhat snakes in the grass, or maybe just a general pain in the derriere, had their vulnerable side fleshed out, which caused me to feel sympathy rather than just pure dislike.

Definitely a series I will watch again and share with friends.  Worth the price.  Don't hesitate to add this to your BBC library.",1260835200,6,805,4.465753424657534

Purchasing this series (the complete collection) is worth the price, if for no other reason than to admire the fabulous clothing and accessories of the Eliott sisters.  I always had the misconception that the 1920s flapper decade was void of elegant fashion until I watched this series.  How could I have been so wrong?",1260489600,5,491,5.337662337662338
2815864,5,B000PC6YUI,"an excellent series, very well acted and well worth the time to sit and watch. this series realy needs a second viewing to get a real grasp of the whole story.",1259971200,3,159,4.161290322580645
2815865,3,B000PC6YUI,"*SPOILER ALERT AHEAD!*

The story line itself was rather formulaic, two young women who were denied an education by their tight fisted, philandering father, struggled to make a name for themselves in the fashion industry.  The attention to detail on set and especially w/the clothing was exact and the actresses wore their clothing well.  Each is beautiful in their own way; neither, however, is outstanding as an actress.

I think that part of the problem is in viewing several episodes in one sitting.  That's when you can see all the flaws that become difficult to overlook, such as Evie working at her drawing board, becoming frustrated and crumpling the paper and throwing it on the floor or having words w/sister Bea and shouting in anger, storming out of the room and then taking two steps, turning around and saying ""I'm sorry"".  After a while, it became monotonous.

As for the ending, it didn't leave me hanging as others have stated.  Bea and Jack were married and Jack had won a seat in Parliament.  Evie decided to stay in England to fight progress w/in the company rather than join her husband in Paris, so he, too, decided to stay by her side in England.  The only characters whose futures were undecided were Tillie and her husband.  Tillie left the House of Eliott to take a position as companion to an elderly disabled woman and her husband was to be the chauffeur and all around helper but those jobs fell through.  That's life.  Not everything turns out the way we want it to.  However, given that Tillie had been a loyal employee in the House of Eliott from the beginning, had the series continued, doubtless she would've been rehired and her husband would've been hired as the driver for the company.

I seriously thought that the story line would develop that Evie would confess that she was a lesbian.  Each episode saw her becoming increasingly masculine, although beautiful and stunning in her new creations.  She even walked like a man w/her hands down at her side in a half fist.  Combined w/her football calves and her interest in a lesbian couple that was dancing in a club, it would've been the perfect opportunity to see where that story line would go.  By the end of the series, she looked more like a man than a woman.

I liked the House of Eliott but it just isn't 5 star worthy.",1259280000,8,2314,4.638820638820639

On the down side, the plastic casing which contained the DVDs was brittle and did not hold them securely.  Plastic chips had broken away in the shipping process and I was initially concerned that these had damaged or scratched the DVDs.

Set during the Roaring 20s in London, the Eliott sisters suddenly find themselves hard on their luck and in their search for work, decide that their dream is to start their own fashion house.  It does not prove an easy venture, and I was constantly surprised by the difficult blows they receive around every corner.  The characters are all well-developed, colorful, and real, and every aspect of the production is superb. Stella Gonet and Louise Lombard are wonderful as Beatrice and Evangeline Eliott, and Aden Gilett is handsome and winning as Jack Maddox.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat, with dramatic cliffhangers that have you dashing to put in the next DVD to see what happens.  And the costumes, as they should be, are AMAZING!  It won an Emmy for costumes because it captures the style of the period (and makes me hope for flapper fashion to come back in style!).

The historical context of England in the 20s, the emotionally engaging struggles of the two girls to succeed in their own fashion business, the well-written plots, and especially, the magnificent 20s costumes all contribute to making this series a delight on many levels. Highly recommended!",1248566400,,423,4.971830985915493
2815873,5,B000PC6YUI,"This complete collection of ""The HOUSE of ELIOTT"" has 34 episodes, 1770 minutes, approximately the same amount of superb entertainment as 20 full-length films.  It is as much a bargain as it is a beautifully filmed British drama about the London fashion industry.  From seamstress to industry giants, you meet and learn to love or hate all the people that work and create exclusive fashions.

It is a delight.  Bea and Evie, the beautiful, unwed Eliott sisters, become the viewer's family. Splendid acting causes one to run the gambit of emotion as Bea and Evie struggle and succeed, over and over, first one-then the other, through a decade of trying to rise above the odds.  Being sheltered and uneducated, the two find themselves in the early 1920's without means, an exhausted estate, and only sewing skills in place of an education.  It was society's way.

Through the episodes, they both face the hard road to finding love.  They both face the hard road to financial success.  A fantastic story of ladies taking on the world, usi8ng beauty, talent, and intellect--AND WINNING.  Unsurpassed 20s costuming and sets.  Experience NOT the Roaring Twenties, but the Sensual Twenties.

34 episodes pass much too quickly, leaving one with the desire for more. The Eliott family is done, the episodes are completed, and there is nothing we can do about our own loss--EXCEPT--return to disc one and start again.  It's that good.

A very interesting extra is a 2005 interview with Louise Lombard (CSI) who played Evie Eliott. She recalls show moments, while at interview time is only 4 days from delivery of a baby.  Lombard was also in ""The Black Velvet Gown"" a film made from the book by Catherine Cookson. Any Cookson movie is recommended.

This DVD set gives viewers a very early look at Minnie Driver (Good Will Hunting, Circle of Friends).  She was cast as the second receptionist in Jack's photo studio.

This is a first-rate series as proven by its presentation on the BBC, A&E, PBS, BBC America, plus receiving costume design awards, Emmy, and a BAFTA.",1244419200,4,2056,4.876080691642652
2815874,5,B000PC6YUI,"""The House of Eliott"" is a lavish and lush treat for anyone who loves the beautifully detailed BBC costume dramas traditionally showcased on ""Masterpiece Theater"" or (of late) on the A&E channel. I've never been able to figure out why the Brits do this sort of thing so consistently well, but American producers attempting the same thing more often fall flat. Attention to detail, I think... or a total willingness to put the acting company in costumes and hairdos that may look distinctly odd, or unattractive to conventional modern eyes.

This  three-season long series aired originally from 1991-1994 and follows the fortunes of the Eliott sisters,  Beatrice  ""Bea"", (Stella Gonet) and Evangeline ""Evie""  (Louise Lombard) who are left apparently impoverished by sudden death of their domineering father early in 1920s London. Bea is thirty-year old spinster who has raised her seventeen-year old sister after the death of their mother. Neither of them have any professional training, only the usual education  thought fit for a middle-class woman of the time,  no prospects for marriage... and no money.

But Bea has the experience of running a household, and Evie is a skilled amateur artist... and they are accustomed to making their own clothes. They are fiercely determined to be independent, to have successful lives on their own... and with the aid of a circle of friends they are able to establish a small couture firm; the ""House of Elliot"". The series follows the sisters' business and personal ups and downs, and those of their circle of friends and employees. Bea and Evie clash with each other, over what they want to focus on with their business, just as often as they agree. It's soap-opera-ish but briskly paced. The details of period fashion are exquisite and fascinating, as the sisters very gradually develop confidence and style of their own, moving from dowdy post-war styles that seem a hangover from the age of Victoria, to very chic, jewel-colored clothes befitting the owners of a notable haute couture house.

So much of our current culture landscape was just coming into flower in the 1920s. Mass entertainment like the movies, radio and recorded music, the retail fashion trade, telephones and commercial air transport, the near-universal utility of automobiles, and women pursuing independent careers and balancing that with a family life. The world of the Eliott sisters looks just enough like ours to be familiar... but just different enough to be intriguing. But one absolutely timeless, brief scene of an elegant Evie Eliott, in high heels and a knee-length skirt, sashaying briskly  along a London sidewalk is a reminder of  how swiftly expectations of what a woman should be, and those that a woman had of herself had changed  in a bare two decades.

My one criticism is that the third series seems oddly truncated, as if the story arc just abruptly ended in mid-point. There were set-ups and situations in the last two episodes that were just left dangling, as if the plug was pulled before the writers could tie them all together with one satisfactory conclusion, or as if there was supposed to be one more season, to carry the story to a logical conclusion... say, with the beginning of the Depression that put paid to the  flamboyant and glittering decade of the 1920s.

The ""bonus"" extras are hidden away on the first disc of each series: stills of the cast of each season, and of various movie and television credits. There is a recent interview with Louise Lombard, and a brief and rather disappointing feature on fashion of the 1920ies which would have been much improved with stills of the various costumes actually used in the series. And do not miss a Minnie Driver in a bit-part in episode 4 of the first season. All in all, the series is as rich and as lavish a treat as one of the Eliott sisters ensemble collections.",1243900800,5,3868,4.9201228878648235

It's sad that American television series are so contrived and trivial in comparison. Our only disappointment was that we wanted more.  The last episode seemed to cut the story mid-stream leaving us frustrated, wanting to know how the several crisis situations resolved themselves.  So, if you need a tidy ending, forget it.  If you want to see what a quality production looks like, this is the gold standard.",1233964800,6,546,5.078651685393258
2815876,5,B000PC6YUI,"The entire series of The House of Elliott is a sheer delight, especially to any lovers of fashion and the art deco era. Two sisters who had been raised as members of a priveleged class, find themselves penniless after the death of their profligate father who has denied them an education which would enable them to make their own way in the world. Both are talented dressmakers and designers, used to making their own clothes and both have an inborn flair for style and cut. They establish one of the first English Haute Couture fashion houses at a time when it was thought that only the French were able to create fashion, and gradually set their own style which converts a large number of society women to becoming regular clients. The dressing in the show is superb, going from the immediate post WW1 days through to the middle thirties, and the details of furnishings, cars and houses are perfect.
