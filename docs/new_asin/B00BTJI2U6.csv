5672740,5,B00BTJI2U6,This is one of the best war movies you will ever see in your life! I have never seen so many tanks in a movie ever. Everything in this movie is of epic proportion!  It starts at Kursk and end in Berlin. This movie has some soviet propaganda but overall it is the best movie about the Eastern Front!  I can't say more about how a great movie this is.,1397260800,2,349,3.9714285714285715
5672741,4,B00BTJI2U6,"Tolstoy gave us ""War and Peace"". Kalinin gave us the K-7 Bomber aircraft. Antonov gave us the Ant-20 ""Maxim Gorky"" propaganda aircraft and the An-225 ""Mriya"" six-engined cargo aircraft*. And so it was that, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Soviet screenwriters Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov and directer Yuri Ozerov and co-director Julius Kun brought us the epic five-movie series ""Liberation"". This series tells the somewhat fictionalized story of the Soviet advance against the Nazi war machine through Europe from just after the Battle of Stalingrad to the fall of Berlin.

The first film (""The Fire Bulge"") showcases the battle of the Kursk salient, an epic tank battle that marked the end of German armor superiority.

The second film (""Breakthrough"") focuses on the Soviet offensive along the lower Dnieper river and highlights the arrest and rescue of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the liberation of Kiev, and the Tehran conference between Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill. (Needless to say; this being a Soviet-era war movie, Roosevelt is played as a bit of a glad-handing naf while Churchill is portrayed as a cynical opportunist.)

The third film (""Direction of the Main Blow"") is divided into two parts. Part I focuses on the advance through the swamps of Belarus toward the city of Bobruisk.and the attack by Belorussian and recently freed German anti-fascist partisans on Nazi-held railways. Part II focuses on Operation Bagration, the offensive against Bobruisk and the city of Minsk, while highlighting the effort by Claus von Stauffenberg and members of the German Army to assassinate Hitler (this is actually one of the best parts of the movie and I actually found it somewhat better done than Tom Cruise's ""Valkyrie"") and the Polish Army's crossing of the Bug river.

The fourth film (""The Battle of Berlin"") focuses on the Soviet advances on the Vistula and Oder rivers toward Berlin while highlighting secret efforts by the Nazis to negotiate with the Americans.

The final film (""The Final Assault"") focuses on the last days of Hitler, Eva Braun, and Joseph Goebbels and his family and the final push into the Reichstag building while highlighting the flooding of the U-Bahn (Berlin's subway system),

Much of the series is reasonably well acted and has a lot of the tropes that are found in war movies of the era. (Heroic Heroes, Villainous Villains -- although Stauffenberg and his comrades in the ""Valkyrie"" segment are a good deal more ambiguous, and sometimes even tragically cheer-worthy.) If you're a plastic scale modeler, as I am, you might even get a few good ideas for models and dioramas because there are quite a few tanks and other armored vehicles that aren't seen outside of black-and-white photographs that are presented in these movies in rather good color. (Except for the German tanks. For some reason they're all painted in something resembling an early-war Gray scheme.)

My main complaint about the series would probably be the music. It's a bit on the Euro-Modernist side with plenty of ""screaming"" atonal trumpets. Also; during a Victory sequence at the end of the fifth movie, they play a bit of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5; then interrupt it with Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor; and then resume the Beethoven. Why didn't they simply play the Beethoven without interruption? I can only guess that the editor (or the political guy in charge of the editorial department) must have had a bit too much vodka the night before.

Is this series worth owning? I'd say ""Yes"" if you're a big war movie fan and want to see how the other side treated the genre.

*Other nations have made very large aircraft too, but the early Soviet-era aircraft seem to have a certain ponderous ""something-between-Steampunk-and-Dieselpunk"" style to them; as if they were originally designed as semi-streamline trains, but had wings slapped on them at the last minute.",1393027200,3,3900,5.062305295950155
5672742,5,B00BTJI2U6,"Like others, I've waited many years for an English subtitled version of this epic and it is a magnificent piece of work which will amaze any student of the war on the Eastern Front.  To say it's not a Soviet propaganda piece, however, is pure nonsense, as the movie shows what a skewed version of the entire war that the Russians had, even in the late 1960's and early 1970's when this long series was made.  Roosevelt and especially Churchill are presented as scheming villains almost throughout the film, and credit for victory in every single battle in the West, from D-Day to the Ardennes, is given to Soviet troops because the desperate British and American forces sent dear ""Uncle Joe"" urgent letters for help asking for major offensive drives at those key times to bail them out of trouble and draw German soldiers away from the West.  Even at the end of the film, there's an unexpected backhanded commentary about the Western allies and how little they did to win the war - I was a bit surprised by that.

All that aside - BUY this film if you're a WWII history buff, you will be extraordinarily entertained.  I don't know how they did it, but they got six or seven hours of video on a single disc and it plays fine!  The movie is a semi-documentary sort of affair, with a lot of voice-overs and it skips around between three or four major characters.  The movie begins, interestingly, just before the battle of Kursk and continues to the fall of Berlin.  Every time they deal with major leaders, such as Stalin, Hitler, Churchill, etc., the film is in black-and-white, and when it clicks into the more movie-like portions, it's shot in color.  It was a bit annoying having it switch back and forth between color and black-and-white throughout and I don't understand why they did it that way, but, that's the way it is.

The major pros of this film are simple - the uniforms and equipment used are astonishing!  There are probably hundreds of T-34s in this production, along with running Stalin tanks, SU85 and SU152 assault guns, several original German half tracks, a large number of original artillery pieces from both sides, Opel Blitz trucks, Kubels, Studebaker 6x6's, and some of the best Tiger tank copies ever built for movie use.  Many of the German uniforms in this movie are originals that were held in Soviet stockpiles after the war, and toward the end you will see some extremely rare Waffen SS camo tunics and smocks being worn, along with one fellow in the fall of Berlin fighting who's wearing a legit SS ""Liebermuster"" camo tunic!  I couldn't help but wonder what became of all those rarities after this was filmed.

The scenes of the tanks in action alone is well worth the purchase price, as there is some fantastic footage of T-34s jumping over obstacles and running through buildings and street cars - literally!  Down side to this, most of the tank film work appears to have been done at a Soviet army base with a rather wide open expanse, as regardless of the battle involved - Kursk or the outskirts of Berlin, the terrain looks exactly the same - barren and wide-open with just scrubby trees and a few small ditches and creeks.  The Soviet aircraft used in the movie are all YAK 52 trainers, which is fine with me as they capture the overall look of WWII Soviet aircraft, but of course, have tricycle landing gear.

My only qualms with the film are the ones I expected - the grossly unrealistic behavior of Russian officers and troops.  In this film, every single one of them acts with extreme heroism and their kindness is beyond measure.  Every time they capture a German soldier they treat him kindly, offer him food and cigs, then cheerfully send him home (yeah, that happened a lot!).  The German women greet the Russian soldiers with cups of tea in Berlin and cheerfully engage them in their homes.  A tank commander accidentally smashes the front of a Berlin coffee shop, then he and his crew go find the owners to apologize, bring them food and drink, and they have a grand old time becoming friends in the basement.  The Russian soldiers save a priest from two German soldiers in Berlin and then put the priest on their radio urging Germans to surrender.  When the priest leaves and is just walking down the street (wearing full black-and-white flowing priest robes), for some reason, a German machine gunner shoots him to pieces.  German and Soviet soldiers join forces to work hand-in-hand in Berlin to save civilians in the subway tunnels, and on, and on, and on, it goes throughout the whole movie.  Every German soldier is a cruel butcher, every Russian soldier is brave, heroic, and pure as the driven snow.  Unrealistic?  Absolutely.  Expected?  Absolutely.  One must remember, this was made between 1968 and 1971 for a Soviet audience - how else would the government have portrayed the second world war?

This is an absolutely fantastic look at how the Soviets saw WWII - definitely through ""red"" colored glasses!  It is an epic with a capital ""E"" and was their effort to outdo the grand Western war movies of that day such as ""Battle of Britain,"" ""Patton,"" and ""The Longest Day.""  Is it historically accurate?  Not by a long shot.  Is it a fascinating movie with equipment we'll never see used again?  YES!  For that fact alone, and for the incredible amount of weapons and equipment seen throughout, I cannot recommend this one highly enough.  If you're a WWII buff, this one will dazzle you.  If you're a ""normal"" person, it'll probably bore you to sleep!

Get this one while you can - again, the armor scenes alone are well worth twice the price!",1389139200,7,5601,4.663951120162933
5672743,5,B00BTJI2U6,"Is ""Osvobozhdenie"" (""Liberation"") a masterpiece? Probably not. Is it worthy to stand alongside the ""Longest Day""'s, ""Bridge Too Far""'s, and ""Battle of the Bulge""'s? Easily. Why? Because it is one of a kind. Why ""one of a kind?"" This is the only series of movies, to my knowledge (as opposed to documentaries like ""The World at War""), which portrays a comparable period of War World II in Europe on such a vast scale. It goes from July 1943 (battle of the Kursk bulge) to the fall of Berlin in May 1945. The emphasis is, of course, on the eastern front, where most of fighting and dying was done, but even the Normandy landing is briefly treated, as well as the arrest of Mussolini and his subsequent rescue by the Nazis, Yugoslav partisan activity, etc. The actor portraying Mussolini speaks Italian, the actor portraying Churchill speaks English, the actor who plays Hitler speaks German, Poles speaks Polish, there is even a French pilot who is part of a volunteer brigade flying with the Soviet air force. He, of course, speaks the Gallic tongue. Needless to say, the Soviets speak Russian. As one who majored in French, studied German and Russian in college, and has lived and worked in Russia, I can vouch for the fact that the English subtitle translations, with the exception of a few misspellings (such as ""slop"" for ""stop"" on one occasion), are excellent. Only real problem is that a German general, for example, will begin speaking in German, then a Russian voice-over translation will begin and obliterate the German, so that if you don't understand Russian, you are dependent on the English subtitles, but as I said, they are excellent. I do wish, however, that they would release a version without the voiceovers, but this is probably too much to ask. As it is, the voiceovers themselves are excellent, as far as I can tell from the original languages being voiced over. And it is, in fact, sometimes possible to tell quite a lot in this respect.

  This, then, is a series of films which lovers of European languages can treasure, while they get a different perspective, the Soviet one, on the last two years of the war in Europe. The sound is excellent for movies made in the late 60s and 1970s. The picture quality is also good--it has been restored, but one needs to realize that ""complete restoration of picture and sound,"" to translate a commonly used phrase on Russian DVDs, does not necessarily mean Criterion Collection quality image and sound. There are some scenes where flickering black specks are visible on the films, which appear to have been shot in 70 mm, but this does not last long enough to be distracting. Others have commented on the panoramic aspects of the battle scenes, so I will simply add that both picture and audio quality are never less than satisfactory,and usually quite good. For a set which is selling for around fifteen dollars, this is an outstanding bargain.

  Last, but not least, I have found these six films (five, if you consider that the third film is a two-parter) to be intellectually stimulating. This series, very refreshingly, has a different point of view. Watching it, you find yourself wondering if that actually happened or if it happened the way it is portrayed as happening. There are real historical characters, as well as fictional characters that we follow throughout the series. Roosevelt is dealt with sympathetically, Churchill comes across as a devious rascal outwitted by Stalin. Hitler, of course, is portrayed as a madman, but even he, in the bunker, comes across as a broken old man, though still dangerous. It must be born in mind that, when these movies were made, East Germany was part of the Soviet empire, and these movies were to be shown there as elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain. Here there are a few scenes where conscious effort seems to have been made not to demonize the German civilian population. Indeed one scene shows a German minister being shot, presumably by Nazis, as he urges the German soldiers in Berlin to lay down their arms. The plot to kill Hitler in 1944 by von Stauffenberg is also given lengthy treatment.

  I have watched this complete series twice since its purchase a short time ago. For anyone with anything more than a completely closed mind, this set should be stimulating. It doesn't hurt that the director, Yuri Ozerov, was in the war himself. He encountered obstacles from the Soviet political and military establishment and delayed some filming until he could shot the films the way he thought they should be done. The acting, of course,from the international cast, will vary in a project of this scale. Mikhail Ulyanov makes a great Zhukov. Among the fictional characters, I confess that I fell in love with the Soviet actress Golubkina, who played the nurse Zoya. There's a scene where she's been swimming in a river. Her soldier friend and would-be lover watches her emerge from the water. We see only her naked feet as she comes out, then her head and shoulders above a blanket as she dries off--very tastefully done, and very effective. She's in the last scene of the last film, with many others, in front of the Reichstag, before the coda (using Beethoven and Bach as musical background) informs us how many people of each nationality died in the European theatre of the war. Highly recommended.",1377129600,28,5322,4.807650273224044
5672744,5,B00BTJI2U6,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for find some of the best war movies are foreign made as I like to see it from there viewpoint.  One doesn't need Hollywood actors because you feel the history jump right off the screen  as they use realistic period equipment people & sometimes maybe actual locations.,1375056000,12,300,4.75
5672745,5,B00BTJI2U6,"Why did it took so long, to be released with English subtitles. This series is basically an earlier version of Band of Brothers, the Soviet experience.
There is astonishingly little Soviet propaganda ""in your face"", Yuri Oserov was a great Director, who was able, to keep the soviet entertainment apparatshicks at distance. His honest and gritty style was very popular with the Russian audience.
Off course, do not expect the Warsaw incident, Katyn and so on be mentioned. Even if Yuri Oserov was aware of it in 1970, when he produced this series, he could not have included those incidents. Even in the saw period after Stalin, those topics remained taboo. There where 10'000's of Russian Soldiers utilized as extra's for the big battle scenes, and hundreds of tanks and airplanes. In the absence of CGI, a great
orchestration was necessary to put everything together, and who was the best man to do it? Yury Oserov. He deserves great praise for it. In the future such battle spectacles will be on par, with the many great battle paintings, we see and marvel at museums. For many resons, the  large variety of tanks, vehicles and weapons being displayed  are not authentic. We see Russian T-34/85 tanks in the movie, when we should have seen T-35/76 that where actually doing most at the fighting at Kursk. And so it goes on. But the viewers of the 70's probably didn't care about this detail. And it would be prohibitive budged-wise to see more than that.
The acting is great, and not only the best of the popular east european actors/actress have participate in this series, but some west european actors too.
Specially the French, who played the pilots of the Normandy-Njemen Squadron, fighting as volunteers for the Soviet airforce. Than there is Fritz Dietz, the east german actor, for one of the best portraits of Hitler. A very gifted artist.
He played Hitler in many other east european productions. Sort of typecasted.",1366156800,37,1928,4.857142857142857

5672754,4,B00BTJI2U6,"For my 700th review on Amazon -- yes, I have no life -- I wanted to do something special. Not just some run of the mill book or movie or product but something different, something special.

LIBERATION definitely qualifies.

I've seen a crap-ton of WW2 movies and mini-series over the years -- American, Canadian, British, Italian, German, Japanese, and even one Russian one (THE HOT SNOW). I wasn't prepared, however, for either the scope or the sweep of this Soviet-era epic, which chronicles the entire Eastern war from early '43 to the fall of Berlin in mid-'45, as seen both from the very top (Stalin, Zhukov, et al) to the very bottom (junior infantry officers, enlisted tank crewmen, a female medic, fighter pilots, etc.). Forget everything you think you know about ""big budget"" war films; even THE LONGEST DAY and A BRIDGE TOO FAR look a bit sickly when compared with this historical epic, which features not only a cast of thousands, but enough period military equipment to actually fight a minor war.

LIBERATION is divided up into six parts, which cover not only the Soviet point of view but also the German, and to a lesser extent the American, British, Italian, Polish, and Yugoslavian as well. Though there is not much room for personal moments, a few minor characters in the army and air force round out the parade of important historical figures. The episodes are:

The Fire Bulge - This is an utterly awe-inspiring look at the Battle of Kursk, i.e. the greatest tank duel of all time, from inception at German HQ to the burning fields of Prokarovka, where it came to a climax. The combat sequences are incredible, featuring brilliant cinematography and using hundreds of real tanks. There is a single take which goes on for some minutes featuring savage point-blank battles that resolve into vicious hand to hand fighting, occurring against a backdrop of tracer fire and explosions, that the viewer will never forget. But equally interesting is the high-level strategizing on the German and Russian sides.

Breakthrough - Another staggering episode shows the heavy price the Soviets had to pay to push the Germans back to the Dnepr River in late '43, and some of the ruthless tactics they employed, including diversionary attacks which condemned whole units to annihilation. This story also covers the progression of the war in other theaters and the rise of guerrilla movements.

Direction of the Main Blow Parts I & II -- An episode steeped in intrigue, this one takes place in the summer of '44. Stalin wants to drive the Germans from Soviet soil once and for all, but there is a great deal of argument among the Russians on how to do it, and among the Germans on how to stop it. Meanwhile, the plot of the generals against Hitler is hatched.

The Battle for Berlin -- A slightly deceptive title, this is actually about the Soviet push in late '44 - early '45, which brought the Red Army to the gates of Hitler's capital; also about Hitler's decline from a self-confident warlord to a jittery, paranoid, delusional dead man walking. Also about intrigue among the ""frenemies"" -- America, Britain and the USSR.

The Last Assault - A lavish episode, featuring a whole army of extras, shows in brutal (and occasionally humorous) detail the vicious fight for Berlin, which lasted only a week but cost the Soviets 300,000 casualties. A great deal of time is spent showing the fight for the Reichstag, and some of the street-fighting sequences are as spectacular as they are vicious.

LIBERATION was directed by Yuri Ozerov, and it must have sorely tested his skills as an organizer, because the scale of this series is massive. In ""The Fire Bulge"" we see battles waged with entire battalions of real tanks. In ""Breakthrough"" a massive-scale river crossing (under fire) is shot, as is the deployment of what looks to be a whole army of Germans in full regalia with Tigerpanzers and heavy guns. And in ""The Last Battle"" what seems like the entire Red Army brawls with the last, most fanatical remnants of the German in the cathedral-like Reichstag. Aside from big battle sequences, however, there are some really good depictions of Churchill -- quite rightly shown as a cold-blooded imperialist with a hidden agenda; Mussolini (when he is deposed in '43 by his own army, he snaps, ""This is the only successful operation of the General Staff!""), and Roosevelt (shown as an idealistic dreamer), as well as interesting depictions of guerrilla warfare against the Germans, and various strategy sessions and political intrigues. The acting is quite good, and I was particularly impressed by the performances of Mikhail Ulyanov as Marshal Zhukov, Horst Geise as Joseph Goebbels, Peter Sturm as Walther Model, and Nikolay Olyalin as the tough Russian soldier Tsvetaev. Writers Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov could have chosen to depict all Soviets as heroic archetypes and all Germans as Nazi sadist-murderers, but in the end they chose to be pretty fair in their depictions, and the series benefits as a result.

The reason I gave LIBERATION four rather than five stars is due to a certain amount of historical whitewash. All nations fib and distort history to make themselves look better, and the actual amount of outright lying in this film is very small -- perhaps even less than in an American war film. For example, the subject of the Russian National Liberation Army, a nationalist army organized by the Germans from Soviet POWs and defectors to fight communism, is tackled with surprising honesty -- I wouldn't have blamed the Sovs for omitting this embarrassing story completely. However, the depiction of Stalin (Bukhuti Zaqariadze) is oddly wise and all-knowing (odd because the cult of Stalin had long since been debunked when this series was shot), the portrayal of Hitler (though ably performed by East German actor Franz Deiz) is cliched and somewhat ""slanderous"" (the bunker sequences are flat-out wishful thinking on the Soviet's part), and there is a scene with Zhukov, where he orders his army to make use of searchlights to blind the German defenders, that is not only inaccurate but actually a flat-out inversion of history (Ozerov depicts the Germans as completely flabbergasted by this technique, running around with their hands over their eyes and fleeing in terror; in fact this tactic failed miserably, and merely provided the German gunners with big, sparkly targets.) Most egregiously, there is no mention whatever of Soviet atrocities in Germany. The Reds behave like Merry Men in a ""Robin Hood"" film when they reach the Fatherland, flirting with willing German girls and sparing the lives of wretched German boy soldiers. In fact, the Soviets behaved more like Mongols, slaughtering and raping on a scale that is difficult for an American to even conceive, and while I understand they wouldn't want to linger on this subject, it deserved at least a passing mention. Finally, on a technical note, though the English-speaking and German-speaking sequences are filmed in their own language, they are translated by a narrator who is overdubbed in Russian -- so we get two languages going at once while subtitles play out below. And the translations from Russian into English leave a great deal to be desired.

Having said that, I can't recommend this series highly enough. Americans and Brits love WW2 movies because they depict us in a heroic, world-saving light, while seldom or never mentioning the fact that the center of gravity in the European war was in Russia and not in the West. In fact, of Hitler's 200 divisions, 150 were deployed in Russia, along with 2/3 of his air force, and while there is little or nothing to choose morally between the Nazis and the Soviets of the same era, there is no denying that Hitler's dream of European mastery was choked by Soviet blood: 27 million Soviet citizens died between 1941 and 1945, and they inflicted 75% of the casualties suffered by the German Wehrmacht during WW2. LIBERATION, while not pretending the USSR won the war alone, gives a much-needed ""Eastern"" perspective on the world's most destructive war.",1414022400,8,8093,4.9433823529411764

8573677,3,B00BTJI2U6,"I found the film somewhat disjointed in plot and characterisation.  The very positive portrayal of Poles serving in the First Polish Army who fought alongside the Soviet forces all the way to Berlin surprised me.  However, Kazaks, Cechins, Georgians and others would probably be miffed for not being separately identified from the brave fighting Slavs.  Communist Germans serving with the Soviets were portrayed as saints, and it seemed that the rapes of German women seemed unnecessary as they were portrayed as flirting with the liberating Russian soldiers, who to the man were absolute gentlemen sharing their rations with grateful German civilians freed from evil fascism.

Stalin was portrayed as a very intuitive tactician while Zhukov was not given the credit he really deserved.  That said the battle scenes were amazing, and perhaps this focussed the attention of the director more than the characterisation and plot.

Overall, for those who have read up on WW11, and expecting a more accurate historical depiction of the Eastern Front, this movie would disappoint because it is after all Soviet propaganda during the height of the Cold War.  The message of the movie seemed to be, ""What's wrong with everyone?  We sacrificed so much to liberate half of Europe and bring them the blessings of communism"".  But despite the historical flaws I was mesmerised by this 5 part movie, or more likely a television mini series.",1459555200,2,1427,5.142857142857143
8573678,5,B00BTJI2U6,"This is a 5 film series co-production by Soviet-Polish-East German-Italian-Yugoslav. It covers the major battles between Germany and Russia during WWII. This was interesting, they used some archival footage and a lot of recreated scenes to put together an entertaining show. They are all on one disc so you have to turn it over, but this is easier because the films flow from one to the next. Very good realistic special effects on many battles scenes. This is definitely for people that are into historical stuff.",1458000000,,514,4.988372093023256

8573681,5,B00BTJI2U6,"Epic is the word to describe this 1971 Russian docudrama! The effort and resources ($$$) that went into this 5 part/7.5 hour production is nothing short of amazing! Talk about a cast of thousands  Talk about hundreds of tanks and planes  talk about incredible battle scenes (especially the tank battle at Kursk and the battle for Berlin  amazing!)

Other reviewers laud the production for its accuracy with equipment (guns & tanks & planes & uniforms). I am not an expert but if that is the case awesome! Thank you for being true to history.

The value of this film as a documentary is huge  this is the way that Communist Russia and her satellites wanted the Great Patriotic War remembered  and that is at times not quite consistent with the Anglo American narrative. It is fun to look for the differences.

The film is of course propaganda  it is intended to influence the writing of history  thus it had to reflect the party line (think Central Europe 1971). Inasmuch there is nothing negative said about the GPW. It was all honorable sacrifice to defeat the fascist scourge that threatened the world.

What you don't see is the horror the Russians brought onto the Ukrainians, Belarusians, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, Pols and Germans in their quest to eliminate the Nazis. Things like the Warsaw Uprising or the rape of perhaps a million women. More so there is no discussion about the fact that the Russian effort was an equally greedy attempt at empire that would oppress millions for 50 years!

By modern standards the film feels very Russia 1971 (but then again the World at War feels very Britain 1973 and we all love that show). Listen for the parts of the soundtrack that surely came from a bad Russian SciFi film  it is hilarious. And yes there is plenty of hokum like Hilters murder of Eva Braun and his subsequent suicide or the tank battle in the zoo. You will laugh.

The biggest problem of the film is it is just too darn long (7.5 hours). Seriously there are battle scenes that exceed 20 minutes! The film needs a good editing and it would be very simple to get it under 6 hours without hurting the very compelling story.

Finally I loved the way the film represented the major players in the WW2 (Churchill, FDR, Mussolini, Hitler & Stalin (and their staffs). Seriously there is a good history lesson here!

So why is this remarkable film is so unknown (3 reviews on IMDB and 209 ratings). Get on it WW2 history buffs  you are missing out!",1440460800,,2460,4.618390804597701
