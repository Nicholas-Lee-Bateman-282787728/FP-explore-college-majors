8138528,3,B00004CUOE,"BBC mini series that aired in the UK in 1997, goes for around two and a half hours, less the credits, and previous episode sum up at the beginning of each one.  Basically Clive Peacock is an older aged postman, who still uses a pushbike in a more modern world where the postal service expects its letter deliverers to have a driver's licence. All he's ever wanted to be was a postman, but his much younger boss tells him push bike delivers are no longer a position in the mail service.  Clive's friend is retired and spends his time metal detecting with a part time job in a fast food restaurant, which he takes Clive into the back (the old people aren't allowed on the front counter) to show him how exciting working there is (to the viewer it isn't).  Clive is depressed, his much younger wife is a nurse and will be the main breadwinner.  Delivering his last round, he realises the residents don't really appreciate him like he thought they did.  His last task is to collect the bag of mail from a street post box to take back to the depot.  Clive decides to ride his bike across the UK and deliver each letter or package personally.  His wife and the postal service have no idea why he hasn't returned to the depot/home.  He becomes The Missing Postman, and soon all sorts of people with their own agendas start using what he is doing as a way to promote what they want, even though Clive just wants to be left alone to deliver his letters.  His local neighbourhood watch police officer is determined to arrest him (stealing Royal Mail is considered a serious crime).

 An automated sorting machine has been installed in his local division, this has nothing to do with him being given early retirement but adds a British humour look at the problems these machines who are supposed to have all the answers and make life simple, are actually less efficient (this one comes to a halt over things like a paper clip being inside an envelope, and needs a technician flown in from another country to restart it when someone put an upside down stamp on it).

This is one of those TV shows that sort of changes after an episode of two.  It goes from being a conservative cosy British quirky tale, to suddenly in one episode every character getting or attempting to get bedroom action.  You're thinking this has become stupid, I bet that young blonde female British police constable is going to hook up with the grouchy old detective, and sure enough she starts to take off her shirt in the back of their surveillance van.  It's like those stories as kids in primary school you'd start, then pass to the next kid to continue who would change it into something else that resembles nothing of the initial chapters.

It's an exaggeration of the real world, journalists stop and don't pursue or enter somewhere because they are asked not to, they miss a ferry when someone tells them stop and starts talking to them while they watch their subject on it depart at one stage,  The show is okay, but no where near as exciting as I'd thought it to be.  Plus he doesn't deliver many letters, so you don't see many UK locations.",1522281600,,3112,4.497335701598579
