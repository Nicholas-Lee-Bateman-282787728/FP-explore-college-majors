This was recorded on the day my mum was in hospital about to give birth to me (funny thing, I bought an Artley flute - same as Ian used in the early days - and that was ALSO born in 1977).
The picture quality isn't great but it's certainly watchable, and the sound is fine. The performances of each musician is quite simply staggering though - watch Barrie drag out his old drum kit and flail away on it during ""Velvet Green"" and marvel. I mean, seriously, the musicianship here is incredible - I started to wonder if it had been overdubbed, but that's not very likely given the context and also the fact that Ian hits a few flat notes in his vocals (not enough to stand out to most people, but I'm sure he would have sorted it if he'd been doing any overdubs).
I can't recommend this highly enough - my one issue is that it ends. I could have watched them perform like this for a good few hours!
Oh, there is one other thing - Ian's banter. Little bit cringeworthy at times, with the wine bottle and that although he was playing it up for a TV audience so went a little more OTT than his normal manic self. His cavorting around during the instrumental section of ""TAAB"" is brilliant though, flailing his flute and standing on one leg, the whole thing.
This is quite simply one of the best live music performances you'll ever see IMO and is well worth the money.

8249425,3,B00136Z4UG,"This dvd is not an official release, although it used to be a highly sought-after VHS among traders until it was released on DVD. Actually recorded to promote the release of Songs From The Woods and broacasted on BBC's Wwow show -the logos are there at the beginning of each song to prove it- along with some weird asian-character subtitles for  Ian's in-between-songs banter.

Performance is intense, Ian's energy is as high as on the last dvd I watched, Lugano '05 !! He can be seen gulping from a big vodka bottle between songs; hardly politically correct for today's standards, gotta love that !! Opener is Skating Away my all-time fav from my fav JT album, Warchild. Bummer it's the beginning of a 3-song acoustic set, the metally main riff replaced by an....accordion riff.

By track 4 the electric set explodes and it rocks. The profusion of keyboards was to ever be seen again on a JT stage, prolly because back then you needed a lot of machines for the different sounds.

Picture : good VHS pic with acceptable graininess, aeons away form an original master tape, mind you. High picture bitrate, no chroma or gamma problems. Has a simple but nice still menu that works fine. Lots of camera angles and EXCELLENT filming.

Sound : just acceptable; vox WAY too high in the mix. Instruments, esp guitar, sound weak unless you are willing to put up with a LOT of shouting on the part of Ian's. Bottom end is there but be prepared to crank you sub.

If you are into early TV recordings of rock bands like Rockpalast, BBC's, etc, you will prolly like this one. Hardly a must-have and getting it on the cheap was mandatory in my case, but I'd rather keep it than not.

Tracklist :
01 - Skating Away (acoustic)
02 - Jack In The Green (acoustic w/electric guitar&drums)
03 - Thick As A Brick (acoustic/electric, full rhythm section)
04 - Songs From The Wood

8249426,1,B00136Z4UG,"Actually, my one star does not concern Jethro Tull's performance.  It's stellar from ""Skating Away (On the Thin Ice of the New Day)"" to ""Locomotive Breath/Land of Hope and Glory,"" but is it a legitimate release?  Jethro Tull Live from the Hippodrome is not included on the band's web site, nor is it included in any of the Tull stores with which the site is linked.  I know that this 1977 Sight & Sound performance has been making the rounds amongst collectors under various titles.  If you choose to shell out the money being asked for this DVD, just beware.  You may want to contact the seller about the quality of the video AND audio before you sign the check.",1239235200,9,663,4.491666666666666
