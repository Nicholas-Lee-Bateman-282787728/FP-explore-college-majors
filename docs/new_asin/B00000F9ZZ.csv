8212348,5,B00000F9ZZ,"The Fractal Experience video is excellent. I began enjoying fractals on my Mac over 10 years ago. This video is a dream come true for fractal lovers who enjoy the mind-bending pleasure of viewing these mathematical wonders.
No, it's not a treatise on the theoretical aspects of fractals - there are many, many books and other videos covering that. Instead we are treated to a stunning parade of colorful, powerful images, accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack. Viewed with or without the 3-D glasses, these animated fractals are almost frightening in their power to evoke emotion and awe.
I only wish that the video was longer and was available on DVD!",973728000,8,652,4.9363636363636365
8212349,1,B00000F9ZZ,"""The Fractal Experience"" is probably right on the money, for those looking for ""cool""!  What you get are very good fractal images, morphing from one to another; along with music background.  Very  good, for those at that level.  My interest go more to the math, history,  and the fellow who pioneered the field (Benoit Mandelbrot); along with demo  images.  If that's what you want, look elsewhere!",952992000,11,398,4.9393939393939394
