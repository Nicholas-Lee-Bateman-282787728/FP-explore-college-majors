8660835,1,B00KQKR8JU,This disc did not play on my region A player nor on my multi region player. It is suppose to be a region ABC bluray but it is a bdr. It says that it also includes DVD and digital copy but it only includes the crappy defective bdr bootleg. Purchased from DaaVeeDee via Amazon. Not impressed at all.,1523232000,2,297,4.137931034482759
8660836,4,B00KQKR8JU,"NIGHT OF THE DEMON is one of the best (if not the best) horror films from the late 1950s. Directed by Jacques Tourneur (Cat People, I Walked With A Zombie, The Leopard Man) this atmospheric black & white film based on the short story ""Casting the Runes"" by Montague R. James fills the viewer with a sense of lurking dread and suspense (qualities Tourneur excelled at). The cast is above par for a horror film of the day and includes Dana Andrews, Peggy Cummins, and Niall MacGinnis, who steals the show with his chilling performance as devil cult leader Dr. Julian Karswell. Better known in the US as CURSE OF THE DEMON, the original British production includes 14 minutes of extra footage. One of the major scenes cut for the US release is Holden's (Andrews) visit to the Hobarth farm. However the major point of contention is the Demon itself. A veteran of the Val Lewton films of the 1940s, Tourneur was an ardent believer in suggested horror, and together with Charles Bennet who wrote the original screenplay, was opposed to showing the Demon, believing the shots of smoking clouds and smoldering footprints sufficient proof for the existence of the monster. Despite their protests, US producer Hal Chester, asserting that US filmgoers would expect a visible monster, had screenwriter Cy Enfield insert the Demon scenes. Despite the fact that virtually no extra funds were made available, spfx artists at Shepperton Studios (supervised by Wally Veevers who would later create the effects for 2001, A Space Odyssey) did a mostly commendable job. Although the long shots of the Demon puppet are less than believable, the close-ups of the Demon mask are quite good. One could easily argue how popular this film would be today if not for the inclusion of the monster.
The film quality on this bluray is good but not pristine. While I didn't perceive any scratches or other blemishes, there was no evidence of any kind of restoration. Still, it is noticeably sharper with less film grain than the dvd version, and the English DTS-HD soundtrack is crystal clear. I had no problems playing this disc on a new Oppo and a 3 yr.-old Panasonic bluray player. It also played fine on a PS3. The menu is in Spanish but easy to figure out (select ""Ingles"" under ""IDIOMAS""). Since Columbia Pictures hasn't released this on bluray and likely never will, this is your best bet. Highly recommended! I would also recommend TARANTULA on bluray. Make sure you get the Italian release which is region A, B, & C and not the German release which is region B only. It's available from Amazon and played on all the players mentioned above.",1514246400,3,2617,4.792035398230088
8660837,5,B00KQKR8JU,"Great copy of a nifty little horror flick,highly recommended. If you liked Drag me to hell(clearly influenced by this)then you'll enjoy this. Surprisingly effective fx for a 1950s film, with some good suspense and a sense of humor to boot. With Spanish and English audio/subtitles and a nice transfer.",1498521600,,301,5.163265306122449
8660838,5,B00KQKR8JU,"Luminous, silvery, black and white---Great clarity---better than the DVD.  Film critic William K. Everson called this the last of the classic horror films.  It's never looked better than on this Blu-Ray print.  It plays just fine on my ""USA"" Samsung Blu-Ray player.",1465948800,,265,5.261904761904762

8660840,5,B00KQKR8JU,"This terrific movie played perfectly on my multi-region Oppo Blu-ray player.

Warning!  Do not watch this movie at night.

When the movie started the audio was in the Spanish dubbing. A simple push of the language button on my Blu-ray remote switched the language to its original English.

Excellent picture and sound.",1455753600,,318,5.0576923076923075
8660841,1,B00KQKR8JU,"Cannot review film as DVD would not play.  Description says film plays in Regions A, B and C, but this would not work in my Sony player.",1454371200,,136,4.037037037037037
8660842,5,B00KQKR8JU,"The other person who posted a review did NOT post it for the above pictured movie, but unfortunately gave it no stars.
Disregard the zero stars.
I agree with them that their assessment of that OTHER movie, Night of the Demons (PLURAL) is correct; it is a useless piece of recent trash.
The problem lies in the fact that the great 1957 movie pictured above was originally released in England  as Curse of the Demon, and in the United States as Night of the Demon (SINGULAR)
The above pictured DVD is a tense horror movie of the type that plays on your imagination without the use of cheesy looking creatures. On two occasions in the movie when the demon starts tearing his victims up it is depicted momentarily in a realistic montage which puts a scare into the dark recesses of your mind. Gripping stuff, superbly directed by a master storyteller, Jacques Tourneour.",1451001600,5,866,4.660130718954249
