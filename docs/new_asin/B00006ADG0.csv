1736954,5,B00006ADG0,"this film is a great watch! something in this would apply to everyone.

the movie is full of subtleties that you almost have to watch it carefully several times, to pick up on all the great moments and appreciate them. the girl in the film who is one of the main characters does a great job of showing the suffering and efforts of refugees, women in a society dominated by men, and children living in poor conditions. she doesnt speak once throughout the entire film, yet her story is clear, and you feel she has told you her entire life history.

the movie highlights the forgotton, or ignored plight of afghans living as refugees. this particular film shows the situation as it took place in iran, where many afghans fled following the soviet invasion.

i recommend this to all. the film is in farsi with subtitles, but this doesnt make it a film that only applies to a foreign audience who understands the original dialect, this will touch you.",1104796800,6,947,4.591715976331361

1736956,5,B00006ADG0,"This is my favorite of Majidi's movies.  It combines the sweetness and gentleness of his Children of Heaven (1987)with an objective look at lower and lower middle class Iranian society, and the impact of the infusion of immigrant Afghani workers into that mix.  It also shows, and this is probably going to be lost on the most Western viewers (it certainly was for me until I visited Majidi's website), some of the underlying tensions between Iranians of different backgrounds.  Among the groups represented are Kurds, Azeris, and Lurs.
  One of the things that makes this film so touching is how the main character, Lateef, is transformed from a shirking, irresponsible and selfish young boy into a man through his love and sympathy for a young Afghani refugee, Baran.  Although it may sound unusual that this love affair develops with perhaps no more than five or six words spoken between Baran and Lateef, what happens on screen seems completely understandable and convincing.
  There is one extremely powerful and startling image that Majidi uses towards the end of the movie that represents the untranscendable social division between the two.  That is the snapping of Baran's burkha over her head as she and Lateef part for the last time.  Never has that particular symbol seemed so intrusive and unfair in a film to me before.  This time it was not for any political or religious reasons.  Rather it was especially cruel because it divided Baran from Lateef permanently.",1080864000,8,1477,4.983673469387755
1736957,5,B00006ADG0,"One night when I was browsing around the video rental store, I found a movie, Baran, sitting there on the shelf, and I knew I just had to watch it! Since it was foreign, Baran intrigued me right away.
This Iranian movie made by Majid Majidi has a very calm atmosphere that will suck the watcher right into the movie, almost as if he or she were actually in Tehran.
The story is about a seventeen-year-old Iranian named Lateef who works at a construction site in Tehran. He does the little jobs, like serve the workman tea, or buys the lunch for the work site that day. Suddenly, when an Afghan worker has an accident, his son, Rahmat fills in for his injured father's place. Lateef finds Rahmat annoying; he can't lift very heavy things very well, and is sometimes clumsy. Also, Rahmat is a better cook, which takes away from Lateef's job, and Lateef then has to do more construction work. The big twist of the movie is when Lateef finds out Rahmat's secret, which then changes their lives.
Baran is a very good movie; it has no guns, weapons, or political muck. It simply tells a believable story about two teenagers in modern Iran. While watching it, I found it sad how the Iranian government doesn't like Afghan refugees in their country. During the movie the construction team had to keep it quiet and lie about what nationality that some of the workers, like Rahmat's, were. Also, I think to understand the plot better, the viewer should know a little background information of Iran/Afghanistan. The biggest reason I like this movie (besides being so un-Hollywood) is the ending, which is when a big rainstorm came to Tehran. That is very poetic way to end a movie, since Baran means rain.",1073952000,3,1694,4.612582781456954
1736958,5,B00006ADG0,"Majid Majidi, director of ""The Children of Heaven"" (first Oscar-nominated film from Iran), gives us another heart-warming (and slightly poignant) film about ""Baran"" (meaning ""Rain"").  The film has a romantic taste in a subdued narrative, and perhaps a very immediate and political message.  But like a lovable brother and sister in ""Heaven,"" ""Baran"" is about the two people in Iran tenderly depicted by Majidi.
The story starts with a young man Lateef working at a construction site somewhere in Iran.  The work is hard, and many workers are actually not Iranian, but illegal immigirants from Afghanistan.  The boss Memar (excellent Mohammad Amir Naji, father of the children in ""Heaven"") is in fact a good fellow, but doesn't (or cannot) give much wage to them.  There, Lateef has been assigned a rather easy job, serving tea and bread because of his father.
But one day Lateef must start to work, this time a real one.  For one of the workers of the place broke his leg, and a son of the injured, very small boy named Rahmat, replaces this guy who could be lazy until then.  Sulky, discontent, Rahmat acts very nastily before this small boy ... until he finds a surprising secret about ""Rahmat"" who in fact is named ""Baran.""
The rest of the story should remain untold.  The man begins to  change his attitudes to this newcomer, silently protecting Baran and keeping the secret from the people around them.  But what can he do?  And how far can he go when he knows someday Baran and the family must go back to the country where the society is still very unstable?  All those emotional changes happening in this man's heart are tactly dealt with Majidi's lyrical narrative, without being too sugary and sentimental.
I understand some people's complaint that this film (and Iranian films in general) is too slow-moving.  And I think the latter half, which should have shown more of Baran, seems a bit overlong.  The 90 minutes surely feel long even for me (though I have watched many films from that country).  Still, the charms of the simple tale with rich details of the everyday life in Iran which the Western media rarely cover are irresitible.
Certainly it moves slow, but ""Baran"" presents us what a good cinema can do with its good visuals and sincere attitudes towards filmmaking and the people it pictures.
Those who are interested in Iran-Afghanistan relations should see ""Kandahar"" and ""The Cyclist.""  The former in a sense follows the possible life of Baran, and the latter is a big hit in Iran about a most desperate bet done by an aged illegal immigrant from Afghanistan, who has to ride a bicycle through one whole week.",1060905600,6,2633,4.77924944812362
1736959,4,B00006ADG0,"It's a pretty simple story about a Iranian boy's developing affections for a Afghan refugee girl. The situation is complicated by her masquerading as a boy to earn some desperately needed money for her family.
Although it deals with youong love, this movie is by no means a fairy tale, which is the fate of almost all Hollywood movies telling similar stories. The characters may dream and yearn, but reality is always pressing and uncompromising.  But the movie also offer hope.  Perhaps in the end, life is not about the gratification of our desires, but how we reached out to others.",1052179200,4,585,4.782178217821782
1736960,5,B00006ADG0,"I watched the movei ""Baran"" (Rain) last night. It was a beautifuly done in a background rarely suited for a love story ( a construction site!).

I recommend it to all who want to understand the aspirations of those who live in abject poverty and yet have characters so strong.

1736961,5,B00006ADG0,"After two masterpieces, Children of Heaven and Children of Paradise, Majidi does it again, and creates yet another masterpiece with Baran. He is one of the most talented directors in any language or era, as he uses a cinematic language that on one hand reminds me a lot of the european greats like Bergman, Truffaut and DeSica.., yet on the other is a reflection of his culture and environment.
The love and infatuation that the teenager Hossein feels for  Baran is simple, innocent, and well..doomed. It had to be from the start..An Afghan refugee working on a building site to support her family after her father has an accident,concealing her identity as a result, and a working class and poor Iranian boy, who at the beginning of the film was the irresponsible joker, and whose life is totally transformed by his 'discovery' and love.
The genuis of Majidi, is that he films this story without  sentimentality yet with great compassion and love for his characters,and with a camera work that is pure poetry.
There are many unforgettable scenes in Baran, but the one that haunted me the most was when Baran's secret is discovered by Hossein. The acting is great from the amateur leads, especially Baran who doesn't say a word in the whole film, but whose face speaks volume, acting worthy of top rewards!!
Iranian cinema in general and Majidi in particular have proven that cinema is a truly universal art, like music, it brings people together regardless of their cultures or faiths,  like no other art form can.
Baran is a must buy for any cinema lover, a film full of colour, soul and dignity.",1044316800,17,1598,4.76173285198556

He losses his job to an Afghan newcomer by the name Rahmat.  In the beginning Lateef is very hateful toward Rahmat and he does everything possible to make life sour for Rahmat.  However, this changes when Lateef notice something odd about Rahmat and his hatred reverses. The film becomes a love story where Lateef expresses his love with unselfish acts of care in which he jeopardizes his own future.  It should be mentioned that Baran is a wonderful and humane film that pushes the envelop in Iran, since it is illegal to make and show love stories on film in Iran.",1037232000,3,703,4.555555555555555

I don't want to spoil by revealing the last one. Just an ephemeral celebration of love in a form that actually isn't a cliche. I absolutely loved it and have a new favorite.",1437004800,,351,4.587301587301587
1736964,3,B00006ADG0,"Majid Majidi directed two of my favorite movies- Children of Heaven and The Color of Paradise. I fell in love with those movies the first time I saw them 10 years ago, but for whatever reason, I never got to watch Baran until recently. I watched it without reading a plot synopsis, and before reading any other reviews. I think that may have been a mistake. Baran isn't a bad movie, but the whole time I was watching it, I kept wondering where all this was going. The message is there, and not too hard to find if you're paying attention, yet its definitely going in a different direction than Majidis other 2 films I mentioned. Of course, I don't expect everything to be the same or done in a similar manner, but Baran does feel like more of an art film than the others, relying more on long shots of facial expressions and silence than it does on storytelling.

Lateef is a young man in his late teens, working as a server and shopper for a construction site. His boss, Memar, is an easily angered man, who also has a heart of gold and wishes for the best of his employees. One day, an Afghan man, Najaf, falls from the second story and breaks his leg. The accident needs to be kept a secret, due to it being a big no-no for Afghans to be employed there. Soon, Najafs son, Rahmat, comes in to do his work. The boy is young and weak, not fit to do physical labor, and is soon given Lateefs job, doing things much better than Lateef could ever do even on his best day. This angers him to no end, and he gives Rahmat a hard time, messing up the kitchen, refusing drinks, and even slapping him at one point. After a few days, Lateef notices something while Rahmat is alone in the kitchen as the curtain over the door blows in the wind. What is it? Well, look at the movies box art and it shouldnt be too hard to figure out.

Then again, if you take even one glance at Rahmat, youll figure it out right off the bat.

Where Baran shines is letting the emotions do the talking, and showing just how bad things are for the characters. When something bad happens to a character, and someone else is reacting to it, you can feel what they're going through just by the look on their face. If youve seen Children of Heaven, youll remember how terrified those poor kids looked when they feared their dad would find out about the shoes. Theres a lot of that here, only theres more on the line. Lateef becomes obsessed with Rahmat after finding out the secret, and follows him day after day, watching his every move. When he leaves town to see how Rahmat is doing, we see that what they're doing to get by is a heck of a lot worse than what most people go through on a daily basis around here. When you see connections between a battlefield and people moving stones from a cold stream, you know its bad. I say all this, and I don't want you to think its a downer of a movie. There are only a handful of scenes like this. Most of the movie is spent with Lateef searching for Rahmat, at work and outside of work, and the rest is showing how good of a man Memar is, despite his poor situation with Afghan workers and inspectors.

One of the things that bugged me about Baran is the big reveal with Rahmat. Im sure youve figured it out by now so theres no use in barely trying to hide it anymore. But look at Rahmat for even a second and youll see that shes a beautiful young girl. How anyone at a construction site could think shes a boy is beyond me. They give her several layers of mens clothing, a hat and a scarf, and its supposed to be a disguise. Yeah right. The other thing may make me sound like I have a short attention span, but I wouldve liked it if a little more happened in the movie. Baran herself is barely featured after a key event takes place, and like I said earlier, there are a lot of long shots with no dialogue. I was expecting something to happen many times, only for the scene to end and move on to the next.

Majidi did a great job making a coming of age story come to life, with some great examples of how the lead character grows throughout, making some pretty mature and noble decisions. I don't recommend watching Baran if you're even a little bit sleepy, because the long shots and quiet might make you doze off. Of the 3 films by Majidi Ive seen, this one is definitely in third place. Its worth watching once, but (and I feel bad saying this) you can read the plot summary somewhere and save yourself a lot of time. Baran is the kind of film that couldve been more effective if it were trimmed downand here its barely over an hour and a half.",1424736000,,4559,4.217640320733104

1736974,5,B00006ADG0,"I've seen two previous films from director Majid Majidi - ""The Father"", which seemed more than a little overwrought in it's portrait of a perpetually angry boy dealing with his hated stepfather, and ""Children of Heaven"", a well-done and quite beautiful but somewhat sappy entry into the popular Iranian true-life kids adventure genre. They're both worth seeing, but they seemed to confirm to me what I've read from some critics - he's a rather shallow crowd-pleaser with characters drawn in thick brushstrokes and lots of manipulative emotional melodrama.

I'm pleased to say that though ""Baran"" doesn't totally avoid the problems I've seen in the other two films, it has a story and a concentration of purpose that allows it to get away with them, or perhaps to minimize the flaws. I will try as others have done not to ""spoil"" the central revelation in the film, though it does make discussing the film rather difficult. As the film (the title means ""rain"" in Kurdish) opens, the teenaged Iranian Lateef is going about his job as errand-boy and tea-server for a construction crew that employs a lot of illegal Afghan workers on a grungy, several story building in Tehran. Lateef is lazy and has a quick temper, but somehow manages to keep his job - I assumed that he had a personal relationship with the foreman, Memar, and this turned out to be correct - and he's infuriated when a young Afghan refugee, Rahmat, is given his job and he has to start doing the regular manual labor. Rahmat is the son of an injured worker and needs to work to help the family, but he's too small and weak to carry cement bags around. Lateef plots to undermine Rahmat - who quickly proves better at the errands, tea-serving and cooking than Lateef was - until he discovers the secret...

And it probably isn't going to be hard for anybody to guess what the secret is; I will just tell you that ""Baran"" is Rahmat's real name and leave it at that.  This is the point where the film naturally turns into something different - a strange kind of love story, as Lateef instantly finds himself attracted to Baran, and tries to become a protector (as well as, it must be said, something of a stalker). Here also is where some familiarity with Iranian cinema and censorship might be helpful; if you've seen a number of films from the post-1980 period, you may find, as I did, the scene in which Rahmat/Baran is ""revealed"" absolutely breathtaking. So much in this film is utterly simple - and maybe even silly to our eyes - but through the eyes of a sexually/romantically frustrated Iranian youth, it's dead serious, and very powerful.

The second and third acts of the movie, then, are about Lateef's efforts to get to know and to help Baran and family. The lengths he goes to - and the sacrifices he makes - may seem pretty bizarre given how little he knows about the situation, but within the culture and social strata that the characters live in, they seem fairly believable. What I loved about Lateef's ""journey"" is how we really get to experience the antiquity and decrepitude of this ancient city - and culture - buildings falling down and being rebuilt, families living in ramshackle huts next to rivers that run right through the city; people who live as they might have in Biblical times. The film subtly points out that Lateef does live in the modern world of automobiles and shops selling cigarettes and magazines, bosses with cell phones - and yet he cannot even touch or talk to somebody who has come to mean so much to him.

""Baran"" is goregously shot, with some virtuso camerawork that includes a wonderful long crane shot throught he bowels of the construction site and some of the better uses of slow-mo that I've seen recently; in the end, the film really worked on me, and it's another fine example of how Iranian filmmakers have continued to call attention to their society's injustices and the impossibilities of really living under it's strictures.  Released in 2001 in the middle of the relatively open and less censorious Khatami regime, this film probably could not have been made 10 years later.  But regardless of all the political and religious messages under and on the surface, at heart this is an impossible love story, and a beautiful and very sad one.",1380153600,,4258,4.6997319034852545

1736978,5,B00006ADG0,"This is another amazingly beautiful film from the contemporary (Persian) Truffaut. Although the Rahmat character does not utter a single word throughout the film, the viewer is drawn into her struggle and captivated by Lateef's love. In the end, Lateef, a boy who has very little by western standards, sees how much more he has than the Afghan refugee workers at this Iranian construction site. He sees in an instant the hardship faced by this voiceless, powerless young girl and eventually gives up everything to protect and express love for her. Without ever speaking to her he ensures that she will somehow survive and reach her homeland. The interactions between Lateef and Rahmat tend to become less direct and more voyeuristic as the story unfolds and even this cynical western viewer was left believing that Lateef could sacrifice his identity (literally) to save a young woman who would never do anything for him. This is a love story so powerfully told that we needed none of the gimmicks of western filmmaking, nor even dialogue to believe an incredible story. Majidi has found some great actors, and there are some well crafted situations, but primarily he tells his stories through visual depictions of astounding pain and desperation superimposed on amazing cinematography. Viewers eventually learn that the girl's real name is ""Baran"" which also means rain in Farsi, and scenes filled with the sight and sound of coming rain highlight the bleak situation for the Afghan workers at the construction site. Majidi plays with images and symbols like this throughout his films and they are a joy to uncover. This is visual poetry.

A young man was annoyed when Baran first started working at the construction site, but when he finds out Baran's true identity, and how important her job is for supporting her family, he sees her through an entirely new perspective.

I loved the topic that the movie covers. Living in the United States, it's easy for me and others to fail to understand immigration issues in countries on the other side of the world. I was aware that there were a ton of Afghans fleeing to Pakistan whenever the Afghani government was less than favorable, but I didn't realize there was such a problem in Iran. This movie successfully demonstrates that, as immigration inspectors visit the work site and routinely check for illegal immigrants. This movie can teach you something about the life of Afghanis in Iran while the Taliban was in power, all without a complicated plot or extensive dialog.

For those of you who are looking for a ""different"" kind of romance in a movie, one in which love and gratitude is expressed without dialog or physical contact, then you might like this movie. I personally thought that it was a sweet movie to watch once, but not so amazing that I'd want to watch it over and over again. I love the other movies by Majid Majidi, but I guess the romance in this movie wasn't very believable, at least not to me.",1306540800,6,1582,4.586572438162544

I was moved to tears when Lateef cried and begged for his money from Memar (his boss). What a man! Yes, I refrain from describing him as a kid because, he was actually a man deeply in love.

There were too many scenes that were moving; that I found myself skipping back to the scene to see it again. But I will list a few scenes:

~The tea and sugar for Lateef scene
~Lateef waiting for his bread from Baran during lunch break
~Finding the hair clip with a strand of hair
~The hands scene near the end when Lateef helped Baran pick up the  vegetables from the ground
~The shoe scene as if it was a Cinderella story

Here's a quote from the wise shoe repairman: ""From the hot fire of being apart comes the flame that burns the heart.""

I would have liked that both characters stared longer at each other during the ""hands scene"". Heck! Lateef should have asked for Baran's hand in marriage.

It shows the complexity of the situation in this region without resorting to boring political talk.

The young man cannot (for religious reasons and also because he's the only one who knows the girl's real identity) show his love for this girl, and it leads to a very sad conclusion.  This is a really remarkable film, told with grace and subtlety.  Most, if not all, Iranian films I've seen have this other worldly, poetic quality to them.  They are immensely poetic and humanistically told, without any violence, sex, or profane language.  Someone commented on Children of Heaven, another masterpiece from Madiji, that people should watch films from Iran, so you can discover the other side of the country, rather than the mindless depiction the MSM gives you.  This is a great film to start with.",1198281600,2,1396,4.676229508196721

1736987,4,B00006ADG0,"This is a low-key but affecting story about a young man learning to love.

Seventeen-year-old Latif works at a construction site for a friend of his father.  He's all hormones and bumptiousness, quick to laugh, and quick to pick fights with the older workers who toss jibes at him.  Many of his co-workers are Afghani immigrants who have left their war-torn country looking for a better life.  Latif is in charge of the kitchen, preparing meals and serving tea to the workers.  When one of the Afghani workers falls out a window and breaks his ankle, he sends his son Rahmat to take his place, since the family desperately needs the money.  This boy isn't strong enough for heavy labor, so the foreman puts him in the kitchen in place of Latif.

Enraged, Latif loses no opportunity to torment Rahmat, until the day he sees the lad furtively combing out his long, black hair and realizes Rahmat is a girl, a beautiful one at that.  Latif goes from bitter to smitten, and takes to protecting Rahmat from the other workers.  He even risks jail to keep her from being picked up by the Immigration officers.  When the foreman is forced to lay off the Afghani workers, Latif's new love disappears back into her country neighborhood.  Latif uses all his spare time to find her, and all his money to help her dirt-poor family. Through all of this, he never actually talks to Rahmat, or spends any time with her.  Loving her though, transforms him from a callow youth into a compassionate, even noble, young man.

Baran presents a type of love we in western societies don't usually experience.  Latif's behavior towards Rahmat is fervent, self-sacrificing, and abstract.  The idea of his love for her seems to drive him more than the prospect of actually interacting with her.  Part of this is surely cultural.  At the movie's end, just when it seems that they're about to talk, she throws a buhrka over her head and turns away to her father's truck.  Latif is left with a hair pin she dropped and the image of her footprint in the mud, soon washed away by heavy rains.  You can imagine how this intense, abstract emotion could be transformed in young men into a willingness to die for the abstract idea of a perpetual afterlife.

Hossein Abedini gives an energetic but emotionally shaded performance as Latif.  Actress Zahra Bahrami doesn't speak one word for the entire movie, but conveys all of Rahmat's feelings and yearnings through her lustrous black eyes.  Director Magid Majidi does a great job conveying the dust and sweat of hard labor - there's a particularly wrenching scene where Rahmat and other women find work lifting heavy boulders out of a cold stream.  Without romanticizing, he also shows us the bonds that form among poor working men.

I've also seen Majidi's film Children of Heaven, about a brother and sister in a poor neighborhood in Tehran, and would recommend it highly.",1158278400,9,2888,4.73
1736988,4,B00006ADG0,"This is a gently heartbreaking film set in Tehran, a city flooded with Afghan refugees during the time of Taliban rule in their homeland. It touches on several themes, including the plight of the refugees, and those of them who work illegally as laborers in the construction industry. Much of the story takes place at a construction site, where the central character, a young Iranian, a short-tempered lad full of complaints about his lowly status among the other workmen, gradually discovers within himself a heartfelt compassion for the refugees in the person of a girl masquerading as a boy to support the family of her disabled father, injured at the work site.

The young man's compassion is ignited by the love he begins to feel for this girl, and there begins a series of selfless sacrifices that he makes for her and her family. Though they never exchange a word in the film, she leaves a deep impression on him, and he is utterly changed by his experience. A story that is about the transformation of character, the film sometimes struggles to externalize this process, often observing the main character as he watches from the sidelines, wordlessly ponders his situation, or goes in search of the girl and her family. Director Magid Magidi compensates in part by revealing the working conditions of the men, the difficulties of the contractor in charge of them, and the unforgiving weather (snow, rain, cold) in which they all labor. Recommended for the window it opens into a world rarely revealed by the cinema or the news media.",1155945600,4,1541,4.859315589353612
1736989,4,B00006ADG0,"Baran is a beautiful film that, oddly enough, primarily takes place at a construction site in Iran.  The plot is simple and sweet; the characters are well-developed; the cinematography is often stunning ... Baran has all the makings of a great film, and it is, indeed, very enjoyable.

There were 2 things that I especially liked about this movie.  First of all, Baran is the first Iranian film I've seen, and I was grateful for a glimpse into a culture that I know very little about.  I thought Majid Majidi - the director's - portrait of Iranian and Afghan-refugee workers was at once lovely and painful.  Specifically, it is somewhat difficult to view the conditions that the characters live and work in - and yet - the film in no way asks for sympathy.  It is simply telling a story, and the characters happen to work low-paying, back-breaking jobs.  That is their reality.  Also worth noting, the entire movie does not take place at a dirty, grimy job-site.  The main character, a teenager named Latif, leaves on several excursions.  These scenes are especially beautiful.  Even if this film lacked plot and characters (which it, thankfully, does not), I would have to give it some credit for the aesthetic quality of these scenes.

The second thing that I especially liked about this movie was the way it was able to make a very innocent and restrained gesture seem provocative.  There is a footprint in the mud toward the end of the movie that is - somehow - an evocation of sexual and emotional longing.  There is another scene, during which a male and a female pick up a basket of food that has spilled, and though their hands never touch, it is one of the most erotic cinematic moments I think I've ever witnessed.

Worth noting - Baran moves rather slowly.  I wouldn't say it's boring, but it's certainly languid.  There also seem to be a few problems with the flow of scenes.  I could be wrong, but occasionally, I found myself disoriented when it would cut abruptly from one moment to the next.  But this is really a trivial observation.  Overall, Baran is a very nice film.  If not profound, it's at least quietly beautiful.",1150156800,2,2138,4.648
1736990,5,B00006ADG0,"Baran beautifully tells the timeless story of self-sacrifice, self-giving love, of grace. It is all the more amazing given the cultural backgrounds of the two main characters. The poignant ending brought tears to my eyes and a smile to my lips. This is a movie I will watch yearly and am glad to own.",1142208000,2,300,4.574074074074074
1736991,5,B00006ADG0,"I happened upon Iranian cinema a few years ago. Prior to this I rarely
thought about Iran, if at all. Baran has become a favorite of mine for
the simple reason that it connects with the viewer viscerally, tapping
the verities written long ago within all of us, highlighting our
commonality rather than our supposedly irreconcilable differences. It's
all plausible now.

I like this film for many reasons. One is that I grew up shy, and
Lateef's advances towards his new found love -- while stretching
credulity with some reviewers -- perfectly captures the fits and starts
of attending to one's heart's desire, looking into another human's eyes,
and sensing a vast gulf that first must be crossed.

It strikes me that nations are sometimes in this position, too,
separated by historical events, but unlike improbable lovers, a mutual
respect seems even less likely. While art can't usher in utopia here on
earth, it can start to chip away at the impediments we as societies find
ourselves constrained by. Baran is a film of great beauty, a small
masterpiece not unlike a series of paintings, displaying a richness of
images and ideas.

Baran is rewarding on many levels, and based on the numerous positive
reviews, you, too, may find it compelling and memorable. A film to
share with dearest of friends.",1128643200,3,1303,4.886877828054299
1736992,5,B00006ADG0,"Beautiful. When the movie begins, the young lead character is a selfish, self-absorbed, lazy young man. He is looking for the quickest way to make money with the least effort...and like many of his peers, has an intense dislike for the refugee father and ""son"" who come to work with the company he is employed with. I mean, this fellow is just awful. He's so obnoxious, you keep waiting for him to do something appealing so you can stop wishing he'd fall off of the building.

And then he does. He finds out, by accident, that the ""son"" is really a young woman. And he is immediately drawn to her. Suddenly, instead of being the tormentor he is the protector, of her physically and of her secret.

When events transpire that lead him to search for her(well, I can't give EVERYTHING away, now can I?), we get to see the maturation process in action. Caring for someone other than himself gives him a strength and a resolve that even he did not know he had and brings him to an incredible sacrifice to help out her family.

Iranian films rarely have what we would traditionally call ""happy endings"". Those are rare and not sought after. But there are endings that aren't horrid, just sort of sad, in a good way. It's hard to explain, but this film supplies an excellent example. In Iran, princes don't rescue the princesses, they usually get mangled by the dragon, but it's never a dull ride(and in this case he doesn't actually get mangled...).",1126569600,4,1443,4.563706563706564
