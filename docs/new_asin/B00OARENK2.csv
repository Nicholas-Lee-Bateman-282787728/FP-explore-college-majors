8683052,5,B00OARENK2,The guy is amazing.  The back stage/behind the scenes conversations are all in Japanese so if you don't speak it you will miss that but the concert footage is awesome.,1428192000,,167,4.566666666666666
8683053,4,B00OARENK2,LOVE Miyavi! The content of his shows and the tour was perfect!!!! The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is because the English subtitles are not on the disc! It specifically states on the package that there should be subtitles but there are none. So disappointed in the manufacturer.,1424649600,,288,4.666666666666667
8683054,3,B00OARENK2,"There is supposed to be English subtitles on this release...there are none. I'm returning this item & hopefully will get a replacement that has the subtitles on it, as they are the main reason I purchased the DVD.",1423699200,,213,4.631578947368421
