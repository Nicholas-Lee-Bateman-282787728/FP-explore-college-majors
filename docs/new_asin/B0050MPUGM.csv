4515862,4,B0050MPUGM,Ragini mms was a very very impressive ghost found footage film. The acting and reactions were very believable and intense though I did feel that the suspense got weaker toward the end. There were some bad CGI scenes in this film but it was creepy enough to forgive those scenes. If you love ghost films and found footage films....check this out!!,1345680000,,346,4.688524590163935
4515863,2,B0050MPUGM,"For the umpteenth time we have a young couple in an isolated house haunted by it's previous owner because of some unresolved bad thing that happened there. Those spirits need better PR agents - they just can't get a break. Customary blurry spirit (thankfully just a a few seconds). Security type cameras placed throughout the house by boyfriend so he can secretly record and sell any potential sex scenes with his girlfriend and that combined with the partying and rudeness is unusual for India film.  Two visiting friends and the boyfriend of our first couple seem to die or get their blood makeup done off camera. A few suggestive sex scenes but mostly verbal. Tame by American & European standards but for Bollywood, even Bollywood filmed overseas, quite uncommon largely due to cultural prohibitions and industry censorship. The only unclothed scene is after a shower and it's even poorly computer blurred.

The only positive was the, an often filmed scenario in horror movies, female survivor being suspended by the spirit midair against a wall. A well done 30 seconds of either a wire harness or the rotating room prop, but not worth 90 minutes of boring acting and storyline.",1325635200,5,1182,4.934673366834171
4515864,3,B0050MPUGM,"The film ` Paranormal Activity"" is the obvious inspiration for this film but the makers have localised it to add Indian flavors, they have added some sex without the titillation. Ragini (Kainaz Motivala) and Uday (Raj Kumar Yadav), are getting ready for a rendezvous which involves sex at a friends house outside Mumbai. Ragini does not that Uday has rigged the entire house with cameras and plans to make a sex tape to sell. However things do not go as planned, Obviously and they find themselves under the spell of a vile spirit who plans to keep them in this house forever.
The movie was not scary for me, but only because I watch a lot of horror films. If you have not seen the Paranormal films, you will have the chills. The movie is well made and this considering the low budget is genuinely interesting. Balaji Films are determined to change the economics of film making by making films on shoestring budgets which will show a profit due to their low costs. The cinematography is basically footage from a handicam, but this makes the experience real and scary. The screams and the moments of eerie silence induce genuine chills.
Both leads are outstanding, and the raw dialogue adds to the impact.  I felt that the movie was scary  and a great horror film, although cheesy but since it is path breaking, in the sense that a film of this kind has never been made in Hindi. I genuinely feel that one should have a look at it. Three stars.",1321315200,2,1443,4.546153846153846

8451450,3,B0050MPUGM,"Ok, India isn't known for horror films, but this was surprisingly good. An old school cautionary tale that, by it's own admission, has inspiration in other films and events (think Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, The Ring, etc and the real life Indian MMS scandal). Nonetheless, it delivers some great scares, good visuals, and a story that does carry it for the full 1.5 hours. Worth seeing, would like to see more foreign horror like this one!",1422921600,,446,4.881578947368421
