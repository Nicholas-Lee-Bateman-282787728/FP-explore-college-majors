8312028,1,B001J65R7U,"I'm really disappointed in this dvd.  I own about 6 prenatal dvds and this one is really bad.

The dvd is split into multiple sections.  The stretching intro is fine.  The dvd started to go downhill once we got into the main cardio workout, toning and floor work.  The cardio workout is very simple, and is taught by a non pregnant instructor with second and third trimester models behind her.  Oddly enough, the second trimester modifications are pretty non-existent (the model just does what the instructor does), but worst of all the modifications for the third trimester are ridiculous!  The woman is just told to ""jog in place"" for most of it.

Then I got to the floor segment, and discovered that the majority of it is spent on your back!  The instructor has you lay down on your back (with some pillows if you want) to do flys with weights and leg lifts.  I don't understand how they could release this dvd without knowing the basic rule of don't lay on your back once you are in your second trimester because it can cut off your blood supply. Lifting weights would only make that more likely.

My last issue is that the dvd feels like its a patched together series of tv spots.  Between each segment this random woman comes on the screen and talks about pregnancy for a few minutes. Then the segment begins and the instructor introduces herself and the models again (you get to listen to this 4 times).  I value my time too much to have to stop and ff through this dvd repeatedly.

Don't waste your money like I did.  Try Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness Fix instead for a cardio and toning workout that is VERY respectful of your pregnancy, while being a solid work out.  I'd also recommend The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, or Baby & Mom Yoga.",1245024000,10,1749,4.522292993630574
