1662659,3,B00005TQ04,Grand child liked this.,1193443200,,23,5.0
1662660,5,B00005TQ04,Our kids absolutely love these.  They are very well done and come highly recommended from someone who has bought lots of educational DVDs for my kids over the last 7 years!,1154822400,,172,4.548387096774194
1662661,5,B00005TQ04,"My son is familiar with the World map and the globe and all the seven continents since he was 16 months old. When I learned about this video I immediately purchased it and indeed it's a great complement and supplement to what he's already learned! At 21 months old, he's been around the World vicariously!  His favorite of all places is Timbuktu!!! He keeps asking me to rewind back to the country of Mali to see Timbuktu again (5X !!ugh) Then Turkey and then Nepal! And Egypt! ... I had to play this video about 3 times everyday and even I'm enjoying it! -- and oh he loves Paris when it mentioned the Mona Lisa painting and Artists Monet and Renoir since he's already familiar with them also!",1121472000,2,694,4.421875
1662662,2,B00005TQ04,"When I bought this I was thinking that they would have colorful, real pictures of the places travelled to with animated characters to keep the kids entertained (kind of like National Geographics Geo Kids videos).  I don't think my kids get the full feel of visiting places around the world through all the busy cartoon animation.  Good video, but not what I was expecting.",1111449600,5,372,4.796875
1662663,5,B00005TQ04,"My 2 kids love this DVD. It's animation is well done and the songs are entertaining without being obnoxious. Both my 3 year old and 5 year old enjoyed it and they learned alot of about the world, history, culture, and geography. My 3 year old now knows the 7 continents! This DVD really opened their eyes to travel and all of the amazing things to explore in our world. We can't wait to watch the 2nd DVD, which we just bought.",1099440000,3,427,4.219512195121951
1662664,5,B00005TQ04,"This is a very well-done set of animated pieces about different places around the world.  The animation is very cute, the lyrics are very clever, and the music is enjoyable.  It is not ""dumbed down"" in any way for kids, but there is a lot for them to enjoy in it.  Parents can also learn a little about geography and history, as well!

Our toddler loves to watch it, but it would also be great for getting older kids interested in culture and travel.",1098748800,3,450,4.321428571428571
1662665,5,B00005TQ04,"Finally a fun and engaging series about geography for kids and the rest of us.  All the tunes are catchy, all the locations visited are fascinating, and all the travel guides are charming.  This is so much fun to watch, to sing along with, and to learn about far away places.  I hope this company continues to make these wonderful dvds; I will buy them all.  They would be great for use in classroom instruction, libraries, or simply to view at home.  It's a great way to get kids interested in the world.",1094601600,5,505,4.387096774193548
7953906,5,B00005TQ04,I got this for my classroom and it works great even for middle school students.,1500940800,,79,4.333333333333333
7953907,5,B00005TQ04,The kids love it. At same time they are learning about the history of different parts of the world.. And easy to sing along to.,1467504000,,127,4.12
7953908,5,B00005TQ04,"Great for supplementing your geography studies. Catchy tunes, cute, my son likes them, so I'm happy. :-)",1411171200,,104,5.176470588235294
7953909,5,B00005TQ04,Fun way for children to learn about the different countries. Bought it for the kids but I enjoyed watching it with them. Highly recommend this DVD.,1374019200,,147,4.6923076923076925
7953910,5,B00005TQ04,"If you want to introduce young children to world geography and culture, this WeeBee Tunes Get Your Passport DVD is ideal.  Using high quality music and lovable characters, this DVD takes you to key cities on each of the continents and highlights different aspects of the culture.  This is not an in-depth study of geography but a gentle introduction presented in a manner that will appeal to both children and adults.  I watch this video over and over with my son and am always entertained.",1324684800,,490,4.741176470588235
7953911,4,B00005TQ04,"I bought this for my 6 year old son.  I don't know that it was a great teaching tool, but he did like the videos and they were at least a good review of things we had already covered in our geography studies.  All in all I was pleased with the purchase.",1260144000,,253,3.8461538461538463
7953912,5,B00005TQ04,My son's kindergarten class has this video and the kids love it.  They sing all the songs all the time.  A great education tool on expanding your child's knowledge of the world!,1252886400,,177,4.5
7953913,5,B00005TQ04,"The one reviewer was confused about what is is:  its kind of a Schoolhouse Rock goes on tour.

Its educational and entertaining with catchy tunes.",1237507200,,146,4.8
7953914,5,B00005TQ04,"My children (almost 4 and 5) love this video ""as much as Diego"".  For them that is saying a lot.  I love it because it makes geography fun, introduces the continents, and has delightful songs.  Each continent is represented by a different animal.  The animal takes you on a tour of something on his or her continent.  Sometimes they meet (like in Istanbul) at places that are near or in two continents.  The songs show the flavor of the area.  Some of the places covered are more obscure (the Grand Bazaar) while others are more familiar (London).  I thought there was nice variety.",1204848000,,582,4.58252427184466
7953915,5,B00005TQ04,"I bought this item in hopes to expose my kids to cultures around the world, and they are fascinated. I didn't want anything too detailed or ""boring"" since my kids are still very young. I couldn't have found a better match, my kids sing the songs and tell their stories, now they want to go to the library to learn more about the ""race to the South Pole"".",1193961600,2,354,4.220588235294118
