1656036,5,B00005RIX1,"I actually figured this one out, but not completely, in all the details.  Indeed, I'll challenge anyone to sort out that ""Charlie Foxtrot"".  The basic ""whodunit"" solution is easy enough though.  Great characters and inner story, and subplot between the two detectives.

There is one problem--SLIGHT SPOILER--there is no way a sane human being would use such a knife in committing that murder, pointlessly narrowing the net of suspicion to an immense degree.  Any murder weapon would have done the trick.  If you overlook that, the mystery is rather perfect.  But as it is, it presents a glaring error.",1228176000,,601,5.01010101010101

1656039,5,B00005RIX1,"This dramatization of the Murder On The Links could hardly be any better. The acting is the finest, especially by Hugh Fraser in the character of Hastings. Lots of Agatha Christie fans have rated that story as being one of the best and most touching and the TV adaptation has not let us down. Naturally, as in all Poirot adaptations, lots of details have been changed, modified or added - some things are missing, too. Yet these can't make the movie less good, as it's as though you were getting to know the story all over again. The production is crisp and the settings lavish. All in all, the best of all Poirot mysteries.",1106092800,2,624,4.482456140350878

1656041,5,B00005RIX1,"This is a fine example of David Suchet and Hugh Frasier at their very best.  High drama and poignant, touching moments.  The only thing missing is an appearance by Ms. Lemon and Inspector Japp.
This episode contains some of the best acting of the entire series.  As compelling as my other favorite epsiode - The Chocolate Box.
If you like David Suchet as Poirot - get this video!",1019001600,3,379,4.544117647058823
1656042,4,B00005RIX1,"The show was great. Hasting's pasive agressive personality really comes through here.

1656043,5,B00005RIX1,"I was very clever this time, I had the whole thing figured out fairly early on...or so I thought!  Absolutely nothing is as it seems when Poirot and Hastings take a holiday to a quaint coastal town in France and - shocker - get embroiled in a most puzzling murder.
Most Poirot mysteries have twists, turns, and your classic Christie red herrings, but this episode was extraordinary.  And - not to say too much - this time things hit a little too close to home, and the result is something much more poignant and moving than I had expected.
The scenery is wonderful, the acting as always is top-notch, and for once the perfectly brilliant David Suchet is almost upstaged by Hugh Frasier.
With a diverse cast of characters, a very daring wager with a belligerent French detective, a plot that twists so much it makes your head spin, and an ending that just makes you want to stand up and applaud, this is Poirot (and Hastings) at their absolute best.
Almost as good as The ABC Murders.  And that says a great deal!",1017360000,8,1012,4.489130434782608
1656044,5,B00005RIX1,"<Murder on the Links>  This is it! The last of the longer Poirot mysteries is now available on DVD and VHS formats (as are the last three of the shorter ones on VHS), thereby completing the Acorn Media releases of the entire series (except for those later ones issued on the A&E label).
Although the acting is (as almost always in this series) superb, the solution itself does stretch credulity a little too much. The ""crowded murder scene"" is a standard of many mysteries as is the ""But I thought YOU did it"" situation in which characters cover for other characters and false confessions are rife.

 Christie also strains things a bit by having one set of characters repeat a setup done a decade earlier by another set of characters--I am trying not to give too much away by naming any of them--and hoping that certain parties would be fooled by the ruse. At least the real murderer does come as something of a surprise.
 What adds spice to this story is the subplot of an egotistical French detective whose motto is ""I am never wrong"" betting his famous pipe against Poirot's mustache. And for once, good old Hastings is not only attracted to a femme fatale but actually ends up in love with her--and she with him.

So all in all, this episode is a good deal of fun without too much padding as sometimes is the case in the longer episodes.",1016928000,7,1341,4.502057613168724

It .looks great, as usual, but there are a couple of really bad performances in it which let it down. It feels labored and not as well written or directed as the others.

7952548,5,B00005RIX1,"""Murder on the Links"" is a feature-length episode from ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" Series 6, which originally aired on Britain's ITV in 1996. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) and Capt. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) are vacationing in Deauville, France, where Poirot looks forward to the cuisine and Hastings to the golf. One evening, as Hastings is transfixed by the pretty chanteuse (Jacinta Mulcahy), the man who owns the resort, Paul Renauld (Damien Thomas), approaches Poirot to ask his assistance. But before they can visit Renauld the next day, he is abducted from his home and found murdered on the golf course, a knife in his back. France's greatest detective, Giraud ""The Pipe"" (Bill Moody) is on the case and wagers that he can find the killer before the Belgian does.

Agatha Christie's novel ""Murder on the Links"" was published in 1923, but this film has been moved to 1936 in keeping with the television series' chronology. The key to solving the mystery is in a crime from the past, which is not unusual in Christie's stories. But this one may be unique in that Capt. Hastings tries to cover up for a murder suspect with whom he is smitten. It's not clear how the audience is supposed to take that. It's unethical and potentially disastrous, not traits I usually associate with Capt. Hastings. The blustery, boorish Giraud provides some colorful competition for Poirot.  And there is plenty of humor to be found in the dapper detective's juxtaposition with the more athletic tourists. ""Murder on the Links"" has high entertainment value.

The DVD (Acorn 2002): The disc includes the usual Collector's Set bonus features -a text interview with David Suchet, a brief Agatha Christie bio, a list of Poirot books. It also has selective filmographies for 4 members of the cast, 10 Poirot trivia questions with answers, a ""Who's Played Poirot?"" essay, and 4 Poirot quotes. No subtitles.",1309651200,,1882,4.987261146496815
7952549,5,B00005RIX1,"David Suchet is the perfect Poirot!  I've read all of Agatha Christie's Poirot novels and Suchet fits him to the T!!  Suchet's Poirot mannerisms are so unique I never tire of seeing him in this character!  I have several of the TV episodes on dvd as well as some of the hour long features.  They are all wonderful!  Character, plot and dialog are sooo much more interesting than gore and explosions presented as entertainment in so many American films.  Poirot is a welcome treat for the senses!",1262649600,,495,4.632183908045977
