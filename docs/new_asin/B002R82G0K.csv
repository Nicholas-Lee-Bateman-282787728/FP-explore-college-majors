8378450,5,B002R82G0K,"I have been shooting and studying shooting for many years.  If you are new to all of the controversy, this program will save you an awful lot of time. You won't be sifting through minutiae to find the essentials for effective close contact shooting. They are all right here. That way you won't get caught in the Weaver vs. Isoceles argument, stress over the fact that you have not mastered the surprise trigger break, or engage in unrealistic training. Get it, watch it, then practice.  You will shoot better.",1334534400,,509,4.707865168539326
