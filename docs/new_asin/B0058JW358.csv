8461690,3,B0058JW358,"Because I'm familiar with the old 33 1/3 lp of this oratorio starring Vera Zorina, both in English and French, and because I've seen two productions of the piece, and because I grew up admiring Ingrid Bergman in her films, I've ached to get a copy of this film which has been unavailable up until now. But I have to admit I'm very disappointed in it, mainly because Ms. Bergman's performance is way below anything I've seen her do previously. As she was wonderful in the film of ""Saint Joan,"" I was anticipating some of that fine performance in ""Joan of Arc at the Stake""...and didn't get it. I'm also disappointed in Rossellini's direction. It seems (to me) awkward and stilted. I always try to fairly note in these reviews that appreciation of anything performed is in the eye (and taste) of the viewer (or listener). This film will probably be perceived much more interestingly by those who are unfamiliar with other performances. So I urge others to give it a try, if for nothing other than to acquire an acquaintance with an extraordinary piece of writing, both the fine manuscript and the marvelous music.",1461715200,,1111,4.702564102564103

8461694,3,B0058JW358,"This seems like a fascinating idea - Bergman! Rossellini! Joan of arc! A movie that is really theatre!  But in the end it was close to unwatchable.

How about releasing acts of the apostles? Now That's an unknown r movie worth releasing on dvd",1415577600,,243,4.5
8461695,4,B0058JW358,"This film challenges us to set aside the spiritual accounts of Joan's death at the stake. Ultimately, It is a work of art, meaning that we must go along with the symbolism and the unique vision of the director. Roberto Rossellini clearly put his stamp on the production. We are fortunate to have this performance by Ingrid Bergman. Until recently, I did not know the work existed on film. Roberto Rossellini infuses his interpretation with a spiritual ambiguity that is not consistent with the simple faith of Joan the maid. In Bergman's 1948 film, Joan of Arc, Joan dies crying out the name of Jesus three times. I suspect that in her husband's film, despite his secular interpretation, Ingrid Bergman still held her belief in Joan's spiritual commitment in her heart, silently rejecting her husband's intellectualization of Joan's final moments at the stake. All else aside, Miss Bergman's stellar performance far overshadows any critical bickering about Rossellini's interpretation of the work. As always, Bergman's spiritual depth triumphs.",1373760000,4,1044,5.25748502994012
