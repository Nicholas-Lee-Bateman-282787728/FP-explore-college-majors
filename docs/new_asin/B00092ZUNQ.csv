Actually, as a bible enthusiast, I have lectured to groups on this topic but it would take up too much space to discuss it here.  Nevertheless, one very ""interesting"" take on Noah is this little known film that updates the story.

The French title for the film is the ""Prophecy of the Frogs"" - and the amphibians figure prominently in the beginning of the picture.  (Think about it - frogs are disappearing from our natural environments, so they are indirectly giving us a very real warning of a global weather disaster.) In this cartoon, the frogs tell a boy and girl of their scientific findings: the world will be flooded for 40 days and 40 nights.  Sound familiar?

Yes, the family is saved but, as it happens, they are the temporary custodians of a zoo - so all the animals join them in the ark.  Problems, problems, problems. Although the Noah character - Ferdinand - brings tons of potatoes into the ark, the carnivores hungrily eye the chickens and the pigs and the other animals as food. Potatoes simply will not do.  Ferdinand's message of peace is that all must learn to live together. He tells the animals that violence means the end for all life.  But not all the animals see it that way...there are some truly frightening images. Caveat: this is not a film for children under the age of 6.

I liked this version of Noah, even though the Bible message is simplified. On the plus side, the film has moments of tremendous visual beauty. Another plus is that Ferdinand carries a guitar and sings beautiful, even moving folk songs to all the animals.

The animation is beautiful, and the DVD does it justice. It's just like being in the big theater again!

The plot doesn't get old and it's a healthy dose of reality combined with fantasy combined with timeless classic theme of loving those close to you, recognizing good and evil, and dealing with misconceptions.

I haven't popped in the DVD per se, but I saw this film in theaters and loved it! This is exactly what Western animation is missing!",1193097600,,668,4.741379310344827
