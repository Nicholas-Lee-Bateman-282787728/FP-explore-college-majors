2115878,4,B0002Q9VD4,"D.O.A. long ago was allowed to slip into the public domain. It stars character actor Edmund O'Brien (check him out as Dutton Peabody in John Ford's 1962 classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MAN-WHO-SHOT-LIBERTY-VALANCE/dp/B00005ASGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE</a>&nbsp;or as Vic Pardo in Jimmy Cagney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHITE-HEAT/dp/B0006HBV3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHITE HEAT</a>, from '49).

Here, O'Brien is a rather nondescript accountant who's slipped an irradiated drink at a tavern. The lethal poison has no antidote, but it's so slow-acting that O'Brien is given a chance to investigate who wants him dead, and maybe to exact revenge. A truly sad story, for the man's fate is sealed at the outset, yet we root for him every step of the way as he confronts psycho baddie Neville Brand (see product's cover) and follows false trails. This is truly one of the best of the film noir genre, and is highly recommended!

In the Poverty Row melodrama HELL'S HOUSE, a naiv&eacute; kid is sent to reform school for not infoming on a cowardly bootlegger that he admires. Conditions at the mismanaged juvenile facility are deplorable and corporal punishment for the least infraction too common. Jimmy's best friend in ""stir,"" a sickly boy nicknamed ""Shorty"" (Coghlan Jr.), nearly dies from confinement in a walk-in cold storage room, so Jimmy escapes to get help for the boy. He turns to charismatic but phony Kelly, his imagined friend, but only when newspaperman Frank Gebhardt (Wallace) calls Kelly a ""rat"" does he finally do what's right.

CAST NOTES--
Miss Davis is listed as star but hers is a supporting role. The lead is actually young Durkin. Bette's acting is amateurish (especially in comparison to her later triumphs) in the role of Peggy Gardner, but O'Brien plays a great schnook as bootlegger Matt Kelly.

Junior Durkin was Huck Finn in two circa 1930 PARAMOUNT films. Three years after ""Hell's House"" was completed, he died in a car accident that also killed Jackie Coogan's dad and injured Jackie. At the time, Junior was living with agent Henry Wilson, an ""admirer"" of male pulchritude. Wilson later discovered, mentored (perhaps bedded) and renamed Rock Hudson, Troy Donahue and Tab Hunter.

Unlike his ill-fated 'Shorty' of this story, Frank Coughlin Jr. lived long, dying at age 83.

2115879,4,B0002Q9VD4,"A young Bette Davis, the struggling actress was trying to make it in Hollywood.

Close to being terminated by Universal Studios a year prior, fortunately she was defended by cinematographer Karl Freund and was given a chance to be in a motion picture.

Davis would make her debut in ""The Bad Sister"" and would star in a few other films in 1931, but nothing that the actress could capitalize on.  But Universal Studios renewed her contract for three more months and lent out to various movie companies.

In 1932, she was lent to B.F. Zeidman Productions Ltd. for the movie ""Hell's House"" which would be directed by silent film director Howard Higgen and would star Bette Davis, Pat O'Brien (who would later star in the James Cagney film ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" and the Ronald Reagan film ""Knute Rockne All American"") and would star teen actor Junior Durkin (who would play Huckleberry Finn in ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Huckleberry Finn"") as the main protagonist Jimmy..

While the pre-code, low-budget film was not a box office hit, it is one of the few very early Bette Davis films that is in good condition and was shot during the latter years of the Prohibition Era.

And now ""Hell's House"" which was mastered in HD from an original 35 mm print from Bette Davis's personal collection (and was donated to the Library of Congress), will be released for the first time on Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.

The Blu-ray was released on June 2013 with another Blu-ray release for an early Bette Davis film titled ""Of Human Bondage"" (1934).

VIDEO:

""Hell's House"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and in black and white. It's important to remember that ""Hell's House"" is an older video filmed in the combustible nitrate that silent films were shot.  While the picture quality for the film is very good for its age, it's important to note that the first reel of the print from which the master was derived from, suffers from nitrate decomposition and some missing frames.  But the film is essentially intact.

While not pristine, considering that many silent films do not look perfect and some surviving films suffer from nitrate damage, for ""Hell's House"", it's not the type of damage that prevents you from enjoying the film.  There are no black decomposition showing up throughout the beginning of the film, if anything, the film looks much better than I thought it would be.  Grays and whites are well contrast, black levels look good and while there are some white specks, this is probably one of the better 1932 films I have seen on Blu-ray.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Hell's House"" is presented in LPCM 1.0 monaural.  Dialogue was clear and dialogue was not difficult to understand whatsoever.  I don't recall hearing any significant hissing, cracks or pops during my viewing of the film but for the most part, I was quite pleased by the lossless soundtrack and that it was not terrible, tinny, nor did it feature a lot of hiss.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Hell's House"" features no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a cinema fan, for any Bette Davis follower, trying to collect her films, especially earlier films, will learn quickly that they are not as easy to find.  And when you do find some of them, the quality of the print and audio are bad.

So, when I found out that Kino Lorber was releasing two Bette Davis films on Blu-ray, I was surprised because I wasn't aware that her earlier films were in good enough quality to be released on Blu-ray, considering that Kino Lorber has a strict guideline of what films would receive the Blu-ray treatment.

But finding out that ""Hell's House"" was mastered in HD from an original 35 mm print from Bette Davis's personal collection that was donated to the Library of Congress, I was enthusiastic.

Why the excitement?  Well, I am aware that ""Hell's House"" is not considered one of Bette Davis' major films.  Afterall, she's not a supporting character and it's protagonist is a teenage boy.

But what I enjoyed about this film is the fact that it deals with a story about corruption in a reform school (which usually doesn't get made, unless there was actual problems of that era), it dealt with a major problem with bootlegging, but also you have three talents that would be well-known for certain reasons.

Bette Davis of course would become a legendary star, years after this film.  But it's hard to imagine that at the time of this film, she was close to losing her job and the films she did star in, she wasn't getting any significant notice by it.  But Bette Davis definitely shows the audience promise with her beauty and style in this film alone.

While Pat O'Brien, who may not be a legendary movie star, but has appeared in nearly a hundred films such as ""Angels with Dirty Faces"", ""Knute Rockne All American"" and ""Riffraf"".  But similar to Bette Davis, his role in ""Hell's House"" very early in his career.

And as for young actor Junior Durkin, while playing the role of Huckleberry Finn in ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Huckleberry Finn"", ""Hell's House"" was a major film in his career and he was becoming groomed by RKO Pictures for major work right after.  But unfortunately, three years later, the day before Durkin's film ""Chasing Yesterday"" was to open in theaters and he would now go by the name ""Trent"" instead of Junior, Durkin would be killed in a car accident in San Diego along with John Coogan Sr., producer Robert J. Horner and the driver of the vehicle who had lost control.  The only survivor of the car accident was his best friend Jackie Coogan (known for his role as ""The Kid"" in the Charlie Chaplin film and later as Uncle Fester in ""The Addam's Family"" but also responsible for the ""Child Actor's Bill"" in California).

But there is another reason why the film is rather interesting.  For many Bette Davis fans who watched the film on television, some have blogged about their experience watching this film.  While a pre-code drama, those who have watched the film also claim the film has homoerotic tones between the characters of Jimmy and his good friend Shorty.

Personally, I never saw it that way.  I thought of the two characters almost like best friends, brothers who watched each other's back.  And if there was any affection from Jimmy towards Shorty, it was more of how close they were as friends in prison.  But I never saw it as the two were gay or the story was homoerotic.  But then again, any friendship between young males have been seen and blogged by few viewers as being gay  (ie. Frodo and Sam for ""The Lord of the Rings"").

The film is also an early Hollywood film that touches upon corruption and abuse in reform schools.  And what is interesting about this is the fact that a film goes to show how children were mistreated.  But fast forward to 2013, and many of these kids who were in reform schools during the 30s through the 60s have come forward to talk about the abuse they suffered.  And these stories such as the recent Florida's Dozier School for Boys news or even the terrible news of reform schools overseas especially in Ireland are still appearing in the news.  It makes me wonder if writer/director Howard Higgin had a mission to let audiences know of problems in the system.

The only pre-code element that I have felt the film may have contained is the bootlegging and moral dilemma.  But nothing too serious and no one is seen murdering or doing drugs in this film, so it's pretty tame when it comes to films of that era.

If anything, ""Hell's House"" gives people a glimpse of an actress before she became a legendary star, a glimpse of an actor who would have a long career in film and television and a glimpse of a young actor who was destined to become something bigger but died at a young age.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality for this film was much better than I expected considering it's 81-years-old.  Audio is clear and despite the nitrate decomposition of the first reel, it didn't make me flinch or even made me think that there were problems.  Unfortunately, there are no special features included with this Blu-ray release.

""Hell's House"" is a pre-code, early Hollywood film featuring the early film appearances of Bette Davis and Pat O'Brien.  It's a rarity to find an early '30s film shot on nitrate in good shape but also to receive a Blu-ray treatment.  Overall, an enjoyable moralistic '30s drama and a Blu-ray release that I recommend not just for fans of the talents in the film, but also fans who want to see more early Hollywood cinema on Blu-ray!

2115884,5,B0002Q9VD4,"This early Bette Davis movie is about graft and corruption in a boys reformatory. This fictional piece probably described many such places of the time and could have been an attempt of passive agressive exposure by the author. Pat O'Brien plays a slick bootlegger with a quirky sense of humor. He also is a master of some very lame magic tricks, is a braggart and name dropper. He does not know any of the people whose names he drops. He is a sharp dresser and afficianado of one liners. When he gets a bit fresh with Bette, he quips, ""I just washed my hands and can't do a thing with them!"" He suckers a poor recently orphaned 15 year old boy who worships him and needs a job into becoming a part of his bootlegging operation with the promise of big bucks. The catch is that he must not tell anyone of their association or name any names if there is any trouble.  The kid, played by Jr. Durkin has no idea he is involved in anything illegal, he is that naive. He is then apprehended and sent to the reformatory, divulging nothing. He had the chance to go free if he would name names and refuses, convinced that the bootlegger will find a way to spring him quickly. Instead, he spends three years in the place in almost unbearable conditions and worse, he witnesses horrible cruelty perpetrated against the friends he has made there. A newspaper man knows of the corruption but can't prove it. He tells the warden to come clean, to save the lives of young men, but he won't. Meanwhile the young man escapes in a food barrel for the sole reason of getting medical help for a dying friend in the reformatory. Ms. Davis has offered her friendship to the boy before so he winds up on her doorstep with his sad tale. She is determined to make things right, so she coerces her bootlegger beau to spill his guts to the newspaper editor. He can't without implicating himself. The editor uses emotional blackmail to get him to finally take the fall and the young boy does not have to return to the reformatory. The editor blows the lid off the reformatory conditions and the ensuing headlines cause investigations. Ms. Davis, very young, very beautiful and kinda blonde has a very minor role, but she steals the show. Her fur- trimmed outfit is to die for. Jr. Durkin is great as is his charming little friend, ""Shorty.""",1252713600,2,2311,4.476303317535545
2115885,3,B0002Q9VD4,"Undistinguished, yet a perfectly watchable depression/prohibition-era melodrama set mostly in a workhouse for delinquent kids.  For those Bette Davis fans out there, yes, Bette Davis is in this movie, but it by no means a ""Bette Davis movie"".  Ms. Davis plays the girlfriend of a bootlegger, but doesn't get to do much besides show that she has the conscience her boyfriend lacks (until the unlikely conclusion where the bootlegger all of a sudden feels guilt for those he ground under his boots on the way up).  She's also not onscreen much, with most of the running time being devoted to a misguided kid trying to make his way in the workhouse after he refuses to dime out his bottlegger boss.

All in all, this churned-out, second-tier melodrama is a fairly painless stopover for Bette Davis completists.  The movie is only 72 minutes long, the print isn't bad (though it's not sharp and restored, by any means), and there's a nice gallery of other vintage-era DVD offerings to scroll through, which mostly feature original movie poster art on the DVD boxes pictured.",1181606400,8,1070,4.889502762430939

Little does he realize that O'Brien has eyes for his girlfriend, Bette Davis. When the bootlegger's joint gets raided and Durkin is arrested, he refuses to rat out O'Brien and the kid is sent to reform school for three years. Here the boy is cruelly mistreated; when another boy at the school dies, a newspaper threatens to expose what's going on (that's the reform angle). When Durkin finds out from his mother that O'Brien and Davis are a number, he escapes and pays a visit to Davis. She feeds him the line that she was only doing it to get O'Brien to spring him. Then when the cops show up on Durkin's tail, O'Brien confesses. It's a pretty unbelievable ending, and the picture is not very memorable.

2115895,2,B0002Q9VD4,"Hell's House (Howard Higgin, 1932)

Hell's House still exists in the public consciousness solely because of Bette Davis. That's a literal statementthe movie was thought lost for years, until Davis passed away and her personal film collection was donated to the National Archives; a copy of Hell's House was discovered therein. It was Davis' sixth feature, made when she was still in her early twenties (all five of her previous features were made in 1931); it was also co-lead Pat O'Brien's sixth. But both of these big-name stars pale in comparison, in this potboiler, to the movie's real star, Junior Durkin. Durkin is very little remembered these days thanks to his untimely death in a 1935 road accident (he was only nineteen years old), but he was big business in the early thirties; his very little screen output included playing Huck Finn in both Tom Sawyer (1930) and Huckleberry Finn (1931) and Franz in Phil Rosen's 1934 adaptation of Little Men. While Hell's House is a potboiler, and Davis and O'Brien give it about the treatment it deserves, Durkin throws himself into the role in a way one rarely sees in movies like this. I mean, we're talking Edward-G-Robinson-in-Scarface here.

Plot: O'Brien plays Matt Kelly, a bootlegger in the days when that was a profitable business. Durkin plays Jimmy, one of Kelly's hangers-on. After a job gone bad, Jimmy gets nabbed for a minor crime Kelly committed. After refusing to snitch, Jimmy is sent to a reform school that make the conditions on the Island of Doomed Men seem downright hospitable. While there, he befriends Shorty (the great character actor Frank Coughlin Jr. in one of his few credited roles), who has a heart condition exacerbated by the brutal treatment he receives there. Once Jimmy gets out, he enlists Kelly and Kelly's girlfriend Peggy (Davis)  to help spread the word about the deplorable reform school and bring its tyrant of a headmaster (James A. Marcus, another often-uncredited character actor) to justice.

Yes, it's a genre thriller, predictable and manipulative, an otherwise forgettable product of its time save the fame its two leads would go onto and the once-in-a-lifetime performance given by a child star whose ascent to fame was cruelly ended. But those things make it interesting, at least, as a piece of cinematic history; if you're a student of the early days of film, it's worth checking out on that angle. Others can take it or leave it as they will. **",1407888000,,2451,4.927360774818402
