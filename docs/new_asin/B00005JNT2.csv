1526954,3,B00005JNT2,"This fun little romp is full of hits and misses.  That may be, in part, that Tommy Lee Jones just isn't ready for outright comedy-let alone one that could also be called a ""chick-flick.""  But then the awkwardness of his character also almost works.

Tommy Lee Jones plays Texas Ranger Roland Sharp (doesn't he always seem to play a lawman?).  Well, Sharp is a lawman with a teenage daughter that he's lucky if he sees once a month-mainly because he doesn't know how to relate to her.  But that's all about to change.

While trying to subpoena a witness, Sharp and his Rangers come under fire, and their witness escapes, only to be murdered in an ally a few blocks away.  But looking down at the murder from a bathroom window are five cheerleaders from Texas State University.  Now in order to keep them from getting killed, Sharp must move in with them, and go undercover as their cheerleading coach.

Director Stephen Herek (Mr. Holland's Opus; Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) has done a fair job of weaving a bit of hard-core action into light, fluffy, ""chick-flick,"" romantic comedy.  But at times, the action seems to be present more the guys that would be dragged to this film by their girlfriends or just to see Tommy Lee Jones with five beautiful cheerleaders.

However, Herek was fresh in using a very interesting ""multi-screen"" technique to present the opening credits.  Inter-cut with full-screen shots Herek had an image in one corner and a second in the opposite while having the credits appear in the spaces in-between.  Each of images presented us with different perspectives of a scene.  One image showed what Sharp was doing, while the other showed the witness he was trying to subpoena.

Jones (MIB; The Fugitive; Space Cowboys) has always seemed to have a natural comical sense in whatever he does as he has uttered some of the greatest one-liners in Hollywood history.  But that seems to be where his comical talents lie-bringing light humor to brighten dark scenes.  This movie was so light to begin with, that his humor, in places, had the opposite effect.  Still the writers did their best to work in a few dark scenes for his humor to brighten.

Cedric the Entertainer (Barber Shop movies; Ice Age) played an ex-convict turned minister (not to mention a Texas State Alum) and pretty much stole every scene he was in-be it running away from Sharp or showing off his cheerleading dance steps.

Anne Archer (Patriot Games; Clear and Present Danger) had a bit of a minor role as the English teacher that Sharp falls for.  Her character, at times though, just seemed a little awkward.

Brian Van Holt (Black Hawk Down; S.W.A.T.) played the dirty FBI agent trying to find out where Sharp was hiding his witnesses.  Kind of a clichd textbook character, and there was nothing really special about the way Van Holt played him.

Shannon Marie Woodward had the role of Sharp's estranged daughter.  For a minor role it was actually quite a difficult one.  Wanting her daddy's love, but unsure whether her father loved her back as he was always busy with a case and saw even less of her since he and her mom got divorced.  Woodward was a little wooden in the part but handled it well overall.

This film is definitely worth a few really good laughs mixed in with a lot of chuckles.  As for actually paying to see it on the silver screen, decide how much you like the actors or the premise.  Certainly the opening multi-screen sequence is probably best viewed on the big screen, but the rest of the film is a far cry from a ""must-see.""",1109462400,2,3546,4.663446054750403
1526955,3,B00005JNT2,"There's an old clich that a movie is funny when it puts two vastly different people (or groups of people) together for the majority of it's screen time.  For the most part, this works pretty well (that's why it got to be a clich), but there are occasional stinkers.  ""Man of the House"", which puts Tommy Lee Jones together with a bunch of cheerleaders, is somewhere in between: Not a hit, but still a worthy effort.

 Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) is a very tough, serious guy.  He has to be: he's a Texas Ranger after all, the elite of Texas law enforcement.  He's on a dangerous case when, through a suspenseful, action-packed pursuit, the shady character he's trying to get to testify is shot dead by a mysterious assassin, and the only witnesses are five college cheerleaders.  Now Sharp must protect these girls from the assassin, so they can finger him.  Sure, the plot's a bit thin, with holes in places, but it's a comedy, right?  We're lucky there's a plot at all.

 But perhaps labeling this film as a ""comedy"" is a bit inaccurate.  This is one of those movies with an identity crisis: it doesn't seem to know if it's a goofy comedy about a stuffy old guy living with a bunch of peppy college chicks, or a dramatic suspense flick complete with explosions, car chases, and cold-blooded murder.  Most films would fall all to pieces with this kind of schizophrenic plotline, but it is a testament to Tommy Lee Jones' acting ability that he can be a tough action hero AND a straightman with a quip or two.

 Unfortunately for the comedy portion, most, if not all, of the best parts were given away in the trailers.  This is a common occurrence for comedies; most advertising departments seem to think it is necessary to make the trailer wall-to-wall laughs rather than surprise us by making a U-turn from dramatic to hilarious (though I have seen a trailer or two do this).

 The dramatic parts of this film are actually pretty good.  Sharp, a divorcee, learns to show his love for his daughter Emma (Shannon Marie Woodward) thanks to his cheerleader witnesses, and even has a romantic interest with Molly McCarthy (Anne Archer).  For a film that is mostly a comedy, these dramatic elements are handled nicely and appropriately.

  Cedric the Entertainer, as you probably already know, is also in ""Man of the House"" though his role as a rather unscrupulous gospel church minister isn't nearly large enough to warrant him next-to-top billing.

Another thing:  the cheerleaders in ""Man of the House"" are the most stereotypical pompom shakers I have ever seen.  Poor Roland is faced with all the problems faced by anyone dealing with cheerleaders in CinemaLand: getting them unglued from cell phones, boyfriends, and pop music, as well as dealing with... um... other girl things.

 Speaking of which, in case you were wondering: yes, these girls are gorgeous, and, well, most of the time they don't wear much.  But you'd have to be pretty shallow to go see this movie just for THAT.",1109376000,2,2986,4.710424710424711

1527578,5,B00005JNT2,"Man of the House (2005) stars Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas Ranger whos assigned to protect five cheerleaders of the University of Texas after they witness a murder. He masquerades as a cheerleading coach while living at the girls sorority house. Anne Archer is on hand as a possible love interest and Cedric the Entertainer has a fun role.

While this is a relatively unknown movie, it cost a whopping $40 million, but only made back half at the USA box office. As such, it may be obscure, but its highly polished. The question is, is it a gem or a piece of you know what?

Im giving Man of the House a relatively high rating because it pretty much gives you everything youd want in a dramedy/thriller. The action scenes may be unrealistic, as well as some of the comedy, but the drama generally smacks of real life. If you can get past the yeah, right action scenes of the opening act the movie settles down into a worthy dramedy where you get to know the characters and care about their outcome. When the lives of the girls are ultimately threatened, for instance, its suspenseful simply because you care about them by that point. At first, though, they come off stereotypical and shallow, but this changes over the course of the movie.

Speaking of the cheerleaders, the filmmakers came up with an excellent assortment of actresses. The variety is good because every male watching will find at least one that trips his trigger. For me, its Kelli Garner as Barb, but they each have their positive aspects. The others are played by Christina Milian, Paula Garcs, Monica Keena and Vanessa Ferlito. The latter plays the no-nonsense brunette who has a couple of discussions with Jones character. While the actors do fine in these scenes, the filmmakers needed to work the kinks out in the writing. There are also some more yeah, right scenes at the end when the girls join the action, but this comes with the territory of this kind of movie.

The bottom line is that Man of the House delivers the goods for a dramedy/thriller. Jones is a strong fish-out-of-water protagonist and Archer shines in her small role. The girls are cuties and the story captures your attention. I also appreciate the lack of raunch, not to mention the warmth that starts to surface in the relationships.  For instance, Keenas character says something to Garners character a little past the hour mark and it reveals something touching about Barb that was barely implied up to that point.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Austin, Texas, and Santa Clarita, California.

1527673,4,B00005JNT2,"Being re-released to DVD today from Mill Creek Entertainment is the 2005 comedy Man Of The House. The film was directed by Stephen Herek and stars Tommy Lee Jones. There are no special features or extras on the single-disc DVD.

Man Of The House centers on a group of college cheerleaders, Heather (played by Vanessa Ferlito), Evie (played by Monica Keena), Barb (played by Kelli Garner), Anne (played by Christina Milian) and Teresa (played by Paula Garc&eacute;s), whom witness a murder. The girls are brought to the local police station to take their statements, but the all have different descriptions of the shooter. With no other choice, Texas Ranger Roland Sharp (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is assigned to watch over the cheerleaders just in case the murderer attempts to harm them.

Of course Ranger Sharp doesn't get along with the five young woman, especially since he is living with them. All the girls want to do is party and prepare theor cheerleading skills for the next home-game, but all Ranger Sharp wants them to do is to stay in their house. This way it is easier for him to protect them. He wasn't planning on the cheerleaders trying to rebel against, attempting to steal his pizza, wearing clothes around the house that shows way too much skin and interfering with his relationship with his estranged daughter  Emma (played by Shannon Marie Woodward). The cheerleaders even try to help him on his date with the English teacher, Molly (played by Anne Archer.

While Ranger Sharp is being distracted by trying to protect the cheerleaders, the murderer is getting closer and closer to finding their location.

Well, I can't believe that this film is already ten-years-old as I recall renting it on VHS (Remember those) at my local video store that is now kaput. Don't get confused with the 1995 film with the same name with Chevy Chase as this film stars Tommy Lee Jones, a Texas Ranger that is assigned to protect five cheerleaders. No, the film didn't win any awards, but in my opinion it is an underrated comedy that is worth a second look. This is a DVD re-release, so there are no special features or bonus features on the single disc. Overall, Man Of The House is a hilarious comedy from start to finish that I recommend to others.

1527920,5,B00005JNT2,"What a find!  I stumbled across this movie and will be recommending it to my friends.  Tommy Lee Jones is funny as the deadpan Texas Ranger charged with protecting five cheerleaders who witness a murder.  The characters are well-developed, so you really care about them.  It was fun to see the relationship develop between Tommy Lee Jones and the cheerleaders.  Anne Archer is winning as the love interest, an English professor who teaches one of the cheerleaders.  The story development was genuinely surprising, so the suspense really worked.",1403827200,,544,5.125

1527923,4,B00005JNT2,"This movie is a lot of fun, Tommy Lee Jones is as always at his best, although it could be said that this movie is not his best, and is also most certainly not his worst movie, but it is a movie that is just plain fun. The story is one that has been told many times yet, Jones gives it his own personal twist and a different kind of comedy, kind of the old deadpan one liners, but it works. The characters are interesting especially Cedric the entertainer and his cow. It is neither a fast movie nor is it a slow one, but just about right for this type of film. I would without reservation Recommend this movie",1402617600,,610,4.091666666666667

But in the movies, good people can forgive a lot of sins.  Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas Ranger is quintessential.  Anne Archer and Cedric are pros in small but significant roles.  Finally, the young ladies, the five cheerleaders and Tommy's daughter, are adorable.  We get to know each a little bit, and by the end of the picture, I couldn't get enough of them.

But they do put more clothes on. All sort of things happen with these girls and Tommy Lee. They even try to help him with a date. This is a good movie.,1394150400,,497,4.134020618556701

1527999,4,B00005JNT2,"Who better to play a competent Texas Ranger...why, Tommy Lee Jones.  And the role fits Mr. Jones like an old, beloved, reliable shirt.  And that lends a sense of credibility to this film's rather far-fetched plot of the Texas Rangers needing to protect five university cheerleaders who witnessed a murder...I think that only works out in certain fantasies.  Anyway, this film balances Mr. Jones' gruff demeaner (does he trademark that or something) with it's light-hearted humor and out-there antics.  While this work isn't deep or thought-provoking in any way, it is certainly hilarious and entertaining.  Also, the film's score is quite catchy and I've been unable to find a soundtrack recording out there (I'm not sure there is one, but I can dream...)  I will say that having the real-life Governor of Texas appearing in the film as himself does not make this plot any more credible.  In fact, the Governor relaying the protection assignment actually lowers the credibility for me no matter how connected the cheerleaders' fathers seem to be.  I will reccomend this to anyone looking for some light-hearted, funny entertainment with some action and a good score and a great leading man.  Enjoy.

P.S.:  A special shoutout to the University of Texas at Austin, who for the first time allowed any sort of filming to be done on their campus and allowed their name and related associations and traditions to be used.  That did lend the film some serious credibility.  Thank you, Longhorns!",1387756800,,1489,5.004065040650406

It is advertised here at Amazon as being 1.33:1. In case you don't know that is edited to fit old stle TVs or 'fullscreen', which cuts a 1/3 (approximately) of the movie from the far left and right of the feature to eliminate the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. NOT ACCEPTABLE! Any way after getting no help from Amazon nor the the store who had it on the aspect ratio, I took my business to another company and there the same movie show as being produced in both 1.33:1 and 2.40:1. I went back to Amazon and goHastings (the seller I always use because of their superb ratings and immediate refund if not happy policy) to explaine what I had found out about the double aspect ratios on the same disc to see if they could verify if it was true. Amazon dropped the ball by telling me to contact goHastings and goHastings dropped the ball by just saying they could not check for me but would refund if it wasn't what I wanted. That's why I use them. I tried again to go to the 'update product info' for the feature once I received it and found that it was indeed in both fullscreen 1.33:1 and widescreen 2.40:1 as described else where on line, but there was no way to accomplish this simply because their are no options for the correction and you can't leave any notes about this there so it is still wrong at Amazon.

A paper bag made out of toilet paper.

Single-ply.

I mean, what the shiznit! He plays the exact same role in every movie. The stoic tough guy with an attitude and Wranglers that are a whisper too tight. You know what I'm talking about.

The story deals with Tommy Lee Jones protecting his witnesses of a murder from the bad guys, just that these witnesses are cheerleaders! So Jones is in his element as the unemotional and super-stiff cop, in charge of a bunch of bubbly teenagers. A slightly sad part about this movie is that it touches some interesting themes and characters, but does little in completely realising the potential of these characters or the complexity of their interplay. But there are loads of situations where there is wonderful humor, accentuated by the contrasting cast!
The plot has several holes and honestly is not really gripping, with too many side threads grabbing attention, but then this is one movie to be seen with an open mind and with the intent of enjoying the light hearted comedy that it is! Definitely watchable.",1156118400,3,882,4.847682119205298
1528516,3,B00005JNT2,"One dead serious Texas Ranger played by Tommy Lee Jones must protect the five witnesses for the prosecution. And the five witnesses happen to be unruly and bubbly cheerleaders of the Texas University. The story sounds thin and weak, and actually it is much weaker than that of Whoopie Goldberg's hit movie `Sister Act,' but thanks to the dead-pan humor of Tommy Lee Jones, `Man of the House' manages to be an OK entertainment.

From the not-so-great opening including one now stale `cow humiliation' gag, you know the film itself does not take itself seriously. The blend of actions and comedy does not go well, especially when we see embarrassed Cedric the Entertainer holding a very, very dirty cell phone in his hand, and some cardboard characters getting killed in the alley.

The film gets better when it introduces the five cheerleaders. The dialogues exchanged between Tommy Lee Jones' Texas Ranger and the cheerleaders (who just want to have fun even after witnessing killing!) are not particularly witty, some based on the typical wrong idea that cheerleaders are not bright, but still work with Tommy Lee Jones' comic acting that could be seen in `Men in Black.' Actually, you mighty see no difference in two roles, one Roland Sharp Texas Ranger of this film and Agent K in `MIB.' I rememered Robert DeNiro who is virtually doing the same dead-serious comic turn since `Analyze This.'

The cheerleaders you see here are intentionally stereotyped ones, so don't expect that Monica Keena, Kelli Garner, Christina Millian, Paula Garces, and Vanessa Ferlito do real cheerleading. They are there as eye-candy, and though one of them seems to adore Tommy Lee's character, the director seems to have chosen to just drop the theme. After all, when Tommy Lee Jones meets them, and another elder female character, professor of literature played Ann Archer, the film has nothing to do except for showing funny bits of comedy (like those of TV sitcoms) about the clashing egos between the man and the girls, which are certainly enjoyable to see, and some obligatory set-pieces that keeps the story moving, which ends with a predictable conclusion.

The director is Stephen Herek, whose CV includes `The Might Ducks' Charlie Sheen's `The Three Musketeers' `Holy Man' and `Rock Star.' And don't forget `Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.' If you have seen any of these fairly entertaining, but otherwise undistinguished films, you know what you will see in `Man of the House.'

1528518,2,B00005JNT2,"Months before its release, ""Man of the House"" was the subject of an extensive promotional campaign, it seemed like every visit to the theater included another opportunity to view its sexploitative trailer. Then a few weeks before the premiere the promotion stopped and the movie was released without fan-fair to a pared down list of theaters. Apparently some insightful person at the distribution company finally viewed the entire feature and figured out that the producers had failed to identify a target audience.

Seemingly aimed at teenage boys and promoted as sexploitation, the film is actually far more chick-flick than titillation, comedy, or action adventure. And they wonder why these things lose money.

Tommy Lee plays Roland, a Texas Ranger (a reprise of his character in ""The Fugitive""), who (big surprise) is not big on smiling or on emotional displays of any kind. Right under his nose a Texas mobster named John Cortland has the government witness Roland is guarding murdered, and Roland's female partner shot. This seems to irritate Roland, who hates people named John, as everybody knows. Lucky for Roland, five UT cheerleaders saw the murder. Because they're witnesses, they are in danger, so to protect them Roland moves into their house near campus. It is the best student housing I have ever seen but it serves to put Tommy Lee into close contact with the young females.

Instead of the snotty cheerleader stereotype, each girl fits into her own movie stereotype- the Bad Girl (a cowgirl via Brooklyn), the Latina Firecracker (who speaks with the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel), the dumb blonde (who falls for Tommy Lee but loses out to her English Professor-insert ""Back to School"" here), the Brainiac blonde (who does little more than get her period and balance out the blonde quotient), and the token black girl (who would only be considered black in America and whose lines are limited to the philosophy of cheerleading). Kelli Garner as the dumb blonde is a pleasant surprise. Unlike Tommy Lee, none of the girls are demonstrably embarrassed to be in the film, despite being far less sexy that the actress who plays Tommy Lee's daughter.

Predictably it is only a matter of time before Roland's grumpy exterior is worn down by his house-mate's perky charms. Unfortunately for action/adventure fans (or for those looking for a bit of suspense in their films), there is never any sense that the girls are in actual peril. At least in part because close examination of the premise reveals little or no logic to support the necessity of having them eliminated.

While there isn't much to recommend ""Man of the House,"" there's no major reason to warn people off other than the horrible mismatch between content and target audience. It's no worse than half the movies that get made. But be prepared to fast-forward through the sequence where the girls give Tommy Lee a makeover. If you view this in real time it will haunt your dreams and retard your sleep for many years to come.

I can watch MIB and MIIB over and over.  And even if this movie is feather-light, Tommy Lee delivers his deadpan straight lines in such a way that you can't help but getting a kick out of it.  The editorial reviews really nailed it: yes, it's predictable, yes it's fluff--- but it's good and fun predictable fluff.

The acting by the cheerleaders is lame. There is room for plot development, but only a shallow attempt is made. What more could go wrong?

The story is very slow moving. The background plot of the murder seems irrelevant really. Most of us are watching it for the cute cheerleaders. But instead, we are given stupid girls with no personality. Heck, even sterotypes fail us! We want to laugh at the combination of an uptight ranger and adolescent girls, but Man of the House fails to deliver, yet again.

Basically, a no go with me. However, if you live under a rock and are completely oblivious to the world around you, you may find this funny and slightly enjoyable. For the rest of us, stick to the classics like Bring It On.",1132272000,2,901,4.660377358490566
1528584,4,B00005JNT2,"This movie is a strictly by-the-numbers action flick with all the depth of a mud puddle, but it is surprisingly enjoyable nevertheless.  The formulaic plot is as follows:  A group of Texas Longhorn cheerleaders witness the mob execution of a witness wanted by the Texas Rangers, and thus they need protection in order to avoid becoming victims themselves.  Enter Tommy Lee Jones, who is forced to move into the girls' house on campus and babysit them for protection.  Predictable hilarity ensues, with plenty of culture clashes between the college girls and the crusty Jones.

This movie is about as formulaic as you can get.  The plot holds no surprises whatsoever, the identity of the bad guy is obvious from the beginning, and the action scenes are workable but nothing spectacular.  Nevertheless Tommy Lee Jones manages to take an average movie and lift it up to the level of a great popcorn flick that will appeal to pretty much everyone.  Cedric the Entertainer also appears in the film as an ex-con minister who is also a former UT cheerleader, and his scenes are a lot of fun to watch.  Anne Archer appears in the film as a UT professor who becomes Tommy Lee's love interest, but her role is pretty minimal.

1528585,4,B00005JNT2,"I wasn't all that excited about seeing this movie - but it did feature Cedric the Entertainer as well as cheerleaders, so I went ahead and watched it.  I knew the film would be pretty stupid - and it was - but I have to admit I was rather pleasantly surprised by Man of the House (and not only because I happily discovered that Monica Keena was also in it).  Putting the dour-faced Tommy Lee Jones in the middle of five giddy cheerleaders is definitely good for some laughs, and the characters really started to grow on me after the first half hour of extremely stereotyped characterization finally faded away.  Texas Ranger Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones) stalks around like he's impervious to any danger, and the cheerleaders are seriously dumbed down when we first meet them - this superficial treatment doesn't do the movie any favors coming out of the gate.

Here's the basic story.  Five University of Texas cheerleaders witness the murder of a government witness being sought by Sharp to testify against some high-level criminal.  Thus, the girls are the only witnesses that stand in the way of Mr. Moneybags' freedom from prosecution - despite the fact that they can't even begin to come up with a description of the man they saw pull the trigger.  Sharp is given the job of protecting the girls, which makes him the girls' newest roommate back on campus.  The girls, being silly cheerleaders, don't think they are in danger and balk at everything the ultra-serious Ranger asks them to do.  He, of course, has a problem with their skimpy outfits (for reasons I certainly can't fathom), unmentionables in the bathroom, etc.  Eventually, though, they develop a sort of friendship, with the girls helping Sharp reconnect with his daughter and woo a lady professor and Sharp loosening up and having a little bit of fun.

There are some pretty funny scenes in the film, especially when Sharp is playing the part of the new assistant cheerleading coach (and getting some cheers of his own at one of the football games).  I was a little disappointed that Cedric the Entertainer had a much smaller role than I expected, but that man always makes the most of his minutes.  I do wish the film had been set at some other university than Texas because I don't like their coach (who, fortunately, didn't appear in the film - although Texas Governor Perry did have a quick cameo) and because their cheerleaders have some of the most unappealing cheerleading outfits I know of.

Granted, it won't win any awards, but it does a good job as a time suck with its standard fish out of water story and count them, five token hot chicks.

The story follows Tommy Lee Jones as a Texas Ranger, not the kind that would know Derek Jeter as some of the girls think, who is protecting a group of cheerleaders from the University of Texas who have witnessed a murder that is linked to a high powered businessman.  The ladies he is protecting include the token hot chick from Undeclared as the brainy one with social anxieties, Vanessa Ferlito, who is on one of the CSI's, Omaha maybe, plays the tough as nails one but has all the deep thoughts not too mention the only one who could master the Texas accent, Paula Garces, who surprisingly is on the wrong side of thirty playing a college student, and Chistina Milian, best know for her singing career, well actually not really, both play the fiery Latina chick, not sure why they didn't just combine the characters.  The standout of the cheerleaders though was Kelli Garner as the boy, and man, crazy dumb blonde, who brought depth and heart to what could have been just your routine Jessica or Paris caricature.  Rounding out the cast was Cedric the Entertainer who's talents were somewhat wasted as the ex-con turned preacher.

Most of the movie is pretty predictable with the girls helping Jones character get in touch with his feminine side including the prerequisite makeover montage.

The 5 girls were positive, not a bit dumb and supported one another all along. How they inspired Tommy Lee Jones to transform from a man who could not express his feelings publicly as a Dad, a lover and a coach into a lovable guy was actually the main theme. Tommy Lee Jones was a natural in the movie. He played his role effortlessly and was so convincing as a straight and competent cop. The 5 girls had great dance sequences and personalities. I liked Christina Milian best among the girls. Her dance was dynamic and energetic. Anne Archer was the credible love interest and I wished her part could be bigger.

1528590,3,B00005JNT2,"Man of the House is a comedy/action film starring Tommy Lee Jones in the main role as a Texas Ranger who is trying to solve a murder case. To assist him in solving the case, Jones rounds up a group of five Texas Longhorn Cheerleaders- the only people who are known to have witnessed the murder. To protect these witnesses from the general public, Jones moves in with them and lives at their campus residence.

Most of the comedy part of this film is supplied by the interaction between Jones and the cheerleaders. He has nothing in common with these young women and he is annoyed by many things they do. But he also knows they are witnesses to a crime he is determined to solve, so he tolerates their differences.

The action part of this movie comes when Jones is searching for the person who committed this crime. There is some blood and gore in this film, but it is kept under control enough to avoid receiving an ""R"" rating. These parts of the film provide some good contrast to the humor, but it also adds to the movie's instability, if you will. You never know what direction the film is going to take or whether or not it's a comedy or a drama.

I like Tommy Lee Jones, but I think his performance in this movie is rather tired and uninspired. Anne Archer is good, but her role is minimal. The women who play the cheerleaders are ok, but nothing special and their roles could have easily been played by other actresses with equal effectiveness. Speaking of the cheerleaders, they are very stereotypical and this could bother some viewers. There is a cheerleader to represent different races and they are generally not very bright- typical of what you find in this type of movie. They don't play much of a role in the movie either, except (apparently) to give men something to look at.

There are some flaws in this movie, but I still liked it well enough to recommend it. The film has some fun moments and Tommy Lee Jones, while not at his best, is good enough to make the movie memorable.",1126569600,4,1996,4.445355191256831

The girls are all pretty and they each contribute to the forward motion of the story one way or another, as do the other characters.  I think the director did an excellent job of putting all the elements together and keeping it moving.  Tommy Lee adds depth to the father figure/mentor character and brings some deadpan humor as well.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This is a formulaic story that departs from the formula in subtle ways.  It's surprisingly mature and serious in parts.  It's a comedy, but not a laugh-a-minute type.  The humor is the kind I like; it's derived from the characters and their interactions, like the interaction between Tommy Lee's character and Robert Duvall's character in ""Lonesome Dove"".

Nobody does the stone-faced, smartass Southern authority figure quite like Tommy Lee Jones.

He has an air-conditioner the size of a semi installed and sets the thermostat to a level appropriate for a meat locker, and sends the $7,000 bill to his police captain.  Boy, that's a funny one!

Cedric the Entertainer has a small role as an ex-con who is now a minister who maintains his criminal contacts.  As our hilarious script would have it, ol' Preacher Ced was ALSO a Texas Longhorns Cheer-Guy and we get to have a ""by the numbers"" dance number where Cedric shows the girls how to do things ""old school"".

The movie has one cliched scene after another, and there were about four or five times I worked up a pretty good chuckle.  This is not the highlight of Tommy Lee Jones' stellar career.",1122249600,9,1944,4.618075801749272
1528657,3,B00005JNT2,"""Man of the House"" is yet another film where the trailer is better than the movie.  The trailer for this 2005 comedy gives you the best line of the movie (""This IS my hap-pay face"") and the funniest moment (Tommy Lee Jones tackles the Razorback mascot), both of which come relatively early in the film.  The trailer also gives you the idea that Cedric the Entertainer is going to be a bigger part of the story than he actually ends up providing and when you do your post mortem on ""Man of the House"" you can decide if the biggest sin of the screenplay by Robert Ramsey & Matthew (no, I am not Matt) Stone and John J. McLaughlin is that it could not make better use of Cedric's presence or the more fundamental failure to punch up the predictable storyline to take advantage of the inherently humorous juxtaposition of Tommy Lee Jones and a bunch of University of Texas Cheerleaders.

Jones is Roland Sharp, a dedicated and humorless Texas Ranger who has sacrificed his marriage and alienated his daughter because his job is his life.  The only thing surprising about Sharp is that his partner on the Rangers is a woman (and one of the best moments in the film is when Sharp talks about what it was like for a dinosaur like him to end up with a female partner).  But then a government witness is shot right in from of Sharp and his partner is wounded.  Sharp then ends up with the job of babysitting five Texas cheerleaders who saw a murder related to the case (the witness was going to testify against somebody who does not want to be testified against).  The cheerleaders are in danger, whether they believe it or not, and Sharp is going to keep them alive.  Although he has a pair of younger Rangers with him, they are sent across the street from the house in which the cheerleaders live and Sharp does his job mainly hearing all, seeing all, and being ahead of the game well enough to successfully put his foot down.  What chance do five young cheerleaders have against Tommy Lee Jones?  Not much, I can tell you that (his way of persuading the girls to wear clothing that exposes less of their bodies is pragmatic, but expensive).

The five cheerleaders are played by Vanessa Ferlito, Paula Garcs, Kelli Garner, Monic Keena, and Christian Millan.  The names of the cheerleaders are Anne, Barb, Evie, Heather, and Teresa.  The order of the names of the actresses and the characters are provided in alphabetical order, which means they do not match up, but then these are not really fully developed characters (just fully developed cheerleaders) so getting them confused does not matter much.  You can distinguish them on the basis of hair or skin color more than you can their shallow personalities (e.g., one has phone sex with her boyfriend while another thinks Sharp is cute).  When the girls find out that Sharp is estranged from his teenage daughter, this matters more to them than the fact someone is trying to kill them and Sharp is curtailing their liberties.  Of course, they are going to do something about that, and, of course, that is going to put them in a position to be killed.

Although people do get killed in this movie, the threat is not really serious, so when the cheerleaders put themselves in harms way it is supposed to be comic.  Sharp is given a love interest in the form of Anne Archer as Professor Molly McCarthy, which sets up a cute scene where the girls talk Sharp through a date using his ear piece that unfortunately reduces Archer to a piece of furniture.  Cedric the Entertainer is Percy Stevens, an ex-con turned preacher, who shows up periodically to provide uninspired comic relief.  The fact that he ends up not being integral to the story distracted me a bit because I was not certain why he was in the film at all if they were not going to give him anything substantive to do.

Apparently ""Man of the House"" was originally entitled ""Cheer Up,"" and there is a story that they did not come up with the ending until a month after the rest of the movie was shot, all of which speaks to how appealing it is to throw Tommy Lee Jones in with a bunch of cheerleaders and let him thaw out just a bit so that he can show more emotional depth than irritation.  Actually, you can argue that the best rapport between characters in the movie are those scenes pairing Jones with R. Lee Ermey as Captain Nichols, which certainly makes for a nice pair of old school stone faces where a blank stare is as good as a raised eyebrow.  But while it was never the goal to make anything more than a piece of fluff, they still should have been able to come up with a script that would have made this more of an entertaining piece of fluff.",1122076800,,4658,4.479905437352246

1528714,5,B00005JNT2,"Tommy Lee Jones stars as a curmudgeonly Texas Ranger tasked to protect a squad of University of Texas cheerleaders who have witnessed a murder.  In order, to do this, Jones must move in with them and become 'the man of the house.' He poses as the girls' cheerleading coach.

Jones not only has to cope with protecting the girls against an unknown assailant, he has to cope with everyday problems:  homework not getting done, a crush on the part of one of the cheerleading squad, the squad's determination to work as a team--and do their job for their school and the athletes.

In the process of their association, Jones gets in touch with his softer side and the girls use their teamwork skills to help their guardian out of a jam.  ""Man of the House"" is both uproariously funny and touching at the same time.  While it's definitely one of Tommy Lee Jones' more low-budget films, I also think Jones has quite a skill at comedy.  Also, look for some of the actresses who played in this film to be in starring roles in future ventures.",1119830400,11,1033,4.521505376344086
1528715,1,B00005JNT2,"If you're sitting in a theater, watching a ""comedy"" and you don't laugh, is it still a comedy?

There are certain films you should be aware of. Films released during most of January and in late August/ early September. These are the slowest periods of the year and the studios tend to dump films that they don't think are any good. And all films produced by Revolution Studios. This company has only produced one film that might be considered `good' and that was Ridley Scott's ""Blackhawk Down"".

Notice how I am artfully delaying my critique of ""Man of the House""?

The trailer preceeding ""Man of the House""  was for ""XXX: State of the Union"", also produced by Revolution Studios. Don't even get me started on the fact that they made a sequel to ""XXX"". In the trailer, Samuel Jackson is featured prominently, but at the end of the trailer, his name isn't even listed. I suspect that he was overwhelmed by the money offered and underwhelmed by the final product and had his name removed.

Apparently, Tommy Lee Jones couldn't have his name removed from ""man of the House"", the abysmal new `comedy' in which he appears in virtually every scene.

It's a familiar premise. Stoic, uptight guy (Jones), in this case a Texas Ranger, is deposited in an environment that makes him uncomfortable. Jones has to protect a group of five cheerleaders at the University of Texas, Austin, who have witnessed a murder. The cheerleaders are all vain, dumb and try to lighten up Jones' character. You'll laugh your head off. Unfortunately, in ""House"", there is almost nothing, scratch that, there is nothing, to make you even remotely smile.

This set-up has been used hundreds of times and is already a pretty tired concept, but the film is so dead upon arrival that almost no one even seems to have the energy to try to make it work. Jones walks through the role, virtually the same role he does in action films and thrillers, with the usual competence. This is also supposed to be the joke. Because we are so familiar with Jones from ""The Fugitive"" and other films as the no-nonsense, won't stop for anything lawman, we are supposed to laugh when we watch him dealing with five scantily clad college cheerleaders.

The problem with this film lies in two areas: the tired premise, as already addressed, and the complete stereotypical nature of the cheerleader characters. They're obsessed with their bodies? They're promiscuous? They love to shop? They want to go out and party? Wow, that's original.

Clearly, the filmmakers intended for some of the most tired elements of the film to ""liven things up"". Jones' character has a bad relationship with his daughter, who is approximately the same age as the hookers, er,  cheerleaders with a heart of gold that Jones' is charged to protect. What do you think will happen? Yep, that's right.

Stephen Herek, the director, has created yet another truly terrible film. His previous efforts have included ""Holy Man"", starring Eddie Murphy, ""Rock Star"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Aniston and ""Life or Something Like It"" starring Anjelina Jolie and Edward Burns. Let me amend my previous statement.

There are certain films you should be aware of. Films released during most of January and in late August/ early September. All films produced by Revolution Studios. And all films directed by Stephen Herek.",1110931200,3,3339,4.859154929577465

I am not a professional reviewer so I can't dissect this movie to explain why it works.  Could it be that Tommy Lee Jones and Ann Archer are good at their chosen careers?  While certainly cute and funny, the cheerleaders were just serious enough not to make a mockery of the movie's concept.

True, the story line seems to blend the babes in the pom-pom girl team and the gymnists of the cheerleader squad into one group, but that's Hollywood.

And, just for the record:  the school in question is NEITHER Texas A&M nor Texas State (both fine schools) but the University of Texas...Longhorns...that's why there are longhorns painted on the girls' cheeks and just about everywhere the camera points in Austin, Texas, where the campus of the University of Texas is located.  That's why so many people in the movie are seen holding their hands in an otherwise very curious display of fingers.  And, that's why the colors burnt orange and white are awash on screen.

For those outside of Texas or those who don't like college sports, this movie would probably rate 3-stars, but I gave it 4 stars to account for a 1-star bonus directed to all those viewers who do like college athletics or have any interest in Texas or Big 12 programs.",1109462400,16,1501,4.633962264150943
1528720,5,B00005JNT2,"Tommy Lee Jones executive produced this surprisingly charming movie.  When I saw the trailer, I thought this would be a fluff police partner movie that takes place in a sorority house.  I was wrong.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a Texas Ranger whose partner, a young woman Texas Ranger, is shot during a mission to bring back a witness to testify against a powerful criminal.  When the witness escapes and gets killed in an alley, Tommy Lee must protect the only witnesses to this crime - 5 cheerleaders from A&M University.  They are everything he isn't - young, girlish, fun-loving, and peppy.  That's where the humor lies.  But because of Tommy Lee Jones' daddy-like wisdom and perspective, this movie does not turn into another teen comedy.  It becomes more of an eye-opening look at generational differences, cheerleader stereotypes, police stereotypes, and honor.  Not much publicity surrounds this movie so it will fall under the radar.  Nonetheless, if you want to see a movie of substance, but still get some elements of contemporary Hollywood movie themes - great-looking actors, action, humor, and a love story, then see this movie.
