7972277,2,B00006LPGK,"Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE anything with Ekin Cheng in it (see my other reviews) however this video was just plain tedious!
This is the story of Nam (Ekin Cheng)and his best friend Chicken (Jordan Chan), Nam and Chicken are members of a gang, when Nam gets promotion to chief ""Boss,"" his life becomes even MORE complicated. The plot mostly revolves mostly around some nonsense about a wedding and a rival gang Taiwanese San Luen gang, however most of this is quite difficult to follow - and there is a reason for this. This video is part of the Young and Dangerous series, and viewers are expected to be familiar with the material and the characters from previous episodes.
If you are interested in following or even understanding the events in ""Born to be King,"" I would recommend viewing the rest of the Young and Dangerous series first. The Triad series is one of the most popular and longest running gangster series in HK.",1050624000,4,941,4.607142857142857
