5198473,5,B008ZRKIHU,"I enjoyed this movie and felt it was very professionally done for a low budget church produced film. The story shows how even ""Christian"" people become trapped by worldly desires and lose sight of their goals. But with faith and ""surrendering"" to God, peace can result. A good family film for all.",1387324800,2,297,4.730769230769231
5198474,5,B008ZRKIHU,"This movie is wonderful.. So many lessons learnt,  at the end my hubby and I was able to have a real conversation about what we needed.

The acting was great the message was clear.

I am looking forward to a sequel. ..",1387238400,2,218,4.142857142857143
5198475,5,B008ZRKIHU,"This movie brought to light that as Christians we go through struggles and hurdles that we still need to overcome. For a low-budget church movie, it was a high quality film. Love it!",1387238400,2,182,4.545454545454546
5198476,5,B008ZRKIHU,"This movie has great acting, cinematography and directing.  I love the plot and was drawn in by the characters.  I encourage you to pick this up for your friends and family.  They will be blessed!  LOVE IT!!",1387238400,,207,4.513513513513513
5198477,5,B008ZRKIHU,"This movie is heart-felt, relatable, and simply powerful! Portrays truth and hope in spite of life's difficulties. A must see for the whole family.",1387238400,2,147,5.166666666666667
5198478,5,B008ZRKIHU,"Seen this movie many many times! This is a great movie with a message that really has something in it for the whole family! Parents will laugh and so will the kids.  The main character ""Jay"" learns how to give his heart completely to God. Hence why the movie is called ""Surrendered.""
Grab one you'll love it!",1387238400,3,308,4.4035087719298245
5198479,2,B008ZRKIHU,"I'm a big fan of Christian films, and especially appreciate the current efforts to bring the message to people's doorstep and living rooms in a fresh new way. This movie missed the mark terribly for me, and my husband refused to watch it to the end.  The promised story line had so many interesting places to go, but alas, just didn't get off the ground for me.
I found its message confusing.  It didn't make sense for the ""Christian"" spouse to be having an affair and condemning the ""unChristian"" spouse who had an anger problem ..... unless one is truly not better than the other.  There seemed to be no moral high ground.
I would have liked to see more of the positive outcome at the end, for both of them and wondered if some of the scenes were simply deleted due to time constrictions.
Finally, from what I saw, it simply wasn't acted in a believable way, but that could be improved in future efforts. I applaud the thoughts behind the making of this movie, and encourage the writers/actors to try again.",1386892800,7,1009,4.502732240437158
5198480,5,B008ZRKIHU,"Great heart warming movie for the whole family! It will have you crying at one moment, and laughing the next, all while maintaining a solid Christian foundation and bringing the viewers back to the idea of what Christmas is really all about.",1386806400,2,241,4.761904761904762
5198501,5,B008ZRKIHU,It was a really good movie. I enjoyed it and look forward to sharing it with my family.,1455235200,,87,3.888888888888889
5198502,2,B008ZRKIHU,"I risked it. Took a chance on this after reading the conflicting reviews. The story is so disconnected. Never seems to actually start or go there. And cliche after cliche. And like others have said, the acting is distracting.",1443571200,,225,4.794871794871795
5198503,4,B008ZRKIHU,It depicts many family where money has priority over relationship.,1442448000,,66,5.7

5198505,5,B008ZRKIHU,The movie was inspirational to me because It spoke to priorities in your life. Wonderful movie- recommend it to anyone with priorities out of order.,1424390400,,148,4.96
5198506,5,B008ZRKIHU,very pleased,1421625600,,12,5.5
5198507,1,B008ZRKIHU,Movie sounded good but it was lousy.  The 1st two hours of the movie was mostly bickering and behavior showed for most of the actors was bad and inappropriate Christian behavioralmost nothing was done showing that behavior to be wrong.  They could have showed some self examination and correction of behavior as part of the movie (& mending of relationships).It had potential but it should have been approached differently.,1419811200,2,423,5.115942028985507
5198508,5,B008ZRKIHU,Excellent movie! Very well done!,1419552000,,32,5.6
5198509,1,B008ZRKIHU,Most of the reviews are from family members or close friends. Wait until you can watch this movie as a prime option for free.,1411603200,2,125,4.25
5198510,5,B008ZRKIHU,Okay,1410652800,,4,4.0
5198550,1,B008ZRKIHU,"Horrible horrible movie. It seems like other people leaving reviews on Amazon gotta be family members of the cast, look for reviews somewhere else.  Nowadays there are so many great Christian productions that are worth enjoying with family and friends and to come across something like this is embarrassing!!!!  Terrible acting, terrible lines and the saddest thing is that the apparent ""christian"" characters did not behave Christ like at all. What a waste of time!",1410566400,3,466,5.2
5198551,4,B008ZRKIHU,"I really am not into preachy faith based movies. But this one I was able to get all the way through because I did not even realize it was suppose to be that type of movie until toward the end.

 I liked the way movie did not surrender to stereotypes. That was very refreshing...that was my family,  I  I liked that they showed that one black family comes in all shades from the very light to the brown skin and all body shapes. And they basically all got along, no Medea types.  You never see that in movies.

 But what really kept me watching was the lead actor, the father. I never seen him before but he was very good. At last a movie where the fat guy just plays it straight. You would think that fat guys are always some type of clown if you just looked at movies I also like that they did not always allude to his weight. He was just part of the family. I would love to see this actor in another role he was that good to me.
The movie was entertaining without being preachy and that is all I expect out of a good movie.  One last thing I want to know why this movie is not even listed on IMBD.com.",1403136000,,1103,4.004566210045662
5198552,2,B008ZRKIHU,"I am sorry, but this movie wasn't very good.  Pretty boring and my husband thought so too.  We both love Christian clean movies, but wish the acting was better.",1390694400,5,160,4.482758620689655
5198553,5,B008ZRKIHU,"Excellent movie for the whole family, it will make you reconsider how your own life may be along with those changes that need to be made!!",1388534400,,138,4.346153846153846
5198554,5,B008ZRKIHU,"GREAT STORY of how God can change people who are hardened, unopen to change, and think all is lost.  Praise the Lord for sending Jesus :)!  Loved the movie, storyline, and music.",1387756800,,178,4.53125
5198555,5,B008ZRKIHU,"Great movie. It was funny, engaging and suspenseful. The story is very believable and although everyone may not relate to the issues presented, it shows that hope is not lost and forgiveness can be found. Highly recommended.",1387411200,2,224,5.081081081081081

5198558,5,B008ZRKIHU,"This is an uplifting story that both challenges and captivates the audience. It's easy to see yourself in the characters and find yourself learning the lessons along with them. Though there's a Christmas undertone in the film, it's a great choice to watch any time of year!",1387324800,2,273,4.829787234042553

8533097,4,B008ZRKIHU,"Surrendered DVD is a pretty good movie, especially near the end. It concerned a man who acted like a total jerk, always yelling at his wife and children, but inwardly it was because he was hurting. When he finally finds God, he finds his true self-worth.",1457049600,,254,4.543478260869565
