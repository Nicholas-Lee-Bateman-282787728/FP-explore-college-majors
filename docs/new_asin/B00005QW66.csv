This is a lazy day where sinus meds decide what to do for you and that was watch Bail Out. This is an early film David Hasselhoff produce it was a bit campy but enjoyable (except for the nude girls that had nothing to do with the film).David Hasselhoff's character made me crack up I thought I didn't hear it right his name in the movie is ""White Bread"". The two other characters with Hasselhoff make the movie laughable just count how many times the ""F"" word is used must of ran out of script then. I really thought this movie was funny the only regret is Hasselhoff needed to make another movie with the two characters that were invovled with the whole moive. You'll know what I mean when one of them carries around a tool box which turns out to be nothing but guns. It is action/comedy movie with another damsel in distress rescue which David Hasselhoff pulls off well, but as I said without the other two this would of been a yawner. Good movie to watch when you're too lazy to do anything else especially on a boring day and nothing is on TV... Linda Blair's only funny part was at the end of the movie,it's well worth watching Hasselhoff try and ride a horse...tilt sideways and begin to laugh. Although the action is mostly at the end this movie it should of been brought forth sooner and maybe a bit longer to recieve more stars. It's an okay film but not David Hasselhoff's best.",1046649600,,1518,4.3674911660777385
