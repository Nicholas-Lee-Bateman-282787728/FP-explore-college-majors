3094411,5,B0012QE4PI,"Die F&auml;lscher (The Counterfeiters) deserves its Oscar as the Best Foreign Film of 2007. Based on a true story and singed with horrifying details of the Nazi treatment of 'detainees' (primarily Jews) during WW II, the inner story of this film is one of resilience and survival against near impossible odds and how one man turned his criminal gifts into a system so impressive that he served as a 'provider' of funds to the financially depleted Third Reich war effort.  The story is in itself fascinating enough to hold our interest for the duration of the film, but it is the incredibly ingenious and wily character of Salomon 'Sally' Sorowitsch that burns a space in our minds of how one man survived the concentration camps and in his own way helped fellow Jews to likewise survive the Holocaust.

Salomon 'Sally' Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics) is a brilliant counterfeiter, a Russian Jew so gifted in his ability to forge documents such as passports that he is able to live the 'good life' - money, women, gambling, etc. - until he is arrested by the Nazis and placed in a detention camp Sachsenhausen north of Berlin.  His facile mind sees his possible extermination and leads him to make a deal with the Nazis to spare his life (and the lives of his elected doomed accomplices) in return for making counterfeit money (British pounds)  so desperately needed to fill the coffers of the dwindling Nazi resources.  He and his confreres are afforded comfortable living space, good foods, and other amenities in a special sector of the concentration camp, a place where they can spend their time turning out volumes of money for the Nazis. In this way many of these 'selected' men manage to stay alive until the war is over, but the 'hero' character of Sally Sorowitsch remains an enigma of sorts: his cunning ideas are basically self centered and his focus remains on his own survival and ultimate gratification of yet another successful counterfeit business.  In other words, his story leaves a feeling of uneasiness with the viewer - is this a survivor to admire or is this a 'player' whose sense of compassion is marred by his own selfish goals?  The viewer is left to decide.

Though Karl Markovics is very strong in the leading role, the supporting cast of some of Germany's finest actors brings a depth of humanity and perception to the major issue the film addresses - both death and survival in the onerous concentration camps of the Nazis. Director/screenwriter Stefan Ruzowitzky deserves kudos for the manner in which he shows both sides of the seminal situation.  His cinematographer Benedict Neuenfels manages to capture the lurid light of the confined men and makes the intolerable almost tolerable to watch: the haunting musical score by Marius Ruhland completes the atmosphere.  This is a powerful movie on every level, but it is a very disturbing film in many ways.  It will make the viewer think - and that is most definitely a strong point of this film.  In German with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, August 08",1218067200,45,3029,4.846899224806202
3094412,5,B0012QE4PI,"An incredible film that received an outstanding transfer to Blu - complete with the first disclaimer (I have seen) about the quality on the Blu case. In fine print under the 1080p/True HD specs: ""This film employs a variety of film stocks and grain structures in order to tell the story. This intentional visual style has been retained for this high definition presentation, as per the filmmaker's intent."" An obvious undertaking was fulfilled in making this film as I counted 18 film and movie studios/distributors shown on the case. The content has been reviewed quite thoroughly here so I went with checking the Blu angles.

Technical: The transfer was as flawless as I have seen with Blu, and each scene that ""retained the grain"" looked even better. The majority of what makes this Blu release a good owner is the special features and menu content navigation. My PS3 was made to upgrade to the 2.30 for this BD, but after that 8 minutes of installing and rebooting, navigation was seamless. The menu icons all moved when each selection is made and arrival to those items is very fast, on the S301 though it glitched itself to death with all of these same selections. While watching any of the low def special features in other BDs, I typically cannot access any menu items with the pop-up button, but in this case two opts always arrived (menu and close).

Content: The special features contain a goldmine of historical information and interviews for those with history interests. Between the Adolf Burger's Historical Artifacts piece, and the Interviews with real-life counterfeiter Adolf Burger (with Director) and the actors, all make for a  thorough re-telling of this story. The Making-of docu was well made, and the commentary was informative. The deleted scenes were roughly 6 minutes, and contained at least one powerful moment that I wish would have been in the film.

Overall, an excellent film with a respectful Blu transfer.",1217635200,4,1940,4.941717791411043
3094413,5,B0012QE4PI,"This 2007 Austrian film won an Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film of the year.  I can well understand why.  Startling, somber and disturbingly haunting, it is based on the true story of a Jewish criminal counterfeiter who was imprisoned by the Nazis. The film is brilliantly directed by Stefan Ruzowitz, who manages to humanize both the prisoners and the Nazis.

Karl Markovics is cast as Salomon Sorowich.  We first meet him after the war, visiting an upscale Monte Carlo casino with a briefcase full of American money.  There is then a flashback to 1936, when we see him as a successful counterfeiter who, for a fee, specializes in providing foreign passports for those who are trying to get out of Germany. He is arrested and sent to a concentration camp.  He manages to survive in awful conditions by drawing flattering portraits of the concentration camp guards.  He is so good at it that he is provided with the materials to do portraits of the guards and their families.

This privileged status in the camps comes to an end, however, when he is taken to another concentration camp where he and a select group of prisoners, which includes printers and graphic artists, are forced to produce counterfeit English pounds and American dollars for the Nazis.  Here, they are given privileges unknown to other inmates.  Their food is good, they sleep on beds with sheets and blankets, and their work conditions mirror those of a real print shop in the outside world.  Salomon Sorowich thrives in this atmosphere.  However, Aldoph Berger, played by August Diehl, another prisoner who believes in Communist ideals, accuses Sorowich of ""selling his soul"" and does everything in his power to sabotage the effort.  Somehow, the English pound is produced, but the counterfeiting of the American dollar project lags behind.  The prisoners all want to stay alive and would like to kill the Communist because no matter how luxurious their treatment, they all know they can be shot at any time.  How this all plays out is stuff that high drama is made of.  It kept be on the edge of my seat the whole time.

I did some research on this film which was adapted from a memoir of the Communist who, after the war, suffered periods of depression and later committed suicide.  Salomon Sorowich, however, escaped to Argentina where he continued his counterfeiting lifestyle by forging works of art.

This is not a film for everyone.  It is sad and disturbing.  But I do highly recommend it because it is a fine film with great acting, a well-paced storyline, and an extremely thought provoking theme.",1215820800,15,2597,4.830316742081448
3094414,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is a deliberately-paced, affecting personal drama about how thorny ethical dilemmas are in real life, and won a deserved Best Foreign Language Film award at the Oscars in 2008. The main character is Salomon Sorowitsch, a Russian Jew who is arrested for counterfeiting in 1939 and sent to a concentration camp. His artistic skill is quickly picked up, however, and he is eventually used in a counterfeiting operation known as Operation Bernhard, a plan to de-stabilize the British economy by flooding it with counterfeit currency. Since Sorowitsch is such a master at counterfeiting, he is able to pull off a perfect re-production of Bank of England notes that pass the inspection of even the highest inspectors. So the SS now turn their counterfeiting operation to the Dollar. Another inmate involved in the counterfeiting operation, Adolf Burger, realizes that they are effectively financing the Nazi war effort, and believes that a massive printing of counterfeit dollars could make a serious difference in the war. Burger begins destroying the negatives, and wants Sorowitsch to sabatoge the whole operation. This puts Sorowitsch in a dilemma- if the Nazis find out about the sabatoge, then all the counterfeiting inmates, who enjoy a comparatively privileged and comfortable life, will be sent to the death camps. If they continue with the operation, they will help the Nazis.

Which is more important- ensuring your own survival, or fighting for a just cause at the possible cost of your life? ""The Counterfeiters"" shows that such a dilemma is very difficult to resolve in one's day-to-day struggles, especially when great duress and oppression is present. The moral complexity of the movie is stunning. Whether the counterfeiters delaying tactics were what led to the Nazis' downfall or not, they did a very brave thing, and this movie does a great service in bringing their story to the public.",1211846400,13,1922,5.2
3094415,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiter of the Jews"" as he is addressed, ""Sally Sorowitsch"". is arrested on charges of  illegal activity and thrown into the Matthausen Concentration Camp.  Ah, but what good is he there?  The Nazi's , in the waining hours of WW2 realize that ""Sally"" will benefit their cause best if he is moved to the ""cushy camp"", Sachsenhausen, and put to work for them doing what he does best, counterfeiting!.First, it is the English Pound and then it is the American dollar that is masterfully ""remade"".  The Nazi's MUST finance their losing efforts by employing the resourceful and ""shifty-shady"" Sorowitsch to their advantage.  But working with him in the camp is also Adolf Burger, a Communist Jew who is not the ""hardened and savvy 'Sally'-type"" who is the moral compass of the film.  ""If we do this"" suggests Burger, ""we prolong the War and are helping them.""  Sally shrugs and responds ""So?""  Burger suggests sabotage.  This sets up the dilemma presented in this film; do we aid or do we revolt?  Both still may mean certain death!

Director Stefan Ruzowitzky, whose previous big score was the bleak&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inheritors/dp/B000PC72FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inheritors</a>, takes Adolf Burger's memoir and creates a dramatic and socially conscious film about complicity and the moral conscience about, in this case, Jews, thrown in to the camps, and their reactions to their situation.  This is not so much a Holocaust epic as it is an intimate 90- minute micro look at one certain point of concentration camp history. What this film does well is to clearly present both sides of two Jewish men caught in an impossible situation who examine their options and have to make decisions.

So many other films have preceded ""The Counterfeiters"" that have presented this same moral dilemma of Concentration Camp inmates who must make similar decisions.  Though ""The Counterfeiters"" is good, other films I would suggest are far superior in developing this same theme:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Ashes/dp/B0001DMW9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Ashes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grey-Zone/dp/B000087EYX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grey Zone</a>, and most especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playing-for-Time/dp/6301025571/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playing for Time</a>.

3094417,4,B0012QE4PI,"Oscar-winning (Best Foreign Language Film) ""The Counterfeiters"" is inspired by true events during World War II. Some of the main characters of the Austrian/German film are based on real persons and one of them Adolf Burger, a Slovak typographer, wrote a memoir ""The Devil's Workshop"" which became the basis of the film. Burger's book is about ""Operation Bernhard,"" Nazi's secret plans of forging English and American currency. Against the background of one of the largest counterfeiting schemes in history, Director Stefan Ruzowitzky (best known for his medical suspense ""Anatomy"" starring Franka Potente) has successfully created a tense thriller with powerful moments.

The film centers on Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), forger of documents. After being arrested in pre-war Berlin, a Russian Jew Solomon Sorowitsch is sent to a concentration camp. We discover though Salomon is not a heroic figure, he is clever. He learns to survive the horrible conditions of life there by drawing portraits of Nazi officers.

But more drastic change awaits him when he is later put in charge of one secret mission conducted by Nazis code-named ""Operation Bernhard"" - Salomon and other inmates (mostly Jewish prisoners) are confined in an inner section at Sachsenhausen concentration camp and are ordered to forge British bank notes.

One thing is certain. They must succeed. They also know Nazi officers would not wait long. But to succeed means to prolong the war and some of the fellow counterfeiters are aware of that too. This is where Adolf Burger (brilliant August Diehl) steps in, insisting on sabotage even though the delay could mean their death.

""The Counterfeiters"" is not only a gripping thriller; it also poses some questions about what we would and should do in most extreme situation. I only add that in his interview Adolf Burger said (he visited Japan in November 2007) that the episodes about the inmates playing ping pong and singing songs before the Nazi officers are both true.

Perhaps this moral dilemma of Salomon represented by Salomon and Adolf could have been explored more. Some scenes of the film are obviously the results of fictionalizing process on the side of filmmakers who wanted more dramatic moments. The film is certainly flawed, but, supported by unanimously great acting (Karl Markovics as Salomon Sorowitsch is stunning), ""The Counterfeiters"" is a gripping and fascinating thriller and drama.",1205193600,32,2428,5.263565891472868
3094418,4,B0012QE4PI,"The New Germany and Austria by extension have been in the process, these past several years, of divesting themselves of National Guilt in regards to the atrocities of World War 2: ""Sophie Scholl,"" ""Downfall"" and also the superb ""Lives of Others"" (though set in post WWII East Berlin, it reeks of submission and totalitarianism) speak to the redemptive qualities of confession and penance.
And now we have ""The Counterfeiters,"" the story of Solomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), a Russian-born Jew who spends his life forging documents thereby attaining the reputation of a master counterfeiter. Ultimately he is arrested and sent to a Camp at which he is given the assignment of forging the British Pound note for The Third Reich. This is 1945 and the disastrous German War effort is in dire need of cash to carry on its war effort.
""Counterfeiters"" is all about survival and to what means we, as human beings will do to comply in order to live: anything pretty much sums it up and anything pretty much is the reality of our collective desire to live despite the cicumstances.
Director Stefan Ruzowitzky is walking a slippery slope here as the counterfeiting was done in the Nazi concentration camp at Sachsenhausen and the technicians involved were almost all Jews, ""The Counterfeiters"" raises some provocative moral dilemmas.
Also, the Sorowitsch of Markovics is no paragon of honor. Instead he is a squirrelly, only thinking for himself, con man. He's happy to do what the Nazi's ask of him in order to get the perks of his ""exalted position"" in Sachsenhausen: clean clothes, good food, soft bedding, and weekly hot showers. ""The Counterfeiters"" begins with a post war sequence of Sorowitsch spending thousands of counterfeit British Pounds in Monte Carlo: gambling, grooming himself, dining, dating...basically enjoying the fruits of his labors and those of his fellow counterfeiters.
Sorowitsch is one who feels that: ""Only by surviving can we defeat them.""
""The Counterfeiters"" is a difficult film to like but ultimately it speaks to something in all of us: the drive, the desperate need to survive despite the circumstances in which we might find ourselves. Sorowitsch is flawed, a nasty piece of work actually but he's intelligent, crafty and grudgingly and ultimately deserving of our respect.",1204416000,38,2301,5.122340425531915

This movie is about this guy who is famous for forging fake money, passport, and checks of all kind.
The is a Jew born in Russia and during the Nazi period, the Nazi heppens to arrest him and put him in a camp for jews.
But the place where he was in was far from other jews. It was luxurious and full of plenty of stuff.
Although some of the nazi's treat them bad, the top officer who happens to be the one who arrested him treated him decently.

There he forged different kinds of moneys, checks to back up nazi for war budget. The German's are having hard time to having war and they did need money.

The movie was extremely well made.
The acting of Tim Breyvogei and all the others are so well done and even after the show, I still remembered their faces clearly. They were so lovable.
The young guy who end of being sick and died by nazi who shot him to kill, the guy who's wife is in Auschwitz, I think it was, wanted to conqure them and rull over the camp, and others.

And I shoul never forget about the beautiful exotic music by Hugo Daz along with harmonica tunes it was just so great to hear.
Try this.

If you think this is just another movie like <Schendler's List>, you are totally wrong. This movie is far from it and in some way it is way better. The movie never pushed us to feel what they felt like Shendler's List did. You know Spielberg.

I had never heard of this story from World War II and am glad this film was made to tell it, as it's an interesting part of history.

Salomon isn't your typical nice guy in a bad situation, he's a very self preservation person who at the start of the film states something along the lines that he doesn't care for the problems others Jewish people are facing as it's up to each person to control what they get out of life, but he does seem to develop a bit of a conscious as his incarceration goes on.  This realistic lack of Hollywood hero type character means, combined with the fact you the viewer are unlikely to have heard of this story before viewing, means you don't really know what moral decisions he (and the other prisoners) will make.

Although the graphic and dreadful situation of the concentration camps isn't shown as heavy as other films, The Counterfeiters still has enough scenes every now and again reminding you of the horror or the situation for the prisoners.  A great film and a great little known story from World War II.",1434240000,,1575,4.479020979020979

Fearing counterfeit operations by the British, the Third Reich has decided to centralize control over the German economy and train the best among the best counterfeiters in their prison camps (or concentration camps) to fake British and American money to flood the British and American economies with fake currencies - which will cause these economies to crash. What makes the film so enormously likable and well done is the convinging methodology used by the actors and producers to produce as much convincing atmosphere of the final days of WWII as possible. The nazis in charge of the camp operations where the counterfeiting is taking place also realize something else which some of their inmates have already been secretly suspecting - the British and Americans may be causing their own economies to collapse by sleepwalking - which to them could mean victory over the Allies even if the Allies themselves, in collaboration with the Russians officially win the war. As the film reaches it's climax the nazis lose control of the camp which results in it's liberation by the inmates. The film came to me as a part of a three part film collection - the Ultimate WWII Box Set and I am very satisfied. The other two were Days of Glory and an epic about two mountaineers.

3094636,5,B0012QE4PI,"******* NOTE: I try to avoid spoilers in the comments below *****

Before I saw this movie and read some historical background on it, I had never heard of Operation Bernhard, the Nazi plan to flood the Allied Countries with counterfeit pounds and dollars, and to establish a counterfeit production station in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen, manned by prisoners, some of them Jews, who had skills in printing and counterfeiting. Based on a book by one of the counterfeiters, Adolf Burger, the movie focuses on Salomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), a Jewish forger, who is arrested just before the World War 2 and imprisoned. He impresses his captors with his skill as an artist, so when Operation Bernhard is conceived, Sally is moved to Sachsenhausen and effectively put in charge of the counterfeiting operation.

The movie's interest is in Sally's moral consciousness. He's keeping himself alive -- and in relatively comfortable conditions -- but he's also helping keep his fellow prisoners alive. The counterfeiters all know that there is a whole other population in the camp who are treated with great cruelty and arbitrariness. But the counterfeiters also know that they are ""helping"" the Nazis, whose politics they despise, and to the extent that Operation Bernhard works, they could well be prolonging the war. So there's the makings of a moral dilemma here -- for if one sabotages or in any way slows down the counterfeiting production, one can claim to be fighting the good fight, but one might also be endangering the lives of the other counterfeiters if the Nazis become aware of the deliberate slowing-down.  If one wants to be a martyr, that's one thing -- but who gets to decide that all your fellow-counterfeiters ought to be martyrs too? These moral and existential dilemmas are registered through Sally's relations with his fellow-prisoner Adolf Burger (August Diehl) and with the Camp Commandant, Herzog (Devid Striesow). The counterfeiters manage to produce all the Pounds Sterling the Nazis need, but the US dollar is a harder nut to crack -- and is one of the group sabotaging the effort and thus putting them all in jeopardy?

Markovics plays Sorowitsch as a man of few words and great alertness of mind, and while he is alive to the better chances of survival that his work makes possible, he has to decide how to relate on a human level with prisoners like Burger, who want to resist the Nazis at every turn and see themselves as principled, as well as with the Kommandant, Herzog. Interestingly Burger and Herzog are both much more verbal than Sorowitsch. They articulate their agendas -- and one wonders of Herzog, who has a lot to lose if Operation Bernhard doesn't succeed, whether one can believe him or not. He can seem humane and even sympathetic, but he's also running a camp in which ""normal"" prisoners are very cruelly treated and even killed. Sorowitsch is very guarded with these characters -- and, in fact, with everybody -- and one has to gauge his moral stance as much from what he does or doesn't do as from what he says. Markovics is superb in the role -- and he says so little that the viewer should check out the interview with him among the ""special features,"" where he is articulate and cogent (in English!) about the role, its appeal for him, and his approach to acting in general.

Diehl and Striesow are equally compelling as Burger and Herzog respectively, and indeed the whole cast is splendid. The other prisoner/counterfeiters are presented without resort to stereotype, and their meeting near the end with the ""normal"" prisoners, with whom they have never been allowed to fraternize, is a tense and touching moment. The pictorial qualities are striking too -- the film has a not-too-polished look -- a documentary look? -- that fits the story well. It's tempting to compare this movie to ""Schindler's List,"" and it's less sentimental and less back-and-white. The Kommandant is no obvious monster, although whether or not he is really conflicted about the treatment of the prisoners or merely pretending to be as a means of manipulation is an open question.

The ""framing"" device has Sorowitsch bringing a boatload of money (forged) to Monte Carlo, where on his first night his gambling prowess impresses a lovely young woman, who in bed notices the tattoo on his arm. Switch to the story of life in the camps. At the end, we're back in Monte Carlo, the day after that shown at the movie's beginning -- the ending is surprising, and right.",1406160000,,4507,4.892670157068062

3094707,5,B0012QE4PI,"Incredible dramatic story of Salomon 'Salli' Smolianoff, once known as Europe's 'King Of The Counterfeiters'. (I believe due to legal reasons with his estate, he's renamed Salomon Sorowitsch for the film)

Described by Adolf Burger, writer of novel the movie is based on, as a disreputable character whose shallow and selfish desire for pleasure far outweighed any other concerns in life. Even in the face of a rising fascist state which seemed hellbent on the eradication of his people, Salli continued to party. His planned escape thwarted by shortsighted self-indulgence, he was captured by a Nazi SS team and sent to the concentration camps in 1939.

Like other biopics, there's some question as to the legitimacy describing Sorowitsch/Smolianoff's life. The author Adolf Burger, and fellow Operation Bernhard counterfeiter, met one another in Sachsenhausen concentration camp nearly five years after Salli was captured and did not know the man prior to the camps. However, I'm willing to give credence to his account since Smolianoff did not dispute them; although it's equally possible that he did not know (living in faraway Brazil) or did not care.

Regardless, the events in the camp are unquestionably accurate and have been documented by both allied forces who liberated the camp and the small handful of survivors. Suffice to say - the history of Sachsenhausen is beyond all horrific imaginings; the deviant sadists in charge of the camps were unspeakable devils.

Cast into this nightmare, Sorowitsch displayed a cunning ability to manipulate the situation to the best of his limited advantage. So that, even in the various hellholes he was transferred to, he was able to work his way to a generally sheltered existence; away from the horrors that took place every day and night outside the safe zones for the specially skilled. First as a portrait artist, then creating propaganda images for various camps, finally transferred to Sachsenhausen - specifically to oversee and supervise the top secret counterfeiting project known as Operation Bernhard.

Brilliantly performed by Austrian actor Karl Markovics, who delivers a delicate contradiction between an overwhelmingly self-interested heel, cast against stunning acts of personal bravery and sacrifice for his fellow prisoners. As a viewer you never find a strong enough box to pigeon-hole Sorowitsch - sharing qualities of both creep and hero. Like water, he's a fluid dynamic, breeching the smallest of advantageous openings or letting himself flow around the worst of calamities. Sorowitsch is very human and that makes his portrayal so much more real and compelling.

A profoundly stellar performance in an unforgettable film.

Note: The British Pound Notes that the counterfeiters created were so good, that beginning in 1957 the UK actually had to completely abandon the design, stock, and method of production for their paper money. So perfect were the forgeries that it had threatened to destabilize the British economy more than a decade after the war had officially ended. And it wasn't until a stunning 1981, when the recall of war-era 50 notes was enacted, that Operation Bernhard finally came to an end.",1305244800,,3183,5.291089108910891
3094718,3,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is a German historical-fiction film about Operation Bernhard, a secret operation conducted by the Nazi's during the latter years of World War II in which a team of concentration camp inmates counterfeit large sums of British money in order to fuel the Nazi war effort. The film follows the main character Solomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch, a master counterfeiter, who is arrested by the Nazi's and eventually sent to the Sachsenhausen (""Saxon-house/place"") concentration camp take part in Operation Bernhard. As essentially the prisoner-leader of the Operation, Sally must juggle the strict demands of his Nazi wardens with the determination of a few of his fellow prisoners' attempts to sabotage the Nazi war machine, as well as with the duty he owes to his fellow innocent prisoners to keep the Operation running smoothly and hence keep his mates alive. The result is a story engulfed in a sticky moral dilemma that ends (just in time) with the end of the war and the liberation of the concentration camp.

In my opinion ""The Counterfeiters"" is in between being a good film and a bad film. I thought that there were unnecessary scenes of sexuality and violence; and hence I thought that the film would have been essentially the same without these few scenes. For example, when Sally watches his friend Kolya get shot by a Nazi guard, we (the viewer) see Sally looking through a small window, then the film switches cameras and we see Kolya get shot through the head. Instead of this unnecessary five-second scene of disgusting violence whereby we see the bullet take a piece of flesh out of Kolya's head, I think that the camera should have stayed focused on Sally-looking-through-the-window since the result would still be the same: Kolya is brutally murdered. Instead, the camera switches to let the viewer watch the gruesome scene. Because of this (and several other similar scenes) I thought that ""The Counterfeiters"" was trying too hard to shock the viewer with violence that the viewer knows is simply un-real. Overall, the effect of this violence-saturation was to turn the film into something like a comic book or a wanna-be Schindler's List.

But I digress. I thought that the acting was merely OK as well. The main character seems to have only one facial expression throughout the film, and many of the other characters seem two-dimensional. Also, the soundtrack was strange: a mix of Latin American rhythms seemed to give the film a fake-ish feel. Also, I was somewhat morally confused when the main saboteur (Adolf Burger, played by August Diehl) is hailed as a hero by the concentration camp Jews after they had liberated the camp (after the Germans high-tailed): Burger (whose memoir, I learned from Wikipedia, served as the genesis of the screenplay), through his sabotage activities threatened the lives of the entire counterfeiting team. Perhaps he is shown as a hero because his sabotage slowed down the counterfeiting process, and hence hastened the end of the Third Reich, but I have trouble accepting this (heroism) because Burger had no idea that Sally had the power to prevent the sabotage (i.e. besides snitching on Burger)... But I digress again...

Broadly speaking, I think that we must take films like ""The Counterfeiters"" with a grain of salt, for this film is essentially a success story, while the Holocaust is most definitely not: it was, without a doubt, part of the worst series of events in modern history. While it may be human nature to look for and to find success stories and ""heroes"" in the history of the Holocaust, I think that often such stories serve to reduce the complexity of history, and far to often this is exactly what the casual movie-goer gets, which is to say, excitement and gratification.",1304985600,2,3760,4.97456279809221

How some ingenious Jews got a chance to escape the certain death by forging foreign currency and thus boosting the Germany's economy can certainly be - and it is - a great fodder for good filmmaking. And the team under Stefan Ruzowitzky, without a doubt, more than rises to the occassion. The script is devoid of cheap tearjerking scenes and pathos found, let's say, in Steven Spielberg's approach. Still, there are enough sobering moments of hard-to-swallow cruelty, reminding the viewer of the bleakness so entrenched in the era. Overall though, the film carries a certain nonchalance - probably deliberately - as it goes the long way in describing how counterfeiters really see the world. The final impact can be that the movie comes and it goes, does not stay with you for long.

3094727,4,B0012QE4PI,"Salomon Sorowitsch (superbly played by Karl Markovics) was a thriving Jewish counterfeiter in 1930s Berlin when he was arrested and sent to a Nazi concentration camp.  While there, he was put in charge of an operation, set up by the SS, to duplicate foreign currency in an effort both to de-stabilize the Allies' economies and to continue funding the Nazi regime and its war effort.  This activity secured for him and his fellow workers numerous privileges - additional food, more humane living conditions, an increased guarantee of safety - that were denied to the other prisoners in the camp.

On the surface, ""The Counterfeiters"" provides us with a grim and disturbing look at life in a Nazi death camp.  But, like Lina Wertmuller's ""Seven Beauties,"" it goes much deeper than that, exploring the thorny ethical issue of just how far a human being should be willing to go to ensure his own survival.  As Sorowitsch himself states, in a situation such as the one in which he finds himself, ""You adapt or you perish,"" and he refuses to let the Nazis, or anyone else for that matter, make him feel guilty for doing what it takes to stay alive.  But soon there is dissension within the ranks, as Burger (August Diehl), a political idealist who believes there`s a greater cause beyond their own survival, insists the men sabotage the effort - even if that means he and all his fellow workers die as a result.  Yet, thanks to the inmates' delaying tactics, only a small number of dollars were ever produced.

The other reviews say it all but what, for me, made the film so good was the way it captured the day-to-day decisions facing these people and the incredible dichotomy they faced between self-preservation and what was ""right"". What would you do in the same situation?... You know that by printing the highest quality forged dollar notes (which your group of Jewish technicians carefully selected for ""privileged treatment"" in the camp have the skills to do) you're extending your own survival time but also the survival time for the regime that's put you in this situation but, if you don't do it, you're condemning yourself and your workmates to certain death. So, do you deliberately ensure that the plates for printing the bank notes are flawed and, as a result, accelerate the fall of the Nazi regime but in the process sign your & their death warrants... or, do you do what's required (which you know you can), and ensure that you and they have a better hope of short term and, possibly, long term survival? Do you buy precious time for you & them even though you know that by buying this time you're also perpetuating the horrors that surround you?

The brilliance of this film is in the way that explores this incredibly complex situation. Who are the heroes here? Are they those who are prepared to sacrifice their lives to prevent the Nazis achieving their goals or are they those who are prepared to risk their lives to preserve the lives of the people who surround them? Is the pursuit of self-survival acceptable in this context and in the case of the central character, a confirmed crook, morally admirable or simply an extension of his own disregard for any morals?

Deep stuff and, thankfully, a decision that none of us are likely to face. But, if we did... what would we do? ""The Counterfeiters"" asks the question and, as a result, is a supremely thought provoking film with no easy answers.",1266364800,,2128,4.779891304347826

He finds his own salvation and that of others (if not their own lives) by, first, trying to stay alive by cooperating with the enemy and, then -- growing more deeply conscious of his own humanity and that of others as well as the evil of his captors -- trying to take seemingly small actions that could not only save their lives but contribute to the larger issues of winning wars and defeating the enemies of mankind.",1258588800,3,859,4.45859872611465
3094741,5,B0012QE4PI,"The Counterfeiters is an Asutrian-German film directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky that fictionalizes Operation Bernhard, which was a secret plan by the Nazis to destabilize the United Kingdom by flooding its economy with forged currency. The film center on a Jewish counterfeiter, Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), who is coerced into assisting the Nazis in a concentration camp. Salomon must juggle his need to stay alive by appeasing the Nazis, and to stall in the manufacturing of the fake currency. His fellow inmates range from political agitators who are reluctant to help the Nazis and others who are content to help in order to avoid the concentration camps. This creates a variety of dynamics between Nazis and inmates and between the inmates themselves. There is also a sense of guilt among these counterfeiters since they are given luxuries that other inmates in the camp do not enjoy, such as soft beds, better meals, music and a ping pong table. This comes to a head once the camp is freed by the other inmates of the camp at the war's end.

This is a gritty and suspenseful film based on the memoir written by Adolf Burger, a Jewish Slovak typographer, who was imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp and worked on Operation Berhard. The film won the Best Foreign language Film Oscar in 2008.",1258416000,,1314,4.9457013574660635

And as every thriller has a killer, so this one does in the form of the Nazi prison-camp machine that has engulfed them.  The intriguing plot, like mixing a con-game movie with a prison drama and set with unnerving moral dilemmas, grabs you from the get-go and does not relent.  All of the actors put in better-than-fine performaces.  Subtitles do not distract, quite the contrary actually.  To have everyone speaking German in a German concentration camp - would you expect anything less?

The camera work is deft and the editing keeps and creates the quick pace in which the story unfolds.  At once very entertaining and with all the touches of class that you'd expect from story-telling cinema at its best, The Counterfeiters is well worth your time.  Karl Markovics should have gotten an Oscar, if he didn't.  But what do you know, I see now this film took the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 2007.

3094746,5,B0012QE4PI,"The 2007 Academy Award winner for best foreign language film, The Counterfeiters tells the true story of Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), who was Germany's most successful counterfeiter in the pre-war era. His life changed dramatically when arrested and placed in a Nazi concentration camp. With Germany about bankrupt, the policeman that arrested him -- who is now his captor -- encourages Sorowitsch and some hand-picked specialists to trade life in the concentration camp for better living if they return to their old ways -- and produce counterfeit bank notes and foreign currency to fund the economically dying Nazi war effort.

The story focuses on the way Sorowitsch capitulates while maintaining independence and opposing the Nazis. The film, based on the book ""The Devil's Workshop""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-DEVIL-S-WORKSHOP-A-Memoir-of-the-Nazi-Counterfeiting-Operation/dp/1848325231/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE DEVIL'S WORKSHOP: A Memoir of the Nazi Counterfeiting Operation</a>&nbsp;by Adolf Burger, a member of the group who is portrayed in the film as the sole member of Sorowitsch's counterfeiting party with scruples. While Sorowitsch et al try to fulfill the Nazis goal of producing $1 million American a week, Burger does what he can to sabotage the operation. The Nazis catch on but the war's end saves everyone. Sorowitsch shows he too is a man of scruples, eventually turning against his captors and slaying the man that arrested him in Berlin all those years earlier.

Strongly recommended film. The Counterfeiters did something I never thought it would from the off set. Highly recommended.

3094762,5,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is based on the true story of the largest counterfeiting effort in history.  During WWII, the German's attempted to counterfeit the British Pound and the US Dollar using Jewish concentration camp captives in a last ditch attempt to sustain their war effort.  This German film won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2007 and contains some amazing performances, especially by Karl Markovics as Solomon Sorowitsch.

As we enter the picture, Sorowitsch is living large making big sums of money as a master forger of fake documents, currency and passports in Berlin in 1936.  Ultimately, Sorowitsch doesn't escape the grip of the Nazi's and winds up in a concentration camp.  When the Nazis decide to launch Operation Bernhard, they round up Sorowitsch and other Jewish printers, ship them to another concentration camp and accelerate their counterfeiting efforts.

""The Counterfeiters"" doesn't focus on the conditions of the Holocaust to the degree other great Holocaust/WWII pictures do like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful"".  The movie does paint a sufficient and horrifying enough picture of the treatment and conditions Jewish prisoners lived through.  But the brilliance of this picture is the moral conflict that Solomon and the other prisoners face.  Their efforts enable them to prolong their lives (and suffering), one day at a time, but also raise the specter that should the effort the Nazi's enlist their help succeed, they will face the same consequences as their other family members, friends and relatives.  While we empathsize with Sorowitsch and his plight, the picture creates a more ambivalent and conflicted sense of him than I expected.  While Solomon uses his situation to bargain for other prisoners, notably one with TB, we also see a duplicitous and self-centered side.

It is when another camp prisoner, Adolf Burger, attempts to sabotage the efforts to counterfeit the dollar, that the brilliance of this film really takes shape.  What is the right choice for these traumatized and tormented individuals?  Survive even if it means helping their captors and tormentors?  Resist and undermine the counterfeiting operation while surely facing certain death sooner?  The conflict is not only with the enemy, but is also within the ranks of these prisoners, simmering below the surface until it finally reaches its boiling point.

""The Counterfeiters"" is a tremendous piece of film-making.  It is emotionally wrenching and morally thought provoking -- a great piece of art that will linger with you for a long time after watching it.",1232236800,5,2581,5.2689486552567235

What I do wish to say is that coming up with the idea to make a movie on the Nazis and the counterfeiting exercise is brilliant and original. I think most other aspects of World War II have been repeated over and over again in too many different ways (The excellent HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" did come to mind).

The other point I wish to make (and which the movie illustrates so well), is that it is very important to be really good at something and to build a reputation on that ability. This fact is true in everyday life and also in the case of Salomon (Sally) from the movie.

I liked the way Sally's compassion for fellow prisoners and also the strong feeling of self preservation is depicted throughout the movie.",1229990400,,878,4.447204968944099
3094764,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" tells the story of concentration camp prisoners working for the Nazis during World War II.  The prisoners, all Jewish, make up phony passports and identification papers for spies and other criminals and then graduate into producing counterfeit currencies.  They start with the British pound paper and then go on to the U. S. dollar.  They were especially successful with the pound notes they produce revealing the little known story of how this could have brought the British economy to its knees at the end of the war.

The counterfeiting prisoners live in relatively luxurious conditions at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp while others at the same camp are left to starve and live in filth.  At the shocking end, the deprived prisoners confront their well fed colleagues and we expect a blood bath to ensue.  Instead, peace is made and most of our heroes survive.

""Making of"" features provide useful additional information which tell us that the Bank of England had to suspend printing some of its standard currency for a time after the war since over 130 million pounds of counterfeits were in circulation thanks to the Nazis.  The counterfeits were so well made that only top experts could tell them from the real thing; also, that some are even being recovered today from a lake in Switzerland where they were dumped after the war ended.

There are also extended interviews with the producer/director/writer, key stars, and the man on whom so much of the story is based, Adolph Burger.  These add quite a bit to understanding the real-life basis of the show and demonstrate the indomitable courage of Mr. Burger in telling his story.  It is an important one.

Although this movie is generally well done and holds your interest the whole way one wonders why some of the gratuitous violence and sex were left in while some worthy scenes were dropped.  The latter show connections between the characters and were not that long.  This is while scenes were left in like the murderous SS seargent urinating on the head of the lead character while he was cleaning up the latrine.  Another gross scene occurs when this same SS seargent kills the young Russian inmate who had contracted tuberculosis.  The seargent tells the other prisoners he was protecting them from infection but they and we are unconvinced.

Moreover, we didn't see much justice done at the end.  We kept waiting for the same SS seargent or the camp commandant to get their final desserts but that never happened.  If the producer/director/writer wanted to show the futility and meaninglessness of if all, you'd have to say he succeeded.  While acting and production values are of the first order we were left without a positive closing to the story.  Yes, it was educational and we could see why it would win awards but it could have been better with a little more thought.  Since Mr. Burger was brought in as a key advisor on the project you'd think he would have insisted on positive footnotes.  The Allies did win the war and their economies didn't collapse.  Finally, many top Nazis were brought to justice for the crimes, not only at Nuremberg, but elsewhere in Germany and Europe.  It wouldn't have taken much more to make these points and leave the audience with a feeling that some justice had been done.",1229731200,,3307,4.85204991087344
3094765,4,B0012QE4PI,"For Sally (or Salomon), a Russian jew, business was good in 1932 Germany.  While Nazism was on the rise, that only meant there was a growing need for false papers -- and he was the reputed ""king of the counterfeiters.""  He had no interest in politics, and thought he could avoid suspicion by being clever.  It turned out he was wrong.  He is captured and finds that his skill as an artist and ultimately his abilities as a counterfeiter make him valuable, but only as long as he is able to convince his fellow prisoners to  help him deliver the goods.

This is a strong film, quite gripping from start to finish.  I don't think it breaks any genuinely new ground, and it doesn't feel completely unique.  But it is a strong story, well worth telling.  The cinematography is unique, combining mostly low-key lighting with a range of tones, and making sparing but consistent use of handheld camera movements throughout, adding both a sense of realism and a feeling of invasiveness.  The use of music in the early scenes avoids sentimentality -- it is intended to evoke an era and give a sense of character rather than to create an artificial feeling of sympathy.

What makes the film work is that Sally and his fellow inmates are not presented as saints or heroes or even victims.  They are resourceful individuals in a terrible situation, and they make the best of it -- but the moral questions that face them are not clear: on the one hand, by carrying out the work the Nazis have asked of them they are saving their own lives, but on the other hand they are supporting the war.  The film does not judge whether they do wrong to continue living.  As Sally says (roughly) ""I won't allow the Nazis to make me feel ashamed for wanting to live.""

3094778,3,B0012QE4PI,"The German-Austrian film The Counterfeiters is based on a remarkable true story. Late in World War Two the Nazis rounded up Jews who had been confined in various concentration camps and set up a large counterfeiting operation designed to undermine the British and U.S. economies. The Nazis found some 150 Jews with the necessary skills and put them together in a special section within the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, providing the latest money-making equipment, giving them plenty of food and comfortable accommodations. But the counterfeiters were constantly pressured to produce (at pain of death) and there were sadistic S.S. guards who cruelly reminded the counterfeiters that they were still in Hell.

Just outside the counterfeiters' quarters other prisoners were brutalized by the Nazis. In one incident, a group of the counterfeiters can hear a guard insulting a man as he executes him. The bullets fly through the very wooden wall next to which they are standing.

It's an important and compelling story. But much of the film was shot with a hand-held that often awkwardly jumps from actor to actor in prolonged scenes. In one of the DVD special features writer-director Stefan Ruzowitzky asserted that he was trying to create a documentary effect. I think he failed at this. It all comes off as too contrived.

The main character is Saloman ""Sally"" Sorowitsch, portrayed very energetically by Karl Markovics. Sally is a very clever, tough, wily man who jerkily moves about like a bantam rooster surrounded by mean foxes. His eyes dart from tormentor to tormentor. Too much eye-darting, if such a thing is possible. Markovics likes to strike a pose, as do the other key players, both victims and tormentors. They are quite good at striking poses, but enough is enough.

I recommend the audio commentary by Ruzowitzky. He addresses some of the things I wondered about, like the sometimes bizarre soundtrack. The interview given by Adolf Burger is very touching. Now in his nineties, he is a survivor of the counterfeiters. Burger was a consultant on the film. He has devoted decades of his life to keeping the memory of the Holocaust and the counterfeiting operation alive.

Although this film received the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, I would not rate it so highly. It just did not seem ""genuine,"" somewhat like a good counterfeit.",1224979200,6,2369,5.079691516709511
3094779,5,B0012QE4PI,"Until watching this movie, I had no idea that the largest counterfeiting operation of all time was carried out by prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp.  They were assigned to forge pounds and dollars, in order to undermine the Allied economy and finance the Nazi war effort.  They ended up printing over 100 million pounds sterling, which even the Bank of England could not distinguish from the genuine article.  On the other hand, as a result of stalling tactics, they didn't crack the dollar until the war was almost over and it no longer made any difference.

This movie is a fictionalized version of this story.  Prisoners with relevant skills are brought in to a special, top-secret area in a concentration camp, where in contrast to the appalling conditions elsewhere, they are provided with sufficient food, decent beds, time for breaks, etc.  But if they don't produce results, they will be shot.  Sorowich, a master counterfeiter, is brought in to take charge of the counterfeiting operation.  Burger, one of the other workers on the operation, wants to sabotage the operation, so as to hamper the Nazi war effort.  This view is not popular among the other workers, who do not feel like dying for this cause, just so that other workers can be brought in to do the job for them.  Much of the movie is a dramatization of this moral argument.  The end result is to delay the production of the dollar just enough.  The protagonist is Sorowich, who initially just wants to save his skin, and also has a personal longing to crack the dollar, but eventually sort of comes around to the other point of view.

The movie is very well done.  The acting is excellent, especially the actors who play Sorowich, and Herzog, the boss of the concentration camp.  One is really immersed in the concentration camp, which is quite scary, although not nearly as gruesome as it could be since we are in the elite section.

The bonus features are worth watching and tell more about the true story on which the movie is based.  For example, in reality, only two people knew about the sabotage, unlike in the movie where for dramatic purposes lots of people knew about it so that they could argue about it on screen.",1224547200,,2202,4.692708333333333

The real, historic story about the counterfeiters is interesting, but the film doesn't do it justice. I only watched it to the bitter end, because I tried to understand why this movie got so much praise in the German press. I still don't understand. There are much better Holocaust movies. This is more like an action film that happens to play between 1933 and 1945. It has no subtlety, the characters are not developed, it feels like a manga version.",1222992000,12,740,4.834645669291339
3094786,5,B0012QE4PI,"Instead of making another depressing Holocaust film, writer/director Stefan Rozuwitzky chose to create an ensemble drama to examine the strength of conscience vs staying alive. Some names were changed, and a few facts, too, but the resulting film is devastating in its narrative. The central character, ""Sally"" Sorowitch (the amazing Karl Markovics) is the main character, thrown into various concentration camps, until he arrives at Sachsenhausen, where he's treated better than elsewhere. He's a master counterfeiter who is expected to help the Nazi's get money to both finance their further war effort, and destroy the economies of Britain & the US. There isn't much more to say without blabbing away plot stuff, but the screenplay is based on fellow inmate/forger Adolf Burger's memoir (played with profound sincerity by August Diehl). Burger, actually, was ready to go along with the Nazi demands, but here he's played as the conscience of the whole film.  The central character of ""Sally"" was actually based on a man named Smolianoff (but he didn't emerge famous and ended up forging passports for Jews who wanted to go to Palestine). David Striesow should be commended for his smarmy performance as Commandant Herzog. It's hard to say more here, but I recommend this film highly, for an inside perspective. The DVD extras are super-plentiful, and director Rozuwitsky explains that many things needed to be changed for legal reasons; he also wanted to present a German film about conscience (regarding the Holocaust). The surprise Oscar winner for Foreign Language film should be seen as another lesson about what greed, power and ambivalence can to to the world at large.",1222560000,,1678,5.214814814814815

Many German people risked their lives helping Jewish people who were unjustly persecuted. This film showed yet another side of this inhuman time period,  and it was an engaging portrayal of the economic plot happening behind the scenes of the bombs and atrocities.

3094799,5,B0012QE4PI,"There are hundreds of movies about the Holocaust and most of them detail the unbelievable horrors of totalitarianism and racism.  What makes this film stand apart is that it gives us a story of morally complex individuals who don't have the luxury of making easy choices between good and evil.

Imagine, if you will, being given a chance at life, even a tolerably good life, in the bowels of Hell. But in order to live, you have to betray all those fighting to end that evil, brutal world.  A few select men in the Sachsenhausen camp are given that choice...and (according to the film) they choose to live, even if some will become morally bankrupt in doing so. The most interesting personality of course, is the main protoganist - the best counterfeiter in Germany - who is a Jew (yes) but also a criminal type. According to his code of honor, which he translates into the concentration camp, a person may fake millions of bank notes to help the German regime continue to oppress, but one cannot squeal or compromise another prisoner - whatever the reason.  The counterfeiter  even secretly relishes the idea of accomplishing the impossible...heading the most daring money forgery operation in human history.  Opposing him is a Russian idealist who believes that he must, absolutely must, sabotage the operation in order to bring the Nazi regime down.  I was absolutely thrilled by Karl Marcovich's performance - subtle, nuanced, ruthless, and at times heart-breakingly compassionate.  To those wary of seeing another Holocaust film, I say, this one's different...go see it.",1221177600,,1575,4.984732824427481

3094801,4,B0012QE4PI,"I purchased this movie because a friend of mine is the son of a master engraver who created the forged British banknotes during WWII.  When I saw the movie I was quite surprised with its involvement with the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.  The engraver that I knew about was a German civilian.  Nevertheless, the DVD contains an interview with the Russian engraver who was the main character in this verson of the story of this counterfeiting operation.  It is my conjecture that the task of the German Government in this project was too important to their economy to perform the forgery in only one location or facility.  This movie portrays a most unusual take on life in a German concentration camp, Sachsenhausen. The creation of an elite group of master engravers to carry out this operation was totally exceptional to expected camp life.  Instead of fear of the guards, poor food or starvation, and bad quarters, these prisoners were given good civilian clothes probably taken from others who were less fortunate.  They slept on beds with cotton sheets, and ate high quality food.  They had classical music played on the phonograph while they worked at their printing tasks.  While the story was a good story dealing with the tensions between prisoners from differing ethnic, social, and political backgrounds (The villian was a communist who tried to sabotage operations).  This makes a good plot for a movie, but from another friend of mine who had been in the Dachau Camp, the prisoners were sorted into four categories; common criminals, political prisoners (my friend), prisoners who were candidates for ethnic cleansing, and finally the insane, crippled, or medically defective individuals.  They wore a distinctive uniform peculiar to each category, and probably did not mix very much socially.  The Russian engraver fitted the criminal category well and had been arrested for forging passports and travel papers. The movie had minor technical problems.  The printing equipment used was not of sufficient quality to print bank notes. A scene of the prisoners dancing in celebration used dance movements appropriate to the 1960's.  Nevertheless, the movie portrayed a very believeable story of a technical secret operation of the German Government that is closely held even today.

3094802,4,B0012QE4PI,the movie focuses on a true piece of nazi's and jewish history during the second WW.  The acting was excellent that portrayed a group of men who became part of the nazi's funding plan by forging the english pounds and other documents like passports.  Although the story is based in the concentration camp and in places the story took some gruelsome turns; it was another sad protrayal of human behavior and yet the human spirit to come through all of it.  A truely remarkable movie.,1220054400,,482,4.647058823529412
3094803,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is a dramatization one of the largest counterfeiting operations in history, a top secret Nazi initiative called ""Operation Bernhardt"" that operated out of Blocks 18 and 19 of the Sachenhaussen concentration camp using prisoners with expertise in forgery and printing to counterfeit over 132 million during World War II. The film is based on the book ""The Devil's Workshop"" by Adolf Burger, who consulted on director Stefan Ruzowitzky's screenplay. Burger was a political prisoner from Prague, a printer by profession, who was among the prisoners in the counterfeiting program at Sachenhaussen. The story in the film is heavily fictionalized to make it more of a morality play than a history lesson, and most names have been changed for legal reasons. But the story of the operation and sabotage are true.

Salomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics) is living the high life in Berlin of the 1930s, financed by the money he makes forging documents, which are much in demand as war looms. He's arrested by an officer of the Berlin counterfeiting squad and sent to prison but later transferred to a concentration camp, because he is Jewish. Another transfer to Sachenhaussen allows Sally to escape those dreadful conditions. There, he is introduced to a diverse group of prisoners who have been given the task of counterfeiting the British pound and American dollar by none other than his arresting officer, now Sturmbannfuhrer Herzog (Devid Striesow). Sally is grateful for the relatively comfortable living conditions and amenable to the challenge of his work, but another prisoner, Adolf Burger (August Diehl), feels that they should sabotage the Nazi counterfeiting effort.

Liberties taken with the real story may account for ""The Counterfeiters"" poor reception in Germany and Austria. The rest of the world seemed more willing to focus on the fascinating counterfeiting operation and (fictional) moral quandary of the prisoners. There is a lot to like in Ruzowitzky's script. Instead of the usual innocent bourgeois perspective on life inside a concentration camp, Sally is a career criminal, accustomed to being in prison. Instead of conflict between Nazis and prisoners, the conflict is within the prisoners themselves: Should we help the Nazi war effort to save our lives? ""The Counterfeiters"" offers the perspective of prisoners who, briefly, had a relatively cushy situation but feared a return to their previous nightmare. Sally's survival instinct and his convict's commitment to never rat out a fellow inmate come into conflict at Sachenhaussen, which makes a good story. In German with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Sony 2008): Bonus features are in English or in German with subtitles, as noted. ""The Making of The Counterfeiters"" (10 min, German)  interviews director Ruzowitzky, Adolf Burger, and the cast, with some discussion of the real events. ""Interviews"" are with Stefan Ruzowitzky (18 min, English), Adolf Burger (10 min, German), and actor Karl Markovics (10 min, English). In ""Adolf Burger's Artifacts"" (19 min, German), Burger talks about the counterfeiting, sabotage, life in the camp, the real Sally, and shows us some mementos. ""Q&A with director Stefan Ruzowitzky (13 min, English) takes questions from the audience at AFI Filmfest. There is a good, constant feature commentary by Stefan Ruzowitzky that discusses photography, editing, filming, fictional elements, and more. And there is a theatrical trailer and 4 deleted scenes. To hear the true story of Operation Bernhardt, the best feature is ""Adolf Burger's Artifacts"". For the director's explanation of his intentions, watch the 18-minute interview.

3094804,4,B0012QE4PI,"There were seldom easy choices during The Holocaust.  Survival meant everything, and those who did live past World War II had fascinating and harrowing stories to share.  Such is the case of ladies' man and counterfeiter, Solomon Sarowitsch (Kal Makovics).

When an S.S. agent catches ""Sally`s"" fake U.S. dollars, he puts him in a concentration camp.  Savvy and a gifted artist, he creates a flattering pencil portrait of an SS figure head.  From there he gets a ticket to more bearable living conditions, including soft bunk-beds and livable food rations.  He does more portraits, including an outside mural until an officer announces his deportation to another camp.  Easily perturbed by the change in plans, he discovers the Nazis have bigger fish for him to fry.

At the new concentration camp, he encounters Holst (Martin Brambach), the officer who arrested him.  The new camp still provides livable conditions including operatic music during work, but his new assignment is to create the most authentic counterfeit currency from the allies' side, making pounds and later dollars.

Always desperate and under pressure, Sally's collected spirit is at odds with communist co-worker, Burger (August Diehl), who insists they ""sabotage"" the operation, noting that replenished funds could help the Nazis win the war.  No easy dilemma, dissention hits within the group as Sally tries to keep informants from squealing while keeping a young lascivious friend from being detected for his infectious tuberculosis.  Pressured by Herzog (Devid Stricson), a less menacing SS officer and a key bargaining chip, Sally must decide if he must do what is practical to survive or bend to Burger who sees his plan as the only way to help all.

While the presentation of 'The Counterfeiters' is easily more tightly presented and creates more tangible Nazi tension than '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Book/dp/B000TGCR38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Book</a>,' it's hard to say this Holocaust film has the same impact as some finer ones like `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Au-Revoir-Les-Enfants/dp/630121613X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Au Revoir Les Enfants</a>'.

Best of all, 'The Counterfeiters' provides a great story and tells it well.

3094805,5,B0012QE4PI,"Operation Bernhard was a secret Nazi counterfeit scheme and one of the lesser-known events of WWII.  A group of Jewish printers, engravers, graphic artists, and commercial photographers were rounded up and taken to Sachsenhausen where a counterfeiting factory was set up specifically to produce English Pound notes and later, US dollars, with the Nazi goal of flooding and destabilizing Britain's economy.  The resulting notes were so expertly manufactured that Nazi spies had them validated by the Bank of England, which confirmed them as authentic.  ""The Counterfeiters"" (Die Flscher) is based on this true story.

The film opens in Monte Carlo after WWII.  Salomon Sorowitsch (Sally) has a case filled with bank notes, which he carelessly spends at a posh hotel.  The story flashes back to 1936 Berlin when Sally was a master forgerer and artist with a thriving underground business.  He is captured by the Nazi police and taken to a hard labor camp where he cheats death by drawing portraits of SS officers.  Five years later, he is moved to a concentration camp, Sachsenhausen, where he is ordered to supervise the production of what amounted to 132M in counterfeit notes.

Sally is a realist and much as he is sickened by the Nazi's atrocities, he works hard at perfecting their product for no other purpose than self-preservation.  ""One adapts or dies,"" he says.  The group is housed separately from other prisoners and is given sheets, soap, and clothing. Their participation, however, did not guarantee them their lives.  To fully grasp the hopelessness, author Lawrence Malkin wrote in his book, ""Krueger's Men,"" an account of this same story:  ""[The SS planned to keep the operation secret by killing them when the job was done. The prisoners worked with the knowledge that they were marked for death when they had finished their jobs.]  From the start, they wondered whether they should stretch out their work and risk execution for sabotage, or perform efficiently and thus hasten their own deaths.""

The cries and shots from beyond their barracks can be distinctly heard and the group still suffers occasional beatings and humiliations by the SS.  A young idealist and printer, Adolf Burger, whose wife was killed in Auschwitz, incites the group to sabotage the counterfeiting operations, arguing that they are party to the financing of the Nazi war effort.  Sally manages to abort Burger's plans, insisting that dying for a principle is worthless.  Despite being a swindler, Sally protected his mates as best as he could and refused to betray anyone of them, going so far as to barter with his barracks commandant for medicine for a sick mate and lying to save another's life.

This story survived because Adolf Burger survived.  He is 90 years old and still lectures about the Holocaust and Operation Bernhard in Prague, and served as consultant in the film.  It does have an incredible level of authenticity to it.  Karl Markovics as Sally was just superb.  With very little outward emotion, he is able to project the nightmarish life in Sachsenhausen, where one mistake could mean the end of your life.  He is clearly torn by his need to survive and the tragedies of his mates--Burger's wife and another's children killed by the Nazis--as well as the killings of prisoners beyond their barracks.  His moments of grief are quite touching.  The young August Diehl as Burger is excellent, too, and his idealistic stance was an effective contrast to Sally's pragmatism.  Two very different men with divergent approaches, but both courageous and inspiring.  When the story returns to Monte Carlo, Sally does something unexpected that's a fitting end to the story.

I really think it's a perfect film.  There's not a single thing I can find fault with.  It's a quality drama about the moral dilemmas prisoners grappled with when faced daily with the prospect of death, and how wrenching these choices were.  It certainly deserved its Oscar as best Foreign Language Film in 2007.

DVD extras are: The Making of..., Interview with the director, Adolf Burger's Artifacts, and a Q&A with the director, all worth seeing as they provide an even deeper understanding of the true story of Operation Bernhard (named after the scheme's instigator, SS officer Bernhard Krueger).  It's an excellent and compelling story and highly recommended.

3094806,5,B0012QE4PI,"Before World War II broke out, the Russian-born Jew Salomon Sorowitsch earned a well-deserved reputation as ""the most charming scoundrel in Berlin."" The Nazis arrested him as ""the world's best counterfeiter"" and sent him to Sachsenhausen where they forced him to forge identification cards, passports, documents, bank notes, and money. Lots of money, as in millions of pounds that the Nazis flooded into the British economy to destabilize its currency. The film focuses on Sorowitsch's role, but includes the many other Jews in the concentration camp whose skills as engravers, printers, and graphic artists landed them in a life of relative luxury that included clean beds, food, medicine, opera music and even a ping pong table. Avoiding extermination was one thing; betraying fellow Jews and, in effect, financing the Nazi war effort was another. All sorts of moral complexities plague these inmates, none more so than when one of their own sabotages their counterfeiting work on the American dollar.

3328908,5,B0012QE4PI,"Die F&auml;lscher (The Counterfeiters) deserves its Oscar as the Best Foreign Film of 2007. Based on a true story and singed with horrifying details of the Nazi treatment of 'detainees' (primarily Jews) during WW II, the inner story of this film is one of resilience and survival against near impossible odds and how one man turned his criminal gifts into a system so impressive that he served as a 'provider' of funds to the financially depleted Third Reich war effort.  The story is in itself fascinating enough to hold our interest for the duration of the film, but it is the incredibly ingenious and wily character of Salomon 'Sally' Sorowitsch that burns a space in our minds of how one man survived the concentration camps and in his own way helped fellow Jews to likewise survive the Holocaust.

Salomon 'Sally' Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics) is a brilliant counterfeiter, a Russian Jew so gifted in his ability to forge documents such as passports that he is able to live the 'good life' - money, women, gambling, etc. - until he is arrested by the Nazis and placed in a detention camp Sachsenhausen north of Berlin.  His facile mind sees his possible extermination and leads him to make a deal with the Nazis to spare his life (and the lives of his elected doomed accomplices) in return for making counterfeit money (British pounds)  so desperately needed to fill the coffers of the dwindling Nazi resources.  He and his confreres are afforded comfortable living space, good foods, and other amenities in a special sector of the concentration camp, a place where they can spend their time turning out volumes of money for the Nazis. In this way many of these 'selected' men manage to stay alive until the war is over, but the 'hero' character of Sally Sorowitsch remains an enigma of sorts: his cunning ideas are basically self centered and his focus remains on his own survival and ultimate gratification of yet another successful counterfeit business.  In other words, his story leaves a feeling of uneasiness with the viewer - is this a survivor to admire or is this a 'player' whose sense of compassion is marred by his own selfish goals?  The viewer is left to decide.

Though Karl Markovics is very strong in the leading role, the supporting cast of some of Germany's finest actors brings a depth of humanity and perception to the major issue the film addresses - both death and survival in the onerous concentration camps of the Nazis. Director/screenwriter Stefan Ruzowitzky deserves kudos for the manner in which he shows both sides of the seminal situation.  His cinematographer Benedict Neuenfels manages to capture the lurid light of the confined men and makes the intolerable almost tolerable to watch: the haunting musical score by Marius Ruhland completes the atmosphere.  This is a powerful movie on every level, but it is a very disturbing film in many ways.  It will make the viewer think - and that is most definitely a strong point of this film.

3328909,5,B0012QE4PI,"An incredible film that received an outstanding transfer to Blu - complete with the first disclaimer (I have seen) about the quality on the Blu case. In fine print under the 1080p/True HD specs: ""This film employs a variety of film stocks and grain structures in order to tell the story. This intentional visual style has been retained for this high definition presentation, as per the filmmaker's intent."" An obvious undertaking was fulfilled in making this film as I counted 18 film and movie studios/distributors shown on the case. The content has been reviewed quite thoroughly here so I went with checking the Blu angles.

Technical: The transfer was as flawless as I have seen with Blu, and each scene that ""retained the grain"" looked even better. The majority of what makes this Blu release a good owner is the special features and menu content navigation. My PS3 was made to upgrade to the 2.30 for this BD, but after that 8 minutes of installing and rebooting, navigation was seamless. The menu icons all moved when each selection is made and arrival to those items is very fast, on the S301 though it glitched itself to death with all of these same selections. While watching any of the low def special features in other BDs, I typically cannot access any menu items with the pop-up button, but in this case two opts always arrived (menu and close).

Content: The special features contain a goldmine of historical information and interviews for those with history interests. Between the Adolf Burger's Historical Artifacts piece, and the Interviews with real-life counterfeiter Adolf Burger (with Director) and the actors, all make for a  thorough re-telling of this story. The Making-of docu was well made, and the commentary was informative. The deleted scenes were roughly 6 minutes, and contained at least one powerful moment that I wish would have been in the film.

3328910,5,B0012QE4PI,"This 2007 Austrian film won an Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film of the year.  I can well understand why.  Startling, somber and disturbingly haunting, it is based on the true story of a Jewish criminal counterfeiter who was imprisoned by the Nazis. The film is brilliantly directed by Stefan Ruzowitz, who manages to humanize both the prisoners and the Nazis.

Karl Markovics is cast as Salomon Sorowich.  We first meet him after the war, visiting an upscale Monte Carlo casino with a briefcase full of American money.  There is then a flashback to 1936, when we see him as a successful counterfeiter who, for a fee, specializes in providing foreign passports for those who are trying to get out of Germany. He is arrested and sent to a concentration camp.  He manages to survive in awful conditions by drawing flattering portraits of the concentration camp guards.  He is so good at it that he is provided with the materials to do portraits of the guards and their families.

This privileged status in the camps comes to an end, however, when he is taken to another concentration camp where he and a select group of prisoners, which includes printers and graphic artists, are forced to produce counterfeit English pounds and American dollars for the Nazis.  Here, they are given privileges unknown to other inmates.  Their food is good, they sleep on beds with sheets and blankets, and their work conditions mirror those of a real print shop in the outside world.  Salomon Sorowich thrives in this atmosphere.  However, Aldoph Berger, played by August Diehl, another prisoner who believes in Communist ideals, accuses Sorowich of ""selling his soul"" and does everything in his power to sabotage the effort.  Somehow, the English pound is produced, but the counterfeiting of the American dollar project lags behind.  The prisoners all want to stay alive and would like to kill the Communist because no matter how luxurious their treatment, they all know they can be shot at any time.  How this all plays out is stuff that high drama is made of.  It kept be on the edge of my seat the whole time.

I did some research on this film which was adapted from a memoir of the Communist who, after the war, suffered periods of depression and later committed suicide.  Salomon Sorowich, however, escaped to Argentina where he continued his counterfeiting lifestyle by forging works of art.

This is not a film for everyone.  It is sad and disturbing.  But I do highly recommend it because it is a fine film with great acting, a well-paced storyline, and an extremely thought provoking theme.",1215820800,15,2597,4.830316742081448
3328911,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is a deliberately-paced, affecting personal drama about how thorny ethical dilemmas are in real life, and won a deserved Best Foreign Language Film award at the Oscars in 2008. The main character is Salomon Sorowitsch, a Russian Jew who is arrested for counterfeiting in 1939 and sent to a concentration camp. His artistic skill is quickly picked up, however, and he is eventually used in a counterfeiting operation known as Operation Bernhard, a plan to de-stabilize the British economy by flooding it with counterfeit currency. Since Sorowitsch is such a master at counterfeiting, he is able to pull off a perfect re-production of Bank of England notes that pass the inspection of even the highest inspectors. So the SS now turn their counterfeiting operation to the Dollar. Another inmate involved in the counterfeiting operation, Adolf Burger, realizes that they are effectively financing the Nazi war effort, and believes that a massive printing of counterfeit dollars could make a serious difference in the war. Burger begins destroying the negatives, and wants Sorowitsch to sabatoge the whole operation. This puts Sorowitsch in a dilemma- if the Nazis find out about the sabatoge, then all the counterfeiting inmates, who enjoy a comparatively privileged and comfortable life, will be sent to the death camps. If they continue with the operation, they will help the Nazis.

Which is more important- ensuring your own survival, or fighting for a just cause at the possible cost of your life? ""The Counterfeiters"" shows that such a dilemma is very difficult to resolve in one's day-to-day struggles, especially when great duress and oppression is present. The moral complexity of the movie is stunning. Whether the counterfeiters delaying tactics were what led to the Nazis' downfall or not, they did a very brave thing, and this movie does a great service in bringing their story to the public.",1211846400,13,1922,5.2

This sets up the dilemma presented in this film; do we aid or do we revolt?  Both still may mean certain death!

Director Stefan Ruzowitzky, whose previous big score was the bleak&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inheritors/dp/B000PC72FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inheritors</a>, takes Adolf Burger's memoir and creates a dramatic and socially conscious film about complicity and the moral conscience about, in this case, Jews, thrown in to the camps, and their reactions to their situation.  This is not so much a Holocaust epic as it is an intimate 90- minute micro look at one certain point of concentration camp history. What this film does well is to clearly present both sides of two Jewish men caught in an impossible situation who examine their options and have to make decisions.

So many other films have preceded ""The Counterfeiters"" that have presented this same moral dilemma of Concentration Camp inmates who must make similar decisions.  Though ""The Counterfeiters"" is good, other films I would suggest are far superior in developing this same theme:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Ashes/dp/B0001DMW9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Ashes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grey-Zone/dp/B000087EYX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grey Zone</a>, and most especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playing-for-Time/dp/6301025571/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playing for Time</a>.

The old axiom ""do or die"" is tested to the limits in all of these books and films.  ""The Counterfeiters"" is but another take on moral conscience vs. complicity and cooperation.

3328914,4,B0012QE4PI,"Oscar-winning (Best Foreign Language Film) ""The Counterfeiters"" is inspired by true events during World War II. Some of the main characters of the Austrian/German film are based on real persons and one of them Adolf Burger, a Slovak typographer, wrote a memoir ""The Devil's Workshop"" which became the basis of the film. Burger's book is about ""Operation Bernhard,"" Nazi's secret plans of forging English and American currency. Against the background of one of the largest counterfeiting schemes in history, Director Stefan Ruzowitzky (best known for his medical suspense ""Anatomy"" starring Franka Potente) has successfully created a tense thriller with powerful moments.

The film centers on Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), forger of documents. After being arrested in pre-war Berlin, a Russian Jew Solomon Sorowitsch is sent to a concentration camp. We discover though Salomon is not a heroic figure, he is clever. He learns to survive the horrible conditions of life there by drawing portraits of Nazi officers.

But more drastic change awaits him when he is later put in charge of one secret mission conducted by Nazis code-named ""Operation Bernhard"" - Salomon and other inmates (mostly Jewish prisoners) are confined in an inner section at Sachsenhausen concentration camp and are ordered to forge British bank notes.

One thing is certain. They must succeed. They also know Nazi officers would not wait long. But to succeed means to prolong the war and some of the fellow counterfeiters are aware of that too. This is where Adolf Burger (brilliant August Diehl) steps in, insisting on sabotage even though the delay could mean their death.

""The Counterfeiters"" is not only a gripping thriller; it also poses some questions about what we would and should do in most extreme situation. I only add that in his interview Adolf Burger said (he visited Japan in November 2007) that the episodes about the inmates playing ping pong and singing songs before the Nazi officers are both true.

Perhaps this moral dilemma of Salomon represented by Salomon and Adolf could have been explored more. Some scenes of the film are obviously the results of fictionalizing process on the side of filmmakers who wanted more dramatic moments. The film is certainly flawed, but, supported by unanimously great acting (Karl Markovics as Salomon Sorowitsch is stunning), ""The Counterfeiters"" is a gripping and fascinating thriller and drama.",1205193600,32,2428,5.263565891472868
3328915,4,B0012QE4PI,"The New Germany and Austria by extension have been in the process, these past several years, of divesting themselves of National Guilt in regards to the atrocities of World War 2: ""Sophie Scholl,"" ""Downfall"" and also the superb ""Lives of Others"" (though set in post WWII East Berlin, it reeks of submission and totalitarianism) speak to the redemptive qualities of confession and penance.
And now we have ""The Counterfeiters,"" the story of Solomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), a Russian-born Jew who spends his life forging documents thereby attaining the reputation of a master counterfeiter. Ultimately he is arrested and sent to a Camp at which he is given the assignment of forging the British Pound note for The Third Reich. This is 1945 and the disastrous German War effort is in dire need of cash to carry on its war effort.
""Counterfeiters"" is all about survival and to what means we, as human beings will do to comply in order to live: anything pretty much sums it up and anything pretty much is the reality of our collective desire to live despite the cicumstances.
Director Stefan Ruzowitzky is walking a slippery slope here as the counterfeiting was done in the Nazi concentration camp at Sachsenhausen and the technicians involved were almost all Jews, ""The Counterfeiters"" raises some provocative moral dilemmas.
Also, the Sorowitsch of Markovics is no paragon of honor. Instead he is a squirrelly, only thinking for himself, con man. He's happy to do what the Nazi's ask of him in order to get the perks of his ""exalted position"" in Sachsenhausen: clean clothes, good food, soft bedding, and weekly hot showers. ""The Counterfeiters"" begins with a post war sequence of Sorowitsch spending thousands of counterfeit British Pounds in Monte Carlo: gambling, grooming himself, dining, dating...basically enjoying the fruits of his labors and those of his fellow counterfeiters.
Sorowitsch is one who feels that: ""Only by surviving can we defeat them.""
""The Counterfeiters"" is a difficult film to like but ultimately it speaks to something in all of us: the drive, the desperate need to survive despite the circumstances in which we might find ourselves. Sorowitsch is flawed, a nasty piece of work actually but he's intelligent, crafty and grudgingly and ultimately deserving of our respect.",1204416000,38,2301,5.122340425531915

This movie is about this guy who is famous for forging fake money, passport, and checks of all kind.
The is a Jew born in Russia and during the Nazi period, the Nazi heppens to arrest him and put him in a camp for jews.
But the place where he was in was far from other jews. It was luxurious and full of plenty of stuff.
Although some of the nazi's treat them bad, the top officer who happens to be the one who arrested him treated him decently.

There he forged different kinds of moneys, checks to back up nazi for war budget. The German's are having hard time to having war and they did need money.

The movie was extremely well made.
The acting of Tim Breyvogei and all the others are so well done and even after the show, I still remembered their faces clearly. They were so lovable.
The young guy who end of being sick and died by nazi who shot him to kill, the guy who's wife is in Auschwitz, I think it was, wanted to conqure them and rull over the camp, and others.

And I shoul never forget about the beautiful exotic music by Hugo Daz along with harmonica tunes it was just so great to hear.
Try this.

If you think this is just another movie like <Schendler's List>, you are totally wrong. This movie is far from it and in some way it is way better. The movie never pushed us to feel what they felt like Shendler's List did. You know Spielberg.

The director already made a lot of good movies by the time he made this one and you can feel it by watching this film.

It's obviously intentional for this 2007 film and is very effective in giving it a sort of you are there back then feel.  This an Austrian film with the language spoken in German, with the occasional bit of Russian.  Subtitles are in English and this is easy to read film.  I had never heard of this story from World War II and am glad this film was made to tell it, as it's an interesting part of history.  Basically a career criminal is sent to a concentration camp where his arrestor who has now been promoted, is in charge and has grand plans for his skillset.  Salomon isn't your typical nice guy in a bad situation, he's a very self preservation person who at the start of the film states something along the lines that he doesn't care for the problems others Jewish people are facing as it's up to each person to control what they get out of life, but he does seem to develop a bit of a conscious as his incarceration goes on.  This realistic lack of Hollywood hero type character means, combined with the fact you the viewer are unlikely to have heard of this story before viewing, means you don't really know what moral decisions he (and the other prisoners) will make.

Although the graphic and dreadful situation of the concentration camps isn't shown as heavy as other films, The Counterfeiters still has enough scenes every now and again reminding you of the horror or the situation for the prisoners.

What makes the film so enormously likable and well done is the convinging methodology used by the actors and producers to produce as much convincing atmosphere of the final days of WWII as possible. The nazis in charge of the camp operations where the counterfeiting is taking place also realize something else which some of their inmates have already been secretly suspecting - the British and Americans may be causing their own economies to collapse by sleepwalking - which to them could mean victory over the Allies even if the Allies themselves, in collaboration with the Russians officially win the war. As the film reaches it's climax the nazis lose control of the camp which results in it's liberation by the inmates.

3329133,5,B0012QE4PI,"******* NOTE: I try to avoid spoilers in the comments below *****

Before I saw this movie and read some historical background on it, I had never heard of Operation Bernhard, the Nazi plan to flood the Allied Countries with counterfeit pounds and dollars, and to establish a counterfeit production station in the concentration camp of Sachsenhausen, manned by prisoners, some of them Jews, who had skills in printing and counterfeiting. Based on a book by one of the counterfeiters, Adolf Burger, the movie focuses on Salomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), a Jewish forger, who is arrested just before the World War 2 and imprisoned. He impresses his captors with his skill as an artist, so when Operation Bernhard is conceived, Sally is moved to Sachsenhausen and effectively put in charge of the counterfeiting operation.

The movie's interest is in Sally's moral consciousness. He's keeping himself alive -- and in relatively comfortable conditions -- but he's also helping keep his fellow prisoners alive. The counterfeiters all know that there is a whole other population in the camp who are treated with great cruelty and arbitrariness. But the counterfeiters also know that they are ""helping"" the Nazis, whose politics they despise, and to the extent that Operation Bernhard works, they could well be prolonging the war. So there's the makings of a moral dilemma here -- for if one sabotages or in any way slows down the counterfeiting production, one can claim to be fighting the good fight, but one might also be endangering the lives of the other counterfeiters if the Nazis become aware of the deliberate slowing-down.  If one wants to be a martyr, that's one thing -- but who gets to decide that all your fellow-counterfeiters ought to be martyrs too? These moral and existential dilemmas are registered through Sally's relations with his fellow-prisoner Adolf Burger (August Diehl) and with the Camp Commandant, Herzog (Devid Striesow). The counterfeiters manage to produce all the Pounds Sterling the Nazis need, but the US dollar is a harder nut to crack -- and is one of the group sabotaging the effort and thus putting them all in jeopardy?

Markovics plays Sorowitsch as a man of few words and great alertness of mind, and while he is alive to the better chances of survival that his work makes possible, he has to decide how to relate on a human level with prisoners like Burger, who want to resist the Nazis at every turn and see themselves as principled, as well as with the Kommandant, Herzog. Interestingly Burger and Herzog are both much more verbal than Sorowitsch. They articulate their agendas -- and one wonders of Herzog, who has a lot to lose if Operation Bernhard doesn't succeed, whether one can believe him or not. He can seem humane and even sympathetic, but he's also running a camp in which ""normal"" prisoners are very cruelly treated and even killed. Sorowitsch is very guarded with these characters -- and, in fact, with everybody -- and one has to gauge his moral stance as much from what he does or doesn't do as from what he says. Markovics is superb in the role -- and he says so little that the viewer should check out the interview with him among the ""special features,"" where he is articulate and cogent (in English!) about the role, its appeal for him, and his approach to acting in general.

Diehl and Striesow are equally compelling as Burger and Herzog respectively, and indeed the whole cast is splendid. The other prisoner/counterfeiters are presented without resort to stereotype, and their meeting near the end with the ""normal"" prisoners, with whom they have never been allowed to fraternize, is a tense and touching moment. The pictorial qualities are striking too -- the film has a not-too-polished look -- a documentary look? -- that fits the story well. It's tempting to compare this movie to ""Schindler's List,"" and it's less sentimental and less back-and-white. The Kommandant is no obvious monster, although whether or not he is really conflicted about the treatment of the prisoners or merely pretending to be as a means of manipulation is an open question.

The ""framing"" device has Sorowitsch bringing a boatload of money (forged) to Monte Carlo, where on his first night his gambling prowess impresses a lovely young woman, who in bed notices the tattoo on his arm. Switch to the story of life in the camps.

3329204,5,B0012QE4PI,"Incredible dramatic story of Salomon 'Salli' Smolianoff, once known as Europe's 'King Of The Counterfeiters'. (I believe due to legal reasons with his estate, he's renamed Salomon Sorowitsch for the film)

Described by Adolf Burger, writer of novel the movie is based on, as a disreputable character whose shallow and selfish desire for pleasure far outweighed any other concerns in life. Even in the face of a rising fascist state which seemed hellbent on the eradication of his people, Salli continued to party. His planned escape thwarted by shortsighted self-indulgence, he was captured by a Nazi SS team and sent to the concentration camps in 1939.

Like other biopics, there's some question as to the legitimacy describing Sorowitsch/Smolianoff's life. The author Adolf Burger, and fellow Operation Bernhard counterfeiter, met one another in Sachsenhausen concentration camp nearly five years after Salli was captured and did not know the man prior to the camps. However, I'm willing to give credence to his account since Smolianoff did not dispute them; although it's equally possible that he did not know (living in faraway Brazil) or did not care.

Regardless, the events in the camp are unquestionably accurate and have been documented by both allied forces who liberated the camp and the small handful of survivors. Suffice to say - the history of Sachsenhausen is beyond all horrific imaginings; the deviant sadists in charge of the camps were unspeakable devils.

Cast into this nightmare, Sorowitsch displayed a cunning ability to manipulate the situation to the best of his limited advantage. So that, even in the various hellholes he was transferred to, he was able to work his way to a generally sheltered existence; away from the horrors that took place every day and night outside the safe zones for the specially skilled. First as a portrait artist, then creating propaganda images for various camps, finally transferred to Sachsenhausen - specifically to oversee and supervise the top secret counterfeiting project known as Operation Bernhard.

Brilliantly performed by Austrian actor Karl Markovics, who delivers a delicate contradiction between an overwhelmingly self-interested heel, cast against stunning acts of personal bravery and sacrifice for his fellow prisoners. As a viewer you never find a strong enough box to pigeon-hole Sorowitsch - sharing qualities of both creep and hero. Like water, he's a fluid dynamic, breeching the smallest of advantageous openings or letting himself flow around the worst of calamities. Sorowitsch is very human and that makes his portrayal so much more real and compelling.

A profoundly stellar performance in an unforgettable film.

Note: The British Pound Notes that the counterfeiters created were so good, that beginning in 1957 the UK actually had to completely abandon the design, stock, and method of production for their paper money. So perfect were the forgeries that it had threatened to destabilize the British economy more than a decade after the war had officially ended. And it wasn't until a stunning 1981, when the recall of war-era 50 notes was enacted, that Operation Bernhard finally came to an end.",1305244800,,3183,5.291089108910891
3329215,3,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is a German historical-fiction film about Operation Bernhard, a secret operation conducted by the Nazi's during the latter years of World War II in which a team of concentration camp inmates counterfeit large sums of British money in order to fuel the Nazi war effort. The film follows the main character Solomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch, a master counterfeiter, who is arrested by the Nazi's and eventually sent to the Sachsenhausen (""Saxon-house/place"") concentration camp take part in Operation Bernhard. As essentially the prisoner-leader of the Operation, Sally must juggle the strict demands of his Nazi wardens with the determination of a few of his fellow prisoners' attempts to sabotage the Nazi war machine, as well as with the duty he owes to his fellow innocent prisoners to keep the Operation running smoothly and hence keep his mates alive. The result is a story engulfed in a sticky moral dilemma that ends (just in time) with the end of the war and the liberation of the concentration camp.

In my opinion ""The Counterfeiters"" is in between being a good film and a bad film. I thought that there were unnecessary scenes of sexuality and violence; and hence I thought that the film would have been essentially the same without these few scenes. For example, when Sally watches his friend Kolya get shot by a Nazi guard, we (the viewer) see Sally looking through a small window, then the film switches cameras and we see Kolya get shot through the head. Instead of this unnecessary five-second scene of disgusting violence whereby we see the bullet take a piece of flesh out of Kolya's head, I think that the camera should have stayed focused on Sally-looking-through-the-window since the result would still be the same: Kolya is brutally murdered. Instead, the camera switches to let the viewer watch the gruesome scene. Because of this (and several other similar scenes) I thought that ""The Counterfeiters"" was trying too hard to shock the viewer with violence that the viewer knows is simply un-real. Overall, the effect of this violence-saturation was to turn the film into something like a comic book or a wanna-be Schindler's List.

But I digress. I thought that the acting was merely OK as well. The main character seems to have only one facial expression throughout the film, and many of the other characters seem two-dimensional. Also, the soundtrack was strange: a mix of Latin American rhythms seemed to give the film a fake-ish feel. Also, I was somewhat morally confused when the main saboteur (Adolf Burger, played by August Diehl) is hailed as a hero by the concentration camp Jews after they had liberated the camp (after the Germans high-tailed): Burger (whose memoir, I learned from Wikipedia, served as the genesis of the screenplay), through his sabotage activities threatened the lives of the entire counterfeiting team. Perhaps he is shown as a hero because his sabotage slowed down the counterfeiting process, and hence hastened the end of the Third Reich, but I have trouble accepting this (heroism) because Burger had no idea that Sally had the power to prevent the sabotage (i.e. besides snitching on Burger)... But I digress again...

Broadly speaking, I think that we must take films like ""The Counterfeiters"" with a grain of salt, for this film is essentially a success story, while the Holocaust is most definitely not: it was, without a doubt, part of the worst series of events in modern history. While it may be human nature to look for and to find success stories and ""heroes"" in the history of the Holocaust, I think that often such stories serve to reduce the complexity of history, and far to often this is exactly what the casual movie-goer gets, which is to say, excitement and gratification.",1304985600,2,3760,4.97456279809221

3329223,4,B0012QE4PI,"The improbable Oscar winner for best foreign language film in 2007, the Austrian/German collaboration ""The Counterfeiters"" brings to light what has long been  an unknown chapter of WWII and the Holocaust. How some ingenious Jews got a chance to escape the certain death by forging foreign currency and thus boosting the Germany's economy can certainly be - and it is - a great fodder for good filmmaking. And the team under Stefan Ruzowitzky, without a doubt, more than rises to the occassion. The script is devoid of cheap tearjerking scenes and pathos found, let's say, in Steven Spielberg's approach. Still, there are enough sobering moments of hard-to-swallow cruelty, reminding the viewer of the bleakness so entrenched in the era. Overall though, the film carries a certain nonchalance - probably deliberately - as it goes the long way in describing how counterfeiters really see the world. The final impact can be that the movie comes and it goes, does not stay with you for long.

3329224,4,B0012QE4PI,"Salomon Sorowitsch (superbly played by Karl Markovics) was a thriving Jewish counterfeiter in 1930s Berlin when he was arrested and sent to a Nazi concentration camp.  While there, he was put in charge of an operation, set up by the SS, to duplicate foreign currency in an effort both to de-stabilize the Allies' economies and to continue funding the Nazi regime and its war effort.  This activity secured for him and his fellow workers numerous privileges - additional food, more humane living conditions, an increased guarantee of safety - that were denied to the other prisoners in the camp.

On the surface, ""The Counterfeiters"" provides us with a grim and disturbing look at life in a Nazi death camp.  But, like Lina Wertmuller's ""Seven Beauties,"" it goes much deeper than that, exploring the thorny ethical issue of just how far a human being should be willing to go to ensure his own survival.  As Sorowitsch himself states, in a situation such as the one in which he finds himself, ""You adapt or you perish,"" and he refuses to let the Nazis, or anyone else for that matter, make him feel guilty for doing what it takes to stay alive.  But soon there is dissension within the ranks, as Burger (August Diehl), a political idealist who believes there`s a greater cause beyond their own survival, insists the men sabotage the effort - even if that means he and all his fellow workers die as a result.  Yet, thanks to the inmates' delaying tactics, only a small number of dollars were ever produced.

Brilliantly acted and solidly directed (by Stefan Ruzowitzky), ""The Counterfeiters"" is a complex morality tale that will have you questioning your own values and examining your own conscience long after it's over.",1278028800,,1718,4.839590443686006
3329235,5,B0012QE4PI,"Superbly directed & acted, ""The Counterfeiters"" is a wholly believable recreation of the horror, mind-numbing tension and necessary survival instincts for those few who had any hope at all in a German concentration camp. The other reviews say it all but what, for me, made the film so good was the way it captured the day-to-day decisions facing these people and the incredible dichotomy they faced between self-preservation and what was ""right"". What would you do in the same situation?... You know that by printing the highest quality forged dollar notes (which your group of Jewish technicians carefully selected for ""privileged treatment"" in the camp have the skills to do) you're extending your own survival time but also the survival time for the regime that's put you in this situation but, if you don't do it, you're condemning yourself and your workmates to certain death. So, do you deliberately ensure that the plates for printing the bank notes are flawed and, as a result, accelerate the fall of the Nazi regime but in the process sign your & their death warrants... or, do you do what's required (which you know you can), and ensure that you and they have a better hope of short term and, possibly, long term survival? Do you buy precious time for you & them even though you know that by buying this time you're also perpetuating the horrors that surround you?

The brilliance of this film is in the way that explores this incredibly complex situation. Who are the heroes here? Are they those who are prepared to sacrifice their lives to prevent the Nazis achieving their goals or are they those who are prepared to risk their lives to preserve the lives of the people who surround them? Is the pursuit of self-survival acceptable in this context and in the case of the central character, a confirmed crook, morally admirable or simply an extension of his own disregard for any morals?

Deep stuff and, thankfully, a decision that none of us are likely to face. But, if we did... what would we do? ""The Counterfeiters"" asks the question and, as a result, is a supremely thought provoking film with no easy answers.",1266364800,,2128,4.779891304347826

He finds his own salvation and that of others (if not their own lives) by, first, trying to stay alive by cooperating with the enemy and, then -- growing more deeply conscious of his own humanity and that of others as well as the evil of his captors -- trying to take seemingly small actions that could not only save their lives but contribute to the larger issues of winning wars and defeating the enemies of mankind.",1258588800,3,859,4.45859872611465
3329238,5,B0012QE4PI,"The Counterfeiters is an Asutrian-German film directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky that fictionalizes Operation Bernhard, which was a secret plan by the Nazis to destabilize the United Kingdom by flooding its economy with forged currency. The film center on a Jewish counterfeiter, Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics), who is coerced into assisting the Nazis in a concentration camp. Salomon must juggle his need to stay alive by appeasing the Nazis, and to stall in the manufacturing of the fake currency. His fellow inmates range from political agitators who are reluctant to help the Nazis and others who are content to help in order to avoid the concentration camps. This creates a variety of dynamics between Nazis and inmates and between the inmates themselves. There is also a sense of guilt among these counterfeiters since they are given luxuries that other inmates in the camp do not enjoy, such as soft beds, better meals, music and a ping pong table. This comes to a head once the camp is freed by the other inmates of the camp at the war's end.

This is a gritty and suspenseful film based on the memoir written by Adolf Burger, a Jewish Slovak typographer, who was imprisoned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp and worked on Operation Berhard. The film won the Best Foreign language Film Oscar in 2008.",1258416000,,1314,4.9457013574660635

The intriguing plot, like mixing a con-game movie with a prison drama and set with unnerving moral dilemmas, grabs you from the get-go and does not relent.  All of the actors put in better-than-fine performaces.  Subtitles do not distract, quite the contrary actually.

His life changed dramatically when arrested and placed in a Nazi concentration camp. With Germany about bankrupt, the policeman that arrested him -- who is now his captor -- encourages Sorowitsch and some hand-picked specialists to trade life in the concentration camp for better living if they return to their old ways -- and produce counterfeit bank notes and foreign currency to fund the economically dying Nazi war effort.

While its antihero lead tries to maintain ethics during treachery, the film succeeds as wonderful storytelling and a projection of the macabre Nazi society where murder is state policy and each man imprisoned by it must find his way to survive and still be a man simultaneously. It is Austrian director Stefan Ruzowitzky's skill and wherewithal that helps ""The Counterfieters"" achieve this complex vision of film, art and horror.

3329244,3,B0012QE4PI,"The Bottom Line:

A disappointing film that fails to properly address the moral questions it raises and comes complete with several moments which reek of artifice (as when the counterfeiters manage to replicate the dollar just in time to save their comrades' lives), The Counterfeiters is a rather mediocre film which pales in comparison to Tim Blake Nelson's The Grey Zone.",1243209600,6,374,5.131147540983607

The events depected are very real, and  thought provoking.  The story line is very live like, but with minimal over the top violance.

3329258,4,B0012QE4PI,"It's interesting to see how in times of despair, comradry fails. A film about concentration camps with the most interesting of characters playing the lead. This film is more about counterfeiting and proposes a great reason Germany dominated the war. They counterfeited British currency to four times the actual worth and had in mind to do the same with the Dollar. What just happens then is a never heard before story of the world's history. Strongly recommended film. The Counterfeiters did something I never thought it would from the off set. Highly recommended. It's like the Pianist with not as much as emotion.",1233964800,,615,4.980582524271845
3329259,5,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is based on the true story of the largest counterfeiting effort in history.  During WWII, the German's attempted to counterfeit the British Pound and the US Dollar using Jewish concentration camp captives in a last ditch attempt to sustain their war effort.  This German film won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2007 and contains some amazing performances, especially by Karl Markovics as Solomon Sorowitsch.

As we enter the picture, Sorowitsch is living large making big sums of money as a master forger of fake documents, currency and passports in Berlin in 1936.  Ultimately, Sorowitsch doesn't escape the grip of the Nazi's and winds up in a concentration camp.  When the Nazis decide to launch Operation Bernhard, they round up Sorowitsch and other Jewish printers, ship them to another concentration camp and accelerate their counterfeiting efforts.

""The Counterfeiters"" doesn't focus on the conditions of the Holocaust to the degree other great Holocaust/WWII pictures do like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful"".  The movie does paint a sufficient and horrifying enough picture of the treatment and conditions Jewish prisoners lived through.  But the brilliance of this picture is the moral conflict that Solomon and the other prisoners face.  Their efforts enable them to prolong their lives (and suffering), one day at a time, but also raise the specter that should the effort the Nazi's enlist their help succeed, they will face the same consequences as their other family members, friends and relatives.  While we empathsize with Sorowitsch and his plight, the picture creates a more ambivalent and conflicted sense of him than I expected.  While Solomon uses his situation to bargain for other prisoners, notably one with TB, we also see a duplicitous and self-centered side.

It is when another camp prisoner, Adolf Burger, attempts to sabotage the efforts to counterfeit the dollar, that the brilliance of this film really takes shape.  What is the right choice for these traumatized and tormented individuals?  Survive even if it means helping their captors and tormentors?  Resist and undermine the counterfeiting operation while surely facing certain death sooner?  The conflict is not only with the enemy, but is also within the ranks of these prisoners, simmering below the surface until it finally reaches its boiling point.

""The Counterfeiters"" is a tremendous piece of film-making.  It is emotionally wrenching and morally thought provoking -- a great piece of art that will linger with you for a long time after watching it.",1232236800,5,2581,5.2689486552567235
3329260,5,B0012QE4PI,"I am not going to praise the acting, cinematography, direction and everything else about this movie that is really super - the movie got an Academy Award. What I do wish to say is that coming up with the idea to make a movie on the Nazis and the counterfeiting exercise is brilliant and original. I think most other aspects of World War II have been repeated over and over again in too many different ways (The excellent HBO series ""Band of Brothers"" did come to mind).

The other point I wish to make (and which the movie illustrates so well), is that it is very important to be really good at something and to build a reputation on that ability. This fact is true in everyday life and also in the case of Salomon (Sally) from the movie.

I liked the way Sally's compassion for fellow prisoners and also the strong feeling of self preservation is depicted throughout the movie.",1229990400,,878,4.447204968944099
3329261,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" tells the story of concentration camp prisoners working for the Nazis during World War II.  The prisoners, all Jewish, make up phony passports and identification papers for spies and other criminals and then graduate into producing counterfeit currencies.  They start with the British pound paper and then go on to the U. S. dollar.  They were especially successful with the pound notes they produce revealing the little known story of how this could have brought the British economy to its knees at the end of the war.

The counterfeiting prisoners live in relatively luxurious conditions at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp while others at the same camp are left to starve and live in filth.  At the shocking end, the deprived prisoners confront their well fed colleagues and we expect a blood bath to ensue.  Instead, peace is made and most of our heroes survive.

""Making of"" features provide useful additional information which tell us that the Bank of England had to suspend printing some of its standard currency for a time after the war since over 130 million pounds of counterfeits were in circulation thanks to the Nazis.  The counterfeits were so well made that only top experts could tell them from the real thing; also, that some are even being recovered today from a lake in Switzerland where they were dumped after the war ended.

There are also extended interviews with the producer/director/writer, key stars, and the man on whom so much of the story is based, Adolph Burger.  These add quite a bit to understanding the real-life basis of the show and demonstrate the indomitable courage of Mr. Burger in telling his story.  It is an important one.

Although this movie is generally well done and holds your interest the whole way one wonders why some of the gratuitous violence and sex were left in while some worthy scenes were dropped.  The latter show connections between the characters and were not that long.  This is while scenes were left in like the murderous SS seargent urinating on the head of the lead character while he was cleaning up the latrine.  Another gross scene occurs when this same SS seargent kills the young Russian inmate who had contracted tuberculosis.  The seargent tells the other prisoners he was protecting them from infection but they and we are unconvinced.

Moreover, we didn't see much justice done at the end.  We kept waiting for the same SS seargent or the camp commandant to get their final desserts but that never happened.  If the producer/director/writer wanted to show the futility and meaninglessness of if all, you'd have to say he succeeded.  While acting and production values are of the first order we were left without a positive closing to the story.  Yes, it was educational and we could see why it would win awards but it could have been better with a little more thought.  Since Mr. Burger was brought in as a key advisor on the project you'd think he would have insisted on positive footnotes.  The Allies did win the war and their economies didn't collapse.  Finally, many top Nazis were brought to justice for the crimes, not only at Nuremberg, but elsewhere in Germany and Europe.  It wouldn't have taken much more to make these points and leave the audience with a feeling that some justice had been done.",1229731200,,3307,4.85204991087344
3329262,4,B0012QE4PI,"For Sally (or Salomon), a Russian jew, business was good in 1932 Germany.  While Nazism was on the rise, that only meant there was a growing need for false papers -- and he was the reputed ""king of the counterfeiters.""  He had no interest in politics, and thought he could avoid suspicion by being clever.  It turned out he was wrong.  He is captured and finds that his skill as an artist and ultimately his abilities as a counterfeiter make him valuable, but only as long as he is able to convince his fellow prisoners to  help him deliver the goods.

This is a strong film, quite gripping from start to finish.  I don't think it breaks any genuinely new ground, and it doesn't feel completely unique.  But it is a strong story, well worth telling.  The cinematography is unique, combining mostly low-key lighting with a range of tones, and making sparing but consistent use of handheld camera movements throughout, adding both a sense of realism and a feeling of invasiveness.  The use of music in the early scenes avoids sentimentality -- it is intended to evoke an era and give a sense of character rather than to create an artificial feeling of sympathy.

What makes the film work is that Sally and his fellow inmates are not presented as saints or heroes or even victims.  They are resourceful individuals in a terrible situation, and they make the best of it -- but the moral questions that face them are not clear: on the one hand, by carrying out the work the Nazis have asked of them they are saving their own lives, but on the other hand they are supporting the war.  The film does not judge whether they do wrong to continue living.  As Sally says (roughly) ""I won't allow the Nazis to make me feel ashamed for wanting to live.""

The story of the Nazis forcing concentration camp inmates to forge foreign currency to bankrupt England was compelling. The 'dilemma' the characters face of doing good work and enjoying more comfortable survival, or sabbotaging their captors efforts, drives the film.

3329264,3,B0012QE4PI,"The story is interesting and the presentation is fine, but for two things that it is worth only 3 stars to me:
1. too much grainy effect on the video quality that it seems only marginal improvement over DVD ver, which I happened to have bought earlier, and the comparison of two tells no big difference.  It is said to be the director's intent to make it look like old style movie, but too much would ruin what made us buy the BR version instead of the DVD.  The DVD version in 480p is truely what the director desired for heavy grainy look!

2. too much hand shaking effect to the camera in many occasions.  The director seems to produce the effect that there was a camerman running with the actors and shotting at the spot.  But again, too much of anything would kill the good intent.  It just gets me headache to watch.

Anyway, still a good film produced by foreign producer other than Hollywood esp based on WWII true stories.",1227657600,3,931,4.377906976744186

It takes a little to get into the flow of the movie and feel comfortable with who the characters are. The end of the movie is a bit abrupt also. You aren't quite sure what happened to some of the main characters between the last days of the war and the ending where the main character is in a Casino in Monaco. In spite of these drawbacks, this is an interesting movie that makes you want to go out and learn more about the events it was based on.",1226102400,,589,4.130434782608695
3329275,3,B0012QE4PI,"The German-Austrian film The Counterfeiters is based on a remarkable true story. Late in World War Two the Nazis rounded up Jews who had been confined in various concentration camps and set up a large counterfeiting operation designed to undermine the British and U.S. economies. The Nazis found some 150 Jews with the necessary skills and put them together in a special section within the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, providing the latest money-making equipment, giving them plenty of food and comfortable accommodations. But the counterfeiters were constantly pressured to produce (at pain of death) and there were sadistic S.S. guards who cruelly reminded the counterfeiters that they were still in Hell.

Just outside the counterfeiters' quarters other prisoners were brutalized by the Nazis. In one incident, a group of the counterfeiters can hear a guard insulting a man as he executes him. The bullets fly through the very wooden wall next to which they are standing.

It's an important and compelling story. But much of the film was shot with a hand-held that often awkwardly jumps from actor to actor in prolonged scenes. In one of the DVD special features writer-director Stefan Ruzowitzky asserted that he was trying to create a documentary effect. I think he failed at this. It all comes off as too contrived.

The main character is Saloman ""Sally"" Sorowitsch, portrayed very energetically by Karl Markovics. Sally is a very clever, tough, wily man who jerkily moves about like a bantam rooster surrounded by mean foxes. His eyes dart from tormentor to tormentor. Too much eye-darting, if such a thing is possible. Markovics likes to strike a pose, as do the other key players, both victims and tormentors. They are quite good at striking poses, but enough is enough.

I recommend the audio commentary by Ruzowitzky. He addresses some of the things I wondered about, like the sometimes bizarre soundtrack. The interview given by Adolf Burger is very touching. Now in his nineties, he is a survivor of the counterfeiters. Burger was a consultant on the film. He has devoted decades of his life to keeping the memory of the Holocaust and the counterfeiting operation alive.

Although this film received the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, I would not rate it so highly. It just did not seem ""genuine,"" somewhat like a good counterfeit.",1224979200,6,2369,5.079691516709511
3329276,5,B0012QE4PI,"Until watching this movie, I had no idea that the largest counterfeiting operation of all time was carried out by prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp.  They were assigned to forge pounds and dollars, in order to undermine the Allied economy and finance the Nazi war effort.  They ended up printing over 100 million pounds sterling, which even the Bank of England could not distinguish from the genuine article.  On the other hand, as a result of stalling tactics, they didn't crack the dollar until the war was almost over and it no longer made any difference.

This movie is a fictionalized version of this story.  Prisoners with relevant skills are brought in to a special, top-secret area in a concentration camp, where in contrast to the appalling conditions elsewhere, they are provided with sufficient food, decent beds, time for breaks, etc.  But if they don't produce results, they will be shot.  Sorowich, a master counterfeiter, is brought in to take charge of the counterfeiting operation.  Burger, one of the other workers on the operation, wants to sabotage the operation, so as to hamper the Nazi war effort.  This view is not popular among the other workers, who do not feel like dying for this cause, just so that other workers can be brought in to do the job for them.  Much of the movie is a dramatization of this moral argument.  The end result is to delay the production of the dollar just enough.  The protagonist is Sorowich, who initially just wants to save his skin, and also has a personal longing to crack the dollar, but eventually sort of comes around to the other point of view.

The movie is very well done.  The acting is excellent, especially the actors who play Sorowich, and Herzog, the boss of the concentration camp.  One is really immersed in the concentration camp, which is quite scary, although not nearly as gruesome as it could be since we are in the elite section.

The bonus features are worth watching and tell more about the true story on which the movie is based.  For example, in reality, only two people knew about the sabotage, unlike in the movie where for dramatic purposes lots of people knew about it so that they could argue about it on screen.",1224547200,,2202,4.692708333333333

How this is accomplished and why it ultimately fails is carried out in detail in this film.

The film is in German, with fairly large English sub-titles. Among the extras is a queston-and-answer period with the director, who speaks near-perfect English. There are few other extras.

The real, historic story about the counterfeiters is interesting, but the film doesn't do it justice. I only watched it to the bitter end, because I tried to understand why this movie got so much praise in the German press. I still don't understand. There are much better Holocaust movies. This is more like an action film that happens to play between 1933 and 1945. It has no subtlety, the characters are not developed, it feels like a manga version.",1222992000,12,740,4.834645669291339
3329283,5,B0012QE4PI,"Instead of making another depressing Holocaust film, writer/director Stefan Rozuwitzky chose to create an ensemble drama to examine the strength of conscience vs staying alive. Some names were changed, and a few facts, too, but the resulting film is devastating in its narrative. The central character, ""Sally"" Sorowitch (the amazing Karl Markovics) is the main character, thrown into various concentration camps, until he arrives at Sachsenhausen, where he's treated better than elsewhere. He's a master counterfeiter who is expected to help the Nazi's get money to both finance their further war effort, and destroy the economies of Britain & the US. There isn't much more to say without blabbing away plot stuff, but the screenplay is based on fellow inmate/forger Adolf Burger's memoir (played with profound sincerity by August Diehl). Burger, actually, was ready to go along with the Nazi demands, but here he's played as the conscience of the whole film.  The central character of ""Sally"" was actually based on a man named Smolianoff (but he didn't emerge famous and ended up forging passports for Jews who wanted to go to Palestine). David Striesow should be commended for his smarmy performance as Commandant Herzog. It's hard to say more here, but I recommend this film highly, for an inside perspective. The DVD extras are super-plentiful, and director Rozuwitsky explains that many things needed to be changed for legal reasons; he also wanted to present a German film about conscience (regarding the Holocaust).

3329296,5,B0012QE4PI,"There are hundreds of movies about the Holocaust and most of them detail the unbelievable horrors of totalitarianism and racism.  What makes this film stand apart is that it gives us a story of morally complex individuals who don't have the luxury of making easy choices between good and evil.

Imagine, if you will, being given a chance at life, even a tolerably good life, in the bowels of Hell. But in order to live, you have to betray all those fighting to end that evil, brutal world.  A few select men in the Sachsenhausen camp are given that choice...and (according to the film) they choose to live, even if some will become morally bankrupt in doing so. The most interesting personality of course, is the main protoganist - the best counterfeiter in Germany - who is a Jew (yes) but also a criminal type. According to his code of honor, which he translates into the concentration camp, a person may fake millions of bank notes to help the German regime continue to oppress, but one cannot squeal or compromise another prisoner - whatever the reason.  The counterfeiter  even secretly relishes the idea of accomplishing the impossible...heading the most daring money forgery operation in human history.  Opposing him is a Russian idealist who believes that he must, absolutely must, sabotage the operation in order to bring the Nazi regime down.  I was absolutely thrilled by Karl Marcovich's performance - subtle, nuanced, ruthless, and at times heart-breakingly compassionate.

3329298,4,B0012QE4PI,"I purchased this movie because a friend of mine is the son of a master engraver who created the forged British banknotes during WWII.  When I saw the movie I was quite surprised with its involvement with the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.  The engraver that I knew about was a German civilian.  Nevertheless, the DVD contains an interview with the Russian engraver who was the main character in this verson of the story of this counterfeiting operation.  It is my conjecture that the task of the German Government in this project was too important to their economy to perform the forgery in only one location or facility.  This movie portrays a most unusual take on life in a German concentration camp, Sachsenhausen. The creation of an elite group of master engravers to carry out this operation was totally exceptional to expected camp life.  Instead of fear of the guards, poor food or starvation, and bad quarters, these prisoners were given good civilian clothes probably taken from others who were less fortunate.  They slept on beds with cotton sheets, and ate high quality food.  They had classical music played on the phonograph while they worked at their printing tasks.  While the story was a good story dealing with the tensions between prisoners from differing ethnic, social, and political backgrounds (The villian was a communist who tried to sabotage operations).  This makes a good plot for a movie, but from another friend of mine who had been in the Dachau Camp, the prisoners were sorted into four categories; common criminals, political prisoners (my friend), prisoners who were candidates for ethnic cleansing, and finally the insane, crippled, or medically defective individuals.  They wore a distinctive uniform peculiar to each category, and probably did not mix very much socially.  The Russian engraver fitted the criminal category well and had been arrested for forging passports and travel papers. The movie had minor technical problems.  The printing equipment used was not of sufficient quality to print bank notes. A scene of the prisoners dancing in celebration used dance movements appropriate to the 1960's.  Nevertheless, the movie portrayed a very believeable story of a technical secret operation of the German Government that is closely held even today.

3329299,4,B0012QE4PI,the movie focuses on a true piece of nazi's and jewish history during the second WW.  The acting was excellent that portrayed a group of men who became part of the nazi's funding plan by forging the english pounds and other documents like passports.  Although the story is based in the concentration camp and in places the story took some gruelsome turns; it was another sad protrayal of human behavior and yet the human spirit to come through all of it.  A truely remarkable movie.,1220054400,,482,4.647058823529412
3329300,4,B0012QE4PI,"""The Counterfeiters"" is a dramatization one of the largest counterfeiting operations in history, a top secret Nazi initiative called ""Operation Bernhardt"" that operated out of Blocks 18 and 19 of the Sachenhaussen concentration camp using prisoners with expertise in forgery and printing to counterfeit over 132 million during World War II. The film is based on the book ""The Devil's Workshop"" by Adolf Burger, who consulted on director Stefan Ruzowitzky's screenplay. Burger was a political prisoner from Prague, a printer by profession, who was among the prisoners in the counterfeiting program at Sachenhaussen. The story in the film is heavily fictionalized to make it more of a morality play than a history lesson, and most names have been changed for legal reasons. But the story of the operation and sabotage are true.

Salomon ""Sally"" Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics) is living the high life in Berlin of the 1930s, financed by the money he makes forging documents, which are much in demand as war looms. He's arrested by an officer of the Berlin counterfeiting squad and sent to prison but later transferred to a concentration camp, because he is Jewish. Another transfer to Sachenhaussen allows Sally to escape those dreadful conditions. There, he is introduced to a diverse group of prisoners who have been given the task of counterfeiting the British pound and American dollar by none other than his arresting officer, now Sturmbannfuhrer Herzog (Devid Striesow). Sally is grateful for the relatively comfortable living conditions and amenable to the challenge of his work, but another prisoner, Adolf Burger (August Diehl), feels that they should sabotage the Nazi counterfeiting effort.

Liberties taken with the real story may account for ""The Counterfeiters"" poor reception in Germany and Austria. The rest of the world seemed more willing to focus on the fascinating counterfeiting operation and (fictional) moral quandary of the prisoners. There is a lot to like in Ruzowitzky's script. Instead of the usual innocent bourgeois perspective on life inside a concentration camp, Sally is a career criminal, accustomed to being in prison. Instead of conflict between Nazis and prisoners, the conflict is within the prisoners themselves: Should we help the Nazi war effort to save our lives? ""The Counterfeiters"" offers the perspective of prisoners who, briefly, had a relatively cushy situation but feared a return to their previous nightmare. Sally's survival instinct and his convict's commitment to never rat out a fellow inmate come into conflict at Sachenhaussen, which makes a good story. In German with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Sony 2008): Bonus features are in English or in German with subtitles, as noted. ""The Making of The Counterfeiters"" (10 min, German)  interviews director Ruzowitzky, Adolf Burger, and the cast, with some discussion of the real events. ""Interviews"" are with Stefan Ruzowitzky (18 min, English), Adolf Burger (10 min, German), and actor Karl Markovics (10 min, English). In ""Adolf Burger's Artifacts"" (19 min, German), Burger talks about the counterfeiting, sabotage, life in the camp, the real Sally, and shows us some mementos. ""Q&A with director Stefan Ruzowitzky (13 min, English) takes questions from the audience at AFI Filmfest. There is a good, constant feature commentary by Stefan Ruzowitzky that discusses photography, editing, filming, fictional elements, and more. And there is a theatrical trailer and 4 deleted scenes. To hear the true story of Operation Bernhardt, the best feature is ""Adolf Burger's Artifacts"". For the director's explanation of his intentions, watch the 18-minute interview. Subtitles are available for the film in English, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French.",1218844800,,3759,5.420512820512821
3329301,4,B0012QE4PI,"There were seldom easy choices during The Holocaust.  Survival meant everything, and those who did live past World War II had fascinating and harrowing stories to share.  Such is the case of ladies' man and counterfeiter, Solomon Sarowitsch (Kal Makovics).

When an S.S. agent catches ""Sally`s"" fake U.S. dollars, he puts him in a concentration camp.  Savvy and a gifted artist, he creates a flattering pencil portrait of an SS figure head.  From there he gets a ticket to more bearable living conditions, including soft bunk-beds and livable food rations.  He does more portraits, including an outside mural until an officer announces his deportation to another camp.  Easily perturbed by the change in plans, he discovers the Nazis have bigger fish for him to fry.

At the new concentration camp, he encounters Holst (Martin Brambach), the officer who arrested him.  The new camp still provides livable conditions including operatic music during work, but his new assignment is to create the most authentic counterfeit currency from the allies' side, making pounds and later dollars.

Always desperate and under pressure, Sally's collected spirit is at odds with communist co-worker, Burger (August Diehl), who insists they ""sabotage"" the operation, noting that replenished funds could help the Nazis win the war.  No easy dilemma, dissention hits within the group as Sally tries to keep informants from squealing while keeping a young lascivious friend from being detected for his infectious tuberculosis.  Pressured by Herzog (Devid Stricson), a less menacing SS officer and a key bargaining chip, Sally must decide if he must do what is practical to survive or bend to Burger who sees his plan as the only way to help all.

While the presentation of 'The Counterfeiters' is easily more tightly presented and creates more tangible Nazi tension than '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Book/dp/B000TGCR38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Book</a>,' it's hard to say this Holocaust film has the same impact as some finer ones like `<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Au-Revoir-Les-Enfants/dp/630121613X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Au Revoir Les Enfants</a>'.

Best of all, 'The Counterfeiters' provides a great story and tells it well.

(An Oscar nominee for ""Best Foreign film, 'The Counterfeiters' was directed with laudable finesse by Stefan Ruzowitzky.)

3329302,5,B0012QE4PI,"Operation Bernhard was a secret Nazi counterfeit scheme and one of the lesser-known events of WWII.  A group of Jewish printers, engravers, graphic artists, and commercial photographers were rounded up and taken to Sachsenhausen where a counterfeiting factory was set up specifically to produce English Pound notes and later, US dollars, with the Nazi goal of flooding and destabilizing Britain's economy.  The resulting notes were so expertly manufactured that Nazi spies had them validated by the Bank of England, which confirmed them as authentic.  ""The Counterfeiters"" (Die Flscher) is based on this true story.

The film opens in Monte Carlo after WWII.  Salomon Sorowitsch (Sally) has a case filled with bank notes, which he carelessly spends at a posh hotel.  The story flashes back to 1936 Berlin when Sally was a master forgerer and artist with a thriving underground business.  He is captured by the Nazi police and taken to a hard labor camp where he cheats death by drawing portraits of SS officers.  Five years later, he is moved to a concentration camp, Sachsenhausen, where he is ordered to supervise the production of what amounted to 132M in counterfeit notes.

Sally is a realist and much as he is sickened by the Nazi's atrocities, he works hard at perfecting their product for no other purpose than self-preservation.  ""One adapts or dies,"" he says.  The group is housed separately from other prisoners and is given sheets, soap, and clothing. Their participation, however, did not guarantee them their lives.  To fully grasp the hopelessness, author Lawrence Malkin wrote in his book, ""Krueger's Men,"" an account of this same story:  ""[The SS planned to keep the operation secret by killing them when the job was done. The prisoners worked with the knowledge that they were marked for death when they had finished their jobs.]  From the start, they wondered whether they should stretch out their work and risk execution for sabotage, or perform efficiently and thus hasten their own deaths.""

The cries and shots from beyond their barracks can be distinctly heard and the group still suffers occasional beatings and humiliations by the SS.  A young idealist and printer, Adolf Burger, whose wife was killed in Auschwitz, incites the group to sabotage the counterfeiting operations, arguing that they are party to the financing of the Nazi war effort.  Sally manages to abort Burger's plans, insisting that dying for a principle is worthless.  Despite being a swindler, Sally protected his mates as best as he could and refused to betray anyone of them, going so far as to barter with his barracks commandant for medicine for a sick mate and lying to save another's life.

This story survived because Adolf Burger survived.  He is 90 years old and still lectures about the Holocaust and Operation Bernhard in Prague, and served as consultant in the film.  It does have an incredible level of authenticity to it.  Karl Markovics as Sally was just superb.  With very little outward emotion, he is able to project the nightmarish life in Sachsenhausen, where one mistake could mean the end of your life.  He is clearly torn by his need to survive and the tragedies of his mates--Burger's wife and another's children killed by the Nazis--as well as the killings of prisoners beyond their barracks.  His moments of grief are quite touching.  The young August Diehl as Burger is excellent, too, and his idealistic stance was an effective contrast to Sally's pragmatism.  Two very different men with divergent approaches, but both courageous and inspiring.  When the story returns to Monte Carlo, Sally does something unexpected that's a fitting end to the story.

I really think it's a perfect film.  There's not a single thing I can find fault with.  It's a quality drama about the moral dilemmas prisoners grappled with when faced daily with the prospect of death, and how wrenching these choices were.  It certainly deserved its Oscar as best Foreign Language Film in 2007.

DVD extras are: The Making of..., Interview with the director, Adolf Burger's Artifacts, and a Q&A with the director, all worth seeing as they provide an even deeper understanding of the true story of Operation Bernhard (named after the scheme's instigator, SS officer Bernhard Krueger).  It's an excellent and compelling story and highly recommended.

3329303,5,B0012QE4PI,"Before World War II broke out, the Russian-born Jew Salomon Sorowitsch earned a well-deserved reputation as ""the most charming scoundrel in Berlin."" The Nazis arrested him as ""the world's best counterfeiter"" and sent him to Sachsenhausen where they forced him to forge identification cards, passports, documents, bank notes, and money. Lots of money, as in millions of pounds that the Nazis flooded into the British economy to destabilize its currency. The film focuses on Sorowitsch's role, but includes the many other Jews in the concentration camp whose skills as engravers, printers, and graphic artists landed them in a life of relative luxury that included clean beds, food, medicine, opera music and even a ping pong table. Avoiding extermination was one thing; betraying fellow Jews and, in effect, financing the Nazi war effort was another. All sorts of moral complexities plague these inmates, none more so than when one of their own sabotages their counterfeiting work on the American dollar. This film is based upon a memoir by Adolph Burger that describes his role in the operation. The Counterfeiters won an Academy Award in 2007 for Best Foreign Language Film.
