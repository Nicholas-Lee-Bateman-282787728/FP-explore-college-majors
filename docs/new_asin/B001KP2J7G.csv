It seems there were problems on at least one disc per season but it wasn't enough to make me ship the whole set back just to find out there may be another disc here or there with similar issues. I don't know if this is from the manufacturing or what, but I bought this set new and like I said, I'm just glad to have it. I hope to buy the last three seasons as gift to myself later on.",1283040000,,517,3.7962962962962963
