3781871,2,B001RXB4Q8,"Being a connoisseur of all things ""rave"", I could not wait to see another attempt at another video portrayal of Ecstasy Culture. Not that I expected much really. I have been constantly disappointed by these types of releases before. So far the only movie of this genre that has satisfied has been Human Traffic. This one and all others fall short.
The problem with this one is that there is no character development. After 40 minutes, you still don't have any interest in them or what happens to them. The movie only gives you a glimpse into their lives for a moment and then you see them partying. Nothing else. Also, the foreshadowing is a bit much here. It isn't too hard to determine what is going to happen next in the film. If you have the money to spend and you HAVE to see it, then go ahead, but be warned that if you have seen any other crappy rave movie, then you have already seen this one.",1291939200,,901,4.337278106508876

""Rolling"" is a low-budget independent film focused on a handful of young Angelenos who have all had experience with the drug Ecstasy.  Done in the style of a you-are-there docudrama, the movie alternates between traditional dramatic sequences and staged interviews with the characters who speak directly to the camera about the drug and the effect it's had on their lives.  (The term ""rolling"" refers to the high one gets when tripping on the drug).

The movie certainly means well, and there are definitely some lessons to be learned from the characters' experiences.  And, in all fairness, director/co-writer Billy Samoa Saleebey doesn't engage in quite as much melodramatic finger-wagging as the material might have warranted.  But the amateurishness of the execution - the jittery, handheld camera, the time-lapse psychedelics, the unconvincing performances, the lackluster writing - robs the movie of much of its impact.  Somehow, when all the characters do is party and talk about partying, there isn't much room for them to grow and develop into compelling and engaging figures.  As a result, we become detached observers rather than fully engaged participants in the scene - and that, given the urgency of the subject matter, is simply unacceptable.",1273622400,2,1264,5.316582914572864
3781873,5,B001RXB4Q8,I loved this movie!! It was a very accurate potrayal of the use and feeling of ecstasy. The unknown actors in this film did a fabulous job in their roles. If one didn't know any better one would think they actually did take ecstasy while shooting each scene. Defenitely the best rave movie I've ever seen!!,1244419200,3,306,4.482142857142857
3781874,5,B001RXB4Q8,"The film Rolling is a look into a social scene that few have experienced; the Rave and Ecstacy scene in Los Angeles. In a docu-drama format, this films follows the lives of six young people who have relatively normal day-lives, and nights and weekends live the Rave and Ectasy life. The unknown actors do an excellent job of taking us into this lifestyle and are totally believable in their roles. The music and camera work add to the authenticity of this remarkable film. Absolutely outstanding!",1244332800,2,496,4.847058823529411
8339171,3,B001RXB4Q8,"This is basically a documentary following several people who spent a great deal of time taking MDMA or Ecstasy. I was expecting a better mix of music to enhance the messages of each person partying. There was plenty of bad acting in it and had a lower budget quality to the actual formatting of the movie. In all, watched once and will pass it along. Not worth a second watch,",1497916800,,376,4.385714285714286
8339172,3,B001RXB4Q8,Fairly entertaining with a little bit of anti drug propaganda,1465862400,,61,5.2
8339173,3,B001RXB4Q8,kinda boring really,1457222400,,19,5.666666666666667
8339174,2,B001RXB4Q8,"I have to say that I wasn't sure what this movie was going to be and apparently neither did the writer, producers or the director. I had absolutely no feeling for any of these people. I had no empathy either....willingly getting into the drug Escstasy?  No sympathy and therefore the movie was not worth my time. skip it....big time.",1405036800,,333,4.6440677966101696
8339175,3,B001RXB4Q8,"This actually turned out a lot better than I thought it was. I had actually quit watching, got mad at the movie and gave it away to a friend. My friend and I had an argument and he gave it back, and I thought ""Figures. He knows I hated that movie."" So it sat on my shelve collecting dust until just a week ago when I got so bored for something to watch I took it out and played it again. This time I watched the whole movie. It starts out like an annoying documentary with the actors giving commentary on their experiences with using Ecstacy My first thought was, ""Who the ^*&^ cares?"" And then when this commentary carried on halfway through the movie, ""What the %$(^?"" But I was so bored that I was willing to sit through even this and I must admit, people are right when they say ""Good things come to those who wait."" Or at least it was right this time. It has a really slow build up but if you too can be patient, you will not regret it.",1386806400,,941,4.064516129032258
8339176,5,B001RXB4Q8,Funny movie but they had to ruin it with s sappy ending.  It would have been better just to stick with original story.,1368662400,,118,4.130434782608695
8339177,3,B001RXB4Q8,"I liked the movie, not that it was anything to write home about.  However the movie when arrived was partially crushed.  May be the transports fault, but we all can't be Jason Statham.",1363046400,,184,4.545454545454546

8339179,3,B001RXB4Q8,This movie is ok for the topic. I kind of lost interest so I don't really remember the ending of this movie.,1355011200,,108,3.9545454545454546
8339180,4,B001RXB4Q8,"at first while watching the beginning it seems like its a documentary and you're sort of waiting for the movie to actually start, id say the first hr or so is ALL INTERVIEWS OF people & their experiences of doing ectasy & its incredibly boring & ur thinking... WTF??? did i just spend actual money on this???!! But then when they all go to the rave the movie starts to come alive and becomes interesting, there's great music and the characters make u laugh, there's definitely drama in the end but overall its not too bad, the rave part is really good. But i wouldnt spend more than $10 on this",1315526400,,594,4.36036036036036
