8658123,5,B00KEL1QOO,"BEWARE OF THE BLOB! And contrary to that unfriendly-looking 'Mature Content' label you see on the box, this set of two movies does not contain any mature content. The most it has anywhere close to that is (and these-except for the ones regarding the creature- are all from Son Of Blob): A man who was in the bathtub breaking a window in his house after The Blob started to come under a closed door and attempt to get him- and then you see that he has escaped through said window and is running away down the street- without clothing on- however it only shows his upper body so this really is not a problem; The Blob eating various beings (SPOILER! They have it eat a Kitten near the beginning- Rotten Writers...); some PG statements at various parts of the film and maybe some smoking; and perhaps a particular rude word here or there (although I really didn't catch any other than possibly a character remarking about The Blob at the near end. So really there is a lack of mature content in both of these films, and again all of the content mentioned except for The Blob eating various characters is from Son Of Blob. If a combined rating needed to be given for both of these movies, I would say PG. So now we've finished the content rating part of this. On to actually reviewing the two movies.

The Blob is a good, cheesy, somewhat-comedic horror film that scores a major rating of Five Stars. A meteor from space carrying The Blob creature falls and smashes down nearby the house of old Farmer. And a Dog. There is a Dog there too. Naturally he (the old Farmer) goes to investigate. Seeing the crashed meteorite on the ground, he does what the average sensible (if that seems sensible to you) person does and pokes it with a stick. It opens and The Blob creature falls out, and he pokes the creature, it sticks to the stick, climbs up and gets on his hand- and does not come off. He runs off like this, meets the two main characters, they take him to the Doctor, it escapes and eats various beings, etc etc. Good acting throughout all of this. Not much of a scary-like film, but tis good regardless of that small thing. And the Five Stars for this movie holds up the entire review with Five Stars, never mind what Son Of Blob rates. So on to that now.

Son Of Blob looks like a cheap, not very well thought-out film, but it still is held up to Five Stars by the previous movie (otherwise it would have Three Stars). Frankly this movie is somewhat stupid. From the box content warning I was concerned that it would indeed contain mature content, but seeing it I can assure you: This does not contain Mature Content, only Stupid Content. A lot of this movie simply contains The Blob coming and eating various beings. It starts with a fellow bringing back some suspicious-looking red-ice back from a certain place mentioned and shown at the end of the first movie. Of course it has The Blob in it, and of course it melts. It eats everybeing living in the house, and then escapes. Various several scenes involving it eating various characters and then it has the ending finale...And then - A possible ending? Or a cliff-hanger? SPOILERS! You'll have to find out for yourself, when you buy THE BLOB And SON OF BLOB!",1532131200,,3214,4.455008488964347

8658128,5,B00KEL1QOO,"Apparently there are now three different versions of The Blob being sold at Amazon. This beautiful, near flawless print is amazing to behold. With video and audio quality equal to or even superior to the original theater presentation, Umbrella Entertainment, out of Australia, is a company to watch for, both literally and figuratively. The other two versions are the one from Criterion, the most expensive of the three, and some other nameless company that, according to its reviews, is a pan and scan, inferior product not much better than a VHS bootleg copy. The DVD here, by Umbrella, is likely as good as Criterion's DVD, but without the extras -- that they make you pay a premium for. If what you're looking for is high quality, without all the whistles and bells, then this version does not disappoint. The secondary film, Beware the Blob, aka Son of Blob, is director Larry Hagman's silly, nonsensical and non-widescreen travesty whose only claim to fame is an occasional chuckle, if that much. For true connoisseurs of the genre, however, the Criterion Blu-ray is likely unparalleled.",1514419200,4,1093,5.010989010989011

8658131,5,B00KEL1QOO,"Glad I found this reasonably priced, TWO movie version, rather than buying the higher priced Criterion dvd.  I just wanted to see ""The Blob"" again, and not have to fork over the big bucks for it.  The image and sound of the film is just fine.  Clear with no cuts nor sound problems.  Very satisfied.  Got it quick, too!",1479168000,5,319,4.338983050847458
