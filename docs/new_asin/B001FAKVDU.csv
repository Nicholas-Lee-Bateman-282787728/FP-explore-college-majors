8301463,2,B001FAKVDU,"I bought this to introduce children to the Our Gang and Laurel & Hardy -- in this regard except for the Our Gang (Little Rascals) it fails.  This DVD is designed to mis-lead buyers.

The Our Gang films are fine.  The ""Laurel & Hardy"" implies you will see them both in their personas; but almost all the work is pre- their partnership, one in which Stan merely directs and one in which I could see no connection to L&H whatsoever.  That said, it does contain there last film -- Atoll K / Utopia (1951)
