6890714,5,B00QYZJCPE,"As a long-time devotee of August Wilson's work, I agree with many other critics and theater historians (like me) that place Wilson in the ranks of O'Neill, Albee, Miller, Williams and Foote...one of our greats whose work will endure and enrich the American theater forever.  This is a superb documentary on Wilson's life and work.  If you teach high school or university students, this is a fine introduction.  I am depressed that only ONE film of a Wilson play has been made: ""The Piano Lesson.""  We should all beg Oprah Winfrey's production company to correct this injustice!",1427328000,5,577,4.917525773195877
