Sparks will fly in this laugh out loud comedy for the ages.

The movie is about Ben (John Ritter) and his son Junior (Michael Oliver) who is moving from Cold River to Mortville in search of a new life, and when they arrive Mortville, the singles are waiting for him and they even have a barbeque at the neighbor's house for which the barbeque blows up right into his face, then Junior goes to school and the principal (you'll never guess who it is!) skips Junior from the 3rd grade to the 6th grade cause the principal tells Junior that he's a genious.
Then Junior makes a new 'friend' or is it bully.
Later on in the movie Ben has a crush on the school nurse Annie (Amy Yasbeck who played the annoying mother on the first movie)
and Big Ben (Jack Warden) moves in with them, and Junior later meets the nurse's bratty daughter named Trixxie, there's a hilarious scene at the carnival when Junior couldn't go on the crazy dance cause he was a little too short and he sabotages the ride which everybody vomits and back at home Ben meets a mean rich woman named Lawanda who detests Junior and later on they're about to get married which Junior will do anything to sabotage the marriage but then again Ben has a crush on the school nurse and Trixxie and Junior became friends and Ben decides that he doesn't want to marry Lawanda cause he wanted Annie more.
If you liked the first Problem Child movie, you'll like this movie even more cause it's funnier and not as annoying as the first and the scenery was much prettier and there's actually a made for TV movie called Problem Child 3 and stay away from that pile of crud, it is such an awful movie, the only character that returns is Jack Warden as Big Ben.",1049155200,6,1977,4.274666666666667
440002,1,630223218X,"""Problem Child 2"" is also one of the worst sequels of all time. Thank God John Ritter's almost disappeared from the movies, since he himself was probably tramatized by being in this junk. Michael Oliver as Junior Healy is one of the most repellent kids I've ever seen in the movies, but that was pretty much intentional for his character. However, the little girl in this movie, Trixie, is much, much worse. This is the only little girl I've seen in a movie that I wish had died a horrible, painful death! Both the ""Problem Child"" and ""Home Alone"" series are so-called children's comedies that never should have spawned endless sequels and clones, or even be released to the public, for that matter. They're crass, exploitative cinema designed for children who are ""BAD TO THE BONE.""",1047600000,5,783,4.764705882352941

In this sequel, Junior and his dad Ben(John Ritter) move to a new city to start a new life but with Junior's wild antics, you know thats not going to happen. This movie is filled with many great scenes I hope they make a DVD out of this filled with great features. This series is totally messed up by Problem Child 3: Junior in Love. It is a horrible movie, there's another actor portraying junior and he is horrible as well. So check out Problem Child 2!!

::::HERE IS A SHORT MORE IN-DEPTH SYNOPSIS I WROTE::::

In this sequel, Junior's back in his first adventure since his last! Junior and Ben move to Mortville which seems like the perfect town to live in. The Healys have a nice new house--and Junior get's a cool new room! And young women have formed a line at Ben's door in order to get a piece of him (romantically). Ben does feel he should get remarried so Junior can have a mom, so while Junior adjusts to his new school which includes a little girl who's as bratty as Junior and a teenage brain-dead ignoramous bully in Junior's sixth grade class, Ben finds some dates, which Junior sends running for the hills, in the meantime Junior pulls his infamous tricks on people: blowing up barbecues, taping the bully to the chalkboard, videotaping his babysitter and her boyfriend having sex and broadcasting it for the whole neighborhood to see, same old same old. Meanwhile, Ben meets the gorgeous school nurse (after the school's satellite dish get's pushed on his head) and they, well he, believes it's love at first site, until he meets LaWanda Dumore, a greedy business women who wants to marry Ben and send Junior to boarding school--in Baghdad! So Junior and his new friend, Trixie, must get rid of LaWanda (any way possible!) to bring their parents together!",1039824000,2,1824,4.5920245398773005

Junior and Ben have left ""mother dearest"" and are now on their own.  They've moved, and if you think it's to escape trouble, you're wrong.  Junior is up to his old tricks.  He goes after everyone from bullys to the women of the town, and even the local terror, Trixie.  The two duke it out a bit before finally joining forces to thwart the plans of Big Ben Healy.  The movie has a lot of laughs, and even some heart.  If you love the first one, you'll love this one.

I find Little Ben, Junior and Trixie some of the most unfunny characters in the whole thing, and their parts are boring but are supplemented by the more funny supporting characters.
