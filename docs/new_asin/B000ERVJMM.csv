2530892,5,B000ERVJMM,"I loved this season, I loved this show and they cant come out fast enough for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1155081600,3,94,4.588235294117647
2530893,5,B000ERVJMM,"The eight season of Cheers offers some of the funniest episodes of the entire series.  The overall plotlines running through this season are primarily: 1) the introduction of Robin Colcord and his romance with Rebecca, 2) the birth of the Crane's child, Frederick, 3) the death of Eddie LeBec, and 4) Sam trying to save enough money to buy back the bar.

There are three episodes from this season that are particularly memorable for me. The first is ""What is... Cliff Claven"" where Cliff makes a hilarious appearance on the gameshow ""Jeopardy"" with categories like ""Mothers & Sons"" and ""Celibacy.""  The second is ""Two Girls for Every Boyd"" which features Woody getting the starring role in a community theater version of ""Our Town.""  This episode features one of the first acting roles of an actress that would be much more famous after co-starring in her own hit NBC show ""Friends,"" Lisa Kudrow, as an actress trying to help Woody get over some acting complications before opening night.  The third episode is ""Severe Crane Damage"" in where Lilith writes a book saying why women fall for bad boys rather than good guys and features Fraiser running around the bar, with scissors in his hand, to prove he is a member of the former group and not the latter.

Overall, this is one of the best seasons of one of the best comedy series ever made.  5 stars!!",1154304000,8,1352,4.703389830508475
2530894,5,B000ERVJMM,Another brilliant season of Cheers is here! This is my favorite sitcom of all time...it can't be beat. For all of those who love Cheers buy this DVD.,1152144000,6,149,4.357142857142857
2530895,5,B000ERVJMM,"Cheers is the greatest sitcom ever.  It has provided me many years of laughter.  When I was in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm, I had my wife tape the episodes for me.  Between her and the expectations of watching a whole group of Cheers episodes all at once, I made it back from playing war.  The quality of the DVD's from season #7 was poor.  Season #8 DVD's are top notch.  Can anyone tell me why Paramount WILL NOT release the seasons quicker?  It is absolutely stupid that we have to wait so long for the seasons to be released.  Let's get the final 3 out there damn it.",1150761600,9,576,4.220183486238532
2530896,5,B000ERVJMM,"Season 8 is filled with great episodes, my favorites being the ones involving Doris, Norm's secretary who falls irrationaly in love with him. The season culminates with the 2 part episode in which Sammy sells Robin Colcord to the feds and gets Cheers back, perhaps the highlight of the series. At that point I though the greatness of Cheers had no boundaries but then season 9 came along and the show went down the drains in a hurry.

Enjoy Season 8, after purchsing this and all previous Cheers seasons, this is where I get off !",1146009600,3,530,4.520833333333333
2530897,5,B000ERVJMM,"It's about time!! I've been waiting for what seems like forever for this to come out. Cheers is the greatest show of all time! It should be released quicker on dvd. This season has some of the greatest episodes of all time on it. From ""Improbable Dreams Parts 1+2"", to ""What is....Cliff Clavin"", when Cliff was on Jeopardy, which was named, by TV Guide as one of the funniest episodes of any show, of all time a couple of years ago, its all classic. I just wish we didn't have to wait 70 more days. Cheers: The Complete Eighth Season has long been awaited by us fans, and I'm going to reserve my copy weeks in advance. My only problem with these dvds, and I'm not gonna give less stars because of it, because the episodes are classic enough, is the lack of extras. I saw on this website some hilarious Cheers bloopers, and I would love to see them on dvd. But for whatever reason Paramount doesn't like to put extras on their dvds. But I would love some. But anyway, cheers to a classic tv show, that set the bar, no pun intended, so high, that every show after paled in comparison. Cheers is the best. I can't wait!!",1144108800,8,1117,4.298578199052133
2530898,4,B000ERVJMM,"In the 1989-90 season,the eighth,nothing really changed at the Cheers bar/restaurant. Well,Dr. Frasier Crane(Kelsey Grammer) and Lilith Sternin(Bebe Neuwirth) are getting real hot and heavy with their romance. Sometime around now,Sam Malone(Ted Danson) finally regained ownership of his bar,which he sold previously. Rebecca Howe(Kirstie Alley) was demoted to barmaid,so she's working when Carla Tortelli(Rhea Perlman) isn't. However,they'd work at the bar together at times. Cheers never made it to #1 in the Nielsen ratings this season,for that position was occupied by another NBC sitcom,The Cosby Show. Alley,at this time was a movie star,she wrapped up filming LOOK WHO'S TALKING with John Travolta before this season began. She also filmed MADHOUSE with John Larroquette,the star of another NBC hit sitcom,Night Court. Cheers continued for three more seasons following this one.",1143936000,4,884,5.8604651162790695
2530899,5,B000ERVJMM,"Paramount, you are taken way to long to get these out. Release the seasons monthly before I die of a heart attack waiting for the final seaseon to be released in 2007.",1143331200,6,167,4.25
2530900,5,B000ERVJMM,"""Cheers"" was one of those unique shows that both men and women alike could enjoy because everyone could relate to the characters. My favorite character was Carla because she was so obnoxious, and funny. How could anyone watch Carla without laughing?

2530901,5,B000ERVJMM,"After getting seasons 6 and 7 out at a reasonable timeframe, Paramount sat on this one for awhile. The continuing banter between Sam and Rebecca reaches a climax as we meet pathetic Rebecca's latest love, Robin Colcord. This season also introduces Frederick Crane (Frasier and Lilith's child) and features one of my favorite episodes, Cliff's appearance on Jeopardy! with a guest appearance by Alex Trebek.",1141344000,7,406,5.2615384615384615

2530927,4,B000ERVJMM,"I am watching the series on Netflix. I assume that these are the same prints used the the DVDs.  I am disappointed in the lazy job that was done in restoring the episodes or lack of restoration. It appears that certain shots were not restored and the picture gets dark and low res.  In  s08e10, The music and laugh track go off sync and the laugh track plays almost a whole minute delayed.  This is one of the best TV series of all time.  It is embarrassing that the Shows that are now so messed up online and on these DVD I assume.  Does anyone know if these issues were ever corrected in a recall disc program?  To many shows fell victim to sloppy restoration in the DVD Box set crazy era.  Someone needs to go back into the butchered episodes and  do right by this classic american series.  This would be a 5 star review if the prints used on the discs were all restored in full and if the sound was in sync.  this is a great season of Cheers and Thankfully most of the episodes do not have the sound sync issues.",1480377600,,1016,4.158974358974359

2530930,3,B000ERVJMM,"We watched Cheers during it's original run.  The first seasons were funny with a lot of creativity. But towards season 5 the writing started to get stale. Shelley Long bailed due to the repetitive story line and I think she was right.  While the addition of Woody, Frasier, and Lillith brought some fresh air to the show, by season 8 the show was struggling. Kirstie Alley is a fine comedian, but she could not overcome just plain bad writing.
The stories were often not funny at all and became a traffic accident in slow motion.  Still, we stuck in there out of admiration for Ted Danson and gang. About half way through Season 8, it became a hunt for anything that had Woody or Frasier in the main story line. The Sam Mallone character became a stooge which really hurt the show. That is a real shame.  I would not recommend the shows after season 5 in any television series including Cheers.  Instead of season 8, please watch the first few seasons. Cheers was magnificent fun.",1478390400,,980,4.545454545454546

I can identify with each of them on some level.  There's a little bit of everything ~ slapstick, sarcasm, poignancy, something that everyone should be able to identify with.

I love Sam Malone so much because no matter who or what he is, he has this big tender heart that wants to do good. He's always there for his friends and mostly, despite how much he and Diane hated one another, he was deeply in love with her. She would manipulate him and his heart would melt toward her, then she'd yank that rug out from under him. Through all that, he never stopped loving her.",1393372800,,725,4.2846715328467155

I was never a fan of her and I didn't enjoy the show as much once she came on the set. Frasier and his wife begin to get more screen time and of course Cliff and Norm are everyday patrons.

Then the cops would be called. Sometimes the bar would have to close early. In any case, I always stayed away from the trouble makers. And you can bet I got a lot of respect from the usual bar flies that frequented the place. All and all I had some good times.

2531344,4,B000ERVJMM,"Let's be realistic.  Cheers is a great show and I've watched the preceding 7 seasons before this one, but I would still have to say this is the weakest one I've seen yet.  In a nutshell, the first disc starts off reasonably but gets progressively weaker and  by the second disc you are in THE DOLDRUMS.  I gave up watching for a while I was so bored with it.  Later however I did push on as I'm not one to desert friends and by disc 3 it was picking up again and quite a bit so.  Disc 4 was quite good and the season ended with a bang, so that if season 9 ever comes down a bit in price, I will be picking it up.  However, I was almost ready to say I'd seen the best of it as I plodded through disc 2 and was about ready to hang the show up until things started getting much better in disc 3.  There were just no clever lines in disc 2.  Truly, it was no laughing matter.  I still think the Diane years, love her or hate her, were the best, but the Rebecca years have also had their very good moments.  If you've loved Cheers so far then you might as well continue with this season.  And chances are you'll be wanting more by the end of it.

Let's face it: you probably couldn't get this without Damages!

Ted Danson's a hot name on television once more thanks to his wonderfully wicked turn opposite Glenn Close in FX's legal drama, Damages. Since he's back in the limelight, CBS/Paramount has announced long-awaited DVD releases for Becker - The 1st Season, and also this morning for Cheers - Season 9!

The eighth season - which famously ends with Sam Malone (Danson) finally getting ownership of the bar back from the corporation he sold it to when Diane (Shelley Long) left - came out on DVD way back in June 2006. For a year and a half (and while spin-off series Frasier was completed on home video) fans of Cheers have desperately awaited some word of the last three season set releases: seasons 9, 10 and 11.

This morning CBS DVD and Paramount Home Entertainment revealed that Cheers - Season 9 will make it to DVD on April 29th with 25 half-hour episodes. Guest stars include Boston Celtic Kevin McHale, Arsenio Hall, Frances Sterghagen (returning as Cliff's mother), Bobby Hatfield of The Righteous Brothers, former 3-time Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, and former ""Agent 99"" (of Get Smart) Barbara Feldon. Stay tuned for package art and further details about this release, just as soon as we can get it!",1199750400,3,1337,4.946428571428571
2531387,5,B000ERVJMM,CHEERS IS ONE OF MY FAVORAITE SHOWS OF ALL TIME I WISH THEY WOULD RELEASE THE REST OF THE SEASONS I THINK THERE ARE 3 LEFT.I HOPE THE DONT DO WITH THIS SHOW WHAT THEY DID WITH QUINCY AND KOJACK,1192233600,4,193,3.85
2531388,5,B000ERVJMM,"Cheers, very simply, was one of the greatest situation comedies of all time.  And Season 8, first aired in 1989-90, was one of the best.  Some of the funniest episodes include the season premiere ""The Improbable Dream (Part 1)"" as well as ""The Stork Brings a Crane,"" ""The Art of the Steal,"" ""Feeble Attraction,"" ""Severe Crane Damage,"" ""50-50 Carla,"" and the two-part season finale ""Cry Hard"" and ""Cry Harder.""

It is my sincere hope that the remaining seasons of this fantastic TV series will be released.  I especially want to relive the classic wisecracks between Carla and John Allen Hill (owner of Melville's), which can only be found in the last three seasons.  In addition, I want to see Season 10's hilarious two-part finale (Woody and Kelly's wedding day) and of course the extraordinary series finale in which Shelley Long reprises her role of Diane Chambers.  If these remaining seasons ever get released, there are sure to be loads and loads of ""cheers.""",1187913600,5,965,4.889570552147239
2531389,5,B000ERVJMM,"""Cheers"" is one of the all time great sitcoms. Why the delay for Season 9? Usually Frasier and Cheers are released around the same time. The final season for ""Frasier"" is already out and Season 10 doesn t seem to be too far behind. Whats going on? I own the first 8 seasons and would really like to complete the collection.

2531393,4,B000ERVJMM,i have all 8 series of cheers so its hard for me to be critical of a show that gives me so much entertainment . The characters are fantastic as well as the one liners . I must admit i prefer shelley long to kirstie alley .,1163030400,,222,3.74468085106383
2531394,5,B000ERVJMM,"Season eight really shows us what Cheers is all about, possibly one of the best casts in the history of sitcoms along with bulletproof writing.

I've always been more of a Rebecca fan than Diane so these episodes are all gems.  I would say these are some of the best episodes, but in my mind the whole Rebecca era was solid gold.  Quality and sound excellent as always.

Not much else to say, the Cheers name is all there is to know, that alone is enough to buy this season set.",1157932800,4,478,4.21978021978022
