224843,2,6300208850,"I recall seeing the this movie in its original form.  This copy has been edited and some important scenes have been cut.  For instance the end of the film shows the fliers in a floating buoy, but the scenes before showing how they arrived and subdued the Nazies is missing.",1402185600,,273,4.44
224844,5,6300208850,"First off, I love old movies. Secondly, I love WWll movies and seeing this film was a true pleasure. I've seen many of the WWll American films and have many but I so enjoy watching movies like this one showing the British side of the war. Great acting and a VERY young Peter Ustinov. The female lead is captivating, such a strong character. Great film for WWll enthusiasts. The Dutch underground helps British pilots return home.",1373932800,,429,4.657894736842105

224846,3,6300208850,"One of Our Aircraft is Missing, 1942 film

This was produced with the co-operation of the RAF and the Royal Netherlands Government in London. In the summer of 1941 five Dutchmen were executed for helping members of the RAF to escape. This is their story. One April morning a British bomber did not return with the others. We see the members of the crew. [Note the blackboard used to record and display data.] Airmen listen to a soccer game on the radio. In the morning they enter their bomber and take off. We see the activities of the crew inside the bomber and their conversation. They fly towards the Dutch coast. There are flashes from anti-aircraft cannon. They first drop leaflets. A log records their journey. Searchlights on the ground sweep the skies. Buildings on the ground burn from the bombing. Their bomber flies lower to drop the bombs. One man destroys a piece of paper.

A hit on their bomber stops one engine, they fly lower. More trouble causes them to parachute from the bomber, the pilot is last. Daylight finds one of their crew is missing. Dutch children hunt for straying farm animals. Their dog finds the fliers up a tree. A safety pin is a symbol to keep quiet. They are brought to a house. A schoolteacher speaks and questions them. Are they who they say they are? They are given food. The sea is 58 km away. Can they hide in a church? Is it the right religion? They have a plan. Wearing clogs is part of their disguise. [If a man is disguised in a woman's dress would his height give him away?] You need a permit to travel in Occupied Holland. Bicycles are used to travel. The Germans found a parachute and are searching for its owner! A local collaborator visits this house and discovers the Englishmen. Was there a mix-up in the gramophone records? [What did they do to keep him silent?]

They travel by boat along a canal to watch a soccer game. They discover their missing crew member at the soccer game, well-disguised! A truck carries them to the seaside where they hide in a warehouse then a home. There is a plan to get them back to England during the next air raid when people seek shelter. This involves some risk from a few Germans. They will use a rowboat to find a fishing boat at sea. They must pass a guarded bridge, which opens to let fishing boats enter the harbor. A guard sees them and shoots at them. George is hurt. They stop at a station used for airmen shot down at sea. Two small boats arrive to rescue them. They must hurry because E-boats are coming. [Equivalent to PT boats.] Next stop Dover. Three months later they are back in service with a newer and bigger bomber. Four engine bombers can reach Berlin.

This is a slower-paced movie than some others from this era. It doesn't have much action and avoids any of the nasty events that were going on. You could read a book to learn more about the events in Occupied Holland at this time.",1358294400,,2893,4.452830188679245
224847,4,6300208850,I wanted to see a particular actor in his early days. In the end I was caught up in the story as well.,1357430400,,102,3.4782608695652173
224848,5,6300208850,That wonderfully so understated British style causes this to film underplay the tragic sacrifices of both Bomber Command and the civilian population of occupied Europe,1352505600,,167,5.72
224849,1,6300208850,"This is one of Powell/Pressburger's worthwhile WWII dramas, edited by David Lean, concerning the travails of a British bomber crew forced to bail out over German occupied Holland, and the heroic--based on real life occurrences--group of Dutch people that help them escape back to England at great peril to the Dutch.  One of the older British crewmen in this story gave rise to Powell-Pressburger's subsequent classic production of ""The Life And Death of Colonel Blimp"".

My problem is not with ""Aircraft..."" itself.  My problem is with the truly awful quality of this film print, both sound and picture.  You can barely see the image, and the audio is all but unintelligible.  For those cineastes who still want to collect this film, I would point them to the 2011 DVD version offered directly from Amazon.  It has no colorful artwork on the DVD case or disk label, but the print itself is quite good for a 60+ year old b/w film, at least 200% better than this print being reviewed here... a print which should never have been offered for sale in the first place. I sent mine back.  Buyer beware!",1340668800,6,1097,4.742105263157895
224850,4,6300208850,"This is a classic tale of aircrew down and escape. Notable for two things- actual use of early WWII Wellington bomber footage, and very intelligent use of a canal in creating suspense. Do not expect modern production values or special effects but for the time, both are quite good including a rather original crash scene. I suspect this DVD was mastered from a print used for TV broadcast in that there is a gap in the plot continuity near the end. The characters are predictable and somewhat wooden with most of the usual suspects in this type of movie. But for the fan of the classic 1940's black and white era at both Rank and Ealing (or a WWII aviation buff) go for this movie.",1317168000,,681,4.456
224851,3,6300208850,"The film is quite good, and doesn't have any feel of being a propaganda movie; if I were never told that it was financed by the British Ministry of Information, I certainly wouldn't have guessed it. The story is simple but filled with character, detail, suspense and humor, and the fellowship of the British airmen and the Dutch resistance in the face of their common enemy is quite touching. The cinematography is striking as well, particularly the tension-filled scenes inside the Dutch church. Fans of Powell & Pressburger will definitely want to check it out.

Unfortunately, the quality of the Alpha Video DVD is surprisingly poor. It seems to have been mastered not from a film copy but from an old videotape. The sound in particular is very poor quality, and the dialogue is incomprehensible in the scenes inside the plane because of the background sound of the propellers. Amazingly, Alpha Video superimposes their logo over the credits, just in case anyone is wondering at that moment who to blame such a crummy-looking product.

I suppose even a poor copy of the movie is better than no copy at all, but DVDs like this really make one appreciate the work that the Criterion Collection does.",1317081600,,1200,4.848780487804878
224883,5,6300208850,"Rating applies to the film as I imagine it could be, if properly reproduced. Fortunately, the original 102 minute version and not the cut USA version is available. The DVD sound reproduction is so bad that subtitles are needed.",1295654400,,227,4.846153846153846
224884,4,6300208850,"I was glad to see this movie released on DVD.  We had an old, grainy VHS tape of the film which was hard to watch.  I am surprised that ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT IS MISSING is not more well known because it really is a good story.  Five British soldiers escape from their aircraft before it crashes.  They land in Holland and are rescued by Dutch citizens working with the resistance against the Nazis.  The story is about how the soldiers are transferred to a few towns before reaching the sea and a rescue ship.  At times they are just one jump ahead of the Nazis.  Very good characterizations all along the way -- British movies are good at this.  The quality of the film is still not great, but that is a small criticism.  You will enjoy an interesting story and a part of history.",1286323200,,779,4.280821917808219
224885,3,6300208850,"...the film itself is rather tame, nonviolent, a little blood at the end. A quite extended sequence, of barely perceptible tension, shows the bomber crew on their way to the target in Germany. On the way back to England, they have to bail out over Holland. In the bits showing the German occupiers of the Netherlands, they are clumsy bunglers, easily eluded. The Hollanders are clean, tidy, dozens of them ready, willing, and able to help the six downed crew members. Underground workers Pamela Brown and Googie Withers are women of iron, adamant that their homeland will endure. Robert Helpmann, a German-collabo, is immediately detestable with his popping eyes and tight little suit, and is quickly outsmarted. Peter Ustinov as the minister is startlingly young, and already unique in aura.

So the six crewmen manage to boat out into the North Sea and meet the rescue vessel. Then a trifle cutely, the film is interrupted by a note that the story was supposed to end at this point, but some of the film crew insisted they wanted a bit more, not to be left hanging. So the film resumes...

Michael Powell's staging of the scenes, the camerawork by Ronald Neame, and the editing by David Lean are masterly--the real reason to see this film. The print is quite good. But I found the audio semi-intelligible (those rapid English deliveries also contributed), tubby, as if the upper frequencies had been sheared off to clean up the soundtrack.",1283385600,,1441,4.853658536585366
224886,5,6300208850,"To those who do not know the genre, or are old enough to have contact with those who were there, this film is more than entertainment - it is instructional. The story is the (presumably true) tale of five british aviators who escaped from Nazi occupied Holland during WWII. They hide in lofts, cross dress and paddle down sewers to evade the crafty huns, with more than a little help from the natives. We get to know them as people and the Dutch as well, seeing that those involved in the struggle, both victim and liberator are real people escaping real evil. B&W suits this, and a pristine print would be, I think, disappointing. More than worth watching, it is inspiring - which I guess is the idea. Wait for the end soliloquy of the resistance woman who arranges the liberation of the aviators. She pretends by day to be a collaborator, but by night works for the resistance. During an air raid, in darkness from a second floor apartment, she hears the air raid sirens and watches from the window the Germans below scurrying to evade the bombs. Paraphraasing, she says, ""Do you see that? Do you see them running like rats from your bombs? Do you think that we Dutch who threw the sea from our land would endure the Nazis? ..."" Chilling stuff from a time of real heroes and villains. Don't pass this one up.",1231459200,16,1310,4.485355648535565
224887,3,6300208850,"A fair print but as we are unable to get a pristine one, this is worthwhile. A mirror of their previous film 'The 49th Parallel'
Anything from the' Archers' is worth the expense and the trouble",1229385600,11,193,4.388888888888889
224888,4,6300208850,"""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"" is a fairly typical 1941 propagandized black and white documentary style film chronicling the heroism of the R.A.F.

A crew of six flying a bombing mission into the heart of the German industrial city of Stuttgart gets hit by anti aircraft fire and sustains engine damage.  The crew including veteran British actors Godfrey Tearle, Eric Portman and Bernard Miles, must abandon their plane on the way back to base.  They parachute into German occupied Holland, some 40 miles from possible rescue at the North Sea.

They are discovered by friendly local villagers who feed and hide them and coordinate their escape and return to England.  Led by a patriotic school teacher Else Merteens played by Pamela Brown who is a member of the Dutch underground, the crew's escape is orchestrated under the noses of the hated Nazis.

The film serves as both a testament to the determined fliers of the Royal Air Force and the courage of the Dutch people who fought against the oppression of the Germans.",1136937600,2,1023,4.850574712643678
224889,5,6300208850,"One of Our Aircraft Is Missing is a British propaganda film from 1941; leaving aside the propaganda aspects, it is a well-made motion picture that was nominated for best original screenplay as well as best special effects at the 1942 American Academy Awards (Casablanca took best picture). It also did quite well at the box office. The British bomber Bertie takes a hit during a nighttime bombing raid over Stuttgart, Germany, and her six-man RAF crew is forced to parachute to safety over German-occupied Dutch territory. Five of the men are discovered by some friendly children and are taken to town where an English-speaking schoolteacher helps facilitate their escape. The men are furtively passed along the sixty or so miles to the North Sea through a veritable underground railroad of Dutch resistance, eventually linking up with the pilot they feared had been lost. Interestingly, the most heroic assistance comes from women like the schoolteacher Els Mertens and the truly remarkable Jo de Vries. De Vries supposedly hates the British for having killed her husband in an air raid and works closely with the local German forces whom she secretly despises; this makes her the perfect final contact for the English airmen seeking to return home by sea. The final stages of the great escape do prove somewhat harrowing, but the RAF men do honor to the ancient creed of ""being British"" throughout the most dangerous moments. De Vries delivers a stirring ovation for the resistance and war efforts, and any Englishman or American who didn't already hate the Germans would have been more than willing to take up arms immediately and rush off to The Netherlands to free this remarkable woman and her friends in the Dutch resistance from Hitler's nefarious grip. One of the more interesting aspects of the film has to do with the Dutch resistance in general; the Dutch have a way of obeying German orders in a way that never fails to get under the occupying soldiers' skins. One of Our Aircraft Is Missing proves that propaganda can sometimes have a completely positive connotation, and the story itself is well-presented and quite timeless in its appeal.",1127520000,,2154,4.986111111111111

uniformly perfect.  All of the stars act with a natural grace

7804982,4,6300208850,"I enjoyed this film. It is a thriller of English pilots who fall in Nazi-occupied Holland after their plane is struck down by the Nazis. The story shows how the Dutch Resistance helps these British pilots escape the Nazi-occupied territory. While celebrating the heroics of the Dutch Resistance and the British soldiers, the film avoids the usual cliches often associated with these kind of films. Absence of blind gung-hoism, it remains a great story of people struggling for their freedom in the worst of times, and I think it is a pity that this film has not received the treatment of other Powell and Pressburger films. Perhaps for this reason I give the film 4 stars. In spite the fact that this film is in desperate need for restoration, the images and the audio are good enough to enjoy the story. Films reproduced by Alpha, although lacking the visual and audio quality of a Criterion treatment or of other major distributors, still delivers a product that is, at least, satisfactory and enjoyable if a good story is what I'm looking for.

Nothing against this film -- I am a fan of everything else I've seen by Powell and Pressburger and I expect I would at least enjoy this movie in other circumstances.  I now realize I've been taking the restorations offered by Criterion for granted.  The picture here is badly in need of restoration (which I was expecting), but the audio is a bigger problem for me.  The sound is so muddy that I can't make out much of the dialogue, which itself wouldn't be that big a deal (I knew this was an inexpensive DVD so was not expecting much) except that there is no option for subtitles, which made simply following the plot an exercise in frustration.",1409184000,,701,4.5396825396825395
