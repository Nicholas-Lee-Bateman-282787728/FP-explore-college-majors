8360817,5,B002B8UU7M,"I've been waiting for this movie to become available on DVD for about my whole life. Seriously, when I was just old enough to go with my sister to our little hometown theater we saw this movie. It's one of about three that I can remember from them. I think I've dated myself. Anyway, I remembered also playing the roles later with Sister and some other kids, and among the usual characters, Tarzan and Jane, this one required a ""Lola."" I forget who got to be Lola.
I must say that after sixty some years my review of the direction, writing, acting won't be quite as positive as it was back then, but I didn't buy it for the film's artistic merit; it was just a memories-of-childhood thing. (But, the DVD transfer is pretty good.)",1440115200,2,729,4.407407407407407
8360818,4,B002B8UU7M,"He actually was one of the better Tarzans you never see him on TV, he was ignored initially in Hollywood because he ocssionally wore something on his feet",1407715200,,154,4.535714285714286
8360819,3,B002B8UU7M,It is too bad it could not have continue with the  feeling of the mastic of the previous Tarzan with Lex Barker. It seemed flat but Lex Barker seemed a worthy replacement for Mr Weissmuller. I think I enjoyed the idea of the Tarzan legend continued with perfectly conditioned athlete. The phony back drop special effects were not so special. The fact of few black Africans in the movie really took away from the story.,1401235200,,418,4.573333333333333
8360820,5,B002B8UU7M,"This is thirty year old Lex Barker's first film as Tarzan, after Johnny Weissmuller retired because of being 44. He does an excellent job. He speaks English in sentences, without prepositions. He uses the Tarzan yell a couple of times when he is in trouble, and an elephant is able to decipher it to mean ""break down a wall about twenty feet from where you are standing, over on the right."" Needless to say, we civilized humans would find it impossible to distinguish this command from what appears to be the same vocalizations used in other films for other purposes.

The producers of the Tarzan films seem to title the films to entice men to go see it by suggesting that sex is involved and a certain female is the sexual figure. Thus, in this case, although many females were captured, the producers lead potential viewers to believe that there is one sex captivating figure.

What happened? Some people of a tribe of sick people kidnap some females and Tarzan's Jane to help them repopulate their nation. Tarzan follows with a physician and some tribal members of the tribe of the kidnapped women to help rescue the women and immunize the sick tribe. As in many Tarzan films, it is difficult, if not impossible, to understand why some African tribes in the films are Caucasians and others are blacks. These problems aside, the film is fun to watch.",1310256000,2,1352,4.676470588235294
8360821,3,B002B8UU7M,"First: WB Archieves are to expensive for no subtitles, Chapter etc and not restored.

But the movie itself is very interesting and I bought it only because I wanted see Hurd Hatfield (""the picture of Dorian Gray""). Also nice to see french actress Denise Darcel.
Anthony Caruso play another bad guy role.

Lex Barker is in Germany/Switzerland/Austria best remembered for those german Western movies ""Winnetou 1-3"", ""The Treasure in the Silver Lake"" etc of the novel-author Karl May.

Sound and picture are ok.
No bonus features.",1287014400,,527,5.104651162790698
8360822,4,B002B8UU7M,"Before I review this edition of ""Tarzan and the Slave Girl"", let me give you all the negatives; the Warner Archive Collection at the WB site sells this title for nearly $6 less than Amazon; there are no special features, subtitles, nor even a scene index; the encrypting process prevents this DVD from playing on any DVD player with recording capabilities (which means you probably won't be able to play this on your PC).

There are a LOT of 'positives', though! The second Lex Barker outing as Tarzan has a truly amazing cast, certainly the best of his five films as the Lord of the Jungle. While Vanessa Brown (""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir""), replacing Brenda Joyce as Jane, lacks Joyce's sexiness and sparkle, her 'competition', sultry French star Denise Darcel (""Vera Cruz""), made her career as a temptress, and she's terrific! Add to this Robert Alda (""Rhapsody in Blue"", and Alan Alda's father) as her funny if a bit tipsy boyfriend, Hurd Hatfield (""The Picture of Dorian Gray"") as the ruler of yet another Caucasian tribe in darkest Africa, veteran bad guy Anthony Caruso, as his henchman, Arthur Shields (""The Quiet Man"", and Barry Fitzgerald's brother), as a dedicated jungle doctor, and Robert Warwick (""The Adventures of Don Juan"") as a high priest, and you have an ensemble that could rival the best of the Johnny Weismuller 'Tarzan' outings! Other 'pluses' include better production values than most of the series (including an impressive, Egyptian-style tomb), some funny 'bits' by Cheeta, and a fast-paced story (only 74 minutes long!), and you have a first-rate 'B'-movie.

The plot is simple; a tribe, suffering from a rare, fatal disease, is raiding local villages and stealing their most beautiful women for the ruler's harem; Tarzan, accompanied by a doctor and his right-hand man, journey to their secret village to recover the women and bring a serum, little realizing Jane and the doctor's sexy assistant are among the captives. Lots of action, comedy, and a bit of romance spice up the proceedings, climaxing with a rip-roaring brawl!

This is certainly 'THE' Lex Barker Tarzan film to own!",1252022400,6,2110,4.971671388101983
