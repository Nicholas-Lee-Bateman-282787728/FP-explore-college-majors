1789453,5,B00006RJSG,"Amazing concert DVD, tons of replay value.  I only wish they did Space Cowboy but this is still well worth the money.",1141948800,2,117,4.318181818181818
1789454,5,B00006RJSG,"This stunning concert DVD has EVERYTHING going for it: great set list, superb sound, great camera work and unobtrusive editing, and a beautiful setting in the Verona (Italy) ampitheater. And then there's the infectious charisma - and incredible dancing - of singer/frontman Jay Kay.

If you're new to Jamiroquai, it's got a hip hint of 70s Stevie Wonder but with a thoroughly modern, unabashedly joyful, and gotta-dance club beats. Highly recommended.",1126137600,10,451,5.352112676056338
1789455,5,B00006RJSG,"This DVD makes you feel you're among the crowd in Verona watching Jay Kay strutting his stuff on stage, even while the rains poured. In here are songs like his rendition of Bad Girls, the hits Cosmic Girl, Love Foolosophy, among others. Electric performances, awesome music and cool extras like the pre-show documentary  make this DVD a must-buy and must-keep.",1098403200,14,360,5.0
1789456,5,B00006RJSG,This was an incredible concert w/ so much energy. This is definitely something you will watch over and over - I only wish I could have seen this live. this dvd version of his concert is reallly professional - the editing is superb.,1094688000,12,231,4.395348837209302
1789457,5,B00006RJSG,"When I first heard this band back in '94, I was ""who are this guys who gave funk a twist of jazz?"", great music, ideal for relaxing and dancing, the bass is incredible so is their harmony. The 90's was a very dry era for music. Few bands will be remembered for their brilliant contribution to music. Is very likely that if you have 2 cd's from this band you will buy it no matter what, but if you have only one, TRY IT!!, you will be attracted by the way these guys enjoy the music they developed, Jamiroquai music is for happy people, and their sound is unique.",1093478400,9,562,4.165137614678899
1789458,5,B00006RJSG,I saw this concert on Bravo a couple of weeks ago. It blew my mind. I didn't even know I was a Jamiroquai fan but they had me dancing around my living room early in the morning. I can't wait to have my own copy. Can't believe it took me this long to discover a truly amazing band.,1093219200,9,280,3.8448275862068964
1789534,3,B00006RJSG,"First, as others have said, the performance is not lacking in any way.  Great set list, band is on spot, band and crowd energy is through the roof.  My issues are with the DVD itself.

My case arrived with a broken hinge - not the end of the world, but frustrating.  The video editing isn't the best either.  There are very few good shots of the rest of the band, and when there are, they last for no more than a second or 2 (no exaggeration)!

And now the real issue - the region code.  The Amazon listing labels the region as ""All"", and the back of the case even says 100% playability. This is not true - this disc does not play in American DVD players.  Fortunately, I was able to change some settings to get one of my computer's media players to play the disc.  If it wasn't for that, I'd be making a return.",1355356800,,812,4.1210191082802545
1789535,5,B00006RJSG,"One reason I am glad I bought that DVD player is because this is in PAL format. The first song twenty zero one lets you know these guys aren't goofing around. I have never heard jazz, funk and driving rock played so well. The musicians are all powerful on their instruments. Of course Jay Kay delivers great vocals to intertwine between all the heavy beats and great hooks. Canned Heat follows the first song and on it goes.

We also have the classic rain storm but unlike Woodstock, Jay Kay did not initiate a rain chant so it kept raining.........and the band played on. They played on without any compromise to the performance in fact because this band did troop on so well, it probably added to the show. Those in the audience I am sure will tell you it did push the whole show up a notch.

I think this is infectous and don't see how anyone could not like at least one song on this. Get it.",1355270400,,895,4.289940828402367
1789536,4,B00006RJSG,"i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my box came with a big slash on the side of it, a pen knife slash. cut through the plastic and the paper insert. but dvd works fine",1331683200,,170,3.6216216216216215
1789537,5,B00006RJSG,"I see what the other review means about not showing the rest of the group more .... they had to be feelin' it the way they grooved.  They were TIGHT!  I mean, they were just in sync, and I would have loved to have seen more of them.  But Jay was groovin' too... his adlibs flow, his style of dance is all his own.  Only a true fan would appreciate all of the visual he gives.  I used to sing back up, and can appreciate the energy that flows when you perform.  The backround vocals throughout this concert are harmonious and I wish I was right there with them!

But my favorite tracks are Canned Heat, Bad Girls, High Times, the song with Beverly Knight (You've Been Tryin' to Mess with my Head, I think) and my favorite, favorite most favorite song is ""Spend the Night Together""... I love the studio version of this, too. Virtual Insanity was good, but the other songs just blew me away.

Definately buy this concert...you won't be disappointed.",1319846400,,946,4.396551724137931
1789538,5,B00006RJSG,This is an amazing live show. It is pouring rain and J just performs his butt off. It is just perfect Jamiroquai and the crowd is massive and loving.,1289865600,2,149,4.172413793103448
1789539,3,B00006RJSG,"Awesome sound, great live arrangements of their best tunes, beautiful set, great musicians, HORRIBLE video editing! I agree with other reviewers that this was a great concert, but the video? WOW what a frustrating disappointment. I would have given it 5 stars but the editing ruined it for me because we hardly got to see anything but Jay Kay strutting and singing (in that order).

For those of you who wanted a ""lead singer prance and dance"" video this will thrill you. But those of you who wanted to actually SEE this band of funkmasters get their groove on, might as well just turn up the volume and turn off the TV because you don't get to see squat. Let me put it in numbers for you:

Proportion of video footage showing the lead singer singing lyrics 50%
Proportion of video footage showing the lead singer being pretty, squirming around, and waving his hands in the air, while some of the funkiest musicians in the business groove out off-camera 49.9%
Proportion of video footage showing the musicians 0.1%

Seriously, the average shot length of the singer is around 5 seconds. The average shot length of a musician is about 5 microseconds. We see each musician once or twice a song for about two beats, just to check and see if they're still there, then it cuts back to the singer prancing around, and he's not even that good at it. During the instrumental and solo sections, instead of showing the musicians getting funky, we see twenty-second shots of the singer shaking hands with the audience. WTF?

Anybody who knows Jamiroquai knows that this band is not just a lead singer with extras. for crying out loud there's two percussionists, and the bass player has a 5-string bass (and knows what to do with it) but the first time we see his face is in the third track, and by that time we've seen his hands maybe three times for a total of about seven notes.

Aside from that glaring problem, this video would be great. The set looks really cool, like a metal Aztec pyramid (though you hardly ever get to see it), they play some pretty cool adaptations of their tunes, and the sound is fantastic. It's just too bad because the MTV reject they found to edit the video thinks it's a Brittney Spears concert.

I love Jamiroquai. I think they're some of the funkiest, grooviest dudes around. But we only get to see one dude in this show.",1231718400,2,2343,4.553444180522566
1789540,5,B00006RJSG,"Absolutely AWESOME show beginning to end. Great energy, performance, and quality. You will not be disappointed!",1200960000,,111,6.0
1789541,5,B00006RJSG,"I'm a big fan of Jamiroquai. However, I have only seen them live once ever and that concert was a bit of a disappointment really. It was at the Filmore in SF in late 2005. I thought the band seemed a little tired (it was their next to last stop in the US after already doing a European tour). Anway, after that I didn't think Jamiroquai was a good live band and just good on CDs. Well this DVD proves that wrong. The Verona Italy show is great. Jay doesn't let the horrible weather (heavy rain at an outdoor venue) get in his way and neither do any of the band. They put on a great show ... sounded like their album tracks and the set/stage was well done. They rocked Italians' world. If you want to see one of the top funk/rock/pop bands at their live best this is the DVD for you.",1182902400,,782,4.084415584415584
1789542,5,B00006RJSG,"Jamiroquai front-man Jay Kay is an incredible performer! This DVD is a must buy for any Jamiroquai fan!

Kay is dancing, running, and jumping all up and down the stage the whole length of the show. About mid-way through, it starts to rain. While most audiences and performers would be put off by this and either wait it out or commence early, Jay Kay turns it up another notch as do the fans. He starts running and slides (much like a young Tom Cruise did in Risky Business while singing  Bob Seger's ""Old Time Rock 'n' Roll"" in his jockeys) across the wet stage while belting out his powerful vocals!

I loved it!",1158019200,,614,4.415929203539823
1789543,5,B00006RJSG,"I've enjoyed Jamiroquai's music for years, but never got a chance to see them in concert. Though it took me a while, I got my hands on this DVD and I absolutely adore it! Watching it made me dust off ""A Funk Odyssey"" - a CD I didn't like upon first hearing. However, the concert made me appreciate the music on it alot. One cool thing about the DVD is the multi-angle feature enabling you to view the concert from different vantage points. There's also a little documentary (mainly a camera following Jay Kay around) and that was a nice addition. I'm glad I found the DVD - a definite MUST for Jamiroquai fans.",1150243200,,610,4.359649122807017

I love that one video he had with the furniture gliding. That said, I have a vast array of likes in music from Priest to Floyd, classic rock, alternative, some disco and old school rap. This is one bad man pajama, very funky and disco esque. But this DVD, once I changed format region to 2 was viewable on my pc hooked to TV in the US. Five star performer. Excellent, thank you fellow reviewers great choice. If you are reading, buy from amazon and be watching instead ;>)",1446595200,,484,4.271739130434782
7972722,5,B00006RJSG,absolutely jumping to the roof energy!! amazingly recorded epic concert!,1434240000,,72,6.3
7972723,5,B00006RJSG,"Great concert despite the rain.... BUT, it's coded zone 0 and should play in ANY player. It does not play in a standard NTSC player - at least not mine. I have a hacked player that is set to play 0 and plays disks from anywhere... Can't ding the quality of the product just because it doesn't play as advertised.
The concert at Verona is definitely in the rain and it is heavy rain but it doesn't dampen the spirits of the crowd or the band... Typical Jamiroquai performance - Thank you Marta Altesa for turning me on to the band...",1422316800,,532,4.2772277227722775
7972724,1,B00006RJSG,"Don't get this wrong. I love the group, jamiroquai. However, the disc I recieved was the European version even though it said ""all regions."" I ordered it as a gift and was highly disappointed when we got an error on the screen saying that it could not be played. Too late to scramble for another gift...",1420329600,,303,4.428571428571429

7972726,5,B00006RJSG,"always a bonus to watch the frontman get down and dirty by dancing in the rain and making a mess of his costumes. it is a break away from the pristine, secluded, perfection geared world of western society. the set list includes songs of how sad people become in the secular world. he breaks the mold by throwing caution to the wind and inspiring everyone to let loose and just have some fun.",1384300800,,391,4.36986301369863
7972727,1,B00006RJSG,"It does not work in US Blu-ray DVD players apparently. So, now I am out my money and have a useless DVD on my hands.
