Volume 2 is a pressed disc and should last for decades.  Volume 1 is a burned disc. Sadly, not burned on M-DISC.  Alpha Video used the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that is only good for around 5 - 7 years.  I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  M-Disc last 100s of years.

The movies themselves are terrific. The video and audio audio quality is an 8 of 10.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.",1509753600,,812,4.513698630136986

I can not tell  all the technical stuff, but I was  able to enjoy these films. Thank you Mr Lugosi I love what you did for all of us to enjoy. I am saddened that you died in a bad way!",1397952000,,358,3.6363636363636362
