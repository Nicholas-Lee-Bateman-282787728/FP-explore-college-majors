Here Langdon plays Tim, the operator of a carnival shooting gallery, and Ben Lyon plays Georgie, occupation unknown, whom we first meet at a poker game being played in a bookie's office from the looks of the surroundings, with bookie Hank (Fred Kohler) and associates. Apparently Georgie and Tim are buddies, and also apparently Georgie routinely cleans out Hank and his associates at their poker games. When an extra ace is discovered after George collects his winnings and leaves, Hank jumps to the conclusion that George cheated and tracks him down to face off with him over it. In self defense George hits Hank hard enough that he crashes through the railing of the rooming house hallway in which they are arguing and falls several stories. Being chased by both Hank's gang and the police, and with Hank not looking particularly alive the last time he saw him, George decides to hide by - joining the army??? (The time is WWI).

The U.S. army is NOT the French Foreign Legion, and the police would have no trouble tracking George down if they so desired, but that's beside the point apparently. Tim has already joined the army, so the rest of the movie is set in Europe with Lyon and Langdon as two privates in the war with the rest of the script just being a bunch of comic bits strung together like so many disconnected comic Vitaphone shorts. There really is not much of a story here. The odd thing about it is that all of the soldiers shown here in ""the army of occupation"" as it is blandly called by the title cards, inexplicably see less combat action than marine Gomer Pyle saw at the height of the Vietnam War - which was absolutely none. Instead they shovel horse manure when they run afoul of the gruff captain, played by Noah Beery in a role that reminded me very much of his brother, and spend the rest of their time drinking, singing, and fraternizing with the local Germans who don't seem at all bothered by the fact that they are being occupied and treat them like tourists.

I'm no expert on WWI, but somehow I don't think this was a typical wartime experience. As for the comedy, I found Ben Lyon likable as always, doing the best he could with comedy material that was obviously meant to give the spotlight to Langdon. I like Langdon in his silents, but here he just seemed to wrestle with incorporating the dialogue he was given with his traditional befuddled expressions and slapstick from his silent years.

Oddest scene/line in the film: Tim and George want to escape the MPs by donning the horse costume that two of the German saloon performers were wearing, but they are getting nowhere with these two fellows due to the language barrier. George turns to Tim and says : ""Let's just knock these two guys off"". That stunned me and I replayed this section of the DVD just to make sure I didn't misunderstand what was being said - I didn't. George, who has not been portrayed as anything more than a rather streetwise fellow up to this point is suggesting killing two men to escape punishment for being in a bar off-limits to military personnel? This seemed like overkill to me (pardon the pun) and something that belonged more in Little Caesar than in a buddy war pic.

I'd recommend this one mainly for fans of Harry Langdon and early sound enthusiasts.

As for the transfer - both sound and picture quality are excellent. I don't know if Warner Brothers did any restoration work, but it looks and sounds great - no hissing at all in the soundtrack, which is so common in the early talking films.",1371340800,,3657,4.577099236641222

That was FOX MOVIETONE FOLLIES OF 1929 (70MM). I have  nine of the films on dvd that were made and am  only missing  KISMET (1931)  and Fox Follies. A SOLDIER'S PLAYTHING  was filmed in 65mm (Vitascope).This film  ,when first released, used interlocked Vitaphone discs for the soundtrack. Does anyone have a copy of KISMET (1931)? I would be interested in buying  a copy.",1334275200,,540,4.739130434782608
8514795,3,B007CZ3DL4,"Well, it's not a particularly good story and it's not a particularly good movie, but Harry Langdon captivates my attention with anything he does, and he's onscreen here a lot.  This is a particularly attention-grabbing film because Langdon plays absolutely the same character as his ""elf"" in the silent movies, but with added words and sound-effects (his).  Watch him carefully in his silents and you'll see that he does talk... in fact he's ALWAYS talking!  Now you get to hear what he was saying in all those movies (it's pretty much the same thing all the time).

Of course it's a shame this is not fully a ""Langdon movie"", but he does get ample time do his shtick, with sound. And it is hilarious, if sometimes a little out of control.  He seems to have been given a lot of freedom to do his little routines the way he wanted, and even gets to sing a song! I do wish that there were not so much ancillary ""story"", which is always unnecessary in comedy, and always causes comedy films to drag; I wish that the other main character was more comical and that they worked better as a team; and I wish that the ends of the scenes were not so abrupt: the black-outs sometime actually fade out on the characters during or even before the final joke of the sequence (like costume-horse being hit by the motorcar--what's the result??).  But if you can't get enough of Harry Langdon, then I think you should pick this up.  He gets the spotlight as much as anyone else, his pantomime is typically mesmerizing, and I actually think that his vocalizations add to the character.

The picture quality is very good, and the sound is mostly clear.  I have to warn you that during the first part of the film, the sound is not quite in sync with the picture.  Of course Warner Brothers states up front that the film is not ""restored"", but how much trouble would it have been to re-sync this part of the movie before selling it?  It takes quite literally about three minutes on Final Cut to do this.  Fortunately, his little song is in proper sync.

Recommended to Langdon fans.",1331510400,3,2062,4.49597855227882
