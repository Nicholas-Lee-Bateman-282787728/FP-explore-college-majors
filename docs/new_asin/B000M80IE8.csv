Jesse Duplantis is an amazing, down to earth preacher that will make you think anybody would have to be crazy to not want to have such a wonderful God in their life and that is why I call this woman the Jesse Duplantis of dog trainers because her methods are WOW! She is a master of the concept of letting a dog know both when he is wrong AND when he is right so he can easily figure out what you are asking! She doesn't just like beat on the dogs until she can scare them into doing what she wants. She actually makes them WANT to work. She makes them realize that if they do what she wants good things are bound to follow. I have always said that you have much more control over a dog when you control it's mind, not it's body. With purely negative training the dog behaves just to avoid you hurting it. With this the dog behaves because it wants to. And when a dog wants to listen to you, you have 100% total control!",1175212800,2,1032,4.0588235294117645
