8379108,4,B002S5PSAW,By today's standards it is an old fashioned movie. The story is very true to the bible and has been shown in churches. I enjoyed it very much and also learned from it.,1372550400,3,167,4.090909090909091
8379109,5,B002S5PSAW,"Follow the Life of Christ on 4 DVD's, that are of excellent quality, and perfect for the whole family, friends, churches, and absolutely anyone to enjoy.",1369267200,3,153,4.923076923076923
8379110,5,B002S5PSAW,"Yet another repackaging of the Living Christ Series produced by the Rev. James K. Friedrich (12 films, Cathedral Films Inc.) For it's time this was an excellent series and today it still holds up very well due to the professional cast and well-thought out scripting that weaves a intricate story that includes all the various facets and power struggles surrounding the life of Jesus Christ, this is certainly not a wooden and lifeless documentary film.

Beware that you do not wind up purchasing this in duplicate sets as there are quite a few other distributors with the same 12 films using different titles, number of discs/tapes and artwork, mostly that isn't representative of the age of the product inside the boxes. One group even foolishly edited out all the original titles (along with some of the program footage as well). Check the individual episode names to verify if possible.",1367280000,4,889,4.966442953020135

8379112,1,B002S5PSAW,I was very disappointed with this Life of Christ DVD set. It is extremely outdated and the quality of the film is very poor. I advice you not to waste your money on this.,1311206400,5,170,4.029411764705882
8379113,5,B002S5PSAW,Where alot of movies are filled with foul language and not really Biblical in substance. This is a great old movie for those who like nostalgic movies. Where not all in order to the events it adds a nice twist to the newer movies and adds a human aspect of our LORD's Nature without losing all truth which is nice. Well worth the purchase.,1272585600,7,339,4.3125
