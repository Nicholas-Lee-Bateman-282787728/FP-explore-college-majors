8499026,3,B006IY1NOY,Great video but the voice over was monotone hard to head.  Needed more volume and emphasis.,1466208000,,91,4.6875
8499027,1,B006IY1NOY,"I purchased this DVD for use in a classroom. I was able to use it once; then, it stopped working. The information on the DVD was adequate, but it was not very entertaining or engaging.",1461542400,,184,4.285714285714286

8499030,4,B006IY1NOY,"Part 2 of a 2 part series. Very interesting!
Clearly a great deal of ""propaganda"" in the conclusions drawn as to the meaning & significance of the discoveries. But the archaeology itself seems sound enough & the discoveries are truly magnificent! Discoveries of huge significance worldwide, not exclusively to Chinese history. Also, some of the observations about bronze age culture is probably applicable to any civilization of that era.",1410393600,,438,5.36231884057971
8499031,1,B006IY1NOY,"Together with stock footage of generic early Chinese communist archeological digs, this film's format of laying out a brief historic background and then simply showing artifact after artifact with no commentary on the artifacts themselves makes for a particularly unenlightening watch. Does not use the medium of film well. Almost like a book with audio.",1401926400,,354,5.454545454545454
