2827931,2,B000PSPRV4,"in the version I received,although the movie soundtrack is in English, when you first put in the dvd it gives you a choice of which of the scandinavian languages you want the sub-titles to be in. At no point then or later is there an option for having no sub-titles. Also they are in thick white letters, and are very obtrusive.",1264723200,10,328,4.39344262295082
2827932,3,B000PSPRV4,"Even though the film falls short of the book and it was made on a limited budget(reason for which I gave it only 3 stars) it was still entertaining. I wish some big studios would bring to life all the other books written by Sven Hassel. Adventure,action,carnage,war and humour would all interact in these movies if only someone would invest time and money...but since the Danish hold all the rights for making movies based on Sven's books...there's not much chance of seeing them on the screen and in the style that only the Yanks could produce.
The movie is about a group of german soldiers who hate nazis that are sent behind enemy lines to blow up a strategical railway/depot,more or less it is a one way ticket.",1215907200,11,715,4.59375

2827952,4,B000PSPRV4,"I had this movie years ago on VHS & liked it, before mine disappeared. Finally, after all this time, it's been released in DVD format. I was a fan of the many Sven Hassel WW2 novels as a teen, & always hoped these world wide bestsellers would finally see the big screen. And my favorite of the ten books by Sven that I read, 'Wheels of Terror' finally did. It's too bad the producers couldn't have used real German armored vehicles, instead of Soviet ones, as that would have sure added to the authenticity of the story. Never the less, the movie is funny at times, if such a grisly topic as war on the Russian front could be funny. These men are the German version of the 'Dirty Dozen,' only the Wehrmact's penal units were mostly suicide units, with a much tougher row to hoe than American convicts ever had it. While not a 'Saving Private Ryan' war classic, the characters are quite unforgettable. Enjoy!",1440720000,5,907,4.469879518072289

2827954,4,B000PSPRV4,"Another enjoyable watch, if you've read Sven Hassels books then you might not think this movie quite measures up, but then what movie ever does measure up to its literary counterpart, despite that this is still a very good watch, laced with some good combat action and some extremely comical interactions amongst the main characters, lots of actors here in their younger days that you'll probably recognise from other work past and present, money well spent on this movie and glad to have it in the collection. Thanks Amazon",1436227200,9,524,4.898876404494382
2827955,2,B000PSPRV4,"Just a bad movie. I thought this would be good, I really did. Oliver Reed(blink and you miss him) David Carradine, just strutting around and Bruce Davison and the rest of the Misfit Nazi Brigade. We follow them attempting to protect their homeland, they hate the Nazis and disagree with Hitler and are all criminals in the eyes of Germany but.....have a job to do. The fact that they are anti-Nazi should work in their favor and endear them to the audience.....it doesn't, just grouchy thugs and not too believable at that. I was not interested at all and watched the whole thing....never see that 99 minutes of my life again. Oh, such a predictable ending. others seem to have disagreed with me so you can roll the dice.",1433980800,3,721,4.596899224806202

8193121,3,B000PSPRV4,"Sven Hassel's novels portray the dreadful conditions and wastage of men and materiel on the Russian Front. His novel characters in the 27 Penal Battalion do interact with each other humorously at times and they all share a common disdain for their commissioned officers.
To me, 'Wheels of Terror' came across as a comedy and a B movie. At first, I couldn't put my finger on it, but then realized it was like watching the Batman TV series from the '60's, except they didn't show words like ""Pow!"" ""Crack!"" ""Wham!"" ""Bam!"" during the action scenes.  But had they--it would have been Batman on the Russian Front.
The main characters are as bulletproof and exposed as James Bond in a firefight. The newcomers to the Unit get picked off. However, the movie does show what the Russian terrain is like. I fell into the common trap  (when watching a movie made from a novel) of comparing the movie to the book. This is not good; for the most part, one will be disappointed. I found the choice of background music inappropriate and annoying.

A Quick Overview:
Because the fellows are in a penal battalion, they are expendable, so are sent on a suicide mission behind enemy lines.  While en route and on foot, they encounter a Russian driving a German tank down the road. (The Russians have painted the Russian Star over the German Cross to re-identify the tank as now Russian) They handily sneak up behind the tank commander standing in the hatch, take the tank from him and continue their journey. At one point while resting and drinking (and wearing Russian uniforms), they are caught unawares by Russian soldiers crawling over their tank.  Our heroes open the hatch and hand the Russians cigarettes. Apparently nobody notices that our tank crew speaks Russian with a German accent. When the ruse is eventually discovered, they escape in a hail of bullets. (The entire movie is in English with English actors.)
They also encounter friendly Russians (male and female) and frolic together in a lake. And boys will be boys.
They successfully accomplish their mission and make it safely back to their lines, minus the newcomers.

The movie has plenty of action, but I think of it as a comedy, not a serious war movie.
If you keep all that in mind, you may enjoy the movie.",1509235200,,2261,4.711392405063291
