1368416,1,B00004XPPQ,"First of all let me say that I am a Dean Cain fan, I watched this movie based on the fact that he was in it.  That turned out to be a big mistake.  The plot has holes in it that you could Drive a Mack truck through, the action sequences were a joke (I'm sure the AFT enters a hostile situation single file like ducks in a row), and I don't think the writers know what the words character development mean.  I was so upset I was yelling at the television, but at the same time I couldn't turn it off.  It was like a train wreck, you have to look.
If you're looking for an action movie, run.  If you're looking for a Dean Cain fix get Best Men, Broken Hearts Club, or No Alibi;  otherwise you'll lose 2 hours of your life you'll never get back.",1010534400,6,742,3.946308724832215
1368417,4,B00004XPPQ,"I always browse the 'B' section of the movie store, looking for diamonds in the rough. I rarely find them, but this one was an exception.
Decent plot, good acting, interesting storyline, and some fascinating characters combine in this action movie to make it an enjoyable experience. Seeing old favorites like Stacy Keach and Jennifer Beals on the screen was a definite plus.",994464000,,375,4.968253968253968
1368418,4,B00004XPPQ,"I really had low expectations for this movie, so when I found myself actually being surprised about some of the twists in the plot, I figured Not Bad. Being a fan of mysteries, it was interesting the number of suspenseful turns this plot took. Some interesting alliances, and non-alliances, as people are working together or not. It seems all the characters are tense with each other over something. The plot isn't likely to take place today, post-Oklahoma City bombing, but the focus on the militia movement vs. military and goverment forces, and political arguments to boot, can have an open-minded person really thinking after-the-fact. Seeing these characters on-screen portraying their points-of-view, no matter what your beliefs, maybe the bad guys aren't such bad guys after all. As far as performances go, uniformly good, especially with quick intercuts and a fast-moving plot. An added plus is the obligatory hero-heroine romance is missing, though that's mainly because the characters are too busy working. The wardrobe seems off the rack rather than Georgio Armani, which may be less sophisticated but more true-to-life for guys and gals working on a salary. When the hero - an ATF agent - goes into his undercover op assignment, he even sports an unshaven look and trades steely glances and dialogue with a former militiaman - a man he once shot who is now functioning as his intro into the civilian army he is investigating. What's a definite problem is the DVD suffers from being full-screen instead of letterbox.",992390400,5,1527,5.087649402390438
1368419,1,B00004XPPQ,"This was a bad movie, the acting was horrible, the dialogue was laughable, and some of the action sequences were ridiculous! Especially that one scene where they blantantly ""borrow"" scenes from Terminator 2.  It's insane they use scenes straight from the movie, from when they tried to break into Cyberdyne systems. And they didn't even change that name they kept it, Cyberdyne systems. It was a very sad thing to see.",991008000,4,418,4.887323943661972
1368420,4,B00004XPPQ,"I'll have to disagree with the other reviewer. I think this only proves that Dean Cain can act. As a fan of Mr. Cain since his Superman days, I enjoyed seeing something different from him. And knowing what some of his other projects coming up are, it shows how versatile an actor he really is. All in all, Dean Cain is more than just a pretty face.",974764800,8,348,4.208955223880597
1368421,2,B00004XPPQ,"this movie was a little slow at points, however the chick more than makes up for the lack of action.  Shes pretty and hes used to be superman.  This movie about a meglomanic that tries to use the ""militia"" for his own gains. Former superman actor Dean Cain stars in this slow military drama, but his acting is what amuses me most.  If was interesting to see him act or the lack of it!",971827200,,384,4.162162162162162
7926170,5,B00004XPPQ,"I like that the picture is 16:9 and that is very important to me. The audio was not 5.1 surround sound but it was stereo and the Pro Logic surround decoder made it good. I liked the story very much and it was the kind of movie that I prefer to watch. I liked the action and violence. I like that there was quite an abundance of gun shooting. I like the punching, kicking and exploding. I like the helicopters. Some of the helicopters were shooting missiles. I found this movie with the search parameters that I set. Thanks again, Amazon Prime.",1517788800,,543,4.333333333333333
7926171,1,B00004XPPQ,Just bad. Bad acting. I wouldn't stand out in the open against attack helos and the ATF wouldn't be shooting from them. A B movie if you can even call it that. 3 stars? c'mon man!,1505347200,,179,4.0
7926172,1,B00004XPPQ,"Very bad with low budget. First ten minute unrealistic, almost comic book action. The second scene did it for me, the top secret lab is the Los Angeles Department of Water and power in the valley. Bad guy is creeping about cubicles until they start cutting in multiple shots from Terminator movie. Thats when I hit STOP",1503619200,2,319,4.614035087719298
7926173,3,B00004XPPQ,"As far as action goes, there's plenty of that but, the plot is a bit thin.
Dean is a good actor but this movie is not one of his best",1394496000,,133,3.466666666666667
7926174,5,B00004XPPQ,"Jennifer Beals did an excellent job in this movie, but again she needs to have more scenes in this movie.",1384992000,,105,4.3
7926175,5,B00004XPPQ,GREAT MOVIE.  SUSPENCFUL.  DEAN CANE IS GREAT AS AFT AGENT PARTNERED WITH JENNIFER BEALS AS JULIE SANDERS WHO ACTUALL FIRES A RIFLE.  STACEY KEACH IS GREAT IN HIS PART.  A GREAT GOOD GUY/BAD GUY SHOW WITH THE GOOD GUY'S WINNING IN THE END.  ALTHO THE GOVERNMENT DOES TAKE A FEW HITS.  JM,1212192000,,287,4.423076923076923
7926176,4,B00004XPPQ,"I liked this movie.  Good action, good story, Dean Cain and his gorgeous self.  Liked the banter between Dean and Jennifer Beal.  Cute interaction.  Lots of interesting twists in the story.  Recommend it.",1123027200,,204,5.0606060606060606
7926177,5,B00004XPPQ,"Without question, the best bad movie I've ever seen!  Every time I thought about watching something else, it got engrossingly worse.  I found myself feeling almost morbidly voyueristic as I watched the movie destroy itself in the slow, and painful, plot avalanche that was it's ending, to which I was superglued.",1066003200,,312,5.098039215686274
