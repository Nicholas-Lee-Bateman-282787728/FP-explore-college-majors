4514299,2,B0050ITT72,"As I die hard United fan, I've purchased every Season Review DVD since the 2006-2007 season when I started seriously following the team.  These DVDs are a hard core fan's delight: detailed coverage of every goal of every game throughout the season, interviews with the players regarding crucial points of the season, etc.

Unfortunately, this year's DVD is not up to the level of previous efforts.  Whereas most season reviews are two to two and half hours in length, this year's cut comes in at a paltry 90 minutes.  As a result, several of the games are treated in a short-handed fashion, which gives the entire production a very rushed feel.  Take United's first game against Chelsea in the CL quarterfinal.  Instead of a 3 minute reel of the full game with proper build up, we get a quick clip of Rooney's goal without the majestic play that made it possible.

Such shortcuts plague the entire effort: certain goals are shown from awkward camera angles (and only these angles) and we rarely get the audio from BBC/Sky commentators (almost as if the licensing cost to get them was a problem).

In sum, this DVD will be disappointing to those fans familiar with reviews from previous years and is probably suitable primary for the diehard fan wanting to complete his or her collection.",1310947200,3,1287,4.7657657657657655

4514301,1,B0050ITT72,"Being a lifelong ManU supporter, I have purchased many of their season reviews. This is the worst. The footage of the goals being scored shows the goals from so many different angles that they took the excitement of the moment out of the event. It is difficult to say what the producers were attempting, but the video footage makes it very frustrating to look at.",1309132800,6,363,4.6
4514302,1,B0050ITT72,"I am hugely disappointed by this dvd. The editing is infuriating, and for such an important season, and collectable dvd, this is a pathetic attempt. 2Entertain and Paul Doherty need to be brought back to figure this out.

Don't buy this dvd. Let's make them make another one, and we'll buy that",1309132800,6,294,4.653846153846154
4514303,1,B0050ITT72,"This cruel joke of a dvd is an insult to a historic, record breaking season, an insult to the fans and to the name of the club. Heads should roll at Man Utd's commercial division, MUTV and Bombo over this pos production. Words cannot describe how angry and upset I am. Bring back the previous producers 2Entertain and let them re-do it for the sake and dignity of Man Utd and its supporters.",1308960000,,391,4.36986301369863
4514304,1,B0050ITT72,"Of all the season review dvs's, this is by far the worst. This season review should have been a celebration of the 19th title, instead the producer has tried to show what he can do with editing. All the goals are filmed in strange angles and the commentary is from manutd.com

If I could give this 1/2 stars, I would.
DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!",1308873600,10,338,4.2
4514305,1,B0050ITT72,"I am a HUGE Man Utd fan... But I am very disappointed with this DVD. I own every season review since 1994, but this is by far the worst in terms of pure viewing enjoyment, and production of the DVD. Considering this is our record 19th League Title, you would think that we would have a decent DVD to look back at the season. Most irritating feature is that camera angles keep changing as a goal is about to be scored. It really spoils the viewing of the goals. Some classic games (West Ham away) are somehow edited into a few minutes, not doing justice to the match itself. I think they should re-make another season review and allow fans who bought this junk DVD to exchange them.

P.S I love Man Utd... But this DVD really sucks.....",1308700800,2,735,4.326086956521739
4514306,2,B0050ITT72,"I've been buying these reviews for as long as they've been doing them & always enjoyed them, more recently with my kids who love the whole 'season in a couple of hours' excitement these DVD's USUALLY give you.

This one is HORRIBLE though. It must have been edited by someone with A.D.D. I don't know if the ploy was to give us ""never seen before' camera angles but it just fails miserably as 95% of the time, just as the goalscorer is about to connect with the ball, Mr Editor decides to change angle, slow things down, spin things around, replay his favourite bit three times & you're left with a headache trying to follow the action & the excitement is sucked away in a mist of frustration.

I know there's perfectly watchable, crystal clear footage of every goal in every match featured here. They just don't use it.

***** for the team & the season

8451268,1,B0050ITT72,These season reviews are usually a highlight of the year for me as im not able to attend any games live. But this latest one is the biggest load of garbage.. So many great highlights we will never get to see properly. I am so disppointed and angry!!,1332892800,,249,4.208333333333333
8451269,1,B0050ITT72,"I was so excited to receive this dvd as a gift, but could not have been more disappointed once I started watching it. They change camera angles every couple of seconds, which makes it impossible to tell what it going on. There is no build up play showed, and all the commentary is from manutd.com rather than the actual game announcers. Very disappointing dvd, I didn't even want to finish it.",1325808000,,393,4.549295774647887
8451270,2,B0050ITT72,"For more or less the last 20 years, the United season reviews have been exactly what they should be: all the goals and highlights from the entire season with interesting vignettes about players and the context within the season. This year's DVD is woefully below the standard set by years of excellence with Paul Doherty International. A new company took over this year, and it's hard to imagine it being much worse. Not only are the vast majority of the goals shown from bizarre and ineffective camera angles, but coverage of some games is literally seconds long. The commentary is also plucked from MUTV instead of using the Sky commentary, which definitely takes it down another notch. Bring back the old style, and the fans will be happy again.",1324944000,,748,4.8062015503875966
8451271,4,B0050ITT72,"I think this is a great DVD, we watch it all the time and can't stop once we start. All the goals from the whole season, in order all the way through, Premier League, FA Cup and the Champions League. I still would recommend it for Manchester United  fans (or most any soccer fan) only thing i'd suggest is to make it longer.",1323993600,,324,4.142857142857143
8451272,5,B0050ITT72,"OK, I love Manchester United, I have many of their Season Reviews on VHS and DVD going back to the early 90's but I did not get this DVD when it came out because of the many crappy reviews I saw when I went to buy it. Eventually I did receive it for my birthday, so... putting it in I was expecting to see the horrific program the reviews had spelled out in such detail... filmed at strange angles, awful camera angles, couldn't afford cost of licensing commentators, bring back the old producers, edited by... etc.

To my amazement the program was awesome, totally love it, my kids love it and my friends love it. We've watched it dozens of times already. A season that was exciting up to the very end, a year that brought us Chicharito, our 19th league title (yes Nineteen mf!) and a spot in the champions league final. All presented in a great DVD that shows every goal from every game and fits right in with my collection of other great Man United DVDs.

Super happy with this DVD, sorry I listened to the nonsense reviews and had to wait to see it. That is a new low, sabotaging a DVD with clearly biased claims and some double secret hidden agenda. If you don't like United, just say it, if you do like United buy this DVD and enjoy it!",1321920000,2,1242,4.280851063829787
8451273,1,B0050ITT72,"I was quite excited when I heard this was coming to DVD so quickly, but boy does it show. It is cheaply made and the DVD menu itself is the first dead give away that this was made quickly. It reminds me of an amateur DVD. I think I could have made a better menu and DVD. The extras are terrible to be honest. This season saw the retirement of three legends (Van der Sar, Neville, and Scholes) and the DVD takes about 5 minutes a piece to explain their significance to the club. It is sad really because between the three of those fantastic players so much could have been done but the producers of this DVD went the fastest route possible and came up with the weakest possible composition. I have watched many season reviews and this one is surely not worth your time.  Sorry guys but this one sucked.",1314403200,2,801,4.269736842105263

8451275,3,B0050ITT72,"Compared with other season reviews of Manchester United, I expected a better product. I preferred to watch goals with one constant camera, not more cameras. It doesn't let  me feel the real joy of goals and highlights.",1312675200,3,218,4.891891891891892
8451276,1,B0050ITT72,"I read the reviews, but I still tried to go in with an open mind. But yeah absolutely awful, what makes it bad is the camera angles. Rather than showing the standard telecast goal followed by replays from varied angles, they show only angled replay shots and it really kills it and takes you out of it. If that isn't a deal killer to you than this is pretty much the same as with previous seasons. ( aside from that)",1312329600,2,416,4.2125
