5882843,4,B00E0KWB2G,"Danish director and screenwriter Tobias Lindholm delivers a taut thriller in an unusual and certainly non-Hollywood way.  Using a documentary style complete with hand held cameras, Lindholm captures the hijacking of Danish cargo ship MV Rozen and the subsequent negotiations between the pirates and the corporate CEO to get the crew released.

The Danes don't have the military might of America to come to their rescue so the give and take between pirate negotiator Omar (Abdihakin Asgar) and Peter (Soren Malling) create the primary focus.  But this isn't one of those quickly negotiated settlements.  It lasts 7 months.  Seven months of hell for the crew of the Rozen and their families.  The brutality of the pirates is mostly limited to psychological mistreatment, compounded by a lack of food, water and sanitation.  And Lindholm lays it all out there for the viewer to experience.

The captain of the ship becomes ill, so Lindholm centers in on the ship's cook, Mikkel (superb Pilou Asbaek).  His original upbeat persona gives way to deep depression as isolation and deteriorating conditions take their toll.  The film splits its time between being on the ship and being in the corporate boardroom.  Like most financial negotiations, it's just a matter of time as the two side each throw figures at each other that will eventually get the crew released.  Just what is the price for their freedom?

While the pirates are certainly seen as bad guys, they do have moments of humanity.  This is most evident when the crew persuades the pirates to allow them to fish off the side of the ship.  This brings in a nice catch which crew and captors both celebrate.  Alas, the pirate's soon resort to their jobs of intimidation.  This isn't an easy film to watch at times.  As I said, it plays like a real life documentary.",1384214400,4,1819,4.869706840390879

5882845,3,B00E0KWB2G,"The film is called "" A Hijacking"" because ""Boring Negotiations"" doesn't sell. The production has won numerous awards as the film is  billed as a psychological drama/thriller, easy on the thriller part. You don't get to see the actual hijacking, or for that matter any real action. The film moved from one boring talking scene to the next. Once the ship was hijacked, the parent company for some reason entered into long drawn out negotiations rather than simply allow the insurance company to make the payment and get the crew home as they typically do.

Sren Malling played the CEO who is torn between saving the crew and saving a dollar. This sets up as a metaphor for the worker's struggle against management. I would agree that the film was well done. However, for entertainment value, 3 stars is generous.

5882847,4,B00E0KWB2G,"I caught this movie just this weekend here in Cincinnati as a presentation of the non-profit Cincinnati World Cinema. So glad I did.

""A Hijacking"" (2012 release from Denmark; 103 min.) brings the story of the crew on a container ship which is on the Indian Ocean on its way to Mumbai, but gets hijacked by a group of Somali pirates. As the movie opens, we get to know Mikkel, the Danish cook on the ship, making a phone call to his wife and young daughter. We also get to know Peter, the CEO of the shipping company back in Denmark. We learn of the hijacking when Peter gets a note slipped in front of him during a meeting. Peter hires a consultant who has experience dealing with this particular situation. Meanwhile, back on the ship, the crew is not treated well by the pirates, and I'm being mild, as the days and weeks go by, while the translator for the pirates and the CEO are trading phone calls over the release money. The pirates are asking a ransom of $12 million and the CEO initially counters with $250,000. Will they come to a resolution? Will the crew make it back home safely? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is one tough and chilling, but ultimately riveting movie. The events in this movie are apparently a composite of real life events that have happened involving modern day sea piracy. Beware: this movie is not for the faint of heart.  The crew gets subjected to all kinds of physical and psychological abuse by the pirates. There are a number of scenes for which I simply closed my eyes, there is no ""Hollywood sugarcoating"" in this movie! Second, writer-director Tobias Lindholm, making his debut with this, shows a lot of promise with this strong movie. At one point in the movie, Mikkel, now weeks into the hijacking, finally gets to make a phone call to his wife (being pressured by the pirates to tell her to call the CEO and beg him to pay the ransom). As soon as Mikkel's wife hears his voice, she falls apart emotionally, and so do we the viewers, as this scene simply punches you in the gut. Here's hoping that this does NOT get a Hollywood remake, as happens so often with superior foreign movies. What would be the point of such a remake? The movie has been made already, and perfectly well at that. There is an upcoming release from Hollywood in October called ""Captain Phillips"" (starring Tom Hanks) with a similar theme, but from the trailer I've seen it's light years away from this movie as it's marketed as an action movie, which ""A Hijacking"" surely is not.

If you are in the mood for a top quality foreign movie that will have you on the edge of your seat, ""A Hijacking"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1374364800,26,2773,4.485148514851486

5882865,4,B00E0KWB2G,"Sadly, most people haven't heard of A Hijacking, and many who have read the synopsis and said this is just Captain Phillips with subtitles and decided to skip it altogether.  I have to admit, as much as Im an avid foreign film advocate, I almost skipped it for the very same reason.  Captain Phillips was still fresh in my mind and the idea of watching a film that appeared to be a very similar narrative had me uninterested.

Ive learned many times over to never judge a book by its cover, and here is yet another reason why that is just poor judgment.

First things first, this does carry a similar storyline as the aforementioned Oscar nominee.  Concerning a Danish cargo ship as opposed to an American one (and not being a true story, at least not in the direct sense), A Hijacking follows a different narrative than Captain Phillips did.  This really shouldnt be about which film was better, because they were both very different.  I will say that I appreciated Paul Greengrasss direction more, for despite having a film that was almost an hour longer than Lindholms, his film felt tighter and more focused (and only spanned a few days, whereas A Hijacking covers almost half a year).  While I did prefer Captain Phillips as a whole, they are different experiences altogether, and A Hijacking is not without its fair share of merit.

Splitting its time between the hijacked ship and the Copenhagen authorities, A Hijacking tries to cover a wider scope of circumstance than Captain Phillips did, which was content with staying on target and following its two stars from scene to scene.  Instead, we are given dire circumstances of the cargo ships quarters and the men trying to stay alive aboard as well as the stuffy and stress filled atmosphere inside buildings and office spaces as the higher ups attempt to resolve the issue without suffering too large a financial loss.  While the selfish business side of things was hinted at in Greengrasss film, it is exploited heavily here, and to devastating effect.

The cast really rises to the occasion and makes this film sink down in the themes presented.  At the forefront is Pilou Asbaek and Soren Malling who play the chief protagonists on their end of the spectrum.  Asbaek delivers a heart wrenching performance (such layers) as Mikkel, the chef aboard the hijacked ship who misses his wife and daughter.  Malling portrays the conflicted Ludvigsen who is desperate to get his men home but is torn between business advisors who don't want to play their hand too quickly.

For me, despite the brisk running time and shared vantage points, A Hijacking isn't as focused as I wanted it to be.  Maybe the juggling of multiple characters played against it slightly, but it is odd for me to feel that a film an hour longer and concerning a much shorting time span could be tighter and more streamlined than this one, but it is true.  Still, this is a harrowing look at the effects these situations have on those who endure them, and Asbaeks tremendous performance is hard to shake.  Just the way he allows the world around him to overtake him in those final frames (the gunshot, his stare, that ring, his eyes) is unforgettable.

For those on the fence about taking this one in, I strongly recommend that you do.",1394496000,,3261,4.7178130511463845

5882878,4,B00E0KWB2G,"Its an odd coincidence that two films about Somali pirates were released last year.  While all the public attention and critical praise has flowed towards the Tom Hanks vehicle, Captain Phillips, the Danish film, A Hijacking, is arguably much more of an artistic triumph.  If you were to watch these films back to back, it would be easy to see why Phillips has garnered so much attention: it is flashier, has bigger stars, and celebrates the triumph of American military force.  By contrast, A Hijacking is a much more subdued, but no less suspenseful, affair.  Where Captain Phillips is about ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, A Hijacking is about extraordinary circumstances fitted into ordinary business practices.

The narrative of A Hijacking is split between the men on the boat and the men from the boardroom. On the boat we mostly follow the ships cook who we are introduced to in the first scene as he tells his wife that he will be out to sea longer than expected and will miss his daughters birthday.  Although his name is listed as Mikkel, most people, even those trying to negotiate his release, mostly just refer to him as the cook.  While the cook and the crew strategize about how they might survive this ordeal, there aren't any last minute heroics.  At best, the cook and a colleague attempt to befriend a particularly unstable pirate with the hopes that this will make it less likely he will execute them; at worst, the cooks desperation to get home to his family is used as a bargaining tool by the Somali negotiator, Omar.

But the film is just as interested in how the Danish company who owns the boat handles the hijacking.  While the hijacking isn't an everyday occurrence, events like this are apparently common enough for the company to call in an expert in negotiating with Somali pirates.  The negotiation expert recommends that the company brings in one of his men to engage directly with the pirates, but the suit in charge, Peter, decides that he wants to handle the negotiations himself.  Early on we see Peter play hardball with several Japanese businessmen, so we know he is competent, and he is coached through the process by the negotiation expert, but the audience knows that Peters decision is part hubris.  In a sense, hes like a much more competent, much less coked up version of Ellis from Die Hard.

As explained early on, these negotiations can stretch on nearly interminably.  And the film does a good job of illustrating how time wears down all of those involved.  In this instance, the hostage negotiation lasts for months. And while early on Peter expertly deals with the pirates in the manner he has been coached, eventually the day in, day out pressure of the situation begins to erode his cool, Danish exterior.  It was also interesting to see the negotiation expert explain certain tactics.  For instance, Peter cannot immediately give in to the Somalis initial demands, not necessarily because it will be too costly, but because once the pirates know the company is willing to shell out some big bucks, they will find a way to draw out the negotiation longer and ask for more.

As the article A in the title suggests, this particular hijacking is often treated as the cost of doing business.  Its unusual, but not unexpected.  One of the more interesting characters in the film is Omar, who speaks English and negotiates on behalf of the Somali pirates, although he takes umbrage when Peter suggests that Omar is himself a pirate.  Throughout the negotiating process, both Omar and Peter attempt to maintain a cordial relationship, although it naturally breaks down over time.  Its easy to view this film as the clashing of two cultures within a global marketplace.  Theyre making a business deal, but it just so happens that one party has brought weapons to the negotiating table.

A Hijacking makes a fascinating comparison to the style of Paul Greengrass, the director of Captain Phillips.  Both films take on a cinema verite, documentary aesthetic.  But where Greengrass prefers to haphazardly throw his cameras about to mimic the intensity of the situation, A Hijacking director, Tobias Lindholm, uses his cameras in a manner similar to an actual documentary.  In other words, he uses handhelds, but he does not purposefully engage in frenetic jostling.  Greengrass uses the veneer of a documentary in order to reveal the subjective state of the characters in the film, but Lindholm seems interested in maintaining a calm distance from the procedures.  Arguably, this less frantic take provides the film with a more grounded feeling.

Beyond the individual narrative of Captain Philips, stories of Somali pirates are fascinating because they're examples of desperate people from a failed state using what seems like anachronistic tactics to force their way into streams of global capital.  Perhaps better than the Hollywood blockbuster version of this story, A Hijacking illustrates ways in which men are trapped within a world and economy they have no real control over.  Its eerie to hear Peter negotiate over numbers when mens lives are on the line.  Its an unsettling reminder that within this system the value of our lives can be reduced to a number written on a marker board in a conference room.",1391299200,,5282,4.917700112739571

5882880,4,B00E0KWB2G,"Based on real-life events, Tobias Lindholm's drama focuses on the consequences of a hijacking of a Danish cargo ship bound for India by Somali pirates.  What sets it apart from other hijacking films is its focus on the delicate negotiations between the pirates, their mediator Omar (Abdihakin Asgar), and Peter Ludvigsen, the CEO of the cargo ship company (Soren Malling) back in Copenhagen.  We understand the delicate bargaining process; how the pirates are quite prepared to sit it out until they achieve what they want, and how it is imperative that Peter should keep control of his emotions.  To do otherwise would be to cede the advantage to the pirates.  In several sequences of unbearable tension in the situation room in Copenhagen, we watch Peter being advised by hijacking specialist Connor Julian (Gary Skjoldmose Porter), while struggling to maintain his calm.  Meanwhile, back on the cargo ship, director Lindholm shows how the hijacking affects the crew, especially ship's cook Mikkel Hartmann (Pilou Asbk).  Eventually he almost cracks up under the strain, as he is shown cowering in a corner, unable to move or speak.  Even when he is finally restored to his family, he can hardly raise a smile.  THE HIJACKING is an intense film: Lindholm's camera focuses relentlessly on the characters' facial expressions.  A gesture, or even a blink of an eye, denotes a change of emotion.  The performances are uniformly excellent - especially Malling, who is shown at the end getting into his car and driving off.  This is something he might do on any normal day, but this time he walks in silence, staring blankly into space; not exactly ruined, but profoundly scarred by the experience.",1390608000,,1694,5.03584229390681

5882882,5,B00E0KWB2G,"Quick, precise, and severe, the film spends little time on the mechanics of how the pirates actually board. This is not an action film. We learn that a high-speed boat has approached and boarded effortlessly, thats it. More important to the film is what happens while the pirates are onboard.

The first thing the pirates do, even before starting negotiations for money, is demand food. The ships cook, played brilliantly by Danish actor Pilou Asbaek, becomes the pirates gopher, and an ad-hoc negotiator between the pirates and the ships owners.

Conditions onboard are miserable. Shocking even. The cook and 2 other crewmen are kept in a small closet for weeks, four other crewmembers below deck. Theyre not allowed out to relive themselves in a toilet; they must use a corner of the room. My training on ships did not include images like these. There was no training about how to interact with maniacs with automatic weapons.

The job of casting the actors that play the pirates is ingenious. All the actors performances are in the Somali language (I think). Their interactions with the ships crew are so authentic that Im guessing none of these men were trained actors. Probably just local Somali men recruited by the casting director, but I cant verify this. If they were actors, they're the best Ive ever seen.

Contentious negotiations between the ships owners and the pirates leave questions. The hijacking ends without incident, almost, but the negotiations take months. Could the ships owner have done more? Given in to the pirates demands sooner? Gotten the crew home faster? Undoubtedly questions that need to be asked of the real hijackings that take place routinely in the Gulf, where we get little more than a single paragraph in the news about some, and no more.

Errata: There is no military presence here. It seems unlikely that a cargo ship would be held hostage for months without attracting some kind of military presence. The fact that the all the negotiations themselves are handled by the shipping company, and are not handed over to the military entirely seems implausable, especially when compared to the Greengrass version where the military handles everything.

5882884,4,B00E0KWB2G,"The Danish film industry seems poised to take over Hollywood's movie-making mantel, as they've been making a lot of the kind of film that it is no longer profitable for Hollywood to make. ""A Hijacking"" (""Kapringen"") is the latest of a handful of solid Danish dramas that I've seen in the past couple of years. It follows the plights, and deteriorating mental states, of two men touched by the hijacking of a cargo ship. The Danish ship the MV Rozen, en route to Mumbai, is hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean. The ship's cook Mikkel (Pilou Asbk) is particularly harassed by the pirates, as they always want to be fed. In Denmark, the shipping company's CEO Peter (Sren Malling) has the weight of the world on his shoulders as he attempts an interminable negotiation with the pirates though their intermediary and translator Omar (Abdihakin Asgar).

Tobias Lindholm both wrote and directed ""A Hijacking"". The ship's scenes were genuinely filmed on a ship, for which the audience is grateful once we get out of the cramped quarters to which the hostages have been confined. I was pretty glad to see the sea and sunshine too. Mikkel interacts primarily with his captors and with the Captain (Keith Pearson), who has taken ill, and the friendly Chief Engineer (Roland Mller). It's a good performance, but Mikkel's arc seems contrived in the end, which I think is the film's only flaw. It's Peter the CEO who got my sympathy. He is an expert negotiator who feels he can function in that role better than anyone so ignores the advice of a specialist to use an outside negotiator. In doing so, he places himself in an impossible predicament, waiting constantly for a phone call, only to refuse the pirates' demands and wait...repeatedly.

The DVD (Magnolia 2013): There is a trailer and a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette (15 min) in five parts. Director Tobias Lindholm comments while on location, as do the actors. The most interesting part concerns the real story that inspired the film: the hijacking by pirates of a Danish cargo vessel belonging to The Clipper Group in 2008. Their CEO Per Gullestrop, who looks a bit like Peter in the movie, is interviewed. He was apparently on the set at times and an advisor on the film. A member of that crew that was hijacked, Chief Engineer Juma Mvita, who has a small role in the film, is also interviewed. The film is in Danish with optional English subtitles.

8599798,4,B00E0KWB2G,"I had enjoyed watching director Tobias Lindholm's other film, 'The Hunt' , making me want to check out this one.  I wasn't disappointed as this film turned out to be quite a gripping human drama,  with an unexpected ending. The film is primarily in Danish with sub titles.

The story revolves around the hijacking of a Danish cargo ship - the MV Rozen - on the high seas of the Indian Ocean by Somali pirates and the ensuing negotiations between the management of the shipping company in Copenhagen and the pirates. The pirates have a hired Somali negotiator who speaks English and he makes contact with Copenhagen over the satellite phone. The shipping company hires Connor, a professional consultant to advise on how to negotiate with  the pirates. Connor suggests that the actual negotiation itself must be done by an outsider instead of the CEO of the company because the CEO is likely to be emotionally involved and hence may not do a dispassionate job. But Peter, the CEO, declines the advice and insists that he will lead the negotiations himself because it is his ship and the hostages are his employees. Much of the film is about the tortuous negotiations which drag on initially for days, then weeks and then months. What is fascinating is the trajectory of the negotiations and its effect on the nerves of the Somali negotiator, the hostages and Peter. The Somalis start with an initial demand of $15 million to which Peter responds with an absurd sum of a quarter million dollars. We see Connor advising Peter towards slowly increasing the amount in response to each reduced offer of the pirates. Meanwhile, the crew on board the ship gets restive and turn increasingly angry and despondent as they see that their company was not paying up the price asked by the pirates. Even though they gradually strike up a more amiable relationship with the pirates under the prolonged captivity, they realize that their lives can be snuffed out in a second by the gun-toting hijackers if they are not paid the sum they would settle for. The film ends with a twist that is at once shocking but not exactly unexpected either.

Most of us ordinary film-goers have little idea of what happens in real-life negotiations between hijackers and the representatives of the hostages. In the film, we can see that there is an undercurrent of a rather callous attitude towards the lives of the hostages by both the pirates as well as the bosses of the shipping company and its team of advisors. Ultimately, what they are haggling about is setting a price on the head of the seven hostages. It seems of secondary importance as to how long it takes to arrive at that price or its effect on the fragile psyche of the hostages. When governments say that they will never negotiate with hijackers, do they imply that they care about the lives of the hostages only as secondary to the more political goals? Watching this film, one feels that this is what the captured hostages might think.

Though it is a Danish film, a lot of the action takes place in English, interspersed with conversations in Somali which are not sub-titled, and some in Danish between the hostages  and the CEO. In spite of the act of hijacking, there is little violence on screen by way of brutality and spilling blood. Even the hijacking is presented only as a fait-accompli. The pace of the film is crisp leading to a climax that stays in our mind. The director brings out the human drama and the mental turmoil experienced by Peter, the hostages and their families very well without giving in to melodrama.

An excellent film well worth its time.",1453161600,2,3605,4.720190779014309
8599799,4,B00E0KWB2G,"This is a good movie.  It's tense.  The story is based on the real hijacking of a Danish ship by Somali pirates.  Three actors from the Danish hit, ""Borgen,"" star in the movie.",1441670400,,176,4.2727272727272725
8599800,5,B00E0KWB2G,"Umm..Yes, it has subtitles as it is a Danish movie.  Umm...Yes, it relies on outstanding acting, plot development, and psychological suspense as opposed to a relentlessly loud soundtrack, explosions, and special effects.  So, for the 90% of Americans who can't go 30 seconds without checking their FB account, and have lost the ability to read and write effectively, this excellent film is not for you.",1439251200,,402,5.1692307692307695
8599801,2,B00E0KWB2G,"This movie IS NOT in ENGLISH.  Only portions of it are in English...if you do not relish having to read the captions to understand what is going on.  Reading the description given(see copied and pasted at end of this review)  I thought the movie would be in English with foreign languages in captions--This is NOT the case.  I am disappointed.  Do not recommend.
