7946611,5,B00005N9FK,"Ken Russell's movie, ""A Song of Summer,"" takes its name of the first major work (after completing Cynara) that Delius and his amanuensis, Eric Fenby, undertook together. Based on Fenby's book, ""Delius As I Knew Him,"" the film covers the time from when Fenby first offered to come and help the blind and paralyzed Delius by writing down his music by dictation to the Death of Delius 6 years later. With allowances for dramatic and cinematic license, the film generally stays true to Fenby's book. Delius emerges from the book, and movie, as a true monster of self-absorption, a harsh critic of British music, Christianity, and holding fast to the view that only his art, not love, should matter to a composer--and yet, paradoxically, his music is breathtakingly beautiful. How Mrs. Delius, who cared for him unwaveringly through all of his horrific physical decline, endured all of this is remarkable, but it was, ironically, her love for him that sustained her in her caring for her invalid genius.

Having met and discussed Delius with Fenby in 1978 I learned one more fact that is not in the book or in the movie--Fenby said that Delius was more of a father to him than his own father ever was. This is remarkable coming from a man who's gentle spirit was so damaged by Delius that he had a nervous breakdown after working with him. And yet, there was love in his voice when he described Delius.

For anyone who is a Delius fan, or devotee, this film is a treasure. There are some beautiful excerpts of his music in the film, and Max Adrian plays Delius so convincingly that at times I forgot it was only acting.",1368316800,,1614,4.63986013986014
7946612,5,B00005N9FK,"And its not so very short so it's a very strong contender for the greatest British film. Yes I know it's up against Michael Powell, and Carol Reed and Lean's Great Expectations and Oliver Twist but they do all seem a bit dated now and this doesn't, nor will it. Moreover against Powell and Reid it has the advantage of the subject matter.
Of course it's always been a heresy in the aesthetics of modern art to give weight to the subject matter, but I don't care. I resent having to waste admiration on some brilliant treatment of distasteful, trivial, marginal, or soon just part of history, subject matter. And to hell with film history. Lets just take the subject matter seriously into account for once as well as the treatment - because, don't misunderstand me, the treatment here is every bit in the 'arthouse' style. Russell could do it when he wanted to.
To tell the truth the only reason I don't make the outright claim for this being the best British film (despite it being made for television on a small budget in case you didn't know) is that I make that claim for Russell's 'The Music Lovers' a film on the same sort of subject but in an entirely different style. Whereas this is naturalistic the Tchaikovsky film is expressionistic and stylised in a way not very far removed from Powell's work.
This is of course a film about a great composer and his music, and for that reason, as the music combines with the lyrical/naturalistic texture of the film itself, there is more than usual reason to return to it for further viewings.
Best watched on a CRT television in the 4:3 format. It's worth keeping an old TV around for gems like this.",1348272000,3,1648,4.533557046979865
7946613,5,B00005N9FK,"My first meeting of Delius works is The LP(ASD3139) of the EMI Co. sale of
The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Conducted By Sir Charles Groves.
There was ""A Song of summer"" there.
This is a long-awaited video for me.
This is a very beautiful film in monochrome.
This is an episode of the assistant application of Delius who lost the freedom of eyesight and limbs for the sickness in later years and a young musical person Eric Fenby.
Fenby was not able to write perhaps, and a moving situation is projected symbolically as an image though it is cruel
(Though ""Delius AS I Knew Him"" is a base).
""North Country Sketches"" is shown in the intro part and ""The Walk to the Paradise Garden"" is shown  in the climax effectively here in the process from which ""A Song of summer"" is created.
Young person Fenby might have been disappointed at man of Delius's reality.
However, he felt Delius's music character it respected and it was the greatest worth.
Therefore, I think that it was possible that he follows to the last minute.",1271376000,,1016,4.613259668508287

7946615,5,B00005N9FK,"I would really like to get this film for USA format. I can't understand why all of Ken Russel's films are not more available.
I saw this film many years ago on Public TV and fell in love with Delius's music. This is also one of Ken Russel's best earlier works. Way befor he went over the top.(Has anyone seen The Fall of the LOUSE of Usher?)
This is a beautiful film about a very complex man and his visions.
It would be a great addation to anyones Ken Russel collection.",1212192000,,471,4.186813186813187
