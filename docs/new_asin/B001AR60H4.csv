3465805,5,B001AR60H4,"This is a great movie for my just-turned two year old.  She absolutely loves it and we adults enjoy it too.  For fans of sesame street, it's wonderful to see how the different characters of that show are morphed into the different characters of Alice in Wonderland.

This is the first video that I have ever seen that can keep a group of 5 year olds MESMERIZED for the entire program! This production is very educational as well as entertaining! Highly recommended!",1226188800,2,381,7.8604651162790695

I imagine though, that it would be better seen at home than in the theater.  In the theater, it was way too loud, and with all the previews, the movie seemed very short.",1224374400,,301,3.9833333333333334
3465810,4,B001AR60H4,"This is the first time I've seen the Abby character in the Sesame Street programs and she sure is cute!  She has a darling voice which the little ones seem to find fascinating. Sesame Street always does a great job with their DVD's and they're a favorite here.  It's nice that this one is a little longer at 40 minutes than the typical 30 minutes which seems to fly by.

The voices are cute, the movie is colorful with lots of activity and the story which is a take off on Alice in Wonderland with Abby taking the part of Alice is a good one.  The Sesame Street cast takes the other parts, like the Cheshire Cookie Cat or Bert and Ernie as Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.

About the only thing I would change and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it isn't a ""Fast Play"" or auto start DVD.  You have to wait for the menu to come up and click on play.  It's nice to have movies which start over on their own like the Sesame Street Sleepytime Songs and Stories.  But all in all, I'd say this is a good addition to the collection.",1222732800,22,1041,4.093596059113301

3465832,5,B001AR60H4,"Super cute Sesame Street re-telling of Alice in Wonderland starring Abby Cadabby! Follow Abby down the rabbit hole as she chases the Red Rabbit (Elmo) to find her magic wand! My kids loved watching the Milk and Cookie help Abby find words that rhyme with ""drink"" so that she could shrink, and ""eat"" so she could grow bigger! We loved the Mad Hatter song and Abby's song about wanting her own fairy tale. And the Count and Rosita counting blades of grass in English and Spanish is too cute! Lots of songs/counting/rhyming fun for your little one! Also starring Cookie Monster as the Cheshire Cookie Cat, Grover as the Mad Hatter, Count von Count as The Count-erpillar and Oscar as the Grouch of Hearts!",1460505600,,701,4.661290322580645

3465918,5,B001AR60H4,"This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Masterpiece-Edition/dp/B0000TG9E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)</a>) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.

Review of this 2008 production of Alice in Wonderland . . . (yes. Sesame Street counts!)
It's been a long time since I've seen Sesame Street and I was not familiar with the newer addition to the cast known as Abby Cadabby. Abby Cadabby? With a magic wand that she uses to ""poof"" herself away? Tooooo cute!! Abby is played by voice actress Leslie Carrara-Rudolph, who was 43 when the character was introduced in 2006. Her voice so well mates with little Abby.

Abby's adorable, and this takeoff on Alice in Wonderland is adorable as well. Naturally with kids shows such as this (as with Alice takeoffs on The Muppets, Hello Kitty, Care Bears, Barney, et. al.) you don't spend a lot of time asking how close they stuck to the book(s). You just go along for the ride, and if the kids love it it's a winner. And if the adults happen to love it too, so much the better.

This adult really loved it. Abby is just sort of astonished as she wanders around Wonderland. The plot device is that she wants to get home, but she loses her magic wand and can't poof here way back until the person who has it, unfortunately the King, who wants to keep it, surrenders it back to her. In the meantime she has her little encounters with the Wonderland characters. The caterpillar scene is great, and they added a comic touch by having Tweedledee and Tweedledum show up just to announce they don't rally belong there. LOL!

ps - Most of the reviews here refer to very very young children enjoying this Abby in Wonderland, but still I would like to recommend some other Alice in Wonderland takeoffs that young persons in general may like (but not necessarily the 3 and under crowd). First there is of course the AIW done by The Muppet's and starring Brooke Shields (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Muppet-Show-Vol-8-Diana-Ross-Brooke-Shields-Rudolf-Nureyev/dp/B0001BS3H0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Muppet Show: Vol. 8 (Diana Ross / Brooke Shields / Rudolf Nureyev)</a>). There is also an Alice takeoff down by Hello Kitty that is great fun (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hello-Kitty-Friends-Vol-3-Timeless-Tales/dp/B00029NMJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hello Kitty & Friends, Vol. 3: Timeless Tales</a>). And there are a couple of cartoon version that I like because they stick closer to the books than other animated attempts (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Nutech-Digital/dp/B00003CWIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Nutech Digital)</a>) and (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland-Jetlag-Productions/dp/B00006RCMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland (Jetlag Productions)</a>).

Our 3 year old was 2.5 when she received it, and she still loves it.  Certainly hasn't gotten tired of it yet, and she watches it at least once a week.

It's a good length, a little over half an hour, enough for me to get something done but short enough for her to not get bored. The music is pretty good, and several scenes are pretty humorous. There's not really any classic sesame street teaching moments, a short thing about the letter T is it. My daughter is an Abby fan because of this video, which is okay with me. It's not nearly as annoying as Dora, and not as superficial as princess movies. Of course I'd rather her not even know what TV is at this age, but this video is the only thing she'll sit for and not destroy something while I get laundry or dishes done.

In short: Watchable by adult standards, AWESOME by toddler standards.",1301443200,,749,4.3120567375886525

3465943,4,B001AR60H4,"This is a cute DVD. While it's only about 40 mins long, I find this the perfect length for a 2 year old. Basically, the story follows the Alice in Wonderland story with Abby as alice, Elmo as the white Rabbit, Oscar as the King of Hearts, Count as the ""Counterpillar"", Cookie Monster as the Cheshire Cat and Grover as the Mad Hatter.

I think the person who reviewed this DVD as ""boring"" was probably expecting a Disney Pixar production or something. This DVD (I wouldn't even call it a ""movie"" really) is similar to Sesame Street - some scenes are about rhyming, some about counting and some about letters. But it all flows within the plot of Alice in Wonderland. But no, it's not a huge budget blockbuster like Toy Story or something. Any kid who loves Sesame Street or Abby will really like it.

The only thing that confused my 2 year old is that Elmo looks REALLY different as the rabbit and i had to explain to her many times that elmo was the bunny (she loves Elmo and was disappointed he disappeared quite quickly).

So, if your kid loves Elmo or Abby or Sesame Street in general, buy it. But if your kid is not so into Sesame Street and prefers proper feature length films like Toy Story, give it a miss.

We love it.",1286582400,,1225,4.336244541484716

3465945,2,B001AR60H4,"Based on the reviews, I rushed out and purchased this DVD for my daughter. The DVD is boring and tedious. It seems to be more of a showcase of the varous transformations that Sesame Street characters undergo in Wonderland, than a fun story and music. Abby is a cute character, but Elmo is much more interesting in the theme DVDs.",1284595200,,329,4.5

3465947,4,B001AR60H4,"My two year old daughter loves the Abby character. She looks forward to the Abby's Flying Fairy School segment on Sesame Street every day. Being she's not as popular as Elmo, I didn't think Abby would have been given her own video. I found this one and my daughter loves it! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is it's a pretty short video for the price(around 40 minutes.)",1275177600,,381,4.380281690140845
3465948,5,B001AR60H4,My 18 month old loves Sesame Street so I knew this would be right up her alley.  She loves all the songs and it does a good job of keeping her interest.  She doesn't make it all the way through the DVD but will watch about 20 minutes before moving on to something else.  I'm sure the older she gets the more of the movie she will watch.  It's a very cute DVD and I would definitely buy as a gift for other Sesame Street fans.,1264982400,2,425,3.9069767441860463

8279070,5,B001AR60H4,"My daughter loved this show and now my son loves it even more. What's nice is that it's the fun characters and some catchy songs, but it's in a short little show. Some of the compilation shows are way too long (advertising 3+ hours) and keep the kids in front of the tv too long. Sometimes parents may want that :P , but sometimes it's nice to reward the kids with a short show that you won't have an issue turning off. I wasn't sure how much buying this would be worth since it is just a short show, but their love for it has made it worth it.",1497571200,,544,4.0
