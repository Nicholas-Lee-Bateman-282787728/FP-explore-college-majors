2005614,1,B0001IN0N0,"The cover of this DVD shows Tarzan standing with a lion.  The movie with Gordon Scott that featured that scene wasn't even one of the five movies.  This is definitely not what it is portrayed as being.  I was looking for Gordon Scott movies (in color), but these were black and white movies that featured several other ""Tarzans"".  Only one had Gordon Scott in it, and it was not the movie that was pictured on the cover of the DVD.  This was a birthday gift for someone who has been looking for Gordon Scott Tarzan movies for years, and I thought I had finally found the ""perfect"" gift.....not so.",1264982400,2,597,4.440366972477064
2005615,2,B0001IN0N0,"Even though I am 55 years old all the ""Offically Great"" Tarzan movies were made before I was born. Yes I do own this set that I picked up for about 3 or 4 bucks at a discount joint just for the Elmo Lincoln 1918 ""Tarzan of the Apes"". The rest of these are nothing more then fill-ins of a number of off-beats that played the Big T over the years. In my youth Tarzan movies were always on TV, mostly on Sundays. In those days only one person was recognized as the real Tarzan...OK class lets say it togeather...""Johnny Weismuller."" I have both the MGM and the RKO DVD sets. As many know Johnny played Tarzan from 1932 to 1948 (after that he busted on the scene as ""Jungle Jim"")...and yes he was the best. The MGM efforts are outstanding.""Tarzan and his Mate"" was and still is the finest Tarzan movie ever made and well worth seeing, many parts of the movie were shot on location in Africa and taken from another MGM classic ""Trader Horn"". In 1939 I could never understand how a movie like ""Gone with the Wind"" could win the years' Academy Award over a movie like ""Tarzan Finds A Son"" one of the real Weismuller classics. Talking about classics ""Tarzan's New York Adventure"" broke the box offices but also ended the years of MGM doing any more Tarzan movies as WWII was about to break out and Maureen O'Sullivin (The only real Jane)went back to England to be with her husband before he entered the was against Hitler!
If you want the best Tarzan movies then the MGM set is what you should get, not this sorry set. Some trivia... how many knew that it was Johnny Eck the half boy from the movie ""Freaks"" who had no legs and therefore walked on his hands that played the prehistoric freaky bird seen walking in the jungle in the Weismuller classic ""Tarzan Escapes.""

2005616,5,B0001IN0N0,"As another reviewer pointed out, there are several sets of Tarzan DVD's available.  Unfortunately, many share the same movies.

The Johnny Weismuller set, (The Tarzan Collection Starring Johnny Weissmuller), with six movies on 4 discs contains the best movies.  The DVD picture and sound quality are good for movies that are over 60 years old.

The purpose of my review is to compare this set, (Tarzan 5 movies on 2 Discs), with a comparable set, (Tarzan:  King of the Jungle).  Both sets contain the following movies and actors:

""Tarzan and the Trappers"" - Gordon Scott

""Tarzan the Fearless"" - Buster Crabbe

""Tarzan's Revenge"" - Glenn Morris

""Tarzan and the Green Goddess"" - Bruce Bennett

This set contains ""Tarzan of the Apes"" - Elmo Lincoln

The other set (Tarzan:  King of the Jungle) contains a second Bruce Bennett movie, ""The New Adventures of Tarzan,""  in lieu of the Elmo Lincoln movie.

The difference in costs between the two sets as of the date of this review is over $15.  This set, (Tarzan 5 Movies on 2 Discs), is priced under $10.  The other set, (Tarzan: King of the Jungle) is priced over $25.

If price is a concern, this set offers the better value.",1151712000,17,1174,4.699507389162561
2005617,2,B0001IN0N0,"When I ordered this set, there was no information except Gordon Scott so I ordered.  There are several Tarzan sets, but be careful because they all seem to have the same movies.

If you just want good Tarzan movies, get the Johnny Weissmuller ones.  I already had all the Weissmuller and Lex Barker Tarzans so ordered this because it said 5 movies and Gordon Scott.  Actually, it is Tarzan vol 1 and Tarzan vol 2 in one package.  I already had Tarzan vol 2 so now I have duplicates.

Volume 1:

Tarzan of the Apes--Elmo Lincoln

Elmo was the first movie Tarzan and this is a silent movie so obviously old.

Tarzan and the Green Goddess--Bruce Bennett

A gentleman Tarzan in---Guatemala?  Need I say more?

Tarzan and the Trappers--Gordon Scott

Not the best Gordon Scott but at least a sample if you don't have any of his movies.

Volume 2:

Tarzan the Fearless--Buster Crabbe

Tarzan's Revenge--Glenn Morris

These 2 movies are not Johnny Weissmuller quality and very old but watchable. They do give you a different look if you collect.

The main reason I wrote this review is so you would know which movies are in the set. I know I don't like to order blindly. They are not expensive so worth it if you collect Tarzans. Otherwise, get Johnny Weissmuller.",1129680000,94,1256,4.606334841628959

8013125,2,B0001IN0N0,It was ok. It wasn't what I expected. I thought I ordered something different. I like Gordon Scott as Tarzan so I kept what I ordered.,1395878400,,134,4.1923076923076925
8013126,5,B0001IN0N0,Being a Tarzan fan has been great.  I was glad to hear that Cheeta was 76 years old in 2006.  I'm wondering if he's still alive.  I always enjoyed Tarzan because of his strength and swimming ability.  I was some what of an athlete in High School and now I love to travel and enjoy the outdoors.,1377129600,,294,4.105263157894737

8013128,1,B0001IN0N0,I don't like it at all it is an embarrassment to Tarzan and he can't yell and he's too civilized for Tarzan.  If you like Tarzan movies don't choose this one,1351641600,,157,4.064516129032258
8013129,3,B0001IN0N0,This was not what I expected.  I expected 5 Gordon Scott Tarzan movies.  Only one of the movies starred Gordon Scott.  I did enjoy the other 4 movies even though they were not in the best shape having some white patches and streaks throughout the films.,1292371200,2,253,4.456521739130435
