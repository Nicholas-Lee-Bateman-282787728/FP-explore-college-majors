2962852,5,B000W6ZUUC,this show is clearly addictive and i kno that i am not the only one to think so...it is what everyone and i really do mean everyone talks about. it is cool because i went to an all girls school and live in the city so i understand the drama and basically live off of it. i just show the season finale and don't know what to do with myself until it comes on again next year! i also can't wait till august,1211155200,3,403,3.8674698795180724
2962853,4,B000W6ZUUC,"I have been religiously reading the book series ever since it first came out, so when I heard about the TV show, I had extremely high expectations, and must say I was not at all happy with the first episode. I could not believe the way that they had completely changed the look of some of the main characters. So for a while I stopped watching the show, but my curiousity got the best of me, and after it came back after having been on hiatus for a while, I resumed watching it, and I admit, I was hooked.

Although many things are completely different than the book series, the show still has that provacative, addictive edge that will keep you coming back for more.

Now, if you are a fan of the books, such as myself, yet have never seen the show before, I feel this are some things I must warn you about.

First of all, many of the storylines that happen on the show, never happened in the book. I won't go into detail about any of the plots though, because I don't want to give anything away.
I was a bit angry about everything being so different at first, but then after having thought about it rationally for a while, I realize that this is after all a TV show, and if they went exactly by the book, chapter for chapter, then the show certainly wouldn't have enough plots to last for more than one season!

Second of all, (the thing that disappointed me most) the characters of Dan, Rufus, Jenny, and Vanessa look extremely different on the show, than the way that they are described in the book. Drastically different, in fact. And in the books, Serena has a hot older brother, yet on the show, he turns into her younger brother.

But they did get a few of the characters right.

The extremely sexy Chace Crawford makes THE perfect Nate Archibald...in fact he may even be more delicious on the show than the way they describe him in the book! The only flaw that he has is that in the book he is a chronic stoner, but not on the show, although that's really no big deal.

The lovely Leighton Meester makes a wonderful Blair, actually coming very close to the way I had imagined her to be in the book, and the same goes for the beautiful Blake Lively, who plays the role of Serena.

And then we come to Ed Westwick, who plays the role of Chuck Bass. I am extremely impressed. He makes the perfect Chuck, from the way he looks, right down to his personality.

So yes, ill admit I started off being very critical, but now I consider myself a fan of the show, and am eagerly awaiting for it to come out on DVD, as well as for the new season to begin.

If your a fan of the books, who started out skeptically as I did, then I feel that you should give the show a chance. You might find that you actually enjoy it!",1211155200,31,2715,4.223938223938224
2962854,3,B000W6ZUUC,"Let me start off by saying, I am a huge fan of the books.

The pilot to me was a complete let down.  I really did not like it.  I didn't like the castings, the acting, a lot of the story lines.  So, I didn't watch it for about 5 more episodes.

The episodes until the writer's strike didn't have me hooked, but I did have some fun with them, and my family enjoyed them.

The episodes in April and May, the last third of the season, were a step up.  The characters became more interesting and the plot lines became way better.  Georgina, played by Michelle Trachtenberg, brought the needed spice.

So, I can conclude that the series is getting better over time, and I have some pretty big expectations for next season.

It's not a perfect show, it has it's bland moments, but it is a guilty pleasure.  If you're looking for substance or subtle humor, this isn't it.  If you want some mindless fun, check it out.",1211068800,9,910,4.288235294117647
2962855,5,B000W6ZUUC,"This show is great and what is best is that it stays true somewhat to the books, but is different enough to not be dull to those of us who have loved the books. Lots of changes in the characters. Those who read the books, you know Jenny is different, dan and Vanessa are different as well. It is awesome and I wonder if Baby Yale will ever be on the show.",1210118400,3,355,3.9444444444444446
2962856,5,B000W6ZUUC,"This is now my favourite show. I live in New Zealand and we don't yet have it on TV. Hopefully we will soon. But I watch it over the internet and it is soooooooooo awesome. Normally I wouldn't be bothered to do this but I love this show so much that I don't care about the hassles. While some scenes may be suggestive, I don't think that there is anything more explicit on this programme than anything else on American TV. I find the drama captivating, and the similarities to a typical teenager's life (in any country) is great.  Although some stuff I can only guess if it happens in Schools in the USA. BOTTOM LINE. I think this show is brilliant. I would let my ten year old watch this show as I honestly don't believe that there is anything worse on this show than others.",1209340800,4,776,4.27891156462585
2962857,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I'll start by saying that I'm 31yo, female, married with kids :)  I've always been fond of teenager drama; something I never really outgrew.  I've found this show's storylines interesting and entertaining, enjoying both the stories of the teenagers and their parents.

The show's greatest perk imo is in the costuming.  Each character in each scene is wearing an eye catching, or in some way riveting outfit, including the men.  Accessories are used beautifully.  The actors themselves of course provide their own eye candy.

A WORD OF CAUTION TO PARENTS however.  In the seven episodes I've watched so far there has been a great deal of alcohol imbibing by the teenagers, including a 14yo.  It is implied that one of the teenagers habitually uses a drug, pot if I remember correctly, which is discussed as trivial in light of a parent's cocaine use.  One of the teenager characters is occasionally seen sleeping with women paid by his father.

From the first episode it is clear that almost all of the teenage characters are sexually active or plotting to be.  In the seventh episode, a parent gives advice on ambience for his son's planned night of virginity loss in his bedroom on a night the rest of the family will all be out of the house.

Bottom line - A lovely guilty pleasure for adults who enjoy the genre but off limits to minors whose parents are hoping to instill morals in their children and teenagers.",1207612800,15,1416,4.7306122448979595
2962858,4,B000W6ZUUC,"This is the ultimate guilty pleasure show. The characters are shallow at best, yet somehow you find yourself completely sucked in to the totally unbelievable soap opera they live in, complete with whimsical names, parents that don't care, and more money than most bank tellers see in a year.

The show starts out about Serena (played by Blake Lively) a good girl with a bad past, yet somewhere after the first few episodes Blair (Leighton Meester's character) Serena's best friend/enemy, starts to completely outshine Serena with her complicated love life, parent troubles, and glossed over eating disorder.

My only complaint is that (I imagine due to the writers strike) the season finale completely sagged. Hopefully (if there is a...) next season, it will pick back up again.

Worth watching, though I couldn't exactly tell you why. It's a complete guilty pleasure, and somehow, no matter how ridiculous the plots may seem, it always keeps you coming back for more.",1201737600,24,969,5.081761006289308
2962859,4,B000W6ZUUC,"So far I've had some really mixed reactions to GOSSIP GIRL.  First and foremost, who gives a frak about the social elite?  Well, I guess someone out there does, but as a group I find them a tedious lot at best, at least in fictional settings.  I suppose I shouldn't have said ""foremost,"" because another reason I have sometimes disliked the show is the way that Josh Schwartz shows (well, at least THE O.C.) tend to introduce extraordinarily unlikable characters that the show persists in keeping right in your face.  In this one we have two inconceivable unpleasant characters, Blair's boyfriend, who has all the personality of a manikin, and his buddy the serial rapist.  My suspicion has always been that Josh Schwartz doesn't understand the difference between characters that we love to hate and characters that we merely hate.

So why did this episode appeal to me so much?  Easy.  Neither Manikin Boy nor Serial Rapist Boy are in the episode for even a second.  Instead, the episode focuses mainly on Serena and Dan's first official date and Dan's sister Jenny's experiences at a Blair sleepover where they all play Truth or Dare.

Unfortunately, Manikin Boy and Serial Rapist Boy aren't dead and will tragically reappear, dragging the show down every second in which they appear.  My hope is that Schwartz and Co. will have learned from THE O.C. and its string of tediously unlikable characters (from Oliver to the end); my fear is that they haven't.",1193097600,,1457,4.834677419354839

2962893,5,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl season 1 is  about 6 teenagers named Serena Van der Woodsen  (Blake Lively), Blair Waldorf  (Leighton Meester), Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) who lives in New York on the Upper East Side.  Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) and Jenny  Humphrey (Taylor Momsen) are brother and sister who lives in Brooklyn with their divorced dad named  Rufus Humphrey (Matthew Settle).  The student to a prep school one for boys called St. Jude and the girls go to Constance Billard.  Everyone in the school loves looking at Gossip Girl which is a blog. Gossip Girl is like Facebook.

The show begins with Serena returns to the Upper East Side from boarding school.  Blair has been dating Nate Archibald since kindergarten.  At a wedding the year before the show started Serena and Nate had sex.  The night that Nate and Blair were planning on having a special night Nate told Blair about  the night the wedding. Serena and Dan starts dating.  Blair and Nate break up.  Chuck and Blair start dating and Chuck tells Blair he likes her.  Chuck and Nate are best friends. There a lot of fun things to watch in season 1.  Watch the show.

In 2007 when the show started I watched about 10 to 15 minutes of the plot and was not interested in it. My best friend, Angela told me about the show, she told me to try the show again.

I love the bridging during the series of the elite world with the ""normal"".  Watching all the drama behind that and the character development of each main character was great. The series starts out a little on the nave (younger side) but it grows into a pretty powerful show by the end.

2962925,4,B000W6ZUUC,"The pilot (very first episode) of Gossip Girl is one of the best I've ever seen.  The debut season is pretty strong overall too.  It's a character driven dramedy about the lives of Manhattan's elite full of twists and turns.  The main character is Serena VanderWoodsen, played by Blake Lively who's just returned from boarding school and is harboring several dark secrets, but the real character to watch is Blair Waldorf, Serena's snobby ice queen best frenemy,expertly played by Leighton Meester.  If the rest of the series had stayed this good, the show could've went down as one of the best teen dramas of all time, but alas, after this season the show turns into a soap operady (soap/comedy) about the incorrigible character, Chuck Bass, played by Ed Westwick, and his on/off again abusive relationship with Blair.  The story lines become repetitive and insipid and all of the other characters either get pushed aside or destroyed to prop up Chuck Bass.  Don't waste your time or your money on the other seasons.

2962929,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I am a 50 year old male, Give or take a year or two :) and I actually Love this show. I Live in the Gold Coast in Chicago  on North LSD ( NO NOT the DRUG,the Road, Lake Shore Drive) so i know what it`s like to be AROUND the filthy rich! I am NOT one of them although i wish i was :) Anyhow.... they got alot of this show right in my opinion and picked perfect cast members.
 MOST of The Filthy Rich in Chicago (Not all) are not as Uppity as New yorks Rich are but i am sure the people here ""Get it"" anyhow. I mean I get it and I am not rich by anyones definition.

The Writers, Characters, the back and forth Banter and basically everything in this show is good. When it`s suppose to be funny it`s very funny. When its suppose to be sad it`s exactly that and so on. It also gives us a look into what it`s like to have all that money and be able to do whatever you want whenever you want but also to know that NO amount of money can get you out of certain Troubles.

That said, My favorite part besides the Characters/Actors is that the show lets you see how ""Human"" you are whether you are Rich (Chuck) or not (Rufus,Dan and ""J"") I think they do a very good job getting emotions out of the actors. I mean lets face it... Alot of these Actors know exactly what it is like to be rich so they come into this with a general idea anyhow.

Well.. thats it. I wanted to give it 1 star, I thought about giving it 4 stars but honestly i had to give it 5. I like it that much.",1357257600,3,1466,3.8410596026490067

2962931,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Season 1 of Gossip Girl begins our journey into Manhattan's elite and scandalous Upper East Side. We encounter sex, lies, secrets, and schemes at every turn. We're introduced to characters so deliciously shrewd, we don't know whether to root for them or hope for their inevitable demise. Yet they are well written characters nevertheless; layered with hidden agendas and sympathetic backstories.

These prominent characters who will shape the rest of the series are..

Dan -- an outsider from the wrong side of the tracks thrust into the elite world of the UES.
Chuck -- a cold and callous womanizer, who at first glance, appears to show no semblance of a soul or conscience.
Serena -- a reformed party girl eager to change her rebellious ways.
Blair -- conniving and ruthless in all her endeavors, yet consistently driven to succeed.
Jenny - the social climber, desperate to enter this elite world at any and all costs.
Nate -- the quintessential brooding pretty boy, burdened by his family's own shady misgivings.

These are characters who you may occasionally loathe, but will inevitably grow to care about.

What makes these characters redeemable? Their backstories. The show propels us into their world. We peer into their home lives. We discover where they come from, who they are, and what provokes their choices and actions. The character's families become an integral part of the series as well. The drama isn't solely centered on the teenage characters. The characters' parents find themselves oddly connected to the drama in their kids' lives as well. As we venture into their lavished Upper East Side world, we are transported into high society; extravagant parties and luxurious fashion. We're exposed to a world that is both enticing and addictive to viewers. The scandals that the characters wrap themselves in are complex and provocative. And the viewer becomes addicted to these scandals; each one more outrageous than the last. The writers never disappoint, as they keep the scandalous plot twists coming at every corner.

The first season of Gossip Girl belongs in an elite group of its own...as it re-defines the teen drama genre by blending the sophistication of 5th Avenue with a hint of raunchy abrasiveness. While it may lack in depth and realism, one can still appreciate Season 1 of Gossip Girl for what it is -- an addictive guilty pleasure that will keep you coming back for more.",1356134400,,2408,5.01

2962952,5,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl is a teen/adult show with an excellent cast, AMAZING wardrobe, and juicy plots. An anonymous woman reports on the lives of upper class New Yorkers and people who associate with them, and this is how we penetrate into the lives of Serena, Blair, Nate, Chuck, Dan, Jenny, and eventually Vanessa.

The show is very similar to other popular teen shows these days, in the sense that the characters deal with issues with drugs, sex, and family conflicts. What I especially like about this series, though, is that they have pretty witty one-liners and complicated plots in which different characters' situations intertwine.

If you're watching Season 4 currently on the CW, but you missed out on one or more of the earlier seasons, you might be a little lost when it comes to what's going on. Thus, I would highly recommend you start watching with Season 1 and work your way up. Even in the new season, the characters make references to events that happened in the first season, and you're not going to know what exactly that was unless you watch it for yourself.

Also, it's a really great idea to buy it here on Amazon, as opposed to elsewhere. Believe me, this is the cheapest price you'll find for a new DVD set.",1290470400,,1221,4.643518518518518

2962962,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I have to admit I never watched this show from the beginning - but after purchasing the complete first season, I have fallen in love with the show. As an avid OC fan I didn't know whether this show would embody the same complexities as the OC often did with characters whom are multifaceted -

Then I met Chuck bass I can honestly say I have never been immersed in a character as much as I have been with him - his ability to remain with a contained and measured controlled exterior his stylized attention to detail and his charisma and vulnerability juxtaposes with his devilish plots and turns is truly captivating - he is an amazing talent truly a find his blend of heartbreak and heartbreaker and tragedy makes him a powerful lead actor, although the show is pitched through its protagonist Dan his entrance to the upper east side, it is Chuck journey most captivating he is an outsider detached at times from the social fabric of society in many ways he epitomizes a figure who at times can be the conscious on the show - he is the one all the characters turn to for help and he always delivers. His complex love affair with Blair the quintessential upper east sider her properness and her insurgence for titles and the trimmings of lady love, makes this character intriguing her character brings out his vulnerability and his fear of not being able to be loved or whether he can even love at times makes for a heartbreaking watch - It is his triumphant in the dhow we are most interested in - his escapism through drugs and meaningless flings with women make him even more complex he numbs his pain- the other characters just do not compare .

Blair played by Leighton Meester is excellent she gives a performance of a modern day Scarlett in Gone with the wind, She loves Chuck Bass but he is not conventional and neither she is - this a heartbreaking tale of two powerful lovers coming together - Dan is a moralist but selfish he lacks the depth of chuck and his love with Serena appears superficial he does not love her for who she is - Nate is the rich pretty by who is lost in a world he has no belonging he is even more tragic because despite efforts he never does anything worth any value - his friendship with Chuck is his only saving grace because he truly cares for him. I feel sorry for Vanessa her attempt to be the sidekick of Dan seems contrived =it just doesn't serve a great purpose - I do however think she has the repertoire to be a great actress but the script does allow her to pursue her talent - she becomes submerged in quick wit lines with now weight and end up making her seem annoying. Serena the all American girl - the cheerleader type I like her as she is consistent but she does not have the convoluted mixture both Blair and Chuck have.

I have watched the whole of this complete season and I loved every moment of it - the unraveling of the brilliant Chuck and his love with Blair is compelling - Ed West wick is a amazing actor his true brilliance to capture very scene and demand with his powerful presence is what transports Gossip Girl from a mild and Luke warm tale of upper side rich spoilt teenagers to a highly quality show which actually delves beneath the exterior the show has truly exhibited excellence in the casting of Ed West wick without him literally the show would hold neither value.

I know, that seems like the most logical way of collecting all these fabulous and limited release coins. But I chose to go about it another way, and I have to admit it's really been an adventure doing so. I decided when these neat ""little"" coins (actually the quarter is the biggest of the commonly minted US coins)( It goes dime, penny, nickel, quarter)(no you're not crazy the dime is just slightly smaller then the penny even though it is worth TEN TIMES MORE!!!) started being released that I would go about a different route then what all those fancy smancy TV ads were offering. ( You know the ones for those glossy state maps with coin slots for each state and a new coin sent to you each time it was released?)( Convenient though! ;) ) I decided to make my own map ( And I did!) (It's not as glossy, but WHO CARES!!) (Because I had fun doing it and I got to learn the placement of the states better!!!) And here is what I consider the most adventurous part (and the most nail bitting! ;) )  I just waited! (WHAT?!) (LOL, i'll explain) Every time a new US State Quarter was released I simply  just waited for it to come along.

(sometimes my friends had their quarters before me!!!!!!!!)( a lot of the time actually :P)(Oh well, I had more fun! =P) Lesson Learned?: Don't be afraid to try doing things a little differently then others, you might discover a whole new world out there that you never imagined was there!",1241568000,,1904,4.228021978021978

So when the first season came out on DVD, I immediately bought it. The first night I watched the first 2 episodes and liked it, but was not completely raving about the show. The more episodes I watched- the more I got into the show, though. Honestly, the episode where blair and chuck are at the burlesque club (around ep 6 or 7) that is where I begin to really like the show. To me Blair, is an absolutely wonderful character- she is conniving, mean, mischevious, sweet, and funny. Blair is a complex character- and really makes the show for me. I like all of the ensemble, I also like the ""frenemy"" apsect to Serena and Blair.

This show is my guilty pleasure. It is a fast talking, pop-culture dropping show. Plus the fact that they take advantage of NYC's scenic atmosphere doesn't hurt. This is not a deep thinking show, but it is campy fun. It's the kind of show that you can just sit and watch and enjoy.",1233187200,3,1086,4.297560975609756

The actors and actresses on this show are extremely talented and the plot line never fails to please. The wardrobe another added bonus - its awesome!",1232150400,,468,4.650602409638554
2962999,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I kept putting this show off because it just didn't do a thing for me within the first ten minutes of the first episode. None of the actors seemed to have the WOW factor to keep me glued. Here we are almost a year later and the show has arrived on DVD. Me being the bargain shopper that I am, I decided to finally pick this up on DVD solely based on the fact that it was under seventeen dollars. Considering there's only eighteen episodes making each episode a little less than one dollar (Total Bargain). Needless to say, I was bored last night and needed something to watch and this flipped the bill perfectly. I finally gave this show a chance and it was worth it.
Yes, the acting is bad and even on some levels hideous by some of the actors - amateurish acting at its best. Even veteran actors like Matthew Settle and Kelly Rutherford don't really deliver the goods either. It's true what they say - You have to work with what you're given and these actors aren't given the best lines. Nor do I believe that the director of each episodes pushes to get the best of them. But under the cheap exterior of a soap opera with actors in their twenties playing teens, lies a decent show.
The lead actress Blake Lively looks like she is in her thirties during the first few seconds of the show on her train ride into Grand Central Station and pretty much in every episode as well. It bothers me that she doesn't look seventeen, but I can handle it.
The show reminds me a lot of Cruel Intentions for some strange reason. If Manchester Prep School was made into a show, this would be that show.
I feel helpless because the show is almost done with its second season and I am only on episode three of season one.
The show revolves around Serena, the so-called IT GIRL who has disappeared for boarding school only a few months in only to make a surprise return into the city. Her old posse are all in shock when she returns and after much negative influence from Blair is axed from their inner circle. Though the narrator, Kristen Bell, keeps harping on the fact that it revolves around the lives of the rich and privileged in the Upper East Side of Manhattan - this couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth. I adore that the show is shot in Manhattan, but it's rarely on the UES. Many of the scenes are shot around Midtown and under. The Palace Hotel where Serena stays during the first season is in the fifties on Madison Ave. And the UES is not even all that. Everyone that lives in Manhattan knows how untrendy the UES is. It's just a playground for married couples who have children and want to pay overprice fees to send them to private schools instead of public schools.
Leighton Meester (Blair Waldorf) is just a bad actress. So is the young sister (Jenny Humphrey) played by Taylor Momsen. She is beyond atrocious in the acting department. If speaking like a valley girl means acting than I must have that act down pat. But, Ed Westwick (Chuck Bass) was born to play his role. Everything about his overall presence fits the part of the snotty angry rich kid that causes nothing but trouble. He wreaks havoc perfectly.
Overall there is promise for this show. It's packed with beautiful people (for the most part) and the basic premise is an interesting spin. It's like watching celebrities live their lives after they read their own gossip that swirls the headlines and the fury ensues.
Though this show is much like most teen soaps, lacking real talent and most of its stars just don't have the x-factor - its still deliciously devilish fun in the vein of Melrose Place. Kristen Bell narrates this show annoyingly yet fittingly with that darn teen condescending voice of hers. If you need something on TV to keep you entertained since Sex and the City went south after season three, this is the show for you. You know you love it XOXO!

Based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar, this CW show is narrated by the mysterious title character. Not really so mysteries as it is that of the recogniziable voice of Kritsen Bell, who was both seen and heard on three seasons of ""Veronica Mars"". This first season of ""Gossip Girl"" begins with the return of Serena van der Woodsen (played by Blake Lively of ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" movies.) The question of why Serena left in the first place is not answered until near the end of the season. Each of the 18 episodes contained in this DVD set are satisfying viewing because each one of them is a well written, well acted, well done piece of storytelling.",1227484800,,761,4.521739130434782

It probably wouldn't appeal to much to the older crowd (at least over 35) and it may have too much inappropriate content for younger than say, 13. Its a great show over all though.

It deals with some real teenage issues- coke snorting, and date rape, at the extreme. It's not for young viewers, or even young adult viewers really. It's definitely an adult show.

2963024,5,B000W6ZUUC,"Remember the episode of ""Seinfeld"" where Jerry claimed to have never seen an episode of ""Melrose Place"". And then under a lie detector test confessed his addiction to it? That's how I feel about Gossip Girl. I read a few articles about it but never saw an episode until its first season finale. I taped it and then all the reruns of the first season (sorry, no DVR yet!). Then I spent Labor Day weekend watching all of them in order. This is a supremely addicting show that only got better as season 1 rolled on and its characters' storylines played out.

Gossip Girl is like an east coast version of ""90120"" or ""The O.C."" and follows the spoiled rich kids of New York's upper west side, who live in a world of elite schools, designer clothes, limos and endless excesses. And whose reputations can be made or broken by a few lines in a mysterious website called Gossip Girl. The purveyor of this site is never seen, only heard in voice-overs by Kristen Bell. The series centers on Serena van der Woodson and her return (from parts unknown) to New York, and her reconnecting with her often catty classmate Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meissner) and her denizens at their elite private school. Blair's feelings for another classmate, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), have been jeopardized when she has an ill-fated tryst in a limo. Nate tries to keep himself together as his family slowly implodes and his unrequited love for Blair is tested by the fallout from her limo indiscretion with Chuck Bass. Serena also attempts to reconcile with longtime boyfriend Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgeley), whose younger sister Jenny has fallen under the spell of Blair's clique. With unforeseen and potentially dangerous consequences. Dan still carries a torch for Manhattan's Serena, but must try to balance his feelings with that for old Brooklyn friend Vanessa. And as with any show of this kind, there must be an element of danger. In this case, it's from bad boy Chuck Bass, who cruelly blackmails Blair with details of their limo tryst. Bass becomes even more loathsome for Serena when he becomes her stepbrother. Serena's life gets even more complex when a destructive nemesis from her past (Michelle Trachtenberg of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") shows up and fatally disrupts the new life she's been building since her return to New York.  The end result of this storyline is surprising, as they all band together to ""take down the bitch"" as Chuck so eloquently puts it. But that ""take down"" comes at the cost of Dan & Serena's relationship. But Nate's life starts to look up when he finds a new ally in Serena in the season 1 finale.

I've neglected to mention the actress playing Serena, because I must single her out. She's played by Blake Lively (""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" films). She is truly one of the most beautiful actresses working today and was made for a part like this. She can play a vulnerable and strong character with ease. I really believe great things are in store for this beauty.

And the show is just,AWSOME,don't think it will last very long but I still enjoy it and maybe will till it ends (in a good way and circompstences I hope...).
For those who think it's crap,just don't watch it,cause normally when you don't like something you don't even bother giving it intentions,or maybe you don't have a life for doing such things,which is sad for you...

2963029,4,B000W6ZUUC,"I wanted to watch this because of the books I read some years back and saw some of it while in America.  I got immediately hooked and actually enjoy the show (while though not my absolute favourite).  I love to watch the clothes and the scenes of New York, but the one thing I hate the most is the acting.  I love Dan except to me, he's the worst actor in here (and the hottest).
The show features rich snobby kids in NY, and a brother and sister 'from the wrong side of the tracks' (the poor side) who all go to the same school and the drama's that ensue are because of text messages all the school kids get from Gossip Girl (who we don't know).  It has b*tchiness and s*x and drugs and alcohol and everything in between in it - all the things that make this show addictive (to watch).
If you're looking for Emmy nomination material, you won't find it here (not for acting anyway - maybe for costumes), but this is light fluffy trash that is meant to be a teenage soap opera brought to you by the O.C creators (which by the way was a much better show).  It's fun to watch and so I definately recommend it if you love a little escapism at the end of a long work day.",1221264000,5,1166,4.0964912280701755

2963033,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Hello. My name is Laurie. I'm 22 years-old. And I am...addicted to Gossip Girl. There. I said it.

I had read the Gossip Girl books back when they first came out. And I liked them. I never did end up finishing the series. So when I heard they were creating a TV show based on the books I was mildly interested. But I actually didn't end up watching it due to my own gripes with the CW network.

But I ended up catching the end of an episode posted on youtube (Victor Victrola) and was instantly intrigued. So I watched the previous episodes online. It moved a little slow at first, but it soon picked up. And by the time the next episode aired on TV, I was hooked!

Let me just say that this show is NOT anymore scandalous/provocative  than other TV shows! That's all hype that the CW lets build in order to create buzz around the show. So all these parental boards freaking out need to chill. You're kids have probably already seen worse- hate to break it to you.

Yeah the show can be silly and dramatized. That's half the fun! And its nice to escape my boring everyday life for an hour and get caught up in it! In my opinion, it blows the novels right out of the water!

Another thing I like about the show is the cast. They always seem to be down to earth and cool in real life, and I think they do a great job with the material they're given. Its VERY easy for some of the story lines to become cheesy and redundant (given its technically a TEEN drama), but they always seem to pull it off and make it seem believable.

My only con of the DVDs is that there is no cast commentary of an episode. I think that would have been a good feature to have! The bloopers, however, are pretty hilarious.

There's a reason there's so much buzz about the show with young and older audiences alike. And that is because it truly is an addicting show. And every week you find yourself more buried in it than the week before. Its a vicious cycle really...

I definitely recommend it. Season 2 starts September 1st on the CW and I've never been so happy to see summer end! I know its gonna be good.

You know you love it.",1219622400,5,2108,4.182716049382716
2963034,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I heart this show so much. It's complex and well written...and pretty. The clothes are amazing and it goes by quickly because they never stay too long on any character. I don't think it's meant to be very deep but I'm guessing you'll be surprised how much these ""shallow"" characters actually get to grow on you. At times, I felt they were taking my heart out and squeezing it. It may seem like just a teen show...but it's actually very entertaining. Don't expect to learn anything, but that's the fun. It's sparkly and sexy, and may just rot your brain...but completely worth it!

I feel like if I ever met Ed or Chace, I may not be able to control myself. Watch and you'll see what I mean.",1219449600,3,690,4.390625
2963035,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Finally, a teen drama which scores with its take and spin on the absurd and stupid genre. Everyone knows that this style of drama is far fetched, highly unbelievable, and utterly pathetic when placed in such serious contexts with moral issues. But Josh Schwartz,  the creator of Gossip Girl, is turning the show into a ""close sister"" to his original work: The OC. And his work is the complete opposite of portraying ridiculous incidents for teenagers and their disfunctional parents to take part in such serious manners. Gossip Girl takes a refreshing approach to the teen drama genre with humor, heartfelt moments, self parodies, and not trying to make everything so serious with attempted ""landmarks."" It is because of these traits, that keeps Gossip Girl so interesting and enjoyable to watch. Its viewers know that teen dramas are stupid, its creators know that the genre is stupid, and so they all have fun making it stupid and fun to watch. Nothing more is needed. Making such a genre serious raises the absurdity of a such a show to extreme levels and enjoyment is lost. Josh Schwartz has learned this with his previous work. The OC fans know that ratings on the show tanked during the second and third season due to the attempts for serious writing and loosing the humorous parody of the teen drama. Now if only Schwartz and his team keep that factor in mind and don't do the same thing for the second and third year of Gossip Girl, this series will continue to be a delightful viewing pleasure with great fun. Keep Gossip Girl funny, its what made The OC so unique and successful, and its lack of existence is what makes Gossip Girl's competition (and once The OC's competition): One Tree Hill SUCK!",1219363200,8,1708,4.731543624161074
2963036,4,B000W6ZUUC,"I had high hopes for this series. It not only came from the creators of my favorite show, The OC, but it was based on my favorite book series. I was disappointed when looking through the episode guide to see how few episodes Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage actually wrote. Many of the story lines and character relationships seemed very similar to those of The OC. You can see how every character on GG is really modeled after one on the OC. With all these similarities I wanted a little more quick dialogue and ironic plots. As far as comparing to the books, they basically changed everything. It's not a bad show, it's extremely entertaining, but if you're looking for a direct portal into the books or a way to sooth the pain of The OC's cancellation, keep on looking.",1219190400,3,774,4.535714285714286
2963037,1,B000W6ZUUC,"The purpose of this show seems to be to convince young girls that woman should rip each other apart, backstab, and have a complete lack of morals.

This is a very real show.  Yes some of it is over the top but for the most part, its real.  Fights, pregnancy scares, boy probles, friend problems.  It was nice to see a show deal with all of this plus do it while being well written.  I would say it was my favorite show if Prison Break and One Tree Hill weren't on the air.

PS.  Check out the books.  They are amazing!",1218499200,3,532,3.9339622641509435
2963039,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I was truly apprehensive about this show; thinking it was a mindless teen show like the strings of teen shows the CW seemed to bring out lately. But I was very surprised. The season really became interesting, to me, once Chuck became a semi-leading character. Him and Blair really do make the show racy and interesting. They did a pretty good job for a season 1. Nate's character is a bit cardboard and I think the writers realized this early on and put him in the back-burner. Serena and Dan are a constant wave of emotions as are Lily/Rufus.

If you're having a hard time getting past the first few episodes try to make it to Episode 7; that one is just majestic and so very well done that you'll be hooked from then on. If you're into drama (most of the time mindless) you will enjoy this show filled with pretty people with problems. It works great after a stressful day at work!",1218153600,5,883,4.384146341463414
2963040,3,B000W6ZUUC,I have enjoyed watching Gossip Girl season 1; however I feel that the series has lost something that was present in the books.

2963041,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl takes place in New York City, which is what got this New Yorker into it in the first place. It's location attracted my friends, many of whom reside uptown like the characters. However, after a viewing of the pilot I saw a lot more than just some of my favorite Manhattan landmarks. With a cast of fresh faces and entertaining characters, the show has a lot to offer. Starting with Blake Lively, she plays bad girl gone bad Serena.

Returning from a trip out of town with the intensions of turning things around she starts a relationship with the token indie boy from Brooklyn. New Yorkers will laugh at the idea his being from Williamsburg is being from the other side of the tracks, due to the insane rents there. Dan played by Penn Badgley, is likable and delivers his witty one liners in a way of that of Seth Cohen. While likeable apart, the two of them together are the most boring couple of prime time. Which is disappointing due to the fact that they are the central focus of the season.

Serena's best friend Blair Warldorf is deliciously bitchy as the reigning Queen of the Upper East Side. Although Blake is the breakout star, Leighton Meister who plays Blair is the most talented actress of the bunch and not to mention the fact that she is the most entertaining character. Aside from her ups and downs as Queen B, she also dapples in love affairs with golden boy Nate, and bad boy Chuck.

Nate played by Chace Crawford in an empty eyed performance, is a wasted character who never really has too much going on. However, his best friend and the third member of the love triangle, Chuck Bass played by Ed Westwick is another amazing element of the show. His stylized, plotting man bitch is the only character who is on par with Blair. But the true star of the show is Kristen Bell as the title character and anonymous blogger. Her voice is just bitchy enough yet also warm enough to deliver the cold truth but not be too cold to care. For me anyway, she was the driving force in my love of the show, from the moment she introduces herself and telling you her identity is ""the one secret she'll never tell"", you find yourself as addicted to her and her blog as it's many readers.

But character developments were never Josh's problem, the problem was keeping them going. And, after watching the dizzying first season of the OC where more happened in seven episodes than in seven seasons of 90210 I feared that Gossip Girl would move too fast and ruin good plot lines. However, they seemed to have learned their lessons. The 18 episodes contained here, move at a great pace that allow you to enjoy the story lines yet them turning into something before they get tired of them. The only question is if they can keep it up for many more seasons, the problem with high school television dramas is that high school can only go on for so long.",1215388800,4,2858,4.469348659003831

2963047,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I don't think I can sum up this show in such few words...
- Best location ever (show is shot ON SITE in New York City). It is the most popular show in NYC for a reason!
- Hottest cast on television
- Two of the best actors to hit CW (Leighton Meester who plays Blair Waldorf and Ed Westwick who plays Chuck (was listed as one of the ""Most Underrated Actors of 2007')
- While OC had great Indie Music, Gossip Girl also has great music that is more ""mainstream""

This show was by far the most buzzed about show in 2007-2008 (heck..the most talked about show in the last 10 YEARS!!) and for good reason! If you open ANY magazine, any blog site, Gossip Girl is mentioned at least five times!

It is addictive, the storylines are fascinating, and the show is WELL WRITTEN and witty (one of the very few teen shows that is loved by many critics!).

I was drawn in to Gossip Girl because of Josh Schwartz and his work with the OC and because it was based on a book. True, Gossip Girl is different than the book but its a GREAT CHANGE. Personally, I never loved the books as much as I love the series.

However, like many Gossip Girl fans, I became OBSESSED with Gossip Girl the minute Chuck/Blair happened. This type of couple has NEVER been shown on television ever. Their chemistry is amazing, the banter, bite, and the acting by these two costar far exceeds any of the other actors on the show. Not suprising, that in a span of a few days they became  the most talked about couple. This couple is so popular they these two have been the cause for major ratings increases for various GG episodes...CW knows this couple=$$ and ratings and this is why Chuck/Blair will most likely become the main focus of season 2 which was previously held by Dan/Serena(starts on Monday September 1st at 8PM on the CW)!

If you are not sure about Gossip Girl, watch to episode 7 (Victor/Victorla) and I guarantee you won't be you won't be able to stop. The only downside of this show is that it is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!

True, Gossip Girl will never reach the critical acclaim of Battlestar Galactica and Friday night lights..but is BY FAR exceeded my expecations to become my FAVOURITE SHOW ON TELEVISION!",1211673600,25,2180,4.4214463840399
2963048,5,B000W6ZUUC,"GOSSIP GIRL could well be the first and last hit show developed by the CW in the wake of the merger of the WB and UPN.  With multiple industry sources indicating that the network is in serious trouble and may cease operation following the 2008-2009 season, GOSSIP GIRL could well find itself at a new network in the 2009-2010 season, assuming that it maintains its ""buzz"" well into its sophomore season.  But if the CW is able to reverse its current difficulties, GOSSIP GIRL could well be the reason it survives.

For a while in this past season, GOSSIP GIRL and DIRTY SEXY MONEY were fighting it out for title of top new Guilty Pleasure Show.  It was neck and neck at the break for the writers' strike, but with DIRTY SEXY ending its season prematurely, GOSSIP GIRL roared past it in the second half of the season.

GOSSIP GIRL was one of two shows created by Josh Schwartz that debuted in the fall of 2007.  The other was CHUCK.  Both shows were heavily indebted to Schwartz's previous big hit show, THE O.C.  It was as if he separated out the cool nerd elements of THE O.C. and distilled them into CHUCK (the lead role of which is reputed to originally have been offered to Adam Brody, Seth on THE O.C., though Rachel Bilson, who played Seth's girlfriend Summer, did guest on CHUCK) while the social politics of the idle rich were distilled into GOSSIP GIRL, though transposed to the East Coast.  The result was two thoroughly likable shows, though also two very different shows.  Which one prefers will depend exclusively on personal taste.

THE O.C. was seriously marred in each of its first three seasons by the introduction of a series of thoroughly despicable and evil characters, emblemized by the infamous and desperately hated Oliver from Season One.  My guess has always been that Schwartz and his co-creators never sufficiently distinguished between characters we love to hate and characters we merely hate.  Season Three of THE O.C. largely led to the show's demise with a long string of horrid and evil guest characters, even though the abbreviated Season Four was one of the series' best.  So far GOSSIP GIRL has done a splendid job of avoiding this pitfall.  The most prominent evil character so far has been Georgina, played by BUFFY's Michelle Trachtenberg (though Dawn has definitely grown up), and unlike Oliver was an utter delight.  So perhaps they've finally gotten this down.

My lone problem with the show has been the focus on the children of New York City's social elite, a group of human beings I could not possibly have less interest in (well, perhaps I find them more interesting than the history of wood lice in Iceland).  This is largely redeemed by a good-looking and talented group of young actors.  The show is an adaptation of a series of juvenile novels that I have not read, so I suppose that is why some of the lead characters were stuck with such god awful names like Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf (though I'll hasten to add that Serena is the best character on the show and the actor who portrays her, Blake Lively, the show's break out star).  But whatever the limitations of the source, Schwartz and his team of writers did a great job of making the characters interesting and, in their own way, likable.  The central interest in the show is the Manhattan/Brooklyn romance between Serena and Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley).  The cast of characters is rounded out by Queen B Blair, her romantic interests/entanglements Chuck Bass and Nate Archibald (odd to have a character on a TV show with the name of a famous athlete).  Dan's younger sister, Jenny, is played by Taylor Momsen, who is the only teen character who is the age she is supposed to be playing.  But she does a great job of hanging with the oldsters.  Everyone in the cast does at least a creditable job.  Ed Westwick is quite good as my least favorite character on the show, Chuck Bass.  Why do I hate him?  Well, early on he is presented as a serial rapist.  'Nuff said.  In Hays Code Hollywood it would be a strict requirement that he would have to atone for his sins by dying before the final curtain rings down.  I'm not sure how you can redeem a rapist on a show like this.  My guess is that they are going to ignore that he is a sex offender and instead just pretend that he is just sowing his wild oats.  But drugging a woman for sex is rape, pure and simple.  I hope the series sees him going to prison.  There are also some great adult characters, much as in THE O.C., but so far the adults have not been as interesting as those in Schwartz's earlier show.  I like Dan's father and Serena's mom, but neither is as interesting as Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, let alone Julie Cooper.  And why, precisely, does Serena's mom Lily ALWAYS have a glass of champagne in her hand?

One other member of the cast deserves special mention and that is the one who portrays, entirely off screen, the title character:  Kristen Bell.  I was and still am devastated that VERONICA MARS was cancelled, but in that magnificent show's demise Kristen has been, like Elvis, spotted almost everywhere.  One of the things that made VERONICA MARS so successful (at least artistically, if not in terms of viewers) was Kristen Bell's wonderful voice-overs.  The premise of the show is that an anonymous blogger is posting online all the adventures of Serena, Blair, Dan, Jenny, and company.  Bell's narration is simply the supposed content of that blog.  I'm not sure if they will reveal precisely who Gossip Girl is, though you figure it would have to be someone acquainted with the major character.  Perhaps it will turn out to be the Waldorf maid.

One other thing to mention as contributing to the show's success:  it is filmed on location in New York.  I've found so many shows irritating because of their supposed location.  I live in Chicago and while I enjoy SAMANTHA WHO, every exterior shot of Chicago in that show drives me batty.  Who could have guessed Chicago looked so much like L.A.?  Ditto UGLY BETTY.  At least that show will be moving to NY for its third season.  But GOSSIP GIRL benefited at every point from its setting in New York.

All in all, this was a delightful show in its first season.  A great show like BUFFY or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA or FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS or SIX FEET UNDER?  Absolutely not.  Those shows aspire to be more than merely popular entertainment.  But if you need a guilty pleasure show, a series that has little in the way of redeeming qualities apart from delighting in the wicked, wicked exploits of the idle rich, you can't top this.",1211587200,33,6572,4.611541774332472

2963050,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl: Starring Leighton Meester, Blake Lively, Kristen Bell, Penn Badgley, Taylor Momsen, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, Matthew Settle and Jessica Szohr.

It's easy to write Gossip Girl off as a flighty teen drama about spoiled rich teenagers that whine and complain about those trivial problems over 80% of America wishes they had to worry about. You see the shows on MTV like ""My Super Sweet 16"" and see teen girls whine to their parents because ""they wanted the Valentino, not the Dolce"". While not groundbreaking, Gossip Girl has engrossing plots, relatable characters, snarky dialog and effervescent visuals.

In 2005 when Gossip Girl was to be made into to movie starring Lindsay Lohan, I read the first book curious what the series was about. It was interesting, the books center around a jealous and privileged teenager named Blair Waldorf who after her best friend (and worst nightmare) Serena van der Woodsen returns from boarding school is once again insecure about herself now that she's the new 'it girl'. The scandals and mishaps between her and her friends are chronicled by an anonymous blogger who goes by ""Gossip Girl"" who ensure the only secret she keeps is her identity. She also endures the usual teenage temptations; sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Well, maybe not rock and roll, but she's got her vices. Add to the mix some other quirky characters, a pothead boyfriend, and an eating disorder and you've got yourself one traumatic adolescence.

After the series was greenlit by the CW, I was honestly curious and excited to see this show. I thought it would be better as a TV series because it's a book series, and I've never seen a successful condensation of storylines transferring onto the big screen for one jumbled movie with a bloated running time. The pilot itself was decent; there were some obvious changes (some I didn't care for) but overall I saw the potential for a great teen drama. The problem with Gossip Girl is that it seems as though the creators (or executives) don't know what direction to take the show. We have been given a handful of great episodes that would be easy to pitch as ""the next great teen drama"", but there have been lots of others that are confused, lack direction, and fall flat from prior expectations.

First and foremost, the changes the series made mostly are about the characters. The character of Serena was supposed to be annoyingly perfect. She is the ""it girl"" of New York. Tall, thin, blonde, and effortlessly breezy. In the TV series, she seems to be just there, lacking purpose or reason. That was one dynamic I appreciated from the books, as I think that it speaks for teenage girls' insecurities. A lot of girls think their classmates have this guidebook that tells them how to dress, act, and look perfect, while they inside crumble. Serena is that girl, and on the surface she looks perfect, but she has her demons too. Then there are some other obvious changes, like Jenny's character and appearance, Dan's personality, and Vanessa's ensemble. There were a lot of quirks that were taken out and have resulted in a plain cardboard cutout.

Throughout Gossip Girl's first season, the series strays more and more from the books and in time adapts to its own creation. The real issue is that Gossip Girl lacks a genuine identity, throughout the first 10 episodes every episode revolves around some 'wonderful party', that gets old as we are overwhelmed by this ""privileged lifestyle"" that instead of being shown to us is simply told, or rather listed. Fans complained creator Josh Schwartz copied a lot of plot elements from his previous successful teen drama The O.C. and Gossip Girl lacked originality. While the series at times became cliche, there have always been occasional glimpses of brilliance. Here I take down the 'best' and 'worst' list of episodes of Gossip Girl's first season.

The Best:

Episode 2: The Wild Brunch

Serena realizes she's not welcome, Dan and Chuck almost tear eachother to shreds but good-boy Nate steps in, Jenny becomes engrossed in Blair's lifestyle, and a butler at Bart's brunch gets knocked over in a teenage crossover.

Episode 5: Dare Devil

Alpha-bitch Blair Waldorf invites social climber Jenny Humphrey to her sleepover and sets her up for humiliation. Meanwhile Serena has her first date with Lonely Boy, and Amanda's boyfriend put his tongue in the same mouth that breathes his secret to his girlfriend.

Episode 7: Victor/Victrola

What do you get when you combine a burlesque bar, a Blair ultimatum, Dan's sexual research and Vanessa's jealousy? One pretty damn good episode.

Episode 13: The Thin Line Between Chuck and Nate

Gossip Girl is being flooded by rumors of a pregnant Serena. Meanwhile, Blair's two men fight for their honor, Jenny rises up the social totem pole thanks to newfound friends Penelope and Hazel, and Dan thinks he's in love with Serena. Thinks.

Episode 14: The Blair Bitch Project

Blair, recently de-throned as queen bee forcibly returns for a grueling day at school, but after little Jenny tries to take the throne, Blair puts her best Jimmy Choo forward to face off. The outcome of this schoolyard fight proves this freshman won't go down without a fight.

Episode 16: All About My Brother

In the final battle for Queen Bee, Blair and Jenny face off in the sharpest episode of the season. Meanwhile, Dan sees something he shouldn't have, Rufus and Lilly's romantic life heats up, and two characters reveal their true nature. Also, Georgina Sparks (played brilliantly by Michelle Trachenburg) continues to wreak havoc on Serena's life.

The Worst:

Episode 3: Poison Ivy

Was the choir singing Glamorous by Fergie?! This episode hits a few more speedbumps down the road, and except for the final scene, was really just a filler episode.

Episode 6: The Handmaiden's Tale

For a lame episode centering around some ""glamorous event"", we can watch MTV, thanks. Oh, and the costumes for this episode were... questionable.

Episode 18: Much 'I Do' About Nothing

For a season finale, this episode certainly didn't live up to it's predecessors. Loose ends are tied up way too quickly, Dan pulls the a-hole card, Chuck does a 360 on personality, and Blair plays the little girl that cried tattletale.

Overall, if you enjoyed Mean Girls, or Cruel Intentions, there's something you'll like about Gossip Girl. Though this season was somewhat shaky at times, it's never boring and always is entertaining.

3197349,5,B000W6ZUUC,this show is clearly addictive and i kno that i am not the only one to think so...it is what everyone and i really do mean everyone talks about. it is cool because i went to an all girls school and live in the city so i understand the drama and basically live off of it. i just show the season finale and don't know what to do with myself until it comes on again next year! i also can't wait till august,1211155200,3,403,3.8674698795180724
3197350,4,B000W6ZUUC,"I have been religiously reading the book series ever since it first came out, so when I heard about the TV show, I had extremely high expectations, and must say I was not at all happy with the first episode. I could not believe the way that they had completely changed the look of some of the main characters. So for a while I stopped watching the show, but my curiousity got the best of me, and after it came back after having been on hiatus for a while, I resumed watching it, and I admit, I was hooked.

Although many things are completely different than the book series, the show still has that provacative, addictive edge that will keep you coming back for more.

Now, if you are a fan of the books, such as myself, yet have never seen the show before, I feel this are some things I must warn you about.

First of all, many of the storylines that happen on the show, never happened in the book. I won't go into detail about any of the plots though, because I don't want to give anything away.
I was a bit angry about everything being so different at first, but then after having thought about it rationally for a while, I realize that this is after all a TV show, and if they went exactly by the book, chapter for chapter, then the show certainly wouldn't have enough plots to last for more than one season!

Second of all, (the thing that disappointed me most) the characters of Dan, Rufus, Jenny, and Vanessa look extremely different on the show, than the way that they are described in the book. Drastically different, in fact. And in the books, Serena has a hot older brother, yet on the show, he turns into her younger brother.

But they did get a few of the characters right.

The extremely sexy Chace Crawford makes THE perfect Nate Archibald...in fact he may even be more delicious on the show than the way they describe him in the book! The only flaw that he has is that in the book he is a chronic stoner, but not on the show, although that's really no big deal.

The lovely Leighton Meester makes a wonderful Blair, actually coming very close to the way I had imagined her to be in the book, and the same goes for the beautiful Blake Lively, who plays the role of Serena.

And then we come to Ed Westwick, who plays the role of Chuck Bass. I am extremely impressed. He makes the perfect Chuck, from the way he looks, right down to his personality.

So yes, ill admit I started off being very critical, but now I consider myself a fan of the show, and am eagerly awaiting for it to come out on DVD, as well as for the new season to begin.

If your a fan of the books, who started out skeptically as I did, then I feel that you should give the show a chance. You might find that you actually enjoy it!",1211155200,31,2715,4.223938223938224
3197351,3,B000W6ZUUC,"Let me start off by saying, I am a huge fan of the books.

The pilot to me was a complete let down.  I really did not like it.  I didn't like the castings, the acting, a lot of the story lines.  So, I didn't watch it for about 5 more episodes.

The episodes until the writer's strike didn't have me hooked, but I did have some fun with them, and my family enjoyed them.

The episodes in April and May, the last third of the season, were a step up.  The characters became more interesting and the plot lines became way better.  Georgina, played by Michelle Trachtenberg, brought the needed spice.

So, I can conclude that the series is getting better over time, and I have some pretty big expectations for next season.

It's not a perfect show, it has it's bland moments, but it is a guilty pleasure.  If you're looking for substance or subtle humor, this isn't it.  If you want some mindless fun, check it out.",1211068800,9,910,4.288235294117647
3197352,5,B000W6ZUUC,"This show is great and what is best is that it stays true somewhat to the books, but is different enough to not be dull to those of us who have loved the books. Lots of changes in the characters. Those who read the books, you know Jenny is different, dan and Vanessa are different as well. It is awesome and I wonder if Baby Yale will ever be on the show.",1210118400,3,355,3.9444444444444446
3197353,5,B000W6ZUUC,"This is now my favourite show. I live in New Zealand and we don't yet have it on TV. Hopefully we will soon. But I watch it over the internet and it is soooooooooo awesome. Normally I wouldn't be bothered to do this but I love this show so much that I don't care about the hassles. While some scenes may be suggestive, I don't think that there is anything more explicit on this programme than anything else on American TV. I find the drama captivating, and the similarities to a typical teenager's life (in any country) is great.  Although some stuff I can only guess if it happens in Schools in the USA. BOTTOM LINE. I think this show is brilliant. I would let my ten year old watch this show as I honestly don't believe that there is anything worse on this show than others.",1209340800,4,776,4.27891156462585
3197354,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I'll start by saying that I'm 31yo, female, married with kids :)  I've always been fond of teenager drama; something I never really outgrew.  I've found this show's storylines interesting and entertaining, enjoying both the stories of the teenagers and their parents.

The show's greatest perk imo is in the costuming.  Each character in each scene is wearing an eye catching, or in some way riveting outfit, including the men.  Accessories are used beautifully.  The actors themselves of course provide their own eye candy.

A WORD OF CAUTION TO PARENTS however.  In the seven episodes I've watched so far there has been a great deal of alcohol imbibing by the teenagers, including a 14yo.  It is implied that one of the teenagers habitually uses a drug, pot if I remember correctly, which is discussed as trivial in light of a parent's cocaine use.  One of the teenager characters is occasionally seen sleeping with women paid by his father.

From the first episode it is clear that almost all of the teenage characters are sexually active or plotting to be.  In the seventh episode, a parent gives advice on ambience for his son's planned night of virginity loss in his bedroom on a night the rest of the family will all be out of the house.

Bottom line - A lovely guilty pleasure for adults who enjoy the genre but off limits to minors whose parents are hoping to instill morals in their children and teenagers.",1207612800,15,1416,4.7306122448979595
3197355,4,B000W6ZUUC,"This is the ultimate guilty pleasure show. The characters are shallow at best, yet somehow you find yourself completely sucked in to the totally unbelievable soap opera they live in, complete with whimsical names, parents that don't care, and more money than most bank tellers see in a year.

The show starts out about Serena (played by Blake Lively) a good girl with a bad past, yet somewhere after the first few episodes Blair (Leighton Meester's character) Serena's best friend/enemy, starts to completely outshine Serena with her complicated love life, parent troubles, and glossed over eating disorder.

My only complaint is that (I imagine due to the writers strike) the season finale completely sagged. Hopefully (if there is a...) next season, it will pick back up again.

Worth watching, though I couldn't exactly tell you why. It's a complete guilty pleasure, and somehow, no matter how ridiculous the plots may seem, it always keeps you coming back for more.",1201737600,24,969,5.081761006289308
3197356,4,B000W6ZUUC,"So far I've had some really mixed reactions to GOSSIP GIRL.  First and foremost, who gives a frak about the social elite?  Well, I guess someone out there does, but as a group I find them a tedious lot at best, at least in fictional settings.  I suppose I shouldn't have said ""foremost,"" because another reason I have sometimes disliked the show is the way that Josh Schwartz shows (well, at least THE O.C.) tend to introduce extraordinarily unlikable characters that the show persists in keeping right in your face.  In this one we have two inconceivable unpleasant characters, Blair's boyfriend, who has all the personality of a manikin, and his buddy the serial rapist.  My suspicion has always been that Josh Schwartz doesn't understand the difference between characters that we love to hate and characters that we merely hate.

So why did this episode appeal to me so much?  Easy.  Neither Manikin Boy nor Serial Rapist Boy are in the episode for even a second.  Instead, the episode focuses mainly on Serena and Dan's first official date and Dan's sister Jenny's experiences at a Blair sleepover where they all play Truth or Dare.

Unfortunately, Manikin Boy and Serial Rapist Boy aren't dead and will tragically reappear, dragging the show down every second in which they appear.  My hope is that Schwartz and Co. will have learned from THE O.C. and its string of tediously unlikable characters (from Oliver to the end); my fear is that they haven't.",1193097600,,1457,4.834677419354839

Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley) and Jenny  Humphrey (Taylor Momsen) are brother and sister who lives in Brooklyn with their divorced dad named  Rufus Humphrey (Matthew Settle).  The student to a prep school one for boys called St. Jude and the girls go to Constance Billard.  Everyone in the school loves looking at Gossip Girl which is a blog. Gossip Girl is like Facebook.

The show begins with Serena returns to the Upper East Side from boarding school.  Blair has been dating Nate Archibald since kindergarten.  At a wedding the year before the show started Serena and Nate had sex.  The night that Nate and Blair were planning on having a special night Nate told Blair about  the night the wedding. Serena and Dan starts dating.  Blair and Nate break up.  Chuck and Blair start dating and Chuck tells Blair he likes her.  Chuck and Nate are best friends.

3197422,4,B000W6ZUUC,"The pilot (very first episode) of Gossip Girl is one of the best I've ever seen.  The debut season is pretty strong overall too.  It's a character driven dramedy about the lives of Manhattan's elite full of twists and turns.  The main character is Serena VanderWoodsen, played by Blake Lively who's just returned from boarding school and is harboring several dark secrets, but the real character to watch is Blair Waldorf, Serena's snobby ice queen best frenemy,expertly played by Leighton Meester.  If the rest of the series had stayed this good, the show could've went down as one of the best teen dramas of all time, but alas, after this season the show turns into a soap operady (soap/comedy) about the incorrigible character, Chuck Bass, played by Ed Westwick, and his on/off again abusive relationship with Blair.  The story lines become repetitive and insipid and all of the other characters either get pushed aside or destroyed to prop up Chuck Bass.  Don't waste your time or your money on the other seasons.

3197426,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I am a 50 year old male, Give or take a year or two :) and I actually Love this show. I Live in the Gold Coast in Chicago  on North LSD ( NO NOT the DRUG,the Road, Lake Shore Drive) so i know what it`s like to be AROUND the filthy rich! I am NOT one of them although i wish i was :) Anyhow.... they got alot of this show right in my opinion and picked perfect cast members.
 MOST of The Filthy Rich in Chicago (Not all) are not as Uppity as New yorks Rich are but i am sure the people here ""Get it"" anyhow. I mean I get it and I am not rich by anyones definition.

The Writers, Characters, the back and forth Banter and basically everything in this show is good. When it`s suppose to be funny it`s very funny. When its suppose to be sad it`s exactly that and so on. It also gives us a look into what it`s like to have all that money and be able to do whatever you want whenever you want but also to know that NO amount of money can get you out of certain Troubles.

That said, My favorite part besides the Characters/Actors is that the show lets you see how ""Human"" you are whether you are Rich (Chuck) or not (Rufus,Dan and ""J"") I think they do a very good job getting emotions out of the actors. I mean lets face it... Alot of these Actors know exactly what it is like to be rich so they come into this with a general idea anyhow.

Well.. thats it. I wanted to give it 1 star, I thought about giving it 4 stars but honestly i had to give it 5. I like it that much.",1357257600,3,1466,3.8410596026490067

3197428,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Season 1 of Gossip Girl begins our journey into Manhattan's elite and scandalous Upper East Side. We encounter sex, lies, secrets, and schemes at every turn. We're introduced to characters so deliciously shrewd, we don't know whether to root for them or hope for their inevitable demise. Yet they are well written characters nevertheless; layered with hidden agendas and sympathetic backstories.

These prominent characters who will shape the rest of the series are..

Dan -- an outsider from the wrong side of the tracks thrust into the elite world of the UES.
Chuck -- a cold and callous womanizer, who at first glance, appears to show no semblance of a soul or conscience.
Serena -- a reformed party girl eager to change her rebellious ways.
Blair -- conniving and ruthless in all her endeavors, yet consistently driven to succeed.
Jenny - the social climber, desperate to enter this elite world at any and all costs.
Nate -- the quintessential brooding pretty boy, burdened by his family's own shady misgivings.

These are characters who you may occasionally loathe, but will inevitably grow to care about.

What makes these characters redeemable? Their backstories. The show propels us into their world. We peer into their home lives. We discover where they come from, who they are, and what provokes their choices and actions. The character's families become an integral part of the series as well. The drama isn't solely centered on the teenage characters. The characters' parents find themselves oddly connected to the drama in their kids' lives as well. As we venture into their lavished Upper East Side world, we are transported into high society; extravagant parties and luxurious fashion. We're exposed to a world that is both enticing and addictive to viewers. The scandals that the characters wrap themselves in are complex and provocative. And the viewer becomes addicted to these scandals; each one more outrageous than the last. The writers never disappoint, as they keep the scandalous plot twists coming at every corner.

The first season of Gossip Girl belongs in an elite group of its own...as it re-defines the teen drama genre by blending the sophistication of 5th Avenue with a hint of raunchy abrasiveness. While it may lack in depth and realism, one can still appreciate Season 1 of Gossip Girl for what it is -- an addictive guilty pleasure that will keep you coming back for more.",1356134400,,2408,5.01

3197449,5,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl is a teen/adult show with an excellent cast, AMAZING wardrobe, and juicy plots. An anonymous woman reports on the lives of upper class New Yorkers and people who associate with them, and this is how we penetrate into the lives of Serena, Blair, Nate, Chuck, Dan, Jenny, and eventually Vanessa.

The show is very similar to other popular teen shows these days, in the sense that the characters deal with issues with drugs, sex, and family conflicts. What I especially like about this series, though, is that they have pretty witty one-liners and complicated plots in which different characters' situations intertwine.

If you're watching Season 4 currently on the CW, but you missed out on one or more of the earlier seasons, you might be a little lost when it comes to what's going on. Thus, I would highly recommend you start watching with Season 1 and work your way up. Even in the new season, the characters make references to events that happened in the first season, and you're not going to know what exactly that was unless you watch it for yourself.

Also, it's a really great idea to buy it here on Amazon, as opposed to elsewhere. Believe me, this is the cheapest price you'll find for a new DVD set.",1290470400,,1221,4.643518518518518

3197459,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I have to admit I never watched this show from the beginning - but after purchasing the complete first season, I have fallen in love with the show. As an avid OC fan I didn't know whether this show would embody the same complexities as the OC often did with characters whom are multifaceted -

Then I met Chuck bass I can honestly say I have never been immersed in a character as much as I have been with him - his ability to remain with a contained and measured controlled exterior his stylized attention to detail and his charisma and vulnerability juxtaposes with his devilish plots and turns is truly captivating - he is an amazing talent truly a find his blend of heartbreak and heartbreaker and tragedy makes him a powerful lead actor, although the show is pitched through its protagonist Dan his entrance to the upper east side, it is Chuck journey most captivating he is an outsider detached at times from the social fabric of society in many ways he epitomizes a figure who at times can be the conscious on the show - he is the one all the characters turn to for help and he always delivers. His complex love affair with Blair the quintessential upper east sider her properness and her insurgence for titles and the trimmings of lady love, makes this character intriguing her character brings out his vulnerability and his fear of not being able to be loved or whether he can even love at times makes for a heartbreaking watch - It is his triumphant in the dhow we are most interested in - his escapism through drugs and meaningless flings with women make him even more complex he numbs his pain- the other characters just do not compare .

Blair played by Leighton Meester is excellent she gives a performance of a modern day Scarlett in Gone with the wind, She loves Chuck Bass but he is not conventional and neither she is - this a heartbreaking tale of two powerful lovers coming together - Dan is a moralist but selfish he lacks the depth of chuck and his love with Serena appears superficial he does not love her for who she is - Nate is the rich pretty by who is lost in a world he has no belonging he is even more tragic because despite efforts he never does anything worth any value - his friendship with Chuck is his only saving grace because he truly cares for him. I feel sorry for Vanessa her attempt to be the sidekick of Dan seems contrived =it just doesn't serve a great purpose - I do however think she has the repertoire to be a great actress but the script does allow her to pursue her talent - she becomes submerged in quick wit lines with now weight and end up making her seem annoying. Serena the all American girl - the cheerleader type I like her as she is consistent but she does not have the convoluted mixture both Blair and Chuck have.

I have watched the whole of this complete season and I loved every moment of it - the unraveling of the brilliant Chuck and his love with Blair is compelling - Ed West wick is a amazing actor his true brilliance to capture very scene and demand with his powerful presence is what transports Gossip Girl from a mild and Luke warm tale of upper side rich spoilt teenagers to a highly quality show which actually delves beneath the exterior the show has truly exhibited excellence in the casting of Ed West wick without him literally the show would hold neither value.

I decided when these neat ""little"" coins (actually the quarter is the biggest of the commonly minted US coins)( It goes dime, penny, nickel, quarter)(no you're not crazy the dime is just slightly smaller then the penny even though it is worth TEN TIMES MORE!!!) started being released that I would go about a different route then what all those fancy smancy TV ads were offering. ( You know the ones for those glossy state maps with coin slots for each state and a new coin sent to you each time it was released?)( Convenient though! ;) ) I decided to make my own map ( And I did!) (It's not as glossy, but WHO CARES!!) (Because I had fun doing it and I got to learn the placement of the states better!!!) And here is what I consider the most adventurous part (and the most nail bitting! ;) )  I just waited! (WHAT?!) (LOL, i'll explain) Every time a new US State Quarter was released I simply  just waited for it to come along. (It was pretty simple actually and usually didn't even take very long until the new coin made it into my hands.) Every time a new quarter was released I would make sure to check my change and see if the new State Quarter had made it my way yet!!!!! (Kinda wish ya'd did it that way too, huh!? =D) It turned out to be a lot of fun and I even learned a little bit about patience! (sometimes my friends had their quarters before me!!!!!!!!)( a lot of the time actually :P)(Oh well, I had more fun! =P) Lesson Learned?: Don't be afraid to try doing things a little differently then others, you might discover a whole new world out there that you never imagined was there!",1241568000,,1904,4.228021978021978

The creator of The O.C draws a parallel with the life we witnessed in the life of Ryan, Marissa, etc, and the life of Blair, Serena, or Dan (the outsider, the eye of the spectator).
If you like teen tv show, complex relationships, I would tell you to buy this DVD. (However, it is not the same story as in the books).",1236902400,,472,4.197802197802198

The Parental units are hot
( how old is Rufus?) and play the proper supporting role to rumor, scandal and innuendo that is the GG way. Very well cast, fast enough paced and just different enough to push a few buttons in the classic teen genre. Love it, need it, want series 2",1235174400,,579,4.523809523809524

3197487,4,B000W6ZUUC,"I had never seen an episode of Gossip Girl before- the CW network we are unable to get at my house. But I heard people talking about it and magazines saying it's a good show. So when the first season came out on DVD, I immediately bought it. The first night I watched the first 2 episodes and liked it, but was not completely raving about the show. The more episodes I watched- the more I got into the show, though. Honestly, the episode where blair and chuck are at the burlesque club (around ep 6 or 7) that is where I begin to really like the show. To me Blair, is an absolutely wonderful character- she is conniving, mean, mischevious, sweet, and funny. Blair is a complex character- and really makes the show for me. I like all of the ensemble, I also like the ""frenemy"" apsect to Serena and Blair.

This show is my guilty pleasure. It is a fast talking, pop-culture dropping show. Plus the fact that they take advantage of NYC's scenic atmosphere doesn't hurt. This is not a deep thinking show, but it is campy fun. It's the kind of show that you can just sit and watch and enjoy.",1233187200,3,1086,4.297560975609756

This seller saw to it that my gift for my girl friend, which by the way was all explained to the seller as well, as far as this being a Christmas gift for my girl friend.

The actors and actresses on this show are extremely talented and the plot line never fails to please. The wardrobe another added bonus - its awesome!",1232150400,,468,4.650602409638554
3197496,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I kept putting this show off because it just didn't do a thing for me within the first ten minutes of the first episode. None of the actors seemed to have the WOW factor to keep me glued. Here we are almost a year later and the show has arrived on DVD. Me being the bargain shopper that I am, I decided to finally pick this up on DVD solely based on the fact that it was under seventeen dollars. Considering there's only eighteen episodes making each episode a little less than one dollar (Total Bargain). Needless to say, I was bored last night and needed something to watch and this flipped the bill perfectly. I finally gave this show a chance and it was worth it.
Yes, the acting is bad and even on some levels hideous by some of the actors - amateurish acting at its best. Even veteran actors like Matthew Settle and Kelly Rutherford don't really deliver the goods either. It's true what they say - You have to work with what you're given and these actors aren't given the best lines. Nor do I believe that the director of each episodes pushes to get the best of them. But under the cheap exterior of a soap opera with actors in their twenties playing teens, lies a decent show.
The lead actress Blake Lively looks like she is in her thirties during the first few seconds of the show on her train ride into Grand Central Station and pretty much in every episode as well. It bothers me that she doesn't look seventeen, but I can handle it.
The show reminds me a lot of Cruel Intentions for some strange reason. If Manchester Prep School was made into a show, this would be that show.
I feel helpless because the show is almost done with its second season and I am only on episode three of season one.
The show revolves around Serena, the so-called IT GIRL who has disappeared for boarding school only a few months in only to make a surprise return into the city. Her old posse are all in shock when she returns and after much negative influence from Blair is axed from their inner circle. Though the narrator, Kristen Bell, keeps harping on the fact that it revolves around the lives of the rich and privileged in the Upper East Side of Manhattan - this couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth. I adore that the show is shot in Manhattan, but it's rarely on the UES. Many of the scenes are shot around Midtown and under. The Palace Hotel where Serena stays during the first season is in the fifties on Madison Ave. And the UES is not even all that. Everyone that lives in Manhattan knows how untrendy the UES is. It's just a playground for married couples who have children and want to pay overprice fees to send them to private schools instead of public schools.
Leighton Meester (Blair Waldorf) is just a bad actress. So is the young sister (Jenny Humphrey) played by Taylor Momsen. She is beyond atrocious in the acting department. If speaking like a valley girl means acting than I must have that act down pat. But, Ed Westwick (Chuck Bass) was born to play his role. Everything about his overall presence fits the part of the snotty angry rich kid that causes nothing but trouble. He wreaks havoc perfectly.
Overall there is promise for this show. It's packed with beautiful people (for the most part) and the basic premise is an interesting spin. It's like watching celebrities live their lives after they read their own gossip that swirls the headlines and the fury ensues.
Though this show is much like most teen soaps, lacking real talent and most of its stars just don't have the x-factor - its still deliciously devilish fun in the vein of Melrose Place. Kristen Bell narrates this show annoyingly yet fittingly with that darn teen condescending voice of hers. If you need something on TV to keep you entertained since Sex and the City went south after season three, this is the show for you. You know you love it XOXO! Hahaha",1231891200,5,3847,4.458156028368794

Based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar, this CW show is narrated by the mysterious title character. Not really so mysteries as it is that of the recogniziable voice of Kritsen Bell, who was both seen and heard on three seasons of ""Veronica Mars"". This first season of ""Gossip Girl"" begins with the return of Serena van der Woodsen (played by Blake Lively of ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" movies.) The question of why Serena left in the first place is not answered until near the end of the season. Each of the 18 episodes contained in this DVD set are satisfying viewing because each one of them is a well written, well acted, well done piece of storytelling.",1227484800,,761,4.521739130434782

It probably wouldn't appeal to much to the older crowd (at least over 35) and it may have too much inappropriate content for younger than say, 13. Its a great show over all though.

It's about Manhattan's elite and the wild children of socialites, and real estate mogul's, etc. Some of it's farfetched and unrealistic, but even if you don't like the show the fashion is amazing. It deals with some real teenage issues- coke snorting, and date rape, at the extreme. It's not for young viewers, or even young adult viewers really. It's definitely an adult show. However, since these kids are in highschool it seems a little silly they are always sitting around bars drinking, but hey...teen shows are supposed to be a little cheesy, right?

3197521,5,B000W6ZUUC,"Remember the episode of ""Seinfeld"" where Jerry claimed to have never seen an episode of ""Melrose Place"". And then under a lie detector test confessed his addiction to it? That's how I feel about Gossip Girl. I read a few articles about it but never saw an episode until its first season finale. I taped it and then all the reruns of the first season (sorry, no DVR yet!). Then I spent Labor Day weekend watching all of them in order. This is a supremely addicting show that only got better as season 1 rolled on and its characters' storylines played out.

Gossip Girl is like an east coast version of ""90120"" or ""The O.C."" and follows the spoiled rich kids of New York's upper west side, who live in a world of elite schools, designer clothes, limos and endless excesses. And whose reputations can be made or broken by a few lines in a mysterious website called Gossip Girl. The purveyor of this site is never seen, only heard in voice-overs by Kristen Bell. The series centers on Serena van der Woodson and her return (from parts unknown) to New York, and her reconnecting with her often catty classmate Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meissner) and her denizens at their elite private school. Blair's feelings for another classmate, Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), have been jeopardized when she has an ill-fated tryst in a limo. Nate tries to keep himself together as his family slowly implodes and his unrequited love for Blair is tested by the fallout from her limo indiscretion with Chuck Bass. Serena also attempts to reconcile with longtime boyfriend Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgeley), whose younger sister Jenny has fallen under the spell of Blair's clique. With unforeseen and potentially dangerous consequences. Dan still carries a torch for Manhattan's Serena, but must try to balance his feelings with that for old Brooklyn friend Vanessa. And as with any show of this kind, there must be an element of danger. In this case, it's from bad boy Chuck Bass, who cruelly blackmails Blair with details of their limo tryst. Bass becomes even more loathsome for Serena when he becomes her stepbrother. Serena's life gets even more complex when a destructive nemesis from her past (Michelle Trachtenberg of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") shows up and fatally disrupts the new life she's been building since her return to New York.  The end result of this storyline is surprising, as they all band together to ""take down the bitch"" as Chuck so eloquently puts it. But that ""take down"" comes at the cost of Dan & Serena's relationship. But Nate's life starts to look up when he finds a new ally in Serena in the season 1 finale.

I've neglected to mention the actress playing Serena, because I must single her out. She's played by Blake Lively (""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" films). She is truly one of the most beautiful actresses working today and was made for a part like this. She can play a vulnerable and strong character with ease. I really believe great things are in store for this beauty.

Can't believe I'm saying this, but to quote the Gossip Girl;

And the show is just,AWSOME,don't think it will last very long but I still enjoy it and maybe will till it ends (in a good way and circompstences I hope...).
For those who think it's crap,just don't watch it,cause normally when you don't like something you don't even bother giving it intentions,or maybe you don't have a life for doing such things,which is sad for you...

3197526,4,B000W6ZUUC,"I wanted to watch this because of the books I read some years back and saw some of it while in America.  I got immediately hooked and actually enjoy the show (while though not my absolute favourite).  I love to watch the clothes and the scenes of New York, but the one thing I hate the most is the acting.  I love Dan except to me, he's the worst actor in here (and the hottest).
The show features rich snobby kids in NY, and a brother and sister 'from the wrong side of the tracks' (the poor side) who all go to the same school and the drama's that ensue are because of text messages all the school kids get from Gossip Girl (who we don't know).  It has b*tchiness and s*x and drugs and alcohol and everything in between in it - all the things that make this show addictive (to watch).
If you're looking for Emmy nomination material, you won't find it here (not for acting anyway - maybe for costumes), but this is light fluffy trash that is meant to be a teenage soap opera brought to you by the O.C creators (which by the way was a much better show).  It's fun to watch and so I definately recommend it if you love a little escapism at the end of a long work day.",1221264000,5,1166,4.0964912280701755

3197530,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Hello. My name is Laurie. I'm 22 years-old. And I am...addicted to Gossip Girl. There. I said it.

I had read the Gossip Girl books back when they first came out. And I liked them. I never did end up finishing the series. So when I heard they were creating a TV show based on the books I was mildly interested. But I actually didn't end up watching it due to my own gripes with the CW network.

But I ended up catching the end of an episode posted on youtube (Victor Victrola) and was instantly intrigued. So I watched the previous episodes online. It moved a little slow at first, but it soon picked up. And by the time the next episode aired on TV, I was hooked!

Let me just say that this show is NOT anymore scandalous/provocative  than other TV shows! That's all hype that the CW lets build in order to create buzz around the show. So all these parental boards freaking out need to chill. You're kids have probably already seen worse- hate to break it to you.

Yeah the show can be silly and dramatized. That's half the fun! And its nice to escape my boring everyday life for an hour and get caught up in it! In my opinion, it blows the novels right out of the water!

Another thing I like about the show is the cast. They always seem to be down to earth and cool in real life, and I think they do a great job with the material they're given. Its VERY easy for some of the story lines to become cheesy and redundant (given its technically a TEEN drama), but they always seem to pull it off and make it seem believable.

My only con of the DVDs is that there is no cast commentary of an episode. I think that would have been a good feature to have! The bloopers, however, are pretty hilarious.

There's a reason there's so much buzz about the show with young and older audiences alike. And that is because it truly is an addicting show. And every week you find yourself more buried in it than the week before. Its a vicious cycle really...

I definitely recommend it. Season 2 starts September 1st on the CW and I've never been so happy to see summer end! I know its gonna be good.

I don't think it's meant to be very deep but I'm guessing you'll be surprised how much these ""shallow"" characters actually get to grow on you. At times, I felt they were taking my heart out and squeezing it. It may seem like just a teen show...but it's actually very entertaining. Don't expect to learn anything, but that's the fun. It's sparkly and sexy, and may just rot your brain...but completely worth it!

3197532,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Finally, a teen drama which scores with its take and spin on the absurd and stupid genre. Everyone knows that this style of drama is far fetched, highly unbelievable, and utterly pathetic when placed in such serious contexts with moral issues. But Josh Schwartz,  the creator of Gossip Girl, is turning the show into a ""close sister"" to his original work: The OC. And his work is the complete opposite of portraying ridiculous incidents for teenagers and their disfunctional parents to take part in such serious manners. Gossip Girl takes a refreshing approach to the teen drama genre with humor, heartfelt moments, self parodies, and not trying to make everything so serious with attempted ""landmarks."" It is because of these traits, that keeps Gossip Girl so interesting and enjoyable to watch. Its viewers know that teen dramas are stupid, its creators know that the genre is stupid, and so they all have fun making it stupid and fun to watch. Nothing more is needed. Making such a genre serious raises the absurdity of a such a show to extreme levels and enjoyment is lost. Josh Schwartz has learned this with his previous work. The OC fans know that ratings on the show tanked during the second and third season due to the attempts for serious writing and loosing the humorous parody of the teen drama. Now if only Schwartz and his team keep that factor in mind and don't do the same thing for the second and third year of Gossip Girl, this series will continue to be a delightful viewing pleasure with great fun. Keep Gossip Girl funny, its what made The OC so unique and successful, and its lack of existence is what makes Gossip Girl's competition (and once The OC's competition): One Tree Hill SUCK!",1219363200,8,1708,4.731543624161074

I was disappointed when looking through the episode guide to see how few episodes Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage actually wrote. Many of the story lines and character relationships seemed very similar to those of The OC. You can see how every character on GG is really modeled after one on the OC. With all these similarities I wanted a little more quick dialogue and ironic plots. As far as comparing to the books, they basically changed everything. It's not a bad show, it's extremely entertaining, but if you're looking for a direct portal into the books or a way to sooth the pain of The OC's cancellation, keep on looking.",1219190400,3,774,4.535714285714286

It was nice to see a show deal with all of this plus do it while being well written.  I would say it was my favorite show if Prison Break and One Tree Hill weren't on the air.

The season really became interesting, to me, once Chuck became a semi-leading character. Him and Blair really do make the show racy and interesting. They did a pretty good job for a season 1. Nate's character is a bit cardboard and I think the writers realized this early on and put him in the back-burner. Serena and Dan are a constant wave of emotions as are Lily/Rufus.

If you're having a hard time getting past the first few episodes try to make it to Episode 7; that one is just majestic and so very well done that you'll be hooked from then on.

3197538,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl takes place in New York City, which is what got this New Yorker into it in the first place. It's location attracted my friends, many of whom reside uptown like the characters. However, after a viewing of the pilot I saw a lot more than just some of my favorite Manhattan landmarks. With a cast of fresh faces and entertaining characters, the show has a lot to offer. Starting with Blake Lively, she plays bad girl gone bad Serena.

Returning from a trip out of town with the intensions of turning things around she starts a relationship with the token indie boy from Brooklyn. New Yorkers will laugh at the idea his being from Williamsburg is being from the other side of the tracks, due to the insane rents there. Dan played by Penn Badgley, is likable and delivers his witty one liners in a way of that of Seth Cohen. While likeable apart, the two of them together are the most boring couple of prime time. Which is disappointing due to the fact that they are the central focus of the season.

Serena's best friend Blair Warldorf is deliciously bitchy as the reigning Queen of the Upper East Side. Although Blake is the breakout star, Leighton Meister who plays Blair is the most talented actress of the bunch and not to mention the fact that she is the most entertaining character. Aside from her ups and downs as Queen B, she also dapples in love affairs with golden boy Nate, and bad boy Chuck.

Nate played by Chace Crawford in an empty eyed performance, is a wasted character who never really has too much going on. However, his best friend and the third member of the love triangle, Chuck Bass played by Ed Westwick is another amazing element of the show. His stylized, plotting man bitch is the only character who is on par with Blair. But the true star of the show is Kristen Bell as the title character and anonymous blogger. Her voice is just bitchy enough yet also warm enough to deliver the cold truth but not be too cold to care. For me anyway, she was the driving force in my love of the show, from the moment she introduces herself and telling you her identity is ""the one secret she'll never tell"", you find yourself as addicted to her and her blog as it's many readers.

But character developments were never Josh's problem, the problem was keeping them going. And, after watching the dizzying first season of the OC where more happened in seven episodes than in seven seasons of 90210 I feared that Gossip Girl would move too fast and ruin good plot lines. However, they seemed to have learned their lessons. The 18 episodes contained here, move at a great pace that allow you to enjoy the story lines yet them turning into something before they get tired of them. The only question is if they can keep it up for many more seasons, the problem with high school television dramas is that high school can only go on for so long.",1215388800,4,2858,4.469348659003831

3197544,5,B000W6ZUUC,"I don't think I can sum up this show in such few words...
- Best location ever (show is shot ON SITE in New York City). It is the most popular show in NYC for a reason!
- Hottest cast on television
- Two of the best actors to hit CW (Leighton Meester who plays Blair Waldorf and Ed Westwick who plays Chuck (was listed as one of the ""Most Underrated Actors of 2007')
- While OC had great Indie Music, Gossip Girl also has great music that is more ""mainstream""

This show was by far the most buzzed about show in 2007-2008 (heck..the most talked about show in the last 10 YEARS!!) and for good reason! If you open ANY magazine, any blog site, Gossip Girl is mentioned at least five times!

It is addictive, the storylines are fascinating, and the show is WELL WRITTEN and witty (one of the very few teen shows that is loved by many critics!).

I was drawn in to Gossip Girl because of Josh Schwartz and his work with the OC and because it was based on a book. True, Gossip Girl is different than the book but its a GREAT CHANGE. Personally, I never loved the books as much as I love the series.

However, like many Gossip Girl fans, I became OBSESSED with Gossip Girl the minute Chuck/Blair happened. This type of couple has NEVER been shown on television ever. Their chemistry is amazing, the banter, bite, and the acting by these two costar far exceeds any of the other actors on the show. Not suprising, that in a span of a few days they became  the most talked about couple. This couple is so popular they these two have been the cause for major ratings increases for various GG episodes...CW knows this couple=$$ and ratings and this is why Chuck/Blair will most likely become the main focus of season 2 which was previously held by Dan/Serena(starts on Monday September 1st at 8PM on the CW)!

If you are not sure about Gossip Girl, watch to episode 7 (Victor/Victorla) and I guarantee you won't be you won't be able to stop. The only downside of this show is that it is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!

True, Gossip Girl will never reach the critical acclaim of Battlestar Galactica and Friday night lights..but is BY FAR exceeded my expecations to become my FAVOURITE SHOW ON TELEVISION!",1211673600,25,2180,4.4214463840399
3197545,5,B000W6ZUUC,"GOSSIP GIRL could well be the first and last hit show developed by the CW in the wake of the merger of the WB and UPN.  With multiple industry sources indicating that the network is in serious trouble and may cease operation following the 2008-2009 season, GOSSIP GIRL could well find itself at a new network in the 2009-2010 season, assuming that it maintains its ""buzz"" well into its sophomore season.  But if the CW is able to reverse its current difficulties, GOSSIP GIRL could well be the reason it survives.

For a while in this past season, GOSSIP GIRL and DIRTY SEXY MONEY were fighting it out for title of top new Guilty Pleasure Show.  It was neck and neck at the break for the writers' strike, but with DIRTY SEXY ending its season prematurely, GOSSIP GIRL roared past it in the second half of the season.

GOSSIP GIRL was one of two shows created by Josh Schwartz that debuted in the fall of 2007.  The other was CHUCK.  Both shows were heavily indebted to Schwartz's previous big hit show, THE O.C.  It was as if he separated out the cool nerd elements of THE O.C. and distilled them into CHUCK (the lead role of which is reputed to originally have been offered to Adam Brody, Seth on THE O.C., though Rachel Bilson, who played Seth's girlfriend Summer, did guest on CHUCK) while the social politics of the idle rich were distilled into GOSSIP GIRL, though transposed to the East Coast.  The result was two thoroughly likable shows, though also two very different shows.  Which one prefers will depend exclusively on personal taste.

THE O.C. was seriously marred in each of its first three seasons by the introduction of a series of thoroughly despicable and evil characters, emblemized by the infamous and desperately hated Oliver from Season One.  My guess has always been that Schwartz and his co-creators never sufficiently distinguished between characters we love to hate and characters we merely hate.  Season Three of THE O.C. largely led to the show's demise with a long string of horrid and evil guest characters, even though the abbreviated Season Four was one of the series' best.  So far GOSSIP GIRL has done a splendid job of avoiding this pitfall.  The most prominent evil character so far has been Georgina, played by BUFFY's Michelle Trachtenberg (though Dawn has definitely grown up), and unlike Oliver was an utter delight.  So perhaps they've finally gotten this down.

My lone problem with the show has been the focus on the children of New York City's social elite, a group of human beings I could not possibly have less interest in (well, perhaps I find them more interesting than the history of wood lice in Iceland).  This is largely redeemed by a good-looking and talented group of young actors.  The show is an adaptation of a series of juvenile novels that I have not read, so I suppose that is why some of the lead characters were stuck with such god awful names like Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf (though I'll hasten to add that Serena is the best character on the show and the actor who portrays her, Blake Lively, the show's break out star).  But whatever the limitations of the source, Schwartz and his team of writers did a great job of making the characters interesting and, in their own way, likable.  The central interest in the show is the Manhattan/Brooklyn romance between Serena and Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley).  The cast of characters is rounded out by Queen B Blair, her romantic interests/entanglements Chuck Bass and Nate Archibald (odd to have a character on a TV show with the name of a famous athlete).  Dan's younger sister, Jenny, is played by Taylor Momsen, who is the only teen character who is the age she is supposed to be playing.  But she does a great job of hanging with the oldsters.  Everyone in the cast does at least a creditable job.  Ed Westwick is quite good as my least favorite character on the show, Chuck Bass.  Why do I hate him?  Well, early on he is presented as a serial rapist.  'Nuff said.  In Hays Code Hollywood it would be a strict requirement that he would have to atone for his sins by dying before the final curtain rings down.  I'm not sure how you can redeem a rapist on a show like this.  My guess is that they are going to ignore that he is a sex offender and instead just pretend that he is just sowing his wild oats.  But drugging a woman for sex is rape, pure and simple.  I hope the series sees him going to prison.  There are also some great adult characters, much as in THE O.C., but so far the adults have not been as interesting as those in Schwartz's earlier show.  I like Dan's father and Serena's mom, but neither is as interesting as Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, let alone Julie Cooper.  And why, precisely, does Serena's mom Lily ALWAYS have a glass of champagne in her hand?

One other member of the cast deserves special mention and that is the one who portrays, entirely off screen, the title character:  Kristen Bell.  I was and still am devastated that VERONICA MARS was cancelled, but in that magnificent show's demise Kristen has been, like Elvis, spotted almost everywhere.  One of the things that made VERONICA MARS so successful (at least artistically, if not in terms of viewers) was Kristen Bell's wonderful voice-overs.  The premise of the show is that an anonymous blogger is posting online all the adventures of Serena, Blair, Dan, Jenny, and company.  Bell's narration is simply the supposed content of that blog.  I'm not sure if they will reveal precisely who Gossip Girl is, though you figure it would have to be someone acquainted with the major character.  Perhaps it will turn out to be the Waldorf maid.

One other thing to mention as contributing to the show's success:  it is filmed on location in New York.  I've found so many shows irritating because of their supposed location.  I live in Chicago and while I enjoy SAMANTHA WHO, every exterior shot of Chicago in that show drives me batty.  Who could have guessed Chicago looked so much like L.A.?  Ditto UGLY BETTY.  At least that show will be moving to NY for its third season.  But GOSSIP GIRL benefited at every point from its setting in New York.

All in all, this was a delightful show in its first season.  A great show like BUFFY or BATTLESTAR GALACTICA or FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS or SIX FEET UNDER?  Absolutely not.  Those shows aspire to be more than merely popular entertainment.  But if you need a guilty pleasure show, a series that has little in the way of redeeming qualities apart from delighting in the wicked, wicked exploits of the idle rich, you can't top this.",1211587200,33,6572,4.611541774332472

3197547,4,B000W6ZUUC,"Gossip Girl: Starring Leighton Meester, Blake Lively, Kristen Bell, Penn Badgley, Taylor Momsen, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, Matthew Settle and Jessica Szohr.

It's easy to write Gossip Girl off as a flighty teen drama about spoiled rich teenagers that whine and complain about those trivial problems over 80% of America wishes they had to worry about. You see the shows on MTV like ""My Super Sweet 16"" and see teen girls whine to their parents because ""they wanted the Valentino, not the Dolce"". While not groundbreaking, Gossip Girl has engrossing plots, relatable characters, snarky dialog and effervescent visuals.

In 2005 when Gossip Girl was to be made into to movie starring Lindsay Lohan, I read the first book curious what the series was about. It was interesting, the books center around a jealous and privileged teenager named Blair Waldorf who after her best friend (and worst nightmare) Serena van der Woodsen returns from boarding school is once again insecure about herself now that she's the new 'it girl'. The scandals and mishaps between her and her friends are chronicled by an anonymous blogger who goes by ""Gossip Girl"" who ensure the only secret she keeps is her identity. She also endures the usual teenage temptations; sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Well, maybe not rock and roll, but she's got her vices. Add to the mix some other quirky characters, a pothead boyfriend, and an eating disorder and you've got yourself one traumatic adolescence.

After the series was greenlit by the CW, I was honestly curious and excited to see this show. I thought it would be better as a TV series because it's a book series, and I've never seen a successful condensation of storylines transferring onto the big screen for one jumbled movie with a bloated running time. The pilot itself was decent; there were some obvious changes (some I didn't care for) but overall I saw the potential for a great teen drama. The problem with Gossip Girl is that it seems as though the creators (or executives) don't know what direction to take the show. We have been given a handful of great episodes that would be easy to pitch as ""the next great teen drama"", but there have been lots of others that are confused, lack direction, and fall flat from prior expectations.

First and foremost, the changes the series made mostly are about the characters. The character of Serena was supposed to be annoyingly perfect. She is the ""it girl"" of New York. Tall, thin, blonde, and effortlessly breezy. In the TV series, she seems to be just there, lacking purpose or reason. That was one dynamic I appreciated from the books, as I think that it speaks for teenage girls' insecurities. A lot of girls think their classmates have this guidebook that tells them how to dress, act, and look perfect, while they inside crumble. Serena is that girl, and on the surface she looks perfect, but she has her demons too. Then there are some other obvious changes, like Jenny's character and appearance, Dan's personality, and Vanessa's ensemble. There were a lot of quirks that were taken out and have resulted in a plain cardboard cutout.

Throughout Gossip Girl's first season, the series strays more and more from the books and in time adapts to its own creation. The real issue is that Gossip Girl lacks a genuine identity, throughout the first 10 episodes every episode revolves around some 'wonderful party', that gets old as we are overwhelmed by this ""privileged lifestyle"" that instead of being shown to us is simply told, or rather listed. Fans complained creator Josh Schwartz copied a lot of plot elements from his previous successful teen drama The O.C. and Gossip Girl lacked originality. While the series at times became cliche, there have always been occasional glimpses of brilliance. Here I take down the 'best' and 'worst' list of episodes of Gossip Girl's first season.

The Best:

Episode 2: The Wild Brunch

Serena realizes she's not welcome, Dan and Chuck almost tear eachother to shreds but good-boy Nate steps in, Jenny becomes engrossed in Blair's lifestyle, and a butler at Bart's brunch gets knocked over in a teenage crossover.

Episode 5: Dare Devil

Alpha-bitch Blair Waldorf invites social climber Jenny Humphrey to her sleepover and sets her up for humiliation. Meanwhile Serena has her first date with Lonely Boy, and Amanda's boyfriend put his tongue in the same mouth that breathes his secret to his girlfriend.

Episode 7: Victor/Victrola

What do you get when you combine a burlesque bar, a Blair ultimatum, Dan's sexual research and Vanessa's jealousy? One pretty damn good episode.

Episode 13: The Thin Line Between Chuck and Nate

Gossip Girl is being flooded by rumors of a pregnant Serena. Meanwhile, Blair's two men fight for their honor, Jenny rises up the social totem pole thanks to newfound friends Penelope and Hazel, and Dan thinks he's in love with Serena. Thinks.

Episode 14: The Blair Bitch Project

Blair, recently de-throned as queen bee forcibly returns for a grueling day at school, but after little Jenny tries to take the throne, Blair puts her best Jimmy Choo forward to face off. The outcome of this schoolyard fight proves this freshman won't go down without a fight.

Episode 16: All About My Brother

In the final battle for Queen Bee, Blair and Jenny face off in the sharpest episode of the season. Meanwhile, Dan sees something he shouldn't have, Rufus and Lilly's romantic life heats up, and two characters reveal their true nature. Also, Georgina Sparks (played brilliantly by Michelle Trachenburg) continues to wreak havoc on Serena's life.

The Worst:

Episode 3: Poison Ivy

Was the choir singing Glamorous by Fergie?! This episode hits a few more speedbumps down the road, and except for the final scene, was really just a filler episode.

Episode 6: The Handmaiden's Tale

For a lame episode centering around some ""glamorous event"", we can watch MTV, thanks. Oh, and the costumes for this episode were... questionable.

Episode 18: Much 'I Do' About Nothing

For a season finale, this episode certainly didn't live up to it's predecessors. Loose ends are tied up way too quickly, Dan pulls the a-hole card, Chuck does a 360 on personality, and Blair plays the little girl that cried tattletale.

Overall, if you enjoyed Mean Girls, or Cruel Intentions, there's something you'll like about Gossip Girl. Though this season was somewhat shaky at times, it's never boring and always is entertaining.
