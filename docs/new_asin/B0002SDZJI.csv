8031267,5,B0002SDZJI,"Magician Jeff Sheridan shows some effective magic tricks that have been known to be excellent effects over the years.  While some of the tricks appear easy and are perhaps well known, his presentations are clear and precise to make the effects easy to understand.  I knew from my first viewing this DVD that his card handling is superior.  This was my first time viewing Mr. Sheridan perform.  While some critics view his performing style as ""dry"", I enjoy his calm presentation demeanor.  This day and age, a lot of folks want razzle and dazzle in presentation styles, but Jeff's approach put me at ease for learning.  I happen to enjoy a clean presentation with simplicity and clarity, which is what this DVD contains.  I believe this to be a fine DVD for the beginning magician.  I applaud Mr. Sheridan because I believe this was his intent.  From what I've read, he's a genius magician and has taught some of the world's top magicians some very advanced card manipulations.  I found his seemingly tailored wardrobe in this DVD to be refreshingly professional as opposed to the blue jeans and T-shirt magicians so common today.  I'm glad I purchased this DVD and I believe others who enjoy watching masterful hands will, as well.",1367107200,,1232,4.791469194312796

8031269,5,B0002SDZJI,"I am surprised by how much I like this beginner's guide to performing magic.  It is a modest, but very pleasant production.  All effects are presented by one talented, low key, and friendly master magician.  One young lady serves as an audience, and as the volunteer whenever one is needed.  Although the tricks appear to be the same, mundane fare offered in many uncounted beginner magic volumes, upon closer inspection it turns out that every ""trick"" presented here is one to three steps better than what might be expected.

I thoroughly enjoyed this instructional DVD, and I learned many useful tips, and techniques that could have taken me years to discover on my own had I not had the editor magician who produced this instructional video working so carefully to teach me only the best effects, and techniques to get me started as a magician.

This is a great guide to the budding magician of any age.  My highest recommendation.

Though meant for beginners...  anyone interested in magic will find this to be a terrific teaching tool.  Watch all of the routines in the ""Show"" mode and enjoy the entertainment. Worth the money.",1138752000,21,280,5.065217391304348
