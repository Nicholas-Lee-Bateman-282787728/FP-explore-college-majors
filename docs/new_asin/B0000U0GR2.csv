periods can tell us a great deal about the culture and people of the time.",1362268800,,200,4.153846153846154
8184788,5,B0000U0GR2,"The lessons are not a professional couple swirling themselves about showing themselves off as a number of dvd dance lessons are tragically.  You can actually learn the steps.  The steps are shown close up, an instructor talks you through it,

and it is slow, piece by piece.

Is this perfect? No.  The demonstrators of those steps, who as I said, are not showing themselves off, are professionals.  This does mean that you have to remind yourself that no one way back then looked like them.  ""Rise up on your knee"" and your shown these feet in very high heels balancing about five inches from the floor effect. Obviously, you're watching ballet dancers, who though they are not performing ballet raise their heels MUCH higher than ourselves or ancestors could ever do.

The biggest problem which is not the fault of the program will be shoes.  The shoes have to be utterly flexible, almost made out of a single layer cloth, with quite a heel.  So that means the student is barefoot rising a heel about two inches at best.  The only pair I could find was a males Irish dance shoe which is a bit much to tinker with the Minuet.

The lessons are good and worthy.  I am pleased and I do recommend it.",1101513600,15,1196,4.506976744186047
