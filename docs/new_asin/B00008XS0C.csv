For instance, the whole opening scene on the lake looks like it was lit with a match.  You cannot make out anything because it's so dark. Just because something is shot at night doesn't mean you don't light the scene!
Even if you like bad z horror movies, I say stay clear of this one.  Buy something like Zombie Bloodbath or Children of the Living Dead.  Those movies are horrible as well, but at least you can see what's going on.",1090195200,7,552,4.372549019607843

There is a lot of badly done day-for-night shooting, the edits are choppy and uneven, the FX and sound are subpar by any standard..
I am a big fan of low budget videos and Fred Olen Ray. This is not without enjoyment,though more of a learning tool than a so bad its good classic..",1086566400,10,458,4.215909090909091

1866558,5,B00008XS0C,"Fred Olen Ray's 1980 film ""The Alien Dead""  is a movie that I've seen on shelves in stores that sell DVDs everywhere since 2005. Every time I saw it there, sitting on the shelf, seven or eight copies all by their lonesome I'd say: ""Today's the day I'm going to buy that movie."" Nine years later, all the major dedicated DVD retailers are almost gone and they certainly don't carry ""The Alien Dead"" anymore, unless it begins with the words ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" which thankfully, ""The Alien Dead"" is a far better film than THAT abomination and that is saying something huge about this little z-grade film from 1980 that I think many of the reviewers on this site have been way too harsh about considering they probably knew what they were getting into when they shelled out the seven or eight bucks this film costs. I assure you, though, if you're into low-budget trash then Fred Olen Ray's ""The Alien Dead"" is totally worth your money.

So, let's have a little breakdown of the film. I won't be delving too deep into spoilers, so don't worry about any major plot points being ruined if you haven't seen it, but if you have seen it, then you'll know what I'm talking about when I drop little hints here and there about some of the more... seemingly esoteric aspects of this peculiar little film.

The first thing in the movie we see is the old, 1970s ""OUR FEATURE PRESENTATION"" graphic, also known (albeit, not officially by any means) as a ""Grindhouse introduction,"" with the upbeat music playing as the words ""Our Feature Presentation"" roll in from all corners on the screen against a colorful background.

Then, quite abruptly, the movie begins. A man sits at his typewriter, narrating as he pecks away at the keys about a 'story that would change this little town, forever.' Already you know the movie is going to be bad-- the picture quality is trash, there's grain everywhere, the film stock looks as though it was recovered from a dumpster in the middle of a hurricane. But that's okay, let's move on. A couple on a row boat is talking about alligators. I think it's supposed to be a ""day for night"" scene, which means when they filmed it, it was the middle of the day, but the scripted scene takes place in the dead of night so special 'filters' were added to dim the scene down to the point of (vaguely) resembling night. This technique was most commonly applied in 1950s monster movies like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and were heavily criticized then for not being dim enough-- but here, the scene is so incredibly dim that we can't even see the faces of the characters-- all we see are their silhouettes against what we can only assume is a sunny July day sky dimmed down to the point that it's an absolutely colorless shade of painfully low glowing light. The couple discusses the ""alligator"" in the swamp and the man pulls a rather large pistol out fires the only realistic gunshot in the film into the water when his wife is pulled into the water by what we can only assume is a zombie.

This is quickly followed by an opening titles sequence that is both surreal and gorgeous-- it really sets a nice tone that, unfortunately will bring up the hopes of younger viewers expecting ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" with zombies, or people who don't understand trashy cinema very well. Regardless of that, this opening titles sequence is GLORIOUS-- we see beautiful paintings of space, planets and meteors floating through space accompanied by some spooky sounding music. It's has a bit of a ""Pod People"" vibe to it, so in watching it, I was already rather delighted in what I was seeing. The title sequence ends.

Now we're dipping our toes into some seriously convoluted plotting because the next thing we see is what I can only assume are college students talking about how the local bass stock is growing to an unusual size. The sheriff stops by to say hello and someone mentions the reconstruction of a local bridge, and asks the sheriff about the ""people's right to know,"" I thought this was foreshadowing something, however it never comes into play again, at least not that I could tell. The sheriff leaves and goes back to the station where he plays a friendly game of poker with his fellow officers when the man who was on the rowboat at the beginning of the movie bursts in, blurting out a story about ""monsters"" grabbing his wife. One of the officers calms him down and takes him to a clinic to get his some tranquilizers to calm down and assures him that they're going to look into the problem. Then, rather abruptly, we cut back to the college student girl from the other scene who is going home. She lets her dog out of the house as she walks into her home, then calls him back, but he's run off. When she goes and looks for him, she suddenly is attacked by a zombie who, instead of eating her, drags her off screen.

It's at this point the movie's focus shifts yet again, now back to the journalist from the beginning of the film, who is in the swamp and meets a nice young lady named Shawn, who's father is a gruff but lovable hillbilly who tells him about the ""big one,"" a, as he puts it, ""giant, mutated gopher"" caused by ""germ warfare during World War I"" from ""the Indians. There are so many anachronisms in his statements that it hurts. The journalist even tries to call him out on some of the inconsistencies and the old guy agrees with him! It's now that I realize that not only does this movie have a serious case of ADHD, switching focal points as if it were channel surfing, but that the writing is so ridiculously poor that it's falling into ""so bad it's AWESOME"" territory. After this, see another woman getting attacked by a zombie (who is a really just a guy with some strawberry syrup on his hands and shirt and wearing a bug-eyed alien mask) and again, instead of eating her, the zombie drags her off screen in the exact same fashion as the first victim. Now I think: ""Oh, maybe we're going somewhere with this? Maybe these zombies don't eat people, maybe they're harvesting them for their alien masters?"" No, this happens a few times, but I've failed to remember that this movie doesn't need to be very complex and it's really just existing for the fun of being a bad movie. I won't give away too much more of the plot, so let's talk about the overall quality of the film.

Some scenes look better than others, in terms of film stock, however, they all seem to have been filmed with an 8mm camera which was poorly blown up to 35mm for its theatrical release. That aside, the gore in the movie has a tendency to be better than worse. A scene that occurs shortly after the previous zombie attack but after the next shows a farmer who has been eaten from the chest, down-- and while it was obviously a simple effect to achieve (they buried half of the actor under dirt and threw some leaves on top and then poured sausage all on top of that) it is highly affective because it looks very real. After that, the journalist and the old hillbilly's daughter are now in love and they go out to the swamp to look for clues when the sheriff and his lovable, overweight deputy show up and insist that all they're going to find out in that swamp is ""some sorta... renegade alligator"" or, as the deputy adds: ""A RENEGATOR!"" Which at this point, I'm doubling over with laughter on my sofa praying this movie never ends.

The unintentional humor is a huge pro when it comes to this movie, however a major con it has is the looping of dialogue that seems to cover almost ninety percent of the characters' lines. Another major con is, despite the movie's budget being very low, it wasn't so low that they couldn't have afforded to shoot some scenes better, like towards the end of the film, the four major characters get in an RV and are driving somewhere, the whole time their dialogue is looped over scenes of the RV driving around various highways and country roads. This scene goes on for about three minutes. There's absolutely no reason they couldn't have filmed inside the RV for this expositional dialogue which not only would have been more ascetically pleasing, but it would have given the actors more face time as well. This is made up by the underwater scenes, which are bizarre as they are beautiful. People in decent zombie makeup are underwater in a real swamp, swimming around as they attack unknowing skinny dippers (who always seen to leave their short shorts jeans on) and pull them under. Complementing this are some well done, if unnecessary slow-motion sequences. But then we get back to the many unexplored ideas the movie hints at but never explains, not because they wanted to leave open ended questions for the viewer to fill in psychologically but because they either ran out of money or were too lazy or incompetent to film the rest. For instance, when the four main characters discover the 'cause' of the zombie pandemic in the swamp, they meet with the woman who was present when the alien goo infected the lake and when she reveals her face after a brief flashback, her face is slightly green and messed up, insinuating that she's infected with the alien pathogen, but not a zombie, or on her way to becoming a zombie. There are several dozen little things like this throughout the movie-- like when the victims of the zombies were dragged off screen earlier in the movie, I thought they were really going somewhere with that, but later in the film, the zombies simply resort to eating their prey-- however there are instances where the zombies do not eat their victims but rather kill them in an assortment of colorful ways that seem unusually complex for these dimwitted but sometimes tool-using ghouls.

All in all, the movie, while in the territory of ""so bad, it's awesome,"" it suffers from extremely poor 'practical' effects, with terrible to nonexistent foley, too many detours and too many unexplored, would-be-interesting ideas. Sometimes horror movies try to offer too much exposition, ruining the mystique behind them, but in this case, there's not nearly enough exposition-- the ending does not even tie in with the opening scene of the journalist typing his story on the typewriter. But, despite all that, the ending left me wanting more and for that, I give it five stars out of five.

The special features on the DVD are extremely limited for a ""25th Anniversary,"" but they include a picture gallery of onset behind the scenes photographs taken during the film's production (which have a far higher picture quality than the film, itself), a 1992 ""reunion"" interview with some of the cast members sharing a few memories about the film-- which they all admit ""is not their finest work, nor is it a good film,"" and a director's commentary by Fred Olen Ray, who admits he doesn't like the movie very much and looking back on it considers it a stain on his career, which is peculiar considering Fred Olen Ray now makes his living directing softcore pornography. He does mention however the idea of someone remaking this movie, which, I think it's ripe for the picking in terms of being remade. Hollywood has a tendency to remake good movies that don't need remakes when they could remake bad movies like ""The Alien Dead"" and make them great films. But I digress. All in all, ""Alien Dead"" is worth your money if you're into trashy, z-grade, low budget zombie movies, so pick it up if you can! It's a great way to pass the time on a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1400889600,5,11441,4.589731051344743

1866560,3,B00008XS0C,"WHEN YOU WATCH A LOW BUDGET FILM MADE FOR AROUND 12,000 DOLLARS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET STAR WARS! Now that I said that I found this low budget film entertaining. It doesn't match the directors latter work in quality, [Fred Olen Ray], but the script was decent and watchable. Buster Crabbe gave a decent performance, and so did the rest of the cast who tried. Granted their acting was a bit rough. It has a good zombies VS us plot. It was fun and watchable like a 1950's style Sci-Fi. But it has a real 70's feeling to it. The soundtrack music was also quite good. When I read the other reviewers comments, it is as if they felt it should look like a million dollar plus film to be good. It won't for that money. It is very easy to say YOU STINK!, and laugh at anthing made cheap. No ultra low budget film will look like Star Wars. For the budget it was a good job.

She was particularly Bad, but So fun to watch as she can barely keep from smiling while she's supposed to be horrified. That to me is the main reason to get a film like this. Of course it's not Romero. DUH. You want Romero, go watch Romero, this is an example of getting a movie made,when you really don't have the money to make it. But you go ahead and do it regardless!

1866565,2,B00008XS0C,"Normally I am a big fan of cheap, cheesy 1970s horror films, especially if they take place in swamps and star aging has-beens.  So you'd think I'd love this film.  Nope.  For one thing it is too self-conscious: it actually TRIES to be funny but isn't.  For another thing, whatever redeeming qualities the first half of the film may have, by the time you get to the second half it is so repetitious that it become extremely plodding.  And there is no payoff at the ending because THE FILM HAS NO ENDING!  Somehow Ray forgot to give the film either any sense of resolution or some sort of shock.  I'd settle for even for a poorly done shock.  But no, the film just ends when it could have similarly ended after the first 25 minutes.

Even worse, the prologue Ray added to the beginning of the movie some time after he finished filming and everyone had gone home manages to make the non-ending even more of a non-ending.  Now THAT was an accomplishment!",1097712000,4,950,4.4393063583815024

7987823,5,B00008XS0C,"I think this is a highly underrated low-budget classic. They really don't make retro feeling stuff like this anymore. It's one of those films that has a unique retro style film quality that has never been equaled. There's only a little topless nudity, and the gore in the film isn't extreme or abundant; it's limited to certain scenes. It isn't for those looking for a gorefest that's loaded with action. It's for those who are looking for a flick with an extreme retro low-budget feel, which is one of the best things about it. The simple story that doesn't require you to pay attention is about a meteor that kills and re-animates a bunch aboard a boat at night. The locations are basically isolated with woodlands and swamps, which is a perfect place to make the film. I personally have always thought it was well scored with odd and eerie soundtracks as well. The locations, music and grindhouse retro style make it a great late night flick. I thought it has a bizarre, drug induced type retro film style to it in certain sections; I guess that might be a good way to describe it in some parts. I didn't think it was slow because the style and locations kept me watching, but the zombie attacks are spaced out. If you don't like its really retro style, then you won't like it. Some will classify it as a flick that's so bad it's good, while others won't like it at all. Others, like myself, will just like how it was made and will watch it again and again.

The quality on the Blu-ray is so much better than my old Retromedia DVD. Obviously, it isn't quite as razor sharp as many other Blu-ray films because of its cheapness, but I thought it looked great. Color, contrast and brightness are excellent. If you're a fan of the film, you need this Blu-ray to see it properly. The menu screen has a little bit of animation and has music, but there're no chapter stops. However, you get 2 short flicks for extras. One is a black and white movie called THE BRAIN LEECHES. The quality on this one is pretty bad. It's basically at a PG-rated level with no gore or nudity. Not much happens during the entire thing, but it's rare and may be worth a look for bad movie fans or some collectors. The other one runs under a half hour and is G-rated garbage called THE HALLOWEEN PLANET. This kid and his sister leave home on a spaceship and land somewhere. They then go to this castle and Dracula is there along with other characters. They talk and do basically nothing and then the kids leave again on their ship. The picture quality on this one looks pretty decent. If you like THE ALIEN DEAD, the excellent quality along with those 2 extras make it a great disc to buy. There's also an audio commentary on those 2 extra flicks, as well as THE ALIEN DEAD. Other extras are an ALIEN DEAD still gallery, a cast reunion, and a VHS cover gallery. The VHS cover gallery plays with a commentary by Fred. It shows all the various VHS covers of THE ALIEN DEAD from all over the world.",1484611200,6,2968,4.406193078324226

Fast forward to when the DVD was released and I am older, very into low budget films and I (against my better judgement) enter the digital era of this films history of release's and I was surprised that I liked it, even sitting through the DVD commentary.

Fast Forward Part Two (Electric Boogaloo) : Fred Olen Ray announced that the Blu-Ray of 1000 copies signed by him will be available for sale on Amazon.  Two weeks later, I am ordering this edition for my growing Blu-Ray collection.

The print of the film looks a little better on certain parts, according to the new Blu-Ray commentary, they found sections from the first strike when looking for the film elements of this film.  Sadly, the original negative and other film elements are LOST.  At times this print looks great other times like the quality the VHS copy was.

This edition has the new transfer, new commentary, bonus feature The Brain Leeches (Black and White, 1977 and full frame), this is Fred's first movie and it has a commentary track.  This also has his unaired Halloween special (also with commentary).  If there are Easter eggs on this version of the movie I have not found them.

Please note, the acting, is non existent.  The camera work is non existent and this is a film that the horror world either missed it or just ignored. Through all that,  I somehow learned to love this quirky clunker. This is why I give this film five stars, if this is not your type of film, you will feel it may deserve one or two stars.

So, if you are daring, plunk down the money and enjoy this craptastic masterpiece or be one those who go, meh, and find this boring and looking for the 75 minutes you wasted looking at Alien Dead!  Hey, even Fred Olen Ray rips on this film in the commentary.  :)",1481846400,8,1924,4.485632183908046
