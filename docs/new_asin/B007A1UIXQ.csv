5071390,4,B007A1UIXQ,"Winners are born not made. This was the line in my head before watching the Klitschko brothers' story. Knowing nothing about them, this is the ideal dvd to follow their journey from kick-boxing youngsters to Heavyweight champions. The line which came to me whilst watching was: theirs is an untidy story. A unique boxing story but also a typical post-Soviet experience. Talent had to flee.

As a documentary it could have used a lot more pace and ditched the fancy camera shots and brooding music track. I was fascinated by the German connection, they speak German as well as Russian (I trust the sub titles for that information) and the corrupt Ukranian political situation. Even the Chernobel disaster was well covered.

I sensed that once again a boxing story is so dependent on the skill and honesty of those closest to the boxer. Trainers and Managers. Apart from the aversion to Don King and the comment on a trainer that: 'he knows my body better than my wife!' this side of the story is not delved into.

I was particularly pleased to hear the question about them boxing each other was left to near the end. The relationship between the two brothers is clearly two rail tracks on the same line. A loving mother and the caring, disciplined father. Rock steady feet.

I threw the dvd into my shopping basket at the local supermarket now that it is on the discount shelves, I recommend the story of two men who reached the top of the mountain. Boxing at its best is a way out and a way in. Well played both brothers.",1357776000,,1521,4.580882352941177
5071391,5,B007A1UIXQ,"My husband and I love ""good"" boxing, and the Klitschos are our favorites.  This DVD covers their history, including their upbringing, successes and failures.  If you are a boxing fan and know of the Klitschko brothers, this DVD won't disappoint you.",1356566400,2,249,5.048780487804878
5071392,5,B007A1UIXQ,"An excellent film, not only regarding the world of boxing - but family honor, self respect, awareness and integrity.  Definitely worthy of sharing with young people trying to get a grasp on the world (and the spoiled ones who need direction).  Good to know there ARE some good people still moving forward with kindness and a sense of family - which Americans are getting confused with.  Just buy it!",1355270400,4,399,4.753623188405797
5071393,5,B007A1UIXQ,"i was so surprised seeing this film that it held my attention for the duration.  its not just a story about the sport of boxing, its also so much more.  its a story about family, overcoming adversity, breaking down stereotypes, making your own way, setting and attaining goals, and being a good role model.  great message, some funny anecdotal background about the former soviet ideology and propaganda, maybe what we take too much for granted today.  definitely a must see and for more than just boxing fans.",1354838400,2,509,4.816091954022989
5071394,5,B007A1UIXQ,"This is a great film. It's especially moving when you consider that Emmanuel Stewart has passed. These are real people who are pushing the capabilities of the Human Spirit and Potential to the maximum. Expertly crafted technically, with great cinematography and editing. The Klitschko Brothers demonstrate an extraordinary level of discipline and strength, while surrounding themselves with people who are filled with humor, humility and the desire to be legendary. It's an awesome movie that is worthy of multiple viewings. It's Rocky but Real Life.",1353715200,,550,5.482352941176471

5071399,5,B007A1UIXQ,"What a moving documentary!  Just like the athlete, this film has so much heart...the heart of two champions, in fact.  You don't have to be a boxing fan to love ""Klitschko.""  It hit me on several fronts: humor, danger, frustration, sadness, yearning, and ultimately triumph!  The boxing had me on the edge of my seat, and some scenes sent cold shivers throughout my body.  What amazes me the most is that I knew almost nothing about these two great fighters--these two great men!.  If you ever go through hard times and you want to just throw in the towel, STOP!  Watch this film to see how it's done...how to get back on your feet.  Their exciting history would have escaped me if not for this...one of the best documentaries ever made.  While the boxing was exciting, the importance of love between two brothers and their parents is even more inspiring. I loved this treasure!",1443571200,,878,4.64935064935065

From their upbringing and to their rise to dominance and the hurdles and setbacks, just an incredible story all around. One of my favorite films.",1426464000,,292,4.327272727272727
5071417,5,B007A1UIXQ,"Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko proved to be the worlds greatest heavyweight boxing brothers, and the documentary of their lives to date portrays remarkable drive and skill to be the best. Yet the guidance of their family helped shape the brothers to be intelligent and respectful boxers. Family values also propelled them both above any financial gains the sport has to offer, and with a dedicated group of trainers representing several countries Vitali and Wladimir have earned their places as two of the best boxers of their era.

5071419,5,B007A1UIXQ,"Documentary film makers, certainly of the ""sports"" variety, watch this movie and pay close attention to how one makes one of these extremely well. This wasn't an average movie about sports stars or a fun diversion, this was documentary film making as an art form. It was funny, intense, warm and heartfelt, and consistently interesting from open to close. I used to follow boxing years ago and knew that the name Klitschko was synonymous with a serious boxer, but this movie showed how clever, devoted, and... let's be honest... adorable these two fellows are.

I'm glad someone took the time to make such a well crafted introduction to their journey as boxers and let me enjoy their lives for a moment.",1423526400,,703,4.809917355371901

5071423,5,B007A1UIXQ,Very very well presented! Their story shown dating back from when they were young boys which includes the way they were raised by their military father and loving mother whom the brothers would do anything for. You find them both strong willed for all the right reasons including when they resisted signing with promoter Don King (hard to do I'm sure) and when Vladimir went his own way without his brother to train. It was both informative and very entertaining.,1397606400,,463,4.8

I do not like boxing and had never heard of the Klitschko brothers, despite that, the movie caught and kept my interest. The film portrays such an amazing story about a family and their perseverance to pursue a passion. The fact that the film starts in the old USSR makes it that much more interesting and enthralling.",1388275200,,382,4.632352941176471

to send to a friend who, believe it or not, is in the movie. While searching Amazon, I must have pushed the wrong button, because I apparently purchased the ""video on demand"". That is useless to me. I don't seem to be able to cancel that order. The lesson is, when on Amazon, be REALLY CAREFUL what buttons you push. I was screwed.",1384041600,,448,4.1022727272727275

5071432,4,B007A1UIXQ,"Good movie. Wish we got more of their present day life (at the time) included. The credits were hilarious!!!
The still or slow motion shots of punches make me cringe. Not for the person being bit, but for the Klitschkos and the faces they make putting so much effort into those hits.",1367884800,,283,4.461538461538462
5071433,5,B007A1UIXQ,"This documentary was filmed with the HIGHEST definition I have ever had the pleasure of focusing my eyeballs on in a theater, which justified my purchase of it on Blu-ray (rather than DVD) even though I don't have a BR player of my own.  The quality of the picture makes every scene fun to look at, whether it's a sweeping shot of the Ukrainian desert or a close-up, slow-motion sequence of an ear-rippling left jab to the face.
To go along with the excellent visual quality of Klitschko is a superbly-told story that defines a good documentary: one that makes you passionate about a subject that you cared little about beforehand.  Yes, it's boxing. No, I'm not a boxing fan. However, Sebastian Dehnhardt's intimate treatment of his two subjects Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko in and out of the boxing ring lends an emotional impact with every punch the brothers throw and receive, and leaves you searching your cable provider's pay-per-view selection for ""Klitschko"" to see when the next fight is... (May 4th in Mannheim, fyi).

Bottom line: Great story, exciting slow-motion boxing action, and the most stunning visuals of any documentary feature I've seen yet... If you are looking for a great film on Blu-ray to showcase your new Ultra-HD screen, this is it!
