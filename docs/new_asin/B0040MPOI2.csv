4240628,4,B0040MPOI2,"""Unlocking the Mystery of life"" and ""Privileged Planets"" are much more interesting to watch than this DVD. ""DNA by design"" DVD is a Stephen C. Meyer's lecture. So, the only person you would see on your screen is him (well and Chuck Missler in second part sitting at the table). There were a few illustrations and one DNA animation. The rest is just a talk. They could make an audio disk instead. Stephen C. Meyer brought many arguments in favor of Intellect Design. And tried to prove that life did not happened by chance. However, since DVD title is DNA by design I expected to see more information on how exactly the DNA mechanism works: what exactly moves molecules from one mini lab to another. Just a random or even coded electromagnetic field attractions would not provide all passes of building protein blocks. When to start and end the process, how long the one piece of molecule code waits for another molecule to come and join first one in building chain, what mechanism defines the adequacy and sufficiency of building molecules, what mechanism ""decides"" that block is complete and disengage ready to go new formed molecule block, what forces direct this molecule to another step of processing and so on? The mechanism what handle the sequence of building molecules blocks was not revealed. It was just given for a fact. And again there was a lack of animation. It looked like his goal was only to bring in a front of audience some facts which would point on presence of intelligence in DNA.
The second part was divided on two parts: answering the audience questions (by the way I never saw one or heard a questions) and then interview with Chuck Missler (you can Google him, he is like lector in some Church). What I didn't like is when Mr. Missler started to quote Bible, and the whole thing of Intellectual Design ""started shifting"" in my eyes toward another fair tale like the Bible. Mr. Meyer mentioned several times that he is a Christian and else he is an atheist. How is that can be? He mentioned also that ""...we can see in DNA presence of God's mind..."". Now, when you are saying like that, Mr. Meyer, you better start to define what do you mean under God. If this is a Biblical one then your theory of Design stops right there. If you have another definition then you better call it by another name, 'cause God is the word what was occupied by religions. There is no science there but only speculations. If you meant something like Intelligent system then you should give your opinion (at least) on what is it, what its consist of, what are its tools and what its motives?
Lets say: Ok, we are all designed. Then what? What exactly did we have to do with that? Start another worship to new Intelligent God of our imaginary? The reason why through time there were progressive ideas and finally science break through is that because people was not fanatically believers, what would restrict their thoughts by Biblical forbiddings. I do not want that pressure from fanatics and mind restriction neither from old nor from any new religions. That would bring us eventually to the dark ages. The other case would be if you just saw something and told the others. But in amount of others there are people who not just see the beauty of design but actually trying to uncover the secrets of DNA codes building on this base new medicine, new type of computers. People doing something good with that not just lecture others meeting baptists from another Church. Everybody looking for truth. No one should stop on one brilliant idea worshiping it to the rest of his days because this would be a dead end of intelligence.
By the way, just because living things were created (lets assume so) it does not point at some God mystery. We create robots. Are we Gods? Give it an artificial intellect and they will create their own Gods along with many other explanations of everything's existence. That what we probably are - biological machines very much programmable with imposed (or made out of an idea) programs. Even emotions are program based on IF - THEN simple logic. But maybe because some machine created living things it does not have fillings or necessity to care or hear all of us. The mechanism of life was started, that's it. And since a brain activity is electromagnetic impulses it's easy to assume a transmission between person and machine-creator (of cause it would be just a tool) for gathering an experience of individuals to build better program. Where is it - this ""machine""? It might be hidden from our barbarian world. Anyway this is the same speculation as an Intelligent design on what and how everything was made. And since there is no solid evidences all kind of theories will stay as theories.

I liked the logic and collection of some arguments on this DVD though. But anyway DVD could be done better with more graphic more samples, may be some music and narrations.",1304640000,18,4899,4.670138888888889

4240654,5,B0040MPOI2,"EXTREMELY powerful information! Some don't realize that there is a layer of evidence entirely over-and-above that for Irreducible Complexity which testifies on behalf of an Intelligent Designer. Specified Complexity is just as mind-blowing, and its improbability is even more precisely calculable. Once I found out that there are literally hundreds of quadrillions of computers within the cells in our bodies communicating with one another (some using triple layers of encryption!), the question that came to my mind was ""Why in the @#$ is Darwinism still being taught?!""
