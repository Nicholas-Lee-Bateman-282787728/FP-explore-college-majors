3572537,3,B001FB55I0,"While giant explosions and wildly intense action scenes are eclipsed by even larger sequences of mass destruction, the story of Terminator Salvation remains timidly simple.  No tricky time travel finds its way into the plot, but perhaps such complexities are exactly what's missing - the loss of interaction between something completely alien and the familiar conventions of our world coupled with the contrast of futuristic terror and the limited resources of present day leave a premise dull by comparison.  Though it may be nearly impossible to match the integrity of the first two entries in the franchise, Salvation should realize that bigger sizes and quantities of killer robots doesn't necessarily make them scarier.

The year is 2018 and the war between man and machine rages on.  Skynet continues to build larger and more powerful weapons, including increasingly advanced Terminators.  When the Resistance, led by John Connor (Christian Bale), uncovers a secret code embedded in the enemy's communications, an offensive is planned that may allow a crippling strike to the machines' headquarters.  Teaming up with mysterious stranger Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), Connor must race against time to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and protect the future of mankind.

Terminator Salvation is as dark and serious as The Dark Knight, except that there is no Joker - or any character we can follow with white-knuckle enthusiasm. There's little humor to break up the unrelenting suspense and detonative violence, resulting in an entertainingly bleak post-apocalyptic action fest with fleeting genuine fun. The machines are bigger, more destructive and less advanced, but not more terrifying. They aren't the cleverly infiltrated assassins that wowed audiences in the original two films, but lifeless automatons that only present dilemmas when an action sequence requires it. The intelligence and mercilessness of the machines, once admirable when personified by Schwarzenegger, is only matched by the humans in a constant struggle to blur the lines between good and evil; the Resistance in Salvation is unable to avoid becoming like the new enemy.

Plenty of extra characters allow for more casualties, battles, carnage, showdowns, firepower, bloodshed (minus the blood) and apathetic adventure - there's little heart to any of it. It is action for the sake of action; stunts and thrilling fight sequences take precedence while the story merely serves to tie them together. It's a fresh setting, grittier and intense from cutting edge camerawork, mind-blowing sound effects and visuals, with interior designs like Aliens and exterior locations like The Road Warrior. But the story doesn't advance any of the characters, nor does it inform us of unfamiliar aspects. By the end, nothing has changed, and all we've witnessed is glorified Terminator and human warfare. It's a giant, unending battle with no hope for solid resolution or events that can change Judgment Day lore - it's an episode that doesn't greatly impact or alter what James Cameron so revolutionarily created.

3572538,4,B001FB55I0,"I terminated 2.5 hours of my overcast afternoon to get to and wait in line for the sneak preview of Terminator Salvation, so I figured that I might as well try to get my review up tonight to help people make an informed, spoiler-free decision this weekend. I know I waited about the length of movie in line, but I did walk into it knowing what to expect and I got exactly that: a summer blockbuster action movie.

The plot is basically what you think it is given the plots of the first two movies (the third one doesn't really count in the continuum of this movie's timeline, from what I remember of it). In the future, the government contracts Skynet for defense technologies, which creates robots that end up becoming self-aware and decide that humanity is a threat on ""Judgement Day"" and start trying to destroy the entire human population. Unlike the first two movies, which take place because robots from the future travel back in time, this one takes place in the middle of the war with John Connor right in the middle of the resistance as they prepare to attack Skynet. If I tell you any more than that then it would spoil what little there is to be spoiled (but the trailer does spoil quite a bit).

It's really easy to pick apart this movie. Let's face it: it's a hardcore action movie. No one is going to see it for quotable dialogue. Sadly, you never really connect to the characters so you don't care much about them. Character development is slim-to-nil, even with the leading role of Christian Bale as John Connor. Some of the supporting characters give predictably weak performances, most notably Common (although he is very good at hip hop). The only characters I ever felt myself caring about were Sam Worthington's and Moon Bloodgood's. I'm not even going to get into the scientific impossibilities or inconsistencies in the movie, or its strange idea of time (which differs with Lost and Star Trek). Of course, no one is going to this movie for a character study though or scientific accuracy, so to critique those points would be dumb. You're really going because you want to see evil robots trying to kill people.

You will definitely see a lot of that. Those robots get pretty creepy, so if the robot apocalypse scares you excessively then this is definitely not the movie for you. Seriously, the robots are creepy, and there are some startling moments (not a whole lot, just a few). I definitely don't think the movie is appropriate for any kids younger than 13 (though I think even 15 is kind of pushing it). There's no sex or excessive gore, but there's plenty of violence and the robots are eerie. The dystopian future it paints can just be a lot to handle for a young teenager.

Anyway, the action is definitely stellar. There's also a lot of it. It reminds me of Mission: Impossible 3 since the breaks between action scenes are few and far between, and each action scene is ridiculously intense and has you very anxious. I have to admit that it's a bit of a stressful movie to watch after a full day of work, but it's still fun. The only criticism I can viably make about the action is that at times the characters didn't seem sufficiently scared about the situations they found themselves in, but I could believe that they live in a world where the stuff that happens in this movie just doesn't phase them anymore because they've been totally desensitized to it.

I was sitting in the very front of the theater and I didn't notice any crummy CG. Whatever CG they had was actually pretty believable. They do an incredible job of creating a world and a reality that you believe could happen. I seriously found myself pondering what I'd do to deal with the robot apocalypse at points in this movie. I really wished they took it a step farther and covered a little bit further some of the ethical/logistical issues they touched upon with regard to robots rather than skirting them or handling them awkwardly, but I knew that it really wasn't that kind of movie.

Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not the pretentious film critic who's going to give this movie an F just because it wasn't the best movie of the year. Sure it didn't measure up to Watchmen or Star Trek, but it was a solid action movie. We live these super busy lives where we don't take a whole lot of time to stop and just rest and enjoy something, and I think that Terminator Salvation, ironically enough, gives us something to enjoy as a fun experience. Assuming that you don't think you're going to have nightmares about the robot apocalypse, I definitely recommend seeing this movie while it's in theaters. I've seen better action movies so I have to give it a solid B-, but I still think it's a very worthwhile B movie.",1242604800,108,4723,4.563679245283019
3572539,5,B001FB55I0,well gee i guess it should come as no surpise that terminator 4 did not deliver what it said it would. we where promised big battle scenes just like star trek promised big space battles and guess what their is no battle scenes big surpise ( there were no space battles in star trek ether) I guess hollywood is clueless as to what people want to see in movies nowadays if you are going in this movie expecting to see big battle scenes then trust me you will be very very very very and i do me very disappointed. thank god for japanese anime they make the kind of movies that i like to see.,1242000000,,588,4.121739130434783
3572540,4,B001FB55I0,"This is what ive been hoping for all these years.... HEAVY METAL WAR! To finally see the battles of John Connor will face as we been told in the previous installments. Of-course we all know this takes place after the events of T3 with the world, well you know. Humans being outnumbered and rounded up like cattle into slavery to build machines for SKYNET. After reading alot on the net and seeing it for myself on every trailer, we see John Connor and his wife Kate fulfilling their destiny as mankind's only hope for survival by leading the resistenceto victory. Two people we will encounter is a young Kyle Reese who any fan would remember from the first film and who protected Sarah Connor and conceived John with her. the other is  decommissioned Terminator who has secret that i don't want to spoil but questions about him are asked if he was sent from the future or was saved from the past. I know theres nay sayers who will say this will flop because it's James cameron's baby and he's still not involved, and because theres rumors about a PG-13 rating. and if it comes to that, i read already there will be a R-rated Director's cut on dvd. All depends on the director and the studio,but im sure we won't be let down. one thing that gives me confidence with the film is Arnold in a way is involved and Linda Hamilton is back for voice-overs at the beginning and end of the film. voice-overs used for tapes Sarah made for John while she was pregnant warning him about his future and destiny. the cast looks great, im not familiar with the MCG's work as director but he sounds like he's takin the franchise's future seriously not just for this film but two more if this one is a success which im hoping for. Bottom line is i cant wait for May 21st to come.",1237680000,4,1761,4.401840490797546

3572643,5,B001FB55I0,"Arguably one of the best entries into the Terminator franchise.  The cast is well assembled: Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, Michael Ironside, etc.

This film takes place in the future and remains there - no jumbled time paradoxes, just a straight forward story of Man vs A.I. after the bombs fell.  The film is positioned as a side-story, a way to explain, perhaps, the experimentation that led to the mostly-machine Terminator played by Arnold.

In the end, it's not a story focused on the main franchise characters - yes, John Connor is present; yes, Kyle Reese is present; but ultimately the protagonist of the film is a character previously unknown played by Sam Worthington.  Worthington is a death-row convicted killer who signs his body over for scientific research.  While he is in some liminal state between life and death, he awakens in the post-apocalyptic world.  It is only a short while before he discovers he is no longer fully human, and the story provides a path of redemption for Worthington's character, never belonging to the time, to humanity, or to even the machine world.

The movie is rather well done and I certainly recommend giving it a viewing.",1507334400,,1189,4.939698492462312

3572694,2,B001FB55I0,"Christian Bale's talents come to waste in this borefest that just 8 years since its release has been left in the forgotten movie shelf. Long, tedious and utterly confusing, it has a hard time between choosing to be a military film where John Connor was teleported to an apocalyptic Earth that is too much like Mad Max and not enough robots.

Skynet is either the name of John's spaceship or its the villain. The movie made so little sense that I have a hard time discerning which of the two it was. The film has some good actors but some huge plot holes as well.

***SPOILER BELOW!***

If robots are so much superior to humans and have pretty much won the war, why would they invest so many resources into creating cyborg robots with fake human flesh to infiltrate human cities but then erase their memories that they are in reality Trojan horses? Why go through so many hurdles when they have space-time warping technology and liquid metal Terminators that take infinite shapes and then create a more tedious and inferior kind of Terminator that can't even alert other Terminators where the other surviving humans are?",1494633600,,1119,4.698979591836735

Yes, there are inconsistencies come on now look at the X-men series when your dealing with time alternates this is going to happen but overall this was super fun.

Bad plot!!!! We have yet another incarnation of John Connors from 1984, 1991, 2003.... confusing. If that was not bad enough boring plot, which does not have any direction ....this should have been the final movie and then they should have shown the audience how it will end the war.....it keeps us hanging again......

Well the 2 stars only my like and admiration for Christian Bale, his screen time wasted and underutilized!!!!!",1470960000,,698,4.957264957264957
3573029,3,B001FB55I0,"Christian Bale uses his annoying Batman voice for most of the movie.

And some significant plot points don't  make sense. Why capture Kyle Reese? The machines tried to kill John Connor. They tried to kill his mother. But when they find his *father*, they don't try to kill him.

Also, making a terminator from a regular person doesn't make sense. Adding a chip to his brain makes sense, but putting mechanical parts in his arms and legs is stupid. It defeats the purpose. The result is too much like a regular terminator and hardly better at blending in.

Oddly, he passes as human well enough that other terminators spend most of the movie trying to kill him  which is a huge flaw in Skynet's master plan.

How is he supposed to infiltrate the resistance if another terminator blows him to bits?

Also, I doubt you can save a stabbing victim with a heart transplant. Heart transplants are always given to people with diseased or deformed hearts, not injuries.

People who have been stabbed or shot wouldn't survive long enough for the transplant to be completed. Otherwise, doctors would already be doing it in real life.

They really should have stopped this series after part two because the sequels are too dependent on the backstory from the first movie, which is weak.

A computer destroys the world? Stupid. You risk blowing yourself up. Plus computers need electricity, and electricity is made by *people*.

Also, the all-important savior idea is dumb. People are replaceable. If you killed John Connor, someone would replace him a minute later.

I didn't really question this stuff during the first movie because the future is not the movie's focus. It's focused on 1984. ""The Terminator"" is like a science fiction version of ""Halloween."" They're both about a woman getting chased by a seemingly unstoppable killer.

The terminator is basically Michael Myers.

The first movie glosses over the story's weaknesses, but each sequel draws my attention to them.",1470960000,,1966,4.918181818181818

If you like things that go boom, some action, and a post nuclear apocalypse world I say give it a watch. This movie is visually astonishing. That's about as far as it goes. This isn't a good follow up to the classic James Cameron's first 2 Terminator movies. Terminator Salvation doesn't deliver on John Connor's fight for survival in the future was against the machines. It introduces that very concept then strays away to focus on a new character in the terminator series Marcus Wright. John seems to do more damages than good and everything makes me scratch my head and ask, ""whaaaaaaaaaaaat?"" It's a let down. It's not deep and has no strong character development at all. There's a really cool part in the beginning with John in a helicopter accident. The movie is almost worth that scene.",1455667200,,872,4.705882352941177
3573259,3,B001FB55I0,"Christian Bale and Sam Worthington, especially, aided and abetted by the supporting cast, and no doubt as directed by McG, take themselves way too seriously in this film. This is realism on steroids - film directors and actors forgetting that everything they do is make-believe. I mean, when I watch a movie I like to be transported to another place just like everyone else, but let's not lose our grip on reality in the process. Great effort was made to make every scene realistic (props, etc.) while pretending to ignore simple realities. For instance, in this film the human resistance in the city of Los Angeles amounts to two people, a teenage boy and a preadolescent girl. This is supposed to be representative of the worldwide state of affairs. Nevertheless, in this film the human resistance employs high performance jet aircraft and submarines against the ""machines"". It takes a small army of highly trained and disciplined people to maintain such equipment, and secure bases of operation from which to deploy them, and a teen boy and a little girl don't qualify as sufficient recruits for such army.

But the most glaring deficiency of this film is the intensity the actors bring to their work. I mean, let's be intense about things like Shakespeare, that is, while fictional, is so close to reality as to almost be confused with it. There is nothing close to reality about machines taking over the world in 2016 (yes, 2016, as depicted this film). The actors needed to back off a little bit and laugh at themselves and this fantasy they were producing. As Tom Selleck once said, ""acting is not curing cancer"".",1455321600,,1620,4.827338129496403

3573350,2,B001FB55I0,"I pretty much despise this film.  I had high hopes when I originally heard about the storyline.  Then I heard the movie was going to be PG-13 and my heart sank.  Right then and there I knew this film was going to suck.  PG-13 for a Terminator movie!!! Not R rated!!!! What's next Termintor with Care Bears and Rainbow Bright.  Seriously WB/Columbia Pictures or whatever movie studio made this crap.  Upon seeing the movie my fears were indeed correct.  The movie throws out all the rules they already established from the first 3 films.  What happened to humans only being able to move around at night.  Where are all the hunter killers, how come we don't see these waste disposal camps in large areas around the world.  Where are the dam* ray guns and futuristic weapons?

For as bad as Terminator 3 was which is actually great compared to this film.  T3 did progress the story to the start of the war.  In this film it is like the war is not even going on.  I so wanted to see the desolate wasteland future portrayed at the beginning of T2 and see the human struggle how they turn the tide.  We don't get to see Christian Bale triumphantly breaking humans out of the camps or showing the survivors how to ambush and destroy the T-800s and make it into Skynet.  I was expecting to see T-800's in droves and actual battle scenes.  This movie is another middle of the road film.  At least they don't go back in time again that is getting old as well.

This is the classic case of Hollywood running a movie franchise into the ground.  Aliens, Star Wars, Rocky, Predator, all were great original movies and have gotten worse and worse with each sequel.  Christian Bale is ok in this film, but I though the film would have been better off with an unknown actor to play the part of John Conner.  No Terminator movie should ever be PG-13 that should be downright criminal.  The next Terminator movie will be like the A-Team 10,000 rounds fired with nobody getting hurt or dying.  I have not seen Terminator Genisys so I can't review it yet.  Terminator Salvation just flat out sucks and does nothing with the story its just a middle ground movie made to get unsuspecting action movie fans to waste their hard earned money.  Like Rocky 5 this film should have been scrapped on the drawing board and never went into production.  I would give it 1 star but Sam Worthington did a decent job.

 I miss the good old fashioned ""R"" rating for adults.  It's like the studios have no balls anymore and are just looking for the widest audience possible to make the biggest profit at the expense of the movies themselves.  News flash if the movie is ""R"" rated and good you will still sell more tickets than that cream puff PG-13 movie.  Now watch all the Terminator fanboys thrash my review on sight.

3573719,4,B001FB55I0,"When I watched the third Terminator movie a couple of weeks ago, I felt like it was beginning to feel old, familiar, and predictable.  Still, that movies ending, I was curious to see how the story would advance in the next film, Terminator: Salvation.  I was surprised to find they told a different kind of story in the familiar world of the franchise, and I liked the movie for that.

For the first time, the entire movie takes place in the post-apocalyptic future, aka 2018.  John Connor (Christian Bale) is leading the resistance, or at least part of the resistance, in Los Angeles.  While on a mission, he uncovers a device that might lead to the complete destruction of SkyNet.  And the timing couldn't be better since a new hit list has just come out with John as number two.  Number one?  A teenager named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).

Tests of this new weapon are proving to be successful, but theres a complication.  Destroying SkyNet might also mean the destruction of Kyle.  John now needs to find a way to save his father, and he might have to rely on the most unlikely of sources for that help.

While we have seen glimpses of the future in the past movies, this is the first time weve spent much time there.  That alone was a nice change of pace since we can now see the future weve been hearing about and dreading.  Normally, Im not a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, so the fact that I was ready to explore this world says something about the franchise.

Another change that I liked was the fact that we didn't spend the entire movie running from terminators.  Yes, that aspect of the franchise was still there, but it wasn't the focus of the movie.  Instead, the focus was taking the battle to SkyNet while still preserving the past.  Plus we get a bit about the power struggle happening inside the resistance.

The thing we do still get are wonderful action scenes.  They had me glued to the screen since so much was happening so quickly I couldn't keep track of it any other way.  Was what we saw possible?  Probably not.  But it was so well done I really didn't care.  The special effects were wonderful as always for the franchise, too.

The one flaw I can see in the movie is the lack of character development.  I know, thats not usually a strong point in an action movie, but it is a flaw again here.  The only character I truly felt connected to was John Connor, and that was because this is the fourth movie telling his story.  Even then, he could have been a stronger character.

Not that Im blaming the actors.  They do a great job with the material they have.  Its the script that could have been stronger.

Speaking of actors, there is a noticeable absence in this film.  When the movie was made, Arnold Schwarzenegger was busy being the governator here in California, so the brief appearances of his face in the film are all CGI.

Weak characters aside, I still loved Terminator: Salvation because it told a new story in the world we already know.  Like the rest of the franchise, its a fun ride, so pop it in, sit back, and enjoy.",1440374400,,3060,4.4522522522522525

 What can be said for a film culture which insists upon the certainty of a sequel to the adventure of a new idea?  Of the six top scoring movies this weekend, five are sequels.  That said, boy is Terminator Salvation a good sequel.
 Some have criticized the convoluted story line, with time sequences garbled beyond understanding.  Some have criticized the lack of characters one can bond with, save of course Christian Bale as John Connor.  I say pish, if we wanted an understandable story, we wouldnt have put in so many explosions, and more explosions, and ever bigger explosions.  This is a genuine explosion fest.
 Bale is certainly one of the most intense actors working today.  He is the only big star in the film, if you don't count the special effects guys.  He is just enough and has just enough to do to make this a cut above the Fast and Furious films.
 He is supported by Sam Worthington in a fine role as a re-built human.  The wonderfully named Moon Bloodgood shows how to play it both tough and tender.  Both of them are now marked on directors want lists.
 Director McG proves that he can handle a $200 million action flick with the best of them.  He directed both Charlies Angles films and We Are Marshall.  His street credibility has increased.
 Terminator Salvation came in second to Night at the Museum but still clipped $43 million from the $224 total box office over the weekend.  This film pushed the Terminator franchise to number four and insures that there will be a number five.
 The PG-13 (movie violence, mostly done to machines) movie rates a respectable three and a half saw blades.  Fans will like it.  Be sure to watch for a brief cameo by Arnold himself.",1438387200,,1711,4.614617940199335

He has background, depth of character, and is faced with the true burden in the movie.  As for the ending of the movie, the discarded ending, which is referenced online and in the Blu-ray version is much more fascinating ending with John being killed by Marcus who assumed his face.

The trailer didn't do the film justice and I was kind of annoyed that they were replacing the actor of John Connor again. However, years later, I finally watched it and I will admit I was very wrong to snub this film off for so long. It really does the series justice and brings a lot of the elements from the previous three films together. On top of that it brings continuity to the series not just for the big things but even the little things including the scar on Connor's face that we see in flash-forwards in both the second and third films. The actor that plays the young Kyle Reese also does a fantastic job. Micheal Beine is such a great actor and the young kid does him proud--not only looking like he could very well be a younger version of him but hitting all the right notes and tones of the character. If you love the other films, then you have nothing to worry about from this one and it deserves a place in your collection.

3574964,5,B001FB55I0,"Great edition to the Terminator Franchise. I actually liked this movie just as much as the first Terminator and T-2.  Why this film received little to no respect is beyond me, but I am assuming because it approaches outside the realm of old Arnold as the star.

 I was actually pissed when I heard they censored this film for the movie premier, and I recommend the director's version for rent or purchase.

 Why I like this installment of the Terminator franchise:

1.) They actually have the main plot set in the near future, unlike the others where only bits and pieces of the battle in the future had been shown.

2.) We get to see the real John Conner in action as a dynamic and brave soldier.  Christian Bale in my opinion had done a remarkable job with this role.

3.) They use modern US Military tactics and upgraded weaponry like the M-4 Carbine rifle, unlike other sci fi films.  I liked how the old Huey helicopters from Vietnam were featured, along with the awesome US Air Force A-10 jet fighters.

4.) We see more of Skynet and the earlier precursor models before Arnold's Terminator line.

5.) Kyle Reese's character is explained more, we see his transition from boyhood to adult hood and we grow to really like the different characters among the human resistance American soldier camp who takes the fight to Skynet.

6.) I loved Moon Bloodgood, she is an awesome action star and I hope to see her in more military related or sci fi films in the future.  She is gorgeous & perfect for the Terminator franchise.

7.) We see a broader element to the historical battles of the future between the freedom fighters and Skynet, where this sequel acts as a prequel to the first Terminator and even has a tie in as far as I can see with Lena Headey's FOX ""Terminator tv series"".

8.) Rap star and actor ""Common"" has a really good supporting role as Christian Bale's Lieutenant or Sergeant (2nd in command).  His role makes the ""Resistance"" seem down to Earth, in the form that these characters are everyday people who have the courage to keep fighting.

9.) I liked the conflict between the dumb Generals among the human camp vs the man who understands what Skynet is all about, and even though he has a low rank still manages to come up with a sound effective military strategy against Skynet's schemes.

 I see here the Director's cut feature's more violence in the fight scenes between the character ""Marcus"" vs the white trash street thugs, as well as some shots of brief nudity which is not in the original (so what & big deal if you ask me) but everything today has to be PC.  But it seems 85% of Hollywood's films are targeted toward the teen PG-13 audience exclusively, to the detriment of the rest of us action sci fi fans.

3575817,5,B001FB55I0,"After watching and sharing the original Terminator movies with my son; he informed there was another available that I wasn't aware of. Like many Terminator fans I always felt T2 was the pinnacle of the series I wasn't expecting terribly much of this film after what I felt was a lackluster attempt from T3. Not that I hated that movie but T2 had set the bar high in terms of creativity and Terminator progression. Turns out with Terminator Salvation the plot has been revized and this movie actually reinvented the story line to a viable and credible saga to be revered. The BluRay capability speaks for itself and I found the digital soundtrack which I personally listened to in DTS-HD to be a hearty track full of room booming and directional effects that really was emphasized across my 7.1 system. I must say I actually took note of my subs performance during this movie something a rarely note after years of different subs and many a movie's soundtrack.

In short I still give the edge to T2 for it's revolutionary story line and over the top effects comparatively speaking for it's day considering progression of story, soundtrack and overall quality of film. While it's impossible to compare the better quality BluRay provides and advances in soundtrack technology it is possible to measure creativity and personal opinion. So while I still believe T2 is the pinnacle of the Terminator series I highly recommend Terminator Salvation as a part of the series and I definitely look forward to the next Terminator movie in the series as a result of this film. I'd personally give it a solid second place in the series second only to T2.",1400630400,,1640,4.774647887323944

3575821,5,B001FB55I0,"This movie catches a lot of heat, mainly because Arnold was not in it. But to that I must say, he was in Rise of the Machines and that movie was decent, at best. This is most definitely my favorite next to the original. Now before you completely stop reading my review out of pure disgust from my last statement, let me explain... I liked T2 but I always thought it was too youth oriented. Sure there's killing and plenty of f-bombs, but it lacked the pure horror and intensity the first movie had. In my opinion, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick were the only two actors in the film that catered to adults. Arnold, and especially Edward Furlong catered directly to a young audience which essentially doubled profits.

Now back to Salvation, this movie catered to a more mature audience even though it was pg-13. The humor and childish elements that plagued the 2nd and 3rd films, and what's left is a solid apocalyptic action story. It's a very serious movie with a well written script. I'll admit I didn't care for the film when I first saw it at the drive in, but when I picked up the movie in the clearance section at the Exchange, I immediately loved it upon second viewing. There really isn't a dull moment throughout.

Forget the fact that there is no Arnold. The rest of the cast more than hold their own. Give it a chance and if you don't like it, watch it again. If nothing else, we're spared from beyond cheesey scenes ala Furlong teaching the terminator late 80's/early 90's lingo (I always fast forward thru that wretched scene).",1400198400,,1543,4.526881720430108

My favorite is the second Terminator movie and this 2nd then the original and then the third one in that order. The little girl in this film and her companion are the true heros and the Terminator is almost more likable then Connor.",1399852800,,373,4.582089552238806
3575884,4,B001FB55I0,"Terminator: Salvation (2009). Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: One Hour, 54 mins.
Directed by MCG.
  This is the fourth movie in the series.

Returning: Linda Hamilton lends her voice as Sarah Connor. Michael Papajohn returns, but now in the character of ""Carnahan"". This is one more surprise.

It is 2003 at the Longview State Correctional Facility. Inmate, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is being asked by Dr. Serena Rogan (Helena Bonham Carter) to sign a consent form to donate his body to Cyberdyne Systems.  It would give him a second chance to live.  He signs it only if he can have a kiss from the doctor. He kisses her and says, ""So that is what death tastes like"".  He is put to death by lethal injection.
  Now the story goes to the future, in the year 2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is now in New Mexico fighting the War of the Machines. He is after to kill every machine and Terminator.  John is the key to salvation. Underground he finds a SkyNet operations.  They find humans being held as prisoners. They also find out where Terminators are being built.
  Back on the topside, back on the desert, John Discovers all of his men are gone or dead. He fails to escape from a helicopter and another bomb has gone off. A cyborg tries to kill him, but John shoots him repeatedly. John calls for a rescue.
  That night, we see Marcus Wright walking in the desert somewhere near Hollywood.
  Later, in a submarine, the Resistance Command Headquarters, General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) isn't pleased with John's tactics, besides the fact he is known as a prophet.  General Losenko (Ivan G'Vera) explains to John they have found a solution to end this war. The machines use a shortwave transmitter to communicate, a hidden signal has been discovered. It allows for direct control of the machines. General Ashdown tells John, there is an ""off"" switch. John agrees to the mission. John only has 4 days. SkyNet wants to kill everyone in this room. John is #2 on the list. John asks General Losenko who is #1. It is his father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), now a teenager, years before he was transported to 1984.

Also in the cast: Jane Alexander, David Midthunder, Lorenzo Callender, Bryce Dallas Howard.

7-Eleven got some in-film advertising.

Filmed in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, New Mexico. Road scenes filmed in California.

This is the film where Christian Bale went into an on-set rage for 4 minutes yelling at a crew member, Shane Hurlbut. Apparently, he was checking out a light in the background while Bale and Bryce Dallas Howard was doing an intense scene. Bale had become distracted when the crew member walked into the scene. Shane continued to work on the film and Bale later apologized.
  Shane Hurlbut's next job was on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheech-Chong-Hey-Watch-This-HD/dp/B009TGO1X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheech & Chong: Hey Watch This [HD</a>] (2010). I'm sure he had more fun.

The icing is applied to the cake in a unique twist regarding SkyNet's long term plan at thwarting the resistance (no spoiler here) but I came away with the word ""excellent"" and I typically don't care for the Terminator thing anymore - this was good!",1399075200,,616,4.766355140186916

The pace was, to me, perfect, the acting very good, the plot interesting and the characters fun and well portrayed.

As for a recommendation? I don't give recommendations to others about movies, among other things, because of the completely subjective tastes and preferences each individual.

3575926,1,B001FB55I0,"This is a terrible movie. John Conner is not in the movie all that much, despite being a main character, and the grimy look of the future makes you think more of Waterworld than any other movie. But Waterworld was probably a better film, because it at least had a plot you could follow, and not washed-up execution statements like the addition of Sam Worthington's character (what is he supposed to be anyway?), while the emergence of CG Arnie lookalike T-800s is completely silly. I though that it would marry with the concepts of T3, such as showing scenes where they recover the machine that finally succeeds in assassinating John and send him back to the time of T3, where things all sort of come together, but no such luck. I might watch it again in a few years to see if I can make sense of it, or just to laugh at the mess. Yuck!",1396742400,,836,4.365384615384615

3576180,3,B001FB55I0,"I liked it better than I thought I would, but Sam Worthington is a terrible actor. I don't know why Hollywood insists on putting this guy in lead roles. At best he's a supporting actor or brother who's going to die at the beginning of the movie. He just feels fake, is not a good actor, and quite honestly detracts from the movie.

So, a lot of this movie is not about John Connor. It's not about the Arnold Terminator's. It's not even really about Kyle Reese. It's about Sam Worthington discovering he's a Terminator. (Oh what, you didn't know? Don't worry, the movie makes it obvious from the very beginning. I knew this fact before seeing the movie and I would have known because of how obvious the clues are.)

Anyway, yes, so it's about Sam Worthington regretting what he did to his family. What did he do to his family you ask? Hell if I know, THEY NEVER TELL YOU! Don't think there's some deeper meaning to it either. It's from the director of Charlie's Angels full throttle MCG. Anyone that calls themselves MCG cannot be taken seriously in my book.

The cinematography is awesome, the action is awesome, the fight scenes are awesome, the jets attacking the terminator ships are awesome. And Kyle Reese is quite likeable even though he doesn't quite fit the part. I mean, he looks nothing like Michael Bein, but he did an admiral job regardless. The CG Arnold was incredible and the backstory to the Terminators was enjoyable.

But in the end, it suffered from a fairly weak storyline and too much focus on, did you hear me the first time? Sam Worthington.

The cast that surrounded Sam was great. But because the movie put so much focus on this boring character, Terminator Salvation never reaches it's full potential.

Overall, it's definitely a fun movie to watch if you can just close your eyes to when mr. human terminator shows up.",1387152000,2,1845,4.592705167173253

3576235,2,B001FB55I0,"I was fired up to see this film when it first came out in theaters. It takes a serious amount of motivation to get me to the theatre as opposed to watching a film at home on my quality system. It's hard to fully convey how hugely disappointed I was while sitting through it.

The explosions were the only thing keeping me alert along with a couple Terminator-ish scenes involving the humanoid machines. Bale as John Conner did nothing for me and although I realized that he had to be sullen in an apocalyptic world , I just got tired of his empty look and monotoned voice. The overall acting was stiff . Many tight camera scenes had the look of a TV movie.  I could just see the cameras rolling in my head.

Using all the Terminator phrases and Skynet language just isn't enough without real tension from characters you like, or even want to hate. I cared more in Termanator 3, which was my least favorite of the first three, about what happened to the pets in the pet shop than anything going on in ""Salvation"".

I think they should have used the actor that played John Conner as an adult in clips from T2. I was more entertained from those ""in the future"" scenes than from this whole film. The film makers just couldn't carry this franchise into a fitting last installment. Try as they did to make connections to the past, the film just didn't capture the future ( that should make sense). The half man half machine character was visually cool and added the second star to my review.

It reminded me a lot of the first Mad Max movie, and I thought it had a good story. Its one, glaring flaw, that I could see, came when the terminators in the Skynet concentration camp/factory didn't blow away Kyle Reese the instant they identified him. There was nothing in the movie that indicated Skynet didn't know that Reese was going to be John Connor's father, else why were they looking for him? Still, I don't understand why the movie is so widely hated. Maybe people are reacting to the radical departure in format from the previous movies: no Arnold this time, no time travel, no futuristic robot in a modern setting -- rather, lots of futuristic robots in a futuristic setting.",1377734400,,796,4.652482269503546

I hope the $3,000 price tag on it today (8/26/2013) is a mistake. It's not worth over $100.00 in my honest opinion. Like the T2 Endo you get the feature of light up eyes, and the Theme song playing in the background. This is just a Endo with no special features. I do love this Endo, and I think it looks great above my Movie Display Shelf, but I think the movie collector deserves a little more with their money. If you can pick him up for less than $100.00USD.

THIS sequel however takes a more serious tone  with the story, its packed with great action sequences & filled with good actors like christen bale. Its a great stand alone film.

3576506,2,B001FB55I0,"T1 and T2 were great, and even T3 was above average stuff, within the action movie genre. But this is just trivial.

The director is not someone I'd ever heard of before, and I'm not sure who thought the man that made Charlie's Angels was qualified to do a Terminator movie, but the results are not so much bad as just yawn-worthy. The writing is also mediocre, with bizarre plot ideas that just lack credibility, not to mention whole scenes that make little or no sense. It is definitely painful to see what was once a great franchise sold into the fumbling hands of third-rate talent.

Oh, and the ending involves a gratuitous tear-jerker plot twist that is completely lacking in believability.

3576545,5,B001FB55I0,"""Terminator: Salvation"" is great! This is how the story goes: John Connor is the man fated to lead the human resistance against Skynet and its army of Terminators. But the future that Connor was raised to believe in is altered in part by the appearance of Marcus Wright, a stranger whose last memory is of being on death row. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus both embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind.

The cast led by Christian Bale (as John Connor) & Sam Worthington (in a break-out performance as Marcus Wright) is great! The directing by McG (who also directed ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000) & its sequel, ""Charlie's Angels: Full: Throttle"" (2003), he also directed ""We Are Marshall"" (2006) is great! The story and screenplay by John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris (both also wrote the screenplay to the upcoming ""Surrogates"" (2009), they also wrote the screenplay and story to ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (2003) & ""The Game"" (1997, which was directed by David Fincher) is great!

The music by Danny Elfman (who also did the music to ""Wanted"" (2008), ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" (2008), ""Milk"" (2008), ""Notorious"" (2009), & the upcoming ""Taking Woodstock"" (2009) & ""The Wolf Man"" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Shane Hurlbut (who also did the cinematography to ""We Are Marshall"") is great! The film editing by Conrad Buff (who also did the film editing to ""The Happening"" (2008), he also did the film editing to ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1991, was directed by James Cameron) & ""Titanic"" (1997, for which he won the Oscar for his work and was also directed by Cameron) is great! The casting by Justine Baddeley & Kim Davis (both of them did the casting to ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"", & ""We Are Marshall"", they also did to the upcoming ""Whip It"" (2009) & ""Where The Wild Things Are"" (2009) is great! The production design by Martin Laing (who was an art director on ""Titanic"" & is doing the production design on the upcoming ""Clash Of The Titans"" (2010) is great! The art direction by Patricio M. Farrell (who is also doing the upcoming art direction on ""Clash Of The Titans""), Gregory S. Hooper (who also did the art direction to ""North Country"" (2005) & ""In The Valley Of Elah"" (2007), Desma Murphy (who is an assistant art director on the upcoming ""The Hangover"" (2009), & Troy Sizemore (who also did the art direction on ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" (2007), ""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" (2007) & ""Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" (2008) is great! The set decoration by Victor J. Zolfo (who also did the set decoration to ""Zodiac"" (2007, also directed by Fincher) & ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" (2008, for which he won the Oscar for his work and was also directed by Fincher) is great! The costume design by Michael Wilkinson (who also did the costume design to ""300"" (2007) & ""Watchmen"" (2009), both which were directed by Zack Snyder) is great!

This is a great action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and interested as well. This is a great follow-up to ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"". This is another hit in the ""Terminator"" franchise.",1369526400,,3403,4.784013605442177

3576646,4,B001FB55I0,"Sam Worthington did an outstanding job as Marcus Wright, the convicted murderer who is given a second chance by the dying Dr. Serena Kogan in 2003.  However, Marcus's second chance begins in 2018 when he is awakened or freed from his Skynet cell for a special mission.

Of course Marcus is unaware of his true, altered self and his deadly mission programmed into his brain by Skynet.  As the film evolves, the concept of what is truly human is examined in intricate detail.

Michael Ironside as General Ashdown gave another stellar performance as the war-weary commander who wanted to end Skynet once and for all with an all out assault with a secret weapon.  Ironside always delivers a memorable character.

Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese, the most wanted man on the Skynet world, and his young apprentice, Star played brilliantly by Jadagrace added a nice touch to this CGI laden film.  You could say Star saves the day at the end of the film.

There were a few new twists to the story which this film explored.  The scene in the manufacturing facility where John Connor is searching for Kyle was a surprise for fans of the first three films.  This was well done.

Overall, the film is a good story told well and the CGI is well integrated into the human interaction.  The ending is not as surprising as intended since one could have surmised what the second chance motif actually meant throughout the film.

The $200 million feature made over $371 million worldwide.  Terminator 5 will see Arnold Schwarzenegger ""in the flesh"".",1365897600,3,1527,4.734848484848484

3576740,1,B001FB55I0,"""Terminator Salvation"" was an experience similar to watching a 3D movie without the glasses. It tries it's best to make it's action interactive and exciting to the audience, but only succeeds in coming off as a dull special-effects montage. It's a flat, by-the-books action film, void of any originality or credibility, successful only because it bears the name of one of the greatest action franchises of all time.

The first two Terminator films (1984's ""The Terminator"" and 1991's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") are films that will forever be regarded as classics in the genres of action and sci-fi. They combine their thrilling scenes of action with well-developed characters, clear and innovative plots, and the perfect amount of comic relief. The third Terminator film, released in 2003, was a rehash of Terminator 2 that failed to win the hearts of the fans, but is still considered to be a decent action film.

Now, in Terminator: Salvation, we're shown the aftermath of an apocalyptic future of mankind, where the humans are fighting an un-winnable war against deadly machines controlled by a super-computer called Skynet. John Connor (Bale), the future leader of the human resistance, hasn't quite reached his full potential by the beginning of Salvation; he's still trying to figure out if the future's inevitable, or if it can be changed for the better. Geez, you'd think he'd have figured it by now!

The film takes a further nosedive with the addition of a new Terminator, who in this movie is actually the first Terminator ever made. This particular Terminator has a unique twist; for some bizarre and unexplainable reason, he still thinks he's a human. Sounds exciting right? Well, it had the potential to be, but unfortunately the film goes nowhere with it. Instead, they decide to ham fist an utterly ridiculous fan service into the plot by having the new Terminator meet up with Kyle Reese.

For those who are unaware (believe me, I get confused myself), Kyle Reese was the hero of the first movie who happens to be John Connor's father, making him a major target during Salvation's time. Reese is completely oblivious to his importance to the resistance and manages to get himself involved with Terminators yet again. Who does this guy think he is, John Mclaine?

A coincidence of this nature is the mark of a lazy writer, and the writers of Terminator Salvation were clearly lazy about their work. Almost every piece of information given in this film contradicts with information given in any of the previous films. One could spend hours trying to figure out what Skynet knows, what it doesn't know, or what the characters know. They could even, god forbid, try and figure out what the hell is going on, but no matter how hard they think, they'll come to the same conclusion every time: none of it makes any sense.

The Terminator series was never meant to be continued after Terminator 2, it wrapped the plot up nice and tight, but the introduction of T3 turned the whole universe upside down, and now, everything about the film is so complex and confusing that it's not even worth trying to figure out.

The writers obviously want us to ignore the various plot holes, to ignore the silly and unrealistic motivations of the characters, and to ignore the terrible dialogue. Instead, they beg us to turn our brains into mush, while the fancy images on the screen keep us constantly entertained.

Terminator Salvation is a film so radically different from the first three that it shouldn't even be considered a part of the series. While the first two films revolutionized the action genre with the depth of their characters and plot, Salvation is a film that favors style over substance to a degree usually reserved for the likes of Michael Bay. It's so unrecognizable and detached from the original films that it resorts to a plethora of fan services, in a sad attempt to prove it's an actual sequel (I was surprised [and relieved] that nobody said ""Hasta la vista, baby!"").

This unjustifiable train wreck has resulted in a mindless special effects exhibit, featuring boring action and even more boring characters, who, although they try and convince us there's an actual story hidden somewhere, ultimately fail in doing anything at all.

This movie is responsible for over two hours that I've wasted from my life, time I could've spent on far more productive and fulfilling activities, like falling asleep for instance. I could rant like a nerd for hours about the movie, but then again, it's not worth wasting any more time on, so I'll conclude by pointing out that the director's name (McG) sounds like something on the dollar menu at McDonalds.

3576845,2,B001FB55I0,"As a sequel of the Terminator 1-3 movies,
this is a complete failure.
Greatly inferior to its predecessors
with regard to every aspect that I can think of.
Given that it is a post-apocalyptic war movie,
I expected it to be different,
but it was only tangentially related
to the other movies...
a few references here and there.
I expected this fourth movie to tie up the
complex time travel issues with resect to
Kyle Reese and the various terminators,
the timeline and the technology
and all the things that happened during that
future time.
I also expected further development
of the characters of Kyle Reese and John Connor
and perhaps even Sarah Connor and Kate Brewster,
concluding with the victory over the machines.
It does not deliver on any of those.
We do not see the future events we expect.
Then there is the completely unnecessary addition
of the Cyborg from the past and the warrior-babe
who loves him.
To the exclusion of the main plot lines! Why?

In addition to poor plot, characters and dialog,
I was also disappointed by the score.
When I saw the name of Danny Elfman in the credits,
I naturally expected a very creative score,
but it was essentially by-the-numbers scoring.

This is a movie that succeeds only as a
rather mediocre action movie
with some very cool FX, explosions, fights,
military battles, chases and stuff
involving characters that one doesn't care about
one way or the other.

If you love the Terminator movies,
you won't be missing anything

Outstanding action and special effects abound. But there isn't an emotional core to really draw you in. It's a strangely unfocused and distanced treatment that mechanically plods on. The scene that reveals the major re-editing is the second meeting of John Conner with Marcus Wright. In the first, John Conner only sees Marcus as an inert slab in a secret Skynet lab. In the second, he sees Marcus after he has been injured and captured by the resistance. Then he says, ""I thought I knew him."" Really? Clearly a more personal connection that might have given the events more meaning and emotional weight had been edited out.

Terminator was terminated when he was longer the lead character. What makes the different is that first 3 films are action thriller and part comedy, but the fourth film is much like a survivor horror, in which is not bad. But it sort of defiles the title, it's not ""terminator"" anymore, it should be called ""war of machines"", completely different direction. I'm struggling between giving the film 3 or 4 stars. In the end, it's still a disappointment without much of terminator action. As for a sci-fi war film, I think this is pretty cool movie. Christian Bale starts as John Connor in the early stage of war tried to lead the resistance to the ultimate victory, he did a fair job in my opinion since any leader would be skeptical if you face so many hump of metal in battle. The story is sort of typical in a survival film, whether face aliens, zombies or machines, all the films tried to answer the question ""what make us human"", what better way to answer the question than having a character is neither human nor machine and struggle to find his place.

3576924,3,B001FB55I0,"Terminator Salvation(released May/09)is a mixed bag of goodies starring Christian Bale as John Connor,Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright,Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese,Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan,Michael Ironside as General Ashdown and others. It is uneven and piecemeal,with two simultaneous plots which must ultimately mate,but the film takes its sweet time doing so.
The story finds us first in 2003 with the death of an inmate,Worthington,who has signed his body over to Cyberdine systems rep Carter,for experimentation. Fast forward to 2013 and Bale has survived a terrible attack and has returned to a submarine commanded by Ironside,who is the resistance leader. The resistance plans to launch an all out attack on the Skynet facilities and have  uncovered a plot to kill all the resistance leaders,including a civilian by the name of Kyle Reese. Everyone but John is unaware that Reese is his real father and that he must survive.
Meanwhile Worthington has come to L.A. and he is saved from a machine attack by Reese,whose importance he is yet to know. They travel on and find the pilot of a downed resistance aircraft. Along the way back to the resistance HQ,Worthington steps on a land mine. At HQ the medical people discover Worthington is really a Cyborg. Bale doesn't trust him,of course,and jails him. Worthington escapes,but while on the run from Connor and company,Worthington saves Connor's life. He vows to help Bale rescue Reese from the Skynet facility.
They arrive at Skynet and Worthington interfaces with the computer programming,learning about his roots and why he was created. They find Reese,but Bale has to do battle with a T-100 Terminator,with the face of Ahh-nold. This over they all escape,the facility is destroyed,but Bale is critically injured. The film ends as Worthington gives up his heart to Bale,so Connor may carrying on the battle.
If the reconciliation of the two diverging plots had been made clearer as the film went on,and it hadn't taken the majority of the film to finally come together,this film would have been much better than it was. As it is it is a slow progression,jumping constantly from one story to the other. Other than the actual voice of Linda Hamilton/Sarah Connor's voice from the earlier Terminator movies,and a likeness of Ahh-nold on a T-1 late in the movie,there is little else to connect to the first three films,actor wise. The major characters like Connor and Reese are totally different actors. And unless the film could have made up for this disconnect by having a better edited and intelligent script(which it didn't),then it was doomed to fail. It was good to see actor Michael Ironside on board as the hard nosed resistance commander. If you need a real tight butted,ball busting superior,who is either normal,psycho,or somewhere in between,Mr. Ironside's is the guy to call.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.there are no extras.
All in all a big disappointment. Two parallel plots which take most of the film to come together,leaves one bored as all get out and scratching ones head. Considering the talent on deck,this film should have been a winner,instead of a mediocre S/FX laden picture.",1356652800,,3223,5.069679849340866
3576925,2,B001FB55I0,"Believe it or not I think there was actually a chance that this could have worked (outside of James Cameron returning). Although T3 wasn't the best, it stayed much closer to the Terminator formula than Salvation did. Instead of taking a vision of the future that was already created for us by the inventor of the franchise (as seen in Terminator 1, 2 & 3), Hollywood saw this as a chance make a big Michael Bay-eque action, explosion, robot, summer-tentpole movie with a few notable names.

The first mistake they made was hiring one of the least competent filmmakers in all the world named simply 'McG'. The Mad Max style desert backdrop really pushed it further from making it feel like a true Terminator movie after seeing what it was supposed to be in the 3 previous movies. To top if off the casting of Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese (basically Christian Bale's father) really didn't make much sense. Michael Biehn was definitely NOT a teenager in the first movie when he went back to save Sarah Connor. Christian Bale really wasn't right for the part of John Connor (and he knows it) his infamous rant will always be attached to this movie and his name. And personally I didn't like the trendy casting of Common but that wasn't as big a deal.

It's very difficult for a Terminator movie to be legitimized without Stan Winston's iconic affects. While Winston passed away before the movie was released the lack of his presence was felt and the apparent reliance on CG and digital effects were obvious. Some of the endoskeletons that we are used to seeing are in this movie (T-800) and some that we haven't seen before (T-600, T-700), that was actually kind of interesting, as well as the featuring of the Hunter Killers. However some of the new machines they tried to implement were just too Transformery (motorcycles really?).

Finally the music (another trademark of the first 2 films) just wasn't strong enough. They chose Danny Elfman to essentially match Brad Fiedel (who basically retired from the biz in '95) and while he has done some fantastic music in his career he wasn't really the right guy for the job. The music should have been strong and able to stand on it's own like Fiedel's soundtrack for T2.

It's hard for me to look at this in any other way because of the fact that it is a Terminator movie, there are certain standards it should meet and this fell far below those standards. Unfortunately there is no salvation in this Terminator movie but I'm sure they'll try again (Terminator Genisys).",1356480000,,2514,4.680995475113122

Go figure.

I walked into `Salvation' with a lot of high hopes.  I love Christian Bale.  I think he is one of our finest working actors and so I was intrigued to see what he was going to do with this franchise.  I was also really interested to see more of Sam Worthington.  While I found `Avatar' an overrated mess, I really thought Worthington was a star in the film and wanted to see more of him.  Despite the fact that I tend to gravitate to more Oscar fare when it comes to my movie watching, I do like to indulge in mindless action fodder from time to time, so this seemed like a nice way to kill an evening.

Sadly, it killed it in all the wrong ways.

The story is boring and convoluted and just plain messy by the end and the action scenes, while engaging, aren't enough to carry the weight of the film.  Bale is awful here, the progression of the film is dull and disengaged and the end result is far too unrealistic to support the development of the series.  I mean, you need to sustain a particular narrative that has been maintained for three feature films now, and `Salvation' drops the ball and winds up being forgettable.  Worthington is the only reason to see the film.  He proves yet again that he is a force to be reckoned with.  Sadly, his star isn't rising like it should be, but I have hope for him yet.",1354752000,,1556,4.206081081081081

This movie is about as good as the other Terminator films. The acting is better, and the action is also on par with the others. The story in this movie is a bit less intense. I think the difference is that in the other movies, a catastrophic and Earth shattering global event is about to take place that must be avoided. This movie is more of a personal crisis for John. It's a good story, but it lacks the drama of an impending nuclear holocaust of something like that. It's still good though.

I hated it when I saw it in the theaters and never bothered to watch it again until now. 1 and 2 are so good it is hard to accept anything less, but I suppose I finally could see it as a stand alone (like Terminator comics and games) and it is pretty *beep* good. Still dumb *beep* like T-800 throwing Jon around when he should be snapping his neck, but hey it isn't perfect by any stretch. I like that you can take or leave the 3rd one since it doesn't follow it directly.

This one doesn't suffer from the *beep* camp in that movie and thank god it is not another car chase/remake. If you want a Future War film, this is it, warts and all. Plot is actually really good, with some good twists and mystery. One thing I appreciated more this time was how the villain, refreshingly enough, is Skynet itself this time and will operate much differently than a human army or one cyborg sent back in time with a simple mission. Sort of hard to follow as far as what Skynet knows and doesn't know, but that puts us in a similar position as the humans in the movie.

It's too bad this didn't do better b/c I'd like more (hopefully T5 and 6 by William Wisher happens!).

Pretty darn bad.

It plays like a cheesy Mad Max movie - except it wasn't produced in Australia with a then-unknown brand new actor and a low budget in the '70's.

The key ""reveal"" of the movie is thrown away almost accidentally. No psychological, wonder if, wonder what, build up. No doubt or surprise when a team member switches sides. In short, these days even comic books are much deeper.

Don't get me started about the young actor who plays Kyle Reese, John Connor's future time traveling father. He was completely unsuited to the role! (But played an excellent ""Chekhov"" in the Star Trek reboot the same year.)

It's a shame since the story is a postulation of things soon to come. (If you scoffed at that last comment, look up the word postulate). It really should have been treated with more reverence.

3577141,1,B001FB55I0,"Well, there's nothing like destroying a franchise, is there? Take two of science fiction and Hollywood's most beloved movies, remove everything that was ever good about them and flush them down the toilet - and Jim Cameron's not even dead yet. I love - LOVE - the originals and it pains me to watch my adoptive children get the George Lucas treatment. Let me count the ways in which this film will be remembered as one of the bedrock events in the destruction of storytelling and a critical step towards Michael Bay receiving the Nobel Peace prize and Best Screenplay Oscar in 2020.

I knew from the beginning it didn't look good from having a director called McG - Mr T was the last three-lettered celebrity I can remember but at least he didn't try to direct a film. When Helena Bonham Carter showed up as the stereotyped terminal cancer patient, I knew we were in trouble. And then Sam Worthington showed up (the Gene Hackman of our times, appearing in about 10% of all films currently being made) and couldn't decide on an American or Australian accent for the duration of the shoot. Fortunately, it's not too noticeable since Christian Bale's Batman growl steals the show.

If you can cast your mind back to the legitimate Terminator films, one of the rules is that bullets don't tend to do much damage to Terminators whereas molten steel is a pretty effective way in taking one out. In this film, it's the reverse - Christian Bale takes out a T-800 with a machine gun but fails to destroy one with molten steel. Go figure. And that's the most faithful this film gets to the originals.

Then there's a whole bunch of new characters introduced that nobody cares about and they attempt to recycle some of the iconic dialog (""Come with me if you want to live,"" to which the only response is ""If the rest of the film is this bad, I'll stay here."")

Back to the bad and broken logic, Skynet is no longer trying to exterminate people but rather farm them for some reason that doesn't make any sense. It turns out that Sam Worthington is 50% Terminator too but by the time we find out, it's no surprise because we saw it in the trailer. More of a surprise is the massive Transformers-style bot that's incredibly bad at catching people. And then there's the even bigger surprise of the motorcycle-shaped Terminator that takes a USB Flash drive - thank God the USB2.0 protocol survived the war.

At some point Bryce Dallas Howard shows up, thankful that she's in something marginally better than Lady in the Water. Apparently, Claire Danes is still recovering from embarrassing herself in Terminator 3 and couldn't bring herself to this horror show. I don't really remember why she's there.

Anyway, plot-wise we get into some really convoluted plan by the machines that makes the average episode of Murder She Wrote look like Agatha Christie. They build this half-human-slash-cyborg thing to lure out John Connor when the real thing was infinitely more effective (or they could have just killed his father when they held him in the farm). Skynet is apparently running Windows ME since their strategic logic wouldn't win a chess game let alone Future War.

The ending - slight SPOILER ALERT here - is so far-fetched I had to rewatch a Christopher Nolan film to bring back my faith in the movie industry. There's a heart transplant surgery that would make a daytime soap opera blush and literally I was ready to head out for a beer when it happened.

So sorry for the rant but the first Terminator films are largely responsible for my love of movies and McG just did the worst possible job. Terminator 3 was possible to ignore but Terminator Salvation leaves my brain rocking back and forth in my head trying to make sense of the whole thing. As far as I'm concerned, this story ended perfectly when Arnold was lowered into the molten steel and that's the end of it.

Terminator Salvation in my opinion is by far the worst terminator movie mainly because there is no point to the movie. No big secrets are revealed nothing new was done that hasn't been done before and better, and the story went no where except to make money and to get ready for more movies down the road.

The only actors that had any impact were Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood. They were the only two that felt alive during this movie. Christian Bale did a terrible job, and he's a good actor two. Which reflects badly on the director McG. After all he did direct the two bad Charlie's Angles movies.

The only real good thing about this movie were the special effects, but if that's the best thing you can say about a movie that isn't animated than that's not saying much.

3577147,3,B001FB55I0,"In terms of mindless adventure films, this one was excellent from the beginning.  Plenty of action sequences, battles, and nasty terminator robots.  I can't fault the film: it's a generous serving of goofy fun.  But it's when you get into the subplot and the mysterious Marcus character that things start to get a little bit perplexing.  Spoilers start below:

(spoilers) From the beginning, you know something is fishy with Marcus, and there are some creative parallels suggesting he might be a terminator himself, but once the bomb is dropped and we find out that he is a strange terminator/human hybrid, then the questions start rolling in.  I lost sleep after this film, pondering how exactly certain problems in this scenario could be figured out.  For instance, he's a terminator with a human brain: wouldn't he start to question his lack of ability to eat or drink, or desire to?  And what about bathroom functions?  If you still had a human brain in a terminator body, wouldn't you start to question why those details don't matter anymore?  And how could a heart function without the rest of the circulatory system, such as lungs to give the heart oxygen, or bone marrow for blood cells, etc, etc?  And if the final terminator gave Marcus a massive damaging heart punch at the end, why would that make for a healthy heart for a transfer?  And in a post-apocalpytic setting, would they even have the facilities and medicines to accomplish a heart transplant?

Even more perplexing is that the goofy robots of Cyberdyne would devise THIS sort of system to try to outsmart John Connor.  Wouldn't it make more sense to try more time travel, and this time go after Sarah Connor's mom, or something more linear and logical like that?

Anyhow, if you don't read into the film, and don't think of too deeply, it's good fun.  Seeing Michael Ironsides in action again as the, well, the Michael Ironsides character again, was a nice touch as well.  But come on, did John Connor really dive into the ocean and swim into a submarine?",1329868800,,2028,4.748571428571428

3577149,1,B001FB55I0,"I'm a fan of the first two Terminator films.  T2 is a brilliant piece of cinema, in terms of both special effects and plot.  The character development in the script, and the subsequent performances by the actors, was leveraged superbly by director and franchise creator Jim Cameron.  Even Ah-nold kept it together enough to portray a cyborg as something more than a one-dimensional machine.

So it was with some anticipation that I purchased the (hopefully) LAST installment in the Terminator franchise: Terminator Salvation.  It's depressing to note that, for the $200 million it cost to make this film, 500 college students could have had a 4-year free ride to Stanford, and we as a species would be significantly closer to a cure for cancer.

Alas, not so.  This film is devoid of any perceivable cinematic value, other than as an excuse to blow stuff up for two hours.  Given that director McG is famous for pyrotechnic stunts and infamously weak in plot and character development, I should have known what to expect.  But here's what I didn't expect:

****** WARNING: SPOILER ALERTS ******

-- Endless cheesy homages to the original Terminator films: ""Come with me if you want to live;"" ""I'll be back;"" fleeing from danger in a mini-camper; one-armed shotgun pumping (btw, Sarah Connor did it because her other arm was BROKEN, not because it was ""cool,"" Anton); a factory battle-to-the-death featuring molten steel and a ""frozen"" terminator; and, sadly, more.

-- Endless cheesy homages to classic films in general.  The elevator ride in the big climax before Skynet goes (predictably) boom, a la Sigourney Weaver in Aliens; McG's own characterization of the escape of Markus, Star, and Kyle Reese from the ill-fated desert gas station (oh, and yeah--just like in T2--a boy, a female, and a cyborg seek shelter in an abandoned desert GAS STATION) as being ""like the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow"" in the Wizard of Oz, in which they ""ease on down"" (The Wiz) ""the yellow brick road"" (The Wizard of Oz) in their escape (I'm surprised he failed to liken the motobots chasing after them as flying monkeys).  Disturbing, however, was McG's literal on-camera reference to a moment in which cyborg Markus heads into danger instead of fleeing as being ""just like the firefighters in 911, who we homaged in that scene"" (I kid you not -- see the Blu-ray theatrical release disc's extra features).

-- The inability of Sam Worthington to decide whether he should deliver his lines with an American accent, or his native Australian accent; and the inability of McG to direct him either way (maybe he was elsewhere on set blowing stuff up).

-- Christian Bale's mono-dimensional performance of John Connor, in which he appeared less animated than a T-600 and uninspired to deliver his lines in any voice other than a hoarse shout.

-- The completely galling, almost giddy revelation of Anthony Simonaitis, the Key Powder Foreman (again, watch the movie's popup-enhanced Blu-ray version) that, while filming the gas station demolition scene in New Mexico, ""we had to keep a 50-feet column of fire (burning) for 2 more days; (so we) built a steel framework, hooked that up to a fuel tanker ... and burned 2000 gallons of fuel over the course of 2 days.""

McG: The Ozone Layer just called; it wants its atmosphere back.

If there was an Oscar for Blowing Stuff Up, Terminator Salvation would be Academy-worthy.  Otherwise, this film represents nothing more than $200 million up in smoke.",1327190400,10,3481,4.917948717948718

What I liked about it:
1. Christian Bale nailed it as John Connor!
2. Sam Worthington's character Marcus was a great edition to the
Terminator universe!
3. The battles were well done!
4. The visual effects were top notch!
5. We sall some cool, new Terminators!
6. I'm glad that all the human resistance took John Connor's
side when Micheal Ironside put him down!
7. Moon Bloodgood was a great edition to the world of the Terminator!

What I didn't like about it was:
1. Bryce Dallas Howard was not the best choice for Kate Connor!
2. Helena Bonham Carter was not the best choice for the
doctor (or whatever she was)!
3. The pace to the movie was choppy!
4. The lighting/coloring to the movie wasn't very impressive!
5. Come on, a Terminator movie without Arnold...?! What is the
world coming too?!
6. Why would a human lab/scientists turn Marcus into a
Terminator?
7. And speaking of which, didn't they destroy Cyberdine in T2?
8. The movie point wasn't as strong as the first three movie's
where (in T1, they were warned about Judgment Day, in T2, they
try to stop Judgment Day, in T3, we discover that Judgment Day
will come no matter what and it happens, but this movie simply
showed how John Connor became the leader of the resistance...)!
9. The movie was too focused on Marcus and not enough on John
Connor!

one will be better!

Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy plot devices.

Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline, or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.

The movie is riddled with such devices. They play out, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We learn nothing new.

It did make me laugh though - the conversation that may have lead to re-incorporating the topless bit for the director's cut:

The acting was actually good, not on the level of T2 but still well enough to keep the audience absorbed in the film. Sam Worthington in his American debut, even though he had already filmed `Avatar', steals the movie from Christian Bale.

Salvation lacks something. We get see the T-600 models of the Terminators, but we don't get to see them in full force, only three or four personal encounters and not a full on battle in the post nuclear wasteland. It's not an actual war movie and that's what Terminator fans wanted to see, full on early battles between humanity and Skynet that were hinted at in the first two films, but instead we only get commando raids that begin and end the movie with formulaic action sequences in between.

We also don't see John Conner lead. He's either being bossed around by command or working with a small number. It's Marcus who's the real star and a far more interesting story.

3577251,2,B001FB55I0,"Terminator Salvation
2009 / 115 min. / PG-13

Synopsis: John Conner (Christian Bale) is fated to lead humanity's war against the machines, but the arrival of a stranger, Marcus Wright, (Sam Worthington) alters the future of mankind.

It had been six years since we last saw an installment to the Terminator franchise. That film, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, was viewed as a ""disappointment"". Since then, a lot had changed. Most notably, Arnold Schwarzenegger walked away from acting to become the Governor of California. So leading into a fourth film, many were concerned if there was even life to the franchise after Arnold.

There was a lot at stake with Terminator Salvation, the fourth film in the popular franchise. The huge burden was inexplicably handed over to the Charlie's Angels director, McG. As to be expected, the internet was aghast with the announcement. ""How could this guy be the one to carry on the franchise?"" Soon after, fans seemed to cool down due to the signing of Christian Bale as John Connor. This casting decision, however, would cause serious havoc to the screenplay penned by Terminator 3 scribes John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris. Connor, who was originally conceived as a small, mystical figure was now required to be sprinkled throughout the entire film causing the characters of Marcus Wright and Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) to be diminished. Ultimately, this is where it all goes wrong for the film. The script had been raped and pillaged and devoid of what the fans would have expected with such a concept. All we get is wall-to-wall action with very little in between.

Christian Bale, who is often cited as being 'terrible' in this film, just simply has nothing really to work with and ultimately, the character of John Connor actually seems to be pretty pointless. The same could be said for Bryce Dallas Howard as his wife Kate. It often feels - as was the case - that these characters were shoehorned in with nothing for them to do. Sam Worthington, however, is really the only interesting thing about the movie. His character may not be great but at least he offers something. In fact, I would have loved to have seen more of the relationship between him and Reese be developed instead of the need for an explosion every two minutes. That is, however, the one good thing that could be said for the film. It certainly has some nice looking effects.

The real problem here, as stated earlier, is the script. There's nothing going on, and when there is, it becomes flat out illogical or it contradicts elements of the previous Terminator movies. They do try to appease the die-hards by infusing some nostalgia by incorporating Linda Hamilton's voice, the CGI-Schwarzenegger and throwing in a sampling of the series' classic theme, but despite it all, it never truly feels like a Terminator movie. Many may pin that on its PG-13 rating, but in honesty, an R-rating wouldn't have saved this one. And don't even get me started on the film's ending. Who the hell thought that was a good idea?!

Overall, Terminator Salvation is essentially one loud, elongated action sequence that lingers on and on for nearly two hours. It's poorly paced and erratically edited with no substantive dialogue or situations. It's just a flimsy, unoriginal, forgettable film that would have been best left unmade.",1318377600,2,3336,4.885159010600707

3577255,4,B001FB55I0,"After Terminator 3 a lot of people probably figured the series was over. Arnold was gone, Judgment day happened, what else was left? Terminator Salvation takes on the next logical subject, the war of the future. Salvation's apocalyptic showdown is a bit more tame than the one Cameron originally gave us- unstead of a hellish, black warzone roamed by uncountable armies of terminators, Salvation takes the life after people route as human stragglers hide from roving killer robots in the abandoned derelicts of civilization. The film follows a crew of heroes who come together to battle Skynet, culminating in more of the industrial-warhammer-hell you might have expected.

Perhaps one of the biggest stars of Salvation is the special effects work. As much as possible this film uses model work and animatronics SUPPLIMENTED by CG, and it shows. The corny CG of 3 is gone, replaced by believable, gritty mechanized mayhem. This realism cost the film dearly, giving a budget it couldn't really hope to recoup, but it's worth it as an example of what you can do if you don't just rely on computers.

The BD looks and sounds fantastic. Unlike the overproduce T3, Salvation has grain in the night shots, tons of detail, and all sorts of rugged post-apocalyptic dirt on actors faces (except the pristine and, in this version, slightly more nude Moon Bloodgood). The terminators in particular look genuinely awesome, although they don't quite achieve the jerky nightmarish appeal of the stop-motion original. Like T3 this movie ONLY has a pop-up menu. There's a good variety of special features and additional footage- some of the restored content, primarily the expansion of some of Marcus' scenes, is a welcome addition to the film, while other bits, such as the aforementioned almost-nudity, seem poorly edited in.

Overall, this is a worthwhile buy for series fans and hi-def aficionados, although the slow, moody pace and dependance on past material may put off people new to the series. So if you haven't seen any Terminator films and you're looking at this... Buy all 4. They're cheap now.",1312761600,,2090,5.034682080924855

Sam Worthington puts forth a solid performance as Marcus Wright the man who becomes machine and yet somehow remains a man.  Christian Bale's intensity as John Connor does not disappoint in communicating the weight, seemingly resting upon one man's shoulders, of saving humanity from the machine intelligence Skynet.

Terminator Salvation is a dependable addition to a movie collection for the scifi enthusiast.",1307750400,,722,5.298245614035087
3577258,3,B001FB55I0,"The first couple Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmaker's decision to set the fouth installment in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance.

A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad -- Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) -- who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand is Conner's babe Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter, who's somehow hooked up with Skynet.

On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that's merely an excuse to string together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, people we neither know nor care about. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. It's simply too much. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfire due to extreme overkill. That's why they call it ""overKILL."" It's a curious thing but all too true.

Be that as it may, there are enough worthwhile elements to give the film 3/5 Stars.

- Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise.
- At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a brief warm moment in a world gone mad. If the film contained more scenes like this it would have been more effective.
- There's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters.
- Bryce Dallas Howard has a very uniquely beautiful face. She also has better curves now that she's older. (Would I even be mentioning inconsequential stuff like this if the movie were engrossing?)
- There are a some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both.

Bottom line: If you love action you'll get it here -- there are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots, Schwarzenegger-bots -- all trying to terminate the protagonists. Yet, strangely, none of the myriad actions sequences rival the ultra-thrilling ones in the previous three films and it's difficult to discern why beyond the reasons already cited.

The first two films successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. ""Terminator Salvation,"" on the other hand, fails to ever truly captivate and instead opts for wall-to-wall action, creating dull overkill. That's too bad, but it has it's moments; it's thankfully not as bad as ""The Mummy Returns"" in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot.

The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico.

3577300,5,B001FB55I0,"It goes without saying that the ""best"" Terminator film was the first, simply because it *was* the first! There is something to be said for originality, after all. Still I am far more impressed with ""Terminator Salvation"" for a couple of reasons:

First, the theme of the other Terminator films is worn out. How many times can we watch a film about one terminator chasing some people all over the country before it gets old? I always found the brief war scenes in those films far more intriguing, and I often wondered why the script writers did not include a lot more of them. At last, they have! The whole film is about the war, and Skynet is no longer some distant, mostly unseen enemy but a true adversary who is visibly present in every scene. That is what I have wanted to see-- the WAR against the machines!-- not a single terminator chasing people a few people around in circles again.

Second, the special effects of this film were awesome. Whatever might be lacking in terms of acting skills (which Terminator film had good acting anyway?), it made up for it with special effects. The Terminators are so realistic that I have literally had a few nightmares about them-- just the kind of scare I love from a movie! The only aspect that lacked realism is that the Terminators seem to be incompetent marksmen for being such advanced machines. How many rounds does it take to hit a target, after all? ""Spray and Pray"" seems to be how Terminators shoot, which results in far more misses than hits, and that makes little sense to me when our contemporary computer-guided missiles can strike with pinpoint accuracy. It also seems like an awful waste of ammunition to me. Nevertheless, I can see why it is a necessary part of the show. We could not have Terminators who shoot with pinpoint accuracy without blowing away all hope for human victory now, could we? Ah, such unrealistic elements are a necessary evil. This is science *fiction,* after all!

All in all, this is my personal favorite of all the Terminator films. It may not have the originality of the first, but it is certainly the most impressive in terms of war scenes and special effects. This is why I am giving it a five-star rating.",1306886400,4,2199,4.604591836734694

3577302,5,B001FB55I0,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it was the best one I saw that year.  The story was straight sci fi.  The new vision of the terminator movie has a awesome variety of terminators.  They are done from a motorcycle type to a human skeleton type to a huge space ship type.  The visuals are very dark sort of like the last 2 alien movies were done.  Also I saw the late Stan Winston worked on the movie.  I think he did a lot of special effects in the alien movies.  I think he did the alien queen in aliens.

Anyway the special effect are really well done.  I could forget about reality and just watch the screen and go to another place.  That is when the special effects are done well.

Also the world was well done and you could tell they spent the money to design many sets and have many location to keep the viewer interested.  I compare the visuals of the world to that of Alien 3 or Alien Resurection.

The music is done well and is very emotional.  It was done by Danny Elfman.

The acting and story was top notch.  It is a story of sacrifice and redemption.  The two leads Sam Worthington and Christian Bale were exceptional.  Christian Bale is always good at getting you to care for his character.  I think he is an actor that can bring out a lot of emotions for the viewer.  I thought Sam Worthington was very good at this also in this movie.  The woman Moon Bloodgood was good also and believable in her role.  Anton Yelchin was also very good in his role.

Also this movie had very mild cussing and the violence and content was not trashy or overdone.  Which I think the last terminators went overboard on this.

Recommended to families to watch with children over 13.  I think the parents won't find anything objectionable.

If you haven't seen this due to hearing that it wasn't good.  Give it a chance.  I liked it, maybe you will too.

3577304,1,B001FB55I0,"If what you look for in a movie is a bunch of generic people spouting a bunch of generic duologue, this is the movie for you!

None of the charm, subtlety, depth, or focus of the first two Terminator's (or, dare I say, even the third) survived this adaptation. The locations are stale and lifeless, the people are as robotic and artificial as the CGI robots they're fighting, and only name recognition gives us any indication that this is even related to the original movies. I don't like any of these people, I don't care about any of these people, I'm not interested.

In the first three movies we got the sense that the protagonists were running away from a powerful and malevolent menace. Attempting to survive an implacable foe, in order to achieve a goal that meant the difference between humanity's survival and its annihilation. But here, the wooden, generic pod people run from a summer action blockbuster in order to survive long enough to set up another special effects shot.

Some lip service is given to the the issue of ""identity"" ""choice"" ""free will"" and ""prejudice"" but it's underused and unconvincing. It comes off as an attempt to 'remind' the audience that ""Terminator"" is about ideas, rather than actually presenting them.

The most I can say about this movie is that, as you watch it, you will quickly feel (as i did) as though you might as well be watching anything.",1303344000,4,1388,4.699588477366255
3577305,4,B001FB55I0,"This review has spoilers and assumes most people reading it have seen the movie (it's been out for quite a while), so if that's not you, you should probably skip this!

I approached this movie from the position that Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made. So its sequels have a lot to live up to. I did enjoy the third movie, but Terminator Salvation is relievedly grittier, with more action and lots of scary robots. It's the year 2018, and John Connor is 34 and a lieutenant in the Resistance; his father, Kyle Reese, is a teenager somewhere in the wastelands of L.A.; and a man named Marcus Wright appears, having last been seen receiving a lethal injection in 2003. And yes. The external USB drive lives on.

In the first half of the movie I was reminded so much of The Road Warrior (or Mad Max 2) because that movie was so brilliantly, awfully dystopian, just the vast, unforgiving outback splattered with blood, populated by seriously, ridiculously insane people. Marcus Wright, Kyle Reese, and the silent child (who looks very oddly like a young Janet Jackson) are up against the same bleak landscape, only dealing with machines with a singular agenda.

I was also reminded of Robocop, when Marcus realizes he did not die but was instead merged with cybernetics and metal; and even Transformers, because of the height and bulk of some of the Skynet machines.

The action sequences themselves are excellent, and you have to love the POV we're presented with when Connor's helicopter goes down near the beginning of the movie. The machines have always looked frightening, with their red eyes and body-builder necks, and I have to say they got my heart going in several scenes. There are fond homages, as is requisite with sequels, it seems: Marcus breaks out the windshield glass of a battered 18-wheeler; Reese says ""Come with me if you want to live;"" Arnold returns via CG.

It was actually unnecessary to have the Marcus Wright character. The participants of the Resistance are up against enough as it is. His mission wasn't to kill John, or Kyle. So what was it? I can't even say, which means it must not have been that important. The movie didn't need a time-traveling machine/man, and the more I think about it, the more the character could be taken out of the movie with little damage done to the plot. Obviously it's not good for a main character to be so superfluous. (Yes, I know, he gave his heart; but as a writer I can tell you how easy it would be to just give John a different injury)

Interestingly, John Conner ends up fighting a machine that was twice his protector in the past (a replica, of course). Though the terminator loses his ""Schwarzenegger face"" early, it is against him that both John and Marcus battle, and I found that kind of poetic and sad in a science-fictiony way. In the end, the terminator was always only a machine programmed with a mission.

I have a problem with the forced romance between Marcus and Blair Williams, the young woman who fights in John's unit. In fact, I have a problem with any movie that injects romance ""just because"" and it happens ALL the time and I'm really tired of it. In this case, because Blair seems pretty plucky and self-sufficient, her feelings for Marcus, especially after finding out he's a machine, make her seem just kind of weak and stupid. The movie should have tried to emphasize that Blair lives in a world with too few real prospects for love, a world in which ""not even if you were the last man on earth..."" has to be re-thought, and how depressing that is. But Blair seems content to be a soldier and just accept life for what it is. Not exactly the mindset of someone who would immediately fall in love with a robot. It just wasn't well done, in my opinion, and there was a way it could have been and the writers/director missed the mark.

Another thing that disappointed me was that it is set in 2018, not 2027 or whichever year people and machines began being sent back in time. I guess they want to start a new trilogy, but I think that's too much. This movie should have been about the end of Skynet, plain and simple. Why call it ""Salvation"" otherwise? I went in hoping to see John Conner truly save the world, not just move up the ranks. T2 was such a vast accomplishment, basically a perfect movie, that to try and keep the story alive will only continue to submit subsequent entries in the franchise to inevitable comparisons to a movie that can never be topped.

Terminator Salvation is very good, better than the third, and I appreciated how well done the action was because it's always so crucial to these movies. I think Christian Bale was a perfect choice for his role, and if you look at the John shown at the beginning of T2, there is scarily some resemblance in certain light. However, the need for the Marcus Wright character just isn't there, and it's depressing that the fight against Skynet STILL isn't over. At this point we can literally sympathize with the Resistance...",1302652800,,4990,4.578947368421052

3577308,3,B001FB55I0,"The Good:
Special effects are in general excellent. Sound design is great if you have a home theatre set-up. I liked the performances of Sam Worthington's and Anton Yelchin and there were a couple of nice little homage's to the first two films - the ""come with me if you want to live"" line and the nod to Guns and Roses.

The Bad:
Christian Bale - now I know his performance has split the Amazon critics, for me it didn't really work. I found his performance very wooden and he exhibits none of the charisma that I would expect a leader of a resistance movement to have.
The Plot - in a nutshell there's too many holes.
We never really find out what motivates the Sam Worthington character. He emerges from the ground and starts walking - he tells Kyle Reese that he's heading north - for what? - it's never explained.
And why for example does Skynet need to lure John Connor to its base - surely, if it just killed Kyle Reese then Connor would not exist anymore -the film is a bit sketchy on the whole time travel, cause and effect thing anyway. And given that Skynet is using Reese to lure Conor, the whole premise behind Sam Worthingtons character becomes a bit redundant.
I know that at its heart it's just a big dumb action movie but I like my dumb action movies make some kind of sense - at least in the context of their own universe.
Oh, and John Connor's wife must be one of the most underwritten characters I've ever seen - she literally adds nothing to the movie.

In summary, it's not a bad movie - it's certainly better than T3, but it really doesn't stand up to comparison with the first two movies in the franchise.",1299801600,,1629,4.337704918032787

3577373,3,B001FB55I0,"With a bit of a disappointing movie called 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', about six years later, we get 'Terminator Salvation'.  To me Terminator Salvation felt more of a Terminator movie than that of T3, and it seemed like the people involved understood the mythology of the Terminator franchise that was made popular by James Cameron.  Unlike the first three movies which involved people or machines going back in time, this time it's set sometime after the future had happened, the Resistance vs Skynet.  While there are somethings that I liked how they went about making nods to the movies done by James Cameron and was interesting how they went about showing that, never expecting the one thing around the end of the movie.

The writing is one thing that I think is better with this compared to the third movie and the director McG seemed to understand the franchise better than what I think that Mostow did.  While the future that is envisioned in Salvation may look a little different than what was shown in Cameron's Terminator movies.  With Salvation is in the early stages of the war or that McG wanted to show how the war may have been than that compared to what Cameron had envision for when he done the movies.  Though I never thought that DVD owners wouldn't have a Director's Cut of the movie that was originally made it rated 'R' like the first three, but only thing is that there's only like around two extra minutes added to it.  The extras there isn't that many with the DVD release but a good chance to see some behind the scenes look.  Overall I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.",1298505600,,1601,4.550522648083624

O.K., I'll admit from the start I am fan of the Terminator franchise and although I went to see this with some trepidation after T3, I have to say I came away pleasantly surprised. As a stand alone film (which may the best way to look at it) this is pretty good and as part of the overall series it develops the story well and has something to add to the previous films. It will never be as good as the first two films, but I'm glad to say it's better than T3. Bale is good as John Connor, if a little wooden at times, but the real surprise was Sam Worthington who has the best role in the film. The CGI effects are good, but not overbearing and McG's direction was ok, but a little too jerky for my tastes. You do get some cheesy lines in this film and plenty of nods to the previous films, but nothing too excessive and most produce a wry smile rather than outright groans. The main problem with this film is that you don't care about the characters that much. In the first films you wanted to know what happened next and considered the lives of the main characters, but in this film they are just faces on a screen delivering lines. It's sad but true and the main downfall of this film. If you go expecting your typical Hollywood action movie you'll be fine, just don't expect anything of great substance or anything as good as the first two films and you won't be disappointed. 3.5 stars

We are somehow supposed to believe that the machines would build a perfect human based cyborg without some override or control mechanism. We are also supposed to believe that John Connor and the resistance are stupid enough to use the cyborg's heart to save Connor when the cyborg is the perfect mechanism for infiltrating the machines and the only one who can actually fight them. We also are supposed to believe that the humans still are using guns against the machines that cannot damage them. Also why is it that in the obligatory final fight scene that there is only one machine participating when there are thousands of them handy? Then why is it that the machines always toss around our hero instead of just dispatching him? Lastly, why was it necessary to lure Connor to Skynet and to capture Reese in order to kill them when the spiffy cyborg could have easily killed both?

The action is good, the Terminators are great (including that one that looks identical to Arnold S. circa 1984), but the story isn't. They just don't make action movies the way they used to, when they not only had good action, but they also had something to entertain you even when something wasn't blowing up.

3577391,4,B001FB55I0,"I thought this film was a step up from T3's Terminatrix nonsense, but it still went downhill in the final 30 minutes as far as plot points go (thus getting four stars). The entire film relies on the predictions of the nature of time travel. Several very bad military errors were made, even some by Connor himself, that made me want to choke those who wrote the script. This just takes away from any enjoyment of or engrossment in the action and possible emotions of the film. Cameron's vision is ultimately lost where characters have not been developed to their full potential.

As a woman, I see a failed role model in Blair Williams, who, far from what it appears they were going for, is more of a slut than a girl looking for comfort. I'm sure the boobery helped to sell the movie, however.

The corroborating plot points with T2 are extremely overt and annoying. They were not well-thought out, but thrown in to give a sense of continuity.

The parts of Kyle Reese, Sam Worthington, and John Connor are played by excellent actors, and it is their performance that carries this movie along. If not for the bad writing, this film could have been absolutely amazing. For those excellent actors, I still retain that 4 star rating.

Even so, the recordings Linda Hamilton made were obviously rushed and I don't blame her. She was too good for this film.

That said, this film should have been the real T3. I consider it so in my collection. It deserves a place because the predicted War Against the Machines has come. It had to come, and it had to be told, to give any weight to the prophecies of the first two films. Or.. maybe the mystery was better.

3577392,5,B001FB55I0,"I got Terminator Salvation for Christmas because I have the first 3 and need to keep the series going. (Doesn't everyone do that?)

It picks up long after the events of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines where we see John Connor (Christian Bale) as a soldier in the human resistance against the Skynet.

Before the first battle scene, we're privy to Sam Worthington's character, Marcus - in prison, offer his body for a ""good cause"".

Marcus wakes up amid the battles and finds a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). Together, they make their way towards Skynet and bump into Connor. Reese is captured by the terminators. Marcus infiltrates the machine compound and Connor invades to destroy them once and for all.

Terminator Salvation is a nice addition to the franchise. It gives you a look at some of the things hinted at in the earlier films. It also touts some of the fiercest explosions I have seen in movies.

However it lacks humanity. Which is pretty much the basis of the film. You don't connect with any of the characters and you really don't care who lives and who dies. Obviously you know Connor and Reese will survive this first film (of which the director would like to make 3). But you don't mind watching the other survivors bite it because you really don't care about them.

First thoughts...It's not bad. I was a little worried about this one because it got a PG-13 rating when the first three were all R. It was actually very good though. Here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--Good job from McG (Catwoman). It had a very good camera job, I was impressed.
2.  Script--Good script from the same people who wrote Terminator 3, John Brancato and Michael Ferris.
3.  Acting--Very good. You have an all-star cast. Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Anton Yelchin, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Oh, and let's not be forgetting Michael Ironside.

Now for the content review.
Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language.

1.  Sex/Nudity=2/10. There is a brief scene where a terminator is shown fully nude but his genitals are blurred by smoke.
2.  Violence/Gore=8/10. Even though it got a PG-13, it is still pretty violent.
3.  Language=4/10. Least language of all the Terminator movies. A couple S-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. I enjoyed this one far more than Terminator 3. Still, it would have been better if James Cameron directed it.",1292889600,,1169,5.1

That being said, it's hard for me to watch a Terminator and be... impartial I guess you could say cuz I love this series so damn much. That first Terminator movie was incredible and you were really hoping to see more of the incredible story unfold. After Judgment Day, I would always wonder what the hell happened to the movies?! At the very least, there were plenty of Terminator comics you could follow. I never actually read them cuz I was just a kid and had no idea of there existence until more recently... I've gotten side tracked... Uhhh I read Robocop vs Terminator though. That was awesome. OK back on track: Flash forward some 12 years I see a commercial for another Terminator movie. Well its about damn time. I saw it, thought it was dope few things coulda been done differently but I didn't care. The franchise had finally been revived. So all that side tracking and talking about movies and comics that have nothing to do with the rating of this movie brings me to... this movie. Terminator Salvation. As I was walking out of the theater, I thought it was an incredible movie and they did absolutely no wrong with it. We're finally seeing what we've been waiting to see since Kyle Reese talked about the future way back in the first movie. Now I gotta step back and attempt to impartiality. This is gonna be tough... OK visually; stunning. Bale as John Connor; I've heard it before and I agree. His stoic acting needed to go somewhere. Nothing against him as an actor cuz I enjoy the stuff he's done but I don't feel like he portrayed John Connor the way he should have. Also, its gotta be rough hiding that accent and trying to act a certain way so I'll just chalk it up to that. Ok, the story; Yeah, it was pretty weak.(Spoilers) Exactly what I mean by that is that the machines knowing of Kyle Reese's existence and even capturing him and not offing him that very second didn't make any sense. That would have been the end of everything right there. I have no beef with Marcus' character either. Considering all the changes that happened in the past, it makes sense for something new to emerge in this altered future.

After all, when films change hands, many times the real flow gets lost in the other director's point of view or a prematurely finished film. ""Salvation"" surprisingly doesn't stray too far from what I would call the genuineness of the storyline. A few spots make you cringe a bit because the lines ""come with me if you want to live"" and ""there's no fate by what we make"" are regurgitated in the film. However even though the first half was hard to get into, by the time the movie is 3/4 done, you are sucked in completely. This is not anything like the other Terminator movies, as it is based in the present, not in the past...and it's more of a sci-fi war film than a story-based sci-fi thriller.

The appearance of the Arnold-looking T-800 towards the end nails it down. The first T-800 appears, and it immediately hones in on John Connor. It is indestructable and incredibly merciless. A wonderful foreshadowing of the human-cyborg terminators.

Details are well-scripted, even to the very detail of John Connor's face getting scarred by the Terminator's nails (compare his scars in Terminator 2 at the beginning, when Commander John Connor is lowering his binoculars). The rescue of young Kyle Reese was wonderful, but the introduction of Kyle made him look like a street rat who steals things and vandalizes. All with his little black kid side kick.

I would have appreciated a little more depth, a way to get to know the characters better so you can really connect. This is obviously missing when compared to the work of Cameron in the first two installments.

Story-wise this film is incredible. Compared to the other Terminator films however I was expecting more. It always seems that it would be the new director's point of view on how it really should be.

I think the new director did a good job on this film. Kudos.",1291680000,,1904,4.72289156626506

CGI Arnold worked.

I still think the Sarah Connor Chronicles was vastly deeper and more thoughtful.

I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.
 The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.

The acting is very strong with Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington.  Oddly, Conor's wife, who Danes so superlatively acted in T3, is a peripheral character in this film and poorly done.

Interestingly, I bought this as blu-ray, and I can't say that the picture, with the exception of a few images, is more than marginally better.  There is no unmistakable, quantum improvement over dvds.

3577436,3,B001FB55I0,"The Terminator films have always demanded that its viewers exhibit an above-average ""disbelief suspension.""  Each incarnation of the series up to now has embraced the possibility of time travel with the caveat that only live matter or matter encased in live matter can make the journey (not to mention ""dead"" hair and fingernails attached to live matter).  And, of course, there's the liquid metal introduced in T2 and carried over into T3.  Although there's no time travel in ""Terminator Salvation,"" an above-average suspension of disbelief is still required.

In this outing, John Connor is not ""THE"" resistance leader, but merely ""A"" resistance leader, one who is not even privy to what those at the top of the human food chain are doing or planning.  While on an ill-fated mission at the beginning, he discovers that the machines are kidnapping humans and, later, learns that they are being taken to Skynet HQ in San Francisco.  One of the kidnapped humans, he finds, happens to be Kyle Reese, his father (originally played by Michael Biehn in ""The Terminator"") who is only a teenager in this particular future.  He learns about Kyle from a character named Marcus Wright, played by Sam Worthington, who you'll immediately question the ""humanness"" of, which was probably intentional on the part of the filmmakers.

While the plot of the film is--along with the acting and special effects--worthy enough to make this an above-average sci-fi movie, there are a few details that prompt some head scratching.  In many parts of the movie, gigantic terminators (land-based or airborne) are shown.  With such ""beings"" about, it's a little surprising that any shed in the desert hasn't been pulverized along with just about every other building that could shelter a human.  Add to that the fact that John Connor operates a fairly large resistance base replete with helicopters and fighter jets, all unbeknownst to the high-tech eyes of the machines.

Whether or not you dwell on this type of thing (or notice it to begin with), ""Terminator Salvation""  will probably fit your bill for high-budget, sci-fi action-adventure.  Recommended.",1281312000,3,2130,5.118497109826589

3577481,5,B001FB55I0,"Wow, Terminator Salvation is actually a really exciting movie!  I went in already a big fan of the original three Terminator films, but Terminator Salvation really does a fantastic job continuing with the series.

It's not a secondrate or cheesy attempt in comparison to the previous three Terminator films either- it's actually really darn good.

I admit I mostly like the Terminator films because, well first of all, they are action-packed in a way that's pretty easy to understand and follow.  I simply *enjoy* them.  I know what's going on.  It's not science fiction created in a completely confusing way.  The storyline is what it is- machines are designed to kill humans and take over the world.

Secondly, I feel a LOT of tension whenever I think about humans trying to run away from an enormous, dangerous machine created for the sole purpose of destroying anybody that moves.  I can't tell you how many dreams I've had where I was running and hiding as much as I could ONLY for a huge machine to suddenly show up and force me to continue running.  I love it!

As for Terminator Salvation, there's some really cool additions to the machine creatures.  I really fell in love with the robot snakes (as I like to call them, hehe).  They are actually huge metal claws that hide in the water.

Also, let's not forget the scene out in the desert with that HUGE machine that actually has motorcycles stored as a last resort inside his legs (I kid you not!).  Apparently whenever someone is out of shooting distance for this particular machine, he opens up his legs and sends machines on motorcycles after them.  Awesome!

The storyline is typical affair however.  You *know* what to expect.  There's nothing especially hard to grasp about what's taking place.

Overall, with todays technology and the way Hollywood delivers action flicks these days, the action scenes involving the robots going ballistic is just incredible and seems more believable now than it did in years past.  The same remains true here.  Great movie.",1279929600,3,2024,4.8226744186046515
3577482,1,B001FB55I0,"Besides all of the regular broken things you hear about this movie...

The voice recordings of Sarah Connor were dull and impassive. They sounded like a school teacher discussing apples or oranges for lunch. They lacked a passionate or fiery edge (yes even in their vocies) as shown by Linda Hamilton from T2 or Lena Headey from TSCC? Oh wait, Linda Hamilton's voice was used... and she read her lines how the director wanted her to read them.

John Connor did nothing for this story, his parts could have been all in the background and it wouldn't of impacted the storyline in any way.

Continuity and Common sense were ignored:

Example 1: The T-600 - Kyle Reese said they were covered in rubber skin, which made them easier to spot up close. (Synthetic skin, hair, nails etc. being the last comestic improvements on the Terminator robots - turning them into cyborgs). McG (the director) probably thought he said they were easy to spot because they were 8 or 9 feet tall and had a minigun on one arm. The rubber skin on the movie T-600s was not a disguise at all. It was some rubber sheets draped over their head. I don't honestly believe many pro-wrestlers are EVEN close to being that big or ugly so unless Skynet wanted to infiltrate a Wrestling Federation/Organization it was doing things wrong in Terminator: Salvation.

Example 2: The giant machine which scoops up people from buildings like a fat man grabbing pop-corn... How the hell does something that large sneak up on paranoid people in the future? Especially small communes in the middle of nowhere? Was it wearing a rubber sheet with wrestling tights on?

It has been reported that when the director McG was asked about this film and how it's not up to any kind of standards that he replied with ""it's just a damn dumb summer action, terminator movie, it's not supposed to be cerebral, it's a pop-corn fantasy flick"". No wonder Bill Murray punched him out once.

If you hated T3 remember this about TS: The first full screenplay for the film was written by Terminator 3 writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris.

From Wikipedia:

3577483,5,B001FB55I0,"I went into this flick expecting a big, fat flop.  But what I got was a suspenseful, informative movie with a driving plot, exceptional acting, and a few splashes of memories of sweet days gone by.  I am SO glad that Christian Bale signed up for this one.  His presence was the kicker.

Many movies that are at the fourth installment are bashed by critics and slammed by the masses before they even reach the public eye.  These movies are destined to fail simply because they are preternaturally steeped in ""sequel"" doom and, therefore, expected to fail.  With Christian being there, you know that the entire production team was aiming for quality, and they did not disappoint.  There were many edge-of-your seat moments and plenty of pure suspense to go around.

Even though the scene with Ah-nold in it was computer generated, it was awesome to see him again in a movie.  Actually, it was a bit bittersweet.

Because of the success of ""Terminator: Salvation,"" there has been ANOTHER sequel ordered.  Let's see if they can bring it, yet, once again.

GREAT JOB TO ALL INVOLVED!  MY TERMINATOR HAT IS OFF TO YOU!",1279670400,3,1112,4.699481865284974
3577484,4,B001FB55I0,"You will not recognize the actors, or so little. Even the cameo of Schwarzenegger is computer-generated. The film does not bring much new data. It seems to be mixing time periods, but it does not matter. The machine world has been experimenting a new generation of robots, partly human (brain and heart, etc) and partly machine to infiltrate the resistance. They are capturing human beings now to create that new army of infiltrators. Logical but not revolutionary, my dear Watson, or is it Sherlock Holmes, I was going to say Shakespeare. Then the resistance has been able to devise a signal that can freeze the machines that are always controlled by come kind of wave. Interesting but only experimented at local level.

The new thing though is that the only existing hybrid retains enough humanity to be a machine for the machines, and recognizable as such by them, but with a real loyalty to humans to the point of helping John Connor come into the headquarters of Skynet, the network that controls all the machines, liberate the prisoners there, have a final fight with the impersonation of Schwarzenegger, escape with Kyle Reeves, a key to the future and destroy the place, which is a ""given back"" for a ""given gift"" because the military headquarters of the resistance had been destroyed because they tried to send a general air strike on Skynet in San Francisco, a move which was successfully opposed by John Connor and thus did not happen, but the signal these generals had sent to all units had had the effect of being detected by Skynet who had sent their taskforce to clear the place in one big airstrike.

This episode, that will have to have a sequel since the salvation is not finished yet and has not reached liberation, ends with the hybrid being, Marcus Wright, giving his human heart to John Connor to save him before John Connors dies of his wounds. That human touch, quite in the style of Jesus giving his life to save humanity is going soft on our emotions and that's its main objective. A few tears please. But all together the story has not advanced a lot, except to prepare an eventual next episode that could be at least the first step towards liberation. But frankly the main danger of humanity today is not machines and an eventual take over from them, which would explain the relative flop of this film. It is more the take over the financial tycoons and traders of Wall Street had been able to perform leading the world nearly to the bottom of the abyss, at least to the brink of it.

When I see the anti-machine or anti-technology stand of some in our society particularly among educators, I am amazed. This very week a university professor in education is advising us to take into account as the basis of our reflection the children who only have school at their disposal to acquire school-knowledge. I would like that very acute young man to tell me today what school-knowledge is in the knowledge economy and society, and to point out to me the child (a wolf child I guess, since so far wolves don't have TVs and smart phones) who would have had access to no other source of knowledge than school.

These fake social-climbing-and-politically-minded-though-not-politically-correct-except-with-Trotskyites intellectuals were those who refused to use the radio in class, and then who considered television as the killing challenger of school, and now consider that all communication tools have to be banned from schools and universities, first of all smart phones. Yes there are some in our universities who think smart phones are nothing but a means of cheating.

This ideology is behind the Terminator series, but it is today very pass, very pre-historical, if history started with the GUIs (Graphical Users Interfaces). A highly considered communication expert I read in some paper lately considers that the technological revolution of our time started in the early 1990s. What an ignoramus. I would have sworn the Internet was first successfully tested between Stanford and Oakland, California, in the fall 1969, and that the first GUI was invented by Apple for its first McIntosh, and then by Microsoft with Windows 3.1, both at the beginning of the 1980s. Why should we be afraid of machines? The Matrix was a lot more positive on the subject, even if the tale needs a human sacrifice, a Savior of sorts to conquer peace with machines and to rebut for a while the engineering mind behind it all, behind all the Mr. Smiths of this world.

3577488,5,B001FB55I0,"""Terminator Salvation"" is the beginning of a new saga in the ""Terminator"" franchise which begun in 1984 with James Cameron's hit ""The Terminator"". Directed by McG, this takes place fifteen years after the events of ""Terminator: Rise of the Machines"", which ended with the onslaught of ""Judgment Day"", the day when all the world's machines rose up against humanity.

John Connor, this time played by Christian Bale, is now settled into his prophetized role as Resistance Leader/Only Hope for Humanity against the terminator machines. Yet Connor struggles with his mission as the great emancipator/warrior and Bale shows this internal strife very well. As we get to know Connor and his ragtag group of rebels, we see the two people entering his life who play major roles in his fight: Marcus, played by Sam Worthington, a death row inmate from several years ago who took part in a scientific procedure (which ended up converting him into a human/cyborg hybrid) and Kyle Reese, well portrayed by Anton Yelchin. Reese, of course, one day becomes the father of John in the earlier Terminator mythos, yet John is tasked with finding him and keeping him alive in this alternate time frame.

Though not always as lively, fast paced as the earlier Schwarzenegger films, T-S has a few well produced set pieces (for example: the road/bridge chase involving Marcus, Reese and a couple of terminator/motorcycles; the capture of rebels by a 20 ft harvester/terminator; and Connor's battle with a Schwarzenegger cyborg lookalike). The aftermath of Judgment Day has led to his new chapter in Connor's life and his fulfillment as a savior of humanity and it somehow still works without the presence of Schwarzenegger, simply because it takes the story in a different direction and adds new layers to the original mythology.

The Film looks great on Blu-ray: Strong visuals and a clear soundtrack do enough to enhance McG's vision. A very good addition to one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made.",1277683200,2,1977,5.021341463414634

That film was released at a time where critics complained about the lack of a strong narrative and not enough substance.  I think this film befell a similar fate and was widely dismissed upon release.  Well I loved every minute of this film from the opening frame and waited over 6 months for the Blu-ray release.  This movie is not only highly entertaining but also touches upon the ideas that make us human.  I think after the Cristian Bale rant was somehow released a lot of the critics and audiences failed to appreciate his performance and considered this movie to be a mindless action film.  It's funny that the Transformers movie came out a little after this movie and was really panned (rightly so) for being a mindless exercise.  This film at least builds upon the previous mythology and creates several new interesting characters such as the Sam Worthington character who is only looking for a second chance.  At the end of the day I think in years to come this film will be given a second chance and will be appreciated for it's strong narrative, brilliant casting, wonderful cinematography, creative action scenes and strong direction.

This wasn't a movie where I was tempted to hit the fast forward button.  The action scenes are reasonably compact and progress the plot rather than simply being there for violence alone.

3577529,1,B001FB55I0,"In terms of big Hollywood movies, I feel like there are 2 kinds of bad movies: (1) There's the type of bad movie that has the sheen of being good just b/c it has an A-list director and actors and smothers the viewer with big words and an overly ""serious"" tone and lots of emoting, but deep down is as empty as an abandoned building, for example, THE DARK KNIGHT! That movie is nothing and I freely gave it only 1 star. (2) Then there's the type of bad movie that is so in-your-face BAD that it can't be denied and TERMINATOR SALVATION is THAT movie! Ironically, both movies star Christian Bale (who plays John Connor in this) and guess what? There's a strong connection, b/c just like in TDK, in TERMINATOR SALVATION, Bale also uses the SAME raspy voice again...WOW!

I knew TERMINATOR:SALVATION (TS for short) was doomed from the start, opening in 2003 (pre-apocalypse) with a character and story that seemed totally disconnected from all the previous Terminator films. And I KNEW that in the end, the explanation would not make any sense and be a total violation of all that had been established in the first 3 Terminator movies: just another fancy Hollywood gimmicky ""twist"" ending designed for shock value, and it wasn't even that shocking as the ""twist"" had already been spoiled in the trailers. This character is condemed criminal Marcus Wright (played by newcomer Sam Worthington) and the movie opens with him on death row about to be executed, but not before he signs away his body to be donated to a cancer-stricken Cyberdyne scientist (played by Helena Bonham Carter).

The post title scene introduces us to John Connor (Bale) and I've got to say that I think that Bale is the WORST portrayal of John Connor in all the films! I actually didn't like Furlong that much in T2 as he was cliche, but I think Bale is worse than the kid. Nick Stahl in T3 is the best portrayal by far. Bale spends the whole movie rasping, grunting, yelling, ""thinking"" and it is annoying to watch. In fact, I dare say that Bale himself seems to almost be in a separate movie from everyone else...that is how disconnected his story is. While all other actors feel like part of the movie (albeit not a very good one!), Bale appears to be in his own world above all the proceedings.

Worthington's Marcus Wright is the real main character and the movie tracks his story until it intersects with Connor's, leading to the climax and conclusion. Wright's tale is the standard by-the-numbers fare with him trying to find the source of his troubles in 2018 post-apocalyptic California. Along the way, he meets the basic crew of cliche characters: the scrappy, green teenager who needs a push in the right direction Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, who actually gives a good performance among a sea of bad ones!), the little girl who doesn't speak (Newt from ALIENS, anyone?), the hot, tough-as-nails female who can take care of herself (Moon Bloodgood, obviously a fashion model in real life!), etc. Worthington is just OK as Wright, but he doesn't have to speak much. He plays the typical monosyllabic summer action movie hero who is more brawn than brains. In fairness to him and all the actors, the dialogue is atrocious and the plot thin.

Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter who seems to get a lot of thankless roles) plays John's wife Kate Brewster Connor (character was introduced in T3 played convincingly by Clare Danes). An issue I had was with the age of Kate...In T3, Kate was to be in her early-to-mid-20s or so, but in TS, it is now 15 years later and Howard actually looks younger than Danes did in T3?! I even think Bale is a little too young-looking to play Connor. In fact, all the characters are too ""clean"" in appearance to be living in indefinite subhuman conditions. And Bale and Howard don't have near the chemistry that Stahl and Danes did in T3. In T3, even in the short span of time it was set, the John-Kate relationship was convincingly established, but here they seem like complete strangers just thrown together and they've been together for 15 FREAKIN YEARS!

Also, where is the colorful, evocative, eternal nighttime setting that was so well-established in the future flashback/flashforward montages in all the previous Terminator films? In TS, 99.9% of the scenes are daylight and the cinematography is very off-putting and dreary-looking. Not to mention that the human resistance seems to have an endless supply of weapons to fight what few Terminators we get to actually see! There's supposed to be armies of machines, but instead, we get conveniently timed Terminators (one of which looks suspiciously like a robot from TRANSFORMERS!) and most of which look to be different in design...I thought all the early models (the T600s) were supposed to look the same?

The biggest faux pas though involves the subplot (or main plot, not sure which!) of Kyle Reese (who really shouldn't be introduced this soon) and why Skynet even knows of the connection between him and John Connor. Also, I found the climactic action scenes at Skynet uninteresting and convoluted, including how it was so easy for Connor to infiltrate the facility with little resistance (the sole purpose of machines is to track humans 24 hours a day but they can't take out ONE human in their own headquarters?) and of course the not-so-shocking revelation about Wright and his predictable actions thereafter.

TS, in general, just seems to be a patched together flick with big budget special effects (that aren't that impressive to me), a franchise-killing plot, and terrible dialogue. I say, ""Do-over, please?!""",1274140800,11,5594,4.8087318087318085
3577570,5,B001FB55I0,Blu Ray is the only way to watch this movie...excellent sound with surround sound setup and the picture is extra crisp.,1273190400,,119,4.714285714285714
3577571,1,B001FB55I0,"I had high hopes, like many, going into this film. As a fan of the franchise, I was looking forward to that ""blown out of my seat"" experience the other films of this saga have given me. Besides which, this is the film we've all been waiting for since the beginning, right? The future war! The resistance vs. Skynet! It couldn't possibly be bad, could it? Oh, you couldn't be more wrong!

This film lacked anything in the way of atmosphere or suspense. The mood of the film was extremely flat from almost the start and never really came to life. On top of that, I feel too much time was spent on the machines and not enough on John Connor and the humans (whom you'd think we should be rooting for). Sam Worthington's character, of the man made into a machine, never gained any sympathy or interest from me. The fact they gave away the ""secret"" to his character in the trailers, certainly didn't help that, either. His character's actions are schizophrenic, at best, half the time making little sense, if any, and almost never ring true. A major flaw, to be sure, with how much time he gets on screen.

Then you have Christian Bale, who plays John Connor as a ""Batman-lite"" affair. He uses the same kind of voice here, that he did in ""The Dark Knight"" and it just doesn't work. He portrays none of the charisma and leadership that we know the character is supposed to have. All the emotions we've felt for him in the past are all stripped away here, as he comes off like a whiny and self-absorbed jerk. Hardly one you'd want being the savior of the human race. None of the other resistance members get enough screen time to make any kind of impression on you, so you never develop any bond in what might happen to them. I don't know if the cast just didn't care about the film, or if the script just gave them nothing to work with, but there is no fire in any of the performances.

And even if the script doesn't let the actors down, it has more than a few problems itself. They never really explain why Sam Worthington's character is the one chosen by Skynet. The story never gives you any feelings of dread or panic, despite tons of action on the screen. And while those action sequences are well shot and choreographed, they lack any real excitement. It never gets your pulse pounding. Plus there are tons of little things in the film, like Connor's wife being pregnant, which get no explanation or even a passing mention. I mean, what's the point in doing that, if it doesn't mean anything? And why is Skynet herding people into camps (ala the Nazis)? Shouldn't it simply be destroying all human life, to protect itself and win the war? It is another plot point that makes no sense, nor is given any reasoning for, in a script filled with them.

Worst of all, and the one major flaw that ruins the whole film for me, is how, after Skynet has captured Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, in one of the few decent performances in the film), it doesn't kill him immediately, but uses him as bait to lure John Connor into a rescue mission. This kind of thinking, in terms of revenge and greed, is an emotional human failing Skynet should not have. It is a machine. It should know the simple equation: ""Kill Kyle Reese, John Connor is no more!"" The only reason for it, is to provide the big end battle, where Connor faces the Terminator 101-model (with CGI used to show Arnold in his prime). It's all just a waste and doesn't deliver any thrills.

Many folks blasted ""T3"" for some of the inconsistencies it had, but compared to this mess of a film, it was sheer cinematic brilliance! ""Terminator Salvation"" could truly be considered a franchise killer, on par with the fiasco that ""Batman and Robin"" was for the Batman one. Old school fans of this saga will not find this enjoyable, and any attempts to bring in new fans will be dashed at the overly-complicated back-story used to get them up to speed on this film. In short, this is a film that will appeal to few people, be they fans of these films or not. It is a complete waste of time, money and talent. And that is the purest definition of the term ""whipped up movie,"" which this effort most assuredly is, that I can think of!",1272499200,4,4180,4.416342412451362
3577572,4,B001FB55I0,"""Terminator: Salvation"" is a worthy addition to the franchise, featuring great state-of-the-arts special effects, an engaging storyline, and strong performances.

Speaking of the latter, Sam Worthington has the more sympathetic part of a man, ripped from his criminal and murderous past to become a heroic figure of the future.  Worthington balances ""butt-kicking"" with emotional vulnerability that certainly make his the more memorable character to star Christian Bale's ""John Conner.""

""Star Trek's"" Anton Yelchin is also surprisingly good as the young Kyle Reese, managing to downplay his native Russian accent that he purposely ""overplayed"" in the Trek film.

Welcome ""appearances"" are made by both Linda Hamilton - in the form of a photograph and voiceover - and Arnold himself in a rather computer-generated way.",1272067200,,818,5.626016260162602
3577573,5,B001FB55I0,"This is a great addition to the Terminator series. Great story line which sets it post Judgement Day in Western California(Los Angeles, San Francisco, places in between) But was actually all filmed in Arizona which helped with the barren desert landscape design. You also really get a good look at the many designs of machines in this film which James Cameron didn't have the time to get into detail in Judgement Day. T-1s, T-600s, T-700s, T-800s, Hunter Killers, Moto-Terminators, The Harvester, you name it...this movie has it. Now actorwise, Christian Bale(The Dark Knight) as John Conner is for sure a lot better than the guy who played John in Rise of the Machines, very bad ass with a REAL desire to kill the machines and save his father, Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin(Star Trek). Then...finally...Sam Worthington(Avatar) as Marcus Wright...oh my god...I tell you, if Sam Worthington didn't play this role I don't know who would have. In 2003 Marcus Wright is on death row for killing 2 cops and his brother, he donates his body to Cyberdyne after his execution for experiments. He is then awakened in 2018 as a one of a kind infiltration prototype terminator which befriends an A-10 pilot, Blair Williams played by Moon Bloodgood(Street Fighter) and a love story forms after Marcus saves her multiple times. You will find out that Marcus Wright is the key to get John Connor into Skynet to save his father from being terminated.

3577574,4,B001FB55I0,"I'm a huge fan of the Terminator series and I saw this movie on the midnight premier when it was released in theaters! I loved the movie, it's something I was wanting to see for a long time, a movie about the future war against skynet. Christian Bale did a great John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright was great too! The movie stayed very true to the previous 3 movies and stuck to the time line way better then T3 did.... When I entered the movie theater, I didn't have any great expectations though, because I'm not a fan of Mc G's previous movies and didn't really think he could pull it off, but he did it. There's been a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but trust me, if you are a true Terminator fan, you are going to love this movie! The action scenes are great, the plot is familiar and also has a little something that feels new and fresh. The actors / actresses did a great job in their rolls and the machines were amazing!
I personally think this is the best Terminator movie since T2 and I give the movie 5 stars out of 5, but now to the DVD review.....

The Special edition DVD is good, but honestly could've been better and I'm still kind of trippin cuz Mc G promised us a 30-40 minute longer version a long with a bunch of special features, but instead we got about a 20 minute ""making of"" documentary and a few other extras, not much at all... The Blu-Ray I still haven't seen, but I've heard that there's a few more extras that I wish they would've added. I'm glad I didn't go buy the regular DVD, because the regular DVD just has the PG-13 movie and no extras and that is really screwing fans over IMO.
Anyway if you're a REAL Terminator fan, I suggest you add this to your collection, don't mind what the dumb critics say about this movie, because honestly this is one of the best action movies I've seen in a very long time and a great addition to the Terminator franchise.

To my additional suprise Sam Worthington (whom I had never seen before) in my opion was as good (if not better than) Christian Bale in his role as Marcus Wright.

The unfathomable star power of Christian Bale, whose last credible performance was the lead in Empire of the Sun, was exploited to the hilt here. Bale has evolved perfect mastery of two acting modes, and only two: incoherent muttering and incoherent screaming.

3577579,3,B001FB55I0,"This fourth installment of the Terminator franchise simply isn't as good as the original ""Terminator"" or ""Terminator 2"".  But there are some interesting parts within the film, and some great action sequences.  The blu-ray itself has high-quality picture and sound.  There are two discs in this set.  One disc is the Theatrical Cut of the film.  This version also has the Warner Bros. Maximum Movie Mode feature (similar to the ""Watchmen"" blu-ray), which allows viewers to watch the film with commentary by the director.  There is also picture-in-picture features and a pop-up timeline.  Also, there are several branching ""focus points"", which allow you to pause the film and jump to a short featurette on some aspect of the film's production.  The problem is that there is too much waiting time in between pop-up segments.  You are often left waiting one or two minutes between each interactive feature, leaving you just watching the film.  A lot more information could have been put into the Maximum Movie Mode.

Another disappointment is the second disc, or the ""Director's Cut"", which only features an additional 3 minutes of footage.  The changes made are barely noticeable, and don't add anything more to the story.  And just so you know, this set does not include the DVD version nor does it have a digital copy.

Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day.

3577601,4,B001FB55I0,"I was reading some bad reviews about this movie, and I was a bit amazed.

The CGI to me it was pretty good, at least I liked it better than the Terminator 3 CGI...

Some people said it had many plotholes but I really didn't see them, we didn't know much about the story about Kyle and John becoming a leader, etc...

Some of the reviews I read were also complaining for things they either didn't understand or didn't pay enought attention, or simply didn't know some things and just criticized for the sake of it.

One HUGE mistake that I notice constantly that people make, is when they go to see a movie with a preovious expectation...

If you go to see a movie thinking it's going to be awesome (or at least thinking it might be similar to ""something"") you're probably gonna exit the theater dissapointed... As how it happens if you don't know what to expect of a movie and you end up liking it (sometimes you go see a movie thinking it will suck and when you finish it, you keep thinking the same, but that's just the mistake of going to see that movie with a fixed expectation of failure)

Overall I liked the movie, the acting wasn't anything amazing, but it was enough for this movie, and the story of Marcus I found it to be interesting and well adapted into the idea of the movie.

Finally, I think that people who went to see this movie and didn't like it is because they were expecting another terminator, like the previous ones, or simply was expecting to be dissapointed and got what they hoped for, but still it's a good story, maybe not a huge story, but an important part of the mythology IMO, it added new things to our knowledge, it confirmed others and just played with information we already knew just for the viwer's pleasure...",1268524800,,1749,4.396284829721362

All in all I gave it 3 stars. Then again my views might also have been affected by my physical condition while watching the movie, as I have recently injured my back, and been laid up for over a week.

3577605,3,B001FB55I0,"Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation, one of which is much more interesting than the other.  Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements, but a later writing team couldn't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense.  The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood, as well as Yelchin, and is the more interesting of the two.  The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film, and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we haven't before.  The second movie stars Christian Bale, and is not nearly as interesting.  In many ways, John Connor is essentially along for the ride.  I don't understand this, given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance, and a charismatic leader; you'd think he'd be the focus of the movie.  Bale's Connor is bland and unapproachable, through no fault of Bale; the script gives him very little to work with.

On the bright side, there isn't much here that's going to tick you off if you're a fan of the Terminator movies, unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV.  On the down side, after it's over, my reaction was ""huh, so that was it,"" instead of, ""that was really cool.""  When a movie with killer robots, time travel, Helena Bonham Carter, a nuclear war, and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response, it has failed in its mission.

There are iconic lines, a weird looking Arnie, Linda Hamilton's voice (sorta), and the actors do what they can with the material; calling it cheesy dialog is an insult to cheese.

Picture is very good even in most of the darker scenes, and the digital grading used to make most of the movie look greyish is well done.
The sound dept  for the Dolby Digital 5.1 Mix is excellent, great use of surrounds and Subwoofer which should be expected with an Action movie.

Sure, it's driven, to a degree, by special effects and action with choice little bits tossed to long-time fans, but I found it to be an entertaining, well-made film.  And the story is good also.  Foretold leader of the resistance against the machines John Connor (Christian Bale) is NOT the main character; though his role is not insignificant (or poorly acted, in my opinion).  The film focuses more on the newly-introduced character Marcus Wright (as portrayed by Sam Worthington); whose part in the film serves as an interesting standard for comparison against the John Connor that survived Judgement Day and has seen war.  I'd say Terminator Salvation is not about metallic, single-minded killing machines, great action, or obligatory explosions; though it certainly is not lacking in these things.  It's ultimately a story about moral responsibility, strength of character, and - humanity.  These subjects play out from the perspective of Marcus as well as Connor, and neither character comes off as one-dimensional.

Really I'm making more of an attempt to avoid spoiling the film than I am to exaggerate its themes; it is, boiled down to basics, a solid action film fueled by great special effects.  The ""Terminator"" is still a unique and frightening ""movie monster,"" and John Connor is a brave man struggling against seemingly impossible odds.  Add to the mix Marcus Wright, a man with a shameful past and an unexpected second chance, and you have a worthwhile film with characters in which you want to believe and follow throughout the course of the storyline.  Yes, I've been fairly vague, but I encourage anyone that has so much as even considered seeing the film to give it a chance.  And anyone who just plain appreciates well-done action, movie magic, or creepy human-exterminating robots from the future (I know I do) shouldn't pass up Terminator Salvation either.

Now that I've done my best to make a case for this movie, I'll address something else: with the blu-ray version (I can not speak for the DVD version) you get both the PG-13 theatrical version of the film and the R-rated ""director's cut.""  Having watched both, I'll say that the PG-13 version isn't really less-satisfying, and the R-rated version didn't seem to add so much ""adult"" content as to even warrant the upped rating.  I'd say that all three of the previous Terminator films were bloodier.  Of course, this film (unlike its predecessors) is more action than thriller, so it makes sense.  And the ""worst"" thing added to the R-rated version of Salvation is some brief (and not especially showy) female nudity.",1265673600,2,2841,4.983050847457627

It's fair to say that most everyone has a favorite movie franchise they like to geek-out on. As I am no exception, the Terminator series has always been my favorite. Unfortunately for me, I'll have to pretend Terminator Salvation doesn't exist.

The futuristic post-apocalyptic side of this story is indeed long over do; but making a Terminator film without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is like making Jaws without a shark. Throw in the facts that James Cameron walked away from the franchise (that he started, I might add), two films ago; and that this is the first installment to be watered-down to a PG - 13 rating; and it seems absurdly pointless. Nevertheless, the film exists anyway.

It's been six years since we left John Connor and Kate Brewster in a fall-out shelter at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You would think the look of the Terminator would only improve with time, but you'd be sadly mistaken. For whatever reason, yet again, a character that was visually perfected years ago (1984), has now shown up computer generated.

I ask the redundantly un-answered question again, with a breath of desperate annoyance - WHY? Why does Hollywood continuously feel the need to take amazing characters and transform them into computer generated pieces of garbage? George Lucas did it to his very own Yoda, nearly twenty years after he looked more than real in 1980; so why should I even be surprised anymore? Rumor has it there is to be a remake of Spielberg's classic, Jurassic Park. At first I was excited, but will God actually allow them to do the T-Rex with CGI (computer graphic imagery)? Let's hope not.

As if using CGI wasn't bad enough; did they really need to make the new Terminators appear to have some sort of physical birth defect to their face? Why are their heads so small? If you haven't seen the film and don't know what I'm talking about, check out the cover of the single disc DVD. If the filmmakers aren't going to take their own movie seriously, how do they expect us to as audience members?

The character of John Connor has not once been played by the same actor in any of the four films. This time, Christian Bale gets a shot, and surprisingly was the worst Connor yet. Bale plays Connor with less human emotion than the Terminators have. And I'm not sure if they began shooting a few scenes of this while he was wrapping up with The Dark Knight; but he randomly has the same annoying scratchy voice he had as Batman! What is the deal?

The problem with the Terminator movies is that you really need to have an open mind when it comes to the plot. They ask us to buy that John Connor had his father Kyle Reese sent back through time, to save his mother Sara Connor, from a pesky Terminator. If you go with it, it's a lot of fun. If you stop and dwell on it though, it will give you a splitting headache. For the sake of this review, we'll just go with it.

In this one, we are in the future nearly the entire time; with the exception of the first few minutes, where we start back in 2003. We meet a new character named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Marcus is on death-row. For dark personal reasons to be revealed later in the film, he volunteers the use of his body to research, for Cyberdynde Systems (the company that generated Skynet - a stream of computers that became self aware and created the Terminators, thus causing Judgment Day).

From there, we jump to 2018 in the middle of the nuclear holocaust between what few humans remain alive, and the self aware nightmare Skynet. John Connor is the only survivor in an attack and stumbles across Skynet's hidden secret: a massive assembly line of T-800 Terminators. Schwarzenegger's brand, in case you were wondering.

Connor delivers the message to his chain of command. They plan on taking Skynet out, based on data that leads them to believe they can stop the hellish machines, with some sort of signal.

Where did this signal come from? Who knows? Why didn't they use this signal to begin with instead of the excessive sending back through time drama? Because this is the third sequel and let's face it, they're reaching. Folks, that's the best explanation I have for you.

Something I could not figure out for the life of me, no matter how many times I re-round the DVD; was why the character of Marcus goes skipping across a river like a thrown rock. He falls from a bridge that has been blown up (which looked awesome, by the way), and then sure enough, goes skipping down the river, bouncing like a ragdoll. Aside from bad directing and editing, what could have possibly caused this to happen?

Also, in the scene with John Connor and Marcus sharing a conversation in the water, everything seems to be hatched out quite nicely between the two of them when Marcus turns to leave. So why on earth does Connor scream at him angrily, ""What are you?"" Was this accidently placed in the film out of order? On the day when Christian Bale lost his cool with that sound guy, perhaps?

Whether you're a fan of the series or not, Sam Worthington will be the most rewarding element the film has to offer you. By now, you surely know him from Avatar (ironically also generated from the mind of James Cameron). He is a true gift to action-movie fans: a guy who can play the butt-kicking hero, while being able to act extraordinarily well. You won't find too many of those.

Had it not tried to be a Terminator film, it may have been a little better. The action is intense and the cinematography is breath-taking. We see some really cool new machines that were done very well with CGI. But this only made me question again, why the Terminators looked so horrible.

Perhaps the most disappointing part of the film was its ridiculously un-original third act. If you've seen the first two films, then you've already seen the ending to Terminator Salvation.

Remember when the T-100 was first frozen and then sent into a vat of hot liquid metal at the end of Terminator 2: Judgment Day? Same thing happens to a Terminator in the climax here; only in reverse order. And do you recall in The Terminator, when they had that climatic showdown amidst all of those machines, and Sarah Connor went toe-to-toe with the Terminator; and there was the suspense of the Terminator climbing up the stairs and her having no-where to go? Yeah, well if you don't, it's all here again for you; nearly frame for frame.

This may be considered a SPOILER, to some, but I like to think of it as more of a friendly courtesy; to point out that they also CGI'd Arnold's face onto the body of another actor, for a cameo. I guess these filmmakers didn't realize the technology that now exists to digitally reduce wrinkles and make someone look incredibly younger; as used in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. They didn't have to make Arnold look like he did in the first two films, either. All they had to do was take off six years; he looked great in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. Guys, come on.

If I had to guess, they probably did this because they weren't able to get Arnold on-board, with their poor excuse for a script. And of course Arnold would have had to train insanely to get his body back to where it was; as he did for the third film. But if that's the case, then you don't use a shot of Arnold at all, hello! You come up with something else, original. Why do these huge studios and directors insist on settling for crap? Crap may very well be cheaper, but it's not as appealing to the eye.",1265500800,3,7813,4.576950608446672

It could have been eliminated at the script stage and the heart transplant in a tent is just ridiculous...

With the exception of a few interesting action scenes, and decent acting by Christian Bale, there's not much new in TERMINATOR SALVATION. The only exception is that we're fully immersed in the post-apocalyptic world and not time-traveling into the past ... which is why it got two stars from me instead of one.

I do love Christian Bale's acting chops. He is, to me, the complete action hero. His&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Knight/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;performance cemented that. But you need more to make a good movie, and Terminator Salvation fails to give us a new (or even interesting) storyline. What's more alarming is that rumors are circulating that a Terminator 5 film is being considered. Oh boy. Perhaps it's time to lay this series to rest. I'm not saying that T5 will be bad, but if the track record for this series remains unchanged, then we won't be in for a highly successful sequel.

If you're familiar at all with any of the other three Terminator movies, you're aware of John Connor (played here by Christian Bale), the quintessential hero against the thinking machines; machines that have brought mankind to near extinction. In T4 we stay firmly in the future, fighting the crazed machine-made mankillers (with the exception of a brief stint in the present that rapidly moves us forward) and discovering that Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, AVATAR) - a man from the past awakened in the future - has become a weapon for the machines by being an unawares accomplice in trying to eradicate the human population. When his true identity as a machine is finally revealed, it is as much a surprise to him as to the ""humans."" With the help of a young and feisty Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B001AVCFK6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>), Marcus fights his way through the machines and into the safety of the humans. Here we see him battle with the knowledge of his new internal, metallic identity, and throw himself into the war. But who's side is he really on? This is ""The Big Question"" that the audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes ""The Right Choice.""

In addition to being a clich, the movie even reinvents a scene from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B001RIY4WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>&nbsp;in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free. Been there. Done that. Let's move on people!

The final word I have on this film is that it really doesn't do what it should, which is to show us a great story about characters we've come to know through cinema. But instead, we got a rehashing of old themes with a bit of action eye-candy. Not much to it, really.",1263859200,2,2969,5.545253863134658

Is it b/c Arnold is no longer there, except in the cgi form (which I thought looked really fake and they couldve left out) or perhaps b/c James Cameron didn't direct it? Personally I judge it on its own accord (new actors/new director) rather than comparing it to previous Terminator movies.

I liked Mr. Bale as Connor, he did a pretty good job. I liked the story line w/ Marcus revolting and helping to save Connor and the resistance and Connor risking everything to save his teenage future dad from skynet. The action scenes were really intense and the movie does have a modern/futuristic feel to it which is cool. Although I wish the movie was longer, 1 hr 45 minutes(approx.) just seems too short in my opinion, it would've been better say at 2hrs 15 minutes or so and thus allowed for a bit more depth & character development. I don't like the clean PG-13 rating. I would like it to be more violent, bloody, gory, gritty, etc. staying true to a real war situation.

3577807,2,B001FB55I0,"This review is for the unrated extended blu-ray version. Plenty of spoilers so read at your own discretion. Although, my expectations for this movie were pretty low to begin with, since the movie wasn't directed by James Cameron and T3 wasn't as good as T2, I was at least expecting something that would extend the terminator storyline and mythology from the television show The Sarah Connor Chronicles (which was an excellent TV series) and from the comics. Unfortunately, the people who wrote the script for this movie and the director, McG are completely ignorant and clueless when it comes to the entire Terminator canon. Nothing in this movie makes any sense when you consider the previous three films. It's like these people just threw out everything from the first three films and then started making up stuff as they went along without any thought into what came before or the history that Cameron created.

First, in this movie the machines all know who John Connor is which makes no sense if you follow the history. The audience is so used to the idea that Skynet knows all about Connor that this error usually passes over them without any thought, but what they forget is that only the machines from the future know who Connor is and only because of what he WILL accomplish in the future. He hasn't done ANYTHING yet. All the terminators from the previous films were from the future while the machines in this movie are in the present. The machines have just wiped out most of humanity and now sees them nothing more than a bunch of insects to finish exterminating. Connor at this point is just another insect so this idea that he is somehow important to them is ludicrous. Don't give me this crap about him being seen as a prophecy or messiah either.

Second mistake is that the machines all know who Kyle Reese is which provides one of the biggest plot holes in this movie and goes against even common sense. The entire purpose of the first movie was that the machines didn't know who the father was so their only alternative was to terminate the mother which is why they built the damn time machine in the first place, in order to wipe out his entire existence. In fact information about the father was so secretive that not even Kyle Reese knew it. If the machines know who Kyle Reese is then why the hell would they even bother building the time machine when Connor's very existence depends on it? How the hell are they going to explain that in future sequels if there will be one? This is a massive disaster of a plot hole that can't be overlooked and can't be explained. It's idiotic. And don't give me this crap about alternate timelines or other theories on time travel that's different from the one used in Back to the Future. The rules of time travel and the theory used from the first trilogy have already been in place which is the Back to the Future scenario so you just don't make up new rules and change the canon to suit your logic. That's similar to that idiotic scene from AVP Requiem when the Predalien lays eggs inside pregnant women for the sole purpose of increasing the alien infestation. Only the damn queen lays eggs, stupid! And that still wouldn't explain why Skynet builds the time machine in the future either!

Third plothole is when Skynet captures Kyle Reese they don't decide to execute him right then and there but instead have some kind of elaborate plot in order to lure Connor to execute him. Does this make any sense? What the hell was McG (what the hell kind of name is this) and the writers thinking when they came to this scene? Forget about your stupid theories on time travel when you can't apply it here (see second plot hole). This is so blatantly stupid that words can't describe the idiocy behind it. Who writes this stuff and not see the inherent problems with it?

Fourth problem was when Connor arrives the T800, instead of breaking Connor's neck decides to play ball with him by throwing him around. I thought T800s have detailed files on human anatomy and how to efficiently terminate humans. You'd think that having their biggest sought out target within their grasp they'd kill him as quickly as possible and with a gun instead of a naked unarmed Arnold.

Fifth problem comes at the end when they need to do a heart transplant on John, using Marcus's heart. This scene was supposedly changed due to leakage of the original script but it still doesn't excuse it's sloppiness. This scene requires that Marcus is an acceptable donor, plenty of immunosuppressive drugs, a heart surgeon and a team of anesthetics and not a veterinarian, and a sterile environment instead of the open desert. I was cringing at this scene and thank God it didn't last very long.

Now as for the movie itself, if you are completely ignorant of the previous three films this movie would be somewhat entertaining for the action scenes alone which were very thrilling. But the audience doesn't really care about any of the characters except for maybe Marcus so the movie become nothing more than one action set piece after another. There's really no character development or insight into who these people are and why we should care about them. What made T2 and other movies like it so successful is that we get to know the characters where the audience have an emotional investment so we are concerned about them and anxiously curious about what will happen next. The action is there to supplant the characters not drive them. This movie should have been about how John Connor becomes leader of the Resistance and help humanity come back from the brink of extinction instead of this goofball storyline filled with plot holes. I won't bother going into the special features on the blu-ray or the deleted scenes which have already been discussed. I'll just add that the video transfer is impeccable and the audio is excellent as well and is what is expected from blu-ray by now.

In conclusion, if you are expecting forgetful mindless action, explosions with killer robots, and don't necessarily care about character development or plot then this movie is adequate. But if you are a fan of the terminator franchise then you will be sorely disappointed from the glaring plot holes, mistakes, and literal lack of respect for the mythology and the fan base. It's comparable to George Lucas using midichlorians to explain the Force. Much like having top tiered actors in The Phantom Menace, not even Christian Bale aka Batman can save this turkey. Time to terminate this franchise or return it back to Cameron.",1263427200,3,6542,4.693379790940766

Skulls all over the ground, people living underground, terminators lurking around every corner.  Its awesome bc i always loved those scenes in the first one.  the story is about a guy in jail who got the death penalty and hes signs to give his body over to science, but instead later in the future he wakes up to realize hes a terminator.  he meets up with john conners dad kyle reese, who is younger than he is, as they try to get away from the terminators.  Later kyle convinces the terminator guy (i forget his name at the moment) to meet up with john and they also meet up with a beautiful woman and they fall for each other.  when they finally meet up with john and he realizes the guy is a terminator he has trouble trusting him and locks him up.  but the woman rescues him and then to prove hes a good guy he tries to help find kyle reese who gets kidnapped by the bad termiators.  anyway you must see it if you're a fan of sci fi movies or the terminator movies, and who isn't right?",1263427200,,1252,4.132231404958677

  but there were 2 things i really wanted.the first was to not have to wait a decade in between parts.the second was to see the actual man vs machine war.a whole movie dedicated to just that and not existing only in flashes and memories.
  well,here it is! it only took about 5 years,maybe less and the war is on! i really liked this movie a lot.it is not nearly as good as the first 3,but it is definately a good movie.
  i didn't like a few things but they are minor.one was that i kept seein john connor as bruce wayne.a silly quirk i know. 2 of the main characters looked a lot alike.it confused me a bit.the only real issue i had with the story was the innefficient death camp.
  john connor,the best hope for mankind and terminator hater extrordinaire,makes a deal with a terminator.that rubbed me the wrong way.hes supposed to hate them so much.
  i also didn't like that arnold swarzanegger was in the movie.he was ranked as the number one enemy against guns in the u.s. .  now the hypocrite plays in a movie full of guns?ive lost all respect for that guy.

Yep, that's right, we have a guy with almost no experience in film directing a film in a franchise that's very easy to screw up: Terminator. And you know something's up when T3, which was also a piece of crap, starts looking like a good movie in comparison to the newest crappy entry in the series.

Christian Bale is in this movie, which is unfortunately a missed opportunity as well. It's no wonder he had a meltdown on the set of this movie- nobody can blame him. This movie is pure muck. I saw this on opening weekend, and walked away as satisfied as much as I was when seeing ""9"" (in other words, not satisfied). Like I mentioned before, this is a very easy franchise to f--k up, and McG did just that.

There's literally nothing to spoil in here. There's basically no plot except something about protecting the universe. The action scenes are very poorly done, with the shaky camera and quick cutting (WHEN WILL DIRECTORS STOP SHAKING THE GODDAMN CAMERA!!!!!!). I could hardly tell what was going on. The acting is awful- except for the excellent performance by Anton Yelchin, who is someone I don't usually like. But even he can't save the movie from sucking out loud. And Sam Worthington is a wasted opportunity here- he was AMAZING in Avatar, and horrible in this too... also, I'm a real Bonham-Carter fanboy, yet she even sucked in this too. The dialogue is terrible (""We have won the battle, but we haven't won the war""??? I think I heard that on an episode of Power Rangers). Yep, you guessed it, this movie sucks out loud.

3577863,2,B001FB55I0,"I bought this movie because I really like the Terminator series and wanted to see what that they have done with the storyline.  I was supremely disappointed.  While there are some good special effects, they are primarily composed of motorcycle and truck chase scenes that quickly become monotonous.  The storyline is dull and unimaginative, so much so that it's easy to stop paying attention and loose focus in the midst of one spectacular explosion after another.  It would have been nice if there was a strong story and the action sequences served to further the story, but sadly this is simply a special effects movie without a good plot.  At the end, once you realize it's finally over you're left wondering, ""what just happened?""  They clearly left the door open for another Terminator movie, but this one was so bad that I have no anticipation to see the next chapter.  What a waste of money.",1263081600,2,898,4.754838709677419
3577864,2,B001FB55I0,"I am glad that I did not waste money on this film (got it from Redbox - free night's rental).  The story line was confusing.  The film didn't really explain (unless I drifted off during the explanation) how the main characters got to the past or present or whatever time they were in.  The main character was in the movie with his father who was just a teenager at one point.  I'm not sure if the son traveled to the past or if the father was in the future.

I don't know what kind of scardy cats watched this film and wrote reviews, but I didn't think the robots were scary/creepy at all.  The plot was so predictable that you couldn't possibly be scared because you knew what was going to happen already.

Anyway, it is something to watch on a cold night, especially if you want to complete the series.  Although, I don't think any of the original characters are in there.  One of the robots at the end did look like Arnold (a well built Arnold lol), but it wasn't long before he was reduced to his metal skeleton.

3577865,4,B001FB55I0,"After becoming a blockbuster series in the making with the one-two punch of ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", the burgeoning franchise went on an extended hiatus at the height of its popularity. Then, in 2003, director Jonathan Mostow took over the reins from departing director James Cameron (""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") with ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" which delivered to us the opening salvo of the escalating war with the machines. Now, here we are six years later with yet another new director as the much maligned (at least by me) filmmaker McG throws us headlong into the conflict with the surprising, yet extremely entertaining and satisfying follow-up ""Terminator: Salvation"".

""Terminator: Salvation"" begins in the year 2018, the machines have almost completely taken over the entire planet, and only small pockets of human resistance remain intact. Led by an almost messianic soldier named John Connor (Christian Bale), the humans begin to rally together for a pivotal battle that could bring the devastating war to a swift conclusion. However, a recent addition to the rabble, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), presents Connor and the rest of the resistance with a mystery that could either spell certain doom for humanity or be the secret weapon they so desperately need.

Truth be told, I wasn't sure how good this movie would be prior to its release. The reason for my uncertainty towards this installment had nothing to do with the previous film in the series being somewhat weaker, and everything to do with this movie's director, McG.

To me McG is nothing more than a hack director with only one good movie to his name. His first two films had been the insipidly crafted and overblown ""Charlie's Angels"" movies. Granted he did follow those up three years later with the amazingly sound, heartfelt and moving football drama ""We Are Marshall"". But when it comes to his more action oriented movies, I think one would be hard-pressed to find an original idea in his head. A fact which the director almost seems proud of as he has referred to his blatant copying as paying an homage rather than ripping off other directors and their movies.

However, as I alluded to earlier, ""Terminator: Salvation"" proved my mistrust of McG's directorial prowess to be somewhat misplaced. Unlike his previous action work where overblown action scenes featuring extremely exaggerated stunt and wire work became very annoying , this film is a grittier, hard-hitting, and dare I say, more realistic style of filmmaking (which may be hard to believe given that this is a sci-fi movie). Also, there are no ridiculously long drawn out slow-motion shots lingering on any of the female characters flipping their hair all around for no good reason ( la the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies).

Now, this isn't to say that McG resisted his apparently insatiable temptation to steal ideas from other movies. In fact, there are numerous instances sprinkled throughout this film where it is quite obvious what movie he chose to base a large majority of his action sequences upon. If you've seen the movie or even just some of the previews, then you should know exactly to what film I am referring.

Numerous times over the course of the movie, several scenes involving the Terminators, or portions of them, blatantly ripped off camera angles or just the style of shooting from Michael Bay's ""Transformers"". These moments don't detract from the movie too much, because I know that by now almost every new thing a director can come up with has been done in some form or fashion; thus, complete originality is difficult to come by. That being said, I just wish that some of the inspiration hadn't been so painfully obvious even to the most casual of viewers. Here's a thought, maybe next time McG should try not to rip off a movie that has a sequel in theaters only a month or so after his movie. Due to the closeness of the release dates, McG's copying looks less like an homage and more like somebody trying to cheat off of someone else's work to get better results.

Despite borrowing visual effects ideas from ""Transformers"", that doesn't mean the effects in ""Terminator: Salvation"" were anything to sneeze at. The work done by the creative minds at Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) was superbly crafted and not surprisingly, the best the series had seen thus far. The inclusion of multiple new Terminator vehicles, models, and so on was very exciting, especially from the standpoint of not only a fan of the series, but a fan of visual effects. If you have ever spent time watching the first three ""Terminator"" movies and wished that you could see more of the vehicles shown in the segments chronicling the future war or see even more Terminators in action, then this movie is definitely the one to see as it delivers on both counts.

In regards to the cast of this film, we find an all-new assemblage of talent making their debut within the series. Leading the new grouping is the intense character actor Christian Bale (""The Dark Knight"") as the leader of the human resistance, John Connor. Not surprisingly, Christian hands in a solid performance, giving us a John Connor that is tough as nails on the outside; however, behind closed doors he still struggles with doubt and despair. These quieter moments with Connor are vital to the character by showing us more than a one-dimensional caricature of a hero, and also to illustrate that he hasn't become cold and calculating like the machines he fights. Not to mention, these reflective scenes also serve as a connection to the decidedly more insecure variation of the character from the previous installment (as portrayed by Nick Stahl). Thankfully though, most of the whining and ""Woe is me"" attitude that permeated Nick's performance is nowhere to be found in this film.

In the primary supporting role, which one could argue is also a lead role in truth, is up-and-coming actor Sam Worthington. As a rising star Sam is in surprisingly high demand with roles not only in this film, but also in James Cameron's ""Avatar"" and the upcoming remake, ""Clash of the Titans"". Based on what I've seen of Sam's acting prowess (which is based solely on this movie as I haven't seen ""Avatar"" yet), I would say as far as an action star goes, he should do very well. He's mastered the steely gaze of previous action heroes such as, Sylvester Stallone or even Arnold; he appears comfortable in action sequences (some newcomers can appear unconfident in their early work); and lastly, he has a presence on screen that captures the audience's attention. As far as his dramatic skills, well that remains to be seen, but at least he should have a decent enough future in the action genre if nothing else.

Rounding out the remainder of the supporting players are Bryce Dallas Howard (""Spider-Man 3""), Anton Yelchin (""Star Trek""), and Moon Bloodgood (""Pathfinder""). Bryce Dallas Howard is given very little to do in her role as John's wife Kate. She is relegated to merely reacting to John's struggles with his doubts or being the strong supportive wife in front of the troops. Moon Bloodgood as Blair, one of John's faithful soldiers, is given more to do than Bryce; however, even then she spends most of her time in action sequences. So, no real depth is given to her character other than that she is an extremely competent fighter.

When you look at the characters of Kate and Blair one definitely gets the sense that the writers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris (""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"") were simply giving a taste of these ancillary characters and that more time would be spent exploring them in future sequels. So with that thought in mind, I say here's hoping for more on these potentially interesting characters in the future.

Lastly, actor Anton Yelchin gets the second most fleshed out supporting role behind Sam Worthington as a young resistance fighter named Kyle Reese. Anton brings an earnest quality to Kyle that harkens back to Michael Biehn's portrayal of an older version of the character in the original film. At the same time, Anton displays a youthful enthusiasm to prove one's self worth in a world of humanity comprised almost entirely of soldiers. Throughout this movie I noticed numerous subtle references to either character traits/mannerisms or phrases that Kyle would say that were reminiscent of the previous movies as well (the same can also be said for John Connor too). It's these little nods and insider references to characters and/or events from throughout the series' history that makes the experience all the more enjoyable for me as I try to catch each one.

All in all, despite the fact that I entered this movie with numerous doubts regarding just how good it could be; I must say that the end result is an incredibly fun, fast-paced, action-packed ride that will leave you wanting more. This installment definitely overcomes the weaker points of the previous film (which was still a good movie in itself) and propels this series forward to deliver even more excitement in the future.

3577869,3,B001FB55I0,"Terminator is like one of those franchises where if there's enough rumors and speculation about a potential sequel in the future, you can bet some screenwriter or producer is like ""hey yeah! we can make a new..."" and find someone with the interest in doing it. I mean Terminator 1 and 2 are considered, T2 especially, to be classics so any director would most likely snap at the chance in doing another installment even if the fanbase or the story doesn't need it and so we have Terminator Salvation, a film directed by McG who's predominantly known for directing Charlie's Angels on the big screen. So how's the film? It's strangely not...bad? Well I shouldn't say that as there's clear problems with the film right from the get-go whether it's script-related or just the direction in the film,there's so many off elements that it feels like the good stuff has to battle it out with the bad stuff just to save face. It's not an utter travesty like many claimed but the movie just does so much wrong that it's like doing a guitar solo and for every awesome moment, there's just dead notes.

The year is 2018 (a year shown in red against a black background which made it strangely hard to read for me) and Judgement Day has happened leaving mankind to fight to survive not only in terms of supplies and shelter but in their war against the machines developed by Skynet. Found wandering the wasteland is Marcus Wright, a former death row inmate now walking a world he's unfamiliar with and with company he's just met, namely Kyle Reese and small mute girl Star. Also in the former world fighting the machines is John Connor, who some believe to be the savior for humanity while others believe he's just nutty (though we strangely don't get that side of the conflict in the movie much). Marcus and John will eventually meet and form an unlikely partnership as they try to take down Skynet.

My problems with the story strangely can be best evidenced in the ""Maximum Movie Mode"", the innovative commentary/picture-in-picture/analysis of the film you might've seen in the ""Watchmen"" release. Near the end of the film, McG shows us 2 deleted scenes: the first being one uninterrupted take of John Connor delivering a speech prior to the infiltration on Skynet and urging them not to attack. It's a more personal and indeed more upfront Connor and almost humanizes him more, especially when he brings up his mother Sarah, a woman thought crazy now proven to have been right all along and director just took it out. Then there's the 2nd: Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, reaches into his pocket and takes out a photo of Sarah Connor, the familiar one we all know from the end of the first film. This could've had huge symbolic weight to it. Imagine it: you literally hold your future in your hand, that being a woman you fall for, a woman you conceive a child with and a woman you die for protecting her and all this for somebody what...late teens, early 20's? Yet it's taken out. Then there's nods to the old films like the line ""I'll be back"", which previously brought with it impending doom (first one) or a welcome rescue hero moment (second movie)...here? It's just any old line of dialogue. They even bring back Guns N Roses ""You Could Be Mine"" for no other reason than to go ""hey remember this from T2?"" Then there's weird plot elements that are either missing (what happened to owning dogs to warn them of approaching terminators? Or was that later? Or how a gigantic-ass Transformer-sized robot can creep up on a shack in the middle of nowhere. What, was he on his tiptoes?

So obviously you can see I don't like the story but how's the action you ask? Quite good actually...for the first bit. Metal Gear stealth robot moment aside, that whole section which culminates in a high-speed car chase on the highway is awesome and the digital effects are better than ever and with an eye that's noticed bad and good CGI over the years since Jurassic Park, this is some fine CGI,though the surprise cameo at the end is incredibly dodgy. But the film kind of loses steam after a character is imprisoned and 2 others captured and even then the action almost feels ordinary. Acting-wise it's...fine with Christian Bale still doing that ""smokes 10 packs a day"" voice he used for Batman or he just simply whispers while Bryce Dallas Howard is barely given anything to do, ditto for Common who we see has an arc involving a dead brother but that just disappears. One pulling the weight is Sam Worthington, now seemingly the hottest thing in sci-fi thanks to this, ""Avatar"" and forthcoming ""Clash of the Titans"" whose accent occasionally wavers but delivers on a good character arc. And boy-in-a-man's-world Anton Yelchin does a serviceable job as Kyle Reese though was oddly better as Chekov in ""Star Trek"".

Ever since commentaries entered the DVD special features, many directors utilized this bonus to comment on the filmmaking process, scene inspiration or working with a certain actor. Now with Bluray, studios are enhancing it a bit further with what's called ""Maximum Movie Mode"", a sort of commentary hybrid that mixes picture-in-picture showcasing the filming of a certain scene compared to the final image, storyboards and concept art, interviews by the cast and crew and more prominently, a presentation done by the director that points out certain elements on screen or dissects a certain element. While it's certainly innovative and handy, it can also lead to some parts being missed entirely such as the scene where Marcus discovers the truth about himself (the part spoiled in the trailers) and instead of commenting on the concept behind the scene and the discussion it creates, McG talks about the different acting styles of the 2 and just wants the ""camera to do the talking"". The rest of the special features are functional though they're hardly on the same level of detail as Star Trek's bonus features was. As far as the director's cut is concerned, like another reviewer pointed out, there's some small omissions and some little moments taken out but it isn't a radical re-design of the film so don't expect the same kind of shift that tends to accompany a director's cut.

Is Terminator Salvation worth a purchase? Yes and no though I'm sure people will lean towards a no. It has nothing as far as the humanity elements from T2 yet it's way better than Terminator 3 so this is either hopefully a stumbling block in this ""reboot"" if you will or we're going to suffer 2 more average-but-could-be-better entries.

Anton Yelchin was really good as teenage Kyle Reese. This was a genuine portrayal of the future war against machines. The picture is okay for what picture the format can produce. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that this dvd version does not include the ""Director's Cut"" version of the movie. I would also like to point out that the dvd has absolutely no extras. The Blu-ray version of the movie not only includes the ""Director's cut"" but other extras that talk about how they did stunts and effects for the movie. The ""Director's Cut"" version of the movie is 3 minutes longer and includes a nude scene in the rain of Moon Bloodgood, more blood in the scene where men attempt to rape her, and a tension building scene between Christian Bale and Michael Ironside in which ""General Ashdown"" puts a gun to John Connor's head. I prefered the ""Director's Cut"" version of the movie because it lent more to the story emotionally and visually. Also to those who think there is no difference between ""Blu-ray"" and ""Dvd"" you need to get some glasses morons. It offers 6x the resolution that ""Dvd"" produces, and you get a much more crisper detailed picture.

Anyway, to address the issue at hand, I happen to think that Terminator is the greatest movie franchise of all time (sorry Star Wars nerds). James Cameron did a great job on T1 and T2 and Salvation was a fantastic addition to his masterpiece (lets not mention T3). The only things missing from Salvation are the constant chase vs escape feelings and the confusion over how events fit in the puzzle of time. There are also a lot more depictions of other humans involved in the war, John Connor is not a hero yet. True fans of Terminator will notice several references to the previous editions, which I found to be funny. Note: I might be a little biased because Christian Bale is my favorite actor. Sam Worthington was pretty good too. Ok, so that's my review. I bought this movie and I still watch the other 2 on Netflix periodically.",1262736000,,941,4.57396449704142
3577918,4,B001FB55I0,"BACKGROUND
Back in the 80s I wasn't a fan of the first Terminator movie and actually I wasn't fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies at all. Years later I gave a chance to T2 and I was blown away. I thought that the movie was awesome and that they rescued the story. But then years later T3 came out and I was very disappointed. Now with Terminator Salvation I have mixed feelings. The movie and plot is essentially good and entertaining, but now I'm convinced that T2 was ""an anomaly that went strangely great"".

PLOT
Ok, this is a summer action packed movie, if you are looking for that, you will get it. Explosions, killer robots, lots of action, etc. As long as I remember T3, this is a very different story. On this movie, the world is at war against the machines (kind of the war described in the Matrix trilogy, so if you ever imagined a prequel to Matrix, this could have been the script).

As any other sci-fi movie that needs to show that humans are losing the war, is set in desert locations. This adds certain texture to images and overall aspect of the film. Just to give you an idea of the looks of this movie, the first thing that comes to my mind is Mad Max, the latest is Resident Evil: Extinction (and a lot of other movies in between).

PERSONAL COMMENT
I have never been a hardcore fan of Terminator series, but I found this movie really entertaining and enjoyable. Hardcore fans will always complain about anything, but if you just want to sit back and relax 2 hours, this is for you.

CAST
Christian Bale is playing John Connor while Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a cameo appearance. Sam Worthington is introduced as a new character that links humans with machines. I thing that is all you need to know. The performances are solid for a sci-fi action film.

MUSIC
Again the T2 drums appear. They still sound great. Generally speaking the score is good.

CONCLUSION
This is good movie within its genre, intended for action/sci-fi followers. It's not definitive in the series but it's definitively better than T3. You will end enjoying it if you just sit back and relax.",1262649600,,2085,4.531914893617022
3577919,2,B001FB55I0,"This movie is all action, no talk! Well, some talk, but the action is so intense that the story and variety of scenes in this movie suffers greatly. Sam Worthington plays a character--Marcus--that seems to come out of nowhere. There was no mention of him in any of the three previous Terminator movies, and this movie seems to be mostly about him, even centered around him more than John Conner. And him getting hooked up with some hot babe in the desert was really CORNY and soap opera-ish. He's a machine, for crying out loud!

I was hoping that this movie would center around the start of the relationship between Kyle Reese and John Conner (father and son, you know), not this Markus dude. He played a noble character, but I thought it was an unnecessary addition to the grand Terminator tale. Hopefully the next sequel will hone in on Reese and Conner more.

As with a lot of action movies these days, this flick didn't have a lot of charm and variety to it. This is not entirely the fault of the screenwriters, of course, since the setting is, after all, post-Armageddon with everyone living like savages in constant misery and fear--not a lot of room for comic relief and witty one-liners as in Terminator 2. And of course, having no Ahnold (aside from a brief appearance of a Terminator of his likeness) just isn't the same! And Linda Hamilton is sorely missed as well! So obviously this flick isn't going to be as all-around entertaining as Terminator 2.

I thought all the scenes of the Resistance fighting the machines looked straight out of an Xbox or PS3 game, exuding that same vibe you feel when playing a video game. And that's fine for teenage boys, I'm sure, but I'd rather the movie seem more like a regular movie, overall.

So for hardcore Terminator movie fans, I wouldn't recommend against adding this movie to your collection, but I wouldn't call it a must-have, either.",1262476800,2,1893,4.641791044776119

I only managed to watch the directors cut and often the scenes/editing comes off as dull. Bale lacks any form of Charisma and Worthington is actually not required. Moon Bloodgood/Bryce Dallas Howard are wasted here. T3 may have had it's faults but it was far more entertaining than this, and the leads actually had better things to do.

3577952,1,B001FB55I0,"Let me start off by saying that I rarely write negative reviews on Amazon.  Although I don't write that many reviews here, I prefer to spend my time writing reviews about items, movies and music that I really like that I think will be helpful to others.

That being said, this movie is so awful, I felt compelled to write about it here.  I'm a HUGE fan of the first two Terminator movies.  They both certainly rank in my top movies of all time, so I was really excited to see this latest installment.  Oh man, I really couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Extremely thin storyline, no new twist, horrendous amateur acting, woeful script and a complete lack of directing skill.  Basically, they took the storyline which we all know and tried to create special effects around it and use a lot of the lines from the previous films as comedic gestures.  Incredible mistake.  Using phrases like ""I'll be back"" and ""Come with me if you want to live"", completely out of context, was excruciating and embarrasing to watch. No imagination whatsoever on the directing or writing.

Although they had some really good actors in the film, the lack of a proficient director and a decent script gave them very little to work with and their performances ended up being very soap-opera'ish.  How Christian Bale got caught up in this mess is beyond me.  Although, I'm sure he got a decent paycheck for it.

I hope the next installment is put in the hands of a proper director who can infuse vision, uniqueness, direction and storyline into the project. In my opinion, give this one a miss.  It will only disappoint.",1262304000,8,1597,4.617021276595745
3577953,5,B001FB55I0,"I've seen this Blu-ray twice, Director's Cut once. The extra three minutes isn't much, but it does add a bit of smoothness to the story. If an extended version ever comes out (late 2010?) I'll be there to get my copy. I also read most of the complaints about this movie in between my two viewings. It didn't make any difference. Thankfully this movie doesn't remind me of T2 that much. Instead I think of Blade Runner and the recent TV series Battlestar Galactica. These are all treatments of similar ideas (replicant androids, and/or dominant robots) which I really enjoy.

I'm happy with the story, the casting, the acting ability of the cast, and the state-of-the-art production quality; AND the design and visual concepts, special effects, music, etc., etc. Considering the 118 minute running time, I don't see where a minute was wasted in telling the tale. Some of the complaints I've been reading here are about what more explanation the story needs. The-Powers-That-Be have cut it to its current length. We'll have to wait for a longer version.

I don't get all the complaining! One person says there are too many characters and the scope is too large; but T4 is a world war. Other people refer to the original films as being better somehow, and I heartily DISAGREE. I confess! I've never liked Arnold's Austrian-accented ""witticisms"", and I also did not enjoy him as a ""good guy"" in T2. T1 was better, but that was a long time ago. Now that everybody has been schooled on the foundations of the Terminator saga, it's time to step up to the next level of the story. T4's director, McG, did just that, and very well, IMO.",1262304000,,1627,4.685314685314685

I thought T2 had great special effects (and a knockout performance by Linda Hamilton) and T3 was an amusing send-up but they both lacked the freshness of the original. Thankfully Terminator Salvation takes the series in a completely different direction while still keeping in theme with the first movie.

What really makes T4 a thrill for me is that the actors make the most of their somewhat typical screenplay. Christian Bale is good as usual but Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood and Anton Yelchin rise above their flatter dialogue and give us characters you want to root for.

The special effects in this film are also great, but unfortunatly loose alot of their impact on DVD. The transfer tears a bit and like most things on the small screen it's easier to pickout where the green-screen begins and the real actors end (some of the cooler stunts look laughable on DVD).

So like I said, if you liked the movie Terminator Salvation is still a must buy. It you are bothered by an unperfect copy then best to test out the Blu-Ray.",1262131200,3,1102,4.641025641025641

Lots of story and action going on here, kept me interested in it from start to finish. Christian Bale has become the go-to actor for franchise films, and this one continues in the tradition of the original, with lots more. And even better, the ending was much better than I would have expected, certainly, with the direction it seemed to be going after it was revealed that one of the heroes of the movie was a Terminator, they worked it out into a satisfying, if poignant, ending.

3578010,5,B001FB55I0,"Back in 2003 as I was driving with my Mom from seeing Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and we starting with ideas about a possible 4th film. We mentioned it taking place in the future where Humanity was actually at war. That there would be no more Terminators going back in time to help John Conner since the end of T3 showed the beginning of Judgment Day at the end. Low and behold the makers of Terminator Salvation decided to do just that. Taking place in 2018 the film shows an end of world scenario kind of like 28 Days Later, where most of Humanity is dead, or underground fighting and hiding from the Machines. It points to a bleak world where Skynet has enslaved some of the Human Race. Terminator Salvation was a much better improvement than T3: Rise of the Machines. Not that T3 was alwful, but it could have been more darker, less humorous. This film was dark and lined up with T1 and T2 in James Cameron style. I was very surprised by the cameo appearance of you know who if you watch this film. I was surprised not to see the T-1000 or T-X models but I don't know if they have been invented yet in this period of the future, although Skynet mentions ""they've sent their best Terminators in time to defeat John Conner and all have failed"". This film stayed in storyline with the first 3 films, and has a great cast along with Sam Worthington that kept audiences guessing. You can have a good Terminator film without Arnold or Linda Hamilton. It was great though she lent her voice though and Christiane Bale did a great John Conner.

3578013,3,B001FB55I0,"I'm a big Terminator fan. It's one of my most favorite movies of all time. I love T1 and T2. T3 was made for the fans and I loved that too just because it got Arnold back in his old role. When I heard another Terminator movie was going to come out I figured it was either going to be mind blower, or really poorly done. Terminator salvation is somewhere in between those two. It's a mind blower because they adapted a lot of new concepts into the Terminator story arc, but it's poorly done because it doesn't follow the originals too well.

 T-Salvation is a ""Super"" Holly Woodized version of T1 & T2. With all the special effects added in, it kind of took away from the realism of Terminator and made it seem a bit too ""Sci-Fi"" or just unbelievable. It lacked the element of realism that made T1 & T2 so fantastic. Watching Terminator Salvation made me flashback to watching ""War Of The Worlds"" or ""Transformers"" with it's heavy CGI use. It's just action scene after action seen with a shallow story in between.

 Aside from the usual focus on John Conner this one mainly centered around Kyle Reese and an unknown Terminator Marcus Wright. I enjoyed the Unknown Terminator more than anyone else in this film. He was the only one that had a ""personality"" and ""story"" to add to the film.

 The weirdest thing about it all is that it seemed to take John forever to trust and accept the Unknown Terminator as an ally...I only guess he forgot about the last to films T2 and T3 where a Terminator only SAVED HIS LIFE! about a dozen times. I mean common what is this garbage! Did the writers not ever see any of the other films? In this movie John hates Terminators more than they hate themselves. You think after all these years he would realize that the Terminators can be programmed to protect people instead of just killing them... or did he forget what he learned from Arnold?

 The bottom line is that what  makes this movie such a disappointment is its lack of a developed story, and knowing the series they could have done so much better. It's the future and John is the leader of a ""resistance group"" and people follow him on command. I must have fell asleep between T3 and Terminator Salvations because I think there's a movie missing. You know the one they made that explains HOW John became the military leader people would follow? How these massive armies came together to fight the machines, and how the machines organized and developed themselves to be such a powerful and dominating force. Terminator Salvation skips all of that and jumps right into the future. The biggest problem there is that the Machines are more advanced than the ones than we encountered in the first 2 movies that were supposed to be from a much more distant future than the one presented in T-Salvation. That's where the story becomes confusing for the audience. It's more futuristic and developed than the T1 and T3 future, but its set further back in the time than those dates.

 When you watch Terminator Unknown throughout the movie, you realize that he is out of place, because he more humanistic than the other terminators. This is something that the T-800, and T-1000 who were created at much later dates could not achieve. Apparently Skynet was able to make a highly advanced Terminator that modeled humans perfectly, so much so that it had no problems reaching either of their primary targets ""Kyle Reese"" and ""John Connor"" that they spent the first 1-3 movies trying to kill. Even though those terminators where made at a date much later than Terminator Unknown...? That just doesn't make any sense. All it shows me is that the creators of this movie are not followers of the Terminator series. T-Salvation is completely out of place and is pretty much the ""Batman & Robin""of the series (yeah the one with George Clooney).

 Watching this film you'll appreciate the action sequences, but if your looking for those nostalgic moments that made T-1 and T-2 famous it's not here at all. Pick it up because you want to see a Terminator action film, but don't take it to heart as it has many flaws. For this reviewer the Glass was half empty. Decent film, just not as developed as it should have been and there's no excuse for that. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.",1261958400,,4268,4.570680628272251

The rest of the movie though basically sucks, as did T3.  The rest of the cast sucks, even B.D. Howard, and they give a third rate performance.  And the plot?  Don't get me started.  Where is the continuity here?  Fox's ""The Sarah Connors Chronicles"" keeps continuity more in line, stemming from T2.  T3 sucked so bad that it doesn't even count.

In fact, I'd hazard to guess the Maginot Line was at least a passive failure while Terminator 3 fell more along the lines of ""Is there any possible way I can remove my rectum through my mouth?"" type of epic failure.

Thankfully, Terminator Salvation rectifies this.  While not as action packed as its three predecessors, we are finally introduced to John Connor, whose very existence has been the crux of the Terminator dogma.  Exploring the initial structure of the human resistance, and its looming possibility of schism, truly gave one a sense of the scattered and desolate nature of humanity.  It also showcases a stage in the ever-changing evolution of Skynet and its slow, rumbling path towards human extinction.  Skynet isn't everywhere yet and the resistance, while holding out, still lacks the momentum, and personnel, to truly strike any critical blows against its AI antagonist.  This sets up a very well-written story and poses the question ""What truly makes us human?""

I was having a pretty good time with this movie.  The special effects were solid, the storyline fairly cohesive and Sam Worthington's performance was strong.  I fully expected Marcus to not survive the movie, but when they arrived back at the rebel camp I had was pleasantly surprised he survived the fight at Skynet.  Then the massive, huge let down with him volunteering his heart to save John Connor.  The really irritating part is John nodding to him like ""Good show old chap, I'll make good use of it"".  Marcus had every bit as much right to ""life"" as it were and was the most compelling character in the film (much more so than Connor/Bale).  He would have made an excellent torch bearer to carry on the fight and could have breathed new life into the series.  As it is we get a stupid ending with Bale set for another sequel.

For those saying it would ruin any congruity between Salvation and previous films, Connor already stated his mother's recordings make no mention of such a ""terminator"" - it could be explained as the time line unexpectedly shifting (just as it would have if Kyle had been killed).

John Connor should have died, Marcus should have lived.  The last minute re-write (from what I heard) spoiled this film for me.",1261872000,2,1253,4.624434389140271

3578122,3,B001FB55I0,"I really wanted to like TERMINATOR SALVATION.  In fact, after the first few scenes, I thought I would.
But fate was not going to be kind to me on that count.

First, what went right (there will be spoilers):

[a] Future War - you get to see what it is like for the survivors of J-Day to actually fight the machines.
[b] Opening sequence - from Marcus getting the needle to the attack on the R&D facility, the image quality, action, characters and plot actually started to work for me.
[c] Warthogs - any movie that includes the A-10 is worth watching.
[d] Skynet Central - it looked both technologically advanced, as well as kind of primitive.
[e] Human Prisoners - the reaction of John Connor to the prisoner issue was believable and worked as a motive for insubordination.

Now, for what went wrong:
[f] The War Against the Machines - viewers did not get to see many details about this all-encompassing conflict.  Did you see any soldiers' banter during down time?  Burials? Chaplains? Did you see any of their supply chain? I mean humanity was nearly wiped out.  Where do they get their food, fuel, ammunition, spare parts and communication gear?  I mean, the amount of screen time needed to clarify this is minimal; a couple of conversations between characters about such things could make all the difference between plausible and hard-to-swallow.
[g] Arnold - did we really need to see CGI Arnold?  I mean, the story has to stand on its own, and inserting him was a waste of time and effort.  He could have been in a background shot of the management of Skynet before J-Day and that would have worked; but he did not need to be in the movie.
[h] Marcus - he should have been driven to the brink of insanity by all that happened.  He was on DEATH ROW one minute, and then in the middle of what looks like a cross between Antietam and the Tet Offensive.  I'd be nearly bonkers.  Wouldn't you?
[i] Marcus' plug-in - When Marcus connected to Skynet and learned all about J-Day, why didn't he react more visibly than he did?  Why did Skynet take the personae of Connor, Reese and Dr. Serena Kogan, when it could have taunted him w/ the memories of his dead brother?
[j] Skynet is Omniscient, 1 - how in the world could Skynet have known that Kyle Reese should be targeted for elimination?  It seemed like a distraction to me, making ONE KID the focus of their efforts.
[k] Skynet is Omniscient, 2 - why did Skynet develop an obsession with John Connor so early?  It would be like making the focus of World War One not to defeat Germany but to take out Corporal Adolf Hitler.  Had the writers any common sense, Skynet would have targeted Connor FOR HIS EXPLOITS ON THE BATTLEFIELD.  A bit of dialog could have covered that easily.

Try this on for size:

General Ashdown: ""You really got their attention hitting their factory two years ago, and the ammo dump last month; now all I see on the intel reports is that they want your head on a stick""
John Connor: ""It's what I was born to do""

[l] The Signal - too easy, and Connor should have known this; if Ashdown had said that his boys put together a VIRUS that MIGHT shut them down, and it needed to be tested, that would have been a bit more believable.
[m] John takes a dive into treacherous waters - Although it worked for me that the Commanders were on a sub, did Connor really have to take a dive into the Perfect Storm?  Did anyone on the production team ever hear of hypothermia?
[n] White Hat Wipeout - In many movies and TV shows, it seems to be a popular notion to kill all of the hero's forces, to reinforce the hopelessness of the situation.  In TS all of the Resistance fighters get waxed (except for Character Shield Connor) NEEDLESSLY.  Had the writers put in a big gun battle that would have been much more enjoyable, and advance the notion that the war is WINNABLE.

Example:

Connor's team gets pinned down by two groups of T-600's, calls in an air strike, and a medevac.  In the middle of it all, the hackers get their data, and fight their way back to beaten-up Huey with Common as a door gunner mowing down any metal that came their way.

After dropping off the wounded @ the infirmary, the hackers then PRESENT their findings to command, with Connor ready to add his two cents about the new machines.

See how simple it is to describe an action sequence and the aftermath?

[o] Marcus meets Connor - who in the world wrote that dialog?  Why even mention Kyle Reese? I found it to be too Deus-Ex-Machina for my taste.  They did not follow the 'show don't tell' rule of film making.
[p] Climactic battle - only ONE T-800 was available for action?  I mean this is SKYNET; they have countless machines available for use.  Oh, and I didn't know that John Connor's heart and lungs had WOLVERINE'S mutant healing power.  I mean a few gun shots could have more believably imperiled his life, and it would have made Marcus's sacrifice needless.
[q] Heart Transplant - the notion that a heart transplant can be performed IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT is a bit of a stretch for my small, reptilian mind.  But not the geniuses behind their Clark Novas.

All in all it was good, but not up to 'Terminator' or 'T2' standards, but better than 'T3.'  And, don't get me started on Fox's cancellation of the TV show 'Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.'  Arguably one the best Movie-to-TV adaptations EVER but it had ZERO continuity w/ TS.

Now if only James Cameron, or Joss Whedon were to actually obtain the rights, and do something worthwhile with the franchise.  There's still life in it, but it needs to be nurtured.

I hadn't heard anything specific about this movie so when the T-800 came out looking exactly like an early-mid 80's Arnold I was pleasantly shocked because during the marketing of this they made such a point to say that he wasn't going to be in it when I saw him I got goose bumps.

About the most memorable thing for me about this movie was all the growling and yelling by Christian Bale (John Connor).  Seems all he did was scream the whole time.  The twist w/ Marcus Wright and his thread through the film was semi-interesting, but not enough so to save the picture overall.  There were some intense action scenes to thrill the 11 and 12 year old boys that were watching, but beyond that I found this to be a huge letdown.",1261180800,8,636,4.439655172413793

3578170,2,B001FB55I0,"Upon learning that Hollywood is about to flog a dead horse, with the help of two amateur 'schmuck' producers, one could not help but be apprehensive. However, with Christian Bale onboard, things got interesting. Fresh from his stunning success of ""The Dark Knight"", Bale might infuse credibility into an already exhausted franchise that spanned 25 years.

When McG was announced as the director, one could only reflect on how much McG's body of work pales in comparison to that of James Cameron's. Cameron was smart enough not to touch any further Terminator sequels with a ten-foot pole. He has finished telling his story with T2 and decided to leave it at that. Unfortunately, Arnie had to make T3 as his swansong before his foray into governorship in order to boost his flagging popularity.

Now, we come to this: T4, aka Terminator: Salvation. Since this takes place in the future, it's another portrayal of a bleak future. But this is no ""Blade Runner"". McG is no James Cameron or Ridley Scott. Heck, he's not even George Lucas, even in the Star Wars prequel movies. As much as he tries, McG couldn't direct actors. Bale is a fine actor. But not all humans are perfect. All he needs is the right director to point him to the right direction. Christopher Nolan succeeded tremendously in the resurrected Batman movies and the underrated 'The Prestige'. Terence Malick brought out an understated Bale in ""The New World"". Michael Mann had him in Elliot Ness style in ""Public Enemies"".

Christian Bale basically sleepwalked into his role. He works his usual style: being intense. It works with him as Batman as the character is intense. Here, his intensity comes across as being pretentious. His acting here reminds me of 'Harsh Times'. In both movies, he tries too hard to be intense. He looks constipated, sorry to say that. McG is just interested in action and effects. He should fire his editors, one very badly edited scene was the sole nude scene from Moon Bloodgood and the transition to her fighting a few guys. Very badly edited.

If you have nothing good to say about others, then remain silent. I shall do the same for Hollywood current 'IT' boy: Sam Worthington.

Basically, if you are looking at a lame and mundane Sci-fi movie with the high pretensions of an epic, then this movie is for you. There is however one merit to this Blu-Ray edition. The DTS-HD audio will practically bring down your house. I had to tune my amplifier lower. The opening credits alone gives your speakers and subwoofer a mighty workout. The audio is definitely reference quality. Home cinema enthusiasts should check this disc out. Movie buffs should stay far, far away from this.",1261094400,3,2671,4.823144104803493
3578171,1,B001FB55I0,"I was a big fan of the franchise but this really is not part of it. Unlike all the other films, it lacks a story, or even characters you care about. Hard to imagine since it is based on franchise with characters you DO care about. But the truly talentless MTV director McG (and whoever wrote this confusing dark mess of a script) shows his only skill is stringing together a bunch of explosions and fight scenes.
 One of the first problems is the John Conner character and the terminator prototype character look so much alike, it's hard to tell who is who through much of the movie, especially since it is mostly shot in dark, grimy locales. Second big problem -- a complete lack of humor or heart. Totally cardboard characters that its hard to care anything about. Third problem -- the ending sequence is ludicrous. So many holes there it's hard to know where to begin.

It was filled with CGI, most of it fair to bad as well as goofy things that no human could ever survival, like a helocast from a pretty decent altitude at a high rate of speed that John Conner performed and didn't even get wet in the process.  The plot was overcast by almost non-stop action in an apparent attempt to hide it, which is a real shame, as the plot is a noble one.  The ending was unsurprising as well.

In my humble opinion, this didn't hold a candle to the first 2 Terminator movies..it was flat. Completely flat. Like watching a blank TV screen for 2 hours.
It lacked any of the ingredients that made the first 2 superior films. Even the 3rd Terminator film was better than this dribble. The film really just dragged for me and didn't have enough plot or story to hold my interest. This was another 2009 movie that spends a lot for explosions but zero on characterization. The characters were unlikeable & just bland to show any real interest. Who knew John Connor would be a boring/bland character as an adult ?
Sure there are a few moments with the Terminator robots going after the characters (what was Christian Bale thinking??) but it wasn't much. It was a whole lot of nothing going on. Even the naked ""Schwartzenegger"" Terminator running around trying to kill Connor wasn't anything special
Arnold Schwarzenegger may not be that great a governor but at least the Terminator movies he did had substance, a good story and a director who knew what it takes to make a good science fiction futuristic story with characters to root for a care about. If they make another Terminator film it should be directed by James Cameron in other words.
I would only see it if you like the Terminator series & are curious to see this one.

3578175,3,B001FB55I0,"Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do? Well, here's a word of advice: If you're like me and you want to see the Director's Cut (the R version) versus the Theatrical PG-13 version, buy this. Because I first rented it from Netflix, but Netflix is sending out a Blu Ray version that's PG-13. I found this especially odd because I can't find a Blu Ray version for sale that's PG-13. So how and why is it that Netflix's Blu Ray version of Terminator Salvation is PG-13?

Am I sure? Yes, I'm sure. There is no mention of Director's Cut on the Netflix sleeve or the disc itself. The disc did indeed say Blu Ray. And right before the movie starts it says rated PG-13 by the MPAA. But the solid evidence came from watching the Netflix version and finding that there was none of the Director's Cut extra's so perfectly outlined in Senor Zoidbergo's lead customer review on the Amazon front page for this product.

Regardless of whether you get the Director's Cut or have to settle for the Theatrical version, you're in for an average movie viewing experience at best. I was certainly entertained. I love the Terminator movies...especially T1 and T2. I know a lot folks hated T3; I for one did not hate T3. T3 was not up to par with 1 & 2, but it wasn't as awful as all the pile-ons make it sound. No, I think that Terminator Salvation and T3 are equally average...in their own unique ways.

And I'll tell ya, it was hard watching Salvation and not thinking about that tirade that Christian Bale went on during the filming of this movie? Have you heard that? Oh my God, what a chump. Sam Worthington stole this movie from Bale; Worthington's performance in Salvation may even get me to get out to the theater to see Avatar and next year's remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B00005JKO7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>.

But the story in Salvation didn't come close to living up to what Terminator or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2/dp/B001RIY4WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2:</a>&nbsp;delivered. Salvation's story is by far not put together as well as its inspirations, and many of the scenes are just over the top no-way situations. How did teen-pop TV Producer McG land the director's chair for such a coveted franchise as the Terminator series? Maybe he didn't teeny-bop Salvation, but it was very weeknight CW networked up.

Bottom line: Terminator Salvation is a rental, but if you rent it at least be sure that you're getting the Director's Cut. One way to be sure that you get the Director's Cut is to add this now to your Amazon cart. Buy or rent? Buy or rent? What to do...what to do?",1260921600,,3063,5.204868154158215

Disconcertingly, at various moments in the film it's not easy to know if Christian Bale is man or machine; his somewhat wooden style is almost uber-ironic here. But McG continues to deliver the goods, visually, though this one feels somehow hollow, despite excellent effects. T4, while better than T3, never approaches T2. But then again, James Cameron has rather more of a sense of humor than McG.

3578177,3,B001FB55I0,"While lacking the blend of action and humanity that made the first two movies so good, this is a decent film as long as you don't go in with ginormous expectations.

The plot is a little jumbled, the movie takes some time to hit its stride and the acting (especially by the leads) is plastic at times, but there are some good action sequences and enough going on that I was able to power through some wicked tiredness to watch this at 1 a.m. the other day.

I particularly liked Marcus Wright's plotline, which is unfortunately undermined by some subpar acting on Worthington's part. I kind of enjoyed the fact that John Connnor isn't head of the human resistance; after the last two films one expects him to be the honcho. It was cool how John used his computer know-how in a few situation, harking back to T2 when he hacks into the ATM. The Kyle Reece storyline and the actor who plays him are really cool. That could almost have been its own movie.

There was a lot I didn't like, or at least a lot of things I wish the filmmakers had re-considered:

-- The numerous obvious nods to other moves are rife: Marcus emerges screaming and muddy from a subterranean labyrinth (Shawshank Redemption). John Connor's radio broadcast's to the at-large resistance fighters (Apocalypse Now). The final scene when John is rigging the nuclear power cells is both a cop of the end of Aliens and the first Terminator movie. A machine collects humans and holds them for transport (a theme from War of the Worlds that also looks very much like Spielberg's from a few years ago).

-- Marcus emerges into a world he doesn't know, and yet he seems completely at ease. No freak-out over the destruction of humanity? No concern over robots hunting humans with giant machine guns?

-- There are A-10 Warthog planes pulling maneuvers no A-10 Warthog could ever accomplish.

-- The machines and the humans are in an all-out war. The machines are actively hunting the humans and yet on several occasions the resistance is seen staging raids out of giant army bases and airplane hangers full of equipment. Wouldn't that be a bit of a tell for the machines?

-- It seems awfully easy for John to infiltrate the Skynet headquarters and do as he pleases. What, no perimeter guards as there would be at any central command base?

There are a few other qualms I can't think of right now, including more nods to more movies and things the characters do that I personally would not be doing if I was being hunted by bloodthirsty robots.

Fist, there was no humor AT ALL in this film witch was unlike the other T movies and I think it really needed it to cut the tension a bit and that is something I liked about the other T movies, especially T2.
The second problem I had was with the end. There was a heart transplant that seemed to come out of nowhere and was so dumb and unrealistic. It also took away one of the main characters that I would have liked to see in the next film.
I liked Christian Bail as John but I think Sam Worthington would have made a better John (he played the role of Marcus). The two should have swapped roles.",1260576000,,841,4.197530864197531

Didn't like the John Connor character at all.  Nothing special.  But Marcus Wright - the machine/man - he was incredible.  He was the real star of the film.  Like seriously he was.  It felt like it couldn't possibly be any other way than that he was the star.  And he was incredible - just a truly wonderful character.  The movie was ok, but the character of Marcus Wright was one of the best characters ever.

also instead of making things flow smoothly continuity-wise ,they just take bits and pieces from the original and its sequel and threw them in here. you'll catch them if you're a fan.. cringe worthy stuff.

I thought I was FINALLY going to see John running in the dark fighting TONS of Terminators, like those flashbacks have shown us,but NO. There were maybe like 10 Terminator bots in the whole movie. and not even at the same time.

Don't even get me started on that new Terminator kid. How did he survive a NUKE blast? he came out of that whole in mint condition. that whole heart exchange thing..... RIDICULOUS !!! haha. why was that female pilot so dumb?
she swore to fight Terminators but she fell in love with this one in 5 minutes.
how can they give Bale such little screen time??? they never heard of Dark Knight?

and the computer graphics?? SO SOOOO BAD.

I'm so glad the movie rights are going to be sold off. hopefully another studio will wait for the right director and script. its a known fact the producers of this movie just wanted to make a quick cash with a cheesy movie. and it shows.
this movie has no soul.

3578227,5,B001FB55I0,"This will probably turn out to be the strangest 5 star review you've ever read so bear with me. I will start out by saying I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish! I had really high expectations from the moment the initial trailer was released and I'm happy to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least. This is an action movie of the highest order! The CGI was outstanding! I have to take issue with those reviewers who claimed the CGI was not realistic. I have to disagree. I would say this is one of the more realistic CGI movies I've ever seen! The entire movie had a gritty, organic feel to it that was at once bleak and beautiful. Those of you looking for a slam bang good time filled with explosion after explosion you will be very happy.

However - and this is a BIG however - those of you looking for a movie with any kind of depth, emotion, or character development will be sorely disappointed! This ain't T2 people! The thing that made Terminator 2, and to a certain extent the original Terminator, so compelling was the depth of emotion James Cameron (absolute genius that he is) brought to his characters. The idea behind T2 was that if a machine, built for the sole purpose of death and destruction, can develop human feelings of empathy and compassion, then perhaps there is hope for all of us. The initial reviews of Terminator Salvation hinted at a similar theme: what does it mean to be human in a world where most vestiges of humanity have been wiped from the face of the earth? It is a terrific concept; unfortunately the opportunity is completely wasted. Marcus Wright (played by Sam Worthington who is a beast of an actor) is a very intriguing character, but he is never allowed to develop much of an arc. In the end he just feels like someone else put into the movie to shoot guns when he could have been so much more. Christian Bale brings the same dour, one note quality to John Conner that he brings to Batman. That raspy grumble of a voice works for The Dark Knight but here it's just off-putting. He is the bad-ass you'd expect John Conner to be, but for someone who is on the life-changing mission that he is on, he shows zero emotion. The same is true for every other human character in the movie. The machines may not have yet succeeded in wiping out humans physically from the planet, but they have definitely succeeded in wiping out their souls!

I also would have been okay with more time dedicated to the inner-workings of Skynet, or at least a little more history on how Judgment Day actually came to be. Perhaps that will be a topic for yet another sequel, but it could have gone a long way in this movie.

Overall I recommend this movie because it has all the look and feel of a great Terminator movie. Unfortunately it has none of the soul. Again, all you action/ adventure junkies (like me) will be in heaven. Those of you looking for anything more beyond the surface, stick with T2.

And a quick note about the DVD: the fact that there are NO special features included in the standard DVD release is disgraceful! I agree with virtually every other reviewer that this is a greedy move by WHV to force people to buy into their BS blu-ray format. The only thing this move will do is make me stay away from blu-ray that much more!  Nice job Warner!!",1260489600,,3301,4.422697368421052
3578228,4,B001FB55I0,Our only Salvation is Christ.. however if we were all blown to Hell then John Conner may have to do something.. good action sequence and continuous action... at times maybe more than I would have liked but ... hey if its action you want then this movie delivers..,1260403200,,263,4.5
3578259,4,B001FB55I0,"I've been a fan of the Terminator series for as long as there's been a Terminator series and at the conclusion of each of the films there's been a steady theme to my wonderment: When is John Connor going to fulfill his destiny as the savior of humanity?  Unfortunately, my near-famous question remains unanswered once more in Terminator Salvation but before we get into all that, let's explore the nitty-gritty, shall we?

The film represents the fourth full-length motion picture release in the Terminator franchise and the first of which is notably missing T-800 Model 101 portrayal by iconic actor-turned politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger (although there is a segment so well done in his absence that I'm actually going to have to look up how they did it).

For years now we've seen glimpses into the future via brief sequences in each of the films, video games, television series and so on.  It's almost always the same: Black skies behind a global junkyard just littered with human skulls for the advancing robotic exoskeletons to crush with their feet and tank treads.  Humans cower behind rubble while taking potshots at the seemingly invincible mechanized armada before them, armed with brightly flashing lasers and odd hovering aircraft.  It's pretty bleak but then again it's pretty tough to imagine a friendly scenario when describing an event labeled ""Judgment Day"".  Here's the thing- for as long as we've been fed these disturbing post apocalyptic images, we've been given the promise of hope in one man; a man so influential in turning the tide against the machines that they have attempted his assassination (unsuccessfully) across three full movies and two seasons of network television.

Set in the post Judgment Day timeline, Terminator Salvation has been perhaps the closest in potentially allowing the lead character to begin displaying the sheer omnipotence that will eventually be the machines' undoing (save for a few brief seconds at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) but alas, the film makes it clear pretty early on that this is more a Kyle Reese survival tale and an excuse to introduce a new mechanized hybrid (Marcus Wright) then it is John Connor's coming into his own.

The setting is bleak, but not near as bad as the scene we've been teased with all these years (I'm assuming that's because those shots must have represented the moments directly after the robot-induced nuclear war).  It's 2018 in Salvation and the world has been pretty much handed over to the machines.  Small human outposts are scattered about but the ""Resistance"" isn't nearly as well defined here as has been hinted to throughout the franchise.  Rather, both a military and civilian presence coexist amidst the mechanical mayhem.

Connor is as a member of the military effort here (along with his wife Catherine ""Kate"") though his portrayal this time around is closer to that of a low-ranking stereotypical loose cannon than a natural born leader.  In the film's defense, by the end an opportunity for Connor's rapid advancement through the ranks is presented, though there is little along the way that hints to exactly how John Connor's going to inevitably turn the tides once and for all (you'll think it is explained early on, but that thread is a bit of a dead end by the film's conclusion as well).

One of the coolest elements of the film's timeline is that it allows for a nice intimate look at some of the weapons and mechanized beasties that the machines have built in effort to keep us lowly humans in check.  Love or hate the influence computer-generated imaging has had on movie making in recent years, there is little doubt that the sheer scale and complexity of many of the sequences here would not have been possible when the earlier films were dazzling movie-goers.

Among the mentionables are a single-shot helicopter crash sequence that certainly harkens back to some of the finer techniques used in Cloverfield and a robotic sentry that's absolutely terrifying due to it's sheer size and firepower.  I will refrain from gushing over the motorcycle-piloting droids (""Mototerminators"") that dislodge from the large Harvesters to give chase, the slow, methodic machine-gunning of the T-600s, or the very Matrix-esque ""Hydrobots"" that patrol the waterways.  The point is there is far more going on in the land of the machines than simply mindless marching metal skeletons.

And speaking of the Matrix, it would be wrong to skate through this review without at least mentioning the apparent influence the series had on the Terminator's prose.  In all fairness Terminator did it first but while the T-movies were typically set in contemporary time frames with classic horror elements driving a very human emotional chase, this is the first opportunity for the franchise to shift into true science fiction mode.  And I'm pleased to report that it does that well.  Everything from hand-to-hand combat, futuristic weapons, human-mechanical hybrids, to radioactive fallout make their presence felt here.  Couple this to the typical tension-laden ""Terminator"" sound score and you have yourself a heck of fun thrill ride.

Surprisingly, however (especially considering the swing to science fiction), there is really absolutely nothing to do with time travel in this one.  It is mentioned in the dialog and the back story of John Connor attempting to keep young Kyle Reese (his father) safe so that he himself may exist, pays homage to the time-twisting prose of the prior films, but nowhere here is the concept solidified.  So much so is it's avoidance that it leaves viewers wondering such things is how the technology will be discovered, by whom, and so on.

Maybe it's for the best such things were left untouched considering the sheer amount of continuity discrepancies already taking up server space just in arguments stemming from the time travel in the first three movies and the Sarah Connor Chronicle TV series.

Other minor complaints include an impromptu heart transplant (in the most non-sterile environment imaginable) and a John Connor with an absolute disdain for mechanical organisms (despite, as the other movies/ TV shows have led us believe, having practically grown up around those that protected him as well as tried to destroy him).  Small nit picks, sure, but long time fans of the franchise will surely pick up on these things.

In all, and despite what my review may have you thinking, this is an enjoyable film from beginning to end.  If this seems hard to believe considering my abundant criticisms, rest assured that the Terminator pictures have rarely stood up well to scientific scrutiny.  The point is they exist to entertain and Salvation, just like the others, doesn't disappoint in that area.  The action is intense, the pace nice and brisk, and the visuals quite spectacular throughout.  The acting is solid and even the science doesn't require absolute suspension of disbelief (usually a prerequisite in scifi).  At the end of the day it's a fun popcorn flick that manages to make up for its lack of intricate story structure with sheer style.  Just don't go in expecting to finally understand why the robots of the future have made it their number one priority to eliminate John Connor even if they had to invent time travel to do it... It's one of many Terminator discrepancies best left to debate on the fan forums.",1260403200,,7380,5.009819967266775
3578260,3,B001FB55I0,"It's hard to know how to rate these releases at times. Do you base it on the movie alone? The DVD/Blu-Ray release? I'll have to do the movie and dvd seperate in this review because the grades are different.

The Theatrical Cut is a decent movie. It feels like T3 (which might not be so good to some of you) in the way that a lot of story feels cut. Sometimes it feels like a scene or two is missing. The story, what little there is of it, makes for a decent movie, but could be so much better. Something tells me that James Cameron would have done so much more, but that's movies these days, little story, lots of CGI. Though I must confess I liked Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. What made it to the movie story-wise was decent, but again could be a lot better. It feels like all sizzle and no steak. I'd have to give the movie a B-

The DVD release is highly disappointing. No EXTRAS! Nothing. Not a trailer, commentary or anything that I'm used to with buying dvds. Unfortunately, it seems you have to get blu-ray or else be left behind. I love movies too much to settle for bare bones dvds like this. I think it is an awful way to treat customers and thst the industry is shooting themselves in the foot. Standard DVD will die it's natural death like VHS and everything else before. Why force it? Why risk turning fans against you when you force an issue by not releasing the standard extras? I just think they should let standard dvd fade away, but this is not an industry that is fan friendly. How many times do they release dvds like this only to release the special edition or whatever so fans have to double-dip or just lose out. This DVD release gets an F- from me. Lowest possible score. Rent it. Don't buy. Wait for some far off future re-release anniversary, special edition, blu-ray, anything but this. The companies involved should feel ashamed at themselves for ripping fans off.

3578262,2,B001FB55I0,"Well, this week I've watched three recently released action films.  And in my opinion, CGI is just over the top!  Movies just don't look real anymore.  They look just too animated and kind of fake.  I just watched the new Star Trek, G. I. Joe, and this new fourth installment of The Terminator saga.  The action scenes are now more intense, unrealistic, and overwhelming.  There is so much LESS story, human interaction, compassion, and drama, and MORE visual screen consuming effects.  They even had a computer animated Terminator of Arnold Schwarzennegger.  This goes to show that pretty soon, movies won't even need actors anymore.  Computer animators will create new movie stars (heroes and villains).  Technology, again, is removing the human element of upcoming future jobs and physical social interaction.

And, about the argument about Blue-Ray over the standard DVD:  I know that Blue Ray offers a better High Definition picture.  So, if I got myself conditioned to watching Hi Def films, I will then see the reduced quality of all my regular DVD's, and I don't want that to happen.  I'm at a level of tolerance that allows me to enjoy all my regular DVD's.  Blue Ray would just start me on a journey of frustration because I have so many good movies on DVD, and I do not want to buy them again.  Even renting Blue Ray will open the door to hindering my appreciation of my own standard DVD's.  Ignorance is bliss for me.  Blissful, and affordable, because I am done buying movies.  I can put my money towards better things these days.  So, you people just keep buying your favorite movies, over and over again.  It's only money.",1260403200,3,1637,4.754448398576512

Well yeah... That's the type of movie it's meant to be--post-apocalyptic and all. This was the future I've been hungry to see ever since Reese's flash-backs from the 1st movie and I'm glad it wasn't just another excuse to show off some cute smart-mouthed kid actor, etc...

3578264,5,B001FB55I0,"The Terminator Saga has been one of the most recognizable in science-fiction film lore and for good reason. The idea of timeline manipulation and the impending machine rebellion (which we all know is coming, right? :)) have cemented this franchise into the hearts of movie-goers for over two decades. The fourth installment finally allows us to partake in the story that, up until now, we have only glimpsed at, the actual post-apocolyptic battle between man and machines. This movie screams epic from start to finish with some of the most intense action and special effects I have ever seen. The story is awesome and really pays a lot of homage to the previous films (well, not really much to the 3rd movie wich I thought, while the weakest of the four, was still decent and had a great ending). On a semi-personal note, I wish the story had remained a little more focused on Conner and a little less on Marcus. Conner is the main protagonist in the 2nd-4th films and it seemed like Marcus was really the only character they spent extensive time building. You can tell that the writers assumed the viewer already knew John Connor well. The attention seemed split about (55% Connor and 45% Marcus.) This isn't a huge gripe by any means as they still did a great job. Overall this is a fantastic action/sci-fi movie and fine addition to the Terminatore cannon.

3578268,5,B001FB55I0,"I have to give this five stars because I think most of the bad reviews are from one of a few types of people:
1) people who havn't followed the terminator movies
2) people who just don't like sci-fi
3) people who got caught up in the Christian Bale controversy and just want to hate him
4) people who don't like the director and can't get past that
5) people who think that a movie about cyborgs destroying mankind should have a ""funny, light-hearted"" feel to it
6) people who want it to be like the old movies. You know, get chased for two hours by another new version of the Terminator sent back in time to stop john conner. Then you get to ponder how the future will be changed.

First of all Terminator 3 sucked, it was basically a bad remake of T2 even though I still see it as relevant to the series. As for Terminator Salvation, it is about time that the story got around to the future resistance, and it was done beautifully. The story was awesome and left room for other movies. The cinematography was perfect for the mood of the movie, which was appropriately serious and dark. Not overly done when you think about the context of the movie. The special effects were very good, especially when looking back at the old movies you can tell the CG technology has improved. The acting was top-notch, even though Christian Bale didn't seem like the main character he fit the role. Best of all was the detail put into every scene of the movie, you can tell that a lot of effort was put into every aspect.

The only thing is that I wish some characters from the Sarah Conner Chronicles were used, and that the movie would have tied in with the TV show somehow since it ended so abruptly. And I thought they could have used claire danes for john conner's wife in this movie, it would have worked.

I hoped this could expand into a trilogy of the resistance story using the same main actors and director. But it probably won't because of all the bad reviews from people who probably aren't even fans of Terminator.",1260230400,2,2014,4.379679144385027

I like this movie more than the 2nd and 3rd. The 2nd has the James Cameron aura around it that has everyone charmed. And even though the 3rd was filled with action and ""over the top"" machine on machine battles, it comes in 4th. I still wake up from nightmares of a blown in half Terminator crawling after me where ever I am, so the first is 1st on my list.

3578291,2,B001FB55I0,"Sometimes, you wonder when it's time to stop, and let a franchise die.  Or at the least, make sure the story is coherent and fits in well with what's come before.  But most importantly, try to give the story weight.  If we don't care about what's going on, pretty much nothing is going to save the film, and that's the problem with Terminator Salvation.

Taking place in 2018, the film follows the famed John Connor and newcomer Marcus Wright, as both men fight for their lives in the post-judgment day world.  Killer machines roam the skies and the ground.  While the resistance has found a possible way to shut down the machines for good, the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, as the legendary Kyle Reese, John's father, has been found.  The problem is, the machines are after him.  With both John and Skynet after Kyle, both sides must fight for the fate of the future.

When I first saw the movie in theaters, I left feeling that the film was, at best, an average action adventure movie.  After seeing it again on DVD, time has not been kind to ""Salvation"", as the story feels very disjointed and choppy, as if the film was hacked to pieces and then edited back together.  It feels like entire segments of the film are missing, and the second half of the film moves too quickly for us to get emotionally interested.  By the time the end credits rolled around, I just didn't care.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story, or even the action.

This is probably Terminator Salvation's biggest problem...for all the action sequences, for all the nods to the previous films, the story is the weakest yet in the series.  While the idea of saving Kyle Reese to ensure the events of the future/past happen sounds like a great idea, having the film jump back and forth between Marcus and John makes it feel disjointed.  We don't get time to understand the characters in any meaningful way, besides the most basic of reasons.  John wants to save Kyle.  Marcus wants to find out who he is.  Barnes wants to avenge his brother's offscreen death.  Kyle wants to stay alive.  As a result, we have a cast of essentially one dimensional characters that pale in comparison to the cast of the previous three films.  Some, like Star, are completely unnecessary and could have been cut from the script.

Say what you will about Terminator 3 (I personally really enjoyed it), but it had a focused plot that added to the franchise's mythology with the revelation that Judgment day was just postponed, not stopped.  The film had weight to it, making us wonder if the heroes were going to stop Judgement Day once again.  Here, everything is back to the status quo at the end.  There are no long term changes or consequences of the ongoing story.  There's just no emotional weight to what's going on, and coupled with the disjointed pacing and thin characters, the film feels utterly flat.  Considering how all the previous stories have at least contributed much to the ongoing story, ""Salvation""'s story is a disappointment.

With the poor story and characters, we're left with the action sequences, and regrettably, they don't fare much better.  We have the standard chase scenes with cars, assaults on Skynet bases, and fights with killer robots, but most feel like your standard issue summer action scenes.  The nighttime escape scene in the forest, for example, is utterly flat, save for the sequence in the river.  Then there's the giant transformer like robot at the gas station...I thought it was goofy in the theater, and it's only worse in a second viewing.  Why not replace it with a giant Skynet tank instead?  Why not a whole group of T-600's out to capture human prisoners?  This giant just feels out of place here.

Yet, despite it's stumbling, ""Salvation"" does get a few things right.  The overall mood and art design of the film, with it's shades of greys, blacks, and blues, does an excellent job creating a post apocalyptic world, and I did like the idea of showing us what the war between man and machine looked like before the technology of lasers and time travel is created.  Sam Worthington does a good job of conveying the tough, yet confused Marcus, and Anton Yelchin is outstanding as a young Kyle Reese, and is easily the best actor of the film, making you believe that he really is a young version of Michael Biehn.  It's also a nice treat that Linda Hamilton returned to do voice overs for John's famous audio tapes.  The opening action sequence, an assault on a Skynet Base set amongst dozens of giant satellite dishes, is quite exciting.  But the best part of the film easily comes in the third act, with a cameo appearance by a well known character from the previous films...it's only after this character appears that the film finally becomes really interesting.

But in the end, ""Salvation"" is a disappointing entry into the Terminator franchise.  With it's weak story, weak characters, choppy pacing, and below average to average action sequences, there's really not much to recommend it here.  There are a few good action sequences, and a few good performances by the actors, but that's really it.  Terminator fans will probably get the most out of it, but everyone else should stick to the first three films.",1260230400,3,5255,4.695081967213115

First up is ""Reforging The Furture"" which runs 18:59 and shows how the filmmakers reinvented the franchise. Then there are 4 featurettes - ""Digital Destruction"", ""Enlisting The AirForce"", ""An Icon Returns"", ""Stan Winston Shop"". These four total 11:30. So is it worth it to spend the extra cash for just a hand full of extras? I guess, but I would have loved to have more extras including a commentary.",1260144000,,795,4.802919708029197

I felt it was straining for some deep moral/ethical statement, but just struck me as empty, loose and amateurish.

But Conner's and Wright's path are going to cross with a shocking discovery that may the eend mankind for ever and cost Conner his life.
""Terminator Salvation"" is the lastest installment is a Terminator Saga and as good as the second movie. Christian Bale plays John Conner just right as a man who has a great burden is trying to help others survive, when he couldn't stop Judgement Day from happen. Sam Wentworth is also great a man who trying to make-up for past sins. Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't get much screen time as John's Kate, a role she took over from Claire Danes. Moon Bloodgood plays Blair Williams a fighter pilot who begins to have feelings for Wright even after she learns who and what his is. Director McG doess overall great job with the movie giving a the audience lots of action. The DVD itself could have been better.

3578297,3,B001FB55I0,"John Connor could not prevent Judgment Day from happening; he could only delay it. Now the war has arrived, and John (Christian Bale), along with his wife (Bryce Dallas Howard) and any other surviving humans they run across are part of the Resistance, a group fighting for survival against the machines.

Marcus (Sam Worthington) is part man, part machine, a rejuvenated murderer who was put to death before Judgment Day. The machines created him to combat the Resistance, but his human soul makes him loyal to that side of himself. After sneaking into a base, John Connor orders him to be destroyed, but an amorous female (Moon Bloodgood) helps him escape. Marcus barters with John; he will infiltrate Skynet to save Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), John's father.

As a stand-alone movie, Terminator Salvation is a mediocre action movie which follows a formula set up by others of the genre. It has exciting moments, its predictable moments, and boring stretches. However, as a member of the Terminator series, it is incredibly disappointing, and has such a different mood, it stands out like a wrong note.

Somehow the post-apocalyptic world does not seem as scary and desolate as it did in Reese's flashbacks in T1. There is too much daylight in this movie, and the Resistance has too many resources. Furthermore, these actors' renditions of famous lines from the previous films come out cheesy and cheap, like the film makers just threw them in to keep fans happy.

There are also several continuity problems. How does Alice in Chains begin playing in the Jeep after Marcus hot wires it? I find it hard to believe that a CD, let along a car, survived the nuclear explosions, but lets just assume they did. How, then, does Guns and Roses play over the radio when there isn't a radio station around to broadcast it? Also, how did Sarah Connor's tapes survive Judgment Day? I found it annoying too that they've been re-recorded, although audio obviously exists of them from previous films.

I find it rather annoying that the cast changes with each film; maybe the film makers should take a hint when all of their stars refuse to reprise their roles. The characters seem very shallow in comparison to the previous films. We have spent years getting to know them, John Connor particularly, and suddenly he's completely different, a hardened shell of who he used to be. Bale plays the part like he never saw the other movies in the series, which is made all the more obnoxious because he is a celebrated ""Method"" actor. His involvement seems is a gross miscasting. The most fascinating character is Reese, who is a bit of a mystery anyway, but if a sequel is made (and I hope one isn't), let's hope Reese is the focus.",1260057600,,2713,4.776119402985074

I can understand why they wanted to make this film as when the first two were made they either didn't have the money or the FX just weren't up to speed for such a futuristic story. Bale is sort of waste here as this is a sci-fi action film and he really doesn't get to show his chops. That's not to say I don't appreciate an excellent actor to help make the film more convincing. Terminator Salvation is not the best in the series nor the worst, but if you're in the mood for so good sci-fi fun then this might do the trick.

3578339,5,B001FB55I0,"<<< A few continuity errors (spoilers?) follow the Octothorpes >>>

Earlier this year I enjoyed ""Terminator Salvation"" on a big-screen digital theater with a group of sci-fi friends and we all loved it. Then, being a huge fan of the Terminator franchise, I jumped at the chance to buy the 2-disc Blu-ray release. I just finished watching the ""Director's Cut"" and must admit to you all that ""I Forgot How Good This Movie Is"". It is a good sci-fi story, as well as a good sci-fi movie.

But let's be realistic, it was the only sci-fi movie of 2009. ""Transformers 2"" was a fantasy and ""Star Trek (reboot)"" was a futuristic soap opera with one of the poorest sci-fi plots I've ever seen in a movie theater.

 #########################################################

<<< Tiny Continuity Errors >>>

1) in both releases, there is a noticeable annoying gap between the time that John Connor ""exits the rescue plane"" then ""enters the submarine"". This could have been easily fixed.

2) in the Director's Cut, the rain mysteriously stops between the time that John Connor leaves Blair Williams then returns to save her from attack by three men. This could have been easily fixed.

3) one possible plot weakness: all throughout the movie, people (including John Connor) are using two-way radios. You would think that Skynet would have been able to home-in upon these signal sources, and maybe Skynet did. Now if you think of Skynet as a chess-playing gaming system (TSCC fans know what I am talking about here), then even the voice of John Connor on the radio may not have been as valuable to Skynet as the destruction of the submarine which represented the top of the Resistance's command-control system. (think of a gambit in chess when one piece is bypassed in favor of a possible superior future outcome)

4) This is not a complaint, just a statement: Many people think the naked Terminator seen in the last part of the movie was played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor was really Roland Kickinger with Arnold's face tweaked onto Roland's body via CGI.

3578340,5,B001FB55I0,"I'll agree with other reviewers that this will probably be a movie most will either love or hate. Personally, I loved the movie and thought it was a great followup to the other Terminator movies. Be warned, however, that if you go into this movie expecting it to be like the past films- well, you be the judge. Whereas the other films dealt with alot of storyline about the Terminators, Cyberdine and Skynet; this film does very little to push that envelope along. In its' place, all we see are alot of action sequences with different types of machines and some Terminator action but not alot. Other than that, the cast was well chosen with all giving solid performances.

The story takes place in 2018. Judgment Day has come and gone. John Conner is hard at work trying to convince the rest of the world that he is the key to their salvation from the Terminators. Marcus Wright is a death row prisoner who submits his body to experiments as penance for crimes he has committed(yet only hinted at in the movie). Awaking in 2018, Marcus discovers that the world has been destroyed and is no longer as he remembers it. Along his way, he meets up with Kyle Reese and that's where the movie pretty much starts.

While I think Termintor Salvation is a great movie, it was pretty much done in McG's over the top style of filmmaking that he did in Charlie's Angels/Charlie's Angels:Full Throttle.",1259971200,,1389,4.596774193548387
3578341,5,B001FB55I0,"No!  This is not ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S Terminator.  And NO, James Cameron's hand was not involved directly with this film.  The lore of the Terminator Franchise has actually grown beyond requiring Arnold's presence or James Cameron's input, although a very good CG version of a younger & buff Governator DOES appear in the film.  I was ecstatic that we FINALLY got to see Chapters from the war of the last remnants of humanity against the machines, whereas the other films only teased us with brief glimpses of the conflict.  THIS storyline sets the stage for FUTURE chapters.  While THIS Terminator movie lacks some of the tounge & cheek dialogue that the previous movies contained, it is JUST as good in terms of action, mission, storyline, & acting performances, especially from the newcomer, Sam Worthington, who portrays Marcus Wright and actually has as much if not, more screen time than Christian Bale.
I actually wondered if Christian Bales' on set tirade or political maneuvering not only resulted in lackluster reviews for THIS movie by the ""Critics"", but also resulted in the cancelling of one of the most intelligent and action packed sci-fi series to come along since ""Firefly"", ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"".  Unfortunately, it ENDED with the same results.  A show ""TERMINATED"" before its time.  I'm just glad that we will at least see another installation of this film franchise, as this movie was contracted along with a sequel.  I thought McG did an excellent job and I look forward to seeing what he does with the next instalment!

If you enjoy the Terminator franchise, you will most likely enjoy this movie too.  It's not as good as T2, but IMO is a lot better than the 3rd movie.  I gave Terminator Salvation 5 stars because its a movie that I will watch and enjoy many times over, not necessarily because its the best Terminator movie.  I also like the fact that the Director's cut is INCLUDED instead of being repackaged 3 times (like ""Watchmen"") and the extras are cool too.",1259971200,,2013,4.882352941176471

I thought that this movie was a nice departure from bad cyborg-good cyborg fights. it was cool to see Roland Kickinger with a CGI of Arnold's face, as Arnold played a T-800 in all 3 Terminator movies. it was freaky how the cyborg gun turret recognized Marcus Wright, but did not shoot at him, because it knew that he was a Terminator cyborg. it didn't matter to me that Arnold was not in this movie, because I got a good thrill out of it none the less.",1259971200,,689,4.267175572519084

3578345,3,B001FB55I0,"While I agree the movie is OK if you are above the age of 15; however, I share the disappointments with Warner Bros.'s disregard for suppling their CLIENTS with the normal, expected Dig Copy advertised.  IT IS NOT INCLUDED and you have to go on-line, down load the instructions onto your own media, then follow the instructions to finally say something you sincerely hope the kids did not over-hear. For me, who installs multi-user accounting applications, grew wary with everything that had to be done in hopes that my son may get the dig copy by Christmas.  As if the holidays aren't stressful enough!

Disneys/Pixar's UP, FOX/20th's Museum @ Smithsonian, Paramount's STAR TREK, etc. digital copies were all INCLUDED inside the package, along with activation codes.  SIMPLE, getting what you're paying for!  I like that - a LOT!

However, I agree with a lot of other reviewers:  We consumers are getting nickel & dimed to death with taxes (ok, won't go there), with upgrades that should have just been offered at the get-go.  But to continue to buy multiple copies of the same movie to get an alternate ending, deleted scenes, director's what nots is getting tiresome.  MS has built an empire perfecting this.  I urge the struggling movie industry to just DO THE RIGHT THING:  Give us what we want right from the get go, it is worth the extra buck.  My life can't be revolve around a movie!?  I'll just keep watching Star Trek and Battle at the Smithsonian movies.  BOTH ARE EXCELLENT and I received EXACTLY what I ""thought"" I was buying.  As the kids' say:  Awesome!

3578347,4,B001FB55I0,"for the movie itself, i give it 5 stars. I loved Terminator Salvation. But overall, the Director's cut was kind of a let down.

the regular version is exactly 115 minutes, Director's Cut is 117 minutes. THe only real added shots in the Director's cut is a surprise terminator attack at the beginning of the film (when Connor leads his men down the water filled tunnel), a bit more Connor speach where he mentions his mom right before ""then what is the point in winning"" and the ""nude"" shot of Moon Bloodgood.

the 2nd disc features 2 Terminator Salvation features. the 1st one is solid, called ""Refocusing on the future"". This feature runs about 20 minutes and is pretty neat, but way too short. Clerks 2 for exampled had a feature that ran over 1 hour covering everything from pre-production to post production.

the 2nd feature has about 4 short (3-5 minutes each) features that talk about the moto-terminators, the return of Arnold, the use of the Air Force in helping with the film, etc.

Overall, the movie is awesome, but the DVD Director's cut is a let down when you really think about it. They really could have just stuck everything on one DVD instead of 2.

for this reason, 4 stars.",1259971200,67,1193,4.582159624413146

The script also failed to close the loop and send Kyle back to save Sarah.
The basic problem is that somebody other than James Cameron was allowed to direct the sequel Terminator movies. The second one was not terrible, but the T3 and Salvation were way off from what they could have been.",1259884800,,666,4.558333333333334

3578400,3,B001FB55I0,"Terminator 4 is not per se a bad movie, but its not a very good one.  The problem lies with the director's choices which parallel the scripts choices, that is, the concentration on machines.  The director is far more interested in the special effects and creating the bleak environment of post-judgment day using computers and machines than the characters themselves.  Similarly the script is more interested in the ""fake"" terminator of Marcus than in John Connor or humanity.  Though I don't want to reference the great earlier terminator movies, what's was crucial to the story is that it was humanity struggling to survive and fighting to prevent the future.  Sadly, this movie loses both of these things, being set in a time where the future was created, with characters are two-dimensional at best.  Why does John Connor fight the machines?  He doesn't seem to have any actual desire to fight, but only does so because its what he was told to do.  Similarly the soldiers are largely emotionless and uncaring, not interested in doing anything but destroying things.  Oddly the only character who has even a little humanity is a machine, marcus.  Sadly, I didn't really care about him as there is no real reason to, other than he's the protaganist of the story.  Sadly this movie reminds me of how I felt watching arnold as the first terminator, it was tense, dark, and muscular, but completely lacked any feeling.

As to the blu-ray, I feel there is going to be a double dip down the line, as there are very few features, and the ones that exist aren't that great.  However, the picture looks pretty great, especially the effects.  Maybe worth renting, but I can't see it in my collection.",1259884800,,1693,4.77319587628866

""Terminator: Salvation"" did what it was supposed to do. ENTERTAIN! So the Blu-Ray edition had a director's cut, so the DVD didn't have extras. So all the folk who saw it at the theaters were stupid?

""Terminator: Salvation"" is first and foremost, a Sci-Fi film (which means that it most likely will play fast and loose with things like physics, technical jargon, weapons with an unlimited supply of ammunition, among others. All three of the previous films of the franchise did the same thing (but it didn't stop any of the grousers from seeing it, anyway).

The story is only a snippet of the story of John Connor, meaning the franchise has a looooong way to go yet. I happen to like the ""new"" terminators (and there were a bunch!) introduced, and the pace was lightning quick, meaning I had to watch certain segments over, to get full effect. Yes, the acting was two-dimensional at times, but this is a Sci-Fi/Action film, and considering Schwartzeneggar's portrayals in the first three films, not unexpected. Still, the film doesn't suffer because of this. The story is still engrossing for those devotees of the franchise.

It's funny that with the exception of Christian Bale, the better known actors like Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Ironside and Jane Alexander were relegated to what were essentially bit parts. It's sad, too, because Jane Alexander is such a wonderful actress! The rest are relative unknowns, with maybe Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog) and Bryce Dallas Howard being notable exceptions. Still, the performances were good.

I won't go into specific details of the story, as there are many here who just had to jump on their computer to get their reviews in FAST, so as to lay it bare, thinking they were doing us all a favor.

Newcomer Sam Worthington was good in this, too.  If you read the reviews, you'll see what's driving the number of stars down is the fact that people don't like it that there are extras on the blu-ray version, but not the regular dvd version.

I don't agree with the way that some of the additional scenes were dropped in, but it probably serves the film better to not have eloquent wipes and dissolves.  That way, the viewer is dropped into it and it's an enjoyable ride.  McG and Co. really put forth the effort on this film, and contrary to the scathing reviews by the so-called ""professionals"", it is rather enjoyable.  It sure as hell beats most of the other films that came out around the Summer period!

The action, effects, and storytelling were done very well.  However, there are times when Worthington and Bale's Australian and English accents came out in the dialogue.  I must admit that it distracted me from the experience and reminded me that it was ""just a film"" until the next chase or explosion came along.

The Bonus Features Disc has some great behind the scenes and ""how they did it"" stuff, but was kind of short and felt like there could have been more.

Overall, a good effort and a good starting point for a new series of films.  Terminator films, even with their flaws, take us on a wild ride.  Mission accomplished.  I await the next one!",1259712000,17,1228,4.472972972972973

We've seen it all and it takes a lot to move us, inspire us, make us feel the gamut of emotions and be entertained.  Yet this installment of the Terminator series does just that.  IMHO, it ranks as one of the best epic science fiction movies ever produced.

The acting is outstanding, the characters are endearing, compelling and artfully developed.  Christian Bale plays the perfect relentless and conflicted John Connor. Sam Worthington beautifully brings the brave heart of Marcus Wright to life along with the tragic circumstances of his existence.  Moon Bloodgood excels at playing the beautiful Blair Williams a woman with unflinching strength and conviction.  The sweet youthfulness and fearless persona of Anton Yelchin playing a perfect Kyle Reese along with newcomer Jadagrace Berry (Star) together make the perfect complement of innocence contrasting starkly with their life on the bleeding edge.

The special effects were first rate, along with the script, sound and pace of the movie.  If you love sci-fi, you're going to love this movie.",1259712000,4,1120,5.247191011235955

There's no reason at all that the unrated version should not be available on DVD.  I understand that DVD cannot match the picture quality or sound that Blu provides, however, DVDs have always been able to support audio commentaries and bonus featurettes and to not put them on the DVD and still charge the same prices is ridiculous.  With all the firmware problems on Blu and the fact that my TV does not support HDMI (and I'm not replacing the TV until it breaks).  The more that studio pull this garbage the less likely I will ever convert to Blu.  In fact, I now hope the Blu format fails in favor of digital downloads for HD (with DVD still being available of course).  Very, very stupid Warner.",1259712000,9,874,4.487341772151899

As the time progresses, your hope of the filmmakers salvaging the project or building up to something really great fades away, and you're left with an ending that was obviously changed at the last minute and doesn't fit with the rest of the movie (not that the original ending could have been much better). I don't know how you can pour so much money and talent into a film like this and have this be the product. It's a stunning failure when you think about it. The special effects are great and there is a lot of action, and you can tell they even TRIED to put some depth into the story, but even these solid ingredients somehow turn bitter when thrown together the way they are in this movie. Perhaps the movie's worst offense is the dialogue. The very first scene sets the bar for the film so low that you wouldn't think it could possibly get any worse, but apparently the director loves a challenge and he found a way. By the end of the movie you won't care if all the characters die, in fact, you might even wish they did.",1259712000,7,1129,4.255813953488372

The Special Features are good except that many, maybe most, are devoted to showing that McG, the Director, is a genius. He makes the claim that none of the explosions (and there are a ton (but that's in all the Terminator movies) are just for impact that all contribute to the story; not so in my opinion. For example one massive firefight and explosion when the 'Cyborg' or whatever it is escapes is largely pointless. Moon Bloodgood sustains a minor injury, but otherwise, nada.

The so-called 'Director's Cut' is a joke. The only thing in adds is a side view of Moon Bloodgood's breast. McG obviously wants people to think he is the new James Cameron, but he is not. He does do a good job of being much more faithful to the story line than T3 and also sets up more Terminator movies without being too heavy handed. But this is not a classic.

By the way, the 'special features' definitely answer the question of whether it is the 'real' Arnold or a CGI 'Arnold.' But you'll have to see it for yourself, I won't spill the beans.",1259712000,,1170,4.3136363636363635

3578478,3,B001FB55I0,"Not really. That quote was a part of Christian Bale's infamous meltdown/tirade recorded on the set of this film (Hear it on youtube). After watching the extended director's cut of this film, I can now understand and sympathize with Mr. Bale's tension on the set...he obviously came to the realization that this was not one of his better career choices and became crankier as the project wore on.

This film only passes because it's a part of a much broader canvas in the franchise. You can find moments to like in the film because you like the Terminator films you grew up with or you like specific actors in the project. Sam Worthington singlehandedly saves this film from being a total failure.

Pro: For any fan of the previous T films, we finally get to see a storyline that takes place in the ""future"" post judgment day.

Con: We have to sit thru a poorly thought out T film storyline in the hands of a hack director that wants to only be known to the world as ""McG"". Whenever you see McG in a film's credits, you know can't be good and expectations need to be tempered WAY down.

Pro: In a post-apocalyptic wasteland where everyone is dirty, Bryce Dallas Howard manages to get a hold of amazing makeup to keep her looking fresh, glossy and ready for WAR!

Con: For a future full of Terminator machines running the planet, we sure don't get to see them very often and if we do it's only one moving special effect robot at a time. During a fight in a Terminator killbot FACTORY we only see ONE working Terminator taking on our heroes.

Con: So very many plot holes in this bad script.

Con: Did I mention McG? Director's cut does not mean a better film...it means more bad choices by this guy.

Anyway.....

This movie is excellent. Great story of redemption. The character Marcus is a death row inmate then changes and becomes hero to mankind, saving John Connor in the end. He gets his second chance at life.
There are many great nods to the other movies. You see how John Connor gets his scar seen in the very first movie. You see the T-800s as they come out of the factories(has the Arnold look), great touch to the 1984 movie.
There is lots of action too and many different versions of the enemy, from snake like to King Kong sized to the evil looking T-600s.
I reccomend this to any Terminator fan.
4 stars for the actual movie and 1 star for the poor dvd release. This was the best action movie of the 2009 summer.

3578543,3,B001FB55I0,"The Terminator franchise is an odd beast.  Since the original 1984 feature, it has been sold to three (soon to be four) different production companies and two different studios.  The only times the plot and dialogue have blended well together were in the first two movies, thanks to the care and writing skill of the younger James Cameron.  Since then, the timeline, plot, and characters of Terminator have gone through mutations and minor changes, either to the delight or disappointment of fans (usually the latter).  For a franchise that doesn't have millions of fans like Star Trek or even Battlestar Galactica, Terminator still has legs.  And Terminator Salvation was a great opportunity to tie some loose ends left over from the last movie and TV series, and reboot the franchise in the hopes of producing a John Connor trilogy.

This film is either the first film of a  second trilogy, or an intermediate movie while the future of the franchise goes up for bid in a Hollywood auction in 2010.  So how is this movie?

First the bad news.  Some of the dialogue, as is the case in too many action films, is poor.  I've always believed movie producers should hire more than script doctors.  They should hire an experienced screenwriter or playwright to give the dialogue a go-over.  The plots are usually okay.  But the words coming out of character's mouths can always use an upgrade.  Again, I look at Aliens as a model in how smart action movie dialog should be written.  At least the dialogue in Terminator Salvation holds together for the first 20 minutes of the 117 minute director's cut.

Slightly less bad news - if the director prefers to be known as 'MCG' (Joseph McGinty Nichol), and whose previous works were the two Charlie's Angels films, you know he's going to spin his wheels and show-off a little bit.  And MCG does.  But he also proves for the first time that he is capable of assembling top-grade action sequences that are both thrilling and comprehensible (unlike Christopher Nolan, who seemed incapable of directing a good action sequence in The Dark Knight, IMO).  MCG seems to have done his homework.  His attention to detail setting-up and executing action sequences is similar to the directors he grew-up with (George Lucas, Brian DePalma, John Woo, James Cameron).  If I were the executive producer, I would have wanted Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men) to direct, or at least a director who didn't give himself a nickname.

And finally, the movie does go off the rails a bit towards the end.  The second half of the movie is poor and cliched.  Christian Bale gets more screen time in the second half, but the final acts test the boundaries of medical and physical plausibility.  Also the second half is weighed-down by b-movie explosions, obvious homages to the first two Terminator movies, and brief tips of the cap to The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Aliens (not so brief with the last movie, as the entire climax seems to replicate Ripley's Rescue).  The first half of the film is clearly better than the second half.  At least the two halves are bridged by a most impressive (and original) chase and battle sequence in which all the great elements of the film come together beautifully.  That sequence is simply crackerjack.

But everything else in the movie I see as good news, in varying amounts.  Masio Kassar remained as executive producer (from T2 and T3) and hired as much Terminator talent as he could - namely the editor and an apprentice of Stan Winston's.  The casting is fine.  The photography, despite being handled by a disliked, unorthodox DP, is excellent, and matches the film's bleak theme and outlook.  The sound design is close to brilliant, with the machines sounding radically different from the previous three movies to awesome effect.  Danny Elfman's restrained score stays off the soundtrack during most action sequences, allowing the jet engines and explosions to speak for themselves.  Art direction and costumes are all first-rate.  Special effects are almost all top-notch, with the exception of a few cheap explosions and some of the aircraft shots.

Some plot weaknesses and poor dialogue aside, this is a wonderfully bleak movie.  Mankind is almost doomed.  The machines are smarter and sometimes more brutal than the previous films.  The machines are not always consistent in their speed (hey they have to take their time to aim at our heroes), but they are always quick to destroy human vehicles before humans, and that is a very welcome bit of smart military strategy on their part.  And some humans are fairly brutal as well.

It's tough for a studio to have a bleak movie as its summer tent pole, but that's what Terminator Salvation was to Warner, which struck box office gold a year earlier with The Dark Knight.  Terminator Salvation failed to crack the # 1 spot in its opening weekend.  But it will be remembered for being the best Terminator feature in 18 years, and that is saying quite a lot.",1259625600,36,4970,4.81582054309327

The action sequences were nicely done as well.  The Blu Ray looked just as good as I remember in the theater and comes with a nice amount of extras considering the cheap price it's selling for.  Don't expect alot from the added three minutes.  There were a couple small scenes I noticed and the rest were indiscernible.  Looking forward to T5.",1259625600,7,682,4.570247933884297

It has one good action sequence early in the film (though even that steals ideas from Transformers).  The big action sequence at the end is nothing more than Terminator 1's end action scene all over again, right down to the 'Help me, John!' lure by the terminator.  I went in with low expectations, which usually means I can be pleasantly surprised by any redeeming qualities.  There weren't many, in the case of this film.  Sam Worthington plays a character worth watching though.  Christian Bale's character was drab and uninteresting.

However, the trailers looked great, so I hoped he actually was onto something. Then literally 5 minutes into the film, when John Connor crawled out of wherever he was and everything was gone for some reason not known, I knew that my worse fears came true.
The plot was very weak and completely disjointed and at time undecipherable. Christian Bale who I really like slept-walked through this role, and his whispering of his lines was extremely annoying.
Why they entrusted this franchise to a music video director with a wannabe rapper/DJ name(What is up with the name McG??? Are you serious?),I have no idea. He screwed this up as badly as the Fantastic Four director (and they let him at it twice, oh no!)",1259452800,7,833,4.751724137931035
3578580,4,B001FB55I0,"It should really have ended with TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY, with the horrific post-apocalyptic future finally averted and that credo ""No fate but what we make"" resounding triumphantly in our ears. At least James Cameron knew better than to muddy up the waters, knew better than to mess up the perfect ending. In Hollywood, though, it's all about milking that cow dry, and the Terminator franchise was too lucrative to leave alone. Hell, the Governator couldn't turn down a third installment. Except without Cameron helming it and with Nick Stahl's negligible turn as John Connor (and with Arnie no longer looking so spry), TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES came up blah. And they still, still, still wouldn't let it rest.

TERMINATOR: SALVATION feels like, looks like, smells like a lead-in to yet further sequels. Setting down the haterade cup for a sec, I admit it's a technically well-executed film. It brims with dazzling special effects. It soaks in gritty, ominous atmosphere. It's the story itself that is found wanting. A story with this post-apocalyptic premise, in which the human race is on the verge of obliteration, it should make you want to root for humanity's survival. But, thanks to some weak characterization, I find myself not really giving a toss for anyone except for Sam Worthington's character.

If the trailer hadn't already given it away, then the opening sequence, set in 2003, spoilers it but big as death row inmate Marcus Wright (Worthington) signs a contract to have Cyberdyne have its way with his corpse. He does this in exchange for a kiss from Helena Bonham Carter, which would've been a cute moment except that it went by too abruptly. Cut then to the year 2018, and Judgment Day has happened. Everywhere lie the decay and ruins of civilization. The Machines have taken over. This isn't yet the time of John Connor. At this stage he is regarded by what's left of the human resistance as either savior or false prophet. At this stage John Connor is a respected and influential soldier in the Resistance, but, as the movie starts, he comes off as more or less still just one of the guys, just one of the soldiers, even if his peers know all about his perceived destiny. In 2018, John Connor ranks only second on Skynet's hit list.

The person Skynet would most like to neutralize is a teenager named Kyle Reese, and even the casual fan is well aware that the Terminator mythos is very dependent on Kyle Reese. However, I don't get the logic in Reese being more crucial for Skynet to stop than John Connor. Connor doesn't know where Kyle is, but we learn that Kyle and a mute little girl comprise the entire Los Angeles-based resistance. Who knows how much longer these two could've waged their losing battle against Skynet's war machines, except that it's around here that Marcus Wright inexplicably resurfaces, asking what day and year it is and seemingly stunned at the rampant devastation stretching to the horizon. Marcus Wright's last memory is being executed in 2003 and his presence now in 2018 has already altered the time line. Elsewhere, John Connor tells his wife: ""Something has changed. This is not the future my mother told me about."" The only question is whether Marcus is someone from the past or something deployed from the future by Skynet. Either way, Marcus promptly proves to have exceptional survival skills.

I liked this movie, liked enough about it that I don't really feel like slamming it too hard. The first two Terminator movies and even the SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES have built up enough good will that, even though I was a bit iffy about this fourth entry, I knew I was gonna be in the theater when it opened up. The story itself isn't all that and feels disjointed in spots. The core narrative follows Marcus Wright, but a key sub-plot involves the Resistance's discovery of a device which emits an override signal and renders the Machines inert. This kill switch is crucial to the Resistance's plan to take the fight directly to Skynet. This is pretty ho-hum stuff to me, and doesn't at all give me what I crave for, which is a series of absorbing character moments involving folks other than Marcus (Marcus has plenty of character moments).

Thankfully, the incredibly intense action sequences and the special effects carry the movie, with the CG being wicked spectacular. And I dig the colossal Transforminator! Director McG and his crew really sell the harrowing, dirty, grainy future world and establish that palpable sense of bleakness, that sense that man has lost his place as the dominant species on the planet. Sam Worthington plays sympathetically, and never mind that his Australian accent peeks out every now and then. The film's emotional core absolutely revolves around Marcus Wright. You certainly connect with him more than with the grim and tortured John Connor, and going by the quality of Worthington's performance, AVATAR has got itself a crackling good lead. Anton Yelchin as the teenaged Kyle Reese does a good job of channeling Michael Bienh's mannerisms. And to ***SPOILER*** the rest of this sentence, there's a serious fanboy moment when a certain T-800 makes an appearance.

When that military defense program known as Skynet achieved self-awareness, who would've thunk it that several of its cyborgs (including the T-800 from T2) would demonstrate more charisma and soulfulness than would the robotic Christian Bale as John Connor? And someone please tell the guy he's not on the Batman set anymore?

TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES taps Kate Brewster as a key figure in the Resistance, except that, here, she does a lot of standing around, and it doesn't help that it's the lifeless Bryce Dallas Howard taking over that role (not that Claire Danes was any great shakes). Moon Bloodgood is sexy but superfluous, and, speaking as a dude, it's irksome that her nude scene was deleted. Absolutely, there's a jarring cut right around before the bandits attack Bloodgood's character, making it very apparent that a huge chunk of scene had been lopped off. The sense is that Bloodgood was supposed to provide a further emotional connection, and possibly even a romantic one, with Marcus. But all that is cut out. The Boy & His Robot theme is offered up again - between Kyle and Marcus, and between the little mute girl and Marcus - but it's not so convincing. And I resent the movie trying to manipulate us even more by introducing the ""Newt"" element.

That old no-nonsense pro Michael Ironside, whom I remember best from the original V mini-series, comes in to provide some much needed fire in the belly as the current Resistance leader. So that's good.

For someone touted as the savior of humanity, John Connor doesn't really do much until near the end, and so there's a credibility issue here. In the prior films, John Connor was either this shadowy figure lurking in the future or he was portrayed by unremarkable yahoos like Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl and that kid from the TV series. Meaning that, here we are somewhat caught up with the future time line and this is when and where John Connor is supposed to make his mark. He doesn't, and if Christian Bale hadn't insisted on expanding his John Connor role, word has it that the future messiah would've been relegated more to the background, maybe only as a raspy voice broadcasting over the radio, offering hope to the isolated pockets of survivors: ""This is John Connor. If you are listening to this - you are the Resistance.""

And one beef I've always had - but it's minor - is the Terminators' habit of throwing their targets around, instead of just efficiently snapping necks. And - okay, I'm ***SPOILERING*** this sentence - - - when Connor infiltrates the heart of Skynet, he encounters only two Terminators. Two! So, okay, one is supposed to be the very first T-800 model; I guess that's why there's only one of his type. And the second is a T-600. Only, this is the heart of Skynet! Where's the rest of its soldiers?

I miss Sarah Connor, her presence here relegated to voice recordings frequently consulted by John. But that's how good Linda Hamilton was.

SALVATION presents us with a passel of Hunter-Killer war machines (the T-600, T-800, the hydrobot, the self-automated motorbikes, the Infiltration Prototype, etc.) but, probably because this is a PG-13 flick, the threat level isn't as impressive and these metal suckers aren't as frightening. And if you're expecting SALVATION to resolve everything, to provide a capper to the franchise, that doesn't happen. If anything, the hokey ending sets up a new trilogy. And as much as I've been grousing for the past few paragraphs, I'll say again that I like this movie. SALVATION is a gritty war movie as much as it is a sci-fi thriller. It certainly bears repeated viewings for the many very cool fan moments provided, although, okay, a young Kyle Reese doesn't quite pull off the iconic ""Come with me if you want to live"" line.

In 2029, John Connor sends Kyle to 1984 to save Sarah Connor. This story being set in 2018, that's over a decade of stuff to chronicle. Yeah, man, this is gonna be another trilogy; it may even end up being a good one. John Connor still has a chance to convince us as that he IS one righteous mutha and that he's fated to lead humanity. But I can't help but agree with Linda Hamilton; this thing should've ended with the first two films, with ""No fate but what we make"" still the relevant rallying cry.

3578581,4,B001FB55I0,"When I heard that Christian Bale was starring in the newest TERMINATOR film, I flipped.  I mean, Bale's portrayal of Batman (or, rather, Bruce Wayne; I have qualms about his Batman voice, but that's another rant) helped rejuvenate the ailing franchise...hell, it brought it back from the grave.  I figured he could do the same for TERMINATOR as well, a series that started strong, became excellent, and then fizzled in the third entry.

Well...SALVATION is much stronger than TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES.  However, Bale isn't given much to work with--his character, John Connor, wasn't even the principle character in the original script.  SALVATION rests squarely on the broad shoulders of Sam Worthington, who thankfully is an actor worthy of the challenge.  Worthington plays Marcus Wright, a death-row inmate given a second chance as one of SkyNet's failed human/cyborg composites.  However, the film wavers between Bale and Worthington's characters, primarily because the studio knows that ignoring a big-name star like Christian Bale is a big no-no.  Dare I say it: this movie would have been stronger without Bale's presence.  (I know, it's almost blasphemous; but it's the truth.)

Also along for the ride is the talented Anton Yelchin (who also hit 2009 blockbuster gold in STAR TREK), as the guy who eventually goes back in time and sleeps with Connor's mother (look for voice cameos by Linda Hamilton).  We've also got a grossly under-used Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Ironside; Moon Bloodgood, who's a good fit for the role, although again there's not much to work with; and Bryce Dallas Howard, who doesn't quite mesh with the action stars she's surrounded with.  Add to that McG's uneven direction, and TERMINATOR: SALVATION comes off as another ""what it should have been"" film--not great, not spectacular, but entertaining enough to make up for RISE OF THE MACHINES.  Of course, that wouldn't take very much.  Also, let's face it: we would've loved a genuine Arnold cameo, his old age be damned.  Now THAT would have been true salvation.",1259452800,,2063,5.098214285714286

First off, this is not Arnold's Terminator. If you're expecting the same thing as the first three, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Nor is it a serious philosophical work. It is simply a continuation of the first three, from a somewhat different -- but not contradictory -- light.

The story follows John Connor and Marucs Wright, two very different individuals whose fates nonetheless seem intertwined. Connor leads a raid against one of Skynet's prisoner-holding facilities; in the process, many die. Connor makes it out alive, but so does someone else...Wright, who was being held in the facility, emerges a few minutes after Connor is extricated. Thus begins a long, twisted path on which both men embark. Along the way, they find themselves on the same team -- often doubting the other's intentions -- and yet at odds when the dark secret of Wright's resurrection -- after his execution before Judgment Day -- comes to light.

Meanwhile, they learn that Skynet is using them both to ensnare Connor as well as Kyle Reese, in order to manipulate history in their own favor; at the same time, Skynet is manipulating the Resistance itself, offering up a sort of ""Trojan Horse"" in order to take out high command.

There are many twists and turns along the rocky road to ""Salvation"" -- personal, and of the Resistance -- but both men make the journey. In the end, one will sacrifice all to give the other a chance at life.

Now, aside from my brief retelling (trying not to give away too much), my opinion. It's very well done, and highly enjoyable, to me at least. Obviously, there are many who disagree. But I enjoyed the twists and turns, and actually saw the movie several times while it was playing at my local theater. Would I recommend seeing it before you buy it? Yes, if for no other reason because so many are so disappointed in it. I, however, think it is one of the best, if not the best, in the series -- certainly better than 2 and 3 imho. Keep in mind that my parents were from the generation that saw and loved the first two in theaters, and I'm not; and, frankly, I don't know how much my Dad -- who loved the first -- would care for this one. I approach this having seen the first two around when T3 (which I wasn't terribly fond of) came out.

Also, this is best seen more than once to make certain that you catch everything; for a ""light"" movie (which it certainly is), it tends to jump about, and make sudden detours. Not unpleasantly, to me at least, but there it is. My advice? See it with an open mind, and don't expect a masterpiece. If you do, you might like it; I personally thought it was awesome.",1259366400,8,2660,4.542797494780793

Very mild spoiler alert...

The title of Terminator: Salvation is a contradiction-in-terms (or a promise of false hope...), in that this Terminator film will not be the ""salvation"" of the Terminator franchise, for there is something lacking in this fourth installment of the Terminator series.... And that is the vision and technical expertise and guiding hand of James Cameron... TS director McG is no James Cameron...

The first two Terminator films are modern classics-there is nothing in either film which does not contribute to the clockwork precision of their plots, which exhibit flawless logic... There is also a sense that the epic significance of the events depicted in the first two films is not present in TS-which ends with the promise of a sequel...

This film should have been the penultimate tale of the war between Skynet and the ragtag human resistance-but it gets caught up in unnecessary subplots and implausible developments... Major characters do exceedingly dumb things in TS...There are spectacular action set-pieces alongside jaw-dropping, ""why would anyone do that"" stupidities...

In this Terminator film, T-600's fight like humans... Unbelievable! Realistically, if a T-600 got it's hands on a human, it wouldn't waste time punching or throwing, it would simply and instantly kill him... Plus, there are far too many scenes in the film reminiscent of Spielberg's War of the Worlds... Especially with the ""harvesting humans"" sequence...

The story told in TS is in no way original or thought-provoking or awe-inspiring-as were the first two Terminator films, in spades! The breathless, euphoric  feeling I left the theater with after the first two films was not with me after seeing TS... The climax of TS is a huge letdown, with several incredulous developments relating to the human heart... TS is a dumb film, far too dependant on frenetic, extended, CGI action sequences to mask the insubstantial, illogical aspects of it's plot...

Christian Bale's John Conner should have been the focus of the film throughout, but he isn't... TS is essentially an ensemble film... Bale did far better work in a far superior film, with a similar dystopian theme and setting: Reign of Fire. The other characters in the film are never fully developed-especially Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogen of Cyberdine, who is seen in a short prolog set before Judgement Day, and then-towards the end of the film-as the face of Skynet... Why? Remember Zemeckis' Contact? McG did... I would like to have seen more of  the relationship between Conner and his pregnant wife, Kate, played by Bryce Dallas Howard-but we learn nothing more than they are quite fond of each other... The subplot featuring Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright and Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams starts out promisingly, but quickly becomes a detriment to the film's plausibility... Star Trek's Anton Yelchin (Chekov) is quite good as Kyle Reese, the true ""McGuffin"" driving the plot of TS...

For the first half or so of Terminator: Salvation I was caught up in the story being told, the unsatisfying denouement of the film brought me back to Earth... And I felt cheated yet again by another mediocre installment in a series which began so wondrously...

3578585,5,B001FB55I0,many of the old fan hates this movie. I am young fan and like the war of future. terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan. There so much to take advantage of.  If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling.  The moives does have it flaws like john Conner's wound at the end. Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie.,1259193600,,362,4.3088235294117645
3578586,3,B001FB55I0,"I was expecting great things after Christian Bales apparent lack of enthusiasm for T3. Unfortunately for him Terminator 3 Rise of The Machines is far superior to Salvation on every level, better storyline, characters, and much better climax to T4, which is really too derivative of T2's final set piece.

The problem with T4 is that it has no real story to it that you can speak of,
quite frankly it's a mess. Sam Worthington is totally miscast, and seems bored
throughout the whole movie. As for Christian Bale it's a case of now you see him, now you don't.

On the plus side it is full of special effects that fans will love. Ironically the gas station sequence and the subsequent chase scene following it, is the movie's saving grace. It's truly superb and is one of the best set pieces I have seen in any of the Terminator movies. I have not seen the Directors Cut but I am sure it has to be better than this.",1259193600,,913,4.396449704142012
3578587,5,B001FB55I0,"The director's cut runs approximately 3 minutes longer, and inserts a few new scenes, but no major plot points.  This is NOT the major unrated cut that McG has referred to in past interviews, where he suggested that 30-40 minutes of additional footage would be added.  We'll probably see that in a future edition.

Here are the major differences between the theatrical version and the director's cut (spoilers follow).

1) In the opening action scene, when John Connor is leading his unit into the flooded underground Skynet base, a T-1 terminator (nice touch from T3) suddenly appears behind them.  His men destroy it before it can do any damage.  I'm glad this scene was cut; it inadvertently breaks the tension too quickly.

2) When John pulls his little ""frogman stunt"", he is seated before the Resistance Command generals, and General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) berates John.  Ashdown says, ""I don't believe in prophecy, not when one can re-write the future"", pulls out his gun and points it at John's head.  I liked this scene, because it illustrates John's present and minor role in the Resistance, especially with Command being skeptical of his ""predictions"".

3) Blair Williams/Moon Bloodgood's topless scene; really just a side shot as she washes herself in the rain in a non-sexual manner, and Marcus glances at her briefly.

4) Marcus/Blair Williams/redneck fight; the action is a little longer, and a little more brutal.  Marcus stabs one of the attackers with a screwdriver, and we see the impact, as well as the victim painfully removing the screwdriver.  Also, Marcus uses another one of the attackers as a human shield against another's shotgun blast.

5) Marcus/Blair Williams campfire scene is slightly longer with additional dialogue between the two.

6) Captured humans at Skynet; when one of the prisoners attempts an escape and is shot, we see the bullet impacts.

7) John Connor's speech to fellow Resistance members to not obey Ashdown's orders to attack is extended with a few sentences about his mother.  I liked this scene, not sure why they cut it.  It ties T2 in, and shows the impact of Sarah Connor.  (Is this where Christian Bale had his stage lights tantrum?)

8) Marcus/T-800 fight scene is slightly longer, shows Marcus getting pummeled a bit more by the T-800.  Also, John tries to revive Marcus an additional time, before collapsing in exhaustion.

I would like to add that I enjoyed Terminator 4; much better than the campy T3, and just a shade under T2.  The action was definitely there, and McG included a lot of thoughtful touches from the past movies, e.g. photograph of Sarah Connor, the origin of John's scars, John's like for Guns N'Roses, Sarah Connor's taped voice recordings (actually Linda Hamilton's voice), use of and of course the Arnold cameo.  Who can say no to Michael Ironside?  What I didn't like was Blair Williams' geisha makeup which she wore during air combat.  It made no sense, and was probably one of the deleted portions.  Bryce Dallas Howard was believable as Kate Connor, but her screen time was too short.  Hopefully, a future cut will show more of her relationship with John.

Some have said that Christian Bale's performance was wooden, or that John Connor's role was overshadowed by Sam Worthington's role as Marcus Wright.  I disagree with both counts; Bale played Connor as he should have been; grizzled, scarred, gruff.  Given that we know so much already about the future and John's role from prior Terminator movies, it makes sense to have another character portray the center protagonist role.  I also liked the idea of the audience first seeing John as a minor Tech-Com officer, steadily rising through the ranks and gaining influence.

Additionally, the movie's opening and closing scenes had a poetic touch to it, which I appreciated.  Marcus begins the film about to be executed, giving his body to a cybernetic program.  The film ends with the same shots of needle plungers being depressed, albeit for a different reason.  Marcus leaves the world as a cyborg, but giving his body to a human cause.

I did have one concern about the movies; how come the Arnold T-800 didn't die when John Connor shot the molten steel onto its head?  Turns out there's a perfectly scientific explanation (McG consulted a metallurgist).

Here's McG's answer: ""There are different characteristics of molten steels, and that was an earlier steel process after it had been separated from the coke. We went over this with a metallurgist, discussing which metals burn at which degrees. And also, if it had stayed on [the T-800], perhaps it would've melted him, but it was frozen quickly enough by the [liquid nitrogen]. Plus, we make the transition from the molten metal to the cooling property so quickly -- as a function of the T-800 being on [John] Connor -- that it wouldn't have had time to melt the existing titanium exoskeleton in time.""

In conclusion, if you're a diehard Terminator fan, go ahead and pick up this version.  Otherwise, wait for the (hopefully) longer extended cut.",1259020800,254,5047,4.932464454976303
3578628,1,B001FB55I0,"Please, James Cameron, buy back the rights to Terminator (I hear Halcyon could use the money) and save us all from a continuing slew of mediocre ""sequels"" and a poorly executed, woefully under-budgeted, and ultimately canceled TV show (T3, this film, and TSCC).

The only good that's come out of the never ending milking of the franchise is the intriguing protector Terminator character of Cameron Phillips (portrayed by Summer Glau) from TV's The Sarah Connor Chronicles, who is smitten with one baffled and equally smitten John Connor (star-crossed lovers, anyone?).  That's it... end of story.

Don't get me started on Christian Bale's one-note embodiment of an older John Connor, or the cringe-worthy effort by Nick Stahl in T3, or the equally flat performance of Kristanna Loken as the TX, or the bland Marcus Wright hybrid played by Sam ""I look bored with my job"" Worthington in Salvation.

If James Cameron or someone of equal vision and skill could make an entertaining, intelligent, and timely sci-fi/action/adventure epic around a 20-something Cameron (again played by Summer) and a 20-something John Connor and make it an official T3 (ignoring Rise of the Machines and Salvation completely) I'd give this theoretical sequel a chance.  Heck, I'd even love Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick and even Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn to come back for more fun (you have time travel and alternate time lines, JD being pushed back even farther into the future, and a non-Cyberdyne Skynet-like entity evolving differently this time around, at your disposal, so anything is possible... even if the original cast is showing its age-- like us all).

3578630,2,B001FB55I0,"I saw Terminator: Salvation in theaters and I was extremely disappointed in how the origional story line that James Cameron created, went right down the toilet.

Here are the major issues I have with this movie:

  1. In Terminator 2 and even Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles, Sarah ALWAYS told John to run when he saw a machine. He is too important for the future. What do they have John doing in this movie? They have him on the front lines hunting the machines.
  2. Who is the leader of the human resistance? John Conner. Why is he reporting to superiors and taking orders from them? Who fricking knows. John should be giving orders, not taking them and having others report to him.
  3. Who is John's father? Kyle Reese. Do the machines know who John's father is? According to the first film, NO. All records were destroyed during the nuclear war, the machines had no clue who Conner's father was, but yet somehow Reese's name ends on the top of a list that the machines are targeting for termination. Then the machines find Reese, but don't terminate him. WTF? If the machines aquired their target, they would have terminated him ASAP, they would not have taken him to the work/slave farm.
  4. For those that have see Terminator 3, towards the end John asks the T-800 (Arnold) why he wasn't alive in the future and that his wife sent the T-800 back. The responce was: because of the emotional connection John had with the T-800 model when he was younger (Terminator 2) he infiltrated his base and killed John. Now in Terminator: Salvation John faces the new T-800 model, with a digitally imposed Arnold body. Does John die? No, he lives, but the laws of physics are completely shattered during the fight. John shoots a hole in a basin that has melted metal in it. It's pretty much molten lava. It spills on the T-800 and completely covers it, but the T-800 survives and contines coming after John. Wait a minute, didn't a T-800 and the T-1000 get destroyed in melted metal at the end of Terminator 2? Major screw up there if you ask me. Anyway, back to T4, the T-800 is after John, so he shoots a pipe, it bursts and splaches liquid nitrogen on it. The T-800 is frozen, but not defeated, because it breaks free and continues after Conner. Ok, so let me get this straight, the T-800 is covered in molten lava then frozen very quickly after and it can still move? Highly unlikely. If you know anything about going from extreme heat to extreme cold, especially with metal, it explands, then contracts and becomes brittle. So the T-800 would have been stuck because the joints would not have been able to move and Conner would have had an easy victory by beating the head and destroying the chip.

There are to many continuity issues from the origional James Cameron films that just don't follow into this forth installment. As far as I'm concerned, this forth film doesn't belong in the story line. If they continue with the series, they need to fix the errors they made otherwise, they will just ruin it for me.",1258848000,11,3023,4.569316081330869

3578633,2,B001FB55I0,"A few good ideas that were just terribly, terribly executed.

The reverse time traveler. I enjoyed that idea. Sam Worthington, con on death row is executed, but before dying signs his life away to Cyberdyne systems, wakes up in the future, and spends it trying to piece together what happened. Cool.

Beyond that...what the heck?
The first two movies (the REAL terminator movies) had this ever present mood to them. Mass human genocide was coming and there was nothing that they could do about it. People were going to die and it was just...really, depressing and threatening and remained this heavy presence just over the horizon.

But with Salvation...the apocalypse comes and...it's no big deal. Apparently much of the military managed to survive (chain of command included)John Connor is just a cog in the system who spouts gibberish over the radio, and... his father from the future is a fun loving, happy go lucky rogue...
None of which connects to the previous movies very well.

There is no emotional connection in this movie. The characters are just...boring. They're cardboard cut outs of people, people created to serve a purpose, but never given a chance to ever seem like real people. Hot American Indian chick, plot device to show Sam Worthington's character's humanity, and predictably help him out of a tight spot.  John Connor (Christan Bale), auto distrusts all machines which makes no sense given the previous movies. And we can't even go into all of the stupid mistakes that he makes for someone that was trained as a soldier and should know what the terminators are capable of. Bryce Howard playing John Connor's wife... Why does John Connor need a wife? Why does his wife play no conceivable purpose in the story whatsoever other than being there?
And could someone please tell me why Common was even in the movie other than he wanted to be? He must have something like 2 lines.

I think it's a steaming pile of crap. But I'll admit people have disagreed with me.

If you ignore the previous movies and take it as a stand alone. It's okay...maybe. I just feel that the studios have done to terminator what they did with the Aliens franchise. The good writer/director leaves and then the studios go right ahead and f- it up.

If you liked Alien vs Predator (all 5 of you) than you might enjoy this movie. The rest stay away...stay far away.",1258416000,3,2361,4.769607843137255

This is a popcorn movie.  Check your brain at the door.  It doesn't make good use of the Terminator franchise for sure but complaining about what could have been is pointless.  If you are a sci-fi or T fan this is a worthy bookend just for the visuals.  If you are not very familiar with the T franchise this movie tries to stand on its own with a little narration.  Ironically this movie doesn't actually advance the Terminator mythology at all since it tries too much to stand by itself.

They look and sound better - great - but is that a reason why you have to make that the ONLY way to own the Director's Cut?

Now, I really wanted to buy the Director's Cut DVD of this film, but it will only be on Blu-Ray.  Does the studio think I'm going to buy a Blu-Ray player just for 'Terminator Salvation?'  LOL no.  I didn't even do that for 'The Dark Knight.'

So, all the studio is doing is losing money by forcing me to have to download the Director's Cut, rather than purchase the DVD (which I wanted to do, since I have all of the other 'Terminator' films).  So, it looks like they'll be losing a lot of money with this stupid stunt of theirs.  People who don't have Blu-Ray aren't going to buy a player just for a movie like this, so this was a bad idea.

3578637,4,B001FB55I0,"As a James Cameron, Terminator and Christian Bale fan, I am disappointed with McG's mediocre treatment of Terminator Salvation. While the action sequences are solid and well-delivered, they do not make up for paper-thin character development and flawed story flow. The problem is that, with the exception of Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), we simply don't care about any of the characters or the fate of the Resistance. McG hasn't given us much to invest in emotionally and they're little more than minigun fodder. Not having much to work with, the normally excellent Bale is wasted here. This is the shallowest John Connor by far in the series, never being more than a gun-toting, one-dimensional ""blunt instrument"" of military force, to quote M from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casino-Royale/dp/B001DSNF8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casino Royale</a>. There are bits and pieces from previous Terminator movies sprinkled in here, along with other movies like Mad Max, War of the Worlds, and even some elements that resemble the Matrix's post-apocalyptic world, especially the mech designs. It's still entertaining, but Terminator fans could totally dismiss this version and go on with their lives. This is a superfluous summer blockbuster that brings nothing new to the Terminator franchise.

The ""Director's Cut"" isn't much of a director's cut. It only adds 3 minutes of brief Bloodgood boobage and more violence from the ensuing fight, not the 30-40 minutes of deleted scenes that McG has told fans in interviews would be included. The theatrical version is 115 min, the director's cut: a disappointing 118.

The story begins in 2003 with the scheduled execution of Marcus, a death-row inmate responsible for the deaths of his brother and two cops, but I had a hard time accepting the charismatic, handsome, contemplative, and remorseful Marcus as a killer. We don't know anything about his background or crime, except the feeling that he didn't intentionally kill these men and doesn't deserve to die. At the insistence of a freakishly bald and chemo'd Cyberdyne researcher, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), he donates his body to science. As Marcus receives his lethal injection, the scene blurs out to a text crawl about Skynet's awareness and the extermination of most of the human race on Judgment Day. Then film cuts right to 2018, to the middle of an assault on a Skynet research facility by Connor and his men. From there, it's one shoot-out or car chase after another, with little in the way of character development.

I get that the main storyline is about second chances and what it means to be human, but these two threads are clumsily handled. McG doesn't seem to know if this is the story of John, Marcus, or Kyle and Star. In here is the cliched perceptive child mute, akin to Newt's character from Aliens, and a stereotypically callous general (Michael Ironside looking a bit like Jack Nicholson) who cared about victory over all else, even at the cost of hundreds of innocent lives. Some ""WTF moments"" came with the mech designs, such as the towering Terminator/people harvesters (like War of the Wolds meets Matrix mechs), the robotic serpent Hydrobots, and Moto-Terminators (gun-mounted black chaser motorcycles) launched from the legs of the giant mech. Their art direction felt wrong in the Terminator post-apocalyptic universe, and really out of place, which has up until now, been mostly a 1-on-1 engagement of single Terminator vs hero. An essential story element is missing here: the strong antagonist. This time, we get 2 heroes (with John being upstaged by Marcus), and no unstoppable new super-Terminator. I also thought that there were an awful lot of people hanging around for a desolate, war-torn future. The Terminators just aren't very good at detecting people. They need loud noises and fire to be alerted to human presence. It's not very believable for a race of sentient machines with advanced weaponry.

As far as Terminator purists are concerned, the Terminator saga ended at 2, as James Cameron famously stated to the world. No one can replace Cameron (since he and Gale Anne Hurd created the original characters, and it was his creative vision that brought them to life), but that doesn't mean that fans of the series have to write off further efforts to extend the franchise. Though entertaining, McG adds nothing new here, and the ending is especially unsatisfying because it feels like he's taken us in a big circle. The character we care about has to die so that a character we don't care about can live. The humans may have won this battle, but the war is far from over and the ending crawl leaves the movie on a really pessimistic and circular tone, talking about fighting Skynets around the world so there's no closure or finality to the story. You can bet there will be a sequel.

In summary, this is an fun, action-oriented blast-fest with lots of nice CG and thrilling sequences, but very short on strong characters (except for Marcus). Terminator fans and action film enthusiasts will still enjoy it a lot. Just leave your brain at the door.",1257552000,,5151,5.105575326215896

I am so tired of them trying to shove Blue Ray down everyone's throats by forcing them to purchase BR instead of DVDs because they are not putting extras, or alternate versions, or even second discs with the DVD versions anymore. I don't own a Blue Ray player and I'm not buying one just so I can watch extras (however the extras are half the reason I buy a movie a lot of times). I'll keep buying regular old DVD's if they have the FULL PACKAGE or I won't buy any at all and wait until they release it with all the extras. It's crap.

I'm in the entertainment industry and I want to see the storyboards, the preproduction, the special effects, hear the commentary, etc. Every time a new wave of movies are released there's less and less on the DVD and they're putting it on TWO blue ray discs (which defeats the purpose of blue ray anyway - it's supposed to hold more and they're putting the same mount of content on 2 blue rays as they did on 2 DVDs). They're just trying to get as much money out of people as they can. It's CRAP.

3578686,3,B001FB55I0,"I just watched a screener of the director's cut, which is only 2-3 minutes more in running time than the theatrical version.  Let me first say that I thought this movie was solid from an action standpoint.  However, the myriad of plot holes, cheesy lines and bad acting moments from the theatrical version are still present in this Director's Cut!  Most of all, the infamous Moon Bloodgood topless scene is here....and it is TERRIBLE!! Description:  It's a short scene right before her character, Blair and Marcus get ambushed by thugs in the night.  For some reason, Blair walks out in the middle of the pouring rain and removes her top to wash her chest.  She covers her breasts with her hands, turns around at Marcus.  They give each other a long yearning stare...End Scene. I assume that McG was trying to force some kind of sexual tension between the two characters. Or maybe she was testing Marcus to see if she could trust him.  But why test him and have her gun more than 50 yards away for the thugs to find??  In short, the scene served absolutely no purpose in movie whatsoever and guess what, it didn't even show ""them"".  Poorly executed on every level and just embarrassing to watch!!

But the biggest problem I had with the plot is the belief that Connor had to save Kyle Reese.  This posed so many problems! The first 3 Terminator movies were about protecting the young John Connor to ensure the future.  But in Salvation, John Connor has to protect the young Kyle Reese to ensure the past, present AND future.  Clever writing, but still flawed because the movie basically takes the ""Back to the Future"" approach to time travel.  The belief that if Kyle Reese dies in the Resistance, then he can't go back in time.  Therefore, John Connor won't exist.  So does Connor actually believe that he could disappear out of thin air like in ""Back to the Future""???  What's even more perplexing is that John Connor is the hero, the prophet and the messiah in the movie. However, when he makes his big speech on the radio commanding the Resistance to stand down from bombing Skynet, his speech is very AMBIGUOUS.  As the viewer, you don't know if Connor intends to save the human prisoners in Skynet or just save Kyle Reese. In the previous Terminator films, it was justifiable for Sarah Connor and other characters to protect the life of John Connor.  But in Salvation, Connor protecting his own existence is theologically flawed.  Bottom line, is it okay for ""the messiah"" to save himself so he can be the savior of humanity in the future??  In my opinion, that is just sloppy and misguided story-telling!!

Other plot holes. 1) No explanation on why Kyle Reese was number 1 on the Skynet kill list. 2) When Reese was identified, why didn't Skynet kill him immediately? 3)Once Marcus entered the Resistance compound, why didn't Skynet just locate him and invade? 4) Worst of all, the heart of the film was literally a heart in the film!!!

I was hoping that the Director's Cut would address some of these plot holes, but it addressed NONE of them.  Unfortunately, McG seemed more preoccupied with cool, flashy one-take action sequences than story-telling. Rumor has it that there will be a FINAL CUT released after this Director's Cut.  Unless there were actual re-shoots, I highly doubt any of these problems will be fixed. Overall, the blame ultimately lies on the director McG.

Only briefly there was a single scene where one of the terminators sort of favored Arnold, even then it was a piss poor similarity to his character.

3578728,4,B001FB55I0,"Yet again we see one more movie from the Terminator Franchise. Ever since the first Teaser Trailer for Salvation was launched, I had been excited for this movie. Recently there had been very big speculation with this particular Movie, especially by the Critics World. I was surprised to see this movie getting whacked so much by the critics at [...] I have seen this movie at last and I can say this Movie deserved much more than what it received at Rotten Tomatoes. There is no doubt Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the best among the series. But this movie was better than T3: Rise of Machines.

When McG signed up for this movie I had been apprehensive because honestly, I hated Charlie's Angels. Terminator Salvation is a new beginning, so we should not compare with its predecessor. There is no time travel and of course no mission for hunting down the members of the Connors. High point of this movie is its action; it has been a long time since I had seen action like this. Special Effects incorporated are top notch. As far as character development is concerned... there are some places where certain elements are missing. Considering this as the start of the trilogy this can be forgiven. I hope this will be dealt with other upcoming series. Columnists have complained that Christian Bale was cold as John Connor. I can say that when the central character has been subjected to so many years of war, we can always expect to hope for less sentiment as that happens in today's reality. Terminator Salvation gyrates round the Character of Marcus Wright (Very well portrayed by Sam Worthington) & Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). This movie was meant to be action oriented so as to show us the apocalyptic world post judgment day. Apart from the stunning cinematography Danny Elfman's music gives us an edgy metallic score.

Since so many reviews have already given out the plot details of 'Salvation' I will not be writing it as it ruins the anticipation. Finished with that, closing notes will be every one should see this movie with an open mind rather than having a downbeat feeling for not having Arnold or 'Hasta la Vista, baby'

Note: Recently I heard that there might be some forty minutes of edited footage for the upcoming Terminator Salvation DVD. Expectantly it might give us some more details.",1256774400,4,2306,4.745635910224439

That is my big criticism with T4, it is a good action movie but thats it, there is no story.

It's good to know though that in the near apocalyptic future the women are still hot and shampoo is available in abundance (Bloodgood) as is makeup (Howard). And for me, the most annoying & recent trend from these movies: in I and II you just knew that if the Terminators got within a hair of their targets they were most likely toast, now in III and specially in IV they get to John Connor often, grab his shirt and throw him into the air while he miraculously lands on a soft surface, unfortunately for Skynet these more recent Terminators seem to be too dumb to figure out this isn't going to get the job done anytime soon.

From seeing the ruins of observation area where the first terminator arrived in T1, Marcus showing Reese how to handle a shotgun by tying a string to it which Reese did in T1 to help hide his gun in his trenchcoat, to a similar chase scene with a truck & the motor-terminators lookin like the first chace scene in T2, and even John Connor playin ( You Could Be Mine)
by Gun's N Roses to lower a motor-terminator into a trap etc. Anton Yelchin really impressed me as a young Kyle Reese throughout the film just as Sam Worthington played a great cyborg who later finds out he's a pawn to eliminate mankind. Christian Bale pulled off John Connor well himself. As for Moon Bloodgood, Common, & Bryce Dallas Howard i would say it was unfair to discredit them when they didn't get that much screen time. But anyways, if you're a true terminator fan you will enjoy this film. Especially the climax that leaves you wondering what awaits John connor in further battles.

That was a big mistake, that's like making Rambo a G-rated film, it's just not right.  Christian Bale is good as John Connor, he gives an alright performance, but he could have done a little better.  Anton Yelchin (Young Kyle Reese) did a superb job portraying the young hardened soldier who will eventually go back to protect young Sarah Connor, but not in this film.  The movie is good, but due to editing and script changes here and there, caused the movie's poor performance at the box office.  It's still a good film to watch, it gives us a fresh new look at the world post Judgment Day.  It's NO James Cameron film by a long shot, but still decent with good action.  Just don't expect to follow the plot as it has it's ups and downs by the different writers that wrote the screenplay.  Expect a future blu-ray/dvd Terminator Salvation: Extended Cut (I don't know what they will call it) to contain most of the deleted scenes 30-40 mins worth with the original ending and an alternate storyline to debut sometime in late 2010.  It's an alternate version of the film, much like Donner's Superman II cut.

In terms of quality of production, acting, effects, it's top notch. It just doesn't flow as well as the earlier films.

So in my opinion it would come in 4th behind the previous films. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it or thought it was bad.......just not quite the experience for me as the earlier films.  Will still buy it though when it comes out on Blu-Ray

3578893,3,B001FB55I0,"This movie to me was a disappointment. The terminator series is one of my favorites but this movie was just a let down. Now, for the avid action flick person that is only interested in good action this movie is great. But for the terminator fan who wants to see some good story progression and the series go forward, this movie is a letdown.

1)I'll start off with my first complaint, even if it is a small one. I'm not a fan of Christian Bale. I think he is a GREAT GREAT Batman, but a John Connor he is not. Even though the John Connor in T2 annoyed the crap out of me, I'd rather see him again than Christian Bale. The fact that this movie was more about Sam Worthington's character than John Connor should be a negative, but the fact that this made me have to endure Bale's horrible acting less made it not such a negative.

2)Overall, what was the point of this film? I can only think of 2 important happenings in this film. 1) Connor meets his father and 2) Connor becomes the leader of the resistance. (and the 2nd really could have been lumped somewhere else) I mean, basically, the only thing that happens in this movie is John Connor and the resistance are able to take out a region of skynet. Why did I have to endure Bale for 2 hours to see that? Worthington's character in the grand scheme of things was pointless. T1, the whole story of judgement day and the terminators is set up...important. T2, (and IMO the worst of the first 3) the same story is furthered and for the first time a machine is working for the humans...important. T3, the realization that judgement day cannot be prevented and it actually happens...important. T4...yeah nowhere near as important as the first 3.

3) Why all of a sudden can the terminators survive molten steel? In T2, arnold offs himself (not directly) by being lowered into a pool of molten steel but in this movie, molten steel gets poored all over the T800 and it busts out? Bahh

4) How predictable was this movie? Connor gets stabbed through the heart and robo-worthington gives his up? I guess we should ignore the fact to have a heart transplant, the dimensions of your chest cavity have to be pretty close, and your bloodtype has to be the same or compatible.

5) Where was Kate Connor? I mean she is a huge character in the terminator series after judgement day? She is the future leader of the resistance and, while I think Howard did a good job with her, there wasn't nearly enough of her.

Overall, I think this is the worst terminator movie so far. Does it kill the series for me? No. I realize that every series has to have a low point. Now if T5 is as bad as this movie, then the series may well be dead for me. I hope by the time it comes out, Christian Bale can muster up some non-bruce wayne acting skills and pull off a respectable John Connor. I still think this movie is worth seeing and if you aren't a HUGE terminator fan like me, then you will probably like this movie. The movie, by itself is decent. The movie, when put with the other terminator movies, not so decent.",1251417600,5,3044,4.35978835978836
3578894,3,B001FB55I0,"Terminator: Salvation follows `X-Men Origins: Wolverine' as one of the most pointless sequels/prequels of 2009.  It is better than Wolverine, but the film still is full of plot holes and a lack of lining up with any of the previous films.  There are good things in this movie, but there are also some bad things, and there is one thing that made me want to rip someone's head off.

The Good
1. The Marcus character is interesting

2. Fresh out from Star Trek Anton Yelchin continues to prove an extraordinary ability mimicking characters to perfection.

3. A CGI body double of Arnold in his prime is very well-done.

4.  A solid effort is put into the film's special effects.  They are the real reason this film is worth seeing at all, so Christian Bale should shut up, because I applaud the FX and lightning crew for this film more so than the director and the actors.

The Bad
1. Christian Bale seems to think he's playing Batman in a Mad Max setting.

2. Action scenes are so far over the top that many lose any form of believability- even if your brain is turned off

3. A lack of clever dialogue.  Even Terminator 3 (another cheesy, bad film) had some good lines and moments.
4. Clich laden script.

5. Too many references to the previous film ruin an experience.  It's just hard to take a film seriously when the actors keep on winking to the audience.

6. Lack of continuity is a big pain for veteran Terminator fans.  In this movie terminators are suddenly able to be taken down by machine gunfire (yes, I know these are ""pre T-800 models,"" but still...) and when the T-800 finally enters it survives a molten steel bath (doesn't that equal death according to the previous films?)

The Ugly

1. The film ends with the cheesiest quote I have ever heard in a big-budget action movie.  I won't spoil it, but when you hear Christian Bale's final quote you will want to slam your head into the nearest wood surface until you bleed.

For Terminator fans the film is worth seeing at least one-time, either in theater, or via rental, but I wouldn't want to own this film.  Sure, I may rent it just to watch it again if I'm in the mood for a Terminator marathon, but I don't think it's worth the price, or space to own.  The film tries to be dark and gritty, but it comes across as being just a camp filled as Terminator 3, and the Mad Max inspired settings in no way reflect the dark future presented in the James Cameron flash backs.  Even the clips in Terminator 3 were far more accurate to the future James Cameron imagined.",1250726400,5,2528,4.424242424242424
3578895,4,B001FB55I0,"Boy, this got hammered by most critics. But I don't know what the problem was - I know it's pretty grim from start of finish, and it doesn't have the humor of the earlier Terminator flicks. But I thought this was really well done, and that both Christian Bale and especially Sam Worthington did a fine job, the story moved along quickly for a 2-hour movie, and there were enough twists and turns to keep me interested throughout. Besides, how can you not love a movie who's leading babe is named Moon Bloodgood (REAL name, not her character!)I think it was unfairly maligned because of the high budget and Bale's on-set rant; but taken as a straight sci-fi action movie, it's pretty darn good!",1250640000,3,693,4.596774193548387
3578896,2,B001FB55I0,"Sam Worthington's portrayal of Marcus Wright is what really carries this movie and makes it worth watching until the end. Unfortunately, whomever created the trailers decided to spoil what would have been the most emotional storyline in a movie that has no other emotional pull.
And, thus by spoiling the movie's most interesting plot point, they robbed me of anything that would make me care for the characters.
As for the portrayal of John Connor, I'm a Christian Bale fan, but his performance doesn't tell us why people so revere John Connor. He's in slight Batman mode all the way throughout and we only believe the people revere him as some Jesus Christ-figure (J.C., get it?) because the Terminator tells us so.
This movie should have been about Marcus Wright, and John Connor only should have been seen in near-mystical ways, in the shadows, in blurs and such.
If the movie had focused on Marcus Wright, put him forth as the main character, the movie could have been onto great things.
Besides Worthington, the other good thing the movie has going for it are some great action set pieces.
This is worth watching for Worthington and the action scenes (especially the one on the highway), and hardcore Terminator fans should watch it, but it's not a necessary chapter, adding little to what we already know about the overarching storyline. It's really too bad because there was the potential to be something more, but it falls flat.
I hate to say it, but even the Star Wars prequels, as bad, mediocre and uneven as those were overall, they did a better of filling in the holes of a storyline most of us know very well.
Terminator: Salvation isn't anywhere nearly as bad as Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, but it's not a must-see, as it doesn't push the Terminator/John Connor story forward.",1249516800,7,1799,4.787781350482315

3578962,5,B001FB55I0,"Being a loyal fan of THE best terminator of the series (the first one) and having seen the sequels; I set my expectation levels very low for this one; particularly because of the PG-13 rating which reaked of pandering to the mainstream.

I have to say... I was shockingly surprised at how enjoyable this movie turned out to be. I don't have to mention how amazing the action sequences were but they were some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. While a few reviews mention the story and editing being choppy, I would have to agree only with the editing. The story linked the past sequels surprisingly well while at the same time creating an alternate future with a whole new subplot involving a whole new character. If you know your T- Series movies.. you know what I am talking about. Little touches throughout the movie added to the nastalgia such as the GNR moment, Arnold coming back (sort of) as the original terminator which looked so real. They literally took shots of the original movie to put arnold back in this movie so he looked just as he did in 1984. Even the scar on John Connor's face (which is in a future scene on T2) was added in the movie when he was scratched by the terminator. Little touches for fans like us made the movie that much more fun to watch.

I have to compliment the actors as well. I trully believed these characters would become the actors in the earlier movies especially Kyle Reese. Although, I found myself scratching my head with the little girl who added absolutely no value in the past sequels or this movie's story line.

This movie is a must see for T fans and new fans since it can also be watched as a stand alone movie. I was truly surprised at how much fun I had watching this movie, even though it's the first to tone it down with a PG 13 rating. I really wish they would have made it darker and grittier by making an R rating but it does rank as my second favorite in the series.",1248220800,6,1935,4.325068870523416
3578963,4,B001FB55I0,"As a fan of the entire Terminator movie series, you would be forgiven for assuming that I would hate this movie. The truth is that I didn't watch this movie hoping it would match the brilliance of the original movies as I knew that simply wasn't going to happen. What we got was not a film that captured the terrifying doomsday essence of what made Cameron's two Terminator films so brilliant. We also didn't even get the cool and slick looking destruction heavy style of the third Terminator film. What we got instead was, what I felt, to be a perfectly captured post-apocalyptic world which contains a marvellous depiction of the human race when faced with what seems as the impossible fight for survival. Director McG has received a lot of doubt about his ability move the Terminator saga into the post-apocalyptic world which we first gained a glimpse of in the first Terminator movie. That doubt had no foundation and what McG presented in the finished piece, although the plot could do with some polishing, was a fantastically frightening environment with some cool effects and worthy acting throughout.

The plot sets John Connor in the year 2018. The machine uprising has begun and only small pockets of human resistance movements exist with the soul purposes of surviving and destroying the machine threat. John Connor has finally entered the position he was fated to enter since before he was born and is now the leader of the human resistance. He has encountered the machines before which gives him and his teams the advantage when knowing what they will be put up against as the human/machine war continues. As the resistance fight continues Connors father, Kyle Reese encounters Marcus Wright who we see at the start of the movie receiving lethal injections on death row just before the war begins. Marcus doesn't know what's happened as he woke up in the post-apocalyptic world with no memory of the machine initial attempt at destroying the human race. Marcus quickly partners up with Kyle Reese and a child we know as Star who are also on a mission to find the resistance leader and join the fight. The mystery eventually unfolds and we find out whether Marcus was sent from the future or is merely a survivor of the past and he becomes pivotal in the fight against the machine threat.

The film itself was very touch and go throughout. Some parts worked where others didn't but the entire piece presented an enjoyable action movie that doesn't go too much into the fight for survival on the psychological end of things but does retain the aura of desperation that the humans feel in their fight. Christian Bale was surprisingly awful in this and I honestly expected more from a man taking the reigns of the legendary John Connor. Bale presented an ultimately one dimensional character and you had to question his motives of taking the role of this infamous movie character. The mysterious Marcus Wright character, played by the brilliant Sam Worthington is a movie saving character from start to finish. His whole performance is brilliant throughout and manages to drive the plot along successfully with very little to work with in terms of original character depth. Kyle Reese played by the brilliant up and comer Anton Yelchin is also a delightful addition to the movie and adds again a bit of depth to the movies plot. Other supporting cast include Moon Bloodgood as Blair Williams and Bryce Dallas Howard as Connor's wife Cate. Also, a cool little cameo piece goes to the delightful Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogan who is a Doctor for Cyberdyne Systems and actually turns out to have a more pivotal role.

The action is brilliant throughout and with the apparent unbeatable nature of the machines this manages to present quite a daunting aspect to the theatre of the battles that ensue. The scale of the machine warfare is quite disappointing as when we first glimpsed the human/machine war in the first movie, we gained a glimpse of what seemed to be a constantly chaotic battle which left us wanting more. This film doesn't use Cameron's image as McG takes away the futuristic lasers and hoards of machines lined up executing human after human and he exchanges it for the odd flying scouting machine, a large harvester robot which merely collects the humans for what seems to be mass slaughter and of course, the T-600 machines which are a less advanced model of the T-800 machine which we all know as the 101 machine or Arnold Schwarzenegger who we all miss from this movie. This is probably what the movie is lacking the most as the absence of Arnie is certainly a drag for the Terminator franchise and I'm sure that if the effort were put into the writing, they could have found a role for the older Arnold in this film.

There's not denying that Terminator Salvation lacks the charm and excitement of its trilogy of predecessors, however, there's a lot that this film brings to the Terminator universe. The possibility of John Connors son, the look at the early models of the Terminator machines and the new machine concepts make it quite enjoyable. Had the acting been a bit better and the supporting cast a higher level of significance, this film could have been on par with the original 3. It's still a good film and a worthwhile waste of just under two hours.",1248134400,10,5299,4.76278563656148
3578964,2,B001FB55I0,"I could (and often do) watch the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000OPOAM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;film many times and never grow tired of it, because at the time - 25 years ago - and well beyond that it was refreshingly new in concept, the special effects were fantastic and it offered a great mixture of drama, horror and science fiction in the one package. That Arnie couldn't act didn't matter; he was perfect as the relentlessly committed cyborg. A retrospective nod too for Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, he who not only travelled back in time from 2029 to stop the terminator but happened to father a child too - the one who would become the enigmatic John Connor, nemesis of terminator-makers Skynet and general saviour of the future of mankind. It was silly but it worked.

In SALVATION, which takes place in post-apocalyptic 2018, no time travel takes place and Christian Bale plays a slightly more youthful John Connor whose mission is to find Kyle Reese and send him back in time to become Connor's mother. Hmm. I could just about grab the idea, that this is kind of a prequel to the later year when Reese was actually sent back, but the notion that Connor's failure to find Reese wouldn't leave my consciousness; after all, if he didn't find him, then surely Connor wouldn't exist, so although it hasn't happened yet, it must do! Perhaps that's my logical mind working too hard to deconstruct the fantasy, but it does seem even more absurd than ever. On the other hand it does add weight to those who hold the belief that there is no such thing as a past and a future, that all times are in parallel with each other, that the future is just as much history as what has gone before.

But I digress. Before tracking Reese down, Connor comes across the human-cyborg hybrid Marcus, who at times looks vaguely like the love-child of Arnie and - well, another cyborg - and who offers Connor the way into Skynet where Reese can be found. Connor must decide whether Marcus has been sent from the future, or rescued from the past. As Skynet prepares its final onslaught, Connor and Marcus embark on an odyssey that takes them into the heart of Skynet's operations, where they uncover the terrible secret behind the possible annihilation of mankind. Faithful to Reese's prophecy in T1, the humans created machines which have evolved in such a way that they plan to destroy their makers.

This is awful, a very poor and sorry distant relative to the original with which it will inevitably be compared. Except there is no comparison - at least in T1 there was humanity in abundance, with everyone except the cyborg being vulnerable and with lives that we can relate to. As the franchise has developed (for want of a better word), that vital element of humanity has diminished and in this, the fourth offering, the machines have pretty much taken over completely. As a result it's difficult to care for anybody or anything, and for me that's a necessary emotion in film-making, that you care if somebody dies or not, or gets hurt or not. The overall impression is that not only will the machines have taken over the world in the future, but they've taken over Hollywood today. Christian Bale doesn't generate any charisma worthy of note, he just seems grumpy from start to finish and as with so many of his other films (such as Dark Knight, 3:10 to Yuma) he's given top billing but he's upstaged by someone else. If anything, he's best known for his tirade captured on Youtube in which he loses his temper with one of the camera crew. In the film, the cameras perform better than Bale.

The fundamental flaw is that we are made to believe that humans are good and machines are bad, but of course it was the humans who designed the machines in the first place so any evil created was of the human's own making. Again, that's logic obstructing fantasy but as with the brain-twisting philosophies of time travel I found it difficult to ignore. The film is also like a manufactured product in that it is devoid of heart, blood and soul. All it does is make a great deal of noise, making it perhaps the noisiest film ever made. Maybe it will appeal to a younger audience now that it no longer carries an R/18 rating, but for now all I can conclude is that those who enjoy it will be twelve years old and have no experience or even knowledge of the immeasurably superior original. Apparently this is the first of a second trilogy, but in my considered judgement this series should be terminated here and now.",1247616000,6,4598,4.74375

But then, as release time drew closer, trailers emerged that actually made us wonder whether their might be some life in the old T800 yet. One notorious sound-clip of a throwing-the-toys-from-the-pram onset moment later and the patient was ready to be released on an unsuspecting public.

And, once the bandages were off, we were left with a movie that is markedly different from its predecessors and frankly none the worse for it.

First off, cards on the table -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000OPOAM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-3-Rise-of-the-Machines-2-Disc-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM0B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;are my favourite films from the series.

I was not a fan of the way that Cameron softened the T800 or recycled the chase through refinery/factory ending of the first film. Also, in my humble opinion, T2 is too long and bloated for its own good.

T3, although panned by the majority of critics at the time of release, struck me as being far more of a return to the dark fatalism of the first instalment of the series as well as the ruthlessness of the original film's mechanical protagonist. The ending was also absolutely breath-taking and promised to move the series on from the standard ""chase through contemporary California"" shtick.

A more appropriate title for ""Terminator: Salvation"" may have been, ""Terminator: Year One"" as essentially this is what you have here. The Year is 2018, a scant fifteen years since ""Judgement Day"", and it would seem that both Skynet and The Resistance are still largely in their embryonic stages and are locked in a stalemate over territory. John Connor (Christian Bale) is, at this time, essentially a grunt in the Tec-Com forces who is resented by the resistance command and control structure for his wilfulness, savvy and lack of respect for the upper echelons of command. During a mission to destroy a Skynet installation, Connor unwittingly releases Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a death-row prisoner who was reprieved from execution, prior to judgement day, after agreeing to donate his body to a certain company known as Cyberdyne systems...

In isolation, Connor and a befuddled Wright, who finds himself staggering through the unfamiliar world of a post-apocalyptic Earth, slowly begin to piece together a conspiracy which will have devastating consequences for all involved.

To reveal more of the plot would be to ruin one of the more enjoyable thrill-rides of 2009. While it's true to say that the film is not without faults (one wonders where the female resistance fighters get their make-up and haircare products; how a helicopter is actually capable of out-running a Nuclear explosion and whether two children would really be able to eke out an existence in a city which had suffered multiple ICBM strikes only 15 years earlier), if you can overlook them, you're treated to a rather splendid ""cloak and dagger"" plot that brings to mind Brian G. Hutton's awesome 1968 thriller,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-Eagles-Dare/dp/B0007TKNME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where Eagles Dare</a>. True, you may see some of the twists coming, but, personally, this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the film and only served to make the villainy of Skynet even more insidious and calculating.

On the whole, performances are good. Bale makes a perfectly serviceable war-grizzled Connor and he is equally matched by Sam Worthington's hard-bitten Wright who shares probably the same amount of screen-time. Although it's true that Bryce-Dallas Howard is somewhat underused as Kate Brewster, it strikes me that this is the first film in a new phase of the series and I suspect she will come to the fore if and when this new take on an old standard is allowed to progress.

McG as a director, thankfully, keeps it old-school and chooses not to employ the irritating hyper-kinetic CGI/shakey-camism so beloved of action directors such as the Wachowskis and Paul Greengrass. It really was refreshing to be able to see what was going on in a shot for a change.

My advice - rent before you buy if T2 was more your thing. I suspect that if you're a fan of the sneakier, more ruthless Skynet of first film though, then you're going to enjoy this sequel.

Definitely a film that I'll be adding to my DVD collection in time.",1246233600,14,6097,6.144366197183099
3579025,4,B001FB55I0,"Having loved the first 2 Terminators, and hating the 3rd, I was really expecting this to be a hard flop knowing that none of the original cast would be in this one, and it was going to be set in the future during the wars.

Well, I was quite surprised to have really enjoyed this film and can honestly say, it's not made like T1 or T2, but it sticks out on it's own as a new vision of the Terminator story.

The plot evolves around more then 1 character in this. One being John Conner played by Christian Bale, who learns of machines plot to try and kill his father Kyle Reese before he can be sent back in time to become Conner's father, and he also learns the machines have captured Kyle and it's now his job to rescue him. The other is around that other guy on the poster, someone who was a murderer who upon his execution, signed his body over to science for an experimentation. But he wants to destroy cyberdine too.

Basically everyone just wants to destroy that place, so there is a lot of action and explosions in between, but I find them highly enjoyable.

You get to see how the war is taking place between Man and Machine. The weapons in the future can take out Terminators now, so they are easily killed, but with so many of them, it's hard to take out all of them.

The best part of the movie to me was the truck chase as whats-his-face and Kyle try to escape in a toe-truck while being hunted by motorbike terminators. The scene is well put together and the handling the terminators show is pretty well thought out. It reminded me a lot of old school movie car chases, where it looked real, and not made with CGI (apart from the bikes) and it had this feeling of Mad Max on steroids. Also they have a lot of small tributes to the previous Terminator movies. There are scenes with bikes and cars flying off bridges to remind you of the bike scene in T2: Judgment Day. As well as other little things along the way.

There was a few things I didn't get tho... but by the end of the film, I was hanging out to see the next installment. I even was about to check out ""The Terminators"" but after the trailer to that, even this movie couldn't make me watch that.

So, don't go in expecting to see something like T1 or T2, and like most of us, forget T3 ever existed. And sit back and enjoy an action movie of Man Vs Machine. And take no note of the idiots saying this movie is bad because of this and that... see it for yourself and don't be fooled by the smaller majority of viewers who hate it because James Cameron and Arnie aren't in it... actually, he sort of is. Let those people complain for a refund and they can go off and watch the Hanna Montanna Movie if they believe this is going to be the worst blockbuster of 2009.",1246147200,8,2736,4.190114068441065
3579026,3,B001FB55I0,"The fourth entry of the franchise ""Terminator Salvation"" is, like some of the recent Hollywood blockbuster films, heavy on action, and light on story and characters. There are lots of actions, and while I admit most of them are more than satisfactory, greatly helped by the latest CG technology, I am very disappointed with the film's dull story. Having recently seen James Cameron's terrific ""Judgment Day,"" I couldn't help feeling that after all the best part of the whole ""Terminator"" series is behind us.

The newest ""Terminator"" film is set in the year 2018. John Conner is back, played by Christian Bale, as a resistance group leader in the post-apocalypse war against the deadly robots created by Skynet computer system. I won't repeat here what happened in the previous three ""Terminator"" films (I haven't seen the TV series) because most people remember (I hope) the basic storyline of the series. John Conner is to save the human species; to save him you have to save young, inexperienced Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who is to go back through time and be John's father.

""Terminator Salvation"" (credited writers, John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris) heavily relies on this logic - Kyle must be saved. The logic is correct, but fails to engage on any emotional level. Despite very intense acting from Christian Bale, the character of John Conner looks so flat. A new character is introduced, one Marcus Wright (impressive Sam Worthington, to be seen in James Cameron's ""Avatar""). He first appears in death row (with the ailing doctor played by Helena Bonham Carter) in the brief introductory, pre-apocalypse sequence, and he plays a key role in the subsequent scenes, it is certain, but the ""mystery"" surrounding him is not very interesting.

Bryce Dallas Howard, Moon Bloodgood, and veteran Jane Alexander appear, but unlike the strong female characters James Cameron likes to depict (like Linda Hamilton), none of the characters they play is memorable. The film also includes some nods to the previous ""Terminator"" films, most notably, one Guns 'N Roses song and the ""I'll be back"" line, which may make you cringe.

To his credit, director McG (""Charlie's Angels"") handles the action sequences competently though the actions themselves sometimes look over-the-top and ridiculously exaggerated. Another merit is the effective cinematography of Shane Hurlbut, which captures the gloomy atmosphere of the bleak world destroyed by the massive nuclear war. ""Terminator Salvation"" is an enjoyable ride though you may forget it the moment you leave the theater.",1246060800,,2565,5.188405797101449
3579027,2,B001FB55I0,"It's funny how for years Terminator fans have been arguing over which of the first two films is the best.  Now they can argue over which of the last two films is the worst!

Christian Bale is the third incarnation of the character John Connor and people are pointing out that it isn't his best performance.  In my judgement he's a step above the last person who was John Connor but he's still too one dimensional for my tastes.  Ironically though, the most interesting part of Christian Bale's involvement in the character was the disturbing and strangely funny outburst he had off screen with one of the directors while they were filming a scene.  As I watched Salvation I found myself wondering which scene they were filming when Bale went ballistic.  I really want to know.

On the plot, it is frustrating how in this fourth Terminator movie John Connor is STILL trying to save his own existence.  Apparently, Skynet knows Kyle Reese is the future father of John Connor but how in the world do they know this?  They try to terminate Kyle because I guess since their attempt to kill John's mother didn't work they figured they would try to kill his father this time?  Then why didn't the T-800 from the first terminator movie also try to kill Kyle as well?  Or better yet why did Skynet even send back a terminator machine to 1984 since the threat from the machine is what gets Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor together? I'm not sure if I can wrap my head around this.  Bottom line is they're just going through the same old idea and it doesn't even make sense this time.  I would have to say that my least favorite character in the whole Terminator franchise is John Connor because his importance has been shoved down my throat too many times.  When is he going to do something useful?

The character Marcus is getting a lot of praise and, rather than repeating what has been said, I'll just say that Sam Worthington does give a worthy performance.

Besides this there are two brief cameos that should be mentioned.  Linda Hamilton is in the movie (sort of) as John listens to her old audio recordings that she started at the end of the first terminator movie.  But did anyone else notice that she sounds way too old?  At the time of the recordings she's supposed to be twentyish but she sounds like 50.

The best thing about the movie was the too brief confrontation between Arnold Schwartzenegger (how he looked from the first terminator movie) and John Connor as he tries to rescue his dad from being terminated.  I read that some people didn't like this CGI Arnold but I thought it looked really good.  Does it make it worth seeing in the theatre or buying it on DVD?  I doubt it.  Just find that scene on youtube and favorite it.",1245888000,2,2732,4.5060975609756095
3579028,4,B001FB55I0,"The beginning was really slow, and the action didn't really kick in until a giant robot was harvesting people for the terminator experiments by Skynet. I did like the way they worked in tiny details from the previous terminator movies, like the GNR song John Connor listened to when he was a kid, or Connor saying, ""I'll be back.""

I thought they did a pretty good job with the CGI of Arnold's face, but that was towards the end of the movie. Although there wasn't much interaction between John Connor and Kyle Reese, it was interesting to see how Reese got involved with the resistance.

The story mainly centered on a proto-type terminator programmed to think it's human, but saying anything more would be a major spoiler.

It wasn't a bad story, but I expected more action from a Terminator movie. Also, the way this movie ends, they will still have to do a 5th sequel because we don't see the Arnold terminator reprogrammed, we don't see Reese get sent back, and Skynet is still running the world.

This is what I expected from this film, a sort of a prequel and a sequel that sets up the events of the apocalypse, of the Skynet fallout.  What's not to like here?

3579030,3,B001FB55I0,"I'm a huge fan of the Terminator series and I saw this movie on the midnight premier when it was released in theaters! I loved the movie, it's something I was wanting to see for a long time, a movie about the future war against skynet. Christian Bale did a great John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright was great too! The movie stayed very true to the previous 3 movies and stuck to the time line way better then T3 did.... When I entered the movie theater, I didn't have any great expectations though, because I'm not a fan of Mc G's previous movies and didn't really think he could pull it off, but he did it. There's been a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but trust me, if you are a true Terminator fan, you are going to love this movie! The action scenes are great, the plot is familiar and also has a little something that feels new and fresh. The actors / actresses did a great job in their rolls and the machines were amazing!
I personally think this is the best Terminator movie since T2 and I give the movie 5 stars out of 5, but now to the DVD review.....

The DVD I give 2 stars for this reason:
Mc G promised the fans that when TS was going to be released on DVD and Blu Ray that the fans would get a 30-40 minute longer version along with an alternate ending and also a bunch of bonus material! Now when the time is here for the DVD and Blu Ray to be released we can clearly see that Mc G's words weren't true, for now at least.... the DVD does not contain anything, but the theatrical version and there is no bonus material at all!
The Blu Ray contains the so called ""directors cut"" of the movie which is only 3 minutes longer along with the bonus features and a theatrical version!! WTF happened to the 30-40 mintute longer version for BOTH DVD AND BLU RAY??? WTF happened to the bonus features for the DVD version??? 2009 will be remembered as the year that the Terminator fans got screwed!! Our TV Show got canceled and now our long awaited DVD release of TS is nothing of what we were promised!!
I am going to boycott this release and I think all of the true Terminator fans should do it as well, so that we can show the movie company that we ain't gonna take their lies... I hope they release the promised version of Terminator Salvation, AND NOT JUST FOR BLU RAY, BUT FOR DVD AND BLU RAY!!! NOT EVERYBODY OUT THERE HAS BLU RAY AND YOU MOVIE COMPANY'S NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT!!

I love the movie, but as long as the movie doesn't get released as promised, I will not pay any more money for this movie!

3579031,3,B001FB55I0,"It's not easy to review a film like TERMINATOR SALVATION.  It's one of those movies that pretty much requires that you've seen the movies that came before, and certainly it helps if you liked or loved the earlier TERMINATOR saga.

I would say right off that bat that if you were lukewarm or worse about prior TERMINATORs...there is no reason to bother with SALVATION.  It will not change your mind, unless you have a Christian Bale fixation, I guess.  The film, which does have some strengths, will in no way change the mind of a doubter.

I'm a pretty big fan of the original trilogy, but not exactly a fan-boy either.  I don't parse every action and I sure don't spend a great deal of time working out the time-travel inconsistencies.  There are some in this film, just as one could argue there are in all the others.  To me, it all boils down to whether a nearly all-powerful computer can also somehow see into the future.  Whatever...I choose to go with it.

The original TERMINATOR, however dated the effects are now, is still a superlative sci-fi action film, with a near perfect mix of action, sci-fi ""stuff"", humor and romance.  Michael Biehn made a great Reese, the hero sent from the future to save Sarah Connor, the destined-to-be-the-mother of John Connor, the human who will defeat Skynet, the aforementioned supercomputer.  Arnold Schwartzeneggar is the Terminator sent by Skynet from the future to kill Sarah (Linda Hamilton).  Arnold (Schwartzeneggar is simply too long to type over and over!) created his signature role, a part that fit his limited skills and his assets perfectly.  Odd inflections worked for this robot covered in skin.  A super-buff body also worked perfectly.  It was an original and thoroughly enjoyable minor sci-fi masterpiece.

TERMINATOR 2 was a major sci-fi masterpiece.  Not only did it introduce CGI to an astounded world, but it was one of the most thrilling action movies of all time...with a brainy plot, great action sequences, and a breathtaking performance from Linda Hamilton.  She is still (along with Ripley from ALIEN, et. al.) THE great female action character.  Arnold was a ""nice"" robot now, and he pulled off the part with near perfection.  As limited as the man is as an actor, this role was crafted perfectly to him...and making him a hero also made him immensely appealing.  This is a movie that even to this day, I can watch about every 2 years or so and still enjoy the heck out of.

TERMINATOR 3 shows the now nearly adult John Connor running from a new Terminator, with the assistance of a new Arnold.  I know a lot of people really dislike the film, and it DOES feel moldy compared to the 2nd film.  There's nothing too earthshattering to say with this film...yet I still enjoyed.  There's a great car chase, featuring a fire truck.  There's some important new things to learn about how Skynet ""becomes aware.""  Arnold and Nick Stahl have some good scenes together, and even shiny-skinned Claire Danes is sympathetic and enjoyable.  While the movie suffers in comparison to what came before, I still enjoyed it.

Now, many years later, SALVATION comes along.  Some time has passed since Judgement Day, and now the human survivors are clinging to life amid the rubble of civilization.  John Connor (Bale) is emerging a strong resistance leader, although not yet clearly the ""savior"" of mankind.  He becomes aware that Skynet is out to get not only him, but young Reese (Anton Yelchin) as well, thus killing the boy who is soon to grow up to become his father.  (Again, how does the computer know this BEFORE it has even happened?)  As Connor works to find  Reese and also a way to destroy Skynet...Reese is a somewhat incompetent resistance fighter living in ""downtown"" LA.  He meets up with Marcus Wright (newcomer Sam Worthington), a man who is not all he thinks he is.  (I won't say anymore about Wright's character...he's by far the most interesting and complex creation in this film.)  Wright & Reese eventually join Connor, and they may join forces to fight Skynet.

The film features many fantastic visuals and some nicely staged action sequences.  The movie was filmed in the deserts of New Mexico (including one car chase that was filmed less than half a mile from some land I'm building a house on!!), and the bleached filmstock used to capture the dryness of the desert gives the whole film an appropriately desolate feel.  It's the best post-apocalyptic landscape since THE ROAD WARRIOR.  Actions fans should enjoy the fun explosions set against such a bleak and lovely landscape.

Fans of character development and good acting will be left wanting.  I've never been a big fan of Bale (except perhaps in AMERICAN PSYCHO).  His Batman/Bruce Wayne leaves me very, very cold.  To me he just seems smarmy...and I'm very tired of his gravelly voice.  He doesn't give a performance in this film, as much as  he tries to assert his presence.  ""Look, it's me...I'm charismatic,"" seems to be his attitude.  Sam Worthington is far more interesting as Marcus Wright, and his scenes are the best, without a doubt...yet even he bounces from American to Australian accents without a care in the world.  Anton Yelchin is far too lightweight for me to believe he will grow up to be the tough, sinewy Reese of the original TERMINATOR.  Dallas Bryce Howard looks great (those eyes!) as Connor's wife, but has nothing to do.  Helena Bonham Carter looks bored.  Jane Alexander looks dewy-eyed and bored.  Michael Ironsides (one of the greatest names for an actor ever!) is his usual monotone self.

The film simply fails to generate real suspense.  It has moments of sound and fury...but the story has no compelling arch and leaves no feeling of anticipation to see what  happens next.  We seldom worry for a character...and we should be worried, because circumstances are bleak.

When the movie was over, I had not one single glimmering of ""can't wait for the next one,"" even though it's clear they plan to make another sequel (or two, I've heard).

It's not a dreadful movie, but where the first 2 TERMINATORs broke new ground in their genre, SALVATION feels like a half-hearted creative effort, at best.

(PS:  You may have heard that Arnold makes an appearance.  Let me just say that if you've seen Patrick Stewart in WOLVERINE or know what the makers of GLADIATOR did with Oliver Reed after his death, then you get some idea of the value of Arnold's ""appearance"" here.)",1245110400,,6432,4.7996357012750455

I like how John Connor finally become a real man away from the punk in T2 and T3. It is also interesting to see that John Connor become a prophet in this movie.  This movie is more story-driven with great action and visual.  The story is deeper and darker than the previous movies.  The visual is awesome!  It looks so real.  5 stars from me.,1244937600,4,460,3.978021978021978
3579033,5,B001FB55I0,"Some spoilers follow...

I really expected a bad movie considering it was ""Charlie's Angels"" McG at the helm, but it actually had the same ""B"" movie feeling the other three had...he could use a little help in the story editing department (the flow was a little clunky here and there...almost like stuff was missing), but the script seemed solid enough to me. Like most movies these days, I'm sure there is a great deal of footage on the floor so to speak, that could end up being an extended version of this that could possibly clarify things a bit.

The production was outstanding...this will a great demo disc on BR, especially with the sound design...very layered and intense. The special effects were great and everything from sets to make-up to costumes and photography was a step up from the earlier films, giving it an epic feel. It has a gritty look to the action that suits the setting and story perfectly. The physical action were really well done...again, adding an intense realism to the movie without being over the top.  Stand-outs include the sensational ""Harvester"" chase scene and both times Conner is in a chopper...watch out!

Another surprise here is the choice of Danny Elfman, and his score sounds quite good...a little too reminiscent of his work on Marky Mark's Ape flick maybe, but it still works none the less....he gives the music a more traditional orchestral sound opposed to the over-use of synthesizers that many action films rely on these days. It was cool to hear Fidel's main motif pop in once in a while at just the right times. There's an interesting recurring motif for the Marcus character that reminds me of Ron Grainer's work on ""The Omega Man"", further adding to that cool `70's apocalyptic vibe that parts of this movie has.

Now the cast...as mentioned by many other reviews, this is definitely Sam Worthington's show...the story invests a lot of time in Marcus' journey through the film an it helps that Worthington does a really good job with his physical performance (especially with those little nods to Arnold's ""stillness"" along the way) and he comes across well acting-wise too. I found his struggle with what he really was provided the most poignant moments in the movie...a man trapped in a new existence as a Terminator, fighting to stay connected with his flawed humanity and looking for some kind of redemption for his own past and ending up providing a ""salvation"" for the resistance and it's new leader....cool stuff and an interesting twist on the whole ""Terminator"" story.

Bale was almost a supporting actor in this thing...he was competent, but not outstanding. Again, his role could have been sabotaged by the script and the editing as much as anything... Compared to Marcus, Bale's John Conner seemed a little one-note with his performance throughout the film. Could be considered the nature of his character here but... There were some cool moments with him though, like when he pops on that GnR tune before capturing the MotoTerminator that brought back memories of the Connor character's motorbike stunts in T2. I also liked that it was pretty clear that not everyone in the resistance (most notably the higher-ups) though he was ""all that"", but the grunts in the trenches did...gave him an everyman appeal that was pretty cool.

Another show-stealer was Anton Yelchin as Kyle Reese...this young man is proving to be quite the chameleon as an actor this summer, first in ""Star Trek"" as the precocious boy-genius Chekov and now here he is almost literally channeling Michael Biehn (right down to talking through clenched teeth) as the young resistance fighter Reese.

Both of the female characters are a little short-shifted here, but both Howard and Bloodgood do a good job in the brief scenes they have.

Like the recent ""Star Trek"" picture, this one had a lot of visual nods (and some obvious lines) to the earlier films, from the cool opening credits looking similar to the ones the first film to a lot of physical gags from other movies as well, especially with Marcus. The action sequences were well-staged and packed some punch. And yes, the Arnold cameo featured some excellent work from ILM...very well integrated both visually and in the story....very cool. The ending? Well, I'll just leave it at...I like what the film presented way better than the ""leaked"" one....yeah, maybe it seemed a little sappy to some, but I though it fit well.

The main thing that really shines though in this movie for me is that it really looks like an effort by folks that really cared about the Terminator saga and wanted to do a great job. As with any of these ""franchise"" movies, there are always fans who disagree with the approach taken with the film or story elements or casting choices or whatever. But it works great for me...I hope this movie finds a big, receptive audience on DVD and Blu-Ray...

But...if this ends up being the end of the line for the Terminator saga (and the slowing domestic BO suggests it might be)...it's a good one, but I'm game for more...",1244851200,19,5030,4.830429732868757
3579034,4,B001FB55I0,"After watching this 4th of the Terminator series, it is clear to me that James Cameron was the key reason behind the Terminator series's success. McG, the director of this film, seems to be gifted in action sequences but rather poor in editing.

Everyone knows that very few films will ever measure up to the first two Terminator films. The 2nd Terminator (Judgement Day) still ranks as one of the greatest action movies of all time and the 1st Terminator does not rank too far behind. This is an entertaining film which will unfortunately forever be compared to the first 2 films. This film falls short of the first two.

The best portion of this film are the action sequences. The Mad Max like thrilling action sequences are breathtaking. This Terminator film brings back much of the old school special effects using real stuntman (not CGI) to perform very dangerous yet entertaining stunts.

The film suffers from a noticeably bad editing. The sequences do not flow well in many scenes. For example, the scenary between the Blair Williams and the thugs are shown abruptly right after Marcus Wright and Blair developes a romantic chemistry. The scene which a human prisoner is shot by a T-600 is best described as choppy.  You will notice more than few sequences in which few hours of filming seemed to have been condensed into few seconds.

The storyline is also very choppy as well. It appears Dr. Serena Kogan's role has been changed many times. That's too bad since I think Serena's role could have been a pivtol and a fascinating one. Perhaps Marcus Wright's original role has been altered more than a few times. The storyline is not entirely coherent.

Moon Bloodgood, who plays Blair Williams, was the most convincing actor. Sam Worthington has proven himself to be a bonifide action star. And Christian Bale has done nothing to derail his action star status.

Perhaps the director McG tried too hard to condense this film into under 2 hours. I think the film would have benefited from another 15-25 minutes and a more consistent storyline.

Lastly, I think this Terminator film does not portray the post Judgement Day human suffering well at all. Where are the starving and wretched human existence? Does John Connor's greatness reside primarily in his knowledge of the Skynet and the Terminators?",1244764800,38,2307,4.86734693877551

""T1"" and ""T2"" were great movies that told a complete story, and this feels like an excuse to make more money.  Bale steps into the role of Connor, and gets the job done, but the performance is nothing spectacular.  Director McG has some tricks up his sleeve, including a helicopter crash that is filmed interestingly, but is unimpressive overall.  The biggest delight perhaps is the appearance of a former terminator 2/3 of the way through the film.  Overall, I got what I expected here; the problem was that I wasn't expecting much.",1244419200,,1161,4.76

Terminator 3 crippled the franchise, but what could possibly make you squirm about the idea of another terminator movie. Let me see... how about the news that the director of Charlie's Angels is taking charge.

And that is exactly how this movie plays out. A blockbustre action movie with lots of physical stunts, no one being terribly hurt and safe viewing for the masses. Enjoyable yeh, but not true to the adult viewing of the original Terminator concept.

Lets face it, the franchise itself has just been a rehash of the same story everytime. Good guy Vs bad guy go back in time to kill\save protagonist. This was fine but in terminator 3 the scene for scene rehash of film dynamics just went too far.

And this is exactly the problem here, it tries so hard to shove nostalgia down our throats with cheesy dialogue like 'Ill be back' and 'Come with me if you want to live'. Not realizing that the real way to excite fans is to stay true to the raw, gritty and unrelenting action of the original film. I mean this was once a film for adults.

Terminator salvatino was suppose to be the answer to a ridiculously thrashed idea, but even under these circumstances we are thrown into the same tailspin dynamics of the original creation. Good guy bad guy save\kill protagonist. Only this time Salvatino rips off scenes from Mad Max, War of the Worlds, Ghost in the Shell and manages to lose itself.

Yeh all the iconic moments are in this movie... T600, the thundering ""da da da da daaaa ... da da da da daaaa"" music, the melting lava (cant forget the lava), the torn face\red eye, and the post apocalptic war.... but why did I feel like I was watching a Resident Evil film or something.

Maybe it was the lack of attention to detail... the special effects inferior to T2. Maybe the accessorizing. What was up with the T600 with the red bandana and ear ring. WTF. Do these machines like to accessorize?!? which begs the real question, WTF is up with these things. Were they programmed to kill humans by throwing them around. Cause that is all they did the entire film. T800 was the same, but even slower. Far from the horror they could once inflict.

Terminator: Salvatino is a branching saga stemming from the trilogy. And if exposition is what you are after then you will appreciate this offshoot direction for this reason alone. Its totally unnecessary if we were a little less consuming of something probably better left unexplored. Matrix revolutions anyone?

But even then we get tied up in a someone else's story which took away from John Connor's, who we are made to believe is important. But we haven't seen why yet. His story is reduced to him trying to save his own a$$ the entire film because his mum told him he was the messiah. Right up till the last scene, he doesnt flinch at the thought of taking someone else's life for his own. Christian Bale is a fine actor, but he had nothing to work with here, which is a shame.

Finally I want to know why there is a desire every time to sugar coat a movie with a child. Is it suppose to symbolize humanity, give it a warmer feeling. What... what is it... that we have to be bogged down with a 5 year old child. We know the child is going to live. There is no archline to explore. So what is it?",1244332800,4,3260,4.4455611390284755

We get those are classics and its going to be hard to top them but on its own salvation is a very solid action packed movie. I just read an article saying the movies bombing because it cost 200 million to make. Well lets see its not g really going to bomb because you have overseas box office plus dvd and blu ray sales so. Now back to the real topic it was a good movie everyone i went to see it with liked it even my dad and hes hard to please so take my advice go see it youll like it.

I could hardly wait to see what's been done with the Terminator character and its story line. Sadly, this movie was such a shrieking, ear-drum busting mess I tuned out with the first thirty minuts.

Christian Bale proves that not even his star power can salvage his title character. The only performer who made everyone perk up was Sam Worthington. Wow, this guy has made it to the big time. He's tough, cute, charaismatic, quiet and exudes star attitude. This should end the franchise but that's Hollywood for you.

3579070,2,B001FB55I0,"There is a lot wrong with ""Terminator Salvation"". So much in fact that it may turn out to be one of the most disappointing films of Summer 2009.

If you take a look at the posters or promotional materials for the film you will notice two names listed above the title. The first is Christian Bale who plays John Connor. The film is set in 2018, just after Judgement Day and a ragtag group of humans are fighting to stay alive and battle SkyNet and their terminators. The second is Sam Worthington. Sam who? In Present Day, he plays Marcus a condemned criminal who wills his body for scientific experiments. When he wakes up, it is 2018 and the world is a very different place. ""Terminator Salvation"" basically tells two different stories; the story of John Connor and his fight to get to SkyNet and stop them from taking a lot of humans in for experiments and the story of Marcus as he quickly realizes he is in a different time and place and needs to try to save some innocent humans from these vicious machines. He eventually meets a young man named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin, ""Star Trek"", ""Alpha Dog"") and tries to keep him alive. Eventually, late in the film, the two stories mesh. But at this point, it's too late and the two separate stories, the two separate characters seem forced together.

This is not one of Christian Bale's best performances. He is so lifeless, so lacking of emotion that I wonder what he was trying to do with his portrayal of John Connor. Yes, I realize the world is a very difficult place and Connor has a lot of weight on his shoulders, but he never seems to be far from a grimace or a scowl. He is a determined man, but he never shows an emotion except for anger so we don't get a lot of feeling for who his character is. I found most of my emotion for this character came from my memories of John Connor in the second film. Because of this, it is difficult to care for him.

At one point, he listens to a series of tapes his mother left him. This is interesting, but we immediately sense he has heard these tapes many times before and is merely trying to scan through them, trying to find information about the events unfolding before him. He simply states, ""She doesn't make any mention of it."" So what is the point of this sequence to begin with? And it doesn't reveal any emotion for his character. He doesn't seem effected in the slightest by the thought of hearing his mom's voice again. No, John Connor doesn't have time for emotion. He has to keep moving. He has to keep working towards the goal.

John is also very gung ho to do just about anything. He knows his destiny and doesn't hesitate to volunteer for any mission, no matter how dangerous. But because there is never any hesitation, there is never any doubt and there is never any suspense. Unfortunately, the character doesn't work and as he is the centerpiece of the story, the film doesn't work.

Sam Worthington is more interesting but only because he is more confused. He basically wakes up in 2018. After he quickly realizes what is going on, and sees some evidence of what is going on, he realizes what he needs to do. In a way, this is also attributed to atonement for his previous life as a murderer. As soon as he realizes the humans are battling for their lives, he starts to help them and finds a group of people hiding out. One of these people is Kyle Reese.

I think McG, the director of this ""Terminator"" reboot, thinks merely mentioning the character makes him interesting and compelling. When we see a young Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, our interest is piqued, but the film has to work to maintain this interest. The filmmaker gets a temporary pass because he is able to work the character into the new film, but he has to work to earn this pass or we take it away. I don't think Reese has more than two lines in the entire film and most of the time, we only see him in the distance, as whatever vehicle he is imprisoned in takes off, dozens of other people crowded in around him.

There are many questions left unanswered in ""Salvation"". Why does Marcus go to such great lengths to protect Reese? How does he even now of the young man's importance? Or is he simply protecting him because he is protecting as many humans as he can? These questions and many others are left to our imagination, or perhaps they will be answered in the planned sequel.

McG went to a lot of trouble to convince Christina Bale to appear in the film. ""Take a chance on me"" is a quote I read in one story about the film and it's director. Bale may have been better served to deny the filmmaker. McG, who previously directed ""Charlie's Angels"" and its less interesting sequel, and is the producer on many television projects, (including ""Prison Break"" and the underrated ""Chuck"") is simply not the right director for the job. Sure, he loves the whiz-bang action scenes and loves playing with his toy box full of special effects, but all of his attention is spent on these areas. For an action film to be memorable, we have to care about the characters. We have to give two hoots about what happens to them. Somehow, the filmmakers have to make us feel for the characters. When we feel for them, we care about whether they make it through or not. When this happens, the film becomes suspenseful. Without it, we are merely watching a lot of stuff blow up on screen.

McG really does nothing with the John Connor character except to move the focus away from him for a good portion of the film. When we do spend time with Connor, we see a woman (Bryce Dallas Howard, ""The Village""< ""Lady in the Water"") approach him and try to comfort him. Is she his wife? His partner? Don't know and since McG doesn't seem to care, I can't either. There is a scene much later in the film when a group of people is about to be killed. They know they are about to be killed. They don't seem to care that they are going to be killed. When they are killed? Nothing because we don't care for them. At all. We aren't given the time or the information to care about them. I think McG feels that the mere mention of Kyle Reese's name will be enough to carry the character because that is basically all that happens to him. Jane Alexander plays a survivor who seems to be the matriarch for a small group of humans. But she literally has five minutes of screen time before she pops up in a few crowd scenes later in the film. It seems like a waste of character and a great actress.

A lot of time and attention (relatively anyway) is spent on developing Marcus' character and making him a part of the mythology. I really think McG wanted to put his stamp on the story and add his own creation to the film. Marcus is the most interesting character in the film and Worthington brings a quiet, Clint Eastwood like quality to the role, but really all this does is divert our attention away from Connor, who should be the focus of the story.

McG would be well served to turn to James Cameron for his inspiration. Not the ""Terminator"" films Cameron directed, although they are far superior to this new entry, but to how Cameron put his stamp on ""Aliens"". ""Alien"", directed by Ridley Scott, is a scary, haunted house-on-a-spaceship story. For the sequel, Cameron was called in. Rather than simply recreate the original, he took three elements from the first film; Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the Alien and a dark, wet spaceship floating through outer space. But he added to each of these. He gave Ripley a shell of toughness, which we didn't necessarily know she had before, and a maternal instinct that made her more interesting and vulnerable. He gave the Alien a maternal instinct as well, amping the danger level by making more Aliens. And he made the spaceship larger and more cavernous. He also added a ragtag group of mercenaries sent to the ship to help Ripley fight these aliens. The result? A film that is at least the equal of the original. McG takes various elements from the previous films, but doesn't do anything with them. The result? A film that is better than ""Terminator 3"", but just.

Ultimately, ""Terminator Salvation"" just seems like a pointless waste of time and film. Thankfully, Bale has one more Batman film to do.",1244246400,5,8204,4.454727030625833
3579071,4,B001FB55I0,"""Terminator Salvation"" is the latest film in the famous science fiction series launched by famous director James Cameron and his then-wife, producer Gail-Anne Hurd. This is the third sequel, and a worthy successor to the original film. The films depict a future where machines have become self-aware and have almost completely annihilated mankind, except for a scattered band of humans known as the Resistance.

This version takes place in 2018, and John Connor, one of the primary leaders of the resistance, is trying to find Kyle Reese, the then-teenager who will grow up to be his father (if you are confused, you'll need to see the first film). The movie brings together Connor (played by Christian Bale), Reese (plated by Anton Yelchin), Reese's pint-size ward, Star (Jadagrace Berry), Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a convicted murder in the present day who finds himself on the run from the machines, and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), a Resistance pilot rescued by Marcus.

The action is intense and at times, relentless, but it doesn't detract from an interesting story that questions how difficult it could be to maintain one's humanity while at war with non-human enemies. The film is enjoyable and doesn't take away from a series that has produced some of the most entertaining and thought-provoking science fiction films in motion-picture history.",1244246400,2,1364,5.223744292237443
3579072,4,B001FB55I0,"This is a darker and serious film than the rest of the pack. It has some vague similarities to the matrix and robocop and the overall ambiance is very mad max like. Nevertheless it is a good movie that follows the storyline pretty well. The sfx are excellent with no noticeable cgi (it is there but it does not stand out which is a good thing). I still prefer T2 out of the series, but no disappointments here.",1243900800,3,410,4.269230769230769
3579073,4,B001FB55I0,"The film opened a little on the muddy side. A convicted murderer is signing his corpse away to a dying woman representing Skynet.
Huh?
From there it goes uphill in a grim and unrelentingly violent way, if ""uphill"" is really an accurate description.
Despite all the fighting, explosions, gunfire and murdering terminators the core of this film defies the standard blockbuster. Many viewers appear to be disappointed that Christian Bale isn't a bigger personality on screen. I think he's perfect for the role because his charisma is not so much in your face but that of a determined man who, through his actions and evident intellect, earns the respect of the other field soldiers. He's like a grimacing dead man who holds THE secret. Sam Worthington's character is the reluctant heart of the film. He's the human being seemingly in spite of himself.

Going into this film I decided to lower my expectations to stave off any serious disappointment.
That attitude seemed warranted but I slowly found myself enjoying the film, appreciating the story as it unfolded. This film shows remaining humanity from a diverse perspective even as bleak as life is. From those fighting the good fight but being beaten down by the unrelenting machines (some hanging on by their fingernails against all odds) to self-exiled scavengers and even a few genuine miscreants, living on the edge of humanity, all are bent on surviving by their wits (or what little they have).
This can also be seen as a coming of age film as Conner discovers that trust in other humans may be the key to all their salvation, hence the title of the film. That trust was earned the hard way and there was still considerable reluctance. Desperate times....

What's refreshing is that the film doesn't rely too much on Bale to carry the film. Bale clearly sublimates his star status to be a fictional but also more realistic icon, a catalyst for hope without being the sole focus of the story. That was a smart move on the part of the director even if it pretty much eliminates any chance of this being a summer hit. Instead it's a good film with a good story, better than average acting and a solid re-establishing effort to bring the series back to square one, and actually before square one. The supporting cast was pretty impressive. The FX are very good, somewhat overwhelming but that establishes what the resistance is up against.
The finale was not overtly moving, or even remotely schmaltzy. It was effective and inspiring.
Best of all is the way I keep thinking about this film even as I forget I saw Star Trek.
This is not an Academy Award nominee but it is a solid film that's being beaten up because it had an unexpectedly layered story and a star who decided to be an actor instead.
As always, if you want any chance to enjoy something leave any and all expectations at the door.",1243814400,2,2848,4.705410821643286
3579074,4,B001FB55I0,"I was drawn in immediately, and that's not easy for a dedicated sci-fi fan who's seen it all. The opening action sequence alone is astonishing, even for a world overdosed on fx. And the ending is an example of the best in classical theater.

[...] I'd much rather be surprised, slapped with the unexpected. That's where creativity lies, where a good story leads you to a new place you've never been.
Sure there were some cloddy moments, but overall the story and atmosphere made for a rich world. One stark moment had Marcus Wright in the distance walking down a sand dune, with power lines in the foreground - a long pause, a silence; it hearkens back to the best of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Outer Limits"", making us look at our own world in a different way.

If there's one thing I judge a sci-fi (or any genre) film by, it's whether it makes me think about our existence and our future; this film, like the first two Terminators, rings that bell.

As for criticism of Christian Bale's performance, I can understand that to an extent; but remember, he wasn't given much to work with, so let's not get carried away with the analyzing. He carried the ball fine - and in the end it really is an ensemble piece involving not just the other actors but all the tech team as well.

True, the film is heavier, darker, more existential than its predecessors. There's also good mind-bending surrealism, characters getting shuffled like a kaleidoscope. Some people like their sci-fi lite, others go for the full deal. There is no question that - despite what critics may say - this film has set a new standard. Like ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within"", which was trashed by critics and then became a benchmark, I expect ""Salvation"" to rise in the coming years to a position of general respect.",1243814400,,1776,4.610759493670886
3579095,3,B001FB55I0,"We but create our own fate.

So, is John Connor the leader of the Resistance or a false prophet?  Perhaps a bit of both.

We start our tale with Marcus Wright, a convicted criminal who is about to get executed by lethal injection.  He signs a paper donating his organs to science -- Skynet!

We're introduced to 2018, a war-torn California where they are fighting only one of many branches of Skynet as it slowly exterminates humans and as we find, experimenting on them to create human-cyborgs that think and act human.  Quite an enemy that can take  on your own face and feelings.

Skynet however does not take into consideration the human frailties of love, honor and obedience.

What struck me about the film was how the humans were using the same tactics that the machines were, to the point of taking on their ruthlessness, even among their own kind.

Several points of interest:  How is there a working command base and air force if the machines are destroying humans?  You would think that would be fairly illogical to not destroy the human's war machines.  Oh well, just a story.

And the Dante's Inferno feel of the Skynet fortress, stepping deep into the 7th Circle of Hell with accompanying music -- moody and interesting!

Moon Bloodgood -- nice eye candy and a kickass fighter.  Yeah!

There is the inevitable child who knows more than she should; the inevitable bucking authority that gives an order but it is disobeyed in order to prevent a greater disaster, and ""if they only understood, then...."" motif.

Some of Terminator: Salvation has been done to death in other Hollywood films, but what sets it apart is the dynamic acting skill of Christian Bale.  I liked how the movie did not completely center around him, but when it did, he was the one evolving, changing with the times and adaptable.

Fans of the past Terminator films and the TV series will recognize ""I'll be back!""  and ""Follow me if you want to live!""

So does Kyle Rees make it to a time machine and meet Connor's mother and the Governor of California?

Who knows?  We make our own fate!

Great music score by Danny Elfman, adds a lot of excitement and thrill to an otherwise pedestrian science fiction film -- although, it's a damn sight better than Terminator 3!

3579096,3,B001FB55I0,"In the future, John Connor leads the human resistance against Skynet, a worldwide force of sentient machines hell-bent on destroying mankind, whom are viewed as mortal enemies.  In The Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, as a cyborg who has been sent back in time to kill John's mother Sarah Connor; it is believed that eliminating Sarah would prevent John from being born and allow the machines to ""win.""  A man named Kyle Reese is also sent back, by the humans, to protect Sarah; he succeeds, hence Skynet's attempt fails, and we find out that Kyle ends up being the father of the unborn John Connor.  Terminator 2: Judgement Day focuses on another killing machine, the T-1000, as it is sent back in time to kill John himself as a child, to fulfill the same purpose.  Yet again, the machines are met with failure.
 Way back when I saw Terminator 2 for the first time, I remember thinking that the storyline was one of the coolest in any of the movies I had seen.  That was over 12 years ago, when I hadn't seen many movies to begin with.  Even today, T2 stands as one of the best ever; the action, acting, music, and even special effects stand the test of time and still blow me away every instance I watch.  The Terminator, which I saw very soon after, filled in all the gaps and then some to a franchise that haunts me to this day.  Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines seems to be widely regarded as a critical failure and misstep in the series, a mockery of everything T1 had foretold and T2 had knocked out of the park: the antics of an aged Arnold Schwarzenegger, a ""Terminatrix,"" and a seemingly bad choice of actor for John Connor's character.  I couldn't disagree more; Arnie once again rocked, Nick Stahl pulled off a wonderfully believable John Connor, and the twist ending in my mind made for a more than worthy addition to one of my all-time favorite movie series.  And then there was the sadly now-defunct Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV series, also berated by many fans.  I thought it was genius in every regard.  If you couldn't tell, I'm a rabid Terminator fan.
 Fast forward to 2009, where director McG has unleashed Terminator Salvation upon the world.  I had been looking forward to this film for many months, not only because it's another Terminator movie, but because McG had a trump card:  Christian Bale of recent Batman fame as survivalist John Connor.  I was absolutely certain that both of these beloved factors combined would make for yet another masterpiece that would be treasured in the Terminator collection.  And days after I've seen it, I'm still not ready to determine whether or not it belongs there.
 The Terminator series, in my mind, were always more than just action movies.  They were foreboding, horrifying windows into the potential dangers of technology and nuclear war.  The state of the planet after Judgement Day, the machine-initiated nuclear attack, as illustrated by James Cameron in T1 and T2, was dark, menacing, bleak, and felt frightfully real.  Terminator Salvation changes that, not necessarily on purpose, but because the film feels like a repackaging of the first two, wrapped in the pretty red bow of current action movie pap all too common in today's world of short attention spans.  Salvation focuses on two main things: John Connor trying to find and save the life of Kyle Reese (who turns out to be his father), and on a man named Marcus who wants revenge on the machines for very different reasons.
 Fortunately, Salvation does do one thing very well:  keep the viewer on the edge of their seat with tons of action sequences and great special effects.  Those expecting another deep, existential, philosophical twist relating to the Terminator mythology however, will be disappointed.  This is really the paradoxical thing about Terminator Salvation:  I honestly did enjoy the movie.  But I can't seem to lump it with the other Terminator movies.  Maybe it's Christian Bale, whom I worship; he just plain and simple is not a good John Connor.  He acts his tail off, but I can't help but feel that he was brought on board for ""star power.""  Maybe it's McG's illustration of the state of the planet; post-Judgement Day is that of a desert wasteland, akin to the most recent movie outages of Resident Evil and Final Fantasy instead of the perpetual blackness and skull-ridden world of James Cameron.  Maybe it's the lack of emotive or relatable music short of the five-beat drum pattern synonymous with the Terminator series.  The whole thing feels, well, like someone did a Terminator movie just to do a Terminator movie.
 Those willing to overlook these nuances, though, are in for a treat.  Ripe with action, Salvation rarely lets the action movie reigns loose.  Vehicle chases, gun battles, and Terminator versus human hand-to-hand all brings the action part of the movie full circle.  Every turn is met with another shootout, another violent combat sequence, or another explosion.  The introduction of Marcus's character is a good one, too, adding somewhat of a branch to Connor's ongoing focus, and towards the end of the movie, secrets are revealed relating to Marcus's character that I found quite interesting.  In a risky move, as opposed to the other Terminator movies, Bale's Connor is a full-fledged military leader, both giving orders and taking them, and participates in several action scenes, including the long, final one that also includes a surprise cameo.
 As a stand-alone action movie, Terminator Salvation is quite good, but will let down the longtime franchise fan.  You'll be entertained, as long as you don't want to leave thinking about where the series will go next.  As for me, I'd just as soon watch another season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, ponder the events surrounding Judgement Day, and out of the corner of my eye see Terminator Salvation sticking out of my DVD collection waiting for a rainy day.",1243728000,3,5928,4.839285714285714
3579097,3,B001FB55I0,"Even if this movie had absolutely no expectations to live up to it would still be on the lower side of mediocre, but there are expectations and this movie meets none of them. This picture was just one giant let down after another. Sub-par action sequences spliced between over-the-top drama and very poor acting. Christian Bale is actually my second favorite actor and I wasn't even impressed with him.
Certain parts are just plain unwatchable, but I can't give too much away on that. One example though, just over halfway through the movie Sam Worthington reverts to his Australian accent after having done an American one up to that point! Seriously what kind of complete idiot let that one by? Just terrible plot, terrible plot holes, and completely unbelievable occurrences.(yes it's Sci-Fi, but suspension of disbelief only goes so far)
The writers have turned Sky-Net into a bumbling Bond movie Villain who can't kill anyone. If you watch it keep in mind that Sky-Net is a super intelligent Super-Computer and you tell me if any one of it's actions make sense whatsoever. But don't waste the money if you can help it.

Not even the presence of Christian Bale, who would be, technically (if you don't count the nameless actor, Michael Edwards, playing Post-JD!Connor, leader of the resistence) the fourth actor to take up the mantel of John Connor, seemed to dissuade the fears that Terminator Salvation was going to be a movie full of absolute Fail[ure].

Even I was filled with some doubt, if only because of the director (I hate the Charlies Angels movies) but was simply assured in the fact neither Christian Bale or Bryce Dallas Howard would give terrible performances in either roles as John & Kate connor, so that made it watchable enough for me. Kinda. But over the course of late 2008 to 2009, the multitude of trailers and later, TVSpots, dude, I was fully convinced that this movie could not suck in the least. Forget about those two movies McG directed, this was going to be the crowning achivement of his career and the actors employed could only make it better. Well, after a series of trial and error attempts to get out to the movies, I finally managed to drag my family out to a matinee theater to see this. I've gotta say, I was not disappointed.

Our tale begins with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for the murder of two police officers and his brother. On the day of the execution, he is approached by Cyberdyne Scientist, Serena Kogen (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman dying of cancer, to give up his body for medical research. He is resistent at first, but in exchange for a kiss, he obliges and signs his body over to Cyberdyne Systems before being rowed off to be killed. Fast forword Fifteen years later, its now 2018, Judgement Day has occured and the humans (in form of ""The Resistance"") fight against the now self-aware Skynet and its Terminators, in order to survive and reclaim their world.

John Connor (Christian Bale), however, is not the prophetize leader his mother, Sarah, built him up to become. Instead he is a lowly grunt, taking orders from the talking-heads of the Human Resistence, all of which are unwilling to take any of the information or knowledge he has on the Terminators or Skynet itself, seriously. After a somewhat botched attempt to retrieve informaton from a Skynet facility, John learns that Syknet is after a ""civilian"" named Kyle Reese (his father) and struggles to find a way to reach out and find him. Meanwhile find Marcus Wright, alive and well, awakens confused by the state of world around him. By twist of fate, he is rescued from a T-600 by a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin of Star Trek fame) and a mute girl named Star (Jadagrace Berry) who were apart of a fallen resistence in Los Angles.

After hearing one of John Connor's messages the group decide to try and find him, however, on the way, Kyle and Star are captured by Harvesters. In the wake of a botched rescue attempt, Marcus encounters Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), who promises to help him find his friends, if he comes to her base to meet John Connor, who will be more than willing to help him. The big problem with that idea? Marcus isn't exactly who he appears to be and once John Connor finds out, he finds himself faced with following orders or going against them in order to save the man that will become his father.

True to its word, we finally get to see what we've always been given a glimpse of in the previous Terminator films; the war against the Machines. However, I'm sure many will be disappointed to learn that they will not get the ocean of Terminators swarming across a vast field of skulls and rubble with laser guns, mowing down humans. Instead you get battles in ther forms of ""skirmishes"" or a simple scramble of humans running from their oppressors, fighting with everything at their disposal. McG, like Michael Bay (or Ridley & Tony Scott), has a eye for action sequences and excuted the lot of them with beautiful precision and smooth editing.

The first battle which introduces us to Bale's rendition of Connor, is a in your face and highly confusing melee of fire, crashing vehicles, and bullets. You are literally in the middle of the choas, being thrown about from the point of view of John Connor as he struggles to survive a monstrous explosion that kills his squad, a helicopter crash and attack from a crippled T-600. Afterward, the action sequences never fail to disappoint as they show a amazing utilization of the terminators and the human characters against them.

While by no means a horror movie in the least, the tension in certian scenes is so gripping I found myself... well, hugging myself in fear that I would loose it (yeah, I admit it, I'm a wimp). Your literally waiting for a Terminator to come around the corner whenever the characters find themselves in an otherwise unsafe place, searching for provisions. My particular favorite Terminator in this movie, is the Harvestor; The giant ""Transformer-like machine"" that captures humans for the testing of the T-700/800 Models, hearding them like cattle inside a transporter which it folds into. The Moto-Terminators come in at a close second.

That aside, this film impressed me on all the levels it really needed to. The vision of the future, while not the apocalypic city setting of the previous films, is bleak and baren. I wonder if McG took all the desert cues, where most of the film is set, from Mad Max/Mad Max 2, or even Resident Evil: Extinction (2007), as a lot of things from these films (particularly the ragged wardrobes of the human survivors and color saturated wide shots of the dusty world) came to mind when I was watching this. Now when concerned with the pace of the film, there were alot of things I felt could've been touched up on, but I gather this problem arises from the suspected massive amounts of ""editing"" it recieved to get the PG-13 Rating for a mass-viewing audience. Alot of scenes, particularly, the ones between the human characters, I felt had been removed/shortened to move the story along. The scene where Kate and John say good-bye to each other is a prime example. Even the dialouge felt a little sped up or out of sync, or maybe I'm just too accustomed to listening to the dialogue in the trailers and watching scenes that never made it into the movie.

On the subject of the characters, besides Marcus, Kyle (and by default Star), and Blair Williams to some extent, there really was nothing between them and you (the viewer) that allowed you to become terribly attatched to the characters. There was no exploration between the characters John and Kate Connor, which is what I would've loved to have seen, to give a glimpse into why they loved each other (or were even married), why in his right mind, John would knock up his wife in the middle of a war-torn world like the one they live in. It was by no means the actor's performances, they were just fine in my opinion (I'll get to that later), but I suppose the direction McG took with them really throws your sense of major concern off until the final gambit of the film. Only then do are you bitting your nails and praying [insert character name here] doesn't bite the dust. Alot of people will complain about the lack of major focus on John versus Marcus Wright, who is arguably the audience's POV for observing the desolate future of a post Judgement Day world, but it wasn't as big a problem as I feared it was. I was more or less worried about how they balance both John and Marcus' storylines, but the result is satisfactory for me. This is probably the one time I'm hoping there will be a Unrated/Director's Cut of Terminator Salvation once it becomes available to the public on Standard DVD & Blu-Ray.

When concerned with the performances, surprisingly, the strongest one is without a doubt Sam Worthington's. For a technical newcomer to US Shores (but a seasoned actor in his own right in the land of Australia), this guy really knocked it out of the park as Marcus Wright. Thank God for James Cameron's recommendation that's all I have to stay. The only negative thing I can really think of with his performance, and its not really a bother to me, was his accent; It was just all over the place. That aussie accent was so prominent in some scenes, I couldn't figure out if Marcus was supposed to be Australian or American. Anton Yelchin, on the other hand, gives a great performance as a young Kyle Reese. You could really pick up on the little personality quirks from Michael Biehn's performance, as the future 27-year old man sent back in 1984 in the original film, in Yelchin's performances, so kudos to this kid.

At the age of 14, Edward Furlong, in my opinion, has long since held the mantle as the best John Connor. Nobody has been able touch his performance, but Christian Bale easily makes him second in my book. Bale has never failed to give a good performance, whatever movie he happens to be in (good or bad), and while this is probably not his strongest performance (compared to his current-previous performances in Batman Begins, Rescue Dawn, The Prestige, or The Dark Knight), he brings an older John Connor to life as a hard and no-nonsense man, frustrated with his current position, with such a passion that I can't do anything except marvel at his work. While not really given much to do besides offer advise and look extremely pregnant in this film, Bryce Dallas Howard gives a better performance as Katherine ""Kate"" Connor than Claire Danes ever could in the awful T3: Rise of the Machines (I shall never forgive her for that extremely weak ""Just die, you bitch!"" line. Ugh, Failsauce. Danes has done extremely better in other films though). I hope Howard is given a little more do to in the sequel, should she appear again (I pray that she does).

Moon Bloodgood (of Journeyman fame), does extremely well as Blair Williams, though I thought her character was a little deminished when the director made it clear that she would become a potiential ""love interest"" of Marcus Wright, and wasn't too subtle about it. I wasn't opposed to it, but yeesh, McG, try sublty next time. Like Dallas-Howard, she isn't give much to do, but Bloodgood makes her time on screen worthy every penny. Ironically, Helena Bonham Carter as Serena Kogen, gives a very short-lived but impressive performance as a ailing woman looking for hope and a cold and calcuating machine, who effectively fools Worthington's character. At first, I was little disappointed with her final appearance, because I half-expected this pivotal scene of hers have her character return as nutty as Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter series. That fault as mine, however :P (that's what I get for trying to pegion-hold the woman). Jadagrace Berry, really had do nothing except be incredibly cute in silence and I loved every minute of her. I kept expecting the cliched ""Oh, she talked! Its a Miracle!"" moment to happen though. Overall, I say, more Jadagrace Berry!

Danny Elfman (which is amusing, given Helena-BC is in this movie) who composes for the movie, creates an effective action score that adds onto the tension of the action sequences. His Salvation theme is reminicient enough of the original theme to please this Terminator fan, though, ironically said theme also shows up in various moments of the film (especially when a certain T-800 model we all know and love appears). The nods to the previous movies were, for once, not bludgened over the heads of its viewers, and handled, in my opinion, with great care. I think my favorite homage, is without a doubt, the Judgement Day reference to a rebellious John Connor's youth with Gun'n'Roses' ""You Could be Mine"" roaring over the speakers of a dusty radio to attract the attention of a Moto-Terminator. There even a nice reference to the hey-day of Grunge Rock with some Alice in Chains' ""Rooster"" thrown into the mix. Ah, good times.

Finally, on the subject of the Special Effects, both Practical and Computer Generated alike, they were amazingly executed. While there were moments where the CGI peeked out and let you know it was just that, all the other times it was barely noticable. It creates and aids to the Apocalyptic setting of the film. The combined physical traits of body builder Roland Kickinger and the de-aged facade of the Governer of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, do a great job re-creating the menancing appearance for the T-800 model. However, the only thing I didn't like with that little gimmick is that they were damn quick to hide and get rid of Schwarzenegger's face in some scenes. The practical effects for the Terminators, handled by Legacy Studios (formerly known as Stan Winston Studios) were awesome. The leaps and bounds in animatronic technology displayed with the use of the T-600's and the Prototype T-800 are mindblowing. I hope there's a Oscar Nomination in their future after this.

Overall, despite its flaws, Terminator Salvation is a thousand times [infinity] better than Terminator: Rise of the Machines and a great inclusion to the previous two Terminator films. However, do not go into this movie thinking it will be the next Terminator: Jugement Day, because its not and never will be. I'm honestly surprised by the lukewarm responses this film has gotten, because its better than most people are giving it credit for. Overall, a solid [4 out of 5]. The Terminator has purpose and life again in the 21st century.",1243468800,,13997,4.775299463031805
3579100,4,B001FB55I0,"Contrary to conventional wisdom, Franchise films are a slippery slope for Hollywood Producers. They're an easy mark for securing funding; which is why such films can be a danger to themselves and the entire franchise. Like weekend alcohol consumption and the Police Academy movie franchise should have taught us, know when to stop.

That was my reason for pause when I learned about Terminator 4. My initial reaction was, ""another one""? Yes, the trailer looked good, but I still couldn't shake the feeling that McG was about to terminate the franchise. Despite my pause, I saw it over the long weekend, and I learned something that every drunkard and producer must know: When you're having a good time, what the hell, keep going. Terminator 4 is a good time. It's a good watch. No, it's not just a good watch. It's a surprisingly good watch - for reasons that are as equally surprising. Here are few:

1) Christian Bale is the film's co-star. The other guy - whoever he is - seems to get equal if not more screen time than Bale.

2) The Terminators are, relatively speaking, scarce in this movie. When they are on screen, boy, talk about screen presence!

3) The cliches in this film actually work. Even the blatant crucifixion pose in the beginning, despite being so heavy handed, was a nice touch.

There's a fourth surprise that you've probably already heard about, but just in case you haven't I'll leave that one alone.

Even the plot is not exactly what you'd think. The Terminators aren't so much killing people as they are collecting them. And they do so with ease. So the intense stainless-steel stalker story from the other three just doesn't apply here. McG has eschewed the cat and mouse game, for something else. He wants to tie-up loose ends from the first one, and then leave the franchise for some other director to drive into the mud. Before they do that,  I may go check this one out again. The drunks and the producers are indeed on to something: when you're having a good time, keep going.",1243468800,2,2009,4.65819209039548
3579101,3,B001FB55I0,"Like most serialized reruns, 'Terminator Salvation' doesn't live up to the originality of the original 'Terminator' film.  It's simply a computerized violent revisitation of a theme now grown stale.

At the same time, there will be new viewers who will be fascinated by the concept and the action.  For these people, I recommend that they go back an revisit the original film in which we first enter a world where our mechanical contraptions have become sentient and set out to annihilate the human species.

As a action flick, 'Salvation' is OK but, that said, it is a fairly standard action flick.  The humans who are fighting metal robots frequently survive blows that would have killed an elephant.  Not only do they survive them, but jump right up to continue the fight.

3579103,5,B001FB55I0,"Terminator Salvation is a 2009 American science fiction post-apocalyptic war film released on May 21, 2009,Directed by McG, it is the fourth film in the Terminator series and stars Christian Bale as John Connor, before becoming leader of the Resistance, and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who believes he is human. It also introduces a young version of the first film's hero, Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, and depicts the origins of the T-800 Model 101 Terminator. Being both a sequel and a prequel to the previous films, Salvation, set in 2018, focuses on the war between humanity and Skynet. It abandons the time travel element of previous entries in the series, which centered on Terminators and other characters traveling through time to either kill or protect John Connor before the events of Judgment Day unfold. After Skynet has destroyed much of humanity in a nuclear holocaust, John struggles to become the leader, but in this future, Marcus Wright has somehow altered it, and the T-800 is coming online sooner than expected. The film also centers on Kyle Reese and how he became who he was in the first film.maintained are two elements of the previous films; that John is an outsider to the authorities, and someone of future importance is being protected, and in this film it is Kyle Reese. The film's theme is ""where you draw the line between machines and humans"".The friendship between Marcus -- who was executed (for murder) when humanity still ruled the world -- and Kyle Reese illustrates how war and suffering can bring out the best in people.
The title was derived from this second chance given to humanity and to Marcus, in addition to John's efforts to save humanity from the machines.
The machines are, Aerostats, which are smaller versions of the Aerial Hunter Killers from the previous films. The Aerostats send a signal to the 60-foot-tall humanoid Harvesters. They are very big and slow, so they utilize Mototerminators to capture humans, and the Harvesters place them in Transporters. The T-1,which makes a brief return in the film as one of the machines guarding prisoners as they head into their holding cells. The film features the rubber-skinned T-600s and T-700s as interpreted by Kyle Reese's description in the original film. Completing Skynet's domination of air, land and sea is the Hydrobot. The Film is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and language, unlike the previous R-rated films.

3579104,4,B001FB55I0,"When the news first broke that a fourth ""Terminator"" movie was in the works and that none other than ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG would be at the helm, the fan-boy world let out a collective groan. It helped matters that Christian Bale signed on to play the savior of the human race, John Connor, but for the most part, ""Terminator Salvation"" had an up-hill battle to fight. Here we are with the fourth installment in a franchise that many doubt should have gone past James Cameron's masterpiece, ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" in the first place. This is the third director to tackle the material, with a script penned by the same guys who delivered the poorly received ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (not to mention ""Catwoman."" Yikes!). To make matters even more complicated, the script has been re-heated and doctored by Jonathan Nolan (""The Dark Knight"") to make the role of John Connor bigger and fatter than in the original script. All of this, while being made within the constraints of a PG-13 rating (a first for the series) and a toy-company to pacify. With so many cooks in the kitchen, so many expectations to meet and so many watching and judging, it's quite amazing, then, that it turned out as well as it did.

""Terminator Salvation"" begins with Marcus (Sam Worthington), a man on death row for killing his brother, among others. Coerced by a cancer-ridden lover, Serena (Helena Bonham-Carter), he signs off on letting his soon-to-be-dead body be used for scientific experiments and advancements. We watch him receive only the best capital punishment that Texas can afford, only to find himself resurrected in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, circa 2018. The Judgment Day that Sarah Connor warned about has devastated mankind, as they fight for survival against Skynet and the machines who see humans as the enemy and seek to eliminate them. The self-fulfilling prophet, John Connor (Bale), has yet to take his rightful place, though. There are those who believe in him, and those in power (Michael Ironside) who don't. When his future (or his past) is put into question -- his future father, a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), is captured and on his way to termination -- he must work together with a man -- or a machine -- whom he was raised not to trust.

If the story sounds incomplete, or that it's missing something, then you aren't alone. The biggest problem facing this film is its script. Maybe it worked better in its original form, but by making more room for the character of John Connor, it starts to bloat and loses its impact. It doesn't help that the film is short, clocking in at well under two hours, and doesn't allow enough time to flesh out its plot-points. For example, you'll notice Connor's wife (Bryce Dallas-Howard, replacing Claire Danes) is visibly pregnant, and yet, nothing is ever mentioned about it in the film. The character of Marcus Wright is an intriguing and original addition to the ""Terminator"" mythos, played perfectly and convincingly by Worthington. While this part of the story is fleshed out well-enough, it's often put on the sidelines to make screen-time for Bale/John Connor. While you couldn't ask for a better adult John Connor than Christian Bale, there's simply not enough for him to do in this film, other than to give inspiring speeches to his comrades or go hand-to-hand combat with the machines. He makes an imposing and impressive Connor, giving the expected intensity and presence, but the character is barely expanded upon what was already given to us in the first two films. In short, if you're a newcomer watching this flick, you're not likely to be convinced that this man is all that important to the future of mankind and maybe -- just maybe -- he's got an overblown ego and a nasty temper.

On the upside of things, director McG (real name Joseph McGinty Nichols) deserves a round of applause. Not only did he take fan-boy criticisms in stride throughout the creation of the film, but on his end -- the direction -- the film is a smashing success. While the story is weak and flawed, the visual aspect of the film is stunning. Full-on, from the moment we are re-introduced to the John Connor character, you believe that what you are seeing is a post-Judgment day world. One key moment early in the film finds Connor's allies annihilated by a bomb, covering the area in a sea of smoke and a rain-storm of ash. It's a far-cry from the brief war scenes we were given in the previous ""Terminator"" films, and in this particular scene, inspiration seems to have been drawn from Steven Spielberg's World War II epic, ""Saving Private Ryan."" Obviously, this is a fictional war, and not as dense as the real-life tragedy Spielberg portrayed in his film, but visually, McG nails it. Another spot where the film shines are in its special effects.  True to the late-Stan Winston's method, most of the effects are achieved practically, rather than relying too heavily on CGI. The Terminators in the film look not only mean and heartless, but real. Heck, we even get Arnold Schwarzenegger's face rendered to Roland Kickinger's body, to re-create the famous T-800, and it's hard to tell the difference between real and fake. All of this, of course, on top of one outrageous action sequence after another and nods to previous films galore. You'll see motorcycles chasing tractor-trailer trucks in an interesting role reversal, and you'll watch as John Connor sets traps to the tune of Guns N' Roses ""You Could Be Mine."" All of these elements help seal the deal, making it feel like an authentic ""Terminator"" sequel and less of a cash-in (which, for the most part, it is). In the end, despite being light on plot and character development, ""Terminator: Salvation"" packs enough of a punch to be considered a worthy entry in the franchise and a brilliant summer blockbuster to boot.",1243296000,,5849,4.82851445663011

And then it was announced that Charlie's Angels helmer McG would be calling action on the film and I got nervous...When Christian Bale was cast as John Connor--I got really excited again...Given all of those ups and downs before the release of Terminator Salvation I suppose it's fitting that my feelings for the finished product ended up being pretty mixed...

The film opens--it is 2003, death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) is housed at the Longview Correctional Facility where he meets with Dr Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), a representative of Cyberdyne Systems to donate his organs and tissue for what he believes will be a good cause.

He wakes up 15 years after his execution, in 2018, to find a desolated downtown Los Angeles...

At the same time, John Connor (Bale) on a nearby Skynet base, is the sole survivor of an assault. He discovers plans to develop the T-800, as well as a Skynet transport carrying captured humans, who are being moved to Skynet's main base of North American operations in San Francisco.

Connor returns to a nuclear sub acting as Resistance headquarters and tells Resistance leader General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) of his discovery. Ashdown informs Connor that, even though it will result in the deaths of most of the prisoners, an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco is planned to take place in four days. When Connor asks why it would be in four days, it is revealed that the Resistance intercepted a transmission from Skynet, listing people that they planned to kill in four days: first on the list is Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), second is Connor, and the rest are the command staff of the Resistance. The resistance has also discovered a frequency that could possibly be used to force Skynet machines to shut down. After leaving the submarine, Connor speaks with his second in command, Barnes (Common). He also reunites with his wife, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard).

Meanwhile. after stealing clothes from a dead Resistance fighter, Marcus makes his way through the city to discover that the only human survivors there are a teenage Kyle Reese and his young, silent, child companion named Star (Jadagrace). .

As Marcus and Kyle leave L.A. city behind to meet Connor, their vehicle comes under fire by various terminators, which takes Kyle and Star alive in a round up of humans to transport to a prisoner camp. Marcus, however, is left behind.

Connor is determined to discover why Skynet is taking human prisoners. The Resistance picks up unusually concentrated machine activity in the Los Angeles Basin and dispatch fighters to intercept the hunter-killers in the area. One of them, Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) a pilot, is shot down and rescued by Marcus, and the interception fails.

The script from John D. Brancato & Michael Ferris sets up things nicely--allowing for plenty of T-action....But...I know that we are dealing with the end of the world type stuff--I must say, the film is almost too dark...I missed the type of humor (provided by Arnie) from the other films...Everything was too serious...

McG staged some great action scenes and the late great Stan Winston's crew pulled off some great FX and all--But this is a summer flick that's STILL not all that fun to watch--

As Connor Bale was just OK--which in and of itself was a surprise--Was I expecting too much from him? Maybe...I was more impressed with Worthington as Wright--Whose character had an engaging arc in the film and he really pulls it off.

Yelchin's Reese served as more of a major ""Save him or we wreak our future"" plot point than anything else. Hopefully he's got more to do in the next one.

Howard, Bloodgood and Carter are there yes--but are pushed out to focus on Bale and Worthington.

3579137,3,B001FB55I0,"In the year 2018, humans are resisting the machines Skynet created called terminators. John Connor is the man who is destined to lead the resistance. Everything John Connor knows is turned inside out when he comes across Marcus Wright. Marcus was put to death by lethal injection in 2003 for killing his brother and two cops yet here he stands today. When an all out assualt by John's superiors is declared on Skynet, John finds out that Kyle Reese (the man who would eventually become his father) has been captured and will be caught in the blast, he knows his only choice is to join forces with Marcus, rescue the human prisoners, and bring Skynet down.

Christian Bale may have been the biggest disappointment in this film. After everyone heard the sound clip of him blowing up on set at a cinematographer, everybody kind of wondered if Bale's success was getting to his head. Well, it just might have. That clip seemed to run through my mind an awful lot throughout the duration of the film. My biggest complaint was that John Connor yelled the majority of the time, even when there was no reason to. When he did talk normally, he used his Batman voice. It just didn't seem to fit since Bale is more than capable of altering his accent (Harsh Times, Rescue Dawn, The Prestige). It's an issue that was bound to come up eventually, but just didn't really click until now.

The other weak link of the film had to be the dialogue. It is incredibly cheesy at times. At the beginning of the film, one of John Connor's superiors yells, ""You tell those men to respond, even if they're dead!"" It just seemed to be over the top more often than not. While the dialogue was a bit on the atrocious side, the story did have one interesting element going for it. The entire film revolves around this element and is really the only new factor brought in to the Terminator franchise. While the film had its low points, I kept thinking that the film at least had this going for it. Then the ending rolled around and just completely dropped the ball.

With all the negative components of the film, there are still quite a few pieces of the puzzle that are worth mentioning. The action scenes are beyond superb. The camera always seems to be in the right spot at the right time and it isn't too close, which is a definite plus. It seems to be too close during action sequences and fighting scenes in most films these days and most of the action gets lost in the shuffle (Transformers is a good example). Being able to see everything without wondering what happened to this character or that character is a nice change. Something that should definitely happen more often. The entire scene with The Harvester is pretty phenomenal. There are also quite a few throwbacks to the first two films of the franchise. ""Come with me if you want to live,"" and, ""I'll be back,"" are both used in the film, Kyle Reese uses his signature weapon, a sawed off shotgun, Marcus Wright knocks the windshield out of the wrecking truck in a similar fashion the T-1000 did with the diesel in T2, John Connor cocking a gun and firing at a T-800 while being wounded much like Sarah Connor did with the T-1000 while being wounded in T2, and I'm sure quite a few more that I missed.

Sam Worthington should be getting all the attention Christian Bale is for this film. He actually makes you care about Marcus Wright despite what he's done in the past. The way he portrays his emotions and how he's done these horrible things yet is a decent guy deep down inside just makes you want to root for him. Anton Yelchin also deserves a mention. His version of Kyle Reese is pretty much spot on with how you'd imagine a younger version of Kyle Reese to act. His mannerisms, the way he talks, everything. He nailed it.

The sound was also spectacular. Sounds of huge terminators echoed off the walls and made the ground shake, helicoptor blades seemed to chop through the air in violent strokes, motorcycles screeched from one side of the theater to the other to sound like they were going right by you, and you could feel the area around you rumble whenever there was a huge explosion. The sound is definitely a huge aspect of an action film and it really delivered here.

Terminator: Salvation is worth seeing, but being a fan of the franchise and having high expectations may leave you walking away in disappointment. The film doesn't really elaborate on the war between humans and machines or really add anything to the franchise, when all is said and done. If you can somehow remember the first two films yet not compare this sequel with them while ignoring plot holes, Christian Bale's over the top performance, and cheesy dialogue, then you may be able to enjoy Terminator: Salvation to its full extent. But if you're looking for a great action film, then this film delivers.",1243209600,6,4829,4.56401384083045
3579138,3,B001FB55I0,"In my opinion, compared to this year's other additions to popular franchises, ""Terminator Salvation"" stands somewhere above ""Wolverine"" but below ""Star Trek."" This movie had so much promise, but sadly fell flat.

On the bright side, the movie looked good, it had excellent special effects and some great action scenes, it was able to hold my attention almost throughout.

On the other hand, it could have been so much better! First of all, the script needed some major work - the story was so muddled in the beginning, it was hard to stay interested. It was my impression the movie  was supposed to be about John Connor, however, somewhere along the way my attention totally shifted to Marcus - half-robot/half-human - and his journey to find out what had happened to him. I found myself much more interested in him rather than John Connor, his wife, resistance, or Kyle. Considering that Marcus was meant to be a secondary character, it is very sad, isn't it? The story should have been more focused and followed the scheme of first 3 Terminator movies.

Secondly, I am getting sick of directors putting characters in the movies only to be politically correct or in attempt to attract different demographics. I am talking about characters of Common and silent girl that didn't serve any kind of purpose.

Finally, I have to agree with many reviewers that the world after the Judgment day didn't look quite like the one portrayed in previous Terminator movies.  The Resistance seemed to have as much resources (weapons, helicopters) as Skynet; the survivors were way too good-looking, rested and clean. Well, you get the picture.

Overall, it was an OK movie. I enjoyed some parts of it, mainly toward the end. I am grateful that a new noteworthy actor was introduced to us - Sam Worthington who played Marcus. I think he ""owned"" this movie. It is curious if this franchise will go on though, I heard it was meant to make three new Terminator movies...",1243209600,4,1952,4.808955223880597
3579139,1,B001FB55I0,"ok I'm a big fan of the Terminator series but I was not happy when I left the theater. I'll be fare in saying that it was well made & I could tell a lot of work went into the movie. But I just didn't like it. The beginning of the film really dragged; I could count on one hand how many actual terminator robots showed up to get the action going. Also, the diaglogue was really difficult to understand in the helecopter scene; I missed the whole conversation over the chopper sounds and the yelling. I can't believe I'm saying it, but the story would have been better if they'd cut out John Conner and just followed Kyle & the confused Android dude (whose name escapes me)- there was a lot to work with between these two characters they were interesting and the story should have just featured the two of them as the stars and then end the film the two characters meeting up with john conner at the end. All John did was walk around in his sewer house and talk on the radieo and be boring. Well he had a few fight scenes but those scenes could have been done by the other two actors.

skip this next part if you don't want a spoiler:
My favorite John Conner scene is when he goes on the radieo and tells the human resistance around the world to NOT attack Skynet for the sake of their future. Call me picky, but why the heck would these people listen to him. half of them don't believe he's the real prophet and NONE of them know that human prisoners are being held at skynet, so i found that scene...peculiar...""YES, LET US ALL NOT ATTACK SKYNET, OUR MOST HATED ENEMY AND STICK IT TO THE MEN IN CHARGE!FOR OUR...FUTURE?""

finally, the last thing i didn't like was the whole ""Stick it to the Man"" attitude Conner displayed. clearly it's hollywood military but i come from a miliatary family and know a few things one of which is that you do not argue with your superior, DUH! when will hollywood get that right?",1243209600,4,1910,4.28808864265928
3579140,4,B001FB55I0,"Months before the release of the latest entry in the Terminator franchise the movie's leading man Christian Bale was out creating negative buzz for the movie when the press found out about his onset meltdown thanks in part to TMZ somehow getting their hands on a tape of his profanity laced on set rant which was directed at the film's Cinematographer.  This lead many to speculate if Bale wasn't just playing crazy in the film ""American Psycho"" especially since Bale had previously been arrested for allegedly assaulting his mother and sister in 2008.  The question was soon raised would Bale's behavior cause some people to not watch his latest film?  Outside of this negative buzz surrounding the film's leading man there was the issue of the disastrous film Terminator 3:  Rise of the Machines (2003).  Would this terrible movie still be fresh in the minds of many movie goers and prevent many from giving T4 a fair chance?

The answer to both questions is yes.  Personally, I have no problem with Bale I think he's a talented and intense actor.  The only reason I wrestled with the idea of not taking a chance on this film for awhile had to do with my opinion of T3, which I think is one of the worst movies ever made.  I eventually opted to see T4 in the theatres for appreciation of the greatness of what writer-director James Cameron created 25 years ago with Terminator and his follow-up to his masterpiece Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).

Sure, I knew that James Cameron wasn't involved in the writing or the making of the fourth film, but still the potential for greatness was there.  Luckily this potential was realized in this film.  This time around the setting is the bleak future that you've been hearing about and which was briefly glimpsed in all the other films.  The year is 2018 and John Connor is FINALLY an adult (33 to be exact).  While he's not quite the true leader of the resistance yet except in spirit he is still able to inspire people around him.

Much like the first 2 films this movie features well done action sequences that get this are filmed without the amateurish- shaky camera work seen in such abysmal films as Aliens vs. Predator and the Resident Evil films.  The action scenes are not only well choreographed and filmed well they are also entertaining to watch.

T4 pays homage to the other Terminator films in subtle but recognizable ways.  If you recall in T2 they show a 44 year old John Connor with a scar on his face leading human forces against the machines.  T4 shows Terminator fans just how he got that scar.  Also a few popular Terminator quotes are nicely incorporated in the film, they use Linda Hamilton's voice and picture as Sarah Connor in ways that fit nicely into the story, the film also as some scenes reminiscent of Cameron's Terminator movies, and a there is also an unexpected, but much welcomed cameo.

 This movie also showcases the talents of 2 male actors who have the potential to go on to become big stars.  These men are attractive but relatively unknown Aussie Sam Worthington who makes a good impression with his portrayal of Marcus Wright.  In fact Worthington is so good in his part that he steals with show from Christian Bale.  This is not to say that Bale does a bad job, because he does a good job in the role of the charismatic John Connor it's just that Worthington brought a lot more to his character.  The other talented male actor worth looking out for is Anton Yelchin who plays a young Kyle Reese (he also plays Chekov in the new Star Trek film).  Yelchin plays his part in the film in a heartfelt and convincing manner.  He is 100% believable as a teenage Kyle Reese.

While the movies special effects don't have the original 2 films wow factors since those films were doing something brand new and innovative when they were made T4's special effects are still astonishing nonetheless.

I would recommend people watch this film. This includes fans of the James' Cameron Terminator movies, Terminator fans in general as well as the casual movie-goer. It's definitely a worthy addition to the franchise and happens to be a good summer action flick in general that's worth your time and money.

3579141,4,B001FB55I0,"Despite the apparent flaws that lie within it, Terminator: Salvation manages to be a worthy installment of the franchise that James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger first birthed 25 years ago.  Taking place in the post-Judgement Day 2018, Terminator: Salvation follows the paths of John Connor (Christian Bale) and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington); two men whose paths are interlocked with each other in the machine ravaged future world.  For Connor, he is the heralded savior of mankind, fighting Skynet and the machines that have been trying to kill him since before he was born at every turn, while trying to locate Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), a young man targeted by Skynet because he is John's future father.  For Marcus, the last thing he remembers was that he was on death row in 2003, and now finds that he is not himself these days to say it lightly.  Despite any misgivings anyone had about director McG (Charlie's Angels) at the helm, rest assured that he more than competantly handles some dynamite action scenes.  The only flaw of them is that the film's story is really nothing more than an excuse to get said action scenes going in the first place.  Still, you can't argue that Bale is more than solid as the grizzled John Connor, while Worthington gives a star-making performance.  Seriously, this guy is good and is a definite future star on the rise and worth looking out for.  Moon Bloodgood makes for more than eye-candy as pilot Blair, while Bryce Dallas Howard, Common, Helena Bonham Carter, and genre stalwart Michael Ironside don't really get to do too much.  There's plenty of odes to the first two Terminator films, whether it be through dialogue or the use of Guns N Roses' ""You Could Be Mine"" from T2, and the arrival of a familiar face as the film races towards its conclusion is a welcome sight indeed.  The only truly major flaw for me was the film's ending.  If you had heard of the leaked original ending to film, let's just say that that would have been a ballsier way to end the film, where as here we just get left with the door open for more struggles against the machines.  Still though, Terminator: Salvation is a big, loud, and enjoyable installment that is worthy of its predecessors, and in that respect alone, it is a solid success that is worth your time.",1243123200,2,2299,4.70573566084788
3579142,2,B001FB55I0,"Yes, it's true, Christian Bale reprises his Bat-voice (""I do not have throat cancer!""  *punch*  - see YouTube Joker Interrogation video) as the future John Conners here in this disappointing reboot of the Terminator franchise, playing the role much as he would have the Dark Knight.  Bale spends much of the movie yelling at the top of his Bat-voice, often times for no good reason.

This movie helped to remind me that although I have eagerly anticipated all the Terminator sequels, I have been disappointed by all of them to varying degrees since the original classic.  None of the subsequent films have had the same sort of emotional connection to the central characters that the first Terminator movie had.  The love story of Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner and their appealing nature, together with Arnold's scary-hilarious turn as the Terminator, was what made the first movie in this franchise so special.

In this movie, none of the characters are given enough time or dialogue that we ever care anything about them.  The few good bits with the Marcus Wright and Blair Williams characters are cut short and kept too sparse to fill them out either.

The movie lacks originality - some of the scenes are recycled/copied from other movies - the scene of the fireball explosions in the trees by the river is from ""Apocalypse Now"", the tension of waiting for the industrial elevator scene is from ""Aliens"", the robot frozen in place only to break free is from ""Terminator 2"".

And so this movie becomes just another hyperkinetic action movie, with lots of fighting, explosions, car crashes, and scary robots chasing after scared humans.

Even as an action movie, this movie suffers as many of the action sequences didn't make sense.  There is almost no sense of continuity in the action in large parts of this movie as cuts from one set to another are completely disconnected.  For example, in the opening sequence, we go from what looks like a radio telescope farm in the desert, which has become a battlefield, to John Conner rappelling down a giant hole/tunnel  in the ground which has suddenly appeared,  to a dark tunnel/sewage system filled with water (what's that doing in a desert?),  to a dark laboratory filled with bodies on lab tables, to a dark prison filled with human prisoners, to a clean and shiny computer center.  And then all of a sudden John Conner is seen climbing back up again to the first set, the radio telescope farm in the desert, except mysteriously, everybody around him is dead.

The final fight scenes at SkyNet were equally baffling, as the fighting moves back and forth between what looks like a steel foundry (where else would you find a vat of molten iron?), a robot factory, a prison for humans, and a computer center.  WTF?

The location of John Conners's resistance section varies from an air base to this dark underground cave-like warren to this rather elaborate mined compound with watchtowers and barbed wire, all located next to a river that is filled with angry Hydrobots.  WTF again?  Nothing connects!  Just what the heck is the human resistance doing with helicopters and A-10 aircraft on an air base anyway?  I thought this was supposed to be the post-nuclear holocaust human society - you simply cannot hide an air base, or any sort of fixed command base from nuclear weapons!

Isn't there something in Basic Filmaking 101 that tells you how to get scenes to connect?

I must admit that I love this franchise - it's really the memories of the very first movie that keeps me going in spite of all the disappointments.  And so I forced myself to sit through another viewing of this movie ..... and promptly fell asleep during parts of the second viewing.  All the loud explosions, the yelling, and the noise, just got surprisingly repetitive and boring.

One can blame the poor characterizations and lousy plot on the scriptwriters. One can blame Christian Bale's ego for staying on his one-note crusade as Batman in this movie.  But when the movie fails even to keep you awake in its basic role as a thrilling action adventure movie, there is only one three letter word that you can blame for this whole mess:

McG

I do hope this franchise continues with a better director and better scriptwriting (if you're going to make a movie with giant robots, why not Michael Bay? and yes, McG definitely is losing in his spat with Bay).

Although this is a weak reboot, the Terminator franchise has such a strong foundation that much can be done to improve things in the future.  Christian Bale is a terrific actor - he just needs a strong director to tell him to ACT instead of yell and play Batman all the time.  The Marcus Wright and Blair Williams characters introduced here in this movie also have much potential for the future.

Here's hoping...",1243123200,3,4791,4.757869249394673
3579143,3,B001FB55I0,"Firstly, I'm a huge Terminator fan, and despite Cameron's abscence on all the incarnations of the mythology after the Universal Studios 3-D ride i've been an avid follower of the Terminator franchise.  I had read only one article concerning this new film in last month's Fangoria, and Mcg, the director, stated that it was going to follow the mythology set by the first two films and leave out the third, but after viewing the film I found that to be untrue.  Even Salvation's script was written by the same screenwriters of part three, Brancato and Ferris.  Before I go any further, let me see if I can get the Terminator movie timeline down:
Terminator happened in 1984.
T2 happeneed 13 years later in 1997.
Terminator 3 happened  ten years later in 2007.
Finally, this film happens  eleven years later in 2018.

Okay, I think I got it, unless some fanboys out there can correct me.  Sorry Rise Of The Machines haters, this is a direct sequel to that film.  It uses the last film's new timeline and also brings back the newly introduced character of Kate Brewster, this time played by Bryce Dallas Howard filling in for Claire Danes.  Characters, HA!  That's one of this sequels biggest problems, the characters aren't interesting even one bit.  They're all action movie cyphers, that are barely indistinguishable.  I mentioned Bryce Dallas Howard earlier, and I still can't figure out why she would want to be in this film.  She has nothing to do, but look concerned for John and rush around.  The relationship that the third film hinted at is all but glossed over and we find our couple already ready to have a baby in the midst of war.  Guess, protection like condoms were wiped out completely in the nuclear holocaust.  Maybe they should have gone to one of the many abandoned 7-11's still standing .

The two main characters in this film are John Connor(Christian Bale), of course, and a new character, an ex-con found in cryo sleep named Marcus(Sam Worthngton).  I was excited by Bale's casting as the older Connor.  Adding him to the cast meant, at least to me, that the new Connor would be more war worn but still have some humanity.  I'm sorry to report that any action movie star could've played the Connor in this film.  He's more robotic then, well, the robots.  Long gone are the human touches added by Edward Furlong and to a lesser degree Nick Stahl.  It's sad because one of the climax's big emotional beats is lost because of the way the character is portrayed and written.  I understand that this Connor has to be harder, but this hard makes him unrelatable and even worse, uninteresting.  Sam Worthington is far more interesting.  He is your basic anti-hero with a secret past.  There is a point when he has a relationship with a downed resistance pilot, but it's far too brief and not depthful enough to justify why she helps him out of a jam later in the film.  She is played well enough, the actress' last name is Moonblood(can't think of the first name at the moment).  She's brings a likeable and HUMAN presence to a film that desperately needs it.  Too bad there wasn't more of her.  Her relationship with Marcus in the final film relies more on the 100 year old and well known to the audiences of cinema convention of what must happen when two strangers of the opposite sex have a chance encounter.  Unfortunately, Marcus' character's two main plot twists are either ruined by the trailers or just predictable.

Special mention must go to Anton Yelchin.  He does a spot on impression of Michael Biehn's character from the first film in his teenage form.  He must've watched and listened to Michael Biehn very closely.  Though he doesn't look anything like the original's Kyle Reese you can feel his presence.

The lost humanity in this film I feel is due to some editing in the final film.  Since the film is 90% action and no interesting dialogue or character moments I suspect the studio asked Mcg to edit the movie down to its basic plot and get to the action scenes faster.  I suspect an unrated director's cut dvd in the future with more then graphic violence added back into the film.  Mcg does a good job with this film.  The tone is dark, much darker then the last film's.  The action scenes are good but not too over the top.  If the character beats were stronger or existed on any level the scenes would've had much more impact.  I really do believe these character beats exist, in no small way due to the fact that I know that screenwriter Paul Haggis(Casino Royale, Crash, In the Valley of Allah) was a ghost writer on this.

The PG-13 rating doesn't effect this film.  It's brutal and dark and unrelenting in its tone and violence.  There's a couple of gun battles where you can tell some bullet hits were edited out but that's about it.  Plus, the lack of profanity makes the film feel less authentic as a war film.  But that's about it.

The special effects are good and KEWL and blah, blah, blah, blah...Do we even need to mention them anymore when it comes to big Hollywood films?  Speical effects are so pristine these days it makes you wonder why the characters and story haven't become important again.  They should be after this summer, which is shaping up to be a major let down as far as the big genre films go.  Though, and this one is impressive and scary, the special effects that were used to give Arnold Schwarzenegger is cameo without him having to show up for filming were very impressive.  It was fun seeing Arnold the way he looked back in 1984, down to the hair cut.  Scary, seeing how with the scripts that get filmed these days, how actors bringing any life to a film may not be necessary one day.

I really wanted to like this film and I suspect I will once the dvd comes out in its director's cut.  This movie feels like Skynet took over the edit.  Way too many machines blowing up stuff real good and not enough of the humanity that the previous films had.  If I'm wrong about the edit, and there's no director's cut, then I feel less bad about not giving this film its fourth star.  Sigh....",1243123200,4,6058,4.544362292051756

3579166,1,B001FB55I0,"Not learning from either the massive successes of their first two films or the junk heap which was the third, the writers/producers continued toying with a great franchise.

And it's not just a case of 'memories from the past'. They toyed with how to kill the terminators themselves. Which if you're going to do a 'future' in today's now-future, using the then-technology which was already established to elaborate on that same storyline (as was infered) would make sense. This was actually a key feature of the films, what made them such a 'good' tool as had been conceptualized by Skynet.

Instead, in a lame attempt to be 'current' the special effects department makes new ways to kill the machines---inadvertently toying with the franchise's whole pre-established backstory.

Ugggh! Just leave good enough alone already.

Christian Bale is a great actor and I've seen him rescue other franchises (remember Batman?). So this abomination should not rest at his feet in any way. He did the best he could with the material with which he was provided to work with. And for this I commend him.

I also like Bryce Dallas Howard, playing Kate Connor, the role previously inhabited by Claire Danes. Coming across as John's partner in the film, they are going to save humanity togeter. I could not help but think of today's bleak economic scenario while watching the two of them work together for a 'better tommorrow'. This part of the film was salvageable.

The writers and the producers are the ones who need to be held responsible for having allowed this project to have seen the light of day.",1243123200,12,1590,4.87037037037037
3579167,3,B001FB55I0,"The first Terminator movie, released twenty-five years ago (!), was a brooding masterpiece of hopeful nihilism.  T2 provided powerful lessons in empowerment and introduced a kinder, gentler Terminator, one more appropriate for a future Governator.  T3 was more of the same and successfully teed up potential story avenues for multiple interesting characters.  The latest chapter, Terminator Salvation, drops the ball.

Like the latest Star Trek movie, T4 is an origin story and in this one, set in the year 2018, we have for the first time, a prolonged look at an adult John Connor and get to see how he meets the incomparable Resistance fighter, Kyle Reese, the hero of the original film.  And therein lies the problem with Terminator Salvation.

Because Reese eventually is ordered by John Conner to go back in time to ensure his mother's survival, and thus the birth of John Conner who eventually defeats Skynet, we know that ultimately Conner and Reese have to make it through the travails of the current chapter.  We know they are in no real danger.

The new Star Trek prequel somewhat got around this dilemma by delivering constant dollops of focus on the main characters (and by placing the action in a parallel universe).  However, T4 effectively abandons the intense interpersonal human drama and watertight logic of its predecessor movies.  In fact, even cursory scrutiny leads one to believe that in the next ten years humankind will know how to subsist despite no visible means of agriculture, produce an unlimited supply of ammunition for automatic weapons and be able to surgically transplant vital organs without such complicating factors as the need for matching blood types or a sterile operating environment.

The cast does as good a job as was possible with the material.  Connor is played by Christian Bale, who ably reflects the literally world-weary Resistance leader.  Anton Yelchin, who plays Reese, pretty much steals every scene in which he appears.  And although Blood Moongood (are you serious?) is fetching as the winsome Blair, her fairly whiny presence as the only major female character only underscores how much the series has veered from T1 & T2 director James Cameron's penchant for strong female protagonists.  After the first two movies, I felt like I knew Sarah Connor, and, uh, Blair is no Sarah Connor.

One of the two most interesting aspects of the film is in the character of Marcus Wright, played by Australian actor Sam Worthington.  To continue with the parallels to Star Trek, Marcus is a red shirt.  In other words, when the leading characters on the enterprise beamed into hostile territory, we knew none of them would suffer mortal danger, so to show that the aliens were Really Bad People who could do Really Bad Things, a crew member who wore a red shirt usually bit the dust.  In an irony introduced midway through the movie, Worthington's character ends up being the most human of all.

The other high point is in the special effects. The visuals in T4 are stunning.  This world of Skynet is filled with original Terminator models for as far as the eye can see, liquid metal Terminators and Trojan Horse Terminators that release Motorcycle Terminators.  There are even mammoth Jurassic Park Terminators capable of snatching up hapless Resistance fighters in their huge grasping fists.  In a continuous CGI-generated shot lasting several minutes toward the beginning, we follow John Connor as he takes over a helicopter, flies it into the air, then ultimately crash lands.  By the end of the exhilarating sequence, my head felt like one of the trademark crushed human skulls present in every one of the movies.  Gone are the days of shoestring-budget effects and multiple crushed AMC Gremlins.

Unfortunately the trend of the Terminator movies has been to progressively move toward the Holy Grail of Big Budget Special Effects and away from well-told and soul-stirring science fiction, which, at its best, explores the pesky troubles that result from humans being ourselves and then being forced to solve our moral dilemmas which are inevitably of our own making.

On a perhaps not totally conscious level, we respond to the Terminator movies because we recognize our times.  The original movie tapped into Cold War dread and fear over the formidable reach of the Evil Empire.  T2 was right for an optimistic time of glasnost.  The third installment fit into the current age of terrorism, with an ""the enemy was within"" denouement.  The message of the latest is, I don't know...Skynet could afford massive armaments by leveraging L.A. real estate?

Watching Terminator Salvation is a lot like riding a roller coaster ride: thrilling while it's going on, but over when it's over.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, intricate battle scenes and mind-blowing spectacle can't replace basic concern for characters.  In the end I wasn't allowed to care nearly as much as I wanted to.

Admittedly, the bar is high, but that's why movie makers earn the big bucks.  Hopefully next time there's no ""MCG"" turning the franchise into fast food ""McTerminator"" movies.  We fans can only hope that when the Terminator installment next comes back, it is more Harlan Ellison and less Harley Davidson.

Grade: C

Some of Dreamer Action Figure's other scribblings can be found on My Space.  ""Terminator Salvation: Rise of the Deus Ex Machina"" was originally titled, ""Salvation from the Trend in the Terminator Movies, Please"" and was written after reading a couple of reviews of other films written by a friend in his local newspaper.  It's become something of a tradition for me and one of my brothers to see the latest Terminator movie on the day it comes out.  I suspected something was afoot when we arrived more than thirty minutes early in anticipation of the crowd and walked into a totally empty theater.",1243036800,2,5855,5.0
3579168,4,B001FB55I0,"A lot of people seem to want to hate this film and I can understand that people are basing it off the great precident set forth by the first two films, but if you go into a movie with the expectation it will be bad than you will not be pleased no matter what you see on the screen. I love the first two films and consider them the only part of the franchise that contribute to the actual lore of the Terminator world created by James Cameron. This movie is the first movie that actually shows us the future that Sarah was so valiantly trying to prevent.

Let me start off by proposing something in terms of the storyline in this film. This film takes place, supposedly, before John Connor sends Kyle Reese back in time to save his mother and in effect concieve John. If this is the case, I do not think we should be seeing a fully developed leader in John Connor at this point, which we don't. Christian Bale gives a solid performance, despite his cold demeanor and lack of ability to control the situation, despite having his mother's advice. The movie is clearly the setup for at least one more film, possibly two(depending on the gross) and is a very good starting point.

The effects are just outstanding in the film, to say the least. I actually enjoyed very much that they started this film with the ""lumbering hulk"" T-800's as the primitive Terminators instead of jumping right into a realm of something much more advanced. If you're planning more films, you can't throw out your best material in the first film, you just can't, so I understand the logic. The HK's are great, but the best on-screen behemoth is by far the massive 4-5 story tall Termninator(I want to say they are called Chimera, or were in Cameron's versions possibly). I actually thought they did a pretty good job sending the impression of danger, especially thanks to the sound effects, and I felt like it was hopeless for anyone to escape the thing. The cinematography is quit gripping at certain points, such as the scene on the outskirts of a Resistance base that involves a burning treeline, a helicopter crash, and a nice scene done in a nearby pool of water. Even the scenes involving air combat are quite well done and do not go over the top at all, they run at a pace that is completelly realistic and exciting at the same time. The sets and imagery used for the film are all very well done I think, much moreso than a post-apocalyptic film like Resident Evil 3. They use a slight grain fliter in the camera work, but it is never overbearing. It is varied as well as shown in the final section of the film that takes place in an environment that is juxtaposed to the bleak wastelands that the Resistance calls home.

I think the main thing to consider in this film is the timeline in which it takes place. As odd as it is, this film presents less advanced technology in terms of the termninators and weapons used by the resistance than the first two, but I think it is done for continuity to keep with the idea that this is not yet the future where Connor is shown in T2.

There are certainly a couple of instances in the film that bugged me in terms of believablity, but they are minor enough for them to not ruin the rest of the film for me. The story could have been fleshed out somewhat more, but again, this isn't meant to be the endall of the franchise and I don't expect them to reinvent the wheel in terms of what the story actually is. There is a story in this film, and it is given to you in fair doses and paced well between action sequences. To say there is no story in the film is rather ignorant. Story is dilemma and John Connor most certinaly has a large Dilemma in the film. There can be no film without a story and this film is no different.

This film will please many action film lovers as it is a great one, but it is not just an ""action film"". It is what you make of it folks and I went in with an open mind and left the theater(as did my wife) loving the film for what it was. The film could never outdo T2, not many can, but this is a different time for filmmaking and it is done well within those confines. I am actually quite excited for the next film and hope they up the anty quite a bit in both story and visual effects, but only time will tell.",1243036800,,4259,4.285714285714286
3579169,5,B001FB55I0,"The typical Terminator movie, this one begins at the Longview Correctional Facility in 2003 where a death-row prisoner is being asked to donate his body to a noble cause.

Fast-forward to year 2018.  There is destruction everywhere as we see John Conner and the Resistance fighting off the human-hating terminator robots, which are manufactured by Skynet Labs.  In this flick, John Conner meets his father Conner Reed.

Of course, I cannot tell you any more about the storyline, other than it's the usual Resistance vs. Terminators.  The Terminators (Ts) are bad and big and some are bigger than big, including flying Ts and Ts on motorcycles. As usual, it's hard as heck to stop them or kill them.  Some of them keep getting up for awhile.  The objective is to put Skynet Labs out of business and kill off the Ts, but after 2 T movies, we know that ain't so easily done.

The movie has almost non-stop action and it gets pretty intense.  The whole concept about these big scary robots taking over and killing humanity is not a good concept for children to watch, so I would not take the young and impressionable.

The computer graphic imaging is pretty cool and it takes up a lot of your energy to watch this movie.  It was about 2 to 2 1/2 hours long but enjoyable.  I give it a 5 for the action, graphic imaging, intensity, etc.  The storyline was basic good guys vs. bad guys and the standard T action as in the first 2 Ts.  Thoroughly enjoyable on the big screen.",1243036800,2,1468,4.511363636363637
3579170,5,B001FB55I0,"Before I ramble on about franchises and time travel and the cool visuals of a metal humanoid trying to kill you, let me just say this: If you are a fan of Terminators, see this movie.  See it before other reviewers spoil it. GO!

Still here?  Sigh.  This review is spoiler free, but you're bound to see something on the Internet or on television. Don't say I didn't warn you...

One of the reasons the Terminator series is so popular is that it's a self-selecting franchise.  You either buy into the paradoxical time travel concepts or you don't, consider humanoid killer robots to be the logical evolution of warfare waged against humans or not, believe that the best choice for a killer robot to go undercover is a muscle-bound heavily-accented Austrian or just a lame vehicle for a bodybuilder-turned-actor.  In short, Terminator is more about style and less about logic. The Terminator movies have always made tough choices that are normally movie-suicide: endangering children, killing dogs, lacking a clear lead character, and blithely earning an R rating.  So by the time we reach the fourth installment of the series, it pretty clear that Terminator doesn't care much what you think about it.

Forget time travel.  This movie takes place in a future we aren't entirely familiar with.  Forget Sarah Connor.  She is a mere shadow here, a voice on an old cassette recorder.  Forget the Schwarzenegger you knew - there are no clever robots with marketable catch-phrases.  Terminator Salvation takes place in the midst of a post-apocalyptic struggle to the death between humanity and robots, when Skynet is on the cusp of developing the flesh-shrouded Terminators we know and fear.

There are two main characters: John Connor (Christian Bale) and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington).  Connor is the boy we've watched grow into a man throughout the three previous films; Wright is a murderer given a second lease on life. The two share a common destiny that revolves around the survival of John's future father, the teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin). The difference between the two men unifies the movie as they struggle with the crushing burden of knowledge, about themselves and their own complicated histories/futures.

The special effects are amazing.  The action sequences take your breath away.  Terminators of all stripes from all three movies make an appearance, along with a cadre of all new clanking monstrosities. There are nods to the older films, from the way certain characters turn their heads after being punched to the music that plays on the few functioning radios.  And for the five of us fans who know that Connor is supposed to have a scar over one eye, we find out how he gets it. The director, McG, is clearly a fan and knows his material.

If the movie has a flaw, it's that Connor isn't really necessary.  Although the entire franchise hinges on his very existence, Wright and Reese steal the show.  Bale mostly screams a lot (and if you're wondering, his recent tirade fits his character quite well) while Worthington struggles to disguise his Aussie accent.  But if you're a fan of the series and already forgiven its many paradoxes, there's nothing in Terminator Salvation that is unforgivable.

Terminator Salvation is indeed the salvation of the franchise.  If you're a fan, see it.  See it now.",1243036800,4,3324,4.942342342342342
3579171,2,B001FB55I0,"I am sad to say Director McG destroyed this franchise. His casting was terrible. Christian Bale is a great edgy character actor. He could not sell the audience he is the kind hearted John Connor. Bale should have been the Terminator. Sam Worthington would have been a better choice as John Connor. McG story telling at best was confusing. The story was all over the place with weak dialog. The visual effects looked great but they did not help tell the story. They actually made it more confusing because most of the time they had no purpose. His many battle scenes went on so long that they became boring. McG put in a lot of nonsense. Example, Connor has a piece of iron the size of a 2x4 plunged in to his chest that protrudes out his back. The next scene he is on the operating table looking like he was there for a yearly check up and the doctor say I think he has a bad heart. The movie is bad, boring, ridiculous and a big disappointment. Not even a good rental.",1243036800,6,969,4.300546448087432
3579172,3,B001FB55I0,"Hollywood has a habit of rebooting successful franchises, and it seems like the next one on the list is James Cameron's ""Terminator"" franchise. I have always wondered how the futuristic apocalyptic world of this sci-fi franchise would look like and as to how humans are able to survive and keep a ""resistance"". Having the rare distinction of being both a prequel and a sequel, ""TERMINATOR SALVATION"" attempts to give us that vision. The film pretty much takes off after where Jonathan Mostow's underappreciated ""Rise of the Machines"" and takes place many years after Cameron's original.

2018. John Connor (Christian Bale) is an tired soldier in a war against the killing machine-hordes of Skynet. Using tapes left behind by his deceased mother Sarah Connor (voiced by Linda Hamilton), he tries to piece together clues to their future and how everything is tied to the past. Some people see John as some prophet, and he has managed to gain the confidence of many soldiers, including a teenager named John Reese (Anton Yelchin) who is also John's father. After a skirmish between the resistance fighters and machines in a desolate area, a man named Marcus (Sam Worthington) is freed. He was a ruthless killer executed sometime ago, and who has now regained consciousness. Wandering in the wasteland which was formerly L.A., Marcus befriends Kyle who points him to the direction of the resistance movement. Kyle becomes captured and marked for execution, as Marcus meets John Connor. But Marcus is a lot more than he seems to be, and the fate of humanity is now at risk.

The Terminator franchise is a series that is essentially an action-packed chase film that was thrilling, and manages to expose the heart of human drama in the face of a potentially horrific future. It was brilliantly simple, its creator James Cameron and then director Jonathan Mostow's renditions carried the same scent and mechanics. Well, this time around, director McG, is a odd choice since his less than impressive resume includes the abysmal ""Charlie's Angels"". The world of 2018, is not too much to be understood as it is to be experienced. ""Terminator Salvation"" chronicles man's fight for survival ruled by machines and intelligent computers. The direction is very uneven and presents a lot of inconsistencies in its existing groundwork. What's more, the film relies on the impression that whoever would be watching this film is a fan, as it abandons a lot of characterization.

The moody and brooding monochromatic world of ""Salvation"", is something different from Cameron's set groundwork of night executed guerilla warfare, where humans are left in the underground on the brink of extinction. Keep in mind that this film occurs in the early days of the resistance (the early models of the T-600) and this time around, there are quite a good number of survivors in this dried up barren world. The screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris is very inconsistent and proves to be a little too hollow. (Not surprising, since these two are responsible for ""Catwoman"") The script introduces certain aspects, that seem quite viable but then abandoned. The script felt a little too rushed and lacked a careful methodical approach. It seemed like they were relying on the audience to fill in the plot gaps, such as why the machines were taking prisoners, or as to how the resistance seem to be well-supplied in armament and provisions--they have aircraft and submarines. It would have been easy to give subtle hints that humans are needed as slaves to maintain the machines or to use their organic skin for the newer T-800 models, and that the supplies were stolen, that there were military lines of communication left in the world; But none of these were brought into exposition. I thought Cameron's world gave the impression that humanity was all but wiped out, with very few survivors. The direction relies on the audiences to find explanations, and leaves us to our assumptions. A little effort in plot details and characterization would've helped. The direction exhibited ignorance to this successful sci-fi franchise.

The film is also promoted as a film about John Connor but it carried a more steady diet on Marcus and even borrows elements from ""Ghost in the Shell"" and maybe even the ""Matrix"". The concept of what makes a human is quite interesting, but it was a little unnecessary. Marcus was human to begin with, despite his alterations to machine parts. He has his own organic parts, and still has the human essentials. The idea of him becoming a `sleeper' terminator carries little merit as a machine who thinks himself human. In this installment, the machines have risen to the point as being more interesting than their human counterparts. What's more, McG never fleshes out the idea of the duality of man and machine, the potential combustive merging of man and machine, Marcus' character would've been interesting if guided by more competent direction. Bale takes a backseat to Worthington and the Connor character was almost left with nothing but to play a supporting role. The cast is a little uneven, but I cannot really blame them given the small things they had to work with. I was real pleased to see Moon Bloodgood, she was a sight for sore eyes.

Amid all the plot mistakes and blunders, McG attempts to flood our minds with explosions and very cool scenes of battle. Yes, the film does have a good number of  ""Man Vs. Machine"" confrontations. The machines this time around looked very inventive, as to how they mimic common military strategies and firepower. There are terminator motorbikes (idea probably taken from ""Robotech""), a huge tank-like robot ( which looked like a refugee from Michael Bay`s ""Transformers""), a carrier aircraft, and we see glimpses of the T-600, the slow earlier generation terminator. Oh, we also get to see the newer generation T-800 and a CGI-generated ""Anuld"" makes a short appearance. The battle scenes are cool to watch but they are hardly epic, since they are too short and barely carried any emotional impact. Still, the action sequences were thrilling enough and may be enough to give the movie hyper-kinetic momentum, to compensate for the clumsy storytelling.

Now, is ""Terminator Salvation"" worthy of a nod from Cameron? Well, probably not. The film's storytelling is clumsy and uninspired, the film doesn't carry the same metal scent in the other previous films of the franchise. But for a fan of the franchise as I am, I was willing to forgive its shortcomings. At least the franchise is given new life, since I am very disappointed that ""Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles"" was recently confirmed as cancelled.

Recommended! very timidly. [3 - Stars]",1243036800,3,6698,5.000896860986547
3579173,2,B001FB55I0,"Terminator: Salvation was disappointing. It seemed liked everything was worn out,the robots the humans. The weapons were standard like we have now where were the lasers they had in the other T's? Christain Bale seemed angry throughout the whole movie like, is it over yet? The cyborg, Marcus showed more emotion than John Conner. Yes, I did go for the action but, it would have help to have a better storyline. The metal sounds seemed too loud, music did not fit the movie. If they make a next one, maybe it will be better.",1242950400,4,523,4.574468085106383
3579174,4,B001FB55I0,"Christian Bale stars as John Connor in what is now the war against machines. I would have liked if a part for led off from where part 3 ended. We don't get to see how he met other survivors or what led him and Jordan Brewster (Bryce Dallas Howard) to be together romantically. In part 3 they were only told they'd be together in the future. They never actually got together. This movie just starts out with mankind vs machines and Connor and Brewster together. I would have liked a movie that was about where mankind first decided to fight back.

  The movie was at least big summer fun though. McG (Charlies Angels) did a much better direction job than I expected. I also liked the plot where John Connor is trying to find Kyle Reese before the Terminators can. They plan to kill him so John is never born. But a lot of the good stuff was mostly done with Sam Worthington's character. We get to know his character and he's the one we feel for. He's also the one involved in some of the films better action sequences. Bale is a good actor but he really didn't have a lot to work with. In the movie Connor basically just barks orders, gives pep talks on the radio and listens to tapes of his mother. Worthington had the more engaging character.

  While the relationship between Connor and Brewster could have been built up a lot better. We just know that they are now a couple. They don't talk about what led them to falling in love. I doubt they just did because Arnold told them they would. Here we just know they're in love because they kiss and hug. Bale and Howard barely get have enough time together to even form any kind of chemistry. I did like how Anton Yelchin was used as Kyle though. He at least kind of looked like a young Michael Biehn. The little girl that played his mute friend was good too. I even cared about their fate more than I did Connor's.

  I need to say more positive stuff about the movie since it sounds like I didn't like it. I really really enjoyed it as a summer movie. As a Terminator movie it could have been better. But as a summer movie it was a ton of fun and it had plenty of excitement. It was at least a much better film than part 3 and it was a Terminator film that was different for once. All the others had similar plots with the heroes on the run through the whole movie. I don't get why some people say this one is all action and no brains. I actually found it to be a little smarter and more original, well more than part 3 at least. I think part 3 was the one that was basically all non-stop brainless action. The only new thing part 3 offered was the surprise ending.",1242950400,3,2617,4.218
3579195,3,B001FB55I0,"I went to see Terminator: Salvation with an open mind, even while knowing that most reviews have been harsh. I admire what James Cameron did with the first two films in the series and they are easily 5 star classics. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines had some good parts, but it was a failure when compared to what came before it. The same goes here for the fourth movie in the franchise, though I think it's a little better. Sure the SFX and action scenes are very good, but it's the writing, acting and character developement that Salvation lacks. There is some really bad dialogue being thrown around and it didn't wow me even once. Christian Bale isn't as bad here as some critics are saying, but he doesn't make John Connor into anything special. Sam Worthington does the most here in terms of making you care about him, but that is mainly due to the fact that he is the more interesting character of the bunch because of what he is. I'll admit that it was cool seeing the famous T-800 design again on the BIG screen and Arnold in the flesh, even though it looks like he was just cut in from the first Terminator film and cleaned up using CGI.

I left the theater thinking that Terminator: Salvation was just one explosion after another courtesy of director McG and nothing more. This vision of the future is a far cry from the small glimpses we got in The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Too bad, because what James Cameron started and perfected in 1984 and 1991, is now nothing more than mindless popcorn entertainment.",1242950400,3,1539,4.516129032258065
3579196,2,B001FB55I0,"In a bleak future robots turn on their makers and seek to destory all mankind.  It's a great idea: a frightening concept that lingers in the back of our minds in this technologically driven world: Mankind becoming obsolete. Unfortunatly, so are dinosaurs like me, who remember the greatness of the first two films, because this movie is clearly directed at the teen crowd (PG-13).

To review, the Terminator had two wonderful entries and then hit a snag  without James Cameron behind the wheel.  Fans were led to believe that this film would alleviate that problem.  I'm here to say it did not.  That being said, if you enjoyed T3 Rise of the Machines go no further with this review.  You will like this newest entry to the Terminator mythos.  However, if you are harkening for a return to what made the first two movies great I'm sad to say this is not your movie.

For years I've been wanting to see a Terminator movie set in the future.  When I heard there was one coming out and that John Connor would be played by Christian Bale, like many fans I was stoked. Sadly, this film equates nothing more than another pointless entry to the Terminator saga.  There are several reasons for this.

Firstly, Salvation includes yet another Terminator sidekick.  Wow...that is an original idea!(The cyborg sidekick has already been done T2, T3 and the Sarah Connor Chronicals TV series)  This time it is Marcus, an inmate science experiment turned into a cyborg. However, director McG (who sounds like an item of the McDonalds dollar menu) tries to suprise you with the news that Marcus is a Terminator but fails, because we see Marcus donate his body to Cyberdyne systems in the first five minutes.  To make things worse, Marcus ends up being a more interesting character than Bale's Bruce Way.....I mean John Connor.

Secondly, the score doesn't sound right.  We all know what the Terminator should sound like.  Brad Fiedel's score in the opening of T2 has a haunting and machine like drone.  Indeed the whole film has a distinct sound.  You know it's Terminator.  He doesn't feel pity or remorse, and he will not stop ever...until you are dead!  Unfortunatly, Danny Elfman's score sounds more Gotham City than bleak post apocalyptic future to me.  That isn't suprising considering Mr. Elfman has done brilliant work scoring Batman related material (Batman 1989 and Batman the Animated Series just to name a few).  However, I found his Terminator score lacking.

My third gripe with the film is the disregard for the future established  cannon of the first three films. Immediatly you will notice a total lack of energy weapons both by Terminators and their human counterparts.  Fanboys know that the Terminator endoskeleton is heavily armored.  Yet, everyone is using convential gas operated small arms (AR-15, Shotgun, Beretta 9mm, colt .45 etc).  As Arnold would say in his best Austrian accent...BIG MISTAKE!  After all, flashback sequences in the early films highlight resistance fighters using plasma rifles and energy based weapons to combat the machines.  When Kyle is asked by Sarah in Terminator (1984) ""Can you stop it"" he responds, ""I don't know...with these weapons...I don't know.""  So where are the energy weapons?  People will say I'm nitpicking here, but this isn't some minor hiccup.  This is a major major mistake.

What happens when you shoot a Terminator with bullets?  Let us review shall we.  Take for example the police station scene in 1984's Terminator.  A lone T-800 walks into a police station and wipes out all the police officers who are shooting him with newsflash...gas operated projectile weapons!  Flash forward to 1991...the Terminator again gets peppered with small arms fire by a swat team and suffers little more than cosmetic damage.  Even in the dreadful T3 this concept is adhered to.  Yet, this film expects us to forget all that and just accept that standard small arms are effective against the machines.  Who made the call on the decision to eliminate plasma weapons?  If big action sequences were all they were going for plasma fire would have looked really cool in this movie.  I can see the teenagers now...wow, look at the pretty lights...ohhhhhhhh!

Next on the list of complaints is a crappy CGI Arnold Schwartzenegger cameo.  Yeah, it looks pretty crappy (like a cutscene in a videogame).  I suppose it's better than the rubber faced Arnold cutting out his eyeball in the 84 Terminator but it still looks goofy.  The kids will love it.

Everyone looks clean, goodlooking, and all around too happy.  Besides an occasional machine here or there, the future doesn't look so bad.
I mean where are the Terminators?  There is only one in L.A.  There are like six in the whole movie, including a five story high Deceptacon from the Tranformers movie (not a joke), and where did the resistance get A-10s, hueys, and submarines? The future doesn't seem bleak enough.

Final verdict: The acting is sufficient, but the script is junk, and everyone is too pretty. Atomic holocost doesn't look so bad.  If you wanted to see hundreds of terminators fightning hundreds of soldiers (opening sequence of T2) you won't find it here; there isn't a single large scale battle to be had.  It's better than T-3 but that isn't saying much.  Go to a matinee show if you must see it.  It isn't worth full price.",1242950400,11,5331,4.861111111111111
3579197,3,B001FB55I0,"Terminator Salvation gave me a lot of what I was looking for, just not all of it. I won't worry too much about ""spoilers"" since if you've seen a commercial or even the toy isle you probably know about any ""twists"" already.

A lot of what I was looking for was action and there is plenty of well done action here. Our characters are confronted by cyborgs new and old (old being a relative term).  There are flying hunter killers, the mean and scary T-600 (who was one of my favorites), hydro terminators, motorcycle terminators, giant terminators and our old friend T-800.  There are machines all over the place and that was the point.  Our resistance soldiers have plenty to shoot at and blow up.  The chases and action are all well done and all effects, CG or not, are eye poppingly sharp and exciting.

People may complain about plot.  I'm not too worried about that for my summer action flick.  Earlier Terminator movies had simple plots too (terminator tries to kill someone, get away from terminator with help).  Here we see John Conner working with the resistance as a soldier (not leader yet).  He meets a man named Marcus Wright who donated his body to science before being executed who turns out to be (spoiler twist that you probably know) a terminator who may or may not be programmed to lure John into a trap.  John also hears of his young father, Kyle Reese, and is eager to meet the guy and make sure he is safe.  And he wants to blow up some T-800's before they make life even harder.

However, what the earlier Terminator movies had that this one doesn't is development. They might have been simple plots but we learned about our characters, their world, their future and their motivations.  Not so much here.  Sure Marcus is conflicted that he is now a cyborg and there is some ham fisted attempt at the question of ""what is free will / what does it mean to be a man?""  Other than that we simply move from one action scene to the next taking us inevitably to where we knew we were going all along.

I would love to have seen development of the dark world from the earlier films with giant rolling terminators on fields of skulls, battalions of T-700's (or maybe T-600's) blasting away, kids watching fire in a TV set but maybe all of that is still in the future.  Also, none of the terminator movies ever sold me on the fact that John Connor is mankind's best hope and this one didn't sell me either and I was hoping it would.  I was hoping to find out why he's so special.  Sure he's tough and rascally but so are plenty of others.  He doesn't seem to be a genius tactician and he didn't start the resistance.  It seems to me that if he died the resistance would just go on. The only reason he's special at all is that he is the prophesied leader of the resistance and that's only because a terminator tried to kill him in the past which means that by trying to kill him Skynet made him the future leader.

But the movie was fun.  The action was great and there was a cool cameo and fun little line drops.  Some may feel that dropping an, ""I'll be back,"" in is corny or condescending but it's all in good fun really.

So the movie is fun and exciting and action packed and is definitely worth watching.  It just doesn't develop or add to the world like I'd hoped. After the excitement wore off and I had time to think that's what disappointed me.",1242950400,3,3364,4.357945425361156
3579198,3,B001FB55I0,"I really, really wished someone else would have written this movie. There were a lot of things wrong with Terminator Salvation, but this is coming from a person who has watched the prior three installments and the television series. To the average young movie watcher who doesn't know the entire cast of characters in John Connor's story, this film will come off as a mediocre sci-fi action thriller with a confusingly weak story.

Taking place after a Nuclear blast has wiped out much of the human race, John Connor (now a grizzled war vet) is one of the leaders of a revolutionary underground movement hell bent on taking back the earth from their machine masters. In the first two Terminator movies we are given a bit of history on this John Connor, how he loved people, how his selflessness and bravado was enough to make them forget their fears and fight back against the zerg. What I saw in Christian Bale's version of John Connor was a hardened loner-type, showing little to no emotion aside from the few times he was with his pregnant wife. This version did not feel like the leader we were made to believe led the revolution, he just lacked the sort of charisma that you would expect a guy like that to hold. He did not go through the ranks touching men on their shoulders and giving the fighters that reassuring eye to let them know he has their back... the tiny hints that a viewer looks for to confirm their belief that this man was their saviour, just weren't there. No, John seemed cold, too cold, his decisions were not democratic, his beliefs are dashed aside at a whim and he seems to have no recollection of his youth (Terminaor 2: Judgement Day) when a machine taught him to think and not allow blind hate to cloud his judgement. This John Connor has a deep hate for the machines and it is reinforced by an ancient tape recorder that plays his mother's instructions from the past. This wrong John Connor ruined it movie for me because he is the protagonist, yet his story, visage, and history are so wrong that it was hard to look past him and like the movie.

The story of Terminator Salvation felt like the piecing together of three different scripts being that it started out very well and ended up going nowhere fast. In the past movies we were led to believe that Skynet was so advanced and powerful, the only way out for the human race was to send someone back in the past to stop it from even starting. The Skynet we see in this movie is advanced... at building cool machines and motorcycles (that lack any real AI). To recall Arnold's T-800 relentlessly doing detective work and searching for Sarah Connor in the first Terminator to seeing the T-600s in this movie (the obvious future of it all) walking blindly and being outsmarted by children, just didn't make sense whatsoever. Hell the explosions were pretty but I had absolutely no fear of the machine menace that ruled the world. This is not how I felt in the older movies. Remember how hopeless it seemed when the T-1000 chased the Connor family in T2, how it seemed nothing could stop it? It made you say to yourself, ""damn! How would you deal with 10 of those things if you can't even handle one in this movie!?"" Well somehow McG and crew forgot this tiny element because the dumb machines and clueless T-600 models are laughably bad at tracking anything.

Through all the horrible and forgettable writing that plagued this letdown, the best parts were the scenes with Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) and Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Not so much the chemistry, but the fact that they had the least annoying scenes in the entire thing. The action scenes which had Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and John Connor (Christian Bale) seemed to be full of the most unrealistic coincidences to fall in their favor. The story behind Marcus Wright was probably the most interesting and would have benefited the movie if they delved into his past a bit more. The conflict in screen time between him and Connor did not flow well and it would have been better if they stayed with him and ditched Connor altogether.

In closing I will say that Terminator Salvation was pretty but lacking in substance, relevance and ultimately reason. There is nothing to be learned from this one and it neither wraps up the saga nor adds anything to it. The story was a huge waste of time and a disappointment. Moon Bloodgood was deliciously hot though... I will give it that... but only that.",1242950400,5,4448,4.605296343001261
3579199,3,B001FB55I0,"What is this movie trying to do? I understand the concept, both as a separate entity and as a piece of the narrative puzzle started by James Cameron back in 1984. But really, what is ""Terminator Salvation"" all about? Is it genuinely trying to expand on a very well established story, or is it delivering the exact same product in a visually stunning new package? You'd think watching a movie about events that have already been explained would be a lot of fun, but somehow, it feels incredibly tedious. Maybe that's why it never seemed like it was getting to the point, and I'm hard pressed to say that there even was a point to get to. Whereas the original ""Terminator"" films were driven by clever, carefully constructed plots, this new film seems almost entirely driven by mindless action. This would be fine for the average summer blockbuster, but when you're talking about continuing a richly developed science fiction fable, there needs to be something more.

The story takes place after Judgment Day in the year 2018, a time when the super intelligent machines designed by Skynet have taken over the world. Entire cities lie in ruins. Governments have collapsed. Much of humanity has been ... well, terminated. Many of those that survived have banded together to form The Resistance, which includes a grown up John Conner (Christian Bale), who has been prophesized to end the war between humans and machines. As he listens to a series of cassette tapes recorded by his late mother, he's made aware that he must seek out and protect his father, Kyle Reese. You will recall that John was conceived when Kyle travelled back to the 1980s to protect Sarah Conner from a Terminator machine. Within the context of ""Terminator Salvation,"" Kyle is younger than his own son--a teenager (Anton Yelchin) who travels around with a mute little girl named Star (Jadagrace).

It seems that Skynet is rounding up a number of survivors and taking them to their headquarters near San Francisco. Knowing that Kyle is among them, John insists on a search-and-rescue operation. His commander, the stubborn General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), refuses to let that happen--the way he sees it, human lives are not as important as destroying Skynet once and for all. This puts John in a very uncomfortable position, not only because he has to leave his pregnant wife, Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), but also because he has to trust someone he may be incapable of trusting.

This, I understand, is made strictly for entertainment purposes. And yet, for an inherently entertaining premise, I was surprised at how boring the film ended up being. There are, for instance, virtually no interesting characters. This unfortunately goes double for John Conner; since we already know him and what his mission in life is, I found it very hard to look past the clich image of the troubled hero. Not even the explosions--and there are many of them--are enough to pique interest, probably because audiences have come to expect them from movies like this. But isn't it always better when the special effects work with the story and not in spite of it? This film, like so many that have come before it, is more concerned with the way it looks than it is with how it plays.

There is, in fact, only one plot point that held my interest, and fortunately, it coincides with the film's only interesting character. I'm referring to Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), a former convicted felon. In spite of what the ads for this movie give away, I'll spare you a detailed description of him in the hope that you'll end up being surprised. I will tell you that his very being poses fascinating questions about what really makes us human. He also has a few great scenes. One is at the very beginning with Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), who isn't as clear-cut a character as you might think. The others involve a Resistance fighter named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), tough on the outside but not altogether incapable of caring.

The rest of ""Terminator Salvation,"" alas, is comprised of vehicle chases and shootouts and things blowing up and more chases. Its basic shot consists of a rusty-looking Terminator skeleton being shot in the head, and the camera lingers for a moment to let us watch its glowing red eyes fade to black. Extra time is also reserved for references to the old films, including the lines ""Come with me if you want to live,"" and ""I'll be back."" (""Hasta la vista, baby,"" strangely enough, is left out.) Even the ending tips its hat at its predecessors, taking place in a factory.

As for Christian Bale, he proves once again that he's a glutton for punishment, his role so physically demanding, his American accent so meticulously impersonated, his personality so distant and brooding. I think I've gotten tired of watching Bale play such dreary characters. Honestly, can't someone cast him in a comedy? He's a good actor--I'm sure he can be funny. Here, he's just giving us more of the same. His rendition of John Conner may in fact be more robotic than anything done by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course, since the story isn't in the least bit interesting, it doesn't allow for the development of any character. So it may be a moot point. ""Terminator Salvation"" is very likely to appeal to the fans of the film series, and if you happen to be one of them, then I'm sorry. For my money, this movie played like a listless and generic visual aid for special effects and stunts.",1242864000,,5459,4.79596174282678
3579200,5,B001FB55I0,"Terminator Salvation easily defeats Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines in just about every phase possible, but especially in pure action.

Salvtion pays homage over and over to the past Terminator films ranging from the the Guns N' Roses song in T2, to the exact way the Terminator walks up the stairs in T1, and even the nuclear fuel cells in T3.

Christopher Bale is fantastic as John Connor, and a huge step up from the Connor people saw in T3.

Anton Yelchin is dead on in his impression of a young Kyle Reese and Sam Worthington is a name that is surely on the rise with his portrayl of Marcus Wright, a new breed of Terminator.

From the opening scene to the final, Terminator Salvtion is breath-taking, very loud, and very full of action.

The camera work used in Terminator Salvation is amazing, including the helicopter scene in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

Salvation covers the stories of a young and rising through the ranks John Connor, the people's champ, a young Kyle Reese who has no idea how important he is, and Marcus Wright, who last remembers being executed only to find himself in the year 2018, in the land of the Terminators.

I know Terminator Salvation has gotten a bad rap, but most of it came from fans who had a prejudice against McG for being the director, but ignore them and check out Terminator Salvation.

and one more thing, yes Arnold does appear. His appearence doesn't last long, but his impact is definetly made and felt, and Terminator Salvation is sure to do the same.",1242864000,,1514,4.5814814814814815
3579201,2,B001FB55I0,"John Connor's character, and the entire movie, is built around the idea that human compassion and love is what makes us better than the machines.  The hybrid Terminator played by Sam Worthington saves John Connor and Kyle Reese from death.  John Connor is mortally wounded and needs a heart.  The hybrid Terminator has a human heart, and offers it to John Connor.  Connor accepts the heart, presumably leading to the death of the hybrid.  This one scene ruined the entire movie for me, and made a lie out of John Connor's entire ethos.  The John Connor I know would not take the life of another human to save his own.

The movie lacked the nerve racking suspense of the first two that left you exhausted.  It was very predictable, and most of the movie I felt like I was watching Transformers 3, not Terminator 4.  The director McG just does not get the Terminator Universe.  I hope he Will Not be Back.",1242864000,2,903,4.518518518518518
3579202,4,B001FB55I0,"The Terminator movies are basically chase movies, the terminator(s) chasing John or Sarah Connor while they try to chase down Skynet. but the open ended format of the Terminator series has given the franchise a resilience, and within the mythology created is able to use themes of what makes one either human or a machine. Terminator Salvation develops this more than the other movies in the series, focusing more on the human aspects instead of just a hunt.

Christian Bale plays the adult John Connor, but he's not exactly where we thought he'd be when we last saw him. He isn't the head of the resistance, he's close but he's taking orders from others and it seems to chafe at him that he isn't being listened to. On one mission he infiltrates a Cyberdyne laboratory where he discovers the plans to a new terminator series, the T-800 (the Arnold Schwarzenegger model) and he inadvertently releases a new type of cyborg.

Sam Worthington play Marcus Wright, a death row prisoner executed before judgment day, but he donated his body to science in the hopes he might do some good in the world. When he wakes up in 2018 he doesn't realize he's changed, he's no longer human, or is he? Is he following his free will or responding to programming?

Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor isn't given a lot to do except stand around looking matronly (she's pregnant), and be pretty, for some reason she's wearing a lot of make-up that seems a little out of place during an all encompassing war. She isn't even given as much to do as Claire Danes did in Rise of the Machines. Christian Bale plays John Connor as a pretty hard man but even hard men have tender moments with loved ones and Howard's character should  have been the softening agent for Bale to play against. Even Marcus Wright has a more active love interest in Moon Bloodgood (which is a name that sounds lifted from a vampire novel) than John and Kate Connor do.

The resistance is planning to attack the main outpost of Skynet in San Francisco but Connor discovers that Kyle Reese (his future father) is there and along with Marcus Wright mounts a rescue mission against the orders of the resistance. Anton Yelchin plays Kyle Reese and is a much better in this role than he was in Star Trek, as an effete Mr. Chekov.

Helena Bonham Carter gets to play both ends of the spectrum. At the beginning of the movie she plays a scientist that you have real sympathy for, and at the end she reveals what Marcus Wright's mission was and she seems the evil incarnation of Skynet itself.

The usual mistake of sequels is they try to reproduce the original movie, Salvation doesn't make that mistake, there are no punchy phrases like ""I'll be back"" (even though it's quickly alluded to) or ""hasta la vista baby."" At moments the movie seems a hybrid of other movies. Aspects or portions of this movie have influences from Frankenstein, Road Warrior, The Matrix, Transformers, and even The Great Escape. But this isn't a clumsy attempt of trying to stitch a movie together with the left over parts of other movies, Salvation uses those parts to fit into the Terminator world.

Terminator Salvation is well worth seeing and spending your money on.",1242864000,3,3189,4.6518650088809945
3579203,5,B001FB55I0,"this film fits logically into the Terminator mythology, everything they told us about post-judgment day and what john connor would be like seemed very natural. the production design, special effects and action scenes are all excellent. the acting and charecters are pretty wooden and thats where the film falters. coming off of the intense characterization of tvs Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, its sorely missed. its not a perfect film but its dark and thrilling and its great to finally see the real war of the machines.",1242864000,3,532,5.126436781609195
3579204,5,B001FB55I0,"I went last night with a buddy of mine to see the premiere of Terminator: Salvation, and let me just say we were both blown away! Coming in to the theater I was worried about were this series is going, specially after reading several reviews off Rottentomatoes site, and the reviews are not all that good. But after seeing this movie, I hope this new director can make another, if possible. You know, going into the film, and if you have seen all three previous alterations of Terminator, you should pretty much have the plot, although sometimes confusing, already figured out. There's a sneering little snippet on audio tape when Sarah Conner is verbally trying to explain to John Conner, the resistance leader, that trying to figure out time chronologically can be a massive headache, or something to that nature. I thought that was timely well put under the circumstances. But if you have watched Terminator 3, you can pretty much guess the next installment would easily take place into the future! And my Golly is about time. I remember watching the first Terminator in the theater, in complete awe, and more so whenever Kyle Reece had his flash backs. Every time the movie set you up into that time frame, it was like watching a whole new world unfolding before your eyes, and futhermore, you wanted to see more. It was a world familiar, but turned up side down as you had machines taking over the world. The plot was believable, familiar to the average viewer with every day events, and one could sense the gloom of humanity as we head into the future. That was then, and today, when you see Salvation, you will appreciate the level of detail leading up to Terminator 4. Personally, in my eyes, the first was the best, with a second being more of a recycle of the first, with pumped up special effects and a few added touches of advancing the story line. Part three was the most advance in the series that, again, advance the story line just enough to lead you up to the future, and again, part three was in its own rhythem an interesting take on the series, and only advancing it just enough for another sequel. Well, I'm starting to suspect the terminator series is going to be a long series, as these film companies are only pinching the plot very slowly, so they can get back and deliver another several years down the line. I'm ok with that, as I had yet to see a bad terminator flick, and every one of them have always been a true enjoyment in the theaters. When you pay, 9-10 dollars for your ticket, you'll feel coming out of it you got every penny spent. The set pieces, action, and overall look of the film is amazingly well put together, and the long-drawn out action sequences are some of the best kenetic explosions you'll see on the big screen. For the entertainment value alone, Salvation will not disappoint. It delivers in bucket loads. Nonstop action from beginning to end. The director wants it in your face, rub it in, and have enough of it that you come out the theater with bruises you can feel the next day. The audio, coupled with the explosions will rock and vibrate your seat 'till you drop your panties.

  Now story wise, there's a twist with one of the characters in the film that actually works, even though you suspect there's something wrong from the beginning, the story unfolds and at the end the revelation is worthwhile and the twist is filling for an otherwise thin plot. Without this twist, you really don't have much to go on to advance the story line, after all, the last three films delved deeply into the plot and psycho-babble, and all you got really left is the scraps littered in the battlefield. The fourth installment dwells into the future, and after knowing everything heading into this film, there's not a whole lot a director can do to advance it, without running the risk of telling everything. Hence, you'll see another film, perhaps furthering the story  in small bits as usual, and tie some lose ends which the third revealed at the end about john Conners future kids, and so forth.

What I most enjoyed of Salvation?

1)The effects and action sequences are long drawn out, unlike Michael Bays, short, and quick editing. The sequences are matured and advanced so you could see the whole playing field.

2)The machines are vast and clunky, first-generation T-600 series. Moto-terminators are really more of a road killer machine than a walking, breathing cyborg, which you will see in the final action sequence, the T-800. The t-800 was design to infiltrate the human resistance network, which skynet could not penetrate, hence this is a mjor part of the story line in Salvation. Other killer bots are shown, including one that's taller than a two story building, and human-harvesting machines making you think the director is ripping off transformers, and War of the worlds.

Negatives:

1)Thin plot, and character development is lacking. Although I must say, the plot, for what it is, is effective, and well handled.

2)What most amazed me, no battle-scenes of hundreds of terminators were ever shown clump together fighting the resistance. Remember, the beginning of terminator 2? Walking cyborg killers roaming the landscape and terminating the resistance, while they fought back with their heavy guns? You won't see that here. You'll only see flying machines with their search lights seeking humans and destroying them in part 1, 2, and 3. Not part 4. Well, it amazes me the new director did not submit to the same tactics, and decided to shoot a barren landscape of ruble, and crumbled buldings, minus the army of killers wondering and searching for humanity to terminate. Hmm, interesting. I feel he failed to captured that gloom set in stone in parts one through three, and some of the more awe-inspiring elements of the series was missing.

3)Pg-13 rating hurts it, and you can tell, as hardly any humans is cut down in pure blood by the manacing machines. The movie is darker in mood when compared to part three, but the lack of violence hurts this series. Please next installment bring in an R-rating. The movie has punch, blasting action, and killer explosions, but the violence is minimal, and at times it felt like a light terminator flick just to bring in a bigger audience into the theater. I think it cheapens it.

Overall, another great flick. It has its weaknesses, but the overall product delivers in spades for an action junky like me. The story is not bad, and it shows a sprinkle why skynet decided to build more, sophisticated machines, and its continuos plot to terminate humanity. If it was not for the twist in Salvation, this movie would have fallen completely flat on its face. And this is another problem heading into another sequel. How do you create a protoganist without ruining skynet as the adversary? The director needs a star, and skynet needs another Arnold to build at least a descent story line without just falling into the same trap of fighting nameless/faceless machines, which in all purposes the audience is not going to relate or feel attached to again as the fourth already accomplished. We need an adversary that's hooked up to Skynet, and deliver its commands and phylosophy on the battlefield. One that can communicate and talk,and describe in its own words what it wants to achieve; its goals, its dreams, its awareness! If skynet did became aware, than it must think, and thereby, it must find its own solution to its ends. We need something like this in another Terminator. I want to know what the machines are plotting, its schemes, its awareness. I want to know if it can feel, and grow, and understand its scope of madness. In Terminator 2, the cyborg actually was learning how to be human, at least to some degree, it was hacked, but its computing power led it to grow as it communicated with Jonn Conner. I sure miss moments like that in Salvation. You can call it souless, heartless, or whatever, but watching through Salvation, you often wanted more of a soul on both sides of the fence. Anyhow, go see it for the spectacle that it is, and remember, Salvation is just the beginning.",1242864000,4,8102,4.713983050847458
