1675219,5,B00005Y7GQ,This is an awsome movie from Stephen Chow.  Visually it's pleasing to the creative eyes.  Sound separation is much better than most Hong-Kong-originated movies.  Must See!!!!,1015459200,,174,5.615384615384615
1675220,5,B00005Y7GQ,"Stephen Chow has made one of the finest comedies ever to come from Hong Kong. A supreme blend of Kung Fu action, excellent special effects, cracking gags, visual hilarity and lets not forget soccer! It all adds up to Grandstand meets Matrix meets Tom & Jerry.
Although it is heavily laden with special effects these in no way hinder the movie, they only serve to add and reinforce it. This is a rare occasion where they could have had more special effects.
If you want to see a unique comedy, then look no further than Shaolin Soccer! PS. See the directors cut on DVD, for some reason some of the funniest jokes were cut out?",1015027200,2,625,4.443478260869565

1675227,5,B00005Y7GQ,"Beyond hilarious !!!! Stephen Chow is by far the best , funniest actor I've ever known of to this day and when I first known of his from Kung fu Hustle. He is brilliant in every way, not to mention CUTE : )  LOL... and this movie is just hysterical, even if you're not a sports person, and you know of Stephen Chows funny humor, you will still just love this movie, I almost didn't buy because I personally am not a sports person, hence do not enjoy watching films with that in there... BUT this is like my only exception, because of whose in it, and it's more of Kung Fu combined with soccer... In its hilarious way though... Love this film~! and any Stephen Chow films have so far been the most funnest i've seen!!!! Highly recommend this and any other of his films, you will not be disappointed  : ) Wish more comedies had his style!!!!",1498348800,,839,4.270440251572327

1675230,4,B00005Y7GQ,"While this shares some of the wonderful sense of the surreal and absurd that made Chow's 2008 ""Kung Fu Hustle"" a true classic comedy spoof of marshal arts films, it's nowhere near as consistent or as inventive in it's comedy. There are some real laughs, but also some serious dead spots and too-easy jokes in this tale of a bunch of once Shaolin trained Kung Fu masters giving up their hum-drum and largely unsuccessful work-a-day lives to team up and become the mightiest soccer playing force the world has ever seen.

Or are they? Team Evil is waiting to take them on in the $1 million soccer tournament.

Good-hearted and original enough to be worth seeing once, but unlike it's even wilder and smarter descendant I can't imagine feeling a need to go back and see it again, or to own it. If that later film is like a Hong Kong action Monty Python film, this one is more Three Stooges.",1495238400,,887,4.503105590062112

This version in Amazon is heavily edited and cut and it definitely removed a lot from the movie. All writings you see in English are supposed to be in Cantonese and even though some of  the lyrics are still in Cantonese, all of the original music and lyrics are supposed to  be in Cantonese and of course much better than the replaced westernized versions. There are many funny moments are cut and I think it somewhat affected the story as well. And I can't really tell since I cannot speak Cantonese but the subtitles must be translated differently in some scenes because the original version that I watched from the DVD had different English subtitles which make much more sense than this one.

1675414,5,B00005Y7GQ,"I'd heard of this film from a couple of places, but an Asian friend finally convinced me to watch it. I should've watched it long before now.

Shaolin Soccer is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's almost like a ""so good it's bad"" film, except instead it's ""so weird it's funny"", yet well-orchestrated and heartwarming at the same time. Not very often does a film manage to hit all these points at the same time, and do it well. Shaolin Soccer executes all this perfectly. The special effects are also well-executed, and even though they're ridiculously over-the-top, they manage to fit in very well with the rest of the film's action and visual themes. Nothing ""wow!""-inspiring, but that's hardly necessary in a film like this. It's no Hollywood blockbuster, but it doesn't need to be.

The plot is well done also. It's nothing special, but the beats and intentional corniness match perfectly. The story doesn't draw attention to itself by being too big or too small, but manages to fit in with the film as a whole and make things feel cohesive. A real shame that Michael Bay couldn't do the same for Transformers.",1446854400,,1115,4.742268041237113

Shaolin Soccer's Stephen Chow has been able to marry kung-fu and comedy that doesn't make you wince like Jackie Chan.  Shaolin Soccer is has a great story line.  It is witty and fast moving.

Their superpowers coincide with the soccer position they play. This is useful as they fend off Team Evil and their wicked mentor.

1675570,3,B00005Y7GQ,"""Shaolin Soccer"" is just one of those films you should never go into expecting some great, ground breaking cinema.  Just look at the title, can we really expect much?  But, with all that, it is still a very entertaining and unique film with a wonderful premise and awesome action...and even some amazing lessons to be learned along the way.  This is, in many ways, ""The Little Giants"" if they were older and Asian.

FOR CONCERNED PARENTS AND FOLKS:
You really don't have much to worry about.  No sex, no nudity, only comic violence (this is soccer...and a martial arts flick), no real innuendos (the only instance that can be taken that way isn't really if taken in context...it's the egg scene if you want to look that up).  All in all, it's safe and sound.

PLOT (NO SPOILERS):
The basic premise is ""what would happen if a poor, rundown (but aspiring) Kung Fu practitioner ran into a soccer coach?""  There's not much else to it as far as the complete story arc is concerned.  But it is executed convincingly (for what it is) and very well.  Tinge of romance, issues of letting fame and wealth go to your head, themes of controlled strength abound in the film.  Expect to see a lot of old school martial arts idioms...some of which are intentionally exaggerated for affect.  The pacing is quite slow and gradual though...this is definitely still an Asian film and not a comedic Jim Carey film.  Still, the film was very creatively done with many funny moments that had me rolling.

CHINESE ORIGINAL FILM CUT VS US THEATRICAL:
Ok, it should be noted that the DVD carries both the original Chinese cut of the film as well as the US theatrical cut.  Only the US cut has English dubs to go with it.  Well, I'm on the fence with this.  It's cool to hear the Chinese...but it's also hilarious to have the English dubs.  With the English Dubs, it plays just like the classic ""bad dubs"" of early martial arts films...and it seems quite intentional.  Still, in the end, though I've seen both, I would greatly recommend watching the Chinese original cut, since it fills in gaps in the story much more.

ALL IN ALL:
This is a fun and amazingly humorous light film.  It does have some touching moments and great and deeper lessons...but is very much slapstick through an through.  It is important to note, again, that some may be turned off by its slower pace.  Still, it should be seen at least once.",1344297600,3,2390,4.55868544600939
1675571,4,B00005Y7GQ,"""Shaolin Soccer"" updates the traditional high fantasy martial arts movie that dominated the 80s by infusing it with modern sensibilities. It's gleefully dumb and knows it, filling the on-screen acrobatic antics with a winking nod to its predecessors.

Arch villainous soccer league manager Hung (Patrick Tse Yin) convinced the soccer star Fung (Ng Man Tat) known as ""Golden Leg"" to throw a championship game. Hung now leads Team Evil - you read that right, Team Evil - and after years of service he fires Fung from his entourage. Disgraced and now lame, Fung plans to field a rival team. That rival team begins with ""Steel Leg"" Sing (Stephen Chow), a Shaolin Kung Fu master determined to bring the ancient system of martial arts to everyday life. Steel Leg sets out to reunite with his martial arts brethren and bring glory to Shaolin.

The brothers include Iron Shirt Tin (Kai Man Tin), Light Weight (Chi Chung Lam), Lightning Hands (Kwok-Kwan Chan), Hooking Leg (Mei Lin Mo), and Iron Head (Won Yut Fei). All of them have a talent that is both humorous and breathtaking. Iron Shirt can hold any soccer ball in his gut. Light Weight can launch himself into the air despite his girth.  Lightning Hands' speed makes him an excellent goalie.  Hooking Leg can propel soccer balls at high speeds with an acrobatic twist of his torso. Iron Head makes a great header.  And of course Steel Leg is capable of smashing soccer balls with such force that he threatens airplanes.  It's what the Justice League might look like playing soccer.

With such superpowers at their disposal the team proves unstoppable.  Buoyed by their success, it's not long before they (and the movie) acquire endorsements from Puma and face down Hung's Team Evil on the field. Team Evil is just as powerful as our Shaolin superheroes, only, you know, evil.  They have an evil counterpart for each of them, and worse, multiple copies: the jumping guy, the hard-headed guy, the powerful kicker, etc.

Meanwhile Iron Leg's friendship with Mui (Vicki Zhao), a pimply-faced insecure girl who uses tai chi to make mantou, becomes strained when her overtures at romance are rejected. Dejected, she disappears, only to reappear at the eleventh hour when Team Evil brings out the big guns.

Despite its goofy sensibilities, it's hard not to love this film.  ""Shaolin Soccer"" humorously embraces the usual chopsocky tropes and then exaggerates them even further with a dose of CGI. Although the movie is nominally about soccer, it's really about brotherhood, friendship, and beating the jerk who betrayed you.  Martial arts fans will get a real kick out of it.",1339286400,,2617,4.920454545454546
1675572,5,B00005Y7GQ,"This is truly a comedy worth watching.  If all soccer teams played like this it would be the number 1 sport in the world.

Funny stuff.",1333843200,,316,4.216666666666667
1675573,5,B00005Y7GQ,"I must say this is a unique film. It's filled with a whimsical sense of humor with moments of genuine pathos, emotion and excitement. Basically this combines some of the best of sports movies and martial arts movies and spoofs them both.

Ostensibly set in 1980's China, a half dozen former shaolin monks are brought together by a sincere and idealistic young leader and taught by their coach, a former star player also down on his luck after he threw the game for a corrupt boss and got his leg broken by a mob. Stephen Chow's lead character knows little more in life than kung fu, but tries to make the lives of people around him better including that of a young woman who bakes sweet buns he chances to meet one day.

The film is short, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is full of great lines and lots of fun wire work and special effects. I can't say much more about this film except that it has to be seen to be believed. There are also lots of references to other blockbuster films like the Matrix, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan sprinkled throughout.

The action is slapstick and there's a quick moment where one of the players gets his clothes blown off in comic fashion (only seen from the back for a second), so it's for more mature audiences with a good sense of humor.

There are few modern movies like Shaolin Soccer. Even the follow-up ""Kung Fu Hustle"" just didn't charm me like this one did. So without spoiling it further, I encourage you to go watch it and see what you think!",1329004800,,1506,4.425992779783393

1675609,5,B00005Y7GQ,"I'm late to the party but let me jump on that bandwagon anyway. SHAOLIN SOCCER is when Stephen Chow first made big noise, to which he quickly capitalized with the brilliant KUNG FU HUSTLE. And I guess I'll go off on a brief tangent and just call him out for not having done much lately. Dude was already a name in Hong Kong, but SHAOLIN SOCCER is what put him on the world stage.

Stephen Chow borrows from Jackie Chan's schtick and improves on it, infusing SHAOLIN SOCCER with broad humor, dazzling martial arts, and even a wacky musical number. It's huge fun, and unlike Jackie's habit of exhibiting clownish expressions, Stephen consistently maintains a deadpan demeanor which I think makes his comedy more effective. Stephen Chow plays ""Mighty Steel Leg"" Sing, a scruffy cleaner and post-graduate student whose ambition is to make Shaolin kung fu accessible to the masses. And he regards the game of soccer as the means to achieving this. Under the tutelage of disgraced ex-soccer star Fung a.k.a. ""Golden Leg,"" Mighty Steel Leg and his reunited motley band of fellow Shaolin Temple alums parlay their kung fu training onto the soccer field. And while the film takes its sweet time to get these reluctant players on the field, once they do, it generates this exhilarating momentum. You can take or leave Chow's patented cinematic ticks but there's no denying the masterful visual effects that come into play. We get treated to some wildly spectacular sight gags.

The story takes time to introduce its characters and their sordidness, and this lends a rooting interest for the viewer. Ultimately, it's Fung who provides the film's emotional anchor, with Stephen Chow wrangling the most showy role. But the most endearing character, for my  money, is the unsvelte Iron Head, played by Wong Yat Fei, an actor who has a way with physical comedy. Vicki Zhao plays the sympathetic role of Mui, the painfully shy girl whose bakery-fu is most excellent and whose tai chi goalie skills are, as we learn, very formidable. But Mui's delectable steam buns are what inspire a musical number.

As Mighty Steel Leg goes about recruiting his Shaolin brothers, it's readily apparent that these slovenly blokes have neglected their kung fu. So cue the amusing training montages, all this to prep the team to cut a swath thru national soccer competition and on to a championship showdown with the dreaded Team Evil, a crew what had won the Super Cup five years running and is fueled by (if you're watching the original Chinese version) ""evil American drugs.""

If you haven't seen SHAOLIN SOCCER or KUNG FU HUSTLE, you're in for something you've never seen before, something bordering on the surreal. Stephen Chow specializes in offbeat martial arts flights of fancy. I love the little touches he injects, from the goalie (not Mui) clad in the classic yellow Bruce Lee track suit to that little bit that Mui does as the musical number abruptly ends to Mui's hilarious fail which has her reporting to the other team's goal post, to the shame of her teammates. This DVD allows for the option to see the film either in its American version or in the original Chinese version. Except you should see it in the original Chinese version which has a running time of 112 minutes as opposed to the severely edited 87 minutes long American version. The American version is also minus the closing outtakes.",1320105600,,3379,4.839100346020762

1675614,4,B00005Y7GQ,"As the cliche goes, this is a film of two halves.

The first half is funny, witty, ground breaking stuff - a Kung Fu film that you laugh with and not at. I was amazed at the sharpness of the occasionally surreal comedy and of the fast paced and clever script, that surprised and amazed in equal measure.

However, the scene where our hero chats up the female lead is the 'Jump the Shark' moment, where the film turns from ground breaking to cliched and predictable. All the special effects in the world can't make the final match work, and the whole enemy-team-on-drugs ploy doesn't explain why they are so much better than the Shaolin monks.

1675649,5,B00005Y7GQ,"Shaolin dumplings? Kung fu parking? Hedge-trimming as a martial art? You'll observe all three in Stephen Chow's version of an American sports movie blended with computerized 'action' a la Squinting Dragon Belching Tiger. The story line of ""Shaolin Soccer"" is almost exactly parallel to the baseball comedy Major League: a bunch of geeky losers take on the Team Evil champions for the national title. The geeks need a tough talking-to from their revitalized has-been coach, but they ""man up"" in time to win. Manning-up requires the last-minute appearance of the dumpling-maker kung fu master, the awkward ugly girl who will win the heart of the 'striker' Iron Leg. The bigshot boss of Team Evil, who has doused his players with ""American drugs"", gets his just desserts.

Be sure you watch the ""original Chinese version"" with English subtitles rather than the dubbed American version.... though that also might be amusing, if the dubbing is as goofy as the subtitling. This is definitely ""soccer"" as I'd like to see it played, rather than the drab back-and-forth of the WORLD Cup version that often results in scores of 0-0.",1285113600,,1122,5.032258064516129

Got those two checked? Then enjoy the movie with a loved one or a kidnapping victim (for you serial killers out there).",1244160000,,616,4.495495495495495

It's that outrageous, far-out: a slapstick film containing martial arts, supernatural power and the sport of soccer.

We get the usual misfits-make good story, which is nothing new, but how it happens in unlike anything I've ever seen. I can't recall how many times I literally laughed out loud watching these ludicrous scenes. The climactic soccer game at the end got carried away, of course, but it was still fun to watch.

Earlier in the story, the bizarre dialog, odd encounters with different characters and the humor is stupid many times.....but so stupid, it's comical! I just shook my head in amazement at what I was seeing and hearing. Be prepared, as I said, for some incredible dumb things, but also for much weird but definitely entertaining stuff.

Note: I watched the short ""English theatrical version"" which runs 89 minutes. You can also view the 112-minute Chinese version. From what I've heard, read, and witnessed, the 89-minute is sufficient. Any more of this insanity would be too much.",1240531200,,1175,4.806930693069307

The effects are just so over the top and ridiculous that you just cant help but laugh, and they're done that way on purpose. My favorite scenes are when  Mighty Steel Leg and Iron Head sing in the club, I was laughing so hard I had to step out to catch my breath, and the first game they play, against the local gang of ruffians and Steel Leg is on his back and it turns into a war movie scene, that was classic. I definetly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a laugh and enjoy some great martial art effects. Plus how can you not love a movie in which the bad guys are literally called Team Evil.

1675710,5,B00005Y7GQ,"This is a hilarious and heart-warming tale of a group of downtrodden kung fu brothers who find new life in the world of football (soccer). It features the dynamic and hugely entertaining Stephen Chow, a man who makes his comrades in Western success Jackie Chan and Jet Li pale in comparison. Where Li is wooden and dull and Chan tries far too hard, Chow has an indifference that is refreshing. In some ways similar to his later offering, ""Kung Fu (Hustle),"" although less dark and violent, this movie is suitable for the whole family, particularly when you factor in the poignant lesson of avoiding prejudice.
The action is over-the-top CGI magic and makes for many of the belly laughs, but the romantic subplot between Chow's dreamer and the ugly duckling bun maker is a sweet and unique concept. The mere fact that Chow creates a character that sees beauty beneath the scarred exterior of the skilled yet self-doubting street vendor is a testament to all that Hollywood fails to understand about their audience.

It's funny, touching and inspired, with some instances of cheesy special effects and strange humor laced throughout. If you liked Kung Fu Hustle at all, you have to watch this film. It's that simple.

I finally purchased the DVD today and I have to say that I'm slightly disappointed and only because this DVD is lacking in the features department.

But that's really it. No special features to speak of.

The picture quality is fine but I have to make special mention of the sound. This has one of the most active 5.1 mixes and if you want a film that really puts your surround system to the test, look no further.

In a nutshell, if you want a technically great presentation of the film and not much else, go with this. If you are looking for an edition loaded with behind the scenes info and commentary, etc, etc, prepare to be sorely disappointed.",1154995200,4,1275,4.3940677966101696

1675745,5,B00005Y7GQ,"One in a long list of films that have been butchered by Miramax in an effort to make Hong Kong films more palatable, SHAOLIN SOCCER suffered doubly due to shifting release dates (it was pushed back for over a year and a half).  In its native country, SHAOLIN SOCCER was one of the most successful films and for good reason.  It takes the typical ""ragtag underdogs teaming up to fight against insurmountable odds"" adding Shaolin kung fu and special effects to the mix for a perfect combination.

  When the formerly formidable soccer star Golden Leg Fung (Man Tat Ng)--now a limping lackey thanks to his teammate Hung (Patrick Tse)--loses his job, he hopes to start his own soccer team.  He happens upon Sing (Stephen Chow), a cleaner who has been charged by his former master with spreading the techniques of Shaolin kung fu.  Sing has been searching for a way to repackage Shaolin in a new, exciting, and socially viable form.  It takes a bit but Sing finally realizes that his ""Iron Leg"" technique would be a perfect fit in Golden Leg's dream soccer team.

  Golden Leg and Iron Leg set out to convince Sing's five other brothers to join in their venture.  They discover that Iron Head (Yut Fei Wong), Empty Hand (Kwok Kuen Chan), Weight Vest (Lam Chi Chung), Hooking Leg (Chi-Sing Lam), and Iron Shirt (Kai Man Tin) have let their confidence and skills lapse.  Can they regain the spirit from their idealistic days of youth?  You better believe it!  After some hilarious training sequences, the brothers come together as a team and begin to make their way through the ranks of the soccer championships until their showdown with Hung's appropriately named ""Evil Team.""

  Along the way, Sing meets Mui (Vicki Zhao), a master of Tai Chi and bread making.  When the two meet, Sing's infectious optimism and singing create chaos in the streets and results in a dance sequence highly inspired by Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video.  This moment is typical of the uproarious tone of Chow's film.  As much as it took from other ""losers banding together"" films like THE BAD NEWS BEARS, REVENGE OF THE NERDS, and THE REPLACEMENTS, Chow's film helped pave the way for other Asian ""extreme sport"" films such as Fumihiko Sori's PING PONG and Yudai Yamaguchi's BATTLEFIELD BASEBALL.

  A word of warning: in all, nearly twenty-two minutes of the film were eliminated for the long-delayed, limited US release.  Things missing include the backstory between Fung and Hung.  Avoid this version at all costs.  Region free NTSC versions with English subtitles are readily available via innumerable web vendors.

There are two versions of the film on this DVD. Although it's tempting to watch the ""Americanized"" version, you'll be doing yourself a grave injustice if you do. The original Chinese version, subtitled, is a far better experience. Yes, my kids prefer the Americanized vesion, since it's dubbed, but the Chinese version is a much more complete and enjoyable film.

It's full of silly comedy, but it also has a very nice story about a team of losers seeking to become something more.  Yes, that's nearly every sports movie that's ever been made, but what seperates Shaolin Soccer is its visual flair.

The movie takes those old Wu Shu cliches and puts them on the soccer field.  More importantly, it does so without insulting the kung fu genre.  This is a silly movie, but it's also full of geniune characters and enjoyable action.  Never has soccer been more ridiculous or awe-inspiring.

I hate to compare movies, but I'd have to say that though this film and Kung Fu Hustle share a lot in common, they are also very different.  Shaolin Soccer is more realistic, set mostly in the real world, with super martial arts as its only strong fantasty element.  It's a quieter film, but by no means did I find it boring.

I'm not a big fan of the ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" special effects by any means. Yet in this movie with similar effects I couldn't get enough of it. Mainly due to Stehpen Chow and the excellent writing, casting and directing (Stephen Chow pretty much does it all.) This is a movie that leaves an impression on you due to the fantastic cast and hilarious story. Wich by the way is about a soccer team of misfits put together for revenge and profit. Revenge on the part of the coach of the Shaolin team who is out to get back at his nemesis for past wrong doings. Profit for the ex-Shaolin kung-fu masters down on thier luck.

I won't say much more about this movie since I couldn't come close to doing it justice. If you like creative and original movies this is a priceless treasure. Mind blowing creativity and all round production.

I would be hard pressed to even think, of anyone, in cinema more talented and refined at making movies than Mr Chow. By making I don't mean just acting in or directing movies just to make a quick Hollywood buck. I mean having creative power all the way from the initial idea to making and putting it on screen.

Stephen Chow does a lot in this movie and others. He will stand out though for having tons of screen presence and massive charm. This whole cast is as top-notch as it gets. If you like comedy or kung-fu or creativity or epic and imaginary special effect scenes, or all of those things watch this movie!

This is like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Meets the Mighty Ducks.  A former soccer great called Golden Leg Funghad his career ruined after a gangster caused him to break his legendary leg.  years later, Fung meets a Kung Fu Master named Sing whose steel leg can do wonders on a soccer ball.  Sing is a Bruce Lee look-alike and even wears the yellow jump suit that Lee wore in Game of Death.  Fung reunites Sing with his former Shaolin brothers and puts their remarkable Kung Fu skills to work on the soccer field.  The brothers all have names which are clues to their Kung Fu Skills such as Iron Head, Lighting Hands, Iron Shirt Tin, and hooking leg.

Together they form one outrageous teams complimented by Matrix like special effects as  balls are kicked and scream like rockets, trailing fire and tearing up the field as they fly towards the opponents goal.  Or Hooking Leg demonstrates the most incredible degree of hook ever seen as his kicks turn 90 degrees.  Fung sets them up for a run in a bis soccer tournament and a show down with the team of the mob leader who caused his injury years earlier.  His team is called the dastardly ""Team Evil"" just in case their black uniforms and scowls didn't tip you off.

The formula works like any of those American films such as Mighty Ducks, Bad News Bears or the like.  Shaolin Soccer is like watching a live action cartoon with the wild, slap-stick action and special effects.  The cast is hilarious with brilliant one-liners and facial expressions.

1675759,4,B00005Y7GQ,"Shaolin Soccer makes for perfectly ridiculous fun when a team of down and out kung fu masters coalesce around a degraded legend turned coach to take the sport of Chinese soccer to new heights (literally).  For twenty years, Golden Leg Fung (Man Tat Ng) has limped around in the service of Team Evil Coach Hung (Yin Tse) waiting for his chance to be a coach, only to be ridiculed and driven away.  Then he meets a poor kung fu master out on the streets and, after seeing what incredible leg power the fellow has, comes up with the crazy idea of forming a soccer team of kung fu masters.  Mighty Steel Leg Sing (Stephen Chow), who had been looking for a way to spread kung fu teachings among more of the populace, quickly seeks out his former Shaolin brothers, none of whom are interested - at first.  Eventually, the new dream team is assembled.  There's Iron Shirt Tin, Iron Head, a very hefty Light Weight, Lightning Hands, and Hooking Leg (each of them named after his particular kung fu specialty).  They don't know the first thing about soccer, and Golden Leg has a time trying to coach them up in time to enter the big, upcoming soccer tournament.  Just when everything appears lost, the guys' kung fu powers are reawakened, and it's Game On from that point on.  They aren't exactly intimidating when they come out in their yellow bathrobes, each one of them less athletic-looking than the next, but it's immediately obvious that these guys, with their high-flying, ball-screeching skills, are a force to be reckoned with.  They are most definitely a sight to see.

There's one more kung fu master in town, a shy young woman named Mui (Zhao Wei) who has no self-confidence and works making sticky buns (using kung fu, of course).  Might Steel Leg Sing befriends her, and there's a weird kind of romance between the two, but their weird relationship is sort of a weak spot in the story - although Mui herself is certainly a character of great importance.  The film is really just about absurdly unreal kung fu soccer moves on (and above) the field and their culmination in the championship game between Team Evil and our beloved Shaolin Soccer Team.  Hung, never above cheating, manages to put a team on the field that can actually outmatch the seemingly invincible kung fu soccer team, making it a contest unlike any you've ever seen before.  CGI effects aplenty accompany each and every move on the field, serious injuries abound, and the enthusiastic crowd loves every minute of it.  You'll see soccer play that even Pele could not have dreamed of (largely because it's all physically impossible) in this ultimate battle of good and evil.  There's never really much doubt about how things will end, but that doesn't take away from any of the zany super-soccer special effects that make this the most exciting soccer game in history.

Shaolin Soccer is funny by design, and the key to making such a film is to go all out with the special effects.  That's exactly what Stephen Chow does in this hilarious blend of soccer, kung fu, and comedy.  Even when it takes on a distinctly cartoonish air, Shaolin Soccer proves more entertaining by the moment.  With its constant humor and spectacular special effects, the film all but guarantees that a good time will be had by all.",1135123200,,3277,4.695804195804196

STORY: A man named Sing (Chow) is a kung-fu master. He meets a soccer coach, who is not satisfied by his Kung-fu techniques. Then, Sing meets a girl, and gets his relatives together to play a game of kung-fu soccer!

He borrows from American films as well as Eastern cinema but adds enough of his own unique touches to distinguish himself from other filmmakers.  The film carries on the tradition of great sports films like ""Rocky"" and ""The Bad News Bears"" but adds martial arts into the mix.  There's also a touching love story here that doesn't bog down the proceedings.  Chow is a greatly imaginative visualist and the film contains any number of hilarious sight gags.  Chow also provides great verbal dialogue if the subtitles can be trusted.

1675785,3,B00005Y7GQ,"I was out with some buddies this past Tuesday and, for some reason, the talk turned to what was the worst and the best comic book movie. I maintain that the best is Unbreakable, but the others wanted to limit the selection to movies that were adaptations of comics rather than simply movies that captured the underlying myths and tropes of the genre (which, typically, means superheroes, at least in the U.S.). The best adaptation that I know of is probably Spiderman, although X-Men is very close. I personally despise Burton's Batman. Although I understand my friend Matt Cutter's argument that it is Burton's Batman, I can't get over the problem that he allows actors to step outside of the roles they are supposed to be playing, making it as much of a wink-and-a-nod to the meta set rather than a faithful adaptation. I haven't seen Nolan's Batman Begins (it's in my netflix queue though), although I've heard good things about it, nor have I seen Sin City. Hellboy did a great job of capturing the look and feel of the comic that it was drawn from, but I just didn't think it was all that good of a movie.

Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer

Which brings us to Shaolin Soccer, which would have my vote for the best movie adapted from a manga, if only it had been. Instead, trivia has it that creator and star Stephen Chow had been inspired by an animated television series on soccer called ""Captain Tsubasa,"" which may, for all I know, have been based on a manga series. Whatever, the visual effects and broad humor of the movie perfectly capture the style of manga, from the exaggerated facial expressions that Chow and his co-stars make, to the way that the soccer ball tears up the ground and grass and can blowback people in its power. The best scene, by far, is the climatic goal defense, where Mui adapts a kung fu stance and a wavering yin/yang symbol appears in the air before her while the attacking player has an evil demon in the air above him that he draws into the ball itself, which then flies through the air so fast that it becomes a fireball.

I found the movie much funnier than J did, and I'm not sure exactly why. Perhaps it's because I'm more familiar with manga and the style of humor that the movie used, which is more disjointed than a Western comedy, with flights of imagination that rival Amelie in their elaborateness (such as the break into a dance sequence straight out of a music video early on). The violence was much more graphic here, as well, although its (I have to say it) ""comic book violence"" where no one is hurt for very long, unless it is necessary for the plot.",1129334400,,2604,4.512711864406779

Everyone already talked about the plot but I'll mention it anyway. The movie's about an old man who used to be a soccer star until his leg was broken, who forms a soccer team with a bunch of kung fu masters.

This movie has nonstop hilarious moments which I'll let you discover on your own. Even minor things like the fact that the kung fu team is beating another team 40-0 is hilarious.

1675815,3,B00005Y7GQ,"Director Stephen Chow plays a down on his luck Shaolin monk turned street bum named Sing in the chinese soccer version of Ladybugs, Major league, Bad News Bears and other movies where mitfits can become winners against an evil opponent.

The story actually starts off with a tournament 20 years earlier with a confrontation between teammates ""Golden Leg"" Fung and Hung. Fung is the arrogant hero that misses the free kick at a crucial game and is attacked by the crowd. 20 years later Hung is now the boss of a National Soccer tournament and Fung is his lackey that is soon fired.

Fung and Sing meet and at first Fung doesn't see the purpose of integrating Shaolin Kung Fu into a soccer tournament, but after seeing him in action against a group of thugs, he quickly changes his mind. Sing gathers his usual suspects, a group of ex-shaolin monks that have moved on with their life. There is a Bruce Lee lookalike that is umemployed, a stock broker who can suck a ball into his lap, a huge 200 lb grocery stock boy who can jump 50 feet at a time, a janitor who can breakdance with a soccer ball and a nightclub lackey who has an iron head, which comes in handy since the owner always seems to be smashing a bottle over his head for his incompetence.

The group enter the National Soccer tournament and at first practice, they suck. However, as they improve, they become the team to beat and Hung is getting worried that his Steroid/Chemical enhanced team won't be up to par to win the $1M prize. More importantly, will Sing's goal to make Shaolin Kung Fu more famous succeed?

As you can see, the plot of this movie is secondary to each individual scene. As vignettes, this movie does very well. Stephen Chow is charismatic as Sing and his love interest Mui is also appropriately meek. However, the relationship is flawed from the beginning. There is chemistry spart between them, and Chow has to work on it real hard in order to make it work.

There are other comedic points that seem strange to Western Audiences. The cross dressing hair-dresser scene seems completely out of place, as is the fact that Mui accepts mid-80's shoulder pad fashion as ""in"". To someone who's been to Hong Kong, that just doesn't make sense. It also doesn't make sense for two soccer players (Karen Mok and Cecillia Cheung) to be wearing moustaches and beards, but maybe that's a cultural thing.

The SFX is also hit and miss. Of course, this is a lower budget movies, so some scenes, especially to do with bodies flying through the air, don't work and look really fake. However, some other scenes, especially during the soccer games are not so bad and actually exciting to watch. The final game is also the pinnacle of the movie, because they actually meet their match against guys straight out of the ""Universal Soldier"" movies.

It is a good movie that appeals to Eastern tastes more than anything and while Miramax seems to have bought the international rights to this movie, I don't see it having wide appeal to non-Asian audiences (especially to those people who couldn't accept the movie ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").

1675816,4,B00005Y7GQ,"I thought this was gonnah be serious monks playing soccer or something, but it turned out it is a movie using the idea. A soccer star in the 80's has become a bum and he finds out his X teammate who is coaching the #1 team now was behind it all... he eventualy gets people trained in Kung-Fu to be his team to take to a tournament, with some persasian and practice they use there martial arts training and incorporate it into the game of soccer to compete for a million dollar prize, a long the way is side storys of love, respect, honor and goofy comedy.

The acting is way over the top, but it's not unbareabull, it's supposed to be over the top and fun.. the CGI effects are over the top aswell, but it adds to the comedy.

Overall it's quite a suprising family film, you don't have to be into martial arts to enjoy this film, and you don't have to like soccer either... it's just all in good fun and worthy of a rental for a familly night in.... it kind of is an over the top Soccer version of the Harlem Globetrotters.",1119571200,,1023,4.161616161616162

But here it's agenst the rules to be a class A chump.  Well on third thought they don't care, they'll let you find out the hard way by letting the other team give you a humiliating beatdown.

The story starts with Golden Leg(Man Tat Ng) Who was famus until he made a big mistake.  While depressed he ran into Sing(Stephen Chow) who told him how useful Shaolin is in multiple ways.  This guy loves sholin so much, he falls for a not-so attractive employee for a steam bun store(Vicki Zhao Wei, who in reality isn't ugly(dang makeup) but very very cute).  And when it is interjected that Shaolin can be used for soccer, that's when the parterner ship between Golden Leg, and Sing expandes to more friends, to go to the prestigious tournament, shoot for $1,000,000, and to revive the Golden Legs name, and get the right word of Shaolin around.  But in order to acomplish this, they must man up to hand out whoopings, or get stomped.

This movie has very creative ways of making comedy.  Some things start a laugh by making you say what the fudge?(Like when everyone was dancing at the steam-bun stand, and when Sing was visualizing a Saving Private Ryan theeme while in the test game)  They have so much comedy in this film, from horrible Chareokee singers, to a bald girl getting called E.T.(Well what was she thinking)  The special effects are fake looking but the way it's used is just for-jorkin' hillarious.(Like when guys fly around after getting hit)

Shaolin Soccer is an exellent film by Stephen Chow, the directer, wrtiter and the star.(Alot, but not to much for one man)  This film is well done, and thank God there was the oringinal Chinese unrated version on the DVD.

Admittedly, for those who are looking for the sort of stunts that Chan has become famous for they might be somewhat disappointed. CGI is very apparent throughout the movie, although not overwhelmingly so. Chow's skewering of pop culture in his quest to find a way to make money out of being a Shaolin Monk in the modern world, however, by far overshadows the special effects and places this comedy firmly in a catagory of its own. And for those who can overlook the fact that CGI is used for some of the stunts and enjoy the impossible feats of Chow and his ""brothers"" (such as the Matrix-esque human-pinball fight scene behind the brick wall and the climactic final match), an enjoyable evening of laughs should ensue.

1675830,5,B00005Y7GQ,"What a wonderful sports film. STOP, read that line one more time. I ask you to do this because you will probably never see this again.

This was a sports film, for me to say that it wasn't would be a bold faced lie. This had all the characteristics of the modern Hollywood sports film, but what made it stand out and enjoyable is that it did not take itself seriously ... AND ... it had some amazing CGI action sequences. I recently watched a film called Equilibrium where it was mentioned that it could rival the popularity of The Matrix, well I would have to say that perhaps this film, Siu lam juk kau, would probably do more in toppling the king of bullet-time cinematography than Equilibrium would. I was impressed from the beginning till the end of this movie. The characters were all animated and individual in their own way. There was time used to set them up and learn about each of them. This wasn't one of those films where you spent most of your time with one of the characters then never really got to know the rest of them ... you knew them all and couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table next. Hong Kong has crafted a spectacular film here. They have taken the popularity of the bullet-time effect and applied it to a genre that definitely needed a face-lift. I am surprised that America wasn't the first to do this, but we are a nation that loves the standard sports film, so why change what we love. PWFSSSST. We are so lazy sometimes.

Siu lam juk kau tells a spectacular story coupled with some amazing graphics to create a story about love, teamwork, and superpowers. I also enjoyed the fact that this film also tried to say that kung-fu is not an old topic, that it can and should still be used in society today. When we think of the martial arts films (and physical aspect), we see them as a very old and dated genre. Well, let me be the first to say that they are coming back, and coming back with a vengeance. I enjoyed the fact that this was a revenge film. So many of our kung-fu films are revenge films, I was happy to see that this one was not far off. This film used techniques that I have not seen used in any other films. They took the old, skillful ways of the dated kung-fu film, added the work of bullet-time, and added the sports flare to it to create Siu lam juk kau.  It had us laughing, it kept us based in reality, and it focused my attention to the screen for the entire film (a task that no other sports film has been able to do). I think that by having your star also direct it (directed and starred Stephen Chow) it builds upon a sense of comfortability with the story. Chow is a master of slapstick, yet seldom overdoes the silliness, choosing carefully timed gags and meticulously mounted visual construction over slapdash comedy. The film is also no stranger to the bizarre, with Chow's multiple homages to Steven Spielberg, and a weird egg gag that I'm honestly shocked still remains the American cut of the picture.

Overall, Siu lam juk kau is a amazing combination of comedy, action, romance, and dazzling soccer footage, forming an irresistible package to those looking for something they haven't seen before. We see that it is a personal story that everyone is having fun being a part of. That also helped this film ... the characters really wanted to be in this film and it shined like the North Star through our screen. The dubbing (which seemed off a couple times) only added delight to this film. Chow's Siu lam juk kau, is and will always be breathtaking.

  Basic plot: Former soccer champ, poor and disdained, discovers a guy with real potential. From there they form a team and try to win a championship and achieve fame and glory.

  But describing the basic plot is like trying to describe the color ""blue"" to someone who can't see colors. It is the subtleties, humor and just plain weirdness of this one that make it a standout! Don't expect realism but a blend of fantasy and wish fulfillment...and, oh yes, soccer like it has NEVER been played before.",1107388800,,678,4.65546218487395

All of that aside, I cannot remember laughing out loud this hard in the grip of a movie in years!

Folks, this is parody at its best... taking anything even remotely serious about kung-fu movies and turning it into utter comic gold. The best way I can compare this movie would be to call it the ""Airplane"" or ""Top Secret"" of kung-fu movies. The actors are hilarious. This is more than a slapstick - it's the dialogue that really pushes it over the edge! The cgi animation is so over-the-top, it's impossible to care enough to be put off. Everything is perfectly preposterous, out of line and bizarre. And so, I have to say, it's as if they made this movie just for me.

Sure, the plot is well within the Bad News Bears/Replacements genre but what makes it unpredictable are the off-the-wall humor and overall tongue-in-cheek treatment of the director.

If you see this on DVD, buy it. Because one viewing isn't enough to capture all the hilarious scenes like the Face/Off like entry of the team members on the rooftop, the musical number where pedestrians join the action and acts as if nothing happened when it's over, and of course, the game antics of the two rivals.

Shaolin Soccer is fresh, funny and the special effects are great; it was better than Kung Pow and not nearly as cheesy.  Stephen Chow spoofs films from the Matrix to Kill Bill in his own inimitable Chinese way.  The story takes place in Asia, where main character Sing leaves his shaolin temple to seek his way in the world, specifically in the world of soccer.  His foot of steel and bad shoes leave indelible impressions on those he meets---and beats---along his journey to the world cup games.  He unwittingly captures the heart of a young woman and remains blissfully ignorant of her attraction to him, even when she repairs his tattered shoes with cute little Japanese animal stickers and patches.  The bad guys crop up predictably enough, but are nasty and it's great to see them gloat first and lose later.  The best scenes involve the other shaolin brothers when they emerge from their spiritual seclusion to join Sing in his quest for a championship.  Our family really enjoyed this movie and are glad we made the investment to own it.  It's a real pity that the film never made it big in the USA.  Obscure or not, Shaloin Soccer is a real treat of a genre comedy and will no doubt develop its own richly deserved cult following.",1097625600,11,1404,4.553784860557769

It had been a while since I had seen a movie that I found so original--certain scenes blew me away to say the least.  I took very little of the movie seriously as the title and the first scenes indicated that this movie is supposed to be viewed as a light-hearted farce.  This movie will take you for a ride if you let it.  Though some people, understandably, simply won't ""get"" it, the humor is fairly universal--largely physical comedy and slap-stick gags. ""Shaolin Soccer"" was the first Stephen Chow movie that I watched and it made me seek out more of his films.  If you like this movie, and if you do not mind subtitles, try to get your hands on a copy of Stephen Chow's equally irreverant ""God of Cookery"".",1097625600,5,848,4.369426751592357

1675853,5,B00005Y7GQ,"First off, the movie is about an ex-soccer player--who was permanently wounded when he was younger--that wants to coach his own soccer team.  He finds an enthusiastic guy who's alias is Steel Leg; this guy is one of five Shaolin Kung Fu students who really wants to incorporate what they learned with a popular thing in order to make it popular.  The main plot focuses on getting the team together then entering a championship that's worth $1 million to them if they win.

What was so great about Shaolin Soccer is that the story was captivating.  You just are pulled into it.  There's humor, drama, and even a drop of romance.  The special effects were amazing--not in a new way, but how uniquely they used it (Imagine using The Matrix type of FX in a comedy).  The comedy was varied:  satirical, physical, stupid, etc.  There's even a few short song numbers and one dance number (copied, respectively, from MJ's ""Thriller"").  There are wonderful camera angles and such, too.

Of course, it wasn't perfect.  Some of the editing was bad, and a few gags were repetitious.  The US version seemed to do well for those parts, but they also took out some very wonderful gags that only make the Chinese version better.  Since I mention the US version I'd like to say this:  the dubbing is like usual dubbed Chinese films (you won't like it as much).  Also, only watch it if you're in the mood to compare the two versions--I watched both versions back to back.  Another thing, and it's more to do with the dvd, is that the Chinese version's sections that are cut out of the US version aren't dubbed (i.e. scene of ""explosion"" to dance where the guy talks, but no words are up to hear it).

Overall, I loved this movie.

+ Wonderful special effects and action

+ Encapturing story

+ Awesome variety of humor

+ Beautiful cinematography

- A few unneeded repetitious gags

- Chinese version edited too little (US's edited too much)

? Where are the captions?

? What, no extras besides both editions?

Closing thoughts:  If you enjoyed the creativity of Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but thought either the story lacked or the action was uninteresting, you'll definitely find an interest in Shaolin Soccer.

If you have ever dreamed that you could do super human things when playing a sport, Shaolin Soccer will definitely deliver.  This movie almost has a One Flew over the Cookoo's Nest assortment of characters.

I guess we should be thankful that they've offered fans a subtitled version as well as a dubbed one. Sadly, none of the extras available on the Asian DVDs are included.

There are no extras to speak of. Not to mention there have been some changes to the songs on the soundtrack and a few cuts here and there.

Shaolin Soccer is an entertaining romp that deserves to be as hugely successful here as it was in its native country. While the print looks good, the lack of extras makes the Asian version the one worth tracking down for fans of this movie.",1093392000,7,691,4.433070866141732
1675870,4,B00005Y7GQ,"Shaolin Soccer is really a terrific piece of cinematic fun. It's at times hilarous, at times marvelous (while some special effects are obvious, some are seemless, and all of the martial-arts-style-soccer sequences in the film are breathtaking). It's a very comic-book style story of a group of Shaolin monks who have had to abandon the order to make a living. Steven Chow (the star, writer, and director of this Hong Kong Academy Award winning film) brings them together when he discovers that Shaolin can be used to play soccer! Together the reunited brothers take on team after team, under their former-soccer-star-turned-gimp coach played by Ng Man Tat, eventually challenging Team Evil, run by an evil beurocratic former soccer player who has a long history with the Shaolin team's coach. The road they travel, though, is filled with gag after gag and frequent displays of impressive Martial Arts action. There is an interesting quasi-romance story on the side featuring Chow and the beautiful Vicki Zhao (who is made up in the film to have growths all over her face) that was almost entirely cut out in the American theatrical run, but it's a very interesting story that provides a great character ark for Zhao.

When, as I mentioned before, Miramax presented Shaolin Soccer for theatrical release, it was in the form of a sliced-and-diced (re-edited hack job) that really undermined the intellegence behind the slapstick in Shaolin Soccer. Character development was reduced to nill and relationships lost meaning. Signs were translated into English through poor utiliazation of CGI. Still, it was great to see parts of the film on the big screen.

For DVD, though, Miramax provides both it's U.S. Theatrical version and the infinitely superior Original Chinese version (actually the extended version) on one reasonably priced DVD. The DVD, though containing 0 special features, is beautiful! I didn't bother watching the U.S. version (and neither will you, if you have any sense about you) but the 112 minute chinese version of the film is presented in a beatiful, almost faultless transfer. Sharpness is great, contrast is right on, grain is reduced, color balance is as good as one could hope for. It's a BIG improvement, visually, over the HK Universe DVD released a few years ago.

While the film might not fit everyone's taste, it's worth checking out for anyone. At least give it a rental and check out the original Chinese version, but I encourage you to take my advice and buy it now, as 90% of you will fall in love with the film once you see it. If you saw the film in theaters, regardless of whether you liked it then check out this disc! If you somehow liked the theatrical version, you'll fall head-over-heels in love with the original version. And if you didn't, I'm pretty sure the original version will surprise and fulfill you in ways the U.S. cut could not.

I don't give this film five stars because, while it's one of hte most entertaining films I've seen, the slapstick goes over the top a little too much for my tastes during a couple of instances. They're still funny, however, and the rest of it is so good that you can easily forgive those moments.

Go get it!",1093305600,,3191,4.858455882352941
1675871,5,B00005Y7GQ,"Shaolin Soccer is your typical Bad News Bears type story. It involves six masters of kung fu that have broken apart from each other and are working dead end jobs. The Walter Mathau type role of the broken down has been turned coach, goes to a washed up soccer star from twenty years ago that agreed to throw a championship game, and then had his leg permanently injued by an angry mob of fans. One of the masters, who has nicknamed himself Steel Leg, showcases what he can do, and convinces the coach to agree to form a team with him. Steel Leg then goes to his other five ""brothers"" as he calls them, and convinces them to quit their jobs and form a team. The masters go from knowing nothing about soccer, to becoming masters of it by using their knowledge of kung fu towards the game.

Shaolin Soccer is probably one of the best movies I have seen in the last couple of years. It involves a very nice mix of comedy, great special effects, and action sequences. I am not a big fan of soccer at all, but I must say that it came off quite well in this movie. It was very entertaining and interesting to see kung fu mixed together with it. Perhaps the film's best feature is the unbelieveable special effects that were used. Although some of the sequences used are over the top, the special effects are so good, that the sequences come off looking realistic.

Unfortunately Shaolin Soccer had a limited release in theaters. However, I highly recommend it. The DVD includes both the original Chinese version of the film with all the footage included, and the version that was released in U.S. theaters. Although I prefer watching the original version with subtitles, it is nice to be able to watch the theatrical version with the english language track when you don't feel like reading The extras for the DVD are somewhat limited.

1675895,5,B00005Y7GQ,"While I like to think of myself as an internationalist when it comes to watching films, I had never heard of Stephen Chow before deciding to take a chance on 'Shaolin Soccer.'
Shame on me. Chow turns out to be a hilarious and creative star. Who could have dreamed of something as goofy, infectious and, at the same time, as technically brilliant (the special effects are eye-popping) as Shaolin Soccer? Now, I'm reading through the comments left here by Mr. Chow's longtime fans and I realize I'm going to have to check out some of his ""better works"" (as judged by these aficionados) like 'God of Cookery' and 'From Beijing with Love'.
Not knowing what to expect from Shaolin Soccer, I found myself delightfully convulsed with laughter at two early points in the film:
- An impromptu synchronized 'street' rendition of the Kool and the Gang hit 'Celebration.' This is almost impossible to explain. When it took shape in the movie, I literally mouthed the words ""What the...?"" Truly inspired.
- A second muscial number, in which two of the Shaolin 'brothers' take to the stage in an ill-fated cabaret act. While I'm sure this was even funnier in Cantonese, even the wonderfully descriptive subtitles demonstrated the amateur campiness of their performance (which was exactly Chow's point).

- There's no way to skip to the menu while the disc is initially loading. This isn't a big deal the first time, but it does get kind of annoying to have to sit through the warnings and logo screens.
- The story kind of falls over itself towards the end. That might be kind of predictable given that this team would have destroyed everyone in the competition, but it kind of betrays the point of these guys playing together (to spread the word about Shaolin kung fu) when it looks like every team but the scrubs knows a little kung fu.

1675898,4,B00005Y7GQ,"I had heard about Shaolin Soccer (2001) a couple of years ago from a friend, as he had recommended it to me, knowing the particular way some of my tastes ran, and I am glad he did, as it's a heady mix of the wacky, the absurd, and the just plain fun.  The movie starts off with a flashback, showing an extremely popular Chinese soccer player named Golden Leg Fung accepting money to throw a game from a lackey, and the consequences of his actions, including a severely crippling beating by the crowd after purposely missing a rather easy goal scoring opportunity.  Now, it's many years later, and Fung now works for the gangster organization that had originally paid him off, in a completely demeaning position.  He dreams of coaching, but the once lackey who owns the current champion soccer team and is also chairman of the league, finds this notion completely humorous, and heap further degradations upon Fung.  Despondent, Fung ends up meeting a vagabond/shaolin follower called Steel Leg, and formulates a plan to build a new soccer team around this exceptional martial artist.  Fung also finds out Steel Leg has enough brothers, all once trained in martial arts, to make up a team.  Each brother has their own, unique ability, and soon they begin to practice.  During their first practice, the men suffer a fairly brutal beating (this whole pain, beating, and humiliation factor seems to be a constant theme throughout), but soon find their shaolin training coming back to them, and turn the tables on their opponents.  They enter the tournament, sweeping through the ranks, until finally the meet with the current champions, the Evil Team (I'm not kidding, that's their name), and meet the ultimate challenge, as the chairman gives his team a decidedly unfair advantage.  Will the shaolin players be victorious, or will they suffer the crushing defeat at the hands of the chairman and his evil team?

The special effects here are truly amazing and inventive, making for the most insane soccer playing I've ever seen.  Imagine someone being able to kick a soccer ball with the same force of shooting it out of a cannon, and with pinpoint accuracy.  There is not really a lot of actual soccer playing, in the traditional sense, as with the abilities of the players, the ball mainly zooms around in a very cartoonish manner.  Mixing kung fu and soccer is certainly and interesting concept, and provides some really spectacular visuals.  The English captioning is really bad, but certainly gave me much to laugh about, along with the seriously outlandish overacting.

Special features include an option to watch the film with the deleted scenes, the deleted scenes by themselves, a trailer, biographies, a featurette on the making of the film, a photo gallery, and behind the scenes featurette on how the special effects were made.  All in all, Shaolin Soccer is an unsane, over the top comedy steeped in outrageous action and definitely worth a look if you care to expand your horizons.

Foreign movies need to be kept in their original language and soundtrack. This changes EVERYTHING if you try to watch it in dubbed. Subtitles isn't even noticeable once you get used to it.

1675901,4,B00005Y7GQ,"I found this DVD title at my local New York Public Library branch and was intrigued by the title and also I vaguely remembered a trailer I saw in theaters last spring or summer.
First thing I noticed about the movie was how much better the print is compared to the typical Hong Kong flick.  Most HK films are grainy and greenishly dark, plus they are edited in weird ways.  (Admitted I haven't seen many HK movies but the ones I've seen always made me feel motionsick afterwards.)  The visuals on this film, on the other hand, are clean and well-balanced, with good color tones, albeit a bit high on the orange/yellow side.
The storyline is interesting but uneven at places.  The first hour of the 100-minute film is about how the players come together to form the team, and then the final match for the rest of the film.  There are a lot of funny moments, but also some jokes that could baffle a Western viewer.  Furthermore, there's a lot of oblique references to homosexuality, such as when the fat boy eats his precious chicken eggs off the stockbroker guy, and an unnecessarily excessive amount of male leg exposes.  A few scenes are superfluous and make the first half boring at times (e.g., the bar scene).
The movie is dominated by computer-generated special effects.  A ""making of"" featurette reveals much of the action was filmed with blue screens.  But I have to say the effects are quite good, and more refreshing than the stuff put out by Hollywood these days.  Most of the human-computer action sequences are well spliced together and therefore enjoyable.
Overall, Shaolin Soccer is an enjoyable film for every comedy fan, but especially for the martial arts and soccer crowds.  The HK version I saw feels uneven in many places, maybe that's why the U.S. theatrical release has been pushed back again and again.  Whether you rent it or borrow it from the library, it's a worthwhile movie to watch.",1075420800,18,1911,4.688622754491018

1675913,5,B00005Y7GQ,"Words fail me when trying to describe this movie to those who have not been fortunate enough to see it.  Imagine if the Matrix took place inside an 8-bit NES Super Dodge Ball cartridge, or if ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" were crossbred with ""Solarbabies.""  Stephen Chow, the director and star of this film, is a comedic genius on the level of David Cross during the Mr. Show days, or Ben Stiller at his top cinematic form (Mystery Men, for example).  In it, he plays an ever-optimistic kung-fu student who is desperately trying to reintroduce the ancient arts to a jaded world of cellphones and jetliners.  A chance meeting with a once-famous soccer star, now elderly and crippled, sets up the plot for one of the most well-executed and hilarious kung-fu movies of all time: the two conspire to combine kung-fu with soccer, creating a nigh-invincible team of superhumans.  This was obviously Chow's largest budget movie to date, as the special effects are on par with American films, but even without that extra boost the story would carry on just as well as it does in his other films (such as ""God of Cookery"").  I won't try to explain any further, as my pithy language skills could never do justice to the ever-increasingly preposterous scenes they would attempt to describe -- instead, I'll simply say: see it, and see it now!",1075248000,6,1334,4.778260869565218

They go on to recruit other kung fu masters and the coach then teaches them the fundamentals of soccer. The movie then progresses to show them developing into an indestructable soccer team. The scenes worth watching are the definitely the soccer scenes which involve ""Matrix"" like special effects. This is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen.

From the opening scene this movie grabs you and doesn't let go.  It is easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  It is creative and the effects aren't as cheesy as you might think.

Shaolin Soccer definitely falls into those categories. Movie is old by industry standards since it was made in 2001. It was recognized and wildly played in Asia and Europe but got none of the publicity in North America. Just like the title suggests Shaolin masters of Kung Fu are playing soccer. It's not another non stop Jackie Chan fighting movies. It has a decent plot; it has a fight between good and evil, greed and humbleness, lies and honesty. It teaches about friendship, being loyal, dedication and positive look on life regardless of the circumstances. And of course the special effects: amazing stunts and Matrix like action make it stand out from other Asian productions. Movie is well paced with no down time. Everything that happens, leads to more and more action. We have our share of baseball and football movies which all of them containing their dose of drama. Now it's time for a soccer movie. It's a bit of comedy mixed with action. Even if you've seen 1000 martial arts movies, even if you are sick and tired of sports genre flicks, see Shaolin Soccer.

1675942,5,B00005Y7GQ,"Stephen Chow has proven himself to be one of the world's finest directors with ""Shaolin Soccer"" (aka ""Kung-Fu Soccer""), which was Hong Kong's biggest-ever box-office success when released in 2001.  The simple story of a family of brothers who use Shaolin kung-fu to win the national China soccer tournament against The Evil Team (who use ""American medicines"" to win their games) is
bolstered by some hilarious comedy, spirited performances and
very creative special effects.  Outside of the comedic scenes--
which are among the funniest I've seen in a foreign film in a long time--the film's mystical element comes through most uniquely, as during the fabled hypnotic scene involving Mui's steamed bread making.  The part where the brothers are getting beaten to death on the field and then suddenly ""freeze"" revert to ancient kung-fu forms was also startling and wonderful.
Although banned in mainland China because it was released in Hong Kong before given official certification, this film also works as a glimpse into what the modern-day country looked like in 2001.  ""Shaolin Soccer"" was primarily filmed not in Hong Kong but in Shanghai, and uses that city's futuristic-looking new skyscrapers and hip, youthful citizens as a slick, glittery backdrop to its story. Never before has communist China looked this modern, confident and vibrant in a movie.  The special effects, too, are very cutting-edge, and work particularly well during the final soccer match where flying soccer balls become ferocious black tigers, and some kicks are so powerful as to rip the skin right off of the players.  At no point is this movie ever dull or uninteresting, and most of the time it moves at a roaring pace.  The director's cut on the foreign DVD is even better, as it features two lengthy scenes that were cut out of the original, but add to the subplot between Sing and Mui.
Whether you are a fan of martial arts, comedy, China, or just
plain good old fashioned filmmaking, this film is for you, and when it is released here in the US this August I hope it becomes
a phenomenon.  Very highly recommended--I have seen it three times now and it continues to grow on me.",1051228800,18,2163,4.923076923076923

All the performances from the actors are great espeically the bruce lee like mannorisms from the goalkeeper and Chows regular supporting cast member ""Ng Man Tat"" as golden leg.
The football matches may seem unrealistic but this is cinema, this is kung fu with Football ! Suspend belief and enjoy it for what it is, entertaining and funny, the final match between good vs evil will leave you feeling that you watched something special and something you'll want to watch again.

1675950,5,B00005Y7GQ,"In the summer of 2001, this hilarious comedy-action film was released in Hong Kong, and it immediately became the biggest hit there, even beating the previous box-office record of Jackie Chan's ""First Strike.""  The craze went on, and when it was released in Japan in May, 2002, it again became an instant smash hit even though Stephen Chow's name, before that release, had been known only among the small number of devoted Hong Kong film fans.  How the movie is received in US and other regions, I don't know, but as those facts testify, ""Kung-Fu Soccer"" is an incredibly funny movie.
[STORY}] You need one?  OK, it is about a young man Sing (Chow) who wants to promote the usefulness of kung-fu he learned at Shaolin Temple, and an ex-star soccer player ""Golden Leg"" Fung (good supporting actor Ng Man Tat), who is now down and out, living in misery.  However, when Fung meets Sing on the street of Hong Kong, and sees how he kicks an empty can miles away (literally), Fung realises that here is a golden opportunity for him to regain the dignity and pride he lost long time ago.  Combination of Kung-fu and soccer!  Invincible!!
So, Sing recruits the old pupils he knew when he was training at the temple to make a soccer team.  They are no longer what they were; one is a businessman busy with a cell ohone, another totally unemployed, and so on....  And they seem to have lost the skills they had once until, of course, one day, suddenly, they come back in good shape, ready for fight, game for more.  Meanwhile, Sing meets a girl named Mui (Vicki Zhao), and a romance (but very unusual one) starts to bloom.  My overall impression is, in short, Austin Powers with sports and martial arts.
[WHO IS STEPHEN CHOW?]  Chow has been very popular in Hong Kong since the year 1990, about two years he made his film debut, and he is 40 years old at the time of writing this, but looks much younger and very agile.  His comedies are always filled with incredibly stupid and ridiculous things, often under the very unique situations.  Some of his movies include ""With Love from Beijin"" (1994) ""The God of Cookery"" (1996), and many others, and I hope those titles would tell you what you see in those funny films.  Always stupid and powerful, often with extraordinary  parodies, his films give you dynamic gags with improvised atomosphere.  Though the film often lacks a coherent story, and his character is not always amiable, finally you come to like him.
[ABOUT THIS FILM] As I said, ""Kung-Fu Soccer"" is a funny comedy, and it also uses first-rate wire-actions and CG images to create its original world.  The soccer players jump (to the height of more than 10 meters), kick a ball (to make a hole in a concrete wall, or sometimes catches fire, becoming a roaring puma-like shape!), and ... well, about the rest you should see for yourself.  Some of the CGIs are intentionally (and aptly) cheesy (see how villains fly in a browl), but some are surprisingly effective, especailly in the final game scene.  Not ""Titanic"" class, but its use is well-regulated and most importantly, makes lots of funny scenes.
[AND ... TRIVIA]  1) As Stephen Chow is a great fan of Bruce Lee, he makes a reference to this legendary hero in the character of the goal keeper whose orange-colored uniform is that of Lee in his last film ""Game of Death.""  2) Vicki Chao is a famous, very popular idol singer/actress in mainland China, but she never shows her real face.  Three time she appears, but each time she is wearing some make-ups.  This is an in-joke for those who know her, but to some audience Chow's joke may seem to have gone too far.  3) If you're a Hong-Kong film fan, check out the special appearances of Karen Mok with a strange make-up (regular of Chow's films like ""The God of Cookery"" and also seen in Jet Li's  ""Black Mask"") and Vincent Kok (also seen in ""With Love"" and director of Jackie Chan's ""Gorgeous"").
[AND FINALLY...]  The film has first made with the running time of 102 minutes, and then two additional sequences are made to make it 109 minutes (I saw the latter one in Japan).  However, it has been reported that for the US release Miramax decided to cut extensively the Asian version, so you may keep that in mind.  But, though I hate those changes done to the films, I think, as far as this case goes, the cuts would not affect the total effect of the film very much (I admit some parts of the original version was, to me, a little unnecessary or ineffective) because the film itself is way too funny.  Well, anyway, that's for the record.
