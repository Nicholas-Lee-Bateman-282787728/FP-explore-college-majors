8693379,5,B00QYZJC9A,"Unlike most people, I don't need immediate gratification to be entertained and by cheap theatrics and overblown CGI. The concept is solid (within the fantasy genre) and the acting is fine, especially considering the actor playing Catherine doesn't have an extensive background in film, but no doubt does have some theatrical credits under her belt. It's not an overly elaborate script and concentrates primarily on a conversation between the last two beings on Earth.  If you're looking for something similar to the hipster, frat-boy vampire genre, you won't like this.  If you liked ""Let the Right One In"", you may like this.",1532649600,,626,5.127450980392157
8693380,1,B00QYZJC9A,"Like most people, I didn't like this film.

No talking for the first 10 minutes. Strike 1. Am I invited to the movie? It's filmed in the dark. Again, if you wanted me to see the movie, wouldn't it be lit? Strike 2. So it's like some parking garage. I guess there's like an apocalypse above, they were not clear. For 10 minutes this woman looks at a stupid tube, with a blinking red light on it. A shriveled weak vampire eventually, finally, after like forever comes out. They talk for an hour plus whether humans or vampires are worse. He was really weak. He basically lost slap fights with her. She beats the heck out of him and leaves him. Then he finds a suitcase with a bag of 30 year old blood and, thankfully, the movie ends. Maybe he drank it and got strong, maybe the dead man's blood would kill him, we have no idea. We're given no idea. So I'd give the insanely boring and stupid plot as strike 3.

Oh, and then some heavy set naked people showed up, for like 60 seconds, no idea what that was about. It's basically 2 actors that can't act, except for 1 minute of random naked people.

It's like a vampire movie, less any suspense, fear or really any emotions other than boredom and the sense of wasting time. No good plot, it doesn't cause any emotions other than boredom, it's badly lit, not a lot of talking and virtually zero action (except for pathetic slap fights). So basically, it's a vampire movie in title only.",1527552000,,1431,4.332089552238806

8693384,4,B00QYZJC9A,"Aeon: The Last Vampyre On Earth is a taut melodrama with some pretty intense suspense. The bulk of which hinges on the ability of the two actors portraying the nightmarish colloquy during the devastating end of the world. An ability which comes through very well due to the commitment the actors give to these two characters. The back-and-forth coupled with the chilling, dingy surrounding makes for one heck of an atmospheric thriller. At times the character of Aeon seems to surpass Catherine in delivering some mesmerizing confab but the two really bring the viewer in to the story completely. It is worth mentioning that Aeon is truly refreshing as a throwback to a gothic, non-romanticized vampire in this story. No hunky, ultra-fab, trendy vamp here, just a terrifying, primal creature far superior in knowledge and ability.

Now the production and effects in Aeon: The Last Vampyre On Earth is on the low budget side but executed with enough passion and vision that it never takes from the over all visual concept. The action is on a very low level as well with most of the chills and suspense relying on dramatic accentuation combined with sound effects-which at times made me jump. There are moments that the story falters somewhat toward indulgence but never completing reaches the point to become unwatchable. Mostly the film is a classic and timeless allegory of humanity and morality. Overall Aeon: The Last Vampyre On Earth is a very cool, and captivating melodrama, one that has me believing that it is worthy of some theatrical stage production in a small off Broadway sort of way.",1432512000,,1597,4.936802973977695
8693385,1,B00QYZJC9A,"I might be able to watch the movie. This looks more like a live video feed from the 60's over rabbit ears.
I have no idea why this cost so much, or why I purchased it without doing some research.
Possibly, it might be good ""cult classic"" style movie, but I may never know. What little I did see, was over done (for my taste)

So if you can get a preview, you might like it, but for the money, I would buy something else.
For some reason, I paid over double the current price ($11.99 now)",1426032000,,487,4.020618556701031
