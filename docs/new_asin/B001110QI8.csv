3058002,5,B001110QI8,"My daughter has been in love with Hi-5 ever since the first episode, so it's great to have the DVDs. I have to admit I probably enjoy them as much as my daughter. Great item for pre-schoolers.",1207526400,,192,4.216216216216216
3058003,5,B001110QI8,"My girls LOVE Hi5, but it is on too early in the morning for them here. Having the videos are great!! I was so happy to find them on Amazon!
The Easter Bunny left 5 of them for my girls and we have already watched 4 (Easter was just yesterday!)  They'll probaly watch the 5th one before the end of the day!",1206316800,,306,3.935483870967742
3058004,3,B001110QI8,"My 2 and 5 year old love Hi-5 and we have all of the recent dvds. They are all more of a compilation of episodes rather than exact episodes from the theme. We just received the Animal Adventures, and it is set up the same way. While the kids enjoy it, I feel the editing is not very good. Like another reviewer said, the transitions from skit to theme song are poor and the song is louder than the skits. My 5 year old noticed it and thought that the dvd was skipping. They don't seem to mind it though. The rest of the dvd seems fine.",1206316800,,535,4.009345794392523
3058005,4,B001110QI8,We now own three of the Hi-5 DVDs and this is probably one of the best.  The only problem I have with it is that they repeated two songs from other DVDs and the transition to these song is quite poor.,1205539200,,200,3.8780487804878048
3058006,4,B001110QI8,I support the idea of this kind of shows because are very educated for my child.,1205107200,,80,4.0625
3058007,5,B001110QI8,My 3 yr old loves this series.  We have purchased every DVD we can find.  The songs are not annoying.  The 'kids' are professional singers who are engaging and captivating.  The neighborhood kids are all about Hi5 right now.  Highly recommend trying one!,1203292800,,254,4.813953488372093
3058008,4,B001110QI8,"My child is almost addicted to this show, so I didn't regret for buying it, but the editorial review said that it contains ""Ready or not"" and ""Living in a rainbow"" and that is not true. This dvd comes with ""So many animals"", ""Underwater discovery"" and ""North, South, East and West"". For me that makes a little bit of a problem because i'm trying to get all the songs with the few dvd's at possible ;).

Mi hija est fascinada con este programa, por lo que no me arrepiento de haber comprado el DVD, pero lo hice porque la Editorial indicaba que este disco contena las canciones ""Ready or Not"" y ""Living in a rainbow"", pero eso no es correcto, las canciones que si contiene son: ""So many animals"", ""Underwater discovery"" y ""North, South, East and West"". El nico problema que esto me trajo es que me resultar ms difcil conseguir todos las canciones en pocos DVD's ;)",1229212800,2,934,4.4941176470588236
3058009,5,B001110QI8,"Olivia is one.  She can watch this very fun, active and musical program over and again.  Hi-5 is an award winning troupe which, I believe, no longer performs.  Even the wife and I enjoy the video.",1223510400,,196,4.388888888888889
3058010,5,B001110QI8,Hi-5 is a great DVD for kids.  My 19 month old daughter cannot get enough.  They are very educational and get the kids up and moving!!!,1220140800,,135,4.153846153846154

3058012,4,B001110QI8,My kids love this video.  They sing and dance. It is one of the few that keeps the peace with both of them.  I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old. I would order another Hi-5 DVD again.,1213142400,,184,3.4634146341463414
3058013,4,B001110QI8,"My daughter loves this DVD.  It keeps her attention, and allows me to get a few things done.  I don't mind the songs either.  The tunes are catchy. I like that all the segments are about animals.  The editing of the video is poor.",1212278400,,230,4.159090909090909
3058014,5,B001110QI8,"Both my kids ages 3 and 1 love Hi-5, but this DVD instantly became their favourite.  So much fun for them and extended play is great for long car rides.  Also, not one of these kids DVDs that gets annoying for parents to listen to over and over.",1212278400,,245,4.083333333333333
3058015,5,B001110QI8,"My daughter loves to watch Hi-5 on TV. Now she can enjoy them whenever she wants. She also loves animals, so this particular Hi-5 DVD is great for her. She dances like a penguin, mumbles the animals' names, and ""sings"" the songs (she is only 1.5 years old). All in all, she has a great time every time she watches this DVD.",1211241600,,323,4.225806451612903

Had I known this I would have picked a different one with more songs we didn't already have. There's also some places that are horribly edited and one song even makes a loud scratching sound before it comes on. This isn't an issue with all of Hi-5's DVDs, just this particular one.",1451433600,,423,4.234567901234568
8239739,5,B001110QI8,Love Hi-5! my 15 year old use to watch them all the time. I love the skits and songs. I bought this for my 8 year old. WE were watching them on You tube but I wanted a DVD!  They are so adorable and I am keen to this group and not another season group.,1450742400,,252,3.581818181818182
8239740,5,B001110QI8,i had this dvd for my first daughter 5 years ago i could not find it recently for my 2nd daughter shes 1! until i looked on here and she loooooves it! so glad i found it!,1387238400,,170,3.6216216216216215

8239742,4,B001110QI8,Great items for kids and parents. Sent them off to other family members to enjoy and share with their kids.,1355356800,,107,4.4
8239743,5,B001110QI8,"i love this movie i kept asking my mom to get this movie and she finally found it on Amazon she ordered it and it showed up 3 days later
that's cool",1318291200,,148,3.65625
8239744,5,B001110QI8,"There are many volumes in this set and they are all excellent and wholesome.  Volume 5 is one of my favorites! Our grandchildren from age 6 months through preschool, are spellbound as they listen to the music and watch the wonderful animation and dancing. Of all the DVD's they own, the Hi-5 series is ALWAYS  what they want to watch.  This DVD is equally enjoyable for adults, though children through age 6 and even older would enjoy it.  It is especially good as children are encouraged by the jivey beat to move to the music and not just be spectators. The young actors and actresses do a great job involving the audience, and real children and animals often interact with the cast.",1253923200,,685,4.590163934426229
8239745,3,B001110QI8,"My daughter loves Hi5 and this DVD. The songs and dances are fun. She can watch it all day (she does actually...). For the entertainment value I'd give it 5 stars. However, I was also expecting some educational element to it - you know, like Barney or Sesame Street but with more fun hip music and dancing. I was a little disappointed because it is primarily about entertaining kids and not about any targeted teaching. For that I gave it 3 stars. Perhaps it has something to do with what other reviews have indicated about poor editing and that `the DVD seems to be a compilation of episodes rather than exact episodes'. Perhaps that's why it seems choppy to me and lacks any targeted teaching.",1252800000,2,695,4.568
8239746,5,B001110QI8,"This DVD is great. My son loves High 5 and this video is perfect. There are so many songs and lots of animals. Highly, highly recommended!",1239840000,,138,4.346153846153846
8239747,5,B001110QI8,...she got addicted to Hi-5 after this DVD. I had to take it away ...she only gets to watch it on Saturday morning .... For parents -- not annoying as other kiddie DVDs. Seems to me all of the music is recycled 80's dance music.,1232323200,,228,4.088888888888889
