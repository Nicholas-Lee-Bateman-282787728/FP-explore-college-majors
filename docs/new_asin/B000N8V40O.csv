8601938,4,B000N8V40O,"""The Dragon--Buddha's Touch"" starts out at Emeishan, one of the four sacred mountains of Chinese Buddhism, located in Sichuan province in western China.  Historically, Emeishan was once part of eastern Tibet, and had 50-70 Buddhist monasteries during the Ming and Quing period, most of them located near the top of the mountain.  Emeishan was sought-out by monks because of its tranquility and pristine beauty.  The patron saint of Mt. Emei is Samantabhadra (Puxian) who is shown riding on the back of an elephant.  The film depicts monasteries, mountain paths, pagodas, shrines, temple gardens, and statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas.  At BaoGuo monastery, at the base of the mountain, we are shown a large incense brazier burning hundreds of incense sticks and emitting huge plumes of smoke.  The ""Crouching Tiger Monastery"", located far in the woods, is very quiet and inhabited by Nuns. It includes a seven-meter copper pagoda and beautiful gardens, and offers bed and breakfast accommodations for pilgrims.  The ""10,000 Year Monastery"", located near the top of the mountain, can be accessed via cable car.  An alternative mode of transportation is via palanquin or sedan chair over the winding mountain path, carried by one coolie in front and another behind.  The path is traveled day and night by Buddhist pilgrims.  80% of the statues on Mt. Emei were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  Many of the Chinese monasteries look quite similar to one another, and some of the statues and buildings depicted in the film are of recent (post-cultural revolution) manufacture.

Leshan is a city in Sichuan province in Southwest China, to the east of Emeishan.  Leshan is located at the confluence of two rivers, and a giant seated statue of Maitreiya the ""Grand Buddha of Sichuan"" is located on an island across the rivers, facing the city.  There is a second large reclining Buddha in the area, 170 meters in length, and a park with 3,000 Buddha statues, many of them modern or imported from Southeast Asia.  On the road up the hill to the Grand Buddha, there is a temple with 1,000 terracotta arhats having a wide variety of facial expressions - laughing, angry, fearsome, quizzical - all arranged around a central meditation-like hall with a main statue of a Buddha seated on a peacock.  The main tourist attraction is the Grand Buddha of Sichuan.  At 71 meters in height, it is currently the tallest Buddha statue in the world (following the destruction of the giant Buddha statue in Bamiyan, Afghanistan in 2000).  Construction of the Grand Buddha of Sichuan started in 730 and took 90 years to complete.  One Buddhist monk made tremendous efforts to finance it and gouged his eyes out to protest the actions of corrupt local officials who pocketed money earmarked for the statue.  The statue's ears are 8.5 meters tall, its toenails 1.5 meters long, and it was originally housed in an enclosure destroyed during wars of the Ming dynasty.

Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, located north of Emeishan and Leshan, is a modern city of 10,000,000 people, and served as a base for the Flying Tigers during World War II.  Chengdu was capital to the Han Shu Dynasty during the period of the Three Kingdoms.  Perhaps the most unusual feature in the Chengdu film sequence is the ""Temple to the Minister of War,"" which houses a large gallery of statue portraits of the generals and prime ministers who established Chengdu as the capital of the empire.  Also shown is a temple to Lao Tsu, the ""Monastery of the Green Ram,"" and the Wen-Shu Monastery, dating from the Tang Dynasty.  The past twenty years has seen an opening up of China and restoration of religious freedom, so that there are many more practicing Buddhists today than there were at the time of the Cultural Revolution.  Also depicted in the film are the tea houses which were closed during the Cultural Revolution.  The tea houses are places where people traditionally gather to discuss politics, and during the Cultural Revolution they were closed as hotbeds of sedition.  They were reopened under Deng Xiaoping.  Probably the most ironic scene in this film is a statue of Chairman Mao, in downtown Chengdu, standing in front of a wall blazing with capitalist neon advertizing signs.

""The Dragon-Buddha's Touch"" is accompanied by a low key voice-over historical narrative.  There is no gabby tour guide standing at the center of the scene.  This is a low-budget tourist film, and includes shots of local food and local street scenes.  Like the other Flying Monk films, it is a good film for anyone planning a trip to Asia or simply interested in studying the history of Buddhism China.",1264118400,,4652,4.945945945945946
