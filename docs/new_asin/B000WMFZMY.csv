2985901,5,B000WMFZMY,"The first of Anthony Mann and Samuel Bronston's ambitious and intelligent epics, El Cid has to boast the most gorgeous use of the widescreen ever - the Cid and Chimene's first meeting makes the most of every inch of the screen, while Robert Krasker's gliding camera is remarkably sympathetic to screen format, architecture and exteriors alike. Indeed, the whole film displays Mann's typically intelligent use of location, here in interiors (often his weak spot) as well - during their bleak wedding feast, he keeps Chimene and the Cid at a distance, the staircase where he killed her father (never a great start to any marriage) prominent between them; and while the good king's court is filled with colour, light and people, once the weak Alfonso assumes power it is a dark, empty hall. Despite some occasional over emphatic Christian imagery - when he's not standing in front of a cross, he's literally carrying one - this spectacular account of Spain's greatest hero uniting Christians and Moors alike against a common enemy, making friends of enemies and teaching his weak king the path to greatness by example manages to put a surprisingly human face on the myth of the perfect knight: the Cid's quest to do the honourable and right thing brings him little joy and much sorrow and even his resolve is nearly broken by his burden.

Charlton Heston when he was still an icon instead of a political target is one of the few actors who could carry off such a part, and he does it very well despite his curious conviction that Mann's superb direction was below par. The pomp and splendour never swamps the drama, and the setpiece duel for Calahora still stands out as one of the most remarkable and remarkably vicious screen swordfights of all time. A great score from Miklos Rozsa and good support from John Fraser and Douglas Wilmer too, although Andrew Cruickshank's portly King's champion implies that there was something seriously amiss in the kingdom long before the warring infantas succeeded to the throne!",1198886400,11,2014,4.888888888888889
2985902,5,B000WMFZMY,"This 1961 film has long been regarded as one of the finest of Hollywood's huge historical epics, and it is certainly one of the most intelligent ones. It stands alongside BEN HUR and A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS as an example of history-as-entertainment. The age-old legend of the Spanish hero known as ""El Cid"" has come down to us in poems and plays, and this film presents us with the best distillation of fact and fiction drawn from those sources.

Director Anthony Mann assembled an impressive cast, gorgeous locations, and awesome battle scenes to tell the tale, but he and his colleagues did not forget the most important elements--a strong script and a touching, believable love story. Charlton Heston has never been more impressive than he is here, and Sophia Loren's Chimene is one of her finest roles. The two stars are perfect together, with able support from an A-list international cast. Add to this the stunning cinematography and Miklos Rozsa's majestic musical score, and you have a grand-scale, sweeping saga of love, valor and chivalry. EL CID is a feast for the eye and ear. Highly recommended.",1196899200,27,1106,4.882978723404255
2985903,5,B000WMFZMY,"It has been a very long wait indeed for a proper, high resolution 2 disc anamorphic DVD of this epic medieval tale of passion and chivalry.  The final results are breathtaking.  The transfer is stunning and the sound is rich and full.  This is rousing entertainment on the grandest scale.

It's hard to understand why this film took so long to arrive on DVD.  Perhaps, as some have suggested, the subject matter has been an issue in our over-sensitive, shrinking world of religious violence.  Or our discomfort with nebulous concepts of love, forgiveness and peace.  But most likely a matter of rights and licensing issues.

The relevance of this extraordinary film remains current and is a monumental artistic achievements of world cinema.  On a personal level, this terrific film provoked me into thinking about how belief systems -- especially about the nature of God (or Allah) -- benefit or harm our world.

The essence of the conflict between warring Castilians and Moors and an invading Muslim threat is unflinching in the opening scene as the North African holy warrior  Ben Yussuf quotes ""the Prophet"" as promising to conquer the world in the name of Allah.

But the real conflict is the idea that there can be peace -- and perhaps even love -- between those who hate.  This is exemplified in the troubled and intimate story of Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) and Ximena (Sophia Loren).  It begins simply enough with a knight on his way to meet his bride when destiny forces a detour.

El Cid, the legendary hero of Spain was a real person named Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar.  He lived around 1035 A.D.  Although he spent much of his time fighting on the side of the Moors, he became identified as the best incarnation of the true Castilian Christian spirit.  His name came from the Arabic ""sayyid"" meaning ""lord"" or ""chief.""

Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are perfectly cast as larger than life figures of flesh and blood.  Their reported confllcts on-set probably added a degree of on-screen realism.  They are wonderful together.  Too bad Heston and Loren were not able to do a full, shared commentary at the time of the transfer.

Anthony Mann's direction is robust and true to the theme.  The movie has a fine sense of composition that the terrific on-location cinematography only enhances.  Numerous action-filled vistas fill the screen, richly detailed and beautifully photographed.  No CGI elements can rival the texture of a real place captured on celluloid.

The incredible flow of stunning images and the magnificent Miklos Rozsa score are a reminder of what movies can do when they tackle a worthy tale and go all the way.

EL CID is about a real hero who selflessly followed his moral compass.  It's also  a reasonably true adapataion of the essence of the numerous medieval tales, plays and poems -- unlike the mangling of both poem and hero ""Beowulf"" in the recent movie of the same name.

Amazing that this magnificent paradox of a tale -- after all, El Cid was a warrior and peacemaker -- continues to be told for a thousand years.

The extras on the second disc include interesting featurettes on producer Sam Bronston, director Anthony Mann and composer Miklos Rozsa as well as vintage radio interviews with Heston and Loren and a ""making of"" documentary.

The last scenes are a fitting epitaph for Charlton Heston the man and the actor.  His passing is truly the end of an era.

This great movie deserves a place in any digital library.  Don't miss it.

Highest recommendation.",1195344000,76,3500,4.821848739495798

2986207,5,B000WMFZMY,"Authentic. This movie by Bronston studios is a tour de force of Spanish history. It gives any epic movie a run for its money, and probably ranks in the top five of all time. The story of el cid is not well known today. However history is not taught in schools; let that be. This movie is a great introduction to the hero of Spain. If set designs and costumes are your fetish, el cid has it in spades. All of the sets and locations were meticulously researched and hand made. The extras were Spanish military commissioned by Franco. All of this can be derived from the DVD extras which are as good as the movie itself.  The story of bronston studios is worth the price of admission alone.

I have to say that after the second viewing of this film, there are a couple updates. First of all, this is movie is a tremendous feat of acting and artistry. The supporting cast is world class (as in shakespearean level). Heston is great and fits the role like a glove, and this maybe his best ever performance. Loren is fiery as well. However, if you pay attention to the other actors, then you will see just how much time was spent on talent acquisition. You will learn that many of the sets were authentic re-creations which is kind of mind-blowing, considering the detail and color. The actual shots of castles and Spanish landscapes are phenomenal and sumptuous. This movie is particularly spectacular because of the technicolor. The costumes and set designs are so elaborate and bright, that they demand a fine art type of film treatment. Moreover, this movie actually does a good job of representing the church and its dominant presence in Spain. This is a must watch movie for anyone. My only qualm is that it must be viewed on the big screen for full effect.",1419897600,,1757,4.522012578616352

2986275,4,B000WMFZMY,"""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend""

From, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (available from Amazon)

""El Cid"" is one of the most literate and intelligent of the 70 mm epics made from the mid 1950's (""Around The World in 80 Days"") to the late 1960's (2001: A Space Odyssey). But it is only part history, and a lot of legend.

First, about Technirama. Technirama was one of those wide screen, big image cinematography systems developed in the wake of CinemaScope and Three-film Cinerama. This included Todd-AO, VistaVision, Super Panavision 70, Ultra-Panavison 70 and Ultra-Panavision 70-based Single Film Cinerama. Technirama was very similar to VistaVision, as that the camera original passed through the camera gate horizontally, rather than vertically. This resulted in a ""double-wide"" frame, that is a 35 mm frame that was twice as wide as regular 35 mm frame, exposed vertically, creating a camera negative that was almost the same width as a 70 mm frame, and thereby excellent for making 70 mm release prints, via intermediate elements. When a film shot in Technirama 35 was released in 70 mm, the system was titled Super Technirama 70.

Frederick M. Frank wrote the first screenplay for ""El Cid"", but it was considered to be not very good. So Philip Yordan, who was sort of a ""supervising screenwriter"" for Samuel Bronston, hired Ben Barzman, an American blacklisted screenwriter living in Europe at the time (Jordan's relationship with Samuel Bronston, and the screenwriters he hired, was somewhat...well...""complex""). Seeking a new approach to the material, Barzman consulted Spain's leading historian and scholar on Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, and his role in the The Spanish Reconquista. He suggested that Barzman read Pierre Corneille's 17th century French play, ""Le Cid"" (which I'm sure is available, in paperback, from Amazon). Barzman subsequently used ""Le CId"" for the basis of his screenplay. A screenplay that reflected Rodrigo's status a Spain's national hero of the Reconquista. But life is always more complex than the movies, which, by necessity, compress and simplify.

Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar was born circa 1040-1045. He served in the army of Prince Sancho, fighting Moors and other Christian nobility over territory...turf wars. King Ferdinand I is referred to in the film as the king of...Len, Castile and Asturias. However, at the beginning of the 10th century, Asturias was divided into two kingdoms, Len and Galicia. When Ferdinand died, he was succeeded by his older son, Sancho II, who was eventually succeeded by his brother, Alfonso VI, who, in 1077, declared himself the Emperor of all Spain, half of which, al-Andalus, was still ruled by the Moors. Rodrigo served Alfonso until they had a falling out in 1081, and Alfonso sent Rodrigo into exile. Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar then became a warlord and mercenary in eastern Spain, fighting for both Christians and Moors. Alfonso's army was defeated at Sarajas, on October 23, 1086, and, as the film depicts, Alfonso was wounded and barely escaped the battlefield with his life. His enemy were the Almoravids, radical Muslims out to ""purify"" al-Andalus, under the leadership of Yusuf ibn Tashufin, Ben Yusuf in the movie. (What is past is present). But, unlike the timeline of the film, the Battle of Sarajas was not fought just prior to Rodrigo's siege and conquest of Valencia.

Rodrigo laid siege to Valencia in 1093, a siege that lasted over a year. However, unlike the film, he most certainly did not use his catapults to fling loaves of bread into the city. He starved Valencia into surrender (in 1094), to the point that there were rumors of cannibalism in the city. An Almoravid army counterattacked, but Rodrigo defeated the army at Cuerte, 5 miles outside of Valencia. He was not wounded in this battle, nor did his mounted corpse lead his army to victory. Rodrigo then declared himself the ruler of the independent kingdom of Valencia, a de facto king. He ruled Valencia for 5 years, until his death in 1099. Then his widow Ximena ruled Valencia for 3 years, until an Almoravid army was about to retake the city in 1102. Ximena burned as much of Valencia as could be burned, rather than letting the city fall intact to the Moors.

The Moors were not completely driven out of Spain, until the Fall of Granada...in 1492, a date more famous for another event.

The title ""El Cid"" is popularly though to be from the Arabic word for ""Lord"". But that Arabic word ""sayyidi"" is more accurately defined as meaning ""chief"" or ""boss"". So...print (or in this case, film) the legend, and the result is an excellent epic film!

PS: Amazon's ""El Cid"" page states that there are no Special Features with the ""Two Disc Deluxe Edition"" of ""El Cid"". Well...my copy of the ""Two Disc Deluxe Edition"" of ""El Cid"" has a bunch of Special Features on the second disc . All of them excellent and informative...Hollywood Conquers Spain: The Making of ""El Cid""; Samuel Bronston: The Epic Journey of a Dreamer; Behind the Camera: Anthony Mann and ""El Cid""; Mikls Rzsa: Maestro of the Movies; Preserving Our Legacy: Gerry Byrne on Film Preservation and Restoration; Trailer Gallery. If Amazon is selling the same Two-Disc Deluxe Edition that I purchased when the DVD was first released (and which I very have purchased from Amazon), then Amazon needs to correct their Special Features misinformation.

Amazon's ""El Cid"" information lists the Aspect Ratio as 2.35:1. This is the Aspect Ratio for Technirama 35 mm release prints, the same anamorphic aspect ratio as CinemaScope and Panavision 35 mm. The Super Technirama 70 Aspect Ratio is 2.21:1, not as wide, but still a much larger screen image. 2.21:1 is the same release print aspect ratio as Todd-AO, Super Panavision 70 (non anamorphic print) and Ultra-Panavision 70 (anamorphic print). With Ultra-Panavision-derived Single Film Cinerama having an aspect ration of 2.70:1 to 2.75:1. And that's the cinematography geek aspect ratio information.",1413158400,2,5963,5.0385395537525355

2986410,3,B000WMFZMY,"This epic 1961 historical film, directed by Anthony Mann, has all the staples of the swashbuckling war film genre. We get Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren in a feisty romance, well-staged battle sequences with hundreds of extras, themes of honor and heroism, and religious conflict between Catholics and Muslims in 11th century Spain. As Rodrigo ""El Cid"" (the Lord) Diaz, Heston fights to unite feudal Spain -- Jew, Christian, Muslim -- in battle against fanatical North African Muslim armies of the Almoravid Empire. Known as the ""compassionate warrior,"" Rodrigo gets the standard Heston treatment here, bland but reliable. The film was Oscar nominated and lauded as a great spectacle upon its release to theaters. Director Martin Scorsese, quoted on the front of this DVD box, lists it among his favorite films. A lot of the macho posturing in the movie does remind one of Scorsese, who does ""tough guys"" better than almost anyone else.

Unfortunately, ""El Cid"" exhibits all the excesses of the epic war genre in addition to many of its virtues. At three hours and 15 minutes, it's an impossibly bloated film that often progresses at a plodding pace. It revels in medieval politics, feudal ceremonies, jousting, paternalistic courtship rituals, and dueling, to the point that it feels more generic than epic at times. Redeemed somewhat by the performances, the film sustains some degree of dramatic interest through the smoldering love-hate relationship of Heston's Rodrigo and Loren's Dona Ximena. Heston gives a surprisingly restrained and relaxed performance, coming at a high point in his career, and it meshes well with Loren. The passionate love-revenge triangle is a high point of the plot. But the film's generic action set pieces lack the iconic imagery of Heston's chariot race in Ben Hur or parting of the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments, to name two examples, and the film is too full of its own machismo to justify the three-plus hour running length.

This two-disc DVD release features a sparkling digital transfer that does ample justice to the best film that ""El Cid"" could wish for. The second disc is loaded with special features. In my book, it's not the greatest epic film ever made, but it's a pleasant diversion and an indispensable viewing experience for any fan of Charlton Heston epics.",1401580800,,2313,5.052356020942408

It is filmed in Cinemascope and has exquisite sets. One feels like one is in old Spain. The actors handle their roles with passion, honesty and historical accuracy. This is a wonderful film.

If one feels strong emotions between Heston and Loren it is because Heston felt slighted that Loren had been paid $1M while he was paid much less. Also, Loren was not aged through the film while Heston was aged and scarred. The only criticism I have of this DVD transfer is the sound balancing.

It places a particular emphasis on the fact that is true that El Cid was open to work with both Muslims and Christians and was inspired and respected by all, something that even in our own time has proven to be difficult all over the world. Hence we have a historical figure that was beyond his time and ours too. The romantic story between Jimena and El Cid also presents the challenges that a wife has to endure when married with a national hero and how much she had to suffer because of that. The epic scenes filmed in Spain are considered the best ever created for a movie and the castle where they were filmed is a tourist attraction near Valencia.

El Cid is a 1961 medieval epic based on the legends of Rodrigo de Bivar, the Spanish warrior who fought for the Spaniards and Moors during the 9th century. It was directed by Anthony Mann and stars Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren in the leading roles.

Charlton Heston is one of my all-time favorite actors. He brings just the right amount of warmth and range to his roles. I don't see why so many professional critics think he was a bad bad actor and that his Oscar win for Ben-Hur was one of the judges' worst decisions. I thought he was fiery and intense and subtle and quiet at just the right moments. His love for his mother, sister and fianc, faith in God and hatred for Messala was so strong and real and he brought layers of details to the role. Every performance I've seen (The Greatest Story Ever Told, Ben-Hur and El Cid.) is a gem. He always plays strong, devoted, courageous men and that's why I love him. His Rodrigo is a warrior of uncompromising integrity. Throughout the film, he treats even the people that wronged him (King Alfonso, Princess Urracca, Count Ordonez and even his wife at one point) with kindness, loyalty and friendship. Each one of these individuals is baffled as to why he would do such a thing.

Sophia Loren's performance as Rodrigo's wife Chimene is a little uneven. There are times when she goes into self-conscious frowns and says her lines like she was sight reading the script but she gets better as the movie progresses. Her first few scenes are rather dull and passive but I think the scene where she and Rodrigo are in the barn was well done and the part where she tells Alfonso off at the convent ""Would you punish the man who is Spain's only hope? It takes more than courage to be a king."" was good too. Probably her finest moment is towards the end of the first half where she begs her husband's forgiveness for trying to murder him. The resonance in her voice and look on her face (especially her eyes) says a lot.

Herbert Lom is terrific as the Islamic terrorist, especially in his first scene at the beginning of the movie. Frank Thring is very good in his very short part as the cowardly Moorish king Al Kadir. Raf Vallone (Count Ordonez) makes the slow gradual transformation from a back stabbing traitor to a loyal friend. John Fraser is excellent as the cruel, prideful, power-hungry King Alfonso and Genevieve Page as his sister Urraca should have had more than a few lines.

The art direction/set design and costumes are magnificent, particularly the interior of the convent and palaces and what were the Academy smoking giving those awards to West Side Story instead? Robert Krasker's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Miklos Rozsa's music contains beautiful melodies and rich orchestration. He is definitely award worthy but he had already won Best Original Score for Ben Hur two years ago so it's understandable the Academy wasn't going to award him again so soon.

All in all El Cid is fine, solid entertainment and at times inspiring.",1383523200,,3231,4.746880570409982

He fought and died for what he believed in and in so doing became a legend:  ""The Cid"".

2986503,4,B000WMFZMY,"I'm old enough to remember when El Cid was first released. At that time Bronston had 2 major movies in distribution simultaneously: ""King of Kings"" and ""El Cid"".  For some reason I clearly remember the newspaper reviews of the two movies - almost verbatim. Something like this - ""King of Kings; a crumb of a film about a pyramid of a man.  El Cid; a pyramid of a film about a crumb of a man.""
El Cid is a series of ""spectacular"" scenes, held together by a loose plot and a love interest. The reason the word ""spectacular"" is in quotes is because statistically they meet the requirements of spectacle, having the requisite no. of extras milling around, fighting each other, cheering, or each waving one regulation Bronston cabbage to show how much they love El Cid for giving them food. Bronston desperately wanted to thrill his audiences, and he always does (or did) come up with some thrilling moments.  But like Wagnerian opera, the thrills are short lived, and quickly decay into schmaltz or tedium.  He was terrific on opening shots. He (and Anthony Mann) would choose just the right light and just the right angles for the sweeping Technirama 70 format, and produce images that stirred the soul. The voiceover narration - quiet and dignified - would set the scene in broad Homeric blank verse (""... and there came a time when Ben Yussuf and his men ..."") Miklos Rozsa would pump it up with a few ""look out here it comes"" opening bars ... and then ... then it all fell apart when the actors opened their mouths and spoke their cliched lines that sounded like they'd been taken from an end-of-term grade-school production.
Actually I could never understand why Bronston was so taken with Miklos Rozsa.  His scores are cloying and unimaginative.  Presumably his name on the credits was money in the bank.  If you turn off the picture and just listen to the music you have no idea if you're watching Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, or King of Kings. They are completely interchangeable.  He did manage to infuse the El Cid score with some Spanish and Moorish themes, but believe me, he is no Georges Bizet. They still sound like loud Rozsa schlock.  Dimitri Tiomkin would have been a far better choice.
Despite all my negativity I have a great sentimental attachment for El Cid, just because it is unique and outrageous, and because Bronston was such a character;  the nephew of Leon Trotsky, no less.  Far better men than I, including Marty Scorcese have professed their love for this flawed gem.

2986516,2,B000WMFZMY,"I really wanted to love EL CID. But somewhere in the ongoing and laborious pomp and circumstance of the Spanish court sequences in the first act it dawned on me that there wasn't much behind the facade. It was watchable, somewhat entertaining, but unfortunately introduced audiences to 1960s Charlton Heston -- while always superb whatever film, whatever scene -- that would see other movies like THE AGONY & THE ECSTASY and MAJOR DUNDEE, far cries from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and BEN-HUR.

There have been comments about the fluctuating sound in the restoration print and rightly so. This may not be entirely the restored version's fault, since the film's director, Anthony Mann, later oversaw a similar bombastic earache, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Here, though, everything feels fairly by the numbers when it should have been magnificent, especially in 70mm.

Finally, a word on Sophia Loren. Is she miscast? Certainly many would argue her merits to the film, but the misfire may more be in the lack of chemistry between her and Heston. Indeed, a quick scroll thru IMDb trivia for EL CID reveals a strong dislike the two leads harbored for each other. There's a lot of star wattage to go around in big budget epics like these, but something had to give -- and here it was the integral chemistry between the two that needed to carry the emotion of the film. Because it fails, so does this movie.",1372723200,,1398,4.796680497925311

It has the feel of a 60s -70s epic (""The Longest Day"" comes to mind) in which a potpourri of marquee stars pass rapidly before you in an effort to assure them of their screen time. However, these ""stars"" were hardly marquee and their characters did little to develop the story. It is poorly plotted and paced. (Yes, plotted. Although ostensibly a historical film, it bears little resemblance to what is actually known about ""The Cid."")Worse, action abounds, but motivations are rarely clear. It is a drowsy time.

The second half is much more fun.  The story line tightens significantly and Charlton Hesston's acting soars. His performance during the humiliation of King Alfonso and the capture and subsequent defense of Valencia is Shakespearean, absolutely worthy of the great Olivier.

I give the first half two stars, the second five, an average of 3.5, which I must, reluctantly, round to 3 because the first half  takes more air time than the second.",1366588800,,1182,5.01530612244898

2986543,5,B000WMFZMY,"Charlton Heston. He was larger than life.
Standing over 6 feet, and broad enough to match, with chiseled features and a chin Bruce Campbell would envy, Charlton's gravelly voice and intense charisma all added up to a man born to play characters larger than life: Moses, Ben-Hur, George Taylor, and, of course, El Cid.

And what a performance he puts on!

The word epic is the most misused word in the English language. On social media sites, and especially Youtube, ignorant people use ""epic"" to refer to anything that remotely amuses them or is considered out of the ordinary. That is not the true meaning of epic. Epic means ""heroic; majestic; impressively great"", epic means The Ten Commandments, Lawrence of Arabia, and War and Peace.

Epic means El Cid.

Have you ever seen a good battle scene in film? The Battle for Hoth in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Aqaba in Lawrence of Arabia, The Battle of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers? You haven't seen anything until you've seen El Cid. Tens of thousands of extras, hundreds of horses, countless swords, huge siege engines, giant castles.
All right here!

What a sweeping spectacle El Cid is! Back when there were ACTUAL epics. Not CGI. Everything you see on the screen: giant battles, deadly jousts, tragic romance, giant castles, and amazing actors. Are all right there.

2986545,4,B000WMFZMY,"I enjoy this movie EL CID.  One of Charlton Heston's good hero movies about the legendary medieval Spanish knight Rodrigo, an almost ""pure knight"", and Sophia Loren as Ximena his fiance and later relunctant wife who although must ""hate"" him due to him killing her father.  Great plot and a great villian make this a movie to enjoy.  Herbert Lom plays an ""evil"" Muslim Warlord and leader who wants to rid the ""infidels"" Catholic Spaniards out of Spain once and for all.  In the movie, Rodrigo shoes compassion for some Muslim WarChiefs he captures and so his ""nicname"" afterwards is ""Alsayyid"" meaning great lord or chief.  I won't go into the rest of the story since I don't do spoilers.  The music is great, the scenery of Spain is beautiful, and the other actors and actresses do a good job as well.  Okay, now to my complaints about the film.  Ready?

I always feel like this had the potential to be a truely magnificent and timeless film like Heston's other works such as ""Ben Hur"", ""The 10 Commandments"", ""Planet of The Apes"", BUT I think due to some overacting on all the main actors parts, the movie just falls a bit short of that.  I don't know why except maybe the director is at fault in this film.  Herbert Lom and some of the supporting actors are outstanding in this film though.  Plus, I hope they clean up the photography, because when I had this on VHS, the photography was grainy and overdubbing at parts.

Maybe I am being finicky, I just wish I could say this was an OUTSTANDING film instead of a GOOD film.  One of a few movies that could of been truely a well recognized classic but just falls short of its goal.  But hey, it is a good and historical film based on actual events in the history of Spain.

2986558,4,B000WMFZMY,"This Spanish epic is not as good as Ben Hur or The Agony and the Ecstasy, but it's still a little surprising how little you hear of it. After all the cinematography and the score are magnificent. Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren do a pretty good job, though Sophia is--dare I say it?--a little wooden at times (always looks great though, with tears welling up in the eyes at appropriate moments). The biggest problem is probably the screenplay, which includes its share of absurdities First of all, Heston as El Cid is a little too noble for his own good. When he is betrayed and falls into an ambush, he decides to spare the one who set up the attack because he wants no more blood spilt on his wedding day. It seems that he has forgotten all the soldiers who had lost their lives because of this treachery. What about them? Don't they deserve justice? Obviously, there is no way a real warrior of the El Cid type would ever pardon this. However, the greatest absurdity comes at the end with a dead El Cid strapped to his horse galloping off into the Moors with everyone fleeing before him. It seems he will just keep galloping on along the shoreline forever, unable to stop--until (presumably) some hard and immobile object puts an end to his forward career.

2986563,5,B000WMFZMY,although the movie of El Cid was a great story in film. the real story of Rodrigo de Bivar is very Different. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1961. I loved it. I kept asking myself why did they allow Heston to age but kept Sophia young. The real Cid did not die in Valencia as the Movie shows. he went on to live a great Life and died of natural causes in 1066. He had two great Swords that he named Tizada. & colada. His horse was Called Braca Which is Latin for Crazy. His Twin Girls were married off to different men of rich Blood. But the Cid was not happy with this and he let the King know it. It is said that when he went into Battle he would grit his Teeth in excitment. He was loved by his fellow countrymen and he was hailed a Hero of Spain. It pains me so to see that on some of his Statues in Spain they have written some very unkind words. I can only think that some people just have to make trouble where ever you go. But for me the movie of El Cid will remain one of my Favorites. remember movies are for Entertainment. the Director will change the story to show his view on a story and make it interesting.,1298592000,2,1133,3.9304347826086956
2986564,3,B000WMFZMY,"The film's visuals are occasionally stunning, and, while the screenplay by Philip Yordan, Ben Barzman and Fredric M. Frank, from a story by Frank, is solid, one does wonder how differently a true film master like Michelangelo Antonioni would have handles such a film. We never get inside any of the characters because they act upon such a large stage that what they say and do almost does not matter, as it is dwarfed by the seeming weight of history. In a sense, the film is like a Frederic Edwin Church painting, wherein natural forces marginalize the efforts of man. The music score by Mikls Rzsa, was much lauded, but in retrospect, it does not hold up against the visuals of cinematographer Robert Krasker. Interestingly, perhaps the most important technical aspect that succeeds in this film is the editing by Robert Lawrence. Repeatedly, the scenes end before typical Hollywood reveals that hammer a point home, especially in epic films like this. There are dozens of examples, but note the scene where Cid kills Chimene's father. First, we never see the final deed, as both men are behind the staircase when Cid strikes his deathblow. Second, after getting Chimene to agree to avenge his death, we see her turn, to see Cid in darkness under the stairs, but then we get the fade. We never see the typical confrontation between the lovers That is delayed for a few minutes. What this shows is that Mann was handed an elephant, and did his best to leave some sort of imprint of himself on it.

  The film won some awards at the Golden Globes, and Oscars- mostly technical stuff, but it was a smash hit. The film is shown in a 2.20:1 aspect ratio and clocks in at almost three and a quarter hours in length, and comes in 1 three disk DVD package, as part of The Miriam Collection of films. Unfortunately, the film is split at its intermission, and spread across two DVDs. In this day and age, this is a major boner. Even worse is that the audio commentary is also split. The commentary, by Bill Bronston (son of producer Sauel Bronston) and Neal M. Rosendorf, a film historian, is ok, mentioning some of the unfortunate stereotyping that was portrayed, but it's nothing special. Perhaps the most insightful thing mentioned is how the film used Islamic expansion as a metaphor for the Cold War, whereas now it can be read literally, and how Sam Bronston was clueless as to the deeper themes in the film. Disk 1 features radio interviews with Heston and Loren, while Disk 2 has the featurettes. There's a making of featurette, a film on the career of Bronston as a producer, one on Anthony Mann'sd career as a director, one on the music of Mikls Rzsa, a film on film preservation, and a gallery of theatrical trailers. The worst extra feature, though, comes on Disk 3. There is nothing but a lengthy interview with a none too bright evangelist named John Bevere, who spends his whole interview as an apologist for Christianity, as well as spewing bizarre 1950s era ultra-nationalistic tripe, and generally misinterpreting the film. It's an embarrassing feature, and one wonders what connection to the people involved in the DVD this man has, and why he would be featured so prominently in the packaging.

  Overall, El Cid is a terrific popcorn movie to watch, but a film of depth and great art it's not. Akira Kurosawa would have really lifted a project like this into the heavens. These days, all of the thousands of extras would simply be added in via CG, so it is quite impressive to see a film that truly was epic in scope. I also prefer the old method of putting all the credits at the start of the film, and, of course, there's Charlton Heston. Simply put, Heston is the quintessential American Alpha Male Movie Star. John Wayne, Sylvester Stallone, Marlon Brando, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, Rock Hudson. No one really compares, except for, perhaps, Gary Cooper. While this film does not test his acting chops the way Major Dundee did, nor is it as iconic as his roles in Planet Of The Apes nor The Ten Commandments, it may be the role Heston was most suited to play, for it seems that he is never straining, and always in his comfort zone. Regardless, watch El Cid if you want an idea of what the filmgoing experience was, at its best, during the middle of last century.",1283299200,4,4278,4.637203166226913
2986565,5,B000WMFZMY,"ALL I CAN SAY IS AWESOME FILM _ THEY DONT REALLY MAKE LIKE THIS TYPE ANYMORE IN HOLLWOOD.
My background: I am an avid movie buff and will be returning to school to study film, I look to these types of films to educate myself in my filmmmaking pursuits.

El Cid was directed by the extremely talented visionary director Anthony Mann, he also did Fall of the Roman Empire; and the set pieces for that FORE movie were incredible, built from scratch under the direction of Samuel Bronsteen/ the producer.  This type of Director is seldom seen in Hollywood and underappreciated ( and actaully this film was not made in Hollywood, or the U.S.)-- Mr. Mann was a true ""artist."" Too bad he didn't make more epic films.

 In my opinion The only other visionary directors in the industry that are somewhat comparable today would be Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan but I really think Anthony Mann is actually in a seperate class of viisonary directors, along with Cecil B. Demille.  I should mention also John Boorman who I thnk is equal to Anthony Mann (having made the epic film EXCALIBUR)in telling quality stories--Boorman is an incredible director.

THE ACTORS :

Charton Heston gave an incredible performance as the Spaniard Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar, known as El Cid. And Sophia Loren also gives an incredible performance.  All the acting was stellar from beginning to end!

The DVD I purchased has extra features where you learn that in making the film they employed the advisory input from the most noted scholar in Spain at that time who specialized in this specific time period of the history of Spain; so the they tried to make it as an historically accurate reflection of the real events that took place- however they did base many parts of the movie on a famous poem/book written by a French author.

I only wish we had more directors and producers like Mann and Bronsteen still with us today - they left a filmmaking legacy that that is unforgettable and aweinspiring.

In the period in which this film is set Spain is divided between Moors and Christians. Christian kingdoms are gradually gaining the upper hand but the threat of a new Muslim invasion from North Africa hangs over Moor and Christian alike. The harangue of Beni Yusef at the beginning sounds like it could have come right out of an al-Qaida propaganda video.

Charlton Heston plays el Cid, a Spanish noble who is respected by Christian and Moor alike. His is a struggle to fight the invaders while trying to make a king worthy of Spain.

There are alliances and changes in allegiance and even I had trouble remembering which kingdom was which in this fragmented version of Spain. But the movie speaks to honor, courage and nobility and as such is a wonderful movie.",1263254400,4,910,4.675

2986591,4,B000WMFZMY,"When El Cid finally came out in DVD in the US (after having been available in various DVD editions in Europe for years), the quality of the picture and sound really did the film justice--both were outstanding.  Unfortunately, although it says above that this version contains a Spanish-language soundtrack, it does not, and the producers really missed a bet here, in view of the enormous popularity of the legend of El Cid in the Spanish-speaking world.  It is particularly unfortunate because there already exists an extremely good Spanish-language soundtrack on the 2004 Region 2 DVD issued by Divisa Home Video--but this was unfortunately coupled with one of the most awful prints of the film imaginable, and the Divisa print of the film is almost unwatchable, despite the absolutely beautiful and superbly refined Castilian Spanish on its soundtrack.  There is also a (supposedly remastered) 2003 version with a Spanish language track available from Front Row Entertainment, but as I have not seen it I cannot vouch for either the picture quality or the quality of the Spanish language soundtrack.  How long will we have to wait before the Miriam Collection reissues this magnificent version, with digitally remastered picture and sound, with a Spanish (and perhaps French) language soundtrack, so that it can be enjoyed in the language in which this epic was written?  There is already a German-language Region 2 version of this digitally remastered version available in Europe, so it seems perverse that a version with Spanish, French, and possibly even a Portuguese language soundtrack is not yet available as an option to go with this marvelously clear and beautiful version.  In any case, despite what it says above, this version does NOT have a Spanish language soundtrack, and the Spanish subtitles that are available on it are inferior to those in the otherwise poorly recorded 2004 Divisa Home Video version available in Region 2.  So, for those who want to see the film in English (and have El Cid sound as if he lives in California, and Dona Jimena sound as if she lives in Naples, whereas both are supposedly from the same small area of Spain), this version is just fine--sound and picture are magnificent.  For those who would prefer to hear the wonderful Castilian soundtrack available on the Divisa version, there are no good options, as the picture quality on that version is terrible, and the Spanish language soundtrack on the digitally remastered version is nonexistent.",1259712000,2,2493,5.078239608801956

2986610,4,B000WMFZMY,"If you love historical epics, this one is a must-see. All my life I've wondered what a Spanish knight would be like. And for a while now I've wondered if anyone actually had the kind of chivalry that knights were supposed to be famous for in legends. Now I finally know.

At the start of the film the bloodthirsty Moores are preparing for a Jihad across Spain to wipe out the Christian Kings. One knight after fighting a battle against some of his Muslim adversaries decides to spare their lives if they will swear loyalty to his king. They do. As a result, he starts to build a reputation. The peace-seeking Muslims see his honor, loyalty, and valor, and start to refer to him as ""The Sid"", a brave warrior who works for peace. His king on the other hand is infuriated that he has spared his enemies. This chain of events sets in motion the rest of the film, wherein his wife-to-be becomes his enemy (after he is forced to duel her father who will not take back his accusations of treason from the man), his fights for and is eventually rejected by the kings of his country, and eventually leads a massive army of people loyal to him against the Warlord who could destroy all else at the cost of his own life.

If anybody could play this part perfectly, its Charlton Heston, and he does. His true love, on the other hand, is less convincing. Sure, Sophia Loren has the looks, but I'm afraid she looks far more convincing in the scenes where she hates him than the ones where she loves him (lots of that towards the end of the film). Everyone else in the film is splendid, but it's the cinematography and grandness of the film that's the real star (like Hen Hur or the 10 Commandments). The castles, fields, besieged cities, and royal courts convey a story of magesty and splendor and good old chivalry in a way that just can't be done anyone (no one can afford that many extras).

The one-on-one fight of champions to decide the fate of a city is my favorite part of the movie, because not only is it full of energy and power and drama (and excitement), but I've never seen anything like it on film. It's the stuff that teenagers dream of. Fighting for your leige lord so that armies won't have to, jousting, than fighting fiercely with broadswords. Awesome.

The restoration of the film is nothing short of magical, with the widescreen and glorious color making it a shining example of the beauty of old Hollywood. There's also a fantastic musical score by the legendary Miklos Rozsa. The movie is worth seeing just for the cinematography and the music alone, but the great story and rock-solid acting by the ruggedly-good-looking Heston make it a must-see for every lover of historical epics in the grand tradition.",1237161600,,2718,4.540816326530612
2986611,5,B000WMFZMY,"Charleton Heston had taken on some historical character parts, but El Cid,  Don Diego de Vivar, was a different type.  In the area of Spain which was correct for the times (1070-1088) there was not enough data to support why The Cid did what he did. I guess one must make the time to put 20 years of history in 3 to 4 hours, or is under the gun to create a credible movie.  The movie is excellent as to the time in history, its content and the roles.  I would reccommend the movie for its magnificent special effects ( for the time 1961), and its cast.  Listen to and watch the reactions to the Arab Moors, as well as the Christian knights and kings, really researched and played out well.  Heston at his best, and Sophia Loren as beautiful as ever as the wife.  I give the movie 5 stars.",1235260800,,788,4.178807947019868

2986634,4,B000WMFZMY,"El Cid was beautifully filmed and many scenes are visually stunning. The battle scenes and the siege of Valencia in the second half of the movie are truly extraordinary with vivid scenery and beautiful costuming. Each frame is carefully crafted as in a painting and it is the craft that makes El Cid well worth watching.

The down side is the often wooden acting , more like posing in many scenes , of Sophia Loren and Charlton Heston. Loren looks stunning in every scene she is in and her beautiful face is framed in every conceivable form of headgear they could find. I almost found myself counting the number of different hats and hoods she wears from scene to scene and can't help but think that it was intentional to draw attention away from her inability to deliver a single convincing line. Heston huffs and puffs his way through the film and is introduced in many scenes with trumpet flares and pomp that serve the same purpose as Sophia's many hats.

While that sounds like a recipe for failure, the film delivers a spectacle that is really memorable and so it is worth it to sit through some of the more painfully slow scenes of Heston and Loren exchanging meaningful glances to get to the good stuff.

I give this 3.5 stars as a fine costume drama and a widescreen spectacle. You could do worse than to watch this with the sound muted.",1233014400,,1346,4.530864197530864

2986637,5,B000WMFZMY,"The great director Anthony Mann after having made many Westerns with James Stewart entered into the arena of classic spectacles with this riveting adventure.  Heston & Loren are perfectly matched though during screening they developed an intense dislike to each other to the degree that when Mann cast his next film, ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" with Loren--she requested that Heston not be her co-star (it went to the wooden Stephen Boyd instead).  Nevertheless, they are marvelous together and if you happen to attend a revival showing of this film in Ultra Panavision--do see it.  I was fortunate enough to see this film in that wide format (2.75) several years ago in Berkeley but the Miriam edition is an excellent remastering. Compared to the over-rated, ponderous ""Ben Hur"", ""El Cid"" showcases Heston at his best particularly in the final scenes as the fallen hero riding to his eventual fate as mythic hero.  Exciting swordfights, splendant Spanish landscapes, the beauty of Loren and Anthony Mann's superb direction make this an all time winner which can be appreciated on a large screen (50' and above) flat panel HDTV.

I remember seeing this movie as a young teenager at least 10 times at the famous Wilten theater in Los Angeles on Saturday mornings and was delighted to find that it stands up to the test of time.  It is not a classic movie but for its time it provided great enterainment.  I will not go into the basic plot of the movie which is based on the Spanish legend of the Cid but I can say that it accommodated my memory of my childhood Saturday morning fun.  Great music, color, and action. With Ms Loren as the love interest and at the top of her beauty,how could a young teenage male not enjoy this film. The backgound DVD on the producer and story line explains in part why it took so long for this movie to be released on DVD. International events aside, this movie will provide ideal enterainment for the film buff.  I found this film better than the ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" also producted by the same film studio. Charlton Heston was at the top of his acting career at the time of the filming of El Cid and I will miss his style now that he has passed away.",1210636800,2,1227,4.182203389830509
2986667,5,B000WMFZMY,"EL CID takes its place among the great screen epics that never allow the eye-popping spectacle to dwarf the human characters--just as ""Ben-Hur"" was able to do. And who else to play the legendary and noble Spanish hero than CHARLTON HESTON. He's magnificent here, playing his central role with an almost Shakespearean grandeur, as do some of the other cast members, including HERBERT LOM, JOHN FRASER and GARY RAYMOND.

So is the epic sweep of the tale and the intimate love story that begins when he is on his way to wed SOPHIA LOREN and finds himself asked to assume the mantle of leadership against the Moors in 11th century Spain. He makes the journey from peace-broker accused of treason to the King's fighting champion and later from exiled hero to legendary martyr.

Aside from the brilliant cinematography, authentic looking locales and colorful costumes, Miklos Rozsa's score adds a great deal to the intensely dramatic intimate scenes as well as the epic battles, all the while suggesting some Spanish motifs amidst the heraldic fanfares and love theme.

CHARLTON HESTON makes an impressive figure of El Cid, especially good in the final moments as the wounded leader who knows what he must ask his wife to do so that his followers do not lose heart after his death. RAF VALLONE as Count Ordonez, GENEVIEVE PAGE as Princess Urraca, JOHN FRASER as Prince Alfonso and GARY RAYMOND as Prince Sancho are all remarkable effective in strong supporting roles. In lesser roles, HURD HATFIELD and FRANK THRING bring their own brand of authority to minor parts.

Anthony Mann and his assistant directors have done an outstanding job on all of the battle scenes and he never falters in telling the tale in strong dramatic terms. There's an intensity in the scenes between Loren and Heston after he has been forced to kill her father for humiliating his own father in front of the court. Whatever friction there was between Heston and Loren on the set, works for them here because her animosity toward him is a chilling thing to watch.

The DVD has been wonderfully mastered and all of the Miklos Rozsa score sounds better than ever with Overture, Intermission and Exit music reminding us all what a treasure he was as a film composer.",1210118400,3,2232,4.832460732984293
2986668,4,B000WMFZMY,"In the wake of Charlton Heston's death, I decided to have a marathon viewing of his films. I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen.

""El Cid"" was one I had not watched before, probably because it only recently became available on DVD. As he often did, Heston plays a real-life character, an 11th-century Spanish hero who sought to unite his country. It is one of those epic historical films Heston specialized in, and it does a good job of conveying that time and place. Although set 1,000 years ago, the themes of the story still resonate today.

One of the things I like about these films is that they were made pre-CGI, so they were generally shot on location and much of the spectacle was actually staged for the cameras (No computer-generated armies here).

The Cid was a complex character and, unlike some of his other roles, Heston plays him in an understated way. The Cid was valiant and loyal, a selfless warrior loved by the people. He preached tolerance and tried to show that all Muslims were not evil. But he was humble and deferential to a fault, putting his sense of duty to country and king before everything, even his family.

There are some grand action scenes: a spectacular jousting duel and several large scale battles. The musical score is sweeping and beautiful. Yes, there is some melodramatic acting in places, but overall the performances are good.

The central love story did not work for me, however. The Cid's relationship with Chemene, played by Sophia Loren, is up and down throughout the film: first she loves him, then she hates him, then she loves him. They do not spend enough time together to make a convincing case that this was a great love affair.

If you like behind-the-scenes features, there are several interesting documentaries on the second disc: one deals with the making of the film, then there are bios of the producer, the director, the composer, and an odd little piece on some guy who works in film preservation.

All in all I would recommend ""El Cid"" to anyone who likes Charlton Heston and big historical films. As they say, they don't make `em like this anymore.",1209686400,4,2155,4.670184696569921
2986669,4,B000WMFZMY,"El Cid is a great depiction of Medieval Spain! There is enough violence to satisfy most prurient interests. In addition, the beauty of Sofia Loren, the pageantry and chivalry of the royal court, and the intrigue of familial politics make for a dynamic presentation of the life and times of Spain's greatest hero.
The plot follows the storyline of the ""Song of the Champion El Cid"" as it has come down through the centuries. There are a few factual discrepancies but they do not severely hinder the appreciation of the art of this epic.",1208476800,,535,4.702127659574468

2986671,5,B000WMFZMY,"I love these big epics from the 30s-60s, and Samuel Bronston was almost as good at churning them out as the master, Cecil B. (besides El Cid, he notably did such classics as Fall of the Roman Empire, 55 Days at Peking and King of Kings), and El Cid is one of his best.

It has awesome production values (a great climactic battle scene and the best one-on-one joust ever filmed, bar none) and a very entertaining story. The acting is first rate, not only from the stars (I think Heston gives one of his best, most restrained (if that is the right word) performances and Sophia Loren never, ever looked more beautiful) but also from the supporting actors, Raf Vallone and Gary Raymond, in particular.
All in all, a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours.

One other thing.  An aspect of films often overlooked is very much in the fore here, the background musical score.  It is an aspect of films, especially epic specataculars, that is absolutely essential to the complete experience and this one is scored by one of the great masters of the genre, Miklos Rozsa (Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Julius Caesar and so on ad infinitum), at the absolute top of his form.  I hope someday that someone does a release of the FULL score on CD and gives it full justice, something long overdue.

I'm not one of those folks who necessarily thinks that older is better, but I do think Hollywood either has forgotten how to (or more likely can't afford to) make these spectacular costume epics like they once did.  Epics today are made for the MTV generation, which may not be bad, but it's certainly different and not as much to my taste.

Test it yourself. Watch this movie and say Spartacus or Ben-Hur and then watch Gladiator and say any one of the Superman movies. You might be surprised by which one has more satisfying acting, writing, plot-lines, set pieces and music (although I must admit Williams' score to Superman I is one of the half-dozen best ever composed).

At any rate, thanks for this one Sam.  You'll find it money well spent.  Bring on Fall of the Roman Empire and 55 Days, please!!!",1207699200,,2088,4.55614973262032

Vigorously brave and compassionate, the noble Rodrigo hates bloodshed and vows to see his country at peace, frees the prisoners on their solemn pledge never again to attack Castile...

For this act of courage and mercy, one of the Emirs, Moutamin, calls Rodrigo ""El Cid,"" and pledges eternal friendship to the Cid of Vivar... And so, in freeing the Moors, Rodrigo, accidentally, stumbled onto a battle, not to his luscious bride, but to a battle that will change his whole life...

In the court of King Ferdinand, Rodrigo's act of clemency is misinterpreted, and he's accused of treason by his rival Don Ordonez for refusing to turn over to him the captures Moors...

Unfortunately, Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, is slapped by the Champion of the king, Count Gormaz, father of his beloved Chimene... Rodrigo begs Gormaz an apology; it is refused... A duel begins and the champion is badly wounded... Before he dies, however, he asks Chimene to avenge his death...

Chimene's wish is fulfilled when King Ramiro of Aragon challenges King Ferdinand for the possession of the city of Calahorra by the outcome of a single combat...El Cid convinces the king to permit him to fight Don Martin...Thus, according to the custom of trial by combat, God would judge Rodrigo's guilt or innocence...

""El Cid"" is an intense film, lavish and spectacular, bigger than any in terms of cast and impressive as any in visual terms... Mikls Rzsa gave a new dimension to the emotion that Anthony Mann was trying to express...

Mann gives us a human story with a love story balanced with the most strongly image of a hero the world has ever seen... He presented a man of honor who thinks always of his wife, his country, and his king first... Even in death, his thoughts are for others and not himself...

El Cid insults kings and noblemen in the name of justice and integrity and does what he knows to be right... He battles the king's living sword in respect of his father... He accepts the challenge of a champion of a king to prove himself innocent of treason and other things... He shows a prince how any man can kill and only a king can give life... He fights 13 knights, at the same time, to free a prisoner... Yet he is in addition to all of this an extremely principled leader... He accepts exile for life from the country he loves, and yet he is the only man in Spain who 'could humble a king and would give a leper to drink from his own pouch...'

The joust sequence called ""The fight for Calahorra,"" is perhaps the most rousing, exciting, one-to-one combat ever filmed... The battle scenes at Valencia are taken on an epic scale... But the value of Anthony Mann's movie is the characterization in which Charlton Heston played El Cid's life... For this reason alone, the film is of greater value than most any other motion picture experience...",1207353600,2,2967,4.712355212355212

The factual elements may be glossed over - what historic movie doesn't? But, to paraphrase William Randolph Hearst: ""...publish the legend,"" especially when it serves as good entertainment.

*Good photography.  Excellent sets and exterior shots.  Great epic views of the armies, battles, and fights.
*There are a few good fights and a few good battle scenes.
*Some of the characters are interesting.
*Pretty good story with lots of thrilling or suspenseful scenes.
*Good costume and set design.

The Bad Things
*Very long.  Lots of drama and dialogue.
*This is not Charlton Heston's best performance.
*Some parts that make you ask ""why?"" Why didn't Rodrigo pull the arrow out of his chest? Why did everybody have such a grudge against him? Ugh.

Despite being long, drawn-out, and bewildering at times, this is a pretty good epic.  It definately has a lot of big scenes with massive armies and intense duels.  Much of the story's conflicts focuses on all the different grudges everybody seems to have against the main character.  It's almost contrived; how could the King, his champion, all of the princes, and the princess be so dumb and hate this guy for such a long time? Still, it makes for some interesting drama that might keep the audience awake throughout.

2986721,5,B000WMFZMY,"While the events in this movie are based on actual events, the movie does not pretend to be historically accurate in all things.  The movie is as much about the legend of El Cid as it is about the real El Cid.

This is one of the epic movies that Hollywood is famous for making many years ago.  It is long, but it is still 40 minutes shorter than Ben Hur.  Because of its length, the movie itself is on two DVDs.  The last chapter on the first DVD is actually the intermission.  I fast-forwarded through the intermission to get back to the movie only to find out that I had to put the other DVD in.  It would have been good to either delete the intermission or to give some warning that there is no movie after the intermission.

The casting in this movie is great.  Sophia Loren is a pefect contrast to Charlton Heston.  She brings a lot of passion to her role which is what was needed of her.  Charlton Heston does a great job in a role that he was born to do.

The only actor that threw me was Herbert Lom as the leader of the invading Muslim army.  He only has about 5 minutes in the movie, but I had trouble seeing him as a dangerous fundamentalist.  All I could think of when I saw him was his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus in the Pink Panther Movies.  I realize that El Cid came out before these movies, but the association is very strong in my mind.

The visual quality of the movies is great in this new format.  I saw this years ago on VHS and the inprovement is amazing.  The audio is less than perfect.  The music is louder than the dialog in a lot of parts.

El Cid went into production in Spain on the heels of King of Kings and  a number of the cast and crew came fresh from their performances in the latter. It is ironic that Bronston had the distinction have having these two films in their roadshow engagements simultaneously. I remember seeing both on Broadway the theatres were across the street from each other , El Cid at the Warner and King of Kings at the Loews State.

  While King of Kings has been on DVD for about 5years it's a pleasure finally to have the long awaited El Cid. The film itself focuses in on the struggles of a nation and the struggles of individuals all of which
are resolved by the end of the film. I don't know why Bronston chose Philip Yordan to script the screenplay. I felt at times it was a little tedious. Supported by a triumphant score by Miklos Rozsa ( King of Kings ,Ben Hur ) and great acting and cinematogrsphy it was a great
spectacle .I highly recommend it.",1203465600,2,1016,4.35978835978836

This is one of the few post war costume epics that doesn't come across as silly.  Both the subject and the film are the stuff of myth.

The sets and scenery are astonishing.  Sam Bronston's production company spared no expense scouting locations to recreate castles in Spain.  Entire industries sprang up whole to create the costumes, saddles, weaponry, armor and other items required for the movie.  The sword making industry in Toledo was reinvigorated when the word went out the company didn't want any cheap flimsy props for their epic picture.  The Spanish army, and their horses, were hired to portray the thousands of soldiers required in the battle sequences. Something like this will probably never be duplicated again in the real world, and CGI can't reproduce what you see on the screen in ""El Cid.""

Charlton Heston, with a towering physical presence and Shakespearean training, was Hollywood's go-to-guy for epic heroes (as Ben Hur in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur-Four-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0009UZG1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, or as Moses in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments-50th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B000CNESNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)</a>).  He does not disappoint as ""El Cid.""  Heston does an outstanding job bringing to life ""one who lived and died the purest knight of all.""  El Cid is a man who, with the admiration and respect of both Christians and Moors, defeats an invasion force and units Spain under one king.  Sophia Loren, at the height of her beauty, makes an incomparable wife to the legendary hero. The supporting cast are also excellent.

The restored version of this movie looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous.  This is worth seeing on the largest screen with the best surround sound you can manage.  ""El Cid"" is one of the last movies with a full length score and, although it has been chopped up a bit to allow for a few minutes of sound affects (war drums, clanging swords, etc.) it is a reminder about how much music can lend to a film. For example, one character's death occurs off screen in shadow; we know he is dead because the music informs us.

This two disc package breaks up the film during the intermission section.  Disc 1 contains the first half of the film and special features, including a commentary track.  Disc 2 contains the second half of the film and additional special features including the second half of the commentary, the making of, and informative shorts about the cinematography, the music of Miklos Rozsa, restoration, and more.

2986775,4,B000WMFZMY,"From the opening overture, it's evident that El Cid is going to be epic. And it positively doesn't disappoint. With distinguished knights-in-shining-armor, swordfights, illustrious battles, damsels in distress, evil kings, calculating queens, and soaring music, El Cid encompasses everything you'd come to expect from a rousing historical adventure epic.

In 1080 A.D. Rodrigo Diaz (Charlton Heston) lives by an honor that outweighs convenient principles, and on his way to Spain he decides to set free a group of five enemy Moors. The invading Moors are forever indebted to his mercy and justice (and he is dubbed ""El Cid""), but the King's champion, Count Gormaz, declares Rodrigo a traitor. When Rodrigo's father stands up for him in court, his name is shamed, and to regain his honor Rodrigo is forced to kill the Count. Gormaz, however, is the father of Rodrigo's true love Chimene (Sophia Loren), who now makes it her duty to see the Cid die. Distraught at the loss of his love, he asks King Ferdinand to allow him to fight the neighboring king for the fate of the city of Calahorra. After besting the knight Don Martin, El Cid is granted the hand of Chimene in marriage, but her hatred causes her to leave him for a convent.

When Ferdinand dies, he leaves his kingdom to his three children, who all greedily scheme to rule the whole of Spain. Sancho (Gary Raymond) attempts to imprison Alfonso (John Fraser), who is later freed by El Cid, and Princess Urraca (Genevieve Page) eventually becomes a puppet-master, distempering the court and orchestrating the assassination of Sancho so that Alfonso can claim the throne for himself. El Cid finds himself banned from the realm when he attempts to uproot the assassination plot, and only after he has lost everything, Chimene realizes that her life is not complete without him, and she asks to accompany him in his journey away from Spain.

The African warlord Ben Yussuf (Herbert Lom) takes advantage of the feuding leaders of Spain, and begins his conquest of the land, first by attacking Valencia. Recruited once again by a huge army of faithful followers, El Cid must use all of his legendary bravery, courage, war tactics and strategy to defeat the mighty Yussuf, all without the aid of King Alfonso, who condemns Cid for his use of unified Moorish kings who all find a common enemy in Yussuf.

Rodrigo is driven by a sense of honor that is perhaps indefinable when it crosses paths with happiness. Like Sir Thomas More in ""A Man For All Seasons"" Cid is compelled to act according to righteousness and duty, even when those he assists plainly condemn his reasoning. His honor causes him to cross the wrong people, often repeatedly, but luck, God, or a combination of both see that he serves as a deity to his own advocates. More unbelievable and yet cinematically beautiful is his relationship with Chimene, who from a sense of duty herself decides she must pursue his death, even though she is torn with undying love for him. But most fascinating of all is her eventual change of heart and their reuniting only after El Cid is banished from Spain with a simple act of prideful virtue. All that he originally worked for to free his name of calumny has vanished, but with Chimene by his side, he is left with the only thing that matters.

There are no longueurs present in El Cid - it starts right into the action from the opening scene, and despite its three-hour running time, keeps up interest and suspense with sweeping romance, nail-biting jousting, whirling flails, zinging arrows, treacherous assassins, clanging swords, sieges, and large scale infantry skirmishes. While it is not a flawless film, El Cid captures the grandiose feel of other historical giants like Ben-Hur and Spartacus, and is a film that has long awaited an elaborate home video release, presented for the first time on DVD January 29th, 2008 in the first of hopefully many Miriam Collection volumes.

2986779,5,B000WMFZMY,"In a time when large scale epics were commonplace, ""El Cid"" stands out from the rest of the pack.  Maybe because it was made apart from the major studios that it lacks the sheen but is no less polished.  Also, director Anthony Mann, who cut his teeth on psychological Westerns, pays as much attention to characterization but doesn't skimp on the spectacle.  Credit too has to go to Charlton Heston who is old hat at carrying these large scale epics.  Heston's Cid, after Ben-Hur, has to be my favorite performance by him.  Heston never gets credit for his formidable acting skills, probably dismissed because of his right-wing politics.  Note:  Will somebody please re-issue ""The Warlord"" on DVD.  Sophia Loren as the film's romantic interest is equally glamorous and shows herself to be an adept actress.  Throw in a classic Miklos Rosza score and you have a film that is indispensible.  Marty Scorsese is right in proclaiming ""El Cid"" as one of filmdoms great epics.  Bring on ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""(coming in April).",1202342400,3,1027,4.844827586206897

And now some 40 years later I find myself falling asleep on the couch trying to get through the wooden acting of Charlton Heston, the lamentable miscasting of Sophia Loren and the dreadful overacting of a mediocre supporting cast, all failing to bring life to the preachy, melodramatic script.

The greatest epic ever filmed? I don't think so. That label belongs to the one and only ""Lawrence of Arabia."" It's war scenes are better; it's cast impeccable; and it's script literate and human. Even David Lean's misfire ""Ryan's Daughter"" is a much satisfyling film than ""El Cid.""

I haven't been impressed by Scorcese's films in the past decade and think he has constantly miscast Leonardo di Caprio. ""The Departed"" was a rip-off of the last dozen films of Clint Eastwood.

Marty, go back to making films and stop concentrating on being the high guru of film history. If you were impressed by ""El Cid"" when you were a boy, you must have been terribly deprived.

2986814,5,B000WMFZMY,"Producer Samuel Bronston's masterpiece, the 1961 epic, ""El Cid"", is at last on digitally-remastered DVD, in a two-disc edition that positively glows! The finest (and most expensive) 'Chivalry' film ever made, the film combines intimacy and monumental battle scenes (without CGI!), drenched in an opulence that will never be equaled.

One of the great pleasures of this long-awaited release is the second disc's Special Features, which provides the astonishing back story of the film, as well as features on Bronston, director Anthony Mann, film composer Miklos Rozsa, and ""El Cid's"" incredible restoration process. This was a film that defied the 'Hollywood system' in every way; Bronston, a freewheeling, frequently in-debt entrepreneur, stonewalled in Hollywood, literally turned Madrid into a film capital, spending every penny he could raise, every favor he could ask, in producing the film with all the richness it deserved. With a 'terrible' screenplay (by Philip Yordan), that an uncredited Ben Barzman would have to rewrite from scratch, as filming began, a respected director (Mann), who had just been publicly humiliated by being fired as director of ""Spartacus"" (replaced by Stanley Kubrick), and two of the hottest actors in the world (Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren), who despised each other (Heston, with a history of on-set temperament, particularly toward female co-stars, discovered Loren was being paid more than he was!), this production seemed doomed from the outset.

But Bronston was a man of limitless vision and energy, and could accomplish miracles! He got the DuPont family to financially back the production, convinced Spanish dictator General Franco to loan him nearly the entire Spanish army for battle scenes (second directed by the legendary Yakima Canutt), recruited entire villages to serve as extras, and backed Mann's vision, creating one of the most beautifully composed films in the history of the cinema.

Much to everyone's (except Bronston and Mann's) surprise, ""El Cid"" was a worldwide critical and commercial hit, and one of 1961's biggest blockbuster successes, influencing a generation of young filmmakers, and becoming a capstone to the careers of many of the participants.

While it is a crime that the film has been largely unseen for over forty years, this 2-Disc Deluxe Edition should again bring ""El Cid"" the respect it richly deserves.

2986818,5,B000WMFZMY,"Like Mann's other well-known feature, ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" El Cid has a lot going for it: breathtaking Spanish scenery and fabulously authentic set pieces, two very competent and attractive leads with Heston and Loren, and an interesting protagonist whose story is steeped more in myth than reality.

Although this DVD has not yet been released, this film, like ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" is worthy of a ""special edition"" replete with interviews, extras, a behind-the-scenes documentary, deleted scenes, and the like--should they even exist. The film was released almost 45 years ago.

While not as opulent as ""Fall"" that would be released three years later, the love story between Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (El Cid) and Chimene, his wife is a more interesting one--as interesting as the story of the Cid himself.

These are characters one feels emotionally attached to unlike those of Livius and Drusilla in Mann's 'Fall,"" which resembles yet an additional prop to the sets to Mann's $16 million dollar epic, but Mann got off relatively cheap with ""El Cid,"" utilizing many of the existing medieval castles that dot the coastlines of sunny Spain.

Chimene loves Rodrigo who is to be her husband, than hates him for killing her father who insults Rodrigo's father and his family name. She marries Rodrigo out of spite at the request of King Ferdinand, and Chimene colludes to kill Rodrigo with a fellow conspirator who also loves her. Later, she ultimately learns to love this selfless knight who shows mercy to his enemies, earns their respect, and defends a brat of a king who is nothing more than a spoiled tyrant--wonderfully played by popular 60's British mod, John Fraser who would later win a coveted supporting role in Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion.""

The movie gets 5 stars despite the fact that battle scenes seem rather brief and could have been better orchestrated on a slightly more lavish scale. Mann's ""Fall"" clearly has an edge here; what we see in ""El Cid"" for the majority of the film are really skirmishes of no more than 15 to 20 men at a time. The Miklos Rosza score, obviously influenced by the achingly beautiful coda in Tchaikovsky's Symphony 4, and like all of his splendid soundtracks, will compel an exhaustive search for the compact disc at your local retailer. Clearly, this is music to be savored like a fine Castillian wine.

This was a role Heston was born to play: physical, larger than life, and majestic in scope. In a death-scene that is perhaps one of the longest, most touchingly portrayed, and perhaps Heston's finest in an epic like this, will move you as will the story of this heroic 11th Century knight who attempted to unite his divided Spain.",1200441600,,2688,4.8708971553610505

It prompted me to visit the base library to see what I could find on the Cid.  I remember being very disappointed when I found out he wasn't exactly what Hollywood portrayed in the movie.  It didn't matter....the movie is a gem and I saw it again and again.

Anthony Mann hit a homerun when he put Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren together on the screen.  The magic is obvious from the first scenes of them together.  A gripping screenplay, great locations, terrific photography, and an excellent score by Miklos Rozsa make this movie a benchmark for film making of another era.  This, as another reviewer mentions, is the last great movie of Heston's to be released.  Shame, shame for it taking so long.

Are we too sensitive today for the contents of this film?  Too politically correct?  I hope not.  The peaceful coexistence of Islam and Christianity, a topic touched on in the film, certainly is a topic of importance today.  But that shouldn't be the main idea behind viewing this film.

3220398,5,B000WMFZMY,"The first of Anthony Mann and Samuel Bronston's ambitious and intelligent epics, El Cid has to boast the most gorgeous use of the widescreen ever - the Cid and Chimene's first meeting makes the most of every inch of the screen, while Robert Krasker's gliding camera is remarkably sympathetic to screen format, architecture and exteriors alike. Indeed, the whole film displays Mann's typically intelligent use of location, here in interiors (often his weak spot) as well - during their bleak wedding feast, he keeps Chimene and the Cid at a distance, the staircase where he killed her father (never a great start to any marriage) prominent between them; and while the good king's court is filled with colour, light and people, once the weak Alfonso assumes power it is a dark, empty hall. Despite some occasional over emphatic Christian imagery - when he's not standing in front of a cross, he's literally carrying one - this spectacular account of Spain's greatest hero uniting Christians and Moors alike against a common enemy, making friends of enemies and teaching his weak king the path to greatness by example manages to put a surprisingly human face on the myth of the perfect knight: the Cid's quest to do the honourable and right thing brings him little joy and much sorrow and even his resolve is nearly broken by his burden.

Charlton Heston when he was still an icon instead of a political target is one of the few actors who could carry off such a part, and he does it very well despite his curious conviction that Mann's superb direction was below par. The pomp and splendour never swamps the drama, and the setpiece duel for Calahora still stands out as one of the most remarkable and remarkably vicious screen swordfights of all time. A great score from Miklos Rozsa and good support from John Fraser and Douglas Wilmer too, although Andrew Cruickshank's portly King's champion implies that there was something seriously amiss in the kingdom long before the warring infantas succeeded to the throne!",1198886400,11,2014,4.888888888888889

Director Anthony Mann assembled an impressive cast, gorgeous locations, and awesome battle scenes to tell the tale, but he and his colleagues did not forget the most important elements--a strong script and a touching, believable love story. Charlton Heston has never been more impressive than he is here, and Sophia Loren's Chimene is one of her finest roles. The two stars are perfect together, with able support from an A-list international cast. Add to this the stunning cinematography and Miklos Rozsa's majestic musical score, and you have a grand-scale, sweeping saga of love, valor and chivalry. EL CID is a feast for the eye and ear.

3220400,5,B000WMFZMY,"It has been a very long wait indeed for a proper, high resolution 2 disc anamorphic DVD of this epic medieval tale of passion and chivalry.  The final results are breathtaking.  The transfer is stunning and the sound is rich and full.  This is rousing entertainment on the grandest scale.

It's hard to understand why this film took so long to arrive on DVD.  Perhaps, as some have suggested, the subject matter has been an issue in our over-sensitive, shrinking world of religious violence.  Or our discomfort with nebulous concepts of love, forgiveness and peace.  But most likely a matter of rights and licensing issues.

The relevance of this extraordinary film remains current and is a monumental artistic achievements of world cinema.  On a personal level, this terrific film provoked me into thinking about how belief systems -- especially about the nature of God (or Allah) -- benefit or harm our world.

The essence of the conflict between warring Castilians and Moors and an invading Muslim threat is unflinching in the opening scene as the North African holy warrior  Ben Yussuf quotes ""the Prophet"" as promising to conquer the world in the name of Allah.

But the real conflict is the idea that there can be peace -- and perhaps even love -- between those who hate.  This is exemplified in the troubled and intimate story of Rodrigo (Charlton Heston) and Ximena (Sophia Loren).  It begins simply enough with a knight on his way to meet his bride when destiny forces a detour.

El Cid, the legendary hero of Spain was a real person named Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar.  He lived around 1035 A.D.  Although he spent much of his time fighting on the side of the Moors, he became identified as the best incarnation of the true Castilian Christian spirit.  His name came from the Arabic ""sayyid"" meaning ""lord"" or ""chief.""

Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren are perfectly cast as larger than life figures of flesh and blood.  Their reported confllcts on-set probably added a degree of on-screen realism.  They are wonderful together.  Too bad Heston and Loren were not able to do a full, shared commentary at the time of the transfer.

Anthony Mann's direction is robust and true to the theme.  The movie has a fine sense of composition that the terrific on-location cinematography only enhances.  Numerous action-filled vistas fill the screen, richly detailed and beautifully photographed.  No CGI elements can rival the texture of a real place captured on celluloid.

The incredible flow of stunning images and the magnificent Miklos Rozsa score are a reminder of what movies can do when they tackle a worthy tale and go all the way.

EL CID is about a real hero who selflessly followed his moral compass.  It's also  a reasonably true adapataion of the essence of the numerous medieval tales, plays and poems -- unlike the mangling of both poem and hero ""Beowulf"" in the recent movie of the same name.

Amazing that this magnificent paradox of a tale -- after all, El Cid was a warrior and peacemaker -- continues to be told for a thousand years.

The extras on the second disc include interesting featurettes on producer Sam Bronston, director Anthony Mann and composer Miklos Rozsa as well as vintage radio interviews with Heston and Loren and a ""making of"" documentary.

The last scenes are a fitting epitaph for Charlton Heston the man and the actor.  His passing is truly the end of an era.

This great movie deserves a place in any digital library.  Don't miss it.

3220704,5,B000WMFZMY,"Authentic. This movie by Bronston studios is a tour de force of Spanish history. It gives any epic movie a run for its money, and probably ranks in the top five of all time. The story of el cid is not well known today. However history is not taught in schools; let that be. This movie is a great introduction to the hero of Spain. If set designs and costumes are your fetish, el cid has it in spades. All of the sets and locations were meticulously researched and hand made. The extras were Spanish military commissioned by Franco. All of this can be derived from the DVD extras which are as good as the movie itself.  The story of bronston studios is worth the price of admission alone.

I have to say that after the second viewing of this film, there are a couple updates. First of all, this is movie is a tremendous feat of acting and artistry. The supporting cast is world class (as in shakespearean level). Heston is great and fits the role like a glove, and this maybe his best ever performance. Loren is fiery as well. However, if you pay attention to the other actors, then you will see just how much time was spent on talent acquisition. You will learn that many of the sets were authentic re-creations which is kind of mind-blowing, considering the detail and color. The actual shots of castles and Spanish landscapes are phenomenal and sumptuous. This movie is particularly spectacular because of the technicolor. The costumes and set designs are so elaborate and bright, that they demand a fine art type of film treatment. Moreover, this movie actually does a good job of representing the church and its dominant presence in Spain. This is a must watch movie for anyone. My only qualm is that it must be viewed on the big screen for full effect.",1419897600,,1757,4.522012578616352

3220772,4,B000WMFZMY,"""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend""

From, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (available from Amazon)

""El Cid"" is one of the most literate and intelligent of the 70 mm epics made from the mid 1950's (""Around The World in 80 Days"") to the late 1960's (2001: A Space Odyssey). But it is only part history, and a lot of legend.

First, about Technirama. Technirama was one of those wide screen, big image cinematography systems developed in the wake of CinemaScope and Three-film Cinerama. This included Todd-AO, VistaVision, Super Panavision 70, Ultra-Panavison 70 and Ultra-Panavision 70-based Single Film Cinerama. Technirama was very similar to VistaVision, as that the camera original passed through the camera gate horizontally, rather than vertically. This resulted in a ""double-wide"" frame, that is a 35 mm frame that was twice as wide as regular 35 mm frame, exposed vertically, creating a camera negative that was almost the same width as a 70 mm frame, and thereby excellent for making 70 mm release prints, via intermediate elements. When a film shot in Technirama 35 was released in 70 mm, the system was titled Super Technirama 70.

Frederick M. Frank wrote the first screenplay for ""El Cid"", but it was considered to be not very good. So Philip Yordan, who was sort of a ""supervising screenwriter"" for Samuel Bronston, hired Ben Barzman, an American blacklisted screenwriter living in Europe at the time (Jordan's relationship with Samuel Bronston, and the screenwriters he hired, was somewhat...well...""complex""). Seeking a new approach to the material, Barzman consulted Spain's leading historian and scholar on Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, and his role in the The Spanish Reconquista. He suggested that Barzman read Pierre Corneille's 17th century French play, ""Le Cid"" (which I'm sure is available, in paperback, from Amazon). Barzman subsequently used ""Le CId"" for the basis of his screenplay. A screenplay that reflected Rodrigo's status a Spain's national hero of the Reconquista. But life is always more complex than the movies, which, by necessity, compress and simplify.

Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar was born circa 1040-1045. He served in the army of Prince Sancho, fighting Moors and other Christian nobility over territory...turf wars. King Ferdinand I is referred to in the film as the king of...Len, Castile and Asturias. However, at the beginning of the 10th century, Asturias was divided into two kingdoms, Len and Galicia. When Ferdinand died, he was succeeded by his older son, Sancho II, who was eventually succeeded by his brother, Alfonso VI, who, in 1077, declared himself the Emperor of all Spain, half of which, al-Andalus, was still ruled by the Moors. Rodrigo served Alfonso until they had a falling out in 1081, and Alfonso sent Rodrigo into exile. Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar then became a warlord and mercenary in eastern Spain, fighting for both Christians and Moors. Alfonso's army was defeated at Sarajas, on October 23, 1086, and, as the film depicts, Alfonso was wounded and barely escaped the battlefield with his life. His enemy were the Almoravids, radical Muslims out to ""purify"" al-Andalus, under the leadership of Yusuf ibn Tashufin, Ben Yusuf in the movie. (What is past is present). But, unlike the timeline of the film, the Battle of Sarajas was not fought just prior to Rodrigo's siege and conquest of Valencia.

Rodrigo laid siege to Valencia in 1093, a siege that lasted over a year. However, unlike the film, he most certainly did not use his catapults to fling loaves of bread into the city. He starved Valencia into surrender (in 1094), to the point that there were rumors of cannibalism in the city. An Almoravid army counterattacked, but Rodrigo defeated the army at Cuerte, 5 miles outside of Valencia. He was not wounded in this battle, nor did his mounted corpse lead his army to victory. Rodrigo then declared himself the ruler of the independent kingdom of Valencia, a de facto king. He ruled Valencia for 5 years, until his death in 1099. Then his widow Ximena ruled Valencia for 3 years, until an Almoravid army was about to retake the city in 1102. Ximena burned as much of Valencia as could be burned, rather than letting the city fall intact to the Moors.

The Moors were not completely driven out of Spain, until the Fall of Granada...in 1492, a date more famous for another event.

The title ""El Cid"" is popularly though to be from the Arabic word for ""Lord"". But that Arabic word ""sayyidi"" is more accurately defined as meaning ""chief"" or ""boss"". So...print (or in this case, film) the legend, and the result is an excellent epic film!

PS: Amazon's ""El Cid"" page states that there are no Special Features with the ""Two Disc Deluxe Edition"" of ""El Cid"". Well...my copy of the ""Two Disc Deluxe Edition"" of ""El Cid"" has a bunch of Special Features on the second disc . All of them excellent and informative...Hollywood Conquers Spain: The Making of ""El Cid""; Samuel Bronston: The Epic Journey of a Dreamer; Behind the Camera: Anthony Mann and ""El Cid""; Mikls Rzsa: Maestro of the Movies; Preserving Our Legacy: Gerry Byrne on Film Preservation and Restoration; Trailer Gallery. If Amazon is selling the same Two-Disc Deluxe Edition that I purchased when the DVD was first released (and which I very have purchased from Amazon), then Amazon needs to correct their Special Features misinformation.

Amazon's ""El Cid"" information lists the Aspect Ratio as 2.35:1. This is the Aspect Ratio for Technirama 35 mm release prints, the same anamorphic aspect ratio as CinemaScope and Panavision 35 mm. The Super Technirama 70 Aspect Ratio is 2.21:1, not as wide, but still a much larger screen image. 2.21:1 is the same release print aspect ratio as Todd-AO, Super Panavision 70 (non anamorphic print) and Ultra-Panavision 70 (anamorphic print). With Ultra-Panavision-derived Single Film Cinerama having an aspect ration of 2.70:1 to 2.75:1. And that's the cinematography geek aspect ratio information.",1413158400,2,5963,5.0385395537525355

3220907,3,B000WMFZMY,"This epic 1961 historical film, directed by Anthony Mann, has all the staples of the swashbuckling war film genre. We get Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren in a feisty romance, well-staged battle sequences with hundreds of extras, themes of honor and heroism, and religious conflict between Catholics and Muslims in 11th century Spain. As Rodrigo ""El Cid"" (the Lord) Diaz, Heston fights to unite feudal Spain -- Jew, Christian, Muslim -- in battle against fanatical North African Muslim armies of the Almoravid Empire. Known as the ""compassionate warrior,"" Rodrigo gets the standard Heston treatment here, bland but reliable. The film was Oscar nominated and lauded as a great spectacle upon its release to theaters. Director Martin Scorsese, quoted on the front of this DVD box, lists it among his favorite films. A lot of the macho posturing in the movie does remind one of Scorsese, who does ""tough guys"" better than almost anyone else.

Unfortunately, ""El Cid"" exhibits all the excesses of the epic war genre in addition to many of its virtues. At three hours and 15 minutes, it's an impossibly bloated film that often progresses at a plodding pace. It revels in medieval politics, feudal ceremonies, jousting, paternalistic courtship rituals, and dueling, to the point that it feels more generic than epic at times. Redeemed somewhat by the performances, the film sustains some degree of dramatic interest through the smoldering love-hate relationship of Heston's Rodrigo and Loren's Dona Ximena. Heston gives a surprisingly restrained and relaxed performance, coming at a high point in his career, and it meshes well with Loren. The passionate love-revenge triangle is a high point of the plot. But the film's generic action set pieces lack the iconic imagery of Heston's chariot race in Ben Hur or parting of the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments, to name two examples, and the film is too full of its own machismo to justify the three-plus hour running length.

This two-disc DVD release features a sparkling digital transfer that does ample justice to the best film that ""El Cid"" could wish for. The second disc is loaded with special features. In my book, it's not the greatest epic film ever made, but it's a pleasant diversion and an indispensable viewing experience for any fan of Charlton Heston epics.",1401580800,,2313,5.052356020942408

It is filmed in Cinemascope and has exquisite sets. One feels like one is in old Spain. The actors handle their roles with passion, honesty and historical accuracy. This is a wonderful film.

If one feels strong emotions between Heston and Loren it is because Heston felt slighted that Loren had been paid $1M while he was paid much less. Also, Loren was not aged through the film while Heston was aged and scarred. The only criticism I have of this DVD transfer is the sound balancing.

It places a particular emphasis on the fact that is true that El Cid was open to work with both Muslims and Christians and was inspired and respected by all, something that even in our own time has proven to be difficult all over the world. Hence we have a historical figure that was beyond his time and ours too. The romantic story between Jimena and El Cid also presents the challenges that a wife has to endure when married with a national hero and how much she had to suffer because of that. The epic scenes filmed in Spain are considered the best ever created for a movie and the castle where they were filmed is a tourist attraction near Valencia.

El Cid is a 1961 medieval epic based on the legends of Rodrigo de Bivar, the Spanish warrior who fought for the Spaniards and Moors during the 9th century. It was directed by Anthony Mann and stars Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren in the leading roles.

Charlton Heston is one of my all-time favorite actors. He brings just the right amount of warmth and range to his roles. I don't see why so many professional critics think he was a bad bad actor and that his Oscar win for Ben-Hur was one of the judges' worst decisions. I thought he was fiery and intense and subtle and quiet at just the right moments. His love for his mother, sister and fianc, faith in God and hatred for Messala was so strong and real and he brought layers of details to the role. Every performance I've seen (The Greatest Story Ever Told, Ben-Hur and El Cid.) is a gem. He always plays strong, devoted, courageous men and that's why I love him. His Rodrigo is a warrior of uncompromising integrity. Throughout the film, he treats even the people that wronged him (King Alfonso, Princess Urracca, Count Ordonez and even his wife at one point) with kindness, loyalty and friendship. Each one of these individuals is baffled as to why he would do such a thing.

Sophia Loren's performance as Rodrigo's wife Chimene is a little uneven. There are times when she goes into self-conscious frowns and says her lines like she was sight reading the script but she gets better as the movie progresses. Her first few scenes are rather dull and passive but I think the scene where she and Rodrigo are in the barn was well done and the part where she tells Alfonso off at the convent ""Would you punish the man who is Spain's only hope? It takes more than courage to be a king."" was good too. Probably her finest moment is towards the end of the first half where she begs her husband's forgiveness for trying to murder him. The resonance in her voice and look on her face (especially her eyes) says a lot.

Herbert Lom is terrific as the Islamic terrorist, especially in his first scene at the beginning of the movie. Frank Thring is very good in his very short part as the cowardly Moorish king Al Kadir. Raf Vallone (Count Ordonez) makes the slow gradual transformation from a back stabbing traitor to a loyal friend. John Fraser is excellent as the cruel, prideful, power-hungry King Alfonso and Genevieve Page as his sister Urraca should have had more than a few lines.

The art direction/set design and costumes are magnificent, particularly the interior of the convent and palaces and what were the Academy smoking giving those awards to West Side Story instead? Robert Krasker's cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Miklos Rozsa's music contains beautiful melodies and rich orchestration. He is definitely award worthy but he had already won Best Original Score for Ben Hur two years ago so it's understandable the Academy wasn't going to award him again so soon.

All in all El Cid is fine, solid entertainment and at times inspiring.",1383523200,,3231,4.746880570409982

He fought and died for what he believed in and in so doing became a legend:  ""The Cid"".

3221000,4,B000WMFZMY,"I'm old enough to remember when El Cid was first released. At that time Bronston had 2 major movies in distribution simultaneously: ""King of Kings"" and ""El Cid"".  For some reason I clearly remember the newspaper reviews of the two movies - almost verbatim. Something like this - ""King of Kings; a crumb of a film about a pyramid of a man.  El Cid; a pyramid of a film about a crumb of a man.""
El Cid is a series of ""spectacular"" scenes, held together by a loose plot and a love interest. The reason the word ""spectacular"" is in quotes is because statistically they meet the requirements of spectacle, having the requisite no. of extras milling around, fighting each other, cheering, or each waving one regulation Bronston cabbage to show how much they love El Cid for giving them food. Bronston desperately wanted to thrill his audiences, and he always does (or did) come up with some thrilling moments.  But like Wagnerian opera, the thrills are short lived, and quickly decay into schmaltz or tedium.  He was terrific on opening shots. He (and Anthony Mann) would choose just the right light and just the right angles for the sweeping Technirama 70 format, and produce images that stirred the soul. The voiceover narration - quiet and dignified - would set the scene in broad Homeric blank verse (""... and there came a time when Ben Yussuf and his men ..."") Miklos Rozsa would pump it up with a few ""look out here it comes"" opening bars ... and then ... then it all fell apart when the actors opened their mouths and spoke their cliched lines that sounded like they'd been taken from an end-of-term grade-school production.
Actually I could never understand why Bronston was so taken with Miklos Rozsa.  His scores are cloying and unimaginative.  Presumably his name on the credits was money in the bank.  If you turn off the picture and just listen to the music you have no idea if you're watching Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, or King of Kings. They are completely interchangeable.  He did manage to infuse the El Cid score with some Spanish and Moorish themes, but believe me, he is no Georges Bizet. They still sound like loud Rozsa schlock.  Dimitri Tiomkin would have been a far better choice.
Despite all my negativity I have a great sentimental attachment for El Cid, just because it is unique and outrageous, and because Bronston was such a character;  the nephew of Leon Trotsky, no less.  Far better men than I, including Marty Scorcese have professed their love for this flawed gem.

3221013,2,B000WMFZMY,"I really wanted to love EL CID. But somewhere in the ongoing and laborious pomp and circumstance of the Spanish court sequences in the first act it dawned on me that there wasn't much behind the facade. It was watchable, somewhat entertaining, but unfortunately introduced audiences to 1960s Charlton Heston -- while always superb whatever film, whatever scene -- that would see other movies like THE AGONY & THE ECSTASY and MAJOR DUNDEE, far cries from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS and BEN-HUR.

There have been comments about the fluctuating sound in the restoration print and rightly so. This may not be entirely the restored version's fault, since the film's director, Anthony Mann, later oversaw a similar bombastic earache, THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Here, though, everything feels fairly by the numbers when it should have been magnificent, especially in 70mm.

Finally, a word on Sophia Loren. Is she miscast? Certainly many would argue her merits to the film, but the misfire may more be in the lack of chemistry between her and Heston. Indeed, a quick scroll thru IMDb trivia for EL CID reveals a strong dislike the two leads harbored for each other. There's a lot of star wattage to go around in big budget epics like these, but something had to give -- and here it was the integral chemistry between the two that needed to carry the emotion of the film. Because it fails, so does this movie.",1372723200,,1398,4.796680497925311

3221019,3,B000WMFZMY,"This film has the feel of two films. The first - the portion prior to the Intermission -is a meandering, unfocused soap-opera in which characters revolve through Charlton Heston's door in highly episodic, over-wrought cameos. It has the feel of a 60s -70s epic (""The Longest Day"" comes to mind) in which a potpourri of marquee stars pass rapidly before you in an effort to assure them of their screen time. However, these ""stars"" were hardly marquee and their characters did little to develop the story. It is poorly plotted and paced. (Yes, plotted. Although ostensibly a historical film, it bears little resemblance to what is actually known about ""The Cid."")Worse, action abounds, but motivations are rarely clear. It is a drowsy time.

The second half is much more fun.  The story line tightens significantly and Charlton Hesston's acting soars. His performance during the humiliation of King Alfonso and the capture and subsequent defense of Valencia is Shakespearean, absolutely worthy of the great Olivier.

I give the first half two stars, the second five, an average of 3.5, which I must, reluctantly, round to 3 because the first half  takes more air time than the second.",1366588800,,1182,5.01530612244898

3221040,5,B000WMFZMY,"Charlton Heston. He was larger than life.
Standing over 6 feet, and broad enough to match, with chiseled features and a chin Bruce Campbell would envy, Charlton's gravelly voice and intense charisma all added up to a man born to play characters larger than life: Moses, Ben-Hur, George Taylor, and, of course, El Cid.

And what a performance he puts on!

The word epic is the most misused word in the English language. On social media sites, and especially Youtube, ignorant people use ""epic"" to refer to anything that remotely amuses them or is considered out of the ordinary. That is not the true meaning of epic. Epic means ""heroic; majestic; impressively great"", epic means The Ten Commandments, Lawrence of Arabia, and War and Peace.

Epic means El Cid.

Have you ever seen a good battle scene in film? The Battle for Hoth in Empire Strikes Back, the Battle of Aqaba in Lawrence of Arabia, The Battle of Helm's Deep in The Two Towers? You haven't seen anything until you've seen El Cid. Tens of thousands of extras, hundreds of horses, countless swords, huge siege engines, giant castles.
All right here!

What a sweeping spectacle El Cid is! Back when there were ACTUAL epics. Not CGI. Everything you see on the screen: giant battles, deadly jousts, tragic romance, giant castles, and amazing actors. Are all right there.

5 Stars. Strongest Recommendation!!",1351036800,,1364,4.883116883116883

3221042,4,B000WMFZMY,"I enjoy this movie EL CID.  One of Charlton Heston's good hero movies about the legendary medieval Spanish knight Rodrigo, an almost ""pure knight"", and Sophia Loren as Ximena his fiance and later relunctant wife who although must ""hate"" him due to him killing her father.  Great plot and a great villian make this a movie to enjoy.  Herbert Lom plays an ""evil"" Muslim Warlord and leader who wants to rid the ""infidels"" Catholic Spaniards out of Spain once and for all.  In the movie, Rodrigo shoes compassion for some Muslim WarChiefs he captures and so his ""nicname"" afterwards is ""Alsayyid"" meaning great lord or chief.  I won't go into the rest of the story since I don't do spoilers.  The music is great, the scenery of Spain is beautiful, and the other actors and actresses do a good job as well.  Okay, now to my complaints about the film.  Ready?

I always feel like this had the potential to be a truely magnificent and timeless film like Heston's other works such as ""Ben Hur"", ""The 10 Commandments"", ""Planet of The Apes"", BUT I think due to some overacting on all the main actors parts, the movie just falls a bit short of that.  I don't know why except maybe the director is at fault in this film.  Herbert Lom and some of the supporting actors are outstanding in this film though.  Plus, I hope they clean up the photography, because when I had this on VHS, the photography was grainy and overdubbing at parts.

Maybe I am being finicky, I just wish I could say this was an OUTSTANDING film instead of a GOOD film.  One of a few movies that could of been truely a well recognized classic but just falls short of its goal.  But hey, it is a good and historical film based on actual events in the history of Spain.  Like Heston says in this film, ""FOR GOD, ALFONSO, AND SPAIN!!""",1324252800,,1788,4.438650306748467

After all the cinematography and the score are magnificent. Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren do a pretty good job, though Sophia is--dare I say it?--a little wooden at times (always looks great though, with tears welling up in the eyes at appropriate moments). The biggest problem is probably the screenplay, which includes its share of absurdities First of all, Heston as El Cid is a little too noble for his own good. When he is betrayed and falls into an ambush, he decides to spare the one who set up the attack because he wants no more blood spilt on his wedding day. It seems that he has forgotten all the soldiers who had lost their lives because of this treachery. What about them? Don't they deserve justice? Obviously, there is no way a real warrior of the El Cid type would ever pardon this. However, the greatest absurdity comes at the end with a dead El Cid strapped to his horse galloping off into the Moors with everyone fleeing before him. It seems he will just keep galloping on along the shoreline forever, unable to stop--until (presumably) some hard and immobile object puts an end to his forward career.

3221060,5,B000WMFZMY,although the movie of El Cid was a great story in film. the real story of Rodrigo de Bivar is very Different. I saw this movie when it first came out in 1961. I loved it. I kept asking myself why did they allow Heston to age but kept Sophia young. The real Cid did not die in Valencia as the Movie shows. he went on to live a great Life and died of natural causes in 1066. He had two great Swords that he named Tizada. & colada. His horse was Called Braca Which is Latin for Crazy. His Twin Girls were married off to different men of rich Blood. But the Cid was not happy with this and he let the King know it. It is said that when he went into Battle he would grit his Teeth in excitment. He was loved by his fellow countrymen and he was hailed a Hero of Spain. It pains me so to see that on some of his Statues in Spain they have written some very unkind words. I can only think that some people just have to make trouble where ever you go. But for me the movie of El Cid will remain one of my Favorites. remember movies are for Entertainment. the Director will change the story to show his view on a story and make it interesting.,1298592000,2,1133,3.9304347826086956
3221061,3,B000WMFZMY,"The film's visuals are occasionally stunning, and, while the screenplay by Philip Yordan, Ben Barzman and Fredric M. Frank, from a story by Frank, is solid, one does wonder how differently a true film master like Michelangelo Antonioni would have handles such a film. We never get inside any of the characters because they act upon such a large stage that what they say and do almost does not matter, as it is dwarfed by the seeming weight of history. In a sense, the film is like a Frederic Edwin Church painting, wherein natural forces marginalize the efforts of man. The music score by Mikls Rzsa, was much lauded, but in retrospect, it does not hold up against the visuals of cinematographer Robert Krasker. Interestingly, perhaps the most important technical aspect that succeeds in this film is the editing by Robert Lawrence. Repeatedly, the scenes end before typical Hollywood reveals that hammer a point home, especially in epic films like this. There are dozens of examples, but note the scene where Cid kills Chimene's father. First, we never see the final deed, as both men are behind the staircase when Cid strikes his deathblow. Second, after getting Chimene to agree to avenge his death, we see her turn, to see Cid in darkness under the stairs, but then we get the fade. We never see the typical confrontation between the lovers That is delayed for a few minutes. What this shows is that Mann was handed an elephant, and did his best to leave some sort of imprint of himself on it.

  The film won some awards at the Golden Globes, and Oscars- mostly technical stuff, but it was a smash hit. The film is shown in a 2.20:1 aspect ratio and clocks in at almost three and a quarter hours in length, and comes in 1 three disk DVD package, as part of The Miriam Collection of films. Unfortunately, the film is split at its intermission, and spread across two DVDs. In this day and age, this is a major boner. Even worse is that the audio commentary is also split. The commentary, by Bill Bronston (son of producer Sauel Bronston) and Neal M. Rosendorf, a film historian, is ok, mentioning some of the unfortunate stereotyping that was portrayed, but it's nothing special. Perhaps the most insightful thing mentioned is how the film used Islamic expansion as a metaphor for the Cold War, whereas now it can be read literally, and how Sam Bronston was clueless as to the deeper themes in the film. Disk 1 features radio interviews with Heston and Loren, while Disk 2 has the featurettes. There's a making of featurette, a film on the career of Bronston as a producer, one on Anthony Mann'sd career as a director, one on the music of Mikls Rzsa, a film on film preservation, and a gallery of theatrical trailers. The worst extra feature, though, comes on Disk 3. There is nothing but a lengthy interview with a none too bright evangelist named John Bevere, who spends his whole interview as an apologist for Christianity, as well as spewing bizarre 1950s era ultra-nationalistic tripe, and generally misinterpreting the film. It's an embarrassing feature, and one wonders what connection to the people involved in the DVD this man has, and why he would be featured so prominently in the packaging.

  Overall, El Cid is a terrific popcorn movie to watch, but a film of depth and great art it's not. Akira Kurosawa would have really lifted a project like this into the heavens. These days, all of the thousands of extras would simply be added in via CG, so it is quite impressive to see a film that truly was epic in scope. I also prefer the old method of putting all the credits at the start of the film, and, of course, there's Charlton Heston. Simply put, Heston is the quintessential American Alpha Male Movie Star. John Wayne, Sylvester Stallone, Marlon Brando, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant, Rock Hudson. No one really compares, except for, perhaps, Gary Cooper. While this film does not test his acting chops the way Major Dundee did, nor is it as iconic as his roles in Planet Of The Apes nor The Ten Commandments, it may be the role Heston was most suited to play, for it seems that he is never straining, and always in his comfort zone. Regardless, watch El Cid if you want an idea of what the filmgoing experience was, at its best, during the middle of last century.",1283299200,4,4278,4.637203166226913
3221062,5,B000WMFZMY,"ALL I CAN SAY IS AWESOME FILM _ THEY DONT REALLY MAKE LIKE THIS TYPE ANYMORE IN HOLLWOOD.
My background: I am an avid movie buff and will be returning to school to study film, I look to these types of films to educate myself in my filmmmaking pursuits.

El Cid was directed by the extremely talented visionary director Anthony Mann, he also did Fall of the Roman Empire; and the set pieces for that FORE movie were incredible, built from scratch under the direction of Samuel Bronsteen/ the producer.  This type of Director is seldom seen in Hollywood and underappreciated ( and actaully this film was not made in Hollywood, or the U.S.)-- Mr. Mann was a true ""artist."" Too bad he didn't make more epic films.

 In my opinion The only other visionary directors in the industry that are somewhat comparable today would be Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan but I really think Anthony Mann is actually in a seperate class of viisonary directors, along with Cecil B. Demille.  I should mention also John Boorman who I thnk is equal to Anthony Mann (having made the epic film EXCALIBUR)in telling quality stories--Boorman is an incredible director.

THE ACTORS :

Charton Heston gave an incredible performance as the Spaniard Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar, known as El Cid. And Sophia Loren also gives an incredible performance.  All the acting was stellar from beginning to end!

The DVD I purchased has extra features where you learn that in making the film they employed the advisory input from the most noted scholar in Spain at that time who specialized in this specific time period of the history of Spain; so the they tried to make it as an historically accurate reflection of the real events that took place- however they did base many parts of the movie on a famous poem/book written by a French author.

I only wish we had more directors and producers like Mann and Bronsteen still with us today - they left a filmmaking legacy that that is unforgettable and aweinspiring.

In the period in which this film is set Spain is divided between Moors and Christians. Christian kingdoms are gradually gaining the upper hand but the threat of a new Muslim invasion from North Africa hangs over Moor and Christian alike. The harangue of Beni Yusef at the beginning sounds like it could have come right out of an al-Qaida propaganda video.

Charlton Heston plays el Cid, a Spanish noble who is respected by Christian and Moor alike. His is a struggle to fight the invaders while trying to make a king worthy of Spain.

There are alliances and changes in allegiance and even I had trouble remembering which kingdom was which in this fragmented version of Spain. But the movie speaks to honor, courage and nobility and as such is a wonderful movie.",1263254400,4,910,4.675

3221088,4,B000WMFZMY,"When El Cid finally came out in DVD in the US (after having been available in various DVD editions in Europe for years), the quality of the picture and sound really did the film justice--both were outstanding.  Unfortunately, although it says above that this version contains a Spanish-language soundtrack, it does not, and the producers really missed a bet here, in view of the enormous popularity of the legend of El Cid in the Spanish-speaking world.  It is particularly unfortunate because there already exists an extremely good Spanish-language soundtrack on the 2004 Region 2 DVD issued by Divisa Home Video--but this was unfortunately coupled with one of the most awful prints of the film imaginable, and the Divisa print of the film is almost unwatchable, despite the absolutely beautiful and superbly refined Castilian Spanish on its soundtrack.  There is also a (supposedly remastered) 2003 version with a Spanish language track available from Front Row Entertainment, but as I have not seen it I cannot vouch for either the picture quality or the quality of the Spanish language soundtrack.  How long will we have to wait before the Miriam Collection reissues this magnificent version, with digitally remastered picture and sound, with a Spanish (and perhaps French) language soundtrack, so that it can be enjoyed in the language in which this epic was written?  There is already a German-language Region 2 version of this digitally remastered version available in Europe, so it seems perverse that a version with Spanish, French, and possibly even a Portuguese language soundtrack is not yet available as an option to go with this marvelously clear and beautiful version.  In any case, despite what it says above, this version does NOT have a Spanish language soundtrack, and the Spanish subtitles that are available on it are inferior to those in the otherwise poorly recorded 2004 Divisa Home Video version available in Region 2.  So, for those who want to see the film in English (and have El Cid sound as if he lives in California, and Dona Jimena sound as if she lives in Naples, whereas both are supposedly from the same small area of Spain), this version is just fine--sound and picture are magnificent.  For those who would prefer to hear the wonderful Castilian soundtrack available on the Divisa version, there are no good options, as the picture quality on that version is terrible, and the Spanish language soundtrack on the digitally remastered version is nonexistent.",1259712000,2,2493,5.078239608801956

3221107,4,B000WMFZMY,"If you love historical epics, this one is a must-see. All my life I've wondered what a Spanish knight would be like. And for a while now I've wondered if anyone actually had the kind of chivalry that knights were supposed to be famous for in legends. Now I finally know.

At the start of the film the bloodthirsty Moores are preparing for a Jihad across Spain to wipe out the Christian Kings. One knight after fighting a battle against some of his Muslim adversaries decides to spare their lives if they will swear loyalty to his king. They do. As a result, he starts to build a reputation. The peace-seeking Muslims see his honor, loyalty, and valor, and start to refer to him as ""The Sid"", a brave warrior who works for peace. His king on the other hand is infuriated that he has spared his enemies. This chain of events sets in motion the rest of the film, wherein his wife-to-be becomes his enemy (after he is forced to duel her father who will not take back his accusations of treason from the man), his fights for and is eventually rejected by the kings of his country, and eventually leads a massive army of people loyal to him against the Warlord who could destroy all else at the cost of his own life.

If anybody could play this part perfectly, its Charlton Heston, and he does. His true love, on the other hand, is less convincing. Sure, Sophia Loren has the looks, but I'm afraid she looks far more convincing in the scenes where she hates him than the ones where she loves him (lots of that towards the end of the film). Everyone else in the film is splendid, but it's the cinematography and grandness of the film that's the real star (like Hen Hur or the 10 Commandments). The castles, fields, besieged cities, and royal courts convey a story of magesty and splendor and good old chivalry in a way that just can't be done anyone (no one can afford that many extras).

The one-on-one fight of champions to decide the fate of a city is my favorite part of the movie, because not only is it full of energy and power and drama (and excitement), but I've never seen anything like it on film. It's the stuff that teenagers dream of. Fighting for your leige lord so that armies won't have to, jousting, than fighting fiercely with broadswords. Awesome.

The restoration of the film is nothing short of magical, with the widescreen and glorious color making it a shining example of the beauty of old Hollywood. There's also a fantastic musical score by the legendary Miklos Rozsa. The movie is worth seeing just for the cinematography and the music alone, but the great story and rock-solid acting by the ruggedly-good-looking Heston make it a must-see for every lover of historical epics in the grand tradition.",1237161600,,2718,4.540816326530612

In the area of Spain which was correct for the times (1070-1088) there was not enough data to support why The Cid did what he did. I guess one must make the time to put 20 years of history in 3 to 4 hours, or is under the gun to create a credible movie.  The movie is excellent as to the time in history, its content and the roles.  I would reccommend the movie for its magnificent special effects ( for the time 1961), and its cast.

The battle scenes and the siege of Valencia in the second half of the movie are truly extraordinary with vivid scenery and beautiful costuming. Each frame is carefully crafted as in a painting and it is the craft that makes El Cid well worth watching.

The down side is the often wooden acting , more like posing in many scenes , of Sophia Loren and Charlton Heston. Loren looks stunning in every scene she is in and her beautiful face is framed in every conceivable form of headgear they could find. I almost found myself counting the number of different hats and hoods she wears from scene to scene and can't help but think that it was intentional to draw attention away from her inability to deliver a single convincing line. Heston huffs and puffs his way through the film and is introduced in many scenes with trumpet flares and pomp that serve the same purpose as Sophia's many hats.

While that sounds like a recipe for failure, the film delivers a spectacle that is really memorable and so it is worth it to sit through some of the more painfully slow scenes of Heston and Loren exchanging meaningful glances to get to the good stuff.

I give this 3.5 stars as a fine costume drama and a widescreen spectacle. You could do worse than to watch this with the sound muted.",1233014400,,1346,4.530864197530864

Nevertheless, they are marvelous together and if you happen to attend a revival showing of this film in Ultra Panavision--do see it.  I was fortunate enough to see this film in that wide format (2.75) several years ago in Berkeley but the Miriam edition is an excellent remastering. Compared to the over-rated, ponderous ""Ben Hur"", ""El Cid"" showcases Heston at his best particularly in the final scenes as the fallen hero riding to his eventual fate as mythic hero.  Exciting swordfights, splendant Spanish landscapes, the beauty of Loren and Anthony Mann's superb direction make this an all time winner which can be appreciated on a large screen (50' and above) flat panel HDTV.

I remember seeing this movie as a young teenager at least 10 times at the famous Wilten theater in Los Angeles on Saturday mornings and was delighted to find that it stands up to the test of time.  It is not a classic movie but for its time it provided great enterainment.  I will not go into the basic plot of the movie which is based on the Spanish legend of the Cid but I can say that it accommodated my memory of my childhood Saturday morning fun.  Great music, color, and action. With Ms Loren as the love interest and at the top of her beauty,how could a young teenage male not enjoy this film. The backgound DVD on the producer and story line explains in part why it took so long for this movie to be released on DVD. International events aside, this movie will provide ideal enterainment for the film buff.  I found this film better than the ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" also producted by the same film studio. Charlton Heston was at the top of his acting career at the time of the filming of El Cid and I will miss his style now that he has passed away.",1210636800,2,1227,4.182203389830509
3221164,5,B000WMFZMY,"EL CID takes its place among the great screen epics that never allow the eye-popping spectacle to dwarf the human characters--just as ""Ben-Hur"" was able to do. And who else to play the legendary and noble Spanish hero than CHARLTON HESTON. He's magnificent here, playing his central role with an almost Shakespearean grandeur, as do some of the other cast members, including HERBERT LOM, JOHN FRASER and GARY RAYMOND.

So is the epic sweep of the tale and the intimate love story that begins when he is on his way to wed SOPHIA LOREN and finds himself asked to assume the mantle of leadership against the Moors in 11th century Spain. He makes the journey from peace-broker accused of treason to the King's fighting champion and later from exiled hero to legendary martyr.

Aside from the brilliant cinematography, authentic looking locales and colorful costumes, Miklos Rozsa's score adds a great deal to the intensely dramatic intimate scenes as well as the epic battles, all the while suggesting some Spanish motifs amidst the heraldic fanfares and love theme.

CHARLTON HESTON makes an impressive figure of El Cid, especially good in the final moments as the wounded leader who knows what he must ask his wife to do so that his followers do not lose heart after his death. RAF VALLONE as Count Ordonez, GENEVIEVE PAGE as Princess Urraca, JOHN FRASER as Prince Alfonso and GARY RAYMOND as Prince Sancho are all remarkable effective in strong supporting roles. In lesser roles, HURD HATFIELD and FRANK THRING bring their own brand of authority to minor parts.

Anthony Mann and his assistant directors have done an outstanding job on all of the battle scenes and he never falters in telling the tale in strong dramatic terms. There's an intensity in the scenes between Loren and Heston after he has been forced to kill her father for humiliating his own father in front of the court. Whatever friction there was between Heston and Loren on the set, works for them here because her animosity toward him is a chilling thing to watch.

The DVD has been wonderfully mastered and all of the Miklos Rozsa score sounds better than ever with Overture, Intermission and Exit music reminding us all what a treasure he was as a film composer.",1210118400,3,2232,4.832460732984293
3221165,4,B000WMFZMY,"In the wake of Charlton Heston's death, I decided to have a marathon viewing of his films. I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen.

""El Cid"" was one I had not watched before, probably because it only recently became available on DVD. As he often did, Heston plays a real-life character, an 11th-century Spanish hero who sought to unite his country. It is one of those epic historical films Heston specialized in, and it does a good job of conveying that time and place. Although set 1,000 years ago, the themes of the story still resonate today.

One of the things I like about these films is that they were made pre-CGI, so they were generally shot on location and much of the spectacle was actually staged for the cameras (No computer-generated armies here).

The Cid was a complex character and, unlike some of his other roles, Heston plays him in an understated way. The Cid was valiant and loyal, a selfless warrior loved by the people. He preached tolerance and tried to show that all Muslims were not evil. But he was humble and deferential to a fault, putting his sense of duty to country and king before everything, even his family.

There are some grand action scenes: a spectacular jousting duel and several large scale battles. The musical score is sweeping and beautiful. Yes, there is some melodramatic acting in places, but overall the performances are good.

The central love story did not work for me, however. The Cid's relationship with Chemene, played by Sophia Loren, is up and down throughout the film: first she loves him, then she hates him, then she loves him. They do not spend enough time together to make a convincing case that this was a great love affair.

If you like behind-the-scenes features, there are several interesting documentaries on the second disc: one deals with the making of the film, then there are bios of the producer, the director, the composer, and an odd little piece on some guy who works in film preservation.

All in all I would recommend ""El Cid"" to anyone who likes Charlton Heston and big historical films. As they say, they don't make `em like this anymore.",1209686400,4,2155,4.670184696569921
3221166,4,B000WMFZMY,"El Cid is a great depiction of Medieval Spain! There is enough violence to satisfy most prurient interests. In addition, the beauty of Sofia Loren, the pageantry and chivalry of the royal court, and the intrigue of familial politics make for a dynamic presentation of the life and times of Spain's greatest hero.
The plot follows the storyline of the ""Song of the Champion El Cid"" as it has come down through the centuries. There are a few factual discrepancies but they do not severely hinder the appreciation of the art of this epic.",1208476800,,535,4.702127659574468
3221167,5,B000WMFZMY,"If you want a story that is close to accurate with the splendor of actors and extras instead of CGI, this is the movie. What a story! They just do not make them like this anymore and the two main actors are right on!",1208476800,,216,3.9318181818181817
3221168,5,B000WMFZMY,"I love these big epics from the 30s-60s, and Samuel Bronston was almost as good at churning them out as the master, Cecil B. (besides El Cid, he notably did such classics as Fall of the Roman Empire, 55 Days at Peking and King of Kings), and El Cid is one of his best.

It has awesome production values (a great climactic battle scene and the best one-on-one joust ever filmed, bar none) and a very entertaining story. The acting is first rate, not only from the stars (I think Heston gives one of his best, most restrained (if that is the right word) performances and Sophia Loren never, ever looked more beautiful) but also from the supporting actors, Raf Vallone and Gary Raymond, in particular.
All in all, a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours.

One other thing.  An aspect of films often overlooked is very much in the fore here, the background musical score.  It is an aspect of films, especially epic specataculars, that is absolutely essential to the complete experience and this one is scored by one of the great masters of the genre, Miklos Rozsa (Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Julius Caesar and so on ad infinitum), at the absolute top of his form.  I hope someday that someone does a release of the FULL score on CD and gives it full justice, something long overdue.

I'm not one of those folks who necessarily thinks that older is better, but I do think Hollywood either has forgotten how to (or more likely can't afford to) make these spectacular costume epics like they once did.  Epics today are made for the MTV generation, which may not be bad, but it's certainly different and not as much to my taste.

Test it yourself. Watch this movie and say Spartacus or Ben-Hur and then watch Gladiator and say any one of the Superman movies. You might be surprised by which one has more satisfying acting, writing, plot-lines, set pieces and music (although I must admit Williams' score to Superman I is one of the half-dozen best ever composed).

At any rate, thanks for this one Sam.  You'll find it money well spent.  Bring on Fall of the Roman Empire and 55 Days, please!!!",1207699200,,2088,4.55614973262032

3221211,4,B000WMFZMY,"Aroused by a fanatical Moorish warlord, emir-king attack a Castilian village, where they are captured by Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar...

Vigorously brave and compassionate, the noble Rodrigo hates bloodshed and vows to see his country at peace, frees the prisoners on their solemn pledge never again to attack Castile...

For this act of courage and mercy, one of the Emirs, Moutamin, calls Rodrigo ""El Cid,"" and pledges eternal friendship to the Cid of Vivar... And so, in freeing the Moors, Rodrigo, accidentally, stumbled onto a battle, not to his luscious bride, but to a battle that will change his whole life...

In the court of King Ferdinand, Rodrigo's act of clemency is misinterpreted, and he's accused of treason by his rival Don Ordonez for refusing to turn over to him the captures Moors...

Unfortunately, Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, is slapped by the Champion of the king, Count Gormaz, father of his beloved Chimene... Rodrigo begs Gormaz an apology; it is refused... A duel begins and the champion is badly wounded... Before he dies, however, he asks Chimene to avenge his death...

Chimene's wish is fulfilled when King Ramiro of Aragon challenges King Ferdinand for the possession of the city of Calahorra by the outcome of a single combat...El Cid convinces the king to permit him to fight Don Martin...Thus, according to the custom of trial by combat, God would judge Rodrigo's guilt or innocence...

""El Cid"" is an intense film, lavish and spectacular, bigger than any in terms of cast and impressive as any in visual terms... Mikls Rzsa gave a new dimension to the emotion that Anthony Mann was trying to express...

Mann gives us a human story with a love story balanced with the most strongly image of a hero the world has ever seen... He presented a man of honor who thinks always of his wife, his country, and his king first... Even in death, his thoughts are for others and not himself...

El Cid insults kings and noblemen in the name of justice and integrity and does what he knows to be right... He battles the king's living sword in respect of his father... He accepts the challenge of a champion of a king to prove himself innocent of treason and other things... He shows a prince how any man can kill and only a king can give life... He fights 13 knights, at the same time, to free a prisoner... Yet he is in addition to all of this an extremely principled leader... He accepts exile for life from the country he loves, and yet he is the only man in Spain who 'could humble a king and would give a leper to drink from his own pouch...'

The joust sequence called ""The fight for Calahorra,"" is perhaps the most rousing, exciting, one-to-one combat ever filmed... The battle scenes at Valencia are taken on an epic scale... But the value of Anthony Mann's movie is the characterization in which Charlton Heston played El Cid's life... For this reason alone, the film is of greater value than most any other motion picture experience...",1207353600,2,2967,4.712355212355212

Director Anthony Mann, better known at the time for his well-regarded Westerns with James Stewart ('Winchester '73', 1950; 'The Naked Spur', 1952; 'Bend of the River', 1953; 'The Far Country', 1954), Henry Fonda ('The Tin Star', 1957) and Gary Cooper ('Man of the West', 1958), put his best foot forward in this 1961 telling of the unification of Spain in the XIth Century, with Charlton Heston (lost half of my audience right there) at his heroic best in the title role, with Sohia Loren as Ximene, at her most enticing. The factual elements may be glossed over - what historic movie doesn't? But, to paraphrase William Randolph Hearst: ""...publish the legend,"" especially when it serves as good entertainment.

*Good photography.  Excellent sets and exterior shots.  Great epic views of the armies, battles, and fights.
*There are a few good fights and a few good battle scenes.
*Some of the characters are interesting.
*Pretty good story with lots of thrilling or suspenseful scenes.
*Good costume and set design.

The Bad Things
*Very long.  Lots of drama and dialogue.
*This is not Charlton Heston's best performance.
*Some parts that make you ask ""why?"" Why didn't Rodrigo pull the arrow out of his chest? Why did everybody have such a grudge against him? Ugh.

Despite being long, drawn-out, and bewildering at times, this is a pretty good epic.  It definately has a lot of big scenes with massive armies and intense duels.  Much of the story's conflicts focuses on all the different grudges everybody seems to have against the main character.  It's almost contrived; how could the King, his champion, all of the princes, and the princess be so dumb and hate this guy for such a long time? Still, it makes for some interesting drama that might keep the audience awake throughout.

I recently purchased and watched this remastered DVD and was again blown away.  I had my 10 year old son sit and watch it with me and he was captivated!  I think that this is one of the biggest epics of all time.  Charlton Heston is at his Ben Hur and Ten Commandments prime and a true hero.

3221218,5,B000WMFZMY,"While the events in this movie are based on actual events, the movie does not pretend to be historically accurate in all things.  The movie is as much about the legend of El Cid as it is about the real El Cid.

This is one of the epic movies that Hollywood is famous for making many years ago.  It is long, but it is still 40 minutes shorter than Ben Hur.  Because of its length, the movie itself is on two DVDs.  The last chapter on the first DVD is actually the intermission.  I fast-forwarded through the intermission to get back to the movie only to find out that I had to put the other DVD in.  It would have been good to either delete the intermission or to give some warning that there is no movie after the intermission.

The casting in this movie is great.  Sophia Loren is a pefect contrast to Charlton Heston.  She brings a lot of passion to her role which is what was needed of her.  Charlton Heston does a great job in a role that he was born to do.

The only actor that threw me was Herbert Lom as the leader of the invading Muslim army.  He only has about 5 minutes in the movie, but I had trouble seeing him as a dangerous fundamentalist.  All I could think of when I saw him was his role as Chief Inspector Dreyfus in the Pink Panther Movies.  I realize that El Cid came out before these movies, but the association is very strong in my mind.

The visual quality of the movies is great in this new format.  I saw this years ago on VHS and the inprovement is amazing.  The audio is less than perfect.  The music is louder than the dialog in a lot of parts.

I give this DVD set 5 stars even while acknowledging some negatives because this is such a great movie.  It is a great movie to have in your collection.",1205280000,,1726,4.107784431137724

I remember seeing both on Broadway the theatres were across the street from each other , El Cid at the Warner and King of Kings at the Loews State.

  While King of Kings has been on DVD for about 5years it's a pleasure finally to have the long awaited El Cid. The film itself focuses in on the struggles of a nation and the struggles of individuals all of which
are resolved by the end of the film. I don't know why Bronston chose Philip Yordan to script the screenplay. I felt at times it was a little tedious. Supported by a triumphant score by Miklos Rozsa ( King of Kings ,Ben Hur ) and great acting and cinematogrsphy it was a great

Entire industries sprang up whole to create the costumes, saddles, weaponry, armor and other items required for the movie.  The sword making industry in Toledo was reinvigorated when the word went out the company didn't want any cheap flimsy props for their epic picture.  The Spanish army, and their horses, were hired to portray the thousands of soldiers required in the battle sequences. Something like this will probably never be duplicated again in the real world, and CGI can't reproduce what you see on the screen in ""El Cid.""

Charlton Heston, with a towering physical presence and Shakespearean training, was Hollywood's go-to-guy for epic heroes (as Ben Hur in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ben-Hur-Four-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0009UZG1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ben-Hur (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, or as Moses in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments-50th-Anniversary-Collection/dp/B000CNESNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments (50th Anniversary Collection)</a>).  He does not disappoint as ""El Cid.""  Heston does an outstanding job bringing to life ""one who lived and died the purest knight of all.""  El Cid is a man who, with the admiration and respect of both Christians and Moors, defeats an invasion force and units Spain under one king.  Sophia Loren, at the height of her beauty, makes an incomparable wife to the legendary hero. The supporting cast are also excellent.

The restored version of this movie looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous.  This is worth seeing on the largest screen with the best surround sound you can manage.  ""El Cid"" is one of the last movies with a full length score and, although it has been chopped up a bit to allow for a few minutes of sound affects (war drums, clanging swords, etc.) it is a reminder about how much music can lend to a film. For example, one character's death occurs off screen in shadow; we know he is dead because the music informs us.

This two disc package breaks up the film during the intermission section.  Disc 1 contains the first half of the film and special features, including a commentary track.  Disc 2 contains the second half of the film and additional special features including the second half of the commentary, the making of, and informative shorts about the cinematography, the music of Miklos Rozsa, restoration, and more.  The commentary is generally good with a lot of information and anecdotes, but from time to time veers off on annoying political tangents. All together this is a marvelous package!

His final ride into legend is unforgettable.

3221272,4,B000WMFZMY,"From the opening overture, it's evident that El Cid is going to be epic. And it positively doesn't disappoint. With distinguished knights-in-shining-armor, swordfights, illustrious battles, damsels in distress, evil kings, calculating queens, and soaring music, El Cid encompasses everything you'd come to expect from a rousing historical adventure epic.

In 1080 A.D. Rodrigo Diaz (Charlton Heston) lives by an honor that outweighs convenient principles, and on his way to Spain he decides to set free a group of five enemy Moors. The invading Moors are forever indebted to his mercy and justice (and he is dubbed ""El Cid""), but the King's champion, Count Gormaz, declares Rodrigo a traitor. When Rodrigo's father stands up for him in court, his name is shamed, and to regain his honor Rodrigo is forced to kill the Count. Gormaz, however, is the father of Rodrigo's true love Chimene (Sophia Loren), who now makes it her duty to see the Cid die. Distraught at the loss of his love, he asks King Ferdinand to allow him to fight the neighboring king for the fate of the city of Calahorra. After besting the knight Don Martin, El Cid is granted the hand of Chimene in marriage, but her hatred causes her to leave him for a convent.

When Ferdinand dies, he leaves his kingdom to his three children, who all greedily scheme to rule the whole of Spain. Sancho (Gary Raymond) attempts to imprison Alfonso (John Fraser), who is later freed by El Cid, and Princess Urraca (Genevieve Page) eventually becomes a puppet-master, distempering the court and orchestrating the assassination of Sancho so that Alfonso can claim the throne for himself. El Cid finds himself banned from the realm when he attempts to uproot the assassination plot, and only after he has lost everything, Chimene realizes that her life is not complete without him, and she asks to accompany him in his journey away from Spain.

The African warlord Ben Yussuf (Herbert Lom) takes advantage of the feuding leaders of Spain, and begins his conquest of the land, first by attacking Valencia. Recruited once again by a huge army of faithful followers, El Cid must use all of his legendary bravery, courage, war tactics and strategy to defeat the mighty Yussuf, all without the aid of King Alfonso, who condemns Cid for his use of unified Moorish kings who all find a common enemy in Yussuf.

Rodrigo is driven by a sense of honor that is perhaps indefinable when it crosses paths with happiness. Like Sir Thomas More in ""A Man For All Seasons"" Cid is compelled to act according to righteousness and duty, even when those he assists plainly condemn his reasoning. His honor causes him to cross the wrong people, often repeatedly, but luck, God, or a combination of both see that he serves as a deity to his own advocates. More unbelievable and yet cinematically beautiful is his relationship with Chimene, who from a sense of duty herself decides she must pursue his death, even though she is torn with undying love for him. But most fascinating of all is her eventual change of heart and their reuniting only after El Cid is banished from Spain with a simple act of prideful virtue. All that he originally worked for to free his name of calumny has vanished, but with Chimene by his side, he is left with the only thing that matters.

There are no longueurs present in El Cid - it starts right into the action from the opening scene, and despite its three-hour running time, keeps up interest and suspense with sweeping romance, nail-biting jousting, whirling flails, zinging arrows, treacherous assassins, clanging swords, sieges, and large scale infantry skirmishes. While it is not a flawless film, El Cid captures the grandiose feel of other historical giants like Ben-Hur and Spartacus, and is a film that has long awaited an elaborate home video release, presented for the first time on DVD January 29th, 2008 in the first of hopefully many Miriam Collection volumes.

Two years ago I bought a DVD of El Cid and the reviews were horrible, but I just had to have the movie. They were right...it was like a terrible video transfer and had Chinese writing all over it.  That should have been my first clue!  The new one released last week was beautifully remastered in stunning color and clearity.  The 5.1 stereo sound makes it truly a pleasure to watch and listen to.  I highly recommend this movie to all classic movie buffs like myself.

3221276,5,B000WMFZMY,"In a time when large scale epics were commonplace, ""El Cid"" stands out from the rest of the pack.  Maybe because it was made apart from the major studios that it lacks the sheen but is no less polished.  Also, director Anthony Mann, who cut his teeth on psychological Westerns, pays as much attention to characterization but doesn't skimp on the spectacle.  Credit too has to go to Charlton Heston who is old hat at carrying these large scale epics.  Heston's Cid, after Ben-Hur, has to be my favorite performance by him.  Heston never gets credit for his formidable acting skills, probably dismissed because of his right-wing politics.  Note:  Will somebody please re-issue ""The Warlord"" on DVD.  Sophia Loren as the film's romantic interest is equally glamorous and shows herself to be an adept actress.  Throw in a classic Miklos Rosza score and you have a film that is indispensible.  Marty Scorsese is right in proclaiming ""El Cid"" as one of filmdoms great epics.  Bring on ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""(coming in April).",1202342400,3,1027,4.844827586206897
3221307,2,B000WMFZMY,"I remember as a child falling asleep at the Skyway Drive-in trying to make it through ""El Cid."" And now some 40 years later I find myself falling asleep on the couch trying to get through the wooden acting of Charlton Heston, the lamentable miscasting of Sophia Loren and the dreadful overacting of a mediocre supporting cast, all failing to bring life to the preachy, melodramatic script.

The greatest epic ever filmed? I don't think so. That label belongs to the one and only ""Lawrence of Arabia."" It's war scenes are better; it's cast impeccable; and it's script literate and human. Even David Lean's misfire ""Ryan's Daughter"" is a much satisfyling film than ""El Cid.""

I haven't been impressed by Scorcese's films in the past decade and think he has constantly miscast Leonardo di Caprio. ""The Departed"" was a rip-off of the last dozen films of Clint Eastwood.

Marty, go back to making films and stop concentrating on being the high guru of film history. If you were impressed by ""El Cid"" when you were a boy, you must have been terribly deprived. When I lived in New York, there was certainly more drama on the streets than in this insufferably boring film.

3221311,5,B000WMFZMY,"Producer Samuel Bronston's masterpiece, the 1961 epic, ""El Cid"", is at last on digitally-remastered DVD, in a two-disc edition that positively glows! The finest (and most expensive) 'Chivalry' film ever made, the film combines intimacy and monumental battle scenes (without CGI!), drenched in an opulence that will never be equaled.

One of the great pleasures of this long-awaited release is the second disc's Special Features, which provides the astonishing back story of the film, as well as features on Bronston, director Anthony Mann, film composer Miklos Rozsa, and ""El Cid's"" incredible restoration process. This was a film that defied the 'Hollywood system' in every way; Bronston, a freewheeling, frequently in-debt entrepreneur, stonewalled in Hollywood, literally turned Madrid into a film capital, spending every penny he could raise, every favor he could ask, in producing the film with all the richness it deserved. With a 'terrible' screenplay (by Philip Yordan), that an uncredited Ben Barzman would have to rewrite from scratch, as filming began, a respected director (Mann), who had just been publicly humiliated by being fired as director of ""Spartacus"" (replaced by Stanley Kubrick), and two of the hottest actors in the world (Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren), who despised each other (Heston, with a history of on-set temperament, particularly toward female co-stars, discovered Loren was being paid more than he was!), this production seemed doomed from the outset.

But Bronston was a man of limitless vision and energy, and could accomplish miracles! He got the DuPont family to financially back the production, convinced Spanish dictator General Franco to loan him nearly the entire Spanish army for battle scenes (second directed by the legendary Yakima Canutt), recruited entire villages to serve as extras, and backed Mann's vision, creating one of the most beautifully composed films in the history of the cinema.

Much to everyone's (except Bronston and Mann's) surprise, ""El Cid"" was a worldwide critical and commercial hit, and one of 1961's biggest blockbuster successes, influencing a generation of young filmmakers, and becoming a capstone to the careers of many of the participants.

While it is a crime that the film has been largely unseen for over forty years, this 2-Disc Deluxe Edition should again bring ""El Cid"" the respect it richly deserves.

It is absolutely ESSENTIAL for any film lover's collection!",1201737600,26,2449,5.400523560209424

3221315,5,B000WMFZMY,"Like Mann's other well-known feature, ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" El Cid has a lot going for it: breathtaking Spanish scenery and fabulously authentic set pieces, two very competent and attractive leads with Heston and Loren, and an interesting protagonist whose story is steeped more in myth than reality.

Although this DVD has not yet been released, this film, like ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" is worthy of a ""special edition"" replete with interviews, extras, a behind-the-scenes documentary, deleted scenes, and the like--should they even exist. The film was released almost 45 years ago.

While not as opulent as ""Fall"" that would be released three years later, the love story between Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (El Cid) and Chimene, his wife is a more interesting one--as interesting as the story of the Cid himself.

These are characters one feels emotionally attached to unlike those of Livius and Drusilla in Mann's 'Fall,"" which resembles yet an additional prop to the sets to Mann's $16 million dollar epic, but Mann got off relatively cheap with ""El Cid,"" utilizing many of the existing medieval castles that dot the coastlines of sunny Spain.

Chimene loves Rodrigo who is to be her husband, than hates him for killing her father who insults Rodrigo's father and his family name. She marries Rodrigo out of spite at the request of King Ferdinand, and Chimene colludes to kill Rodrigo with a fellow conspirator who also loves her. Later, she ultimately learns to love this selfless knight who shows mercy to his enemies, earns their respect, and defends a brat of a king who is nothing more than a spoiled tyrant--wonderfully played by popular 60's British mod, John Fraser who would later win a coveted supporting role in Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion.""

The movie gets 5 stars despite the fact that battle scenes seem rather brief and could have been better orchestrated on a slightly more lavish scale. Mann's ""Fall"" clearly has an edge here; what we see in ""El Cid"" for the majority of the film are really skirmishes of no more than 15 to 20 men at a time. The Miklos Rosza score, obviously influenced by the achingly beautiful coda in Tchaikovsky's Symphony 4, and like all of his splendid soundtracks, will compel an exhaustive search for the compact disc at your local retailer. Clearly, this is music to be savored like a fine Castillian wine.

This was a role Heston was born to play: physical, larger than life, and majestic in scope. In a death-scene that is perhaps one of the longest, most touchingly portrayed, and perhaps Heston's finest in an epic like this, will move you as will the story of this heroic 11th Century knight who attempted to unite his divided Spain.",1200441600,,2688,4.8708971553610505

It prompted me to visit the base library to see what I could find on the Cid.  I remember being very disappointed when I found out he wasn't exactly what Hollywood portrayed in the movie.  It didn't matter....the movie is a gem and I saw it again and again.

Anthony Mann hit a homerun when he put Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren together on the screen.  The magic is obvious from the first scenes of them together.  A gripping screenplay, great locations, terrific photography, and an excellent score by Miklos Rozsa make this movie a benchmark for film making of another era.  This, as another reviewer mentions, is the last great movie of Heston's to be released.  Shame, shame for it taking so long.

Are we too sensitive today for the contents of this film?  Too politically correct?  I hope not.  The peaceful coexistence of Islam and Christianity, a topic touched on in the film, certainly is a topic of importance today.  But that shouldn't be the main idea behind viewing this film.
