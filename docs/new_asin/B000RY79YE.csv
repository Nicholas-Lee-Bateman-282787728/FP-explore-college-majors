2876643,1,B000RY79YE,"Do not believe the reviews that rate this video at four stars or higher. I based my purchase decision on those reviews and was utterly disappointed with this product. The video consists of two small-scale convention workshop presentations that were videotaped and slightly edited to incorporate changes in camera angles and to display full-screen what the audience could see projected onto the wall. The video contains a warning at the beginning saying that the comic strip publishers don't allow their comics to be used in videos, so those comics that were presented during the workshops aren't shown on this video. Since the two presenters seem to refer to a comic strip every four minutes, that means you spend lots of time watching them talk about something you can't see yourself. The workshops have many characteristics of amateur presentations, such as reading verbatim what appears on presentation slides, and the two presenters don't have a very charismatic manner of delivering their content. Watching this video is like being in an insufferable class or business meeting. If you want to know what the authors teach about logic, get their books (which are somewhat worthwhile but also overrated). Avoid this video: boring, boring, boring!",1217030400,31,1248,5.213930348258707
2876644,4,B000RY79YE,"This production upholds the Bluedorns' reputation for solid teaching presented with sharp dry wit.  Hans and Nathan's labor makes this vital subject accessible to ""common folk.""

My young sons especially enjoy the bonus track which chronicles a caving adventure.

Hans and Nathan are heroes in our house!",1195516800,5,304,5.425531914893617

Hans & Nathaniel Bluedorn
[...]

Having already used The Thinking Toolbox and getting ready to go through The Fallacy Detective with my oldest child (and having reviewed both of those items previously), I was asked to view this DVD workshop and review it on this blog. The DVD shows a taped workshop that Hans and Nathaniel Bluedorn gave at a homeschool meeting in Wisconsin. The tape is well-done and the material covered presented in a straight-forward and easy-to-understand method. The inside of the DVD cover contains LOTS of information about the fallacy material covered in the workshop. In addition, you can print off a brief handout by placing the DVD into your computer.

There are two different presentations on the DVD. The first part is about learning how to think logically, while the second part explains how to use the logic tools that you have learned to spot a hoax, reason through opposing viewpoints and produce a good scientific experiment.  The DVD is geared towards ages 10-adult, although the Bluedorns state that the study of logic doesn't usually begin until age 13 when students are better able to use their reasoning and logic skills.

In my opinion, this DVD offers a general introduction to logic and should NOT take the place of studying The Thinking Toolbox or The Fallacy Detective. Both of the books offer a lot more detail on the subject and I highly recommend them. You can see a few examples from the DVD on their website - click here. While the material presented is interesting and the examples are fun, Hans and Nathaniel are pleasant, quick-witted but also a bit subdued in their presentation. This is not a bad thing, but kids used to watching crazy cartoons (yes, we still watch cartoons in our home!) or fancy, fast-paced movies may need to watch this DVD in smaller increments. My Asperger's child would probably need to break it up into 20-30 minute viewings so that he wouldn't lose interest.

Because I have a hearing impaired child, I always review items from this other perspective. Because their workshop is done using a computer program (PowerPoint?) projected on a screen, my daughter would be able to understand most of it. Due to copyright laws, the funny cartoons of The Far Side, Calvin & Hobbes and the like that are used to explain some of the logic ideas presented are NOT allowed to be shown on the DVD. However, the cartoons are read out by the Bluedorns and so the viewing audience can get the basic idea of what is going on in the cartoon.

Overall, I believe Logic in 100 Minutes to be a good introduction to the idea of why it is important to study logic and how useful it would be to have this basic knowledge. I will be viewing this DVD with my son next year before we begin the study of The Thinking Toolbox as I know it will pique his interest! However, I still believe their books are more detailed and worth the purchase! You can buy any of these items at their site, [...]",1187395200,21,2979,4.653992395437262
2876646,4,B000RY79YE,"Having just watched this DVD, I was impressed with Hans and Nathaniel Bluedorn's ability to make a discussion about logic fun and interesting. In their workshop presentation format, they were able to tell viewers of the various types of fallacies in an informative manner. This is a DVD that would appeal to wide range of ages from children to adults. The DVD also contains a list of the books they recommend and their workshop handouts.",1184889600,5,437,4.84
2876647,4,B000RY79YE,"This educational DVD features two 50-minute workshops conducted by Hans and Nathaniel Bluedorn, authors of The Fallacy Detective and The Thinking Toolbox.  Offering a basic introduction to logic, topics overviewed in these workshops include logical fallacies, propaganda, opposing viewpoints, and tools for scientific thinking. Being a videotaped seminar, their use of visual aids and entertaining images enhance the home viewers experience. And the wise cracks and cartoons, used to make a point, keep the mood light and atmosphere fun. However, due to copyright protection laws, they were unable to videotape the cartoon overheads they used in the workshop. Home viewers will hear the caption read, but with the cartoon image missing it wasn't as funny - though we still got the point of the message. Overall, this DVD is a good way to introduce your family to logic and can serve as a springboard for further study - additional book recommendations and workshop handouts (via PDF format) are included in the DVD.",1184112000,3,1015,5.265432098765432

8203100,2,B000RY79YE,"It is unfortunate that I must give this DVD a 2 Star rating because the books ""The Fallacy Detective"" and ""The Thinking Toolbox"" by Nathaniel Bluedorn and Hans Bluedorn are excellent and well worth the purchase and reading on the topic of Logic and fantastic resources for teaching logic basics to your children.  Presentation is the primary problem with this DVD.  This DVD is one of the poorest that I have seen in some time.  The Bluedorn brothers would be wise to find people that are experts in presentation and re-produce a replacement to this DVD and doing so could actually encourage viewers to watch and learn instead of turning it off within the first 10 minutes.

PS: Anybody who dismisses this and or the books by these two authors on the basis of them being published by a Christian Company is committing a ""Logic Fallacy"".",1421539200,3,1023,5.132530120481928
8203101,1,B000RY79YE,"VERY dry, not engaging, suffered through 20 minutes hoping it would get better before shutting it off. Because so many of the examples are from comics which they are not allowed to show on video (copyright issues) they talk about things you can not see. so wish I hadn't bought it.",1392854400,,281,4.529411764705882
8203102,1,B000RY79YE,"We have used the logic books by the authors and love them.  They are well written and interesting.  The DVD is a poor quality video recording.  The sound quality makes it very difficult to follow.  Frequently, the speakers talk about their slides but the slides are cutoff and you can't see them.
We thought this would a good, ""fun"" homeschool DVD, but we turned it off after 30 minutes of hoping it would get better.  I do not recommend it.  However, both books by the same authors are excellent homeschool resources.",1345507200,11,518,4.637362637362638
8203103,2,B000RY79YE,"The first part of this video's content was done really well, though the comics being unseen while discussed was a bit more than amateur on the part of the speakers - at the time of recording they were doing homeschool conferences all the time and should have redone this so that they could be seen when they watched the replay and noticed how the were not visible at all. I then concluded that therefore they must be illegally using copyrighted materials in their presentations, however some of the comics that are spoke of in the video turn out to be in their book Logical Fallacies.

I don't know why on earth they would put the product out in this condition - as it seems illogical to presenting themselves in such an unprofessional manner. We did get some good tips and insight, but would have been much better off just going straight to the logical fallacies lesson book - which is a great product!",1322179200,4,903,4.539877300613497
8203104,1,B000RY79YE,"The cover of this gives the impression that it is useful for teaching logic to elementary and middle school students.
Instead of being simple and informative, this is just 2 awkward men standing in front of a blank projection screen and attempting to make jokes about logical reasoning and illogical thought. To their credit, the original presentation must have had cartoon illustrations on the screen, but due to copyright infringement, they could not display them on the DVD.

My children would have enjoyed a college level logic class more than this DVD. There are many alternative resources to use to teach children logic -- this DVD only serves to bore them into the belief that logic is only for nerds.",1315699200,5,708,4.9
8203105,1,B000RY79YE,"This was one of the worst presentations I have ever seen. The presenters simply read their sides and gave no in-depth teaching or helpful insight on logic, and 90% of their material was taken from comics like The Far Side. I saw nothing creative, original or instructive in this DVD. Save your money.",1229472000,10,300,4.679245283018868
8203106,3,B000RY79YE,"I purchased this video for my children after reading the ""Fallacy detective"" with my ten year old.  The video is broken into two 50-minute segments.  The first part went into detecting propaganda and fallacies in our every day television viewing, reasoning errors, book recommendations and a short Q&A.  The second video demonstrates how to filter opposing viewpoints, validate false science and critical scientific thinking.  The material itself was the high point of the film.

Now onto the other side of the coin...as another reviewer pointed out, this is a video of two presenters with a PowerPoint.  If you go to the thinking toolbox web page, you will find a preview of the video.  I really wish the quality and delivery were a little more engaging.  My ten year old is a rather critical thinker for her age, but this video just did not hold her attention.  The video was geared toward the younger learner, but I found it was not very engaging for the target audience.

I read other reviews that pointed out the use of the comics without pictures and thought it would not be that big of a deal.  However, once I watched the video, I realized that they used many comic strips as illustrations.  I am sure if this were viewable, my child would have been a little more intrigued.  If you still want to purchase the video, I would first watch the web stream of the video from the thinking toolbox website, prior to making the purchase.  I would give the video and presentation (since it was geared towards children) a 1, and the material content a 5, leaving my total vote at three stars.",1217548800,27,1590,4.652329749103942
