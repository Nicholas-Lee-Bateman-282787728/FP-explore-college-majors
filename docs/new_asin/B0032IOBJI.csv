There really wasn't that much product placement given the premise.  The most prominently featured relatively current product was arguably the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lionel-Wild-West-Set/dp/B000NVGLTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lionel Wild West Set</a>, but nobody could accuse Lionel of rubbing our noses in it (unlike some other toy companies I could name!).  Of course the Lionel name and Big L are practically everywhere, but virtually the entire cast are Lionel employees or their families, and the story revolves around a Lionel technological breakthrough gone horribly wrong (again, a very surprising and rather gutsy premise for a toy company movie).

Even the technological breakthrough in question starts out sounding almost plausible and exactly the sort of thing that would interest the most sophisticated (and wealthy) model train enthusiasts.  Essentially Dr. Z. W. and the parents of Nancy and Bobby Pullmor have developed a way for enthusiasts to make their model railroad layouts into virtual reality worlds.  However, there are a couple of problems.  The first is that some thieves with inside help are attempting to steal the breakthrough; the second is that the breakthrough turns out to be more advanced than originally thought,...

a LOT more advanced!

Defects?  Frankly, the computer generated animation was nothing to shout about, and I noticed a few things that made little sense (A US criminal court banning someone for life?  On what authority?)  However, the biggest defect, as almost every other reviewer has noted, is the lack of an ending.  I can understand Lionel contemplating setting additional movies in this alternate universe; I cannot understand Lionel spreading a single movie out over two (or MORE?) DVD's, much worse spreading the releases out over two or more YEARS!

With no indications of the second DVD in sight, purchase&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lionelville-Destination-Adventure/dp/B0035LQEWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lionelville Destination: Adventure</a>&nbsp;and show it to your children at your peril.",1297900800,2,2296,6.0030674846625764
4059085,5,B0032IOBJI,"Lionelville: Destination Adventure provoked a mixed response in me. As a putative adult, I'm probably not the target audience - but as someone who grew up with Lionel Trains, I still found quite a bit to watch.

The big element in toy trains is fantasy. It's about creating a world and using imagination to make it real. It's something that both the young and the not so young can enjoy at many levels - and many do. Part of the magic of Lionel Trains is the way they can give families an activity that can be shared across generations.

Another part of the magic is how railroads have shaped American history - and how Lionel makes it possible to hold that history in one's hand. Lionel has always worked to sell that dream, what with brightly illustrated catalogs, action accessories, tie-ins to popular culture, legendary store displays at the holidays - whatever works. This DVD is the latest effort towards that end.

The story is this: Dr. ZW is a scientist/inventor who has done amazing things with Lionel Trains over the years. He now has a brilliant assistant who is pushing the frontiers of physics; his work has implications that go far beyond toy trains. ZW is determined to unveil it with a giant holiday layout at a great train station loosely modeled on Grand Central. A combination of industrial espionage, hubris, and chance results in the opening of a dimensional rift that sucks in toy trains, inventors, and a couple of bad guys.  Dr. ZW is discredited, his assistant and the assistant's wife are missing, and their two children are left behind with their grandfather and a mystery.

Eight years later the children and their grandfather, troubled by recurring dreams, determine it's time to go back to the abandoned Lionel factory where it all started to find some answers. They find a chastened Dr. ZW who has been working in secret to unravel just what happened - and may have built a way to rescue the missing. But when the bad guys show up again to seize his work, they're forced to take a leap into the unknown - at Full Throttle. They find themselves in an alternate dimension where reality is a full size Lionelville, complete with trains, 3 rail track, stations, and scenery. A quest begins to find the missing parents, understand what happened and find a way back... with the bad guys not far behind. Which is where the story ends for now, promising a sequel!

At one level this DVD is an extended commercial. The Lionel name and logos are all over the screen. Long time fans of Lionel will recognize iconic trains from the past. There are nods to Lionel history all through the story. But, considering the story begins with Dr. ZW getting ready to unveil incredible new technology with an amazing giant holiday layout showing off Lionel trains - it's difficult to complain about product placement. Relax and enjoy it - because while it is inevitable, it came across to me at least that it was being done with respect. The Lionel legacy goes back decades, and the people who signed off on this movie seem to be aware of the dangers of exploiting it too blatantly.

The entire movie is computer generated imagery. It's not leading edge, but it's acceptable - and it's kind of a kick to see classic Lionel trains and trackside items realized as though they were full-size prototypes. The characters and the story have a certain amount of cliche level content, but there are indications that there's potential to transcend it. And, there's the fun for a long time Lionel fan of seeing a CGI Lionel world - now that the technology is there. Plus, if you have Lionel trains and young children, this is a movie you can all enjoy together.

WILL there be a sequel? I don't know, but based on what I've seen so far, I think I wouldn't mind booking a return trip to Lionelville.",1266710400,7,3798,4.6413690476190474

8387499,3,B0032IOBJI,"Fair Warning!

This is a great concept and pretty well executed. Only one problem...... it leaves you hanging. This video has been out long enough that, if there was going to be another segment of this continuing story, it would have been released by now. Checking out Lionel's website, I found no indication that any further episodes were in the works at this time.

Therefore, unless you are OK with getting only a portion of a story and then moving on, you won't like being left hanging in perpetuity. If the person at Lionel responsible for starting this endeavor is unable to move it forward, Lionel should hire an outside firm to continue the story to completion.

Something about ""Counting the cost"" - right?",1357084800,4,715,4.75
