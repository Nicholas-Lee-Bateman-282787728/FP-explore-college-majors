7938152,3,B00005I9P0,"In his TV documentary 'The Conquistadors', British historian Michael Wood focuses on the conquest and successes of an idealistic Spanish invasion under Hernando Cortes. His story is one of conquest, heroism and greed.
 With the necessity to entertain, Wood's documentary focuses as much on his personal journey as the Spanish conquest itself. Wood opens his documentary with a focus on money and warriors. He adopts a traditional history approach and concentrates on the conflict between two `great' men, Montezuma and Cortes.
 Wood's history presents a dramatised and even glorified perspective of the conquistadors. Wood believes Cortes was the ""hero"", ""the gambler that gambled everything and won"". The theatrical influence in his history is epitomised by the continual suspenseful and emotive music that creates an entertaining story, but unreasonable history. Wood clearly overdramatises his history when labelling the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan as the ""jaws of hell"".
 Ultimately, his history is invalidated by his suppression of the Spaniard's ruthlessness, and their introduction of Catholicism and numerous diseases, as he rather focuses on the conflict of great men. Whilst this creates an entertaining narrative, Wood is subsequently anaesthetising truth regarding the Spaniard's brutality. In doing so, Wood is contradicting Las Cases' The Black Legend, which continually accuses the Spaniard's of unreasonable treatment towards the natives, making no distinction in their slaughter regarding gender or age.
 As a documentry, however, Wood creates an interesting adventure as he simulates the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, with visits to archaeological sites that add a depth of validity to the story he is retelling.",1068249600,8,1734,5.709302325581396
7938153,4,B00005I9P0,"Let it be said that I love documentaries. Many of my friends roll their eyes and shake their heads . . . but I still love 'em. The topic of Conquistadors summoned up romantic images of my California history classes in 4th and 5th grade as I grew up in LA. I went ahead and made the purchase. At first, I was a bit put off by the style of documentary. I was more used to the traditional style of documentary in which images and photos from history are accompanied by the narrator's voiceover interspliced with that of knowledgable historians.
Mr. Wood however, takes you on a journey and the majority of his images are from modern times shot ""in the footsteps"" of the Conquistadors he is profiling. At first I was dissapointed, but eventually, this ""genre"" of documentary grabbed me and I began to really enjoy it. The final installment on Cabesa de Vaca is simply amazing and worth the price in and of itself.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the videos. Not my favorite . . . but definitely worth it.",1001548800,13,999,4.489010989010989
7938154,5,B00005I9P0,"Michael Wood has done it again. After his Alexander the Great (also highly recommendable) he came up with this fascinating account of the conquest of the New World. The video as well as the book are concise and highly informative. The video was almost like a movie. It resembled a thriller that you do not want to leave as you fear to miss something.
For me as a European it was extremely interesting and a ""must buy"". For Americans it should be a MUST. You will not regret to buy this excellent documentary.
Let us hope Michael Wood produces something else soon.",999820800,6,563,4.529411764705882
7938155,5,B00005I9P0,"This was a fabulous take on the main stream Conquistadors, better than a lot of points by the Learning Channel version ""The Conquistadors""  Michael Wood's verbal descriptions were intense and informative.  His exploration to the MODERN sites actually made the history more real!  I would have liked to have seen a blend of Mr. Wood with the Learning Channel version with the reenactors.  This video is one I will watch over and over.",999648000,5,433,4.890410958904109
