8233572,4,B000LXGVJU,"The Living Landscape series are beautifully photographed with moving images as opposed to some DVDs of a similar nature that use only still photographs!

The High Definition picture quality is superb in widescreen anamorphic 16x9 format and on a front DLP projector you become immersed into each scene.  Be warned:  if you are feeling tired when you view these glorious scenescapes you'll likely nod off because they are just so relaxing.  The music and natural sound effects are also appropriate for each of the sequences in DD 5.1.",1179360000,3,533,5.0227272727272725
