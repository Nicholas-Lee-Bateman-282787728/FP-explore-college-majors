913984,5,6304612796,"Put aside all predisposed ideas about Lexx doubting space travelers and journey to a new universe where nothing in it can compare to anything previously known.  Keep your imagination open in this new world.  As with anything new it will be strange and a bit scary.  Let the complex characters and storyline of ""I Worship His Shadow"" draw you deeper into this new galaxy and provide your adventure with many directions in which to turn.  Don't let doubts deny you this voyage into a paralle world of fantasy and fun. True, this is a Lexx movie, and those of us who love these movies and the series think it a great introduction.  But if you truly love science fiction, you won't give up an opportunity to see other worlds regardless of who's universe it is.",990662400,2,756,4.57037037037037
913985,3,6304612796,"In a distant future, mankind has been subjugated by the evil order of ""His Divine Shadow"".  Ruling from his capitol on the the ""cluster"", Shadow ceaselessly regenerates himself by passing his essence onto other members of the ""Divine Order"".  The brains of prior hosts are preserved as well, becoming the honored predecessors, all laboring to construct the Lexx, a doomsday engine powerful enough to eradicate worlds.  His Divine Shadow has only one fear - extermination at the hands of the Bruneen-G, a noble race of poets driven almost to extinction in past millenia by an earlier incarnation of His Shadow.  Eager to surmount the prophecy that tells of his end at the hands of the Brunnen-G, His Shadow reanimates the corpse of the last of its warriors, Kai, forcing him to become an assassin for the Divine Order, as if to disprove the prophecy and any imagined threat to his Shadow's existence.
Things go wrong when rebels attack the cluster with the intention of stealing the Lexx, which resembles a large wingless Dragongly, with appropriately organic interior.  The attack disrupts the planned termination of a lower-class buraucrat, Stanley Tweedle who, despite his seeming insignificance (and due to his weakness of charachter) has much to do with His Shadow's dominance over much of the universe.  (Suffice it to say that he's known to much of humanity as ""Arch Traitor-Stanly Tweedle"").  Given the key to the Lexx (by accident), Stan's joined by Xev, a once unattractive woman morphed into a beautiful, if fearsome woman, and 790 - an android head in love with Xev once he receives the sexual conditioning that was intended for her.  Kai, sent to stop them, suddenly experiences total recall.  He's still only an animated corpse, but with memories of himself as a warrior against his shadow...and the prophecy.  With the Divine Order hot on their tails, Tweedle and comapny head for the fractal zone, the gateway into a parrallel universe through which his Shadow cannot follow.
Given that plot, it's incredible how unoriginal this story really is.  A bunch of outcasts of a fascist order take refuge (and rebel) with the help of a super-starship (Blake's 7); One of the main charachters is a lovable coward who duels ceaselessly with a robot (Lost in Space); His Shadow's essence passes from body to body, constantly outliving his hosts (an idea already old when used in Dark Horse's Star Wars, Dark Empire).  The creators don't so much as develop a story as put a new spin on old sci-fi cliches (mostly overt sexual references), while the special effects look like 1st generation CGI.
Still, despite myself, I had a ball - Kai is appropriately morose, but can manage a sly sense of humor.  Stanley is perfect as a coward, and the writers no better than to try and make him sympathetic.  Xev, for her sexual magnetism seems a perfectly victorian figure - if only because Stan's desire for her clouds his sense of self-preservation.  It's a lot of fun as long as you don't try to take it too seriously.",982454400,6,3014,4.870841487279844
913986,1,6304612796,"I write this review, not to belittle those who like Lexx, but simply to warn others not to watch what I believe to be one of the worst sci-phi films ever made.  I can only imagine what an ""ordinary"", non psi-phi viewer must think of this mess.  I don't even know what provoked me to keep watching it - hope that it may change for the better perhaps.  Unfortunately though, it didn't.  Poor acting, laughable dialogue and a thoroughly ludicrous plot contribute to an absolute shamble of a film.  About the only positive thing I can say is that it conjured up a fraction of interest when introducing the idea of the Shadow, but even that enthusiasm was quickly ebbed out by extremely amateur plot handling.  I just can't help but wonder how anyone was given financial backing to produce such a sure fire disaster.",981590400,,811,4.558620689655172
913987,5,6304612796,"If you have been rivited to the TV watching series 2, I highly recomend this movie episode. It, being the first fills in all the blanks and answers questions that you must have been asking yourself. How did Zev/Xev become a love slave and why? How did Stanley Tweedle become tha captain of the Lexx? ( A BIG Bug) How did 790 lose his body and how did he get brainwashed? AND just what is this handsome assassin's history and why is he alive-dead? You will be riveted to your seat for 98 mins. The Uk/Australian version is unedited so you get the full effect. A bit of Gore, nudity (a bit) and a lot of action. Get this video!!",981590400,5,626,4.225
913988,5,6304612796,"The fact that you are reading this probably means you are into sci-fi... Well, then, this is sci-fi for adults -deeply negative, amazingly imaginative, enriched with black humour and vague sex -what more can you ask for?
The space battle which opens the film is the ultimate flying war scene, faster and more absorbing than anything else I have watched of its type. Listen carefully to all the dialogues, they contain the fun and are worth it.
Yes, the film has a few serious flaws, but its freedom, personality and surprisingly biological inclination more than make up for it. And that's even without counting Eva Habermann at 19! If you appreciate blue eyes and miniskirts she will drive you potty for ever.",980035200,3,709,4.819672131147541

913990,5,6304612796,"I first saw this movie, and the subsequent three ""Tales"" movies: Eating Pattern, Supernova and Giga Shadow - after watching Lexx religiously  for several months on SciFi. It not only was great to see the real origins  of the most adorably dysfunctional space crew to ever grace a scifi movie -  you can see in this video the beginnings of an epic. The Lexx is, without a  doubt, the most endearing space ship - just listen to his/its self-intro at  the beginning of each movie. An added bonus is Marty Simon's excellent  score to all 4 movies and all the shows. This video, the other 3 Lexx  movies and the TV episode ""Brigadoom"" are must haves for any  self-respecting sci-fi or fantasy fan!",966211200,8,692,4.569105691056911

7876047,5,6304612796,"At first glance, I didn't think I would like this series. In fact, I saw the second one first (the one with Tim Curry) and turned it off in the middle. But then, I came back to it, and the bug had bit me, and I had to see what the rest of the series was like.
The first one is very dark, depressing, and satiracly funny. Reminiscent of Stanislaw Lem, it has holocaust themes, gore, weird political structures, etc. I cannot eat anything (not even popcorn) while watching these shows--the emphasis on death, mutilation, dehumanizing (""meat""), and defecation are overwhelming at first, but then the humor crept through. The music grew on me as well. And me, being a graphic designer, liked all the computer animation as well. But really, the acting is superb (MUCH better than Star Wars: the Clone Wars--though that's not saying much), the plot interesting, and the twists of fate ironic. This was the pilot, and one of the best in this series, quite necessary, as it sets everything up to follow.",1040169600,,995,4.627118644067797

7876050,4,6304612796,"This movie was a good starting point for the series, as well as a great start for the mini-series within the series itself. You must really be able to know what is going on in this movie especially in order to know what is going on in the main series, because this tells how all of the characters who ended up on the LEXX found their way there. For those of you who aren't familiar with the story: Stanley Tweedle is the self-proclaimed king of the cowards and smartasses who must donate several body parts or die. He takes neither and finds himself on the run. Zev is an ugly cow who insults a prince on their wedding day, so she is sentenced to have her body changed into a lustfully beautiful sex slave. Trouble is she got only half of the alteration and had a part of a cluster lizard embedded into her DNA.A robot's head got the second part of the alteration, the bit where she falls in love with the first person she sees. Of course, Zev was the first person it saw. The final person of our crew was Kai, the last warrior of a once proud race who has become an agent of death for the Shadow. Oh yeah, he's been dead for a thousand years. There are a few hitchikers on the ship, a beastly savage woman who lives on human flesh, and the brains of the last several dozen shadows.

7876053,5,6304612796,"Lexx is without a doubt the oddest and coolest thing on television.  Both in turns smart and sexy, clever and full of invention.  This video is the first in a series of movies that launched Lexx onto an unsuspecting public.  All I can say about it is this:  Thank goodness this movie exists!!  I am a rather late convert to the world of Lexx and have always found the show to be both excellant and frustrating.  However I Worship His Shadow has finally laid to rest any and all of the questions I had about this series and it's done it in style too.  This is top of the line, masterful dark sci-fi.  Highly recommended.  You must see this if you like inventive and original science fiction.",1010707200,,690,4.3700787401574805

7876055,5,6304612796,"if you like Shakespeare and opera, you'll love this.  not only does it cater to the panting 13-35 american male category (sex and violence and fabulous special effects), but it is loaded with a dark extremely cynical look at the human race. it is a dim reflection of the brilliant director tim burton's take on humanity, only completely without any sympathy or redemptive attribution to being human whatsoever.  its funny and its 'disturbing' (such an overused word in the ott decade, but very very appropriate for lexx), not because of the sex, violence or severely disfunctional 'heroes' but because how every human being on the series ends up being totally empty of any useful reason to exist. if very very clever people wanted to take Star Wars and turn every single wonderful feeling and archtype of hero in that movie into a total intellectually reversed universe of the meanings about being human, Lexx is it.  and they even accomplished using the old classic Disney movie trick where whatever level you are at in being entertained, the movie is great to see, unless you are a member of one of the dogmatic and seriously single issue minded class of being human lately taking over all the talking head america.
the original four tv movies are the best, but the series is slowly losing excitement.  the characters and what they represent artistically never change, except for the dead hero, who seems to be solidifying into a statue.  the assassin is becoming so bloodless that at this point if he disappeared from the series no one would miss him for at least several episodes. after wonderfully clever slamming every aspect of humanity and all historic artistic endeavors to show humanity at its best, the show is turning sterile.  even the artistic tension of having the characters possibly die from their adventures has been bled into losing all caring about it.  it appears that where such a black view of everything in the universe leads is to complete meaningless or caring about anything, including being interested to tune in next week.  i don't know if the creators have lost interest in taking the original sarcastic themes any further or if the ideas of so much utter meaningless to life has left them feeling creatively sterile.
in any case, the first 4 movies are wonderful, stimulating and fun, and leave you wondering, gosh, what next?  i only wish that the story hadn't led to this dead end.  it seems to me they could have kept the original hints in these movies of some type of satisfying climaxes for the characters, yet retain the sarcastic attitude.  i think the creators fell so in love with the idea of trashing human idealism and hopes for the future they lost sight of the idea of how humans make life interesting when it gets dull and played out. if every human killed themselves when they ran out of ideas on what to do tomorrow, well, you know how this ends.",996105600,2,2893,4.754491017964072
7876056,5,6304612796,"This is a great Sci-Fi movie. It has great caracters, cool space ships, cool costumes, and a great story line. I highly recommend this movie and the rest of the LEXX series.
