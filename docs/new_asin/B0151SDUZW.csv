8732323,3,B0151SDUZW,"Exercises were at the end of the lecture. No way to jump to it on the dvd without fast forward the entire lecture. The lecture seemed to explain his book, so I did not buy the book. Sound was low in some parts. Exercises were maybe 15 minutes of the video. Stretch before doing it or could have sore lower back. The exercises did help me heal overtime. After a 15 minute shake, I felt really relaxed and calm as if I had an hour massage. I did it 2-3 times per week for 15-20 minutes in first 4 months, then 1-2 times per week for 8 months. Noticed a difference in my well being after a couple of months. Also did yoga & meditation to heal from trauma. After 1 year, I am an entirely new, happy, healthy person. TRE works!",1522022400,,722,4.091549295774648
8732324,5,B0151SDUZW,"I am SO pleased that I finally bought this newer DVD release about David Berceli's  TRE process.  I arrived yesterday but this morning was my first exposure to the program.  It is about 45 minutes long and I could tell as David narrated the basic understanding behind the exercises that I was going to benefit from using this program.  If you buy this video program you will be presented with a short lecture type introduction about how the exercises help you physically followed by the segment where Bercelli demonstrates the warm up exercises with a model.  Berceli has created the ultimate video tutorial for this fascinating health practice.  I purchased his other DVD in 2011 and while it was helpful this DVD contains only the information about the practice itself - no philosophy no historical tours no discussion and no references to his years teaching this method to groups all over the world.  It is focused, concise, and tells the viewer the basics of what he or she needs to know in order to get started practicing this at home on his or her own.  In short  this DVD simply teaches and he has done an excellent job.  After floundering for six years to understand the mechanics of TRE and how to benefit from using at a private personal practice I now have the understanding I need without having to filter out any extra information that does not relate to what I am trying to learn.  One other fact about this program is Berceli clearly describes the foundation instructions and concisely repeats aspects of the practice that you need to keep in mind at all times when practicing.  Also this DVD is being sold at a decreased price compared with the one I purchased in 2011.  Some people like me find it difficult to get to workshops or out of town events such as those about TRE as much as we would like to go - so we try to learn it on our own.  This DVD will help anyone who is in a similar situation get started in a way that is likely to produce beneficial results.  It is focused and the material is presented in a clear non technical way which I appreciate so much.  TY Amazon for offering this product.  TY David Berceli for this DVD.",1506124800,14,2153,4.493573264781491

8732329,5,B0151SDUZW,"This DVD is a companion to David's newest book (of the same title, released in 2015). It is the first DVD instructional video update since David's 2008 DVD.  What's on this DVD are basically two things: (1) David talks about the theory of TRE  (2) David demonstrates the TRE exercises.  If you want to know how to actually do TRE on your own, this is the DVD you want to watch. In the video, David teaches the TRE exercises to Jonas Nordstrom, and you can follow along in real time.

TRE is a profoundly effective way to recover from trauma. TRE uses the nervous system's built-in way of discharging the so-called fight/flight/freeze response that gets activated during stress and trauma.  I've personally found TRE to be very effective in bringing me to full recovery from early childhood trauma.  Some day, as this becomes more well known, it will revolutionize the treatment of trauma & stress.",1451606400,37,897,4.754838709677419
