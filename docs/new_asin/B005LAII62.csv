4778992,5,B005LAII62,"While maintaining a steady sense of humor from beginning to end ParaNorman is a many layered, very profound movie, that, quite frankly, is a masterpiece! The only movie this year, as of August 2012, that I will purchase to add to my film collection! Towards the end of ParaNorman, it was so moving tears were coming to my eyes! What an incredibly pleasant surprise!

I have to admit that I was concerned that ParaNorman would lead to insulting or trivializing the Wiccan/Pagan/Spiritualist/Paranormal community! But just the opposite happened! If you are Pro Healing, Pro Courage, Pro Forgiveness, Pro Spiritual, Pro Witch, Pro Gay, and Pro Paranormal, like I am, then make sure you see this film before it leaves the theaters. Films this good don't usually last in mainstream theaters for very long. For example, the only other great film that I've seen this year -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beasts-of-the-Southern-Wild/dp/B008220AGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a>&nbsp;has been showing only on single screen in the Baltimore City & County, an area of over a million people!

Thank you Hollywood for sticking your neck out by making a movie for grown-ups, while at the same time making a film you can take the entire family to see!

4778993,4,B005LAII62,"Writer and Co-Director Chris Butler (storyboardist on Coraline and Corpse Bride) has given us a unique vision of a common situation in this 3D Stop-Motion animation film. Judging people can cause you to make bad decisions -because not learning the truth and fearing what you don't know can be harmful. How?

 Butler says, ""I wanted to do a story where there are no real bad guys, just characters making bad decisions based on their own personal fears."" His Co-Director Sam Fell (Flushed Away, The Tale of Despereaux) also says, ""This film is about real characters in an extraordinary situations. We all know of the everyday bully that you fear more than monsters in a scary movie or in your closet!""

Focus features production, released under the Universal Pictures distribution, of Paranorman is a story about a very special boy who has the ability to talk to ghosts of the deceased who have certain `business' yet to finish before they move on. This makes him odd and different to both his family and his classmates. What he learns in the end, as everyone in the town does, is that nothing is what it appears to be. And making decisions, without giving someone a chance or learning about them, can lead you to make bad and sometimes `deadly' decisions.

 The story has a few slow points, but there is great humor between the two buddies Norman, voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In, The Road) and his overweight buddy Neil, voiced by Tucker Albrizzi (Mike & Molly, Brothers & Sisters). Some of the most hysterical commentary comes from Norman's sister Courtney, voiced by Anna Kendrick (Twilight, Up In the Air). Now add your bully/blockhead character named Alvin, voiced by Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, How To Train Your Dragon) and you have your typical neighborhood gang! There's even a `Jock' with a twist (at the end) named Mitch, brother of Neil, voiced by Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone, Good Will Hunting).

 Norman has his work cut out for himself because he is dealing with a curse from a 300-year-old witch placed on Norman's town. And this witch, who turns out to be exactly something you would never expect - a miss judged little girl - has a surprise of her own. She is voiced perfectly by Jodelle Ferland (Stargate, Seed).

 The movie also has such great talents as John Goodman (The Artist, Monster's Inc.) as a `ghostly' crazy uncle; Elaine Stritch (30 Rock, Monster-In-Law) as a `ghostly' grandma with a big heart; Bernard Hill (Titanic, Lord of the Rings) as a regretful `ghostly' Judge from 300 years ago; and Tempestt Bledsoe (The Cosby Show, Dance Till Dawn) as an irreverent but determined police officer - who is not a ghost!

Norman's parents, a very supportive mother Sarah voiced by Leslie Mann (17 Again, Knocked Up), and a not so supportive father Perry voiced by Jeff Garlin (Wall*E, Curb Your Enthusiasm), confuse Norman more than help him.

 The film is extremely colorful and creative in production design done by the artistic vision of Nelson Lowry (Fantastic Mr. Fox). The stop-motion animation is fluid and fun and the ultimate in greatly detailed set construction and props, including some inside jokes. Look at the brand name of the underwear of Mitch the `Jock' brother of Neil is wearing.

 This movie is funny and has some great scenes between the family members and a visually stunning confrontation with ""The Witch"" and Norman that ends with an heart-warming resolution of compassion and respect. As the director, Chris also states, ""I hope people see this film as a fun family adventure....it might not be so scary to the young ones because it's your basic kid vs. bully situation. Except here everyone wins!"" Good fun for everyone!",1345852800,7,3685,4.865814696485623
4778994,4,B005LAII62,"Paranorman is a movie about a boy who can see ghosts and this leads to him being considerered a freak and an outcast in his hometown. However, he starts to have visions about diaster to his town, and this comes at the time of the 300th anniversary of the murder of a 'witch' and her curse. Norman's crazy uncle has been doing a ritual for many years to keep the curse and witch contained.

Unfortunately, he dies leaving the task to Norman and due to misinterpretation and lack of reliabel info, he ends up missing the deadline causing zombies to rise.

The thing I would compliment the movie on the most is characterization. It is good at the show, don't tell rule. You can tell so much about Norman just by how the world interacts toward and the enviroment. This is this wonderful shot of Norman ,at the beginning, when he is just walking along a dessert street adn talking to (what appears) to be no one. At school we get how his peers think of him when we see 'freak' has been written on his locker. He casually takes out cleaning supplies, this scene tells us that this happens often.

We also have good characterization of the side characters as well. Although they mainly stick to stereotypes like Courtney, the self-centered teen girl and the dumb jock. His best friend ,Neal, comes off as instantly likable and a lovable character.

The stop-motion is done in a realistic, yet still cartoon-like fashion. This movie needs praise for it's use of enviroments to create wonderful atmosphere. The graveyard is a wonderful isolated and spooky location. The final 'battle' is also a wonderful set that fits the mood perfectly.

The most I think kids and adults will take away from this is that it is okay to be different and even if the world feels like it is a against you, there are still people there for you. I think that is a good message for everyone.

I will wanr conservative/Republican parents that this movie has a gay character in it. Though you do not think out till the end. I am not against this, in fact I praise it. I just do not want to hear complaints/lower starts because of that.

I do not see this movie as scaring children, simply because the zombies are just too silly.

All in all, a good family movie",1345248000,12,2228,4.497524752475248
4778995,5,B005LAII62,"""Coraline"" was amazing. Even though its box office success wasn't nearly as impressive as it should have been and you rarely hear anyone bring it up whenever conversations turn to animated films, ""Coraline"" catered to both children and adults. It had this extremely dark undertone; children were having their eyes replaced with buttons. That's so gloriously morbid for a children's flick. There was also mild cursing, a creepy alternate world where everyone had a mirror self (with button eyes, of course), and a woman with a massive chest that was only covered by sea shells in one particular scene. It was just so unusual and extraordinary. Laika Entertainment, the studio behind ""Coraline,"" has brought us ""ParaNorman,"" which is certainly in the same vein and travels a similar path to greatness.

""ParaNorman"" is a stop-motion animated film that revolves around Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee); a young boy who can talk to dead people and is ridiculed because of it. Even his family doesn't believe in his gift, especially his dad Perry (Jeff Garlin) who refuses to think outside the box and gets angry at things he doesn't understand. Norman is picked on everyday by a thick-headed bully named Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and is mostly a loner until he gets to know a red headed boy named Neil (Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied just as much as Norman but has learned to turn the other cheek.

A strange man named Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) claims to share Norman's gift and under a strange set of circumstances passes the duty of keeping the witch's curse at bay for another year to Norman. Now in a race against time, Norman finds himself with a group of unlikely allies including Neil's meathead brother Mitch (Casey Affleck) and Norman's ditzy sister Courtney (Anna Kendrick) as he tries to save the town from uncertain doom and a zombie takeover.

""ParaNorman"" treads a thin line between something that's appropriate for the whole family and only being suitable for a teenage or more mature audience, but if you didn't have a problem with the content in ""Rango"" or ""Coraline"" then it shouldn't be much of a problem here. The word ""hell"" is used more than once and Norman's grandma calls Perry a ""jackass"" at one point. It hints at more mature themes, as well. Perry calls Norman's gift ""limp wristed hippy garbage"" and a certain male character mentions having a boyfriend late in the film. Norman's sister Courtney is very gifted in the posterior region and there are many jokes that make use of that or could be considered innuendo. It's kind of glorious, really. Fans of animation will be in heaven.

There's obviously a big horror influence, as well; particularly classic zombie films, ""Halloween,"" and ""Friday the 13th."" So the film not only caters to animation fans, but also horror hounds. There are a ton of throwbacks, jokes about brains, and zombies with flesh hanging from their decayed bones. The imagery is just as exceptional; intimidating houses, gloomy forests, and a heavy use of shadows and lack of lighting. ""ParaNorman"" is just the right amount of homage, humor, and animation.

""ParaNorman"" isn't quite as original or as dark as ""Coraline,"" but it's still extremely entertaining for most ages and one of the best animated films of the year. The emphasis on witchcraft results in a rather peculiar final act, but is still very enjoyable. ""ParaNorman"" is brilliantly animated with an amazing cast and clever writing. It's the animated film horror fans have been waiting for and the one ""Frankenweenie"" is probably aiming to be.

There's a brief scene after the credits that's really interesting; you see how the model for Norman was made along with how much detail goes into a stop-motion animated picture.",1345248000,69,3746,4.966507177033493
4778996,5,B005LAII62,"This new 3D stop-motion from animation is Impressive, Amusing, and Quirky. A delightful summer movie for the entire family. The eerie, whimsical story portrays that you don't become a hero by being normal, and begins in a small town that is under siege by zombies. Who can it call? Of course, the misunderstood local boy is called upon. Norman, who can speak with the dead, has to face challenges as he takes on much more than zombies. He must face ghosts, witches, and the grown-ups, to save the town from a centuries-old-curse. But, his paranormal activities may be pushed to the limits.

Or what about Pinocchio, Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and all the other frightening and murderous movies made by Diseny. But If It's not Disney God forbid it be more mature. Hell, look at the kids live action movies of the 80s, they were just as mature as this and we grew up fine watching them. I miss the old days when a kid's movie was real instead of this watered down garbage they make today. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Your child sees and hears much worse at school.

4780530,4,B005LAII62,"If this flick had a more neutral or less-saturated color palette youd swear it was a Tim Burton film.  It has the feel, but it also has more heart.  Moms and dads, if you don't want your kids to watch Plimpton-esque stop-motion characters who think and act like denizens from a shunned Tennessee backwater burg straight out of the 90s who have to fight the fumbling frightened dead (who just want to rest dontcha know?) because you think thisll scare your kids you probably don't have a lot to worry about.  You may take offense to the undertones of how past people of devout faith but with stern practices are portrayed though in our largely irreligious and religiously ignorant culture this won't likely bother that many.  The baddie in the film is a little (dead) girl lost, one who has suffered and is angry and doesnt want to forgive, and the film seems to mine some of the J-horror phenomena in this respect while wrapping it up in a thoroughly American blanket.  But the heart of the movie is the friendship and support that Norman, an outcast kid who sees dead people, receives from his rotund but good-natured cant-keep-him-down friend Neil.  Their kindness and sympathy toward each other plays naturally, much like the relationships that were between the kid protagonists in the excellent Monster House.  All of the characters are ultimately treated with sympathy (including the zombies) and theres a decent amount of heart included amidst all of the quirk, and goo, and boo!  Worth a watch.  4.5 stars.",1460160000,,1513,4.8108108108108105

There's just enough legitimate scares, sexual innuendo, and deep subject matter to exclude little kids.

The artwork is so well-done. If this wasn't an animated film, I'm sure I would have closed my eyes a few times like I do while watching The Walking Dead with my son. This isn't a movie I would let my great-niece and great-nephew watch. At ages six and four, they are too young for the dark, creepy content. How people act when controlled by fear - this is what stood out most.

It is a constant challenge to find movies that are interesting for both a child and an adult.  This one is.  It had a good story, just the right amount of scare for her, but would probably be too scary for most normal 7-year-old kids.  We ended up buying it because she loved it so much.  It has a good story - underneath all the paranormal stuff is a very thoughtful plot line about being yourself without worrying about what other people think.  At 7 she is already dealing with ""mean girls,"" and I think this movie was another step in her understanding she should let her freak flag fly, and have more confidence when dealing with those types of kids.",1431388800,2,757,4.364285714285714

4781592,4,B005LAII62,"The studio Laika has made a name for itself with stop-motion movies with a creepy edge. In this one, a young boy in a small town sees ghosts and regularly talks with them. He is rejected by most of his peers and estranged from his own family. Soon his uncle comes along and warns him of a witchs centuries-old curse.

The animation is as smooth as possible for stop-motion puppets. It is downright lively, in fact. Everything is beautifully constructed and detailed. There is a number of fairly typical but still entertaining characters. The story actually takes a seriously emotional turn in the third sectionhere I should only say that its far from a typical zombie apocalypse. Early on even a very intelligent child can see that this is a story about the need to overcome fear and the need to for acceptance of those with different giftsit does nearly become preachy, but its still affecting.",1424736000,2,895,4.737179487179487

4781981,4,B005LAII62,"Wildly creative and technically terrific, there is much to admire in this animated play on traditional zombie films.  But unlike Coraline  made by some of the same people  or the other Tim Burton/Henry Selick macabre animated works, theres a certain lack of soul and emotion here that keeps it from climbing to the heights of those films.

Theres also an odd unevenness of tone.  While it has a few really inspired visual and verbal gags, it switches a bit awkwardly back and forth between being almost over-earnest, and a kind of hip, ironic distanced humor.  And much of the plot feels familiar and/or predictable.

Part of the struggle for me as an adult is that this is really made for tweens.  Too scary for little kids, it also limits the film a bit on the older side.  It cant work as easily for adults as some kids films (ala Pixar, etc), where 8 years olds can enjoy it while 30 or 40 year olds can get it on a whole different level.  I bet 11 year olds would flat out love this, but unlike the films mentioned earlier, I felt a bit left out of the fun.  Still, it has its moments, both of humor and heart, and Im glad I saw it.  I just don't know that Id ever go back for seconds.",1416614400,5,1190,4.263392857142857

The animation is perfect and brings that sense of fairy tale which I felt when I was a kid and watched cartoons on TV. Back then I believed in them, and this one made me believe in these characters too, and believe the story.

When I bought a 3D disk and we watched it, the sense of immersion of this story deepened dramatically. From a flat accepted-as-artificial show it became a stage in the real space - the whole movie was unfolding just right in front of us, it's like ... a mix of a puppet theater and ""small soldiers"" -kind of live action.

4782231,5,B005LAII62,"This is an animated film for adults as well as children.

The story is quirky and the animation lovely.  Norman, a ten-year-old, can see ghosts, as well as history, and this makes him a pariah in his town (a witch-haunted hamlet in Massachusetts), his school, and even his family.  The animation depicts all these people in their quirky but lovable reality: Norman is cute but has porcupine hair, wingnut ears,  and mismatched nostrils; his dad has a beer gut that makes him look pregnant with an elephant; his mom is sweet and frumpy and has a bulging 40-year-old belly; his older sister is a Barbie wannabe with never a hair out of place, smothered in lipgloss and oceans of pink.

And the morals are ones that both kids and adults can relate to.  Ostracism vs. acceptance, creativity vs. inclusion, the wisdom of children vs. the obtuseness of adults, the ability of almost anyone to change.

Norman, of course, saves the day, and the town--grudgingly and falteringly, but with increasing confidence.  And all the other characters grow quite believably from the experience.

One nice thing is how most of the characters go from being stereotypes to being multidimensional.  The premier example is Norman's sister Courtney.  She starts as a vapid teenage narcissist airhead, and, quite surprisingly, shows amazing reserves of strength, leadership, perception, and pluck before it's all over.  She's still a vapid teenage narcissist, but she's also an interesting and surprising person.

Fun for everyone.",1403049600,,1506,5.09795918367347

4782233,5,B005LAII62,"This movie is definitely a good movie. The general feel of it is that you should always have empathy even when the people you want to help are upset at your concern, always embrace your unique traits even when the world is telling you you're strange and unacceptable, and never judge someone else based off your own assumptions. The hero of the movie wasn't strong, or a genius, but he did care and he was 'weird', and in the end that is all that mattered. My son is almost 8 months, and I'm excited for when he can finally see and comprehend this movie.

Complaining about the fact that it has witches, zombies, magic, and a character who at the very end reveals he was gay the whole time are NOT good reasons to not let your kids see this movie. That kind of offensive behavior and unjustified fear was ridiculous when harry potter was released, and it's ridiculous that people still act like that. My wife had parents like that, and believe me, if you act like that to your kids it will leave scars - physical and emotional scars. By all means, teach your kids what you believe, but please don't scare, threaten, or bully them into your beliefs and don't censor the world for them. If they believe like you do, then that's good, but if they don't and you actively repress it then it will be very damaging.",1400198400,,1308,4.404958677685951

4782289,4,B005LAII62,"When I first saw this in the theatre two years ago I was very impressed with it. However, when I saw it again on DVd just now it was not so impressive. Yet I still liked it. What I most enjoyed were the scenes where Norman talked to Angry Aggie (Agatha Babcock) and she turned out to be a frightened 11 year old girl who was angry for adults murderering her centuries ago. Like so many movies, it deals with the misunderstood outsider ostracized by The Establishment. With Norman also labeled a freak by The Popular Kids, he was the only one who could save the town from the curse of the so-called witch. Both Aggie and Norman had paranormal abilities to see the dead or things from another realm or level of existence. Unfortunately all that is at the end of the film. Most of the film is too much characters running around and doing stupid things. This was probably intentional on the directors' part, but still for me it was a distraction and I wish more of the film spent time with the dialogue between Aggie and Norman, for that was the only part worth seeing. A moral for the film is the normal people acquire acceptance of the strangeness of Norman and learn better that he is special and not a freak. Because the film has only a few scenes worth watching, I only gave it four stars. Frankly I liked The Corpse Bride much better, yet I am grateful that animators make films that are a little off or odd instead of endless musical comedies.",1395446400,3,1446,4.379182156133829

4782444,4,B005LAII62,"Laika, the creators of Coraline, released this visually pleasing successor that pays real homage to 70s horror movies. This stop-motion animated film pulls in some surprisingly fantastic 3-D effects, and not like some other films that were probably just converted to 3-D instead.

 Norman is a clairvoyant young boy in a small mountain town in Massachusetts who can see and hear the spirits of the dead. His family ignore this, and his ability to talk to the dead doesn't make the butt of everyone's jokes at school. However, his ridiculed uncle who can also see the dead warns him that the town will come under a witch's curse from three hundred years ago where those who sentenced her to death will rise from the grave. Norman talks his only friend in school, the resident fat kid Neil, plus Norman's agonizing sister Courtney, and Neil's jock older brother Mitch, and the school bully Alvin who frequently torments Norman into helping him stop this zombie uprising. After trying to use a storybook his now deceased uncle warned him about to try and coax the spirit of the witch back to rest again. This fails though, and the undead rise on their small town, although the zombies are just a few number with ability to turn others into zombies, and the rest of the townsfolk react with hilarious circumstances. Norman soon realizes that the witch that caused this was really an innocent young girl from centuries ago who was sentenced to death because she to could speak to the dead. Norman manages to convince the ghost into seeking her eternal rest and not going for revenge. She concedes, and Norman is then praised by the town, and is accepted by his family for his ""gift"" too.

I was very impressed with the dark tones this movie was willing to take, and how social acceptance can shape a community, even in a small town. The animation is even more groundbreaking than what was done in Coraline by bringing the story into a larger setting with more characters to add to the mix and a larger plot.

A children's movie isn't going to have a sad ending.

The one thing that mostly stood out was a line near the end of the movie were we find out that a side kick character is gay.  Do we really need to push the gay agenda in a children's movie?

From a writer's perspective revealing that the witch was actually a young girl of Norman's age with similar abilities who had been trialled and executed for witchcraft was in many ways a good turning point for the movie. But portraying what was essentially the murder of a child in a kids movie was just so inappropriate and confronting to me. I know it's a kids movie and I'm taking it way too seriously but those were very dark themes they portrayed.

4782503,4,B005LAII62,"Strange how it used to be that computer-animated films were always a guarantee of quality. This trend seems to have petered off in recent years, with a range of mediocre studios capitalizing on the popularity of CG animation, but there is one art form that never fails to churn out top quality stories: stop-motion animation. Perhaps it's because of the pain-staking level of patience and detail that goes into each moment of screen-time: clearly the arists behind the visuals don't want to waste their time on anything other than the very best that storytellers have to offer.

""ParaNorman"" is best described as a comedy-horror, veering between the two genres with a range of funny gags and genuinely scary moments. Paying homage to B-grade horror films of the 1980s (including nods to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B003COE90S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000FC2GA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>), the film also has plenty to say about the nature of fear and the devastating impact it can have on reason and compassion. By the end credits, I was surprised at how sophisticated the story and its message was, all in a film that ostensibly meant for children.

Much like Haley Joel Osmond in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>, Norman Babcock can see dead people. Unlike Haley Joel Osmond, Norman isn't afraid of them. In fact, it's the living that makes his life difficult, whether it's fending off bullies at school or coping with his own family's refusal to believe in his special gift. Such ostracization has left him withdrawn and reclusive, but he remains a gentle soul As his grandmother's ghost tells him: it's okay to be scared - as long as it doesn't change who he is.

As it turns out, there's plenty to be afraid of.  Living in Blithe Hollow, a New England township whose tourist trade revolves around a dark history of witch trials, Norman has grown up with the story of a local witch whose curse on the Puritan judges that sentenced her to death promises that they'll one day rise on Halloween as the intruments of her revenge. That day appears to be swift-approaching, for Norman is having increasingly terrifying visions of the town's colonial past.

Not only that, but he's being followed by the only other person in town deemed more crazy than him: his Uncle Prenderghast, who warns him that he's the only one who can keep the undead from rising. Together with a motley crew composed of his best (and only) friend Neil, his ditzy  sister Courtney, her would-be boyfriend Mitch and the local bully Alvin, Norman desperately searches for a way to keep the town safe - even if it means going up against angry mobs and grisly zombies.

It's hard to talk about ""ParaNorman"" without giving away the surprise twist at its climax, one that really deserves to be watched without any spoilers. Suffice to say that it's the reason why ParaNorman is so memorable, making it far more complex than its initial dark comedy sequences would at first have you believe. Even as it pokes fun at horror movie clichs, there is a very harrowing horror story at its core...one which demonstrates the fear and intolerance is a greater evil than any witch or zombie.

With creative character designs and beautiful animation, ""ParaNorman"" is a great Halloween treat, very much in the spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo/dp/B0007939Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby Doo</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hocus-Pocus/dp/B004JMY312/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hocus Pocus</a>, not to mention other stop-motion classics such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B005ZMTYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coraline/dp/B002BWCJOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coraline</a>.

4782558,5,B005LAII62,"IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not an animated movie that should be seen by any small child. I would say age 12+ due to occasional foul language and certain situations. If your child is a preteen or teen then there should be no major problems.

I'm 28 and must say I highly enjoyed the movie! I thought the characters were perfect, the story unraveled well and at a good pace and it really kept me interested. I was dying to know how it was going to end and I must say I was satisfied by the finish.

The main plot of the story is that a schoolkid named Normon is constantly ostracized and put down by most others (from classmates to his family) because he can see and talk to ghosts. He spends a good amount of time watching scary movies and talking to his grandma (who happens to have passed away but still inhabits Norman's family's home). He goes to school and most people just don't understand where he's coming from, like, ever. He goes through the school day trying to pay attention to what happens around him but often he is distracted by ghosts that are everywhere!

What I really, really liked about the movie was the message of how someone who is sometimes very gifted can be a total outcast in life. I thought that the ending with Agatha (or how she puts it ""Aggy"") was extremely heartfelt. There are quite a few spots in the movie that will make you stop and think, ""Aww!!"".

Some of the inappropriate (at least for children) stuff that occurs is the use of words like ""jackass"", ""hell"", a schoolkid mentioning the ""adult movie store"" nearby and the same schoolkid touching Norman's older sister's butt (although it's just implied and not actually shown). Basically if you are 12 or older there probably isn't anything that will stun you too much (unless you grew up highly religious and you aren't even allowed to say stuff like ""holy cow"" or the similar).

Highly recommended!

5 stars!

P.S. My favorite characters were the chubby kid, Norman and Norman's mother.",1383004800,,1972,4.553672316384181
4782609,4,B005LAII62,"ParaNorman Bowling for Movies Score: 224.438 of 300

What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

ParaNorman - we own the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet copy (we like to have our bases covered HA!)

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
A basically normal boy in a positively ordinary small town finds himself to be un-normal and the town in a positively unordinary situation... you see Norman can see and speak with the dead.  Yup, that's right he and his shirt size are the same - a medium!  As the town readies for its 300th anniversary Norman begins to be haunted by spooky visions making him the butt of the school's jokes and an easy target for the local bully, Alvin.  Finding keeping to himself to be less complicated, Norman attempts to be a lone wolf but fortunately the other schoolyard reject, Neil (a perpetual glass-half-full kind of guy, and frankly an inspiration to just being nice fanatics everywhere) befriends him and totally accepts Norman's ""quirks"".  As the story unfolds we learn that Norman isn't the only medium in the family - his ""nutty"" weird guy uncle has the gift and a dark secret about the local legend of the much celebrated witch's curse.  It seems generations of Norman's family have been keeping the dark magic of the witch at bay.  When his uncle suddenly dies, Norman must pick up the reins and help the town (which has done nothing but ridicule and make fun of him).  Will Norman and his band of misfit friends save the town and remove the curse forever????  Buy or rent this little gem of a flick to find out!

What I loved:
~ What a wonderful blend of artistic expressions - CGI, sure, but also stop motion animation, and get this - they used an emerging technology to make the puppets - 3D printing, how cool is that?  The end product is seamless and beautiful.

~ The script was a throw-back to earlier horror flicks and has some genuinely suspenseful and scary parts (a warning to parents with very young children, this might be a little too scary for little ones - we'd watch it first if Little Movie Dude was younger just to make sure it was ok).

~ The 3D effects were well used and blended into the movie completely - I actually forgot it was in 3D as I was totally immersed into Norman's world.

~ Positive messages abound: from Neil's ever-present positive spin and can do attitude, Norman's willingness to let by-gones-be-by-gones to save his home town, Norman's mother who always is the voice of reason and a grade ""A"" peacekeeper, and a touching moment with his ghost of a grandmother who offers kind words of encouragement in a moment of fear... wonderful!

4782610,5,B005LAII62,"That is to say, it was a lot better than the advertising let on.

I will caution that this movie is PG for a reason, some of the content is both too much for the young ones and some of the humor is a bit on the adult side.  That said, Paranorman is a very enjoyable movie that manages to keep you hooked with humor for the first two acts, and then really hits home with the drama in the third quite unexpectedly.  The sudden shift into drama at the end is a bit jarring, but very satisfying none the less.  It elevates what was a fun older kids flick with some borderline humor snuck in, to a truly recommendable go see it!

The animation style is a bit edgy, I can see some people being turned off by it in the first two acts, but the third really steps it up several notches.  The casting is good, but most of the characters don't do much more than feed into the humor.  Standard fare for kids movies here.  The music and audio were both good, no problems there.

In total, ParaNorman is a good older kids movie with some great easter-eggs and adult humor snuck in, and an unexpectedly meaty and dramatic closing.  Don't let the Halloween gimmick fool you, there's more here than seems at first glance.  Certainly worth a rent at least, I am going to buy.",1382832000,,1257,4.2175732217573225

I think this is a great film for families with children 9 and over. There may be some wariness about death and ghosts, which may require a conversation before viewing the film and definitely after.

4782686,5,B005LAII62,"It is always refreshing to see an alternative from Pixar in the world of animation.
I mean, Pixar got a lot of fantastic films but, Blue Sky, Dreamwork and so on and on all look the same.
One of the few alternatives where the stop motion figures from the weird and wonderful world of Tim Burton.
And the someone else did this extraordenary fantastc looking animation based on the book Coraline by Neil Gaiman.
I though, WOW how is this possible? Do Tim Burton actually got competition now?
And now this beauty! Paranorman seems to be the natural follow up to the weird and kind of spooky beauty from Coraline.
It fits oh so nice in the style of the legendary Nightmare Before Christmas starded in the mid 90`s.
It`s kind of animation for the people who think Disney becomes too cute and those who are tired of Dreamworks and Blue Sky repeating themself.
At the other hand. This is made in a not too edgy and gritty way that would scare away the family only to leave the gothy monstermovie-nerd teenager alone in the sofa. But at the other hand it is scary and edgy enough to be way cool enough for those guys too. And that itself is a pretty impressive achievement. It got a lot of personality and the whole film just look so damn beautiful! The light- effects stands out just like the fog effects stood out in Coraline.

4782964,2,B005LAII62,"I found this movie more than a little worrisome.

The filmmakers created a dark and nasty world populated with angry abusive characters.  The prime victim of the piece is poor Norman Babcock who is consistently picked on by all and sundry, family members included.  If the message of this piece was one of tolerance they achieved the exact opposite.  The clear message here is that in order to gain acceptance (as a freak/outsider) you have to first prove your worth (in this case saving a town).  Otherwise, you aren't accepted as you are.
This movie made me uncomfortable and not a little queasy at times in the way it seemed to revel in the cruelty it inflicts on this one character, doubling the effect by equating him with a little girl who was murdered centuries ago for being a witch.  To make matters worse, they force a showdown between these two victims, that reaches grotesque proportions of brutality, pain, and suffering.

Truthfully I found it a lot preachier than I expected. In the heavy-handed, bang me over the head way. There were a couple funny one-liners but they never went anywhere. And the family dynamics were confusing. Whose mother was grandmom? And where did the uncle fit in to that family tree?

4783110,4,B005LAII62,"What a delightful little oddball of a film. ParaNorman is a stop-motion feature from the same production company who brought us Coraline, and it's easy to spot the similarities. Both are charming and creepy stop-motion family films, while bringing enough jokes and even chills to keep the parents in the audience entertained.

The somewhat thin premise is that Norman, a preteen boy who can speak to the dead, has to break a witch's curse in his New England town celebrating its 300th anniversary. The fairly simple plot fortunately is brought to life through the colorful cast of supporting characters; Norman's school bully (voiced by the actor who played McLovin of all people!) and Norman's older sister are just two of the highlights.

A surprising edge and wit also keep the story feeling fresh and engaging throughout the film. In one of the laugh-out-loud moments, Norman's mentor (another ghost whisperer) tells Norman to ""swear"" to break the witch's curse, to which Norman replies, ""Like what? The `f' word?""

Toward the third act the plot runs a little long (particularly in the surreal and visually entrancing, yet ultimately predictable climax) but the journey is consistently engaging and intriguing. Stop-motion films consistently produce fascinating worlds that are tons of fun to explore (especially in 3D) and ParaNorman is no exception; you almost want the screen to pause so you can better appreciate the detail in the setting and characters.

While it does clock on for a bit too long, ParaNorman is still a breath of fresh air for animation, providing solid and quality entertainment with some really stunning visuals. It is very rare and exciting to find a family horror film with genuine thrills, and is even more special to find one with such a strong and endearing young protagonist.",1369440000,,1809,5.08080808080808
4783111,4,B005LAII62,"This was one of those movies with a really cute trailer, the little boy with all the zombie stuff in his room, posters, clocks, lights, etc.  Turns out he is a boy that can see and talk to the dead and it doesnt freak him out as much as those around him, even the ghosts are not freaking out they can be seen.  The animation is good through a bit gross, slimy, gooey and floppy corpse tongue, if you have a kid or wife that doesnt like that sort of thing you might want to warn them.  The story was good and more original then some of the things that are out there lately, though the twist was easy to see coming (and I am often surprised in movies) so I would say it is a bit more of a kids flick than some of the other animation out there.",1369267200,2,741,3.9266666666666667
4783112,5,B005LAII62,"This movie is absolutely beautiful inside and out. The ""bullying"" issue is one of great importance, that often gets swept under the rug. It is so refreshing to have a children's film creatively address both bullying issues (and with a subtle commentary on homosexuality as well) and encourage such positive values in young children. This film brings me to tears every time.

The quality of the blu-ray is wonderful. The picture is sharp and colorful.",1369267200,,450,5.0
4783113,1,B005LAII62,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone - especially kids. I put it on for my grandson (4 years old) and had to turn it off. It was not funny and was very much on the gross side. When the dead body of a large man fell on top of the little boy and his tongue was all over the boy's face, that was the last straw. The way the little boy (Norman) treated this dead man's body was horrific. We turned it off and threw out the DVD. My grandson was glad it was gone. Found this to be totally unacceptable for kids and not funny for adults.",1369008000,8,536,3.881818181818182
4783114,3,B005LAII62,"I was intrigued by the story idea for this animated feature, but the movie turned out to be pretty much just okay.  The animation is claymation-style and pretty well done, but the story could have used some tweaking.  It wasn't as funny as it should have been and got a bit too scary in places for some younger kids.

Norman is the local strange kid because he sees ghosts and no one believes him.  He chats with his grandma as they watch tv together on a regular basis.  His town is preparing to celebrate the anniversary of an event from 300 years ago when the courts tried and executed a witch.  In fact, the town pretty much makes its tourist trade off of this past event (shades of Salem?).

However, it turns out the story is true and that the witch is about to wake up and raise the dead (zombies) and punish the town.  Norman is called upon by his wacky uncle to take over as the one and only person who can stop this from happening, but nobody believes him...at first.

There are some interesting twists to this movie and I won't spoil it by giving them away.  But the zombies are not quite what they seem and so is the witch.  Still, I'm not sure this is worth a second viewing and was glad I hadn't paid to see it in the theatre.  I think the script could have used one more re-write and there is some adult situations in the movie that might be bothersome to some parents.",1369008000,,1384,4.240458015267175

4783148,4,B005LAII62,"PARANORMAN has caused a certain degree of controversy among parents in search of children's fare, so you should know upfront that this is not a movie that pre-schoolers will take kindly.  Young children are likely to find it too frightening and the references obscure.  It's really more of a pre-teen-and-up sort of flick.  That said, it's a fun, unpretentious little movie with some of the best stop-motion animation I've seen in a long time, and while I wouldn't put it in the same league as THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of times more.

The story focuses on bullying, a deservedly hot topic.  Norman Babcock is your average kid except for one thing: he can see and talk to dead people.  His mother attempts to be understanding a new-agey sort of way; his father is in explosive disbelief; his teen-age, cell-phone-addicted sister Courtney finds the whole thing embarassing.  But there is one person who believes him: his peculiar Uncle Prederghast, who believes it because he can do it himself.  For most of life Uncle Prederghast has been guarding a secret, and it has something to do with the town's history, which includes an unsavory story of a dangerous witch, a curse, and the living dead.  But Uncle Prederghast is getting old, and he's eager to pass on responsibility to Norman.

Throughout the film characters bully each other frequently--but then find themselves in the wrong, and most often discover their bullying is based on a fear of what they do not understand.  Of particular interest is the notion that bullying is something that is passed along: you bully me, I bully the next kid, and so on.  This being a movie (as opposed to real life), all the characters (including zombies and the evil witch) learn to break the cycle.  Along the way we have references to SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO (those meddling kids!), MARS ATTACKS (the scurrying hand), HALLOWEEN (cell phone music), and FRIDAY THE 13TH (hockey mask.)  A lot of the fun of the film is in recognizing these, so ""movie nerds"" are likely to enjoy it more than others will.

The movie was originally released in 3D on the big screen, and I suspect it played better in that format than it does on DVD.  Whatever the case, the DVD comes with several entertaining extras.  Recommended.

4783152,3,B005LAII62,"The second half of 2012 saw four big name animated films released on the big screen.  One of them, Wreck-It Ralph, ran away at the box office and was loved by critics.  The other three, Frankenweenie, ParaNorman, and Hotel Transylvania, battled for second place.  All four films had great animation, good casting, a good blend of action, comedy, and drama, and a solid advertising campaign preceding their American releases.  All four films also had un-original origins in that they all drew heavily from prior animated blockbusters.  So why the sharp difference in performance?  The answer to this is key to understanding costumer choices, and the ability to distinguish oneself from their competitors.  Wreck-It Ralph stood out as it was the only film about video games, and featured an antihero in the lead role.  The other three films seemed eerily similar in that their plots delved into the world of the supernatural - horror fantasy genres, and featured child characters in the lead roles.  Frankenweenie is basically Frankenstein with a dog instead of a man, and a boy instead of a doctor.  ParaNorman was an animated remake of Sixth Sense blended with plot-lines from other horror films.  And Hotel Transylvania drew upon elements of multiple horror films.  Its as if most of Hollywood shared the same scripts and screenplays, but just changed up the casting and animation style.  This is unfortunate, as the latter three were solid films, and each would have performed much better  in the absence of the other two.

Now my review for ParaNorman.  The plot line seems like a hybrid of Sixth Sense, and a multitude of films about witches, such as Lords of Salem.  The pace of the movie was fairly slow, with none of the manic action and snappy dialogue common to other animated films.  The soundtrack matched the pace of the movie.  The plot logic was sound, with great attention to detail.  The animation was believable though nothing spectacular.  There were some scary scenes in the film that toddlers would probably get nightmares from, so I would not bring anyone under 5 to see this film.  Overall, a film that is above average, even borderline good.  Except when stacked up against the competitors that Hollywood put out last year, it failed to stand out...",1368403200,,2272,4.921052631578948

4783229,5,B005LAII62,"This movie has received a lot of ridiculous criticism from people that are most like lousy or lazy parents. It's sad that a movie teaching acceptance is avoided because parents are too scared to let their kids learn. God forbid you teach your kids that some people are different and don't deserve to be bullied or made fun of. I've read reviews on this site and others condemning this movie over it's ""homosexual content"", there's one sentence of dialogue where a man references having a boyfriend. If you can't handle that or are terrified of your kids hearing that then shame on you.

Norman is a kid who sees ghosts and is deeply interested and involved with all things paranormal and it's because of this that he has no friends and suffers bullying and isolation his whole life even his dad struggles with accepting that his son his so weird. This movie has a lot of heavy and sad moments but it's not only appropriate but important.

Wonderful moral and message aside this movie has amazing animation, a fun original story and a really good soundtrack. From the previews I didn't expect to love this movie, I thought it'd be okay at best but it completely blew my mind.

To its credit, ""Paranorman"" does have endearing characters (with the rather dense bodybuilder, Mitch, being my favorite), and I really appreciated that the creators went with a different approach regarding the animation. It's a huge departure from the usual animated fare (I'm a huge animated movie fan, and I watch almost all of them as they're released), and it has a sort of ""Tim Burton"" vibe to it. Personally, I prefer something along the lines of Pixar's animation style, but I applaud the staff of ""Paranorman"" for trying something unique, rather than just being another imitator.",1367107200,,1029,4.846590909090909

4783446,3,B005LAII62,"Norman Babcock (voice by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old boy living in a New England town Blithe Hollow, who loves watching horror movies. And he can speak with the dead. Well, he feels more comfortable speaking with them, as those around Norman, including his own father, just don't understand him.

One day, Norman's estranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast (voice by John Goodman) shows up before him, telling him something about the curse put on the town of Blithe Hollow.

""ParaNorman"" is a classic case of style over substance. The stop-motion animation of Laika, studio that gave us ""Coraline"" in 2009, is certainly unique in blending the beautiful and grotesque, with some witty horror spoof and low-key humor, but it sometimes seems storytelling and character development are tossed aside. In short, the character of Norman is not very interesting. Supporting characters are not so much individuals as types.

This is not to say that ""ParaNorman"" is a dull movie, but given the attractive visuals and enormous efforts to create them, the film deserves a more compelling drama.",1364688000,,1081,5.1657142857142855

4783549,4,B005LAII62,It wasn't the best movie but I would watch it again during Halloween. I felt like the previews in the movies gave the entire story away. I already knew what was going to happen before watching it.,1364428800,,196,4.324324324324325
4783550,5,B005LAII62,"I have to admit that when this movie first came out, I was a bit skeptical about it.  Stop-motion animation is generally not my favorite medium when it comes to movies, although I do respect the time and dedication such a process takes.  The fact that this movie came out around the same time as ""Frankenweenie"" and ""Hotel Transylvania"" probably didn't help -- too many similar-seeming movies at one time, I suppose.  But in the end, I decided to give it a shot, and brought it home from our library.

Despite not being a zombie fan, I couldn't help but enjoy this movie.  It's hilarious, spooky without being gory, and has a much-needed message beneath the silly antics.

""ParaNorman"" is the story of Norman, a young boy from the town of Blithe Hollow who can speak to the dead... and is ostracized for his abilities by both his family and his schoolmates.  When his crazy uncle, the only family member he's on speaking terms with, dies and entrusts him with the family duty to keep the spirit of a vengeful witch sealed away (yes, in that order), Norman is at first skeptical.  But when the witch's power brings a group of zombies to life and threatens to destroy the town, Norman has to rely on some unlikely help -- his loser friend Niel, Niel's dumb jock older brother Mitch, his cheerleader sister Courtney, and school bully Alvin -- to end the curse.  He soon discovers that all is not what it seems on this quest, and that fear can be the greatest evil of all.

Created by the makers of ""Coraline,"" the attention to detail in this film is phenomenal, especially given that much of it is stop-motion instead of CGI.  (My brother even forgot at points that he wasn't watching a CGI film.)  The character designs are not pretty, but they are unique and fit the quirky style of the movie, a nice change from most CGI films where most of the characters look like the same plastic dolls repeated ad nauseum.  The film is quite atmospheric as well, capturing the feel of a New England autumn remarkably well, and the night scenes are especially creepy and well-done.

The story, while it falls into some of the usual horror clich&eacute;s (the ostracized kid with a special ability, the dumb but helpful sidekick friend, the brainless jock and cheerleader, the ignorant townsfolk), does manage to turn some of the horror tropes on their heads.  The zombies are perhaps the best example of this... but I won't say any more so as not to spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie.  And while it can be effectively creepy at times, it's also side-splittingly funny, and kept surprising our family as it went along.  And as mentioned above, it carries a message about acceptance and fear that's much-needed in this day and age.

Word of warning -- this movie is rated PG, and it milks that rating for all it's worth.  There's quite a bit of innuendo and off-color humor, and enough scary moments that I don't advise young children to watch this.  Parents might want to screen this film before giving it to their kids, and judge whether their children are old enough to handle it.

All in all a fun, spooky-but-not-terrifying film that would make a good double-bill feature with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monster-House/dp/B000K3QJRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monster House</a>&nbsp;or the aforementioned&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenweenie-2012/dp/B00AYDC5HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenweenie (2012)</a>.

4783611,5,B005LAII62,"I was quite impressed with ""ParaNorman."" The voice acting is great and the music is beautiful. Visually, the film is stunning. There is some serious stylization going on in the character design that looks really weird in still images, but when the characters are in motion, it doesn't matter. There's a pretty cool sequence at the end that's a smooth marriage of stop-motion and CGI. It looks amazing!

The story follows a little boy named Norman who has the strange ability to see ghosts and speak to them. Apparently, people have heard and he's teased for it, even his own father wanting him to just be normal.

Norman is befriended by another social outcast, a young kid named Neil who's fat. Norman doesn't really want a friend, but Neil doesn't mind Norman's oddball gift and even wants to see if Norman can help him play with his recently deceased dog. (""He was hit by an animal rescue vehicle. Tragic and ironic."")

However, Norman's uncle pops up on the scene. Something bad is about to happen and Norman needs to be told: the dead are coming! It's tied to the Witch's Curse of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts: a witch was being tried and cursed her accusers to death and to rise again.

To keep her curse at bay, someone with the gift of seeing and speaking with the dead (like Norman, his uncle, and as we can later see, the witch herself: the gift is subtly noted in character design with hexagon-shaped pupils and irises) must read from a book at her grave before sundown once a year. Norman's uncle was doing this, but dies before he can tell Norman what to do, but when he tells him posthumously, he doesn't give him enough details.

As Norman tries to read the book at the old graveyard, he's too late as the seven accusers of the witch rise from the dead.

With zombies invading the town of Blithe Hollow, it's up to Norman, Neil, Norman's sister Courtney, Neil's brother Mitch, and school bully Alvin to put the witch's curse at bay again: for now and always.

""ParaNorman"" is a wildly fun, mildly creepy movie with a great message about being non-discriminatory. It's a great film for getting you in the mood for Halloween.

I picked up the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack, and was impressed that the DVD and Blu-Ray contained the same special features on both discs.

There were only 2 out of screen effects that came out 30 and 50% into the room and only a few more that came out to 10%, I personally kept lowering my 3d glasses to see if there was a blur on the screen because it didn't look 3d to me.

It started off well enough, except the public school teaching religious anything, because that doesn't happen in real life.  Humorous at first, good lines and good voice acting.

There are some visually impressive moments and the voice cast does fairly well, but the movie's original concept gets mired in the all-too-familiar underdog who saves the day.  And the humanizing of zombies purifies the film, leaving no real source of conflict.

4784117,3,B005LAII62,"The main point of the story is an anti-bully message, but the way it goes about it paints Puritans of old as people who were ""afraid of what they don't know"" and made stupid mistakes (by burning witches) is a backwards approach to demonizing judgment. Fact is, no one in the world has natural ""occultic"" powers because they were born with it, they focus on doing evil things in order to get that power, it's never forced on somebody against their will by birth (such as your gender or skin color). They are mixing choices that you physically make with attributes that you can't control (like saying who you choose to have sex with is the same as being born blind, you don't choose to not be blind one day or on the same hand are forced to have sex literally all the time). It's a typical liberal minded story that conforms to a growing societal shift in the nation (with the misconception of be more ""evolved"" or ""civilized"" than before because people are less disciplined on what we do because ""we don't know, thus we are afraid"", because we are too stupid and only the 'enlightened' can teach us the way). It's a battle of morality that determines what we consider as okay, and this is an example of mixing something that's bad (bullying) with something that had basis for judgment but warping it to make it seem okay (inhuman ""magical"" powers being against ones wishes and claiming historical events prove that whatever happened was wrong because they weren't enlightened to our current way of thinking). A real disconnect and the movie could have made a great monster movie without trying to make the moral the plot and thus trying to shove credibility with historical inaccuracy to make a point.",1361577600,,1700,4.651162790697675

4784122,3,B005LAII62,"I really wanted to like Paranorman and, well, I basically did.  For me it lived up to both the praise and the criticism, simultaneously, somehow.  Some things about the movie really work, including:

The stop-motion animation, which is beautiful. I've never seen it done so well and it really shows the care someone put into this movie.  The characters don't look too cartoony and the horror-scene visuals are truly creepy.

The archetypal characters, who are used to good effect and in many ways seem to be tongue-in-cheek.  The humor, too, is corny and somewhat predictable, but that doesn't mean I didn't laugh.  What can I say?  It's very cute.

Notably, however, there are some important elements which really miss the mark (spoilers):

The entire sense of danger is misplaced.  When the witchcloud first appeared in the sky, it was *clearly* coming from a particular spot on the ground some miles from where Norman was standing.  Wouldn't that have been a good place to check for her grave?  Norman didn't have to go to the records building at all.  A slightly different visual would have made this a non-issue, but as it stands the illogic is glaring.

Finally, the moral of the story is ham-fisted and flawed.  Tolerance is good, okay?  Nobody should have been mean to Norman.  But expecting people to refrain from flipping out at zombies is a bit much, especially when the zombies don't get around to explaining their presence until it's plot convenient.  And Aggie?  It was wrong to kill her, no one's arguing that, but she WAS in fact a witch.  So much for misunderstood.  The whole witch-trial plot doesn't work the same when witches exist.

So overall, I liked the idea of Paranorman better than the execution.  I really really wish it had been a triumph of characterization and storytelling, since it found itself at the middle of a mild debate about values and stuff.  But I guess I shouldn't expect every movie to be a cultural landmark, even when it's obviously trying to be. *sigh*",1361491200,,1999,4.7917888563049855

4784274,3,B005LAII62,"Okay so I've finally gotten a chance to write this review. Before we get into too much detail I have to say that I did ""enjoy"" this movie but not for many other reasons than the idea that it is in itself a handmade piece of artwork. (These are the folks who did the production for the Coraline movie and oh how well they do the animation for this; a majority of it is still classic stop motion and it's so awesome)! However, I don't really think it's a perfect movie. I'll tell you why...

Plot: **POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Skip this if you haven't seen the whole movie!**
The plot is rather straightforward with a small cast of interesting characters. It's a very colorful story but it suffers from predictability. There's not much you can do with a story about a boy who's outcast from society other than to have him find a way to be accepted in the end, and there's not a lot you can do involving this cast of characters other than be completely torn between helping him or fighting against him. All of the elements of a standard children's movie are there and as an young adult (or even an older adult watching with your kids; I really think you should if this is the case), you'll find yourself rolling your eyes at the obvious hints of where the story direction goes. (Ie: The bully becomes a friend; Normal is eventually accepted by his family and society overall etc...). Not to diss on it, but the plot, because its so predictable, it just a little ""meh"" and lack luster. We've seen this done before but maybe the hand-made and some ""mood"" aspects of this may be the reason it is watchable, but not perfect. I'll talk about story content a little later, but to me, the older tone was remeniscent of a cross between an old Don Bluth animated film and a 1980s Chris Columbus film in animation form.

Characters:
Paranorman provides us with a cast of interesting characters. Anyone you assume to be involved with this sort of story. We see a good array of folks you can relate to, (for the kids and maybe even for some adults; Norman stands the most prominent but he's a little droll to stand alone as a decent or interesting character). I feel like they really didn't do a whole lot with his powers (making them relevant to the story in some aspects) presenting him as maybe just a whiny outcast kid. However, a friend who Norman eventually makes, helps balance this out. Other characters (namely one) seemed just to be a background or one-shot character. (I think there's even one recurring background character who's supposed to be paying homage to the ""Jim"" character from the first season of The Walking Dead).

Content:
With a movie like this (one related to Coraline) this movie is a little older. Honestly in some spots it feels like a PG-13 movie. It's definitely got some relatively (but not overly) graphic scenes (not blood and guts but definitely may be nightmare fuel for some younger audiences).

Because its a movie dealing with the theme of ""death"" many parents may have some qualms about letting their kids watch this by themselves. Some parts that I found on-the-edge-of-your-seat, some children may find rather scary.

There are some good morals mixed in with the action of this movie also. Underlying themes included seem to ""shame"" some of the people who may discriminate against people of certain life-choices or folks who seem different. BUT I applaud the movie creators for adding in the aspect of forgivness of those people who might be ignorant or scared about it, leaving us without a terribly preachy movie.

Controversy Aspect:
Okay I've both dreaded the need to touch base on this one (and at the same time felt I needed to). Yes, one of the character's in this movie (Mitch: The Jock Character), does reveal himself to have a boyfriend at the end of the movie.

Is it good exposure for the gay community... I say ""maybe,"" only because the way that it is revealed feels more satirical and ""in your face"" revelations.

Even so, it's such a tiny, TINY portion of the movie that it's hardly worth the mention, however, some parents may find this (within a family movie especially) to be a little offensive. Even as a relatively conservative fellow myself, I feel that it is still pretty innocent though and I think so long as folks are aware of this little sucker punch they might be able to handle this a bit more calmly.

Basically all it boils down to is, ""it's just a joke,"" folks and other than the reveal it doesn't shove it in your face as bad as some people think it might. There's a lot of other content in this movie that I would worry about BEFORE worrying about the inclusion of a ""gay character.""

Conclusion:
Overall the movie is watchable. You'll find yourself feeling entertained by a movie that wants to pay homage to the older 70's-80's zombie and monster flicks while learning some good old fashioned moral values about the way we treat other people also. Have some fun with this one.

I recommend before anyone listens to the high reviews that they rent it and decide for themselves.  Don't feel pressure to buy because people are claiming it's the best movie of 2012.

4784344,5,B005LAII62,"I watched this movie in the theaters twice. And loved it both times. Now I just placed my order for the blue ray and DVD.

The movie was a bit on the scary side. As a grown woman, I was a bit scared in the beginning too and at one point thought to myself "" WT heck? I thought this was a kid's movie!"". Then again, I'm a chicken and don't usually do horror at all. I did notice kids crying and parents walking out but midway through the movie it settled down and you stopped being scared. Or even disturbed. And that is what makes this movie beautiful. It didn't surprise me that the director said he was inspired by his own experience as a kid bullied. I think anyone who has been bullied ( and dare I say bullied others) probably can see a bit of themselves in Aggie and Norman and the other characters.

This movie was sophisticated and showed values of empathy, kindness, bravery, sympathy, acceptance and most of all, forgiveness. All of which Norman displays in his quest. I thought it would be a great movie for kids. Judging the response from some of the adults, they could learn something from this movie too.

I don't believe the morality in the move was all over the place as some have mentioned. I kind of thought it was pretty consistent with what many kids who face bullying experience and the moral dilemma a society and it's people find themselves.

Update:

I just saw the movie on DVD. Spoiler alert: The last scenes music is different from the movie in theatres. Too bad, because the music really made the scene in the end interesting. I don't get the discrepancy in the soundtrack.",1360281600,4,1600,4.410169491525424

However, when he is handed the task of preventing an infamous witch's curse on his town, he learns that having friends has its advantages. And when he confronts the witch at the climax of the film, no better dialogue has ever been written in regards to bullying and passing on hatred as your legacy.

4784686,4,B005LAII62,"With zombies all the rage now, seemingly passing up vampires as the go to monster, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that we get an animated version.  Rated PG, this nice film from the folks who brought us ""Caroline"" a few years ago is edgy enough for older kids and provides enough artistic skill to keep adults interested.

Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11 year old boy who can see and hear dead people and animals...well, not flies.  He's a bit of an oddball at school having to deal with the various ghosts that still lurk around his small town.  The town itself is noted for having witches in its history, including one who still brings her wrath on occasion.  Norman's uncle (John Goodman) tells Norman that is up to him to stop the witch's harassment.

With a book of fairy tales in hand Norman sets out to find the witch's grave.  Instead he unearths a gaggle of zombies who he finds out, had a direct influence on the mean witch's current behavior.  ""Paranorman"" has a moralistic theme of course, but it doesn't hit you right in the face.

The final act really amps up the excellent stop-action visuals and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack.  Speaking of soundtrack; one of the things missing from an otherwise superb film is  good music, something usually a staple for animated films.  The humor is more situational than dialog driven.  A few more over-the-kids-head topical comments would have added something for the adults.  Still, this is a worthwhile watch that should entertain the whole family.",1359763200,,1520,4.730038022813688

4784969,3,B005LAII62,"Paranorman, is a film that truly stands out along with all the Pixar and Dreamworks family films. It is a film that bends the rules with its style of story telling and cast of characters. To sum it all up it is The Sixth Sense for children. It is a story that actually delivers a powerful message about knowing that it is ok if you are different than everyone else.

The positives in this film are the tributes to horror films of the 1980s and the jokes that were thrown in for the adult appeal. Also, being that it is stop motion shows that this style of film making is far from dead. As a matter of fact it is a style that was used many times in 2012 and it shows major signs of strength and improvement in a world of film making dominated by computers. However, the film is far from perfect as far as story, but it does keep the view entertained and apparently it got some Oscar nods so there was obviously something done right here.

Paranorman is worth seeing at least once and it is definitely a film that can start a huge trend in animation. Like the film stresses you can't be a hero, by being normal.",1359158400,,1109,4.2018779342723

4784971,3,B005LAII62,"I rented this on recommendation from my boyfriend. He said this was his favorite movie from 2012.

On a technical aspect, this movie was gorgeous. Stop motion is hard and this movie does it beautifully. Only Tim Burton could do it any better. Really enjoyed the look of the film.

Unlike Avatar, the animation wasn't enough to keep my attention. The story is about a boy who can see and talk to ghosts. Which he does frequently. Instead of developing relationships with real people he develops relationships with ghosts. So of course, he is labeled as the weird kid and gets picked on and beat up. Neil, chubby eccentric kid tries to make friends with him (in the most stalker like way possible).

While all this is going on, Norman's uncle realizes the witch that cursed the town is about to wake up. He tries to recruit Norman to go to the cemetery and read to her grave to put her back to sleep. Norman is unfazed by this and blows him off. Later during a play, Norman begins to have visions which ruins the play and gets him grounded for being weird.

His uncle dies and comes to Norman as a ghost and tells him he must go get the book and read to the grave, Norman reluctantly agrees and his uncle departs for the afterlife. Norman goes to his Uncle's house and has to pry the book out of his uncle's dead hands. He goes to the grave and starts to read but is confronted by the school bully who prevents Norman from reading the story, so the witch wakes up.

Zombies start rising from the graves sending everyone into a panic. Norman, Neil, Norman's sister and Niel's brother get confronted by the zombies and the town mob at town all. The witch appears and starts attacking. Norman climbs the Town Hall to read the story but the witch destroys the book and knocks Norman out.

When Norman was passed out and has a vision that the ""witch"" was actually a young girl named Agatha who could talk to ghosts like him. She was executed for being a witch but cursed the town before she died. When he wakes up he realizes the Zombies (the men who sentenced and executed Agatha) were trying to talk to him and get him to calm Agatha's spirit to make amends for what they did to her.

He slips the Zombies pass the mob and they show him Agatha's resting place now the center of her power. Norman realizes he doesn't want to just put her back to sleep but to save her. He reminds her of the good things she had in life.

She calms down and joins the afterlife as the curse lifts. Norman is a hero and he enjoys a quiet family movie with mom, dad, sis and grandma's ghost.

4785463,4,B005LAII62,"""ParaNorman"" is a macabre-but-endearing animated children's film produced by Laika, Inc, which seems to specialize in the genre. They also produced ""Coraline"" (2009). Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old middle school outcast who sees, and talks to, dead people. He sees his deceased grandmother (Elaine Stritch) at home, for which his father berates him. He sees, and greets, dead people in the streets. But one day, Norman begins to see things that even he does not believe. Terrifying things. His eccentric uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) tells Norman that the 300-year-old ""Witch's Curse"" is real and insists that Norman is the only person who can save their New England town from being run over by zombies raised from the grave on the anniversary of the curse. So Norman feels compelled to give it a try.

I enjoyed the macabre humor in ""ParaNorman"". The dead are apparently not sacred to Chris Butler, who wrote the film and co-directed it with Sam Fell. He makes fun of them, the ways they died, and the reactions of the living. That makes ""ParaNorman"" equally suited to adults as to children. It's just funny. For children, it takes a little inspiration from Harry Potter. Norman is a gifted boy who must solve the mystery of the Witch's Curse and save the town. In his case, he must overcome obstructionist adults, and his attempt at library research is fruitless. But the characters are all stereotypes: the indulgent understanding mother, overbearing intolerant father, self-obsessed teenaged sister, dim-witted school bully, etc. The stereotypes are plugged into the story, and they are funny. But it's as if Butler didn't take the time to write characters.",1357948800,,1690,5.101083032490974

The movie progresses through a story in which the boy has to save his town and along the way convinces people he's not crazy or imaginative.
Overall, the movie was good and I got some laughs out of it. The humor isn't so highbrow that kids (mine are 12 and 14) won't get it. It's definitely a movie I'd buy again.",1357689600,,586,4.2792792792792795

It would have been fine on a short movie, but it is clear that it had to be stretched too much to fill a full-length feature (a common defect of too many movies). It is essentially a tale of the redemption of all the inhabitants of a small town. the problem is that their conversion from stupid and nasty to smart and nice is poorly done. It only happens in the last five minutes of the movie and it felt too rushed, forced and unbelievable.

4786078,1,B005LAII62,"To sum it up, Paranorman (real clever title by the way. They probably came up with the name first and wrote the script around it) is a formulaic romp abounding in a typical story arch of the alienated hero and his overweight sidekick, heavily laced with bad humor for those with ADD and the most confused and contradictory set of morals I've yet seen. *PLEASE NOTE, I'M NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OR REFERENCES TO SEX, VIOLENCE AND HOMOSEXUALITY HERE, JUST EVERYTHING ELSE.

***Warning, here be spoilers!***

Norman Babcock, a young boy with the ability to speak to the dead, must endure living with his strange gift which no one believes him to possess. He is taunted by the usual cardboard cut-outs of bullies, one of which becomes something of a second side kick later on, and endure his father's disapointment in him. To be fair, the opening to this movie seemed promising. The scene where he's watching zombie movies with his deceased grandmother's ghost was a good enough way to open the movie, as was the scene in which he's walking to school and interacting with the various ghosts who wander in purgatory; the way he interacts with the ghosts, which the audience initially cannot see, bespeaks a certain sense of innocence in young Norman as he greets them. When the audience is allowed to see all the ghosts it makes the movie goer beleive the rest of the movie might include much more talking to the dead. Sadly, this is the most we ever see of Norman using his abilities to speak to the dead and also when the movie peaks. The rest is a slow descent into bad, stupid jokes, and a confused, meandering plot.

Norman and his overweight, social misfit friend Neil meet Norman's eccentric Uncle Mr. Prenderghast, a not all together there hobo who tells Norman that he soon must take up a family right of passage to protect the town from the ghost of an evil witch that comes in cycles once every generation.

Soon after, while rehearsing a school play about the trial and execution of said witch 300 years earlier, Norman has a vision of encroaching evil. He has the same vision again during the play only with himself as the witch being chased by an angry mob. Naturally, this ruins the play and we have a scene in which his father vents his anger and disapointment at him. At this point I was underwhelmed by the tired father who won't accept his son cliche but I would have let it pass had the rest of the movie been as enjoyable as the first part.
Already, you know from my rating it wasn't.

Mr. Prenderghast then dies...in comical fashion, and by comical I mean ""comical."" He has a heart-attack, convulses on the floor and then his spirit drifts away, only to land back inside the body for immediate resurection, just like in an old Loony Tunes cartoon, except it's not funny but weirdly morbid. Just when he thinks he's beat his imminent demise he finally croaks and his spirit says, ""Ah, nuts,"" or something to that effect just to imply that THIS IS FUNNY! Except it's still morbid and whatever humor is there is forced. Unfortunately, this isn't the last time Prenderghast's death is made light of, more on that later.

Norman is then visited by Prenderghast's ghost at school. Wacky hijinks ensue as Prenderghast pops out of toilet and splashes water all over the place. Prenderghast then tells Norman that soon he must fulfill his destiny of staving off the cyclical evil occurrence from wreaking havoc on the town by reading from a special book. This book, as it happens, was in the hands of Prenderghast when he died...you can pretty much see where this will lead. Prenderghast, his conscience clean, then passes on to the afterlife despite Norman's insistence that he needs more help and information to go on other than just, ""read from this special book where the witch is buried!"" Prenderghast then departs in a explosion of light which wrecks most of the bathroom, implying that whenever a soul passes on after fulfilling its unfinished business an unexplainable explosion occurs. Okay, Weird...
Prenderghast just seems like a jerk here. ""Norman! You have a special destiny, have a nice day!"" *Poof!* If there was any justice in the universe, God wouldn't have let him pass on but forced him to stay and help Norman. Lord knows a ghost sidekick might have spiced up this movie.

Norman then departs for his deceased Uncle's house so he can pry away the special book from his rigor mortis stricken corpse. We get that funny scene from Young Frankenstein of trying to wrench a book from dead hands except it's not funny and is painfully prolonged to distasteful lows, such as his Uncle's corpse falling on Norman, his lolling tongue slaping his face.

Norman then takes the book to the cemetary with the sketchy instructions he got from his Uncle to read the book at the place where the witch from 300 years earlier was buried. He opens the special book only to discover that it is an ordinary book of fairy tales (keep this in mind later as I'll be ranting about it). Before he can do this, Norman's bully, Alvin intrudes. Soon after, a storm brews and the clouds take on the sinister appearance of a witch. The ghost witch the uses its powers to raise the zombiefied bodies of seven Puritan judges whom she cursed when they sentenced her to death. They flee the scene only to run into Norman's bratty, teenage sister stereotype who was looking for him along with Neil and his older brother jock stereotype. The zombies chase them into town and soon after Norman deduces that the ritual to stop the witch did not work since he was not at the place where the witch was interred. He calls up the brainy, condescending, glasses wearing stereotype who informs him that witchs are buried in unmarked graves. The only way he can find the whereabouts of her unmarked grave-let me repeat that-HER UNMARKED GRAVE, is to go to the Town Hall archives to learn its location...............HER UNMARKED GRA-If the witch's grave is unmarked then why in the hell would its location be listed in any of the archives! Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of it being unmarked!

Oh, well.

The kids make their way to the Town Hall archives with the zombies still in pursuit. Let's do a quick head count of the kids and their stereotype before we continue further. We've got the quiet, alienated hero, the fat kid, the bully, the jock and the bit of teenage, female Americana. That sounds like a real motley crew. Maybe afterwards they can all go look for One-Eyed Willy's treasure!

The kids manage to break into the Town Hall in the futile attempt to find the location of the aforementioned UNMARKED GRAVE! while the zombies, baffled and beguiled by modern society freak out and cause a town wide panic eventually culminating in a violent mob, complete with torches and pitchforks. There's supposed to be a bit of poetic irony here in that the zombiefied Puritans are finding themselves at the other end of the pitchfork but I'm too preoccupied with the idea of going to the Town Hall in the 0.0000000000000000000000001 percent chance that they'll learn the location to an UNMARKED GRAVE to notice.

The violent mob eventually reaches the Town Hall where the children have barracated themselves. Norman, in his frustration, abandons the attempt to learn the witch's whereabouts to try to confront the witch in the clouds overhead himself. This might seem like a fruitless endeavor, if only trying to learn the location of an UNMARKED GRAVE weren't already more so. With a violent storm brewing and an angry mob all around, Norman then climbs the spire of the Town Hall in order to try and read fairy tales from a story book to an angry, wicked witch face in the clouds. I really, really wish I was making this up.

Come to think of it, if all he needed was to read fairy tales then why did he need this one special book? Couldn't he have just gone to any Barnes & Noble and bought a copy of Grimm's Fairy tales? Come on! Also, per Norman's decision to confront the witch their whole trip to archives, which has now taken up a pretty good chunk of the movie, is now rendered pointless. *que image of unsharpened pencil*

Norman is then hit by a lightning bolt and blacks out. During his unconsciousness, he dreams that he is the witch being persecuted by the Puritan judges as he stands in their semi-circle of fear and loathing. He then learns that the witch wasn't really a witch at all but a girl his age who was condemned because they feared her awesome psychic abilities. The little girl goes from frightened to frighteningly angry as she vows to get revenge on them all.

Norman wakes up and is confronted by the zombie puritans who, as it turns out, did not want to munch on his brains but rather talk to him as Norman, being able to talk to the ""dead"" would be the only one able to talk to them. I put dead in quotes because the zombies are not ethereal and are visible to everyone else, and also because Norman, in additition to being a medium, also apparently has the ability to understand the zombie moaning and groanings as some kind of necrophonic language. Only a portion of Norman's abilities are being used here since other people can see the zombies and it's by now it's been ages since we've seen Norman speak with a ghost. Norman could have just had the ability to talk to zombies and this movie's convoluted plot wouldn't have missed a beat. The zombies, as it turns out, are totally sorry for being so mean to the little girl who has now cursed them with living death and is now causing violent thunderstorms that treaten to kill the citizenry. They tell Norman that as the only one able to speak to the dead it's up to him to ""put the little ghost girl back to sleep by reading her fairy tales."" WTF?

Because reading Fairy Tales to an evil ghost child to ""put it to back sleep"" regularly was a stupid idea in the first place, Norman vows to find a more permenant solution. He visits the little girl who is named Agatha for a final confrontation. Agatha actually looks kind of badass at this point. She has glowing, spiky yellow hair and her ghost body is crackling with electricity. The moral of this movie up to his point is that it's wrong to persecute people who are different out of mere fear, but honestly, if a little girl could go Super Saiyan I'd be pretty afriad of her too. Granted, not enough to kill her but, yeah.

Norman tries to talk sense in Agatha by telling her that her blind resentment towards her executioners has made her into a bully no different than they. By giving into her anger, she lowers herself to their level and thus continues, in perpetuity, the cycle of fear mongering and persecution.
Dude, that is so deep! Oh, excpet for the part where we're told to not hate on people who murder a little girl!
Agatha's violent electrical storms then reach a climax as there is a bright flash of light followed by several seconds of hushed silence.

So it's come down to a ""quiet moment,"" eh? Well, to quote the Nostalgia Critic when he reviewed Little Nemo, ""No, nothing you have done so far warrents a quiet moment!"" We're then treated to a touching seen of Agatha with her mother and her happiest memories sitting by a tree. She feels comforted by Norman who knowns how it feels to be an outcast with unique abilities and let's go of her anger. Able to move on, Agatha departs for the afterlife, along with the zombies, whose corpses mysteriously vanish too (no explaination given), and everything is restored to normal...well, except for the thousands in property damage. The movie closes with a happy ending and Norman's sister Courtney hits on the jock, Mitch by asking him to go to a movie with her, to which Mitch replies, ""My boyfriend loves chick flicks!"" Sadly, out of all the stupid, fast paced humor, this was the funniest joke in the whole movie, but also the one blemish which is twisting the panties and/or magic underwear of all the WASPs and Mormon who, even as you are reading this are angrily typing negative reviews for all the wrong reasons.

Paranorman was a terrible movie. It's pacing was bad, it's characters were dull, it's morals were confused and it's humor was terrible at best. It's sad because some of the ideas presented in the plot were interesting. The idea of this ghost girl finding redemption would have been wholly unique were it not for the fact that Brave, an animated movie with way better story, character development and jokes, had done a redemption story first and way better.

This Movie's ""morals"" were so confusing. In the end, it was wrong to persecute Agatha and call her a witch, even though she pretty mcuh was; it was wrong to fear her, even though those same fears ended up being validated; it's wrong to hold a grudge against bigoted, religious fanatics for the apparently small crime of killing a child; the classic depiction of witchs as ugly crones is false, even though an ugly crone was clearly visible in the clouds, cackling madly; and lastly...uh...don't persecute and alienate weirdos or else they might turn emo and go postal on your ass. Seriously, this movie is so messed up in the moral department that virtually no one is innocent. Everyone is guilty of some crime but we're told that they were really innocent the whole time. I call bull on this.

I really don't understand how this movie could be so popular with all the plot holes and story archs that went nowhere. I went into this movie with high hopes. Those hopes have just furiously typed this review.",1357344000,17,13489,4.621452420701169

4786082,4,B005LAII62,"I have seen trailers for ParaNorman since last year. When I saw the first one, which had a very odd song choice for the trailer and nothing to really grab the audience, I thought it was an easy pass. Then, the more I saw of the film, including the giant witch head in the sky, it made me want to actually give the film a shot. So, does this animated feature have a story as great as the animation looks, or is it a script that should have remained in the grave?

ParaNorman comes from Laika, Inc., the studio responsible for the 2009 animated film, Coraline. So, of course, the stop motion animation looks amazing. But what about the story? Our hero of the film is Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), a kid who can see and communicate with ghosts. Now, being the weird kid is always tough, and being the weird kid that sees ghosts is even tougher. Befriended by fellow social outcast Neil (Tucker Albrizzi), Norman's life gets even stranger when his distant uncle (John Goodman) comes with a bizarre warning that Norman must step up to protect his town. Protect from what? A witch that was convicted of, well, witchcraft, and killed in the very town Norman lives in many years ago. This is where the film picks up, and it really does an outstanding job of telling a compelling story.

Now, ParaNorman has another thing going for it, and that is that it takes advantage of the 3D craze going around. Being the first stop motion film to use color 3D printers, this colorful and imagination filled world really pops with the 3D glasses. Remember, the 3D these days is meant to give the film a sense of depth, and for ParaNorman, it exceeds that aspect easily. This is definitely a film go the extra mile on and see in glorious 3D.

All in all, for an animated film, it did have some more mature themes in it, but it also had some important life lessons and an amazing ending. The story is original, the characters are memorable, and the zombies look great on screen; what more can you ask for? One of the best animated films this year, make sure to catch ParaNorman on DVD or Blu Ray.",1357171200,,2072,4.433070866141732

Granted, it wasn't a lot, but I would have expected better for a movie geared towards kids. My daughter keeps asking me about getting the movie, but I won't buy it. The message that it portrays about not judging people is a good message, but I do not like movies that are geared towards kids and have profanity in it, or references to sex. Also, my daughter likes to watch movies so much that within a day or two she knows every line in that movie. I don't like keeping her from watching her movies, but this is one that I would have to restrict heavily due to the profanity, which is another reason why I will not buy it, no matter how much she asks me.

4786357,1,B005LAII62,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  Paranorman, the new stop action animated horror comedy, comes from the creators of Coraline, the 1999 Alice in Wonderland-like stop action animated feature, which garnered fairly good reviews. I faulted Coraline for its lack of originality and characters that didn't have enough charm. I'm sad to report that Paranorman represents a big step backward for the creators of Coraline, as it's much more derivative than its precursor and manages to exude significantly less charm.

  The film starts off nicely as we slowly pan through the town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, which reminds one of a working-class section of Boston or any of those eastern or central Massachusetts towns that happen to feature rows of houses built in the 20s and 30s. We meet the film's protagonist, Norman Babcock, a boy with psychic powers who can communicate with his deceased grandmother inside the house as well as numerous ghosts out on the street. Norman is one of those 'misunderstood' kids who's ridiculed at school as a freak and forms a friendship with another outcast at school, Neil, an overweight kid, who is also constantly bullied.

  In 'Coraline', most of the characters were eccentric but in 'Paranorman', except mainly for Norman and Neil, all the other characters, who are supposed to be funny, are actually either grotesque, mean-spirited or ignorant (some all of the above). The film's animators chose to highlight all the characters' negative attributes by exaggerating their physical deficiencies. For example, Norman's father, Perry, has an enormously protruding pot belly. He's also entirely unsympathetic as he considers his son's interest in psychic phenomena, an embarrassment to the family as well as the community at large. The Paranorman scenarists also fail to get any laughs from Norman's sister Courtney, who proves to be a caricature of a narcissistic teenager who's desperate to find a boyfriend. At the end of picture, we're supposed to laugh when she's rejected by Neil's older flat-topped, super-buffed Ron Howard looking brother, Mitch, who turns out to be gay.

  Today it seems whenever we have a story about a young outcast, he'll always be pitted against a school bully. In this case it's Alvin, who sports a pig-like face and bears a faint resemblance to Bruce Willis. The obnoxious Alvin attempts to torment sensitive Norman until he realizes that everything his opponent is saying about a witch's curse that may destroy the town, comes true. Mrs. Henscher, the schoolteacher, is fairly amusing when she attempts to convince her school kids to emote better while they're performing a play about the 300th anniversary of the town, but later turns ugly (sporting a mud cake facial), joining a mob full of vengeful townspeople, who riot when faced with a group of hapless Zombies. There's also Sheriff Hooper, the overzealous police officer who thinks of shooting first and asking questions later (as the only African-American, some folks may find this character overly stereotypical).

  Saving the worst character for last is Norman's deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who lives on the edge of town and resembles the town drunk--an individual who everyone in the town tries to avoid. Before Prenderghast has a heart attack and dies, he explains that the town is cursed by a little girl who was hung as a witch and took revenge on the seven Puritan townspeople from 300 years ago, who sentenced her to death. In an awfully tasteless scene, after Prenderghast kicks the bucket, rigor mortis sets in and the lifeless, stiff body falls on little Norman--who must extricate himself, not before being licked by the corpse's loose and gross, saliva-filled tongue.

  In addition to all the unlikeable and charmless characters, there's also the amazingly derivative story line. Without the so-called comedy, 'Paranorman' would just be your average Zombie movie. The twist is that Paranorman cops out by becoming completely sentimental. The Zombies were not originally a hate-filled mob who sentenced poor little Agatha to death--they were merely 'afraid'. And now Norman points out, the mob full of Blithe Hollow denizens, have becomes just as bad as their cowering ancestors.

  Norman ends up by making everything right by engaging in a 'heart-to-heart' with the now demented and vengeful little Agatha. Once Norman gets through to Agatha, the souls of the seven Zombies, finally make it to their eternal resting spots (along with of course, little Agatha) and Norman's family and the rest of the town, learn an important lesson about being tolerant of kids with extra sensory abilities as well as Zombies who were not actually hate-crazed bigots, but merely innocently caught up in the mass hysteria of their times.

  Now all that's left is to figure out how this hopeless production became a hit. Well, of course there are all those kids into zombie movies; but what about the critics? Sadly, many of the critics have the sensibilities of all those kids who bought the tickets. Alas, little Agatha is no more. If only Norman could have directed her to have those knuckleheads (aka 'the critics') give 'Paranorman', the rating it deserved. It looks like Metacritic's completely misguided '72', will remain Paranorman's ultimate final composite rating, for all eternity!",1356825600,12,5335,5.169570267131243

Norman talks with the slur of a coward/ wimp that never seems to gain confidence as the movie progresses. Even if you didn't expect it to, it's plain annoying and hard to understand.

Horrid voice acting aside, the dialogue is so stupid that it's mind numbingly painful. **spoiler** Norman says he's the only one that should talk to the witch for the first hour of the movie and when he gets to her, he doesn't know what to say. He sputters some crap about them being similar (without ever mentioning what... being able to talk to ghosts i know) and the witch responds that their different because he's a guy. I mean this scene is supposed to be the climax. Instead they utter nonsense.

The jock is supposed to be a moron, not a vegetable. You can't have a character that doesn't embody any stereotypes. The fat kids jock brother literally IS less intelligent than the zombies in this movie.

The movie has no moral. The witch was killed and Norman tells her that it's not cool to hurt other people. 300 years later of a curse later, she suddenly realizes this and goes to heaven happy... Where's the revelation, puzzle solving, or heart warming speech that satisfies the viewers??

Literally, you need to fill in the blanks for yourself because the movie never explains itself.

Also, the other reviews are right to say there are a ton of sexual innuendos. Many of which belong in Family Guy or Adult Swim.

4786481,5,B005LAII62,"I for one thoroughly enjoyed Paranorman! It was a beautifully, animated movie from the minds of people who are gifted in their craft to bring us this spooky (kind of), funny, heart-warming comedy of the 2012 year. I loved Paranorman because it had a lot of good morals in it.

1. Mob Mentality- We see this in every society, a group of people who have stopped actually ""thinking"" and decided to just play ""follow the leader"" when throughout history it has always lead to heartbreak, destruction, mayhem, violence, and other ignorant and primitive behavior.

2. Killing of the Innocence- To not go into too much detail so that I do not spoil the movie, this movie showed the importance of thinking before one acts. As many spiritual ethics like Buddhism,teaches, to not act or speak when your heart is tainted or bitter. Also, to not judge so quickly with what you are afraid of. Many human beings unfortunately suffer from being afraid of ""The Unknown"" which gets them into a lot of trouble for their actions. Karma is real! The Golden Rule(s) apply to all! Just because you are afraid of something does not mean that you have to act violently, or primitively upon that situation. ""One must think first before they act or speak""

I will not go into detail! I would rather have many more people watch this movie and enjoy it as I did and come away from it thinking for themselves more, because they have seen how horrid, and primitive their actions can become when one thinks that using fire against fire will work... it does not and it never will!

A BIG AND HUGE THANK YOU!!!!! To everyone in the making of this film!

The movie could have been much better.  For example, the movie could have been a kid bullied for his misunderstood special gift of talking to the dead, then town gets terrorized by brain eating zombies (mocking zombie films here), then kid saves the day using his special gift to talk to the zombies and convince them to happily live beside the living, town prospers with tourism to see the zombies.  That's actually what I expected from this film, a zombie comedy, and was disappointed that it wasn't at all that.

It's all fine, I suppose, if you go into this movie expecting it to be sad, morbid, dark, and preachy, but that's not what I expected, and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.",1356652800,2,864,4.436708860759493

4786757,4,B005LAII62,"After reading many good reviews on Amazon and after a personal recommend, I went ahead and picked this movie up on a whim to put in my wife's Christmas stocking, despite neither of us having seen it before.  One kind of movie my wife and I can both agree on watching together is a good animated movie, and I felt that perhaps my wife would like this movie.  A guy I talked to on the day I bought this told asked me if we liked movies like Frankenweenie, Coraline, Corpse Bride, and Nightmare Before Christmas and I told him that we did.  He said that then that we would probably rather like this movie, and sure enough we did.

It really did have that kind of Tim Burton/Henry Sellick kind of feel to it, although it was created and directed by different people, some who actually worked with Henry Sellick on Coraline.  We both like that kind of animation as well as like Dreamworks, Disney, and Pixar type stuff.  ParaNorman was fun, whitty, and entertainingly scary in a few parts...just all around entertaining my wife and I thought.

The one thing I will say is that if your child is real young, I'd say under the age of 7, this film may not exactly be suitable for them.  There is some parts in this movie that would probably scare them, plus there is a small amount of mild language.  There is one reference a male character makes late in the movie about having a boyfriend, but decide on that however you will.  I'd say it's okay for kids 7 and up though.  Use your best judgment.  Beyond that though, I think the movie is really enjoyable, I recommend it!",1356566400,,1564,4.373702422145329

4786853,5,B005LAII62,"This 5 star review is aimed at the quality of the product purchased. However, the movie itself also deserves 5 stars as a fantastic family movie that is enormously entertaining.

Not all combo packs are created equal. Some offer only blu-ray and DVD. Some also offer a 3D copy. Many will have a digital or Ultraviolet copy included. Not many offer Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet which is what makes this combo pack so great. To purchase each of these individually would be $10-20 each, so the $19.99 price tag is a steal. The digital copy will allow me to add the movie to my iTunes collection, while the UltraViolet copy I can stream through my blu-ray player or Roku wireless receiver.

4786860,2,B005LAII62,"The stop-motion animation is great, very well done technically, but ... this movie is really quite slow, tedious and not that interesting for adults, although it had an interesting start. Turns out there are maybe less than half a dozen funny bits (the best of which was the guy waiting for the vending machine to dispense his chips while Zombies are advancing on him - that was funny). It is really tailored to kids who will be amused by the animation, although they may be scared by the really angry witch girl - those scenes may be too intense for younger kids. But I was quite disappointed in the mostly uninspired action and overall plot. The van chase in the middle was blah. So why did RottenTomatoes (RT) give it an incredible 86% positive rating?

There is actually an interesting message apart from the usual ""don't hate me because I'm different"". Norman pleads with one character not to give in to the same anger and hatred which she experienced. This is interesting in a time where ""peaceful"" and ""tolerant"" folks are publicly calling for death or violence upon people who simply disagree with them - calling for global warming deniers to be executed (or blown up, in a now-famous ad), or for the NRA leadership's heads on pikes, or hinting that corporate CEOs should be assassinated (all just in good fun, of course). Kudos to the writers for daring to include this message, although it probably falls on deaf ears.

This movie is somewhat about the Salem witch trials. You may want to read up on the actual history (not ""pop"" history) of it to be able to answer questions about it. Be aware, though, that Hollywood portrayals of it are usually overblown. Less than 40 were executed for witchcraft in the States, at the height of the hysteria, unlike in Europe, where the calming power of the Church was absent to curb the epidemic. (Yes, it was the Church - ironically, the Spanish Inquisition! - that brought sanity and skepticism to the widespread charges of witchcraft.)

Oh, and true to the stern dictates of Hollywood, there is a gay kid, although you don't find out until the end. Whether this makes it ""family friendly"" is up to you, but there it is. It's not a big part of the movie, though - more like a punch line.

On the whole, for a 86% RT rating, it's quite a disappointment. If you have lower expectations, you may enjoy it more.",1356393600,4,2358,4.607142857142857

4786972,4,B005LAII62,"The main theme of this film is ""the power of forgiveness.""  Now, I myself don't necessarily buy into this oversimplified concept myself, at least in real life.  After all, I don't know how forgiving I would be if I were tried and convicted of a crime that I hadn't committed, and then hanged for it.  Just sayin'.

Not to be too cynical, but that's not the point of the film, of course.  The point is, if someone in Hollywood wants to make a film - supposedly for a younger audience - that filmmaker must make a film that has some nice little Hallmark message inside.  And ""Paranorman"" surely provides that message, buy it or not, and so therefore, it becomes palatable for sugarcoated American audiences that are always craving for something overly sweet.

Am I complaining, you might be tempted to ask?  Well, I'm probably complaining more about American audiences than the film.  After all, it is American audiences that drive filmmaking which creates movies such as this.  So I think that you need to remember this before going in to this seemingly Rudolph-inspired film.  You've got the outcast youngster, bullied because he's different:  that would be Norman instead of Rudolph.  You've got the love interest doe:  the young girl aluded to in the first paragraph (but I can't remember her name) instead of Clarice.  And you've got the bullies:  plenty of those to go around in both movies.

And you just know going in that the bullied kid will make good at the end.  Yes, this film might be just viewed as a retread of so many other kids movies with basically the same plot line, and to a degree that's true.  But it is repackaged in a pretty funny way, ala ""Sixth Sense"" style I guess.  This time with ghosts that aren't really so scary.  They were just scared themselves, at least when they were human.

I did like this film, with a few caveats, as I have discussed.  So I will give this a mild recommendation.  Oh, and please forgive me in advance if I'm wrong.",1356220800,,1970,4.578796561604585

Primary reason I ordered it was Kodi Smitt McFee even if it was just his voice. Secondary reason, sounded  like a novel storyline barring' 'The 6th Sense' premise.
After watching it and only then did I read it was stop motion. Shame is with standard def. and looking for more I never noticed. Plain and simple for general consumption it was ok but I just didn't care, not about the characters, not about the plot, and most certainly not about the stop motion.
---------------------------------
Note Added 4/21/13: I just re-watched Norman again, this time in hi-def on NF and indeed there is more to see when viewing that way. The facial expressions; I couldn't believe how expressive they were and he was. This movie truly does have heart and I did care about him the second time around even his little butterball friend that stuck by him and his wise mouthed sister who finally
realized, though weird at times he was still her brother and it was her job to look after him.
Do forgive my first impression, it definitely may not be a classic but it most certainly is a small gem worth viewing at least once...

Norman's sister asks the older boy whom she has a crush on to go see a movie and he says his boyfriend would love that.  My ten year old son turned to me and said:  She just found out he's gay right!  That one did not get past him.

4787610,5,B005LAII62,"I saw this film in the theater on the premier night in 3-D. The 3D was amazing. Not gimmicky, not just thrown in as an excuse to charge more for admission. AMAZING. I wanted to wait until I actually owned the product which is the home video release before I review. Notice verified purchase. The menu is using Universal Studies generic menu which, I am not crazy about as I like a custom menu. That aside, the BD transfer quality is top notch. You could see all the details Laika studios pays attention too like the pattern in the concrete, and the clothing the characters wore. The video quality is comparable to the theater. I want to get a  3D tv so I can watch movies like this in 3D at home.

Story
A kid from a  small town with a dark history is a medium, he see's dead people. He is also weird and misunderstood by everyone but his friend Neil. The story has great messages about bullying and tolerance. I don't want to spoil it, but I saw it with 4 year and 6 year old. The 6 year got the message, the 4 year old not so much. Mildly scary in some scene, but nothing an intelligent child cannont handle.

Visuals

Laika!, The studio that brought use Coraline and Corpse Bride. This is the best stop motion animation I have ever seen. They were hired by Tim Burton and formed their own studio. I believe the first film to utilize a 3D printer for the film. I read in the Wired article Norman alone has something like 9000 separate faces, with over 300 hand sculpted hairs. Ridiculous attention to detail. They also used an advance process for the 3D shooting multiple frames with a high end Nikkon SLR. At the theater I was blown away by the 3D. I also love the story. A modern take on issues such as bullying and tolerance.

I respect the gay right movement and have supported it 100%.  However, this was not added to the film to educate children or to add substance to the film, it was pure shock value.

4787960,3,B005LAII62,"Decently entertaining with moments of honest hilarity, but falters using an assembly-line script that's been lifted more times than a pair of public gym dumbbells.

Additionally, appropriating the now satirical trope from '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>', young Norman Babcock sees dead people. Well, dead everything, if you include pets and other animals. Pretty sad state of affairs when a once iconic shocker becomes a B-Movie and derivative TV show staple, itself a pathos-laden testament. Unfortunately, this premise also leads to several rather troubling questions which I won't address here.

Norman lives in Massachusetts, a rather notorious state whose past includes the Salem Witch Trials. And it's that history where this tale begins.

Involuntarily designated a town freak, he has to contend with just about every indignity imaginable for someone so young, including the disappointment from his parents who consider him strange beyond your typical quirky kid. Reason? Because he doesn't deny his visions. Norman intentionally chooses to speak with the deceased and only rarely interacts with the living. Such a choice pretty much makes him a very lonely little guy.

And so life, and un-life, goes on.

Until the one day his even more eccentric and infinitely scarier uncle insists on a meeting. He has two things he has to tell Norman - one a warning, the other a revelation. Things are about to change in ways that even the ostracized young man couldn't have imagined, becoming even more bizarre and terrifying.

One step removed from the cracker farm, Uncle Prenderghast explains to his nephew that it is their family's terrible burden and moral responsibility to save the town. With the unwanted ability to see the departed, in their bloodline resides the only power keeping their town's most infamous resident - Agatha The Witch - from resurrecting a legion of the damned and inflicting her revenge against the townfolk who burned her at the stake.

But is that what really happened?

Norman has figure out the truth before Aggie destroys the town and everyone in it.

One minor knock and perhaps it's just me, but save for Norman himself, I don't like the way characters were designed. They seem misshapen and unappealing. Not sure if that makes sense. Obviously these are caricatures, I get that. But look at '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-Transylvania/dp/B0034G4OYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel Transylvania</a>' or '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloudy-With-A-Chance-Of-Meatballs/dp/B00304E5NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs</a>' - one can see their cartoon origins as well, but they're still visually appealing.

The beginning of the movie has a spoof of ""B"" zombie films that was very clever, down to the boom mike making it into the picture. I enjoyed this movie more than the famous Tim Burton productions. While there is nothing wrong in this film per se, there are some things parents might want to know. In one sentence, belief in life after death is equated to belief in astrology. Also the hot guy liked by teen Courtney mentions his boyfriend, shades of ""Call Me Maybe.""

The people who killed the young witch were wrong, they were considered simply afraid. There are no religious elements associated with the witch trial.

The action is s-l-o-w, the story meandering and full of dated pop-culture references, characters somewhat grotesque (not just the zombies) and confined to narrow stereotypes, and the PC/GA burden heavy-handed and tedious.

As a result of his gift he is named as the towns freak and has become an outcast, but he soon learns that his gift for speaking to the dead could be the key to saving his town from the wrath of a vengeful spirit of the towns witch.

Upon looking at the trailers you may think that it's only a kids movie, that is where you are wrong. This world is dark and while there are some comedic moments it is still a very creepy story. Another thing this movie does right is the character, they are all unique and colorful and not one annoyed me, which is extremely rare. If you're going to judge the movie based on the trailers don't, there are plot twists in this movie that you wouldn't see coming in the trailers and one of which near the climax had be crying, yes crying.

What else can I say about this movie? It's fantastic. This movie isn't just for kids it's for adults as well and in all honesty it was really pushing that PG rating.

5 - I really liked/loved it
4 - I liked it/really liked it
3 - Could've been better/worth a look
2 - Just didn't live up to the potential
1 - Simply awful

Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young boy with an unusual gift; he can see and communicate with the spirits of the deceased. This makes him a social outcast to nearly everyone, including members of his own family as they think he's just a weird kid. Although one kid in town thinks what he can do is awesome, portly optimist Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi). One day, Norman is approached by the town crazy, Mr. Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman) who warns Norman of an ancient curse on the town that only Norman can stop. That's all I really wanna say in terms of the plot, as I don't feel like giving away anything else.

This truly is one of the best animated films of 2012; really, it could be one of the best films in general of 2012, and just one of THE BEST animated films. People often forget that animation is not a genre, but a style of filmmaking. So for those that think this movie will be ""too scary"" for kids, then you seriously underestimate how tough kids can be. People also forget that ratings are on movies for a reason. This movie is rated PG (practically a hard PG give certain moments in the film) so you should have a general idea of what age group this movie should fall into. Personally, I think kids who are Norman's age (11 for those that don't know) and maybe even kids a couple years younger. Seriously, I saw tons of more ""intense"" films as a kid and they didn't traumatize me. Think about Disney for a moment; people associate it with a mystical fairy tale land of sweetness and enchantment. But then really think about how intense those movies could be. Snow White (which has the wicked queen being crushed by a rock), Cinderella (who's emotionally and physically abused by her step family), Sleeping Beauty (that features a fight with a dragon and mention to the fires of Hell!), Bambi (where a poor baby deer loses his mother), The Lion King (a lion cub's father trampled to death by a herd of wildebeests), and several others in their catalogue. Disney almost always had some pretty dark undertones. Look at classics like the Secret of NIHM or the Neverending Story. Adults forget that kids are a lot tougher than they thin, and while dark imagery may frighten a bit, once you have a triumphant end all the other bad stuff fades away. ParaNorman is such an example.

This movie hits all the right notes. The animation is AMAZING, the voice casting is fantastic (people will also often forget that voice acting does require some talent and the ability to emote), the look of the movie has a classic horror feel to it, the comedy is funny, the horror at times actually scary, and the drama will tug at you. It also handles death very well and respectfully for the most part. The characters are also great, even some of the smaller ones. A good layer to the whole thing is how Norman interacts with his family. His sister, Courtney (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is your typical teenage girl but not overly annoying, his mother (voiced by Leslie Mann) is your typical protective mother who sticks by her son because that's what a mother does. But of all the family members, the best to me was Norman's father (voiced by Jeff Garlin) because we see that he does genuinely love his son, but at the same time is frustrated that he doesn't understand him. I can relate to that for sure, I think most can because there are those parents who get upset by their kid's strange behavior but they still want to do what they can to show they care even if they don't always go about it the right way. Of course the standout character is Neil because of his optimistic view of everything despite his various problems (like irritable bowel syndrome) and willingness to stick by Norman no matter what. John Goodman stands out too as the crazy old bum. The moment we learn the full story of the curse is simply tragic and if you're not crying from it you'll definitely be crying on the inside.

Personally, I don't get how anyone could rate this below 4 stars. I mean, I get that we all have our tastes and opinions, but seriously, this is by no means a bad movie, especially when compared to the dreck that passes for a lot of kids entertainment these days. This reminds me of movies I watched as a kid, back when people didn't assume kids were fragile and always needed you to hold their hands. So in conclusion, see this movie! It's an essential view for anyone who just loves a great story.",1353974400,5,4608,4.456161137440758

4788265,5,B005LAII62,"""After second viewing of Laika Animation's second film, the people behind Coraline and The PJs (when known under Will Vinton Studios), not only was it even better but I experienced and appreciated even more the highly intricate animation process, designs, and storyline. Even before seeing it a second time, this is by far the best film I've seen in 2012 along with Tim Burton film Frankenweenie in terms of best animated works. It is almost like 2009 where this year brought forth many interesting works on the table. So far, the best moments to recollect are the homage to 80s horror-comedies and the more subtle, mellow moments that go against the mania and frenzy shown during the riot and witch-encounter scenes. Eerie, imaginative, and audacious (in terms of horror themes and perceptions of death and its edgy Goonies-esque humour with its widely-debated jock Mitch). If ever in doubt about the field of animation, don't be harmed to give ParaNorman a try for your DVD or rental collection. You won't be disappointed, unless if you're prudish or ultra-conservative or against the so-called notion of ""kid's entertainment."" Midnight film at best with Gremlins, Shaun of the Dead, or Howard the Duck on too.""

*ParaNorman (2012)- 4/5

ParaNorman is a stop-motion comedy thriller from animation company, LAIKA. A boy named Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is able to see and speak with the dead. Nobody in town believes that he can see and hear ghosts, and kids make fun of his gift. Norman makes a friend, Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi), who believes Norman can see and speak with ghosts. The two boys are confronted by Norman's Uncle, Mr. Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman), who tells Norman that he must be the one who has to save the town from the witch by reading a book at the witches grave.

ParaNorman has a very unique look throughout the film, and when you finally see those zombies, you may not be scared at all by them. Human characters look oddly shaped and just plain weird, which makes the zombies seem less scary, which I'm fine with as kids may not be so scared of them when they finally see them. The dialogue is very well written and both kids and adults will be pleased, although, ParaNorman is not a movie that I would take my child to go see. There are many stereotypes portrayed throughout the film, and the script is geared a little bit more toward adult humor. ParaNorman doesn't have the best storyline, but that's okay as I was just waiting for the next great dialogue line.

The visuals are wonderful, the dialogue is fantastic, but there's something lacking in the film that makes me want to watch this another time; overall it's the poor storyline. Most kids and adults will like ParaNorman, but in my opinion, adults should be aware that it's a more adult oriented movie. I saw ParaNorman in 2D, and since it's already a dark movie with not much noticeable 3D parts, I would suggest sticking with 2D. I can't recommend ParaNorman enough; it's a good film that deserves a highly recommended 'rent.'",1353628800,4,1870,4.66060606060606

More lies produced to inculcate our children, from the father of lies. The Bible tells us that when we ""speak to the dead"" we actually talk to demons/fallen angels. Don't be deceived. Leviticus 19:31 is but one of many instructions against necromancy. ""Do not turn to mediums or spiritists; do not seek them out to be defiled by them.

4788333,4,B005LAII62,"This film was released in late summer.  While watching it I kept wondering why this film wasn't released for Halloween.  There are haunted houses, ghosts, witches,  etc.  It's not a summer teen slasher film, but an animated family movie that involves the ""6th Sense"" plot of a boy seeing and talking to dead people.  Paranorman has the stereotypical characters of the loving but disagreable parents, the school bully, and the wayward kid who befriends Norman because he is also ""unusual"".  He also has a drunken estranged uncle who knows what Norman is going through and before he becomes a ghost himself, tells Norman how it all started and how he can solve his problem.

For fans of animation or horror films, this movie will satisfy. The movie didn't seem that much of a family movie since it involves an animated car chase crash (which everyone survives) and a very realistic scary looking whirling skystorm. It is funny enough to keep audiences entertained with the over-exaggerated expression and body proportions of the animated characters.  Norman is just that kid you think is weird but still know there's a ""reason"" behind his weirdness.  Paranorman is a pretty good horror film that just happens to be an animated feature.",1351382400,4,1233,4.946601941747573
4788334,5,B005LAII62,"Norman Babcock has a lot of friends, unfortunately they are all dead. He has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts of people and animals and because of that he is considered weird at school and even to his own family. He is bullied at school because of his abilities and his only friend is Neil who is an overweight boy who is also bullied.

The small town of Blithe Hollow, where they live, has quite a history that includes the execution of a witch 300 years ago. Norman begins having visions of the event while he is rehearsing for the school play in which he has a role. He is also approached by a wild looking man who claims to also see the dead and tells Norman that he is the only one that can stop the return of the witch's curse including the attack of 7 zombies on the town.....

We took our grandson to see this movie and he loved it. Tonight he is going to a haunted house with his father and so it is a big scary day for him. This is a very good movie and it is entertaining for many age groups. The graphics and storyline were well written and my wife and I enjoyed it as much as our grandson.

The movie is rated PG and some parts are pretty intense. It may be too much for younger or sensitive children. At the end of the film one of the teenage characters reveals that he has a boyfriend and several people have taken offense to that being in a cartoon story. If that is offensive to you or you do not want to possibly be asked the question on the way home of why Mitch has a boyfriend, you might want to avoid this movie.

It is a good story line about bullying and how a couple of young boys save the town from a paranormal event. It can be scary to some children so make your viewing choice wisely. We enjoyed the movie and we all gave it 5 stars.",1351209600,,1776,4.065714285714286
4788335,3,B005LAII62,"After seeing ParaNorman yesterday at the base theater, I have to say that I'm kind of surprised that there is such a controversy over the ""message"" of this movie.  First, I don't think there was any type of nefarious message; the only message I gleaned from watching this movie was the usual ""don't judge others"" and ""we're all different, we're all special"" type of thing.  Those are messages with which I agree.  In fact, my husband and I instilled what ethics, morals and beliefs we felt were appropriate for our children with the hope that they would be productive members of society and independent thinkers.  Doing such has made us confident that they are able to assess different situations and make good decisions on their own, regardless of what movies they watch, or books they read, etc.

In other words, we're pretty confident that they can watch a children's movie and still retain what we've taught them.

That said, I thought the movie was pretty good.  I was kind of creeped out at some of the animation, which was very unique and well done.  Some of the storyline was a bit dark, but I agree with other reviewers who noted that the darkness probably went over the heads of most children.  Also, at this point I should admit that I was initially hesitant to take our daughter because I thought the premise had something to do with demons, but after looking up reviews and listening to my husband, I was wrong.  My husband will now probably print out that last sentence and frame it, especially since he's the one who was... not... wrong.  Erg!!

Anyway, moving swiftly along --

In my opinion, ""ParaNorman"" is a Halloween-type children's movie, and was enjoyable.  I liked that Norman was able to overcome his own fear and do the right thing, in the face of majority opposition.  Courage is always an asset.

I also laughed quite a bit at the jokes and writing, which was definitely rated PG.  The children in the theater reacted well to the funny parts, and you could hear a pin drop whenever there was a dramatic crescendo.  No one wept with terror, and there were children from infant-teen age range present.  Our 11-year-old daughter thought it was great, and by the time we hit the parking lot she had moved on to begging for ice cream.

ParaNorman had great animation, good writing, and was entertaining.  Recommended to others with the caveat that there may be aspects that some find offensive, so research prior to seeing is also recommended.

4788336,4,B005LAII62,"Did you fit in growing up? Did you have lots of friends, play sports, and go to parties? What about seeing dead people? Did you do that? Probably not. Norman Babcock, on the other hand, sees and speaks to dead people all the time.

  Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an outcast at school and an embarrassment to his family, thanks largely to his ""gift"". Norman's father Perry (voiced by Jeff Garlin) doesn't believe Norman is talking to anyone and makes no effort to explore the possibility that he's wrong. Norman's mother, Sandra (voiced by Leslie Mann) is more tolerant but, by no means, a believer. Courtney, Norman's older sister (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is a cheerleader who thinks Norman's a freak and has very few thoughts on any meaningful subjects. The only companions our main character has are his deceased grandmother (voiced by Elaine Stritch), other ghosts in town and a fellow student named Neil (voice by Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied because, among other things, he is overweight. The town they all live in is named Blithe Hollow and it is best known for its execution of a witch 300 years ago. While rehearsing a play on the subject, Norman has a vision of the past and being pursued by an angry mob. Not long after that, Norman and Neil are confronted by Norman's estranged uncle, Mr. Penderghast, (voiced by John Goodman) who tells them that they must perform a ritual that evening to prevent the dead rising from the gave that evening.

  I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. Yes, the notion of a child who can ""see dead people"" is right out of The Sixth Sense but that's where the similarities end. Norman accepts his abilities, in spite of the scorn he receives as a result. Another difference between Norman and the character portrayed by Haley Joel Osment is that Norman is a very optimistic, upbeat; individual who just doesn't have any friends. The supporting cast is chock-full of talented people who add to the story.

It encourages diversity and acceptance.  I pray for the day that a movie intended to harbor good will and positivity such as this one will not be jeered at for having a gay character but just be accepted as nothing to be surprised at; the character will be looked at as just like everyone else, because that is what they are; just like everyone else.

The erroneous and disturbing review purporting a non existent ""gay agenda"" etc.  is particularly disturbing and the ignorance blinding.  This is a family movie with a good message, the only agenda that I see is those, even those who should know better, attempting to squash and silence those who are for equality, acceptance, civil rights for all.",1349913600,10,882,4.585987261146497

But it still lets us know that things aren't all hopeless and things really can improve.

The characters are freshly honest and real in the way they act towards each other, and the twists and turns the film goes through are thrilling and tense and makes the audience stop and thing. The only true bad guy in the film is society and what it can do to otherwise good people.

4788340,5,B005LAII62,"What a great movie. This film reminded me of the kid horror films of the 80s. Movies like monsters squad and lost boys. It also has a goonies and ET feel as well. Of course most people are going to be freaked out because there are curse words and real scares just like the movies I grew up on(rewatch some of your favorite 80s kids movies you will be surprised at the level of violence and curse words that was in a lot of them). The movie is more for older kids if you have a 12 year old nephew he is probably going to love it. I took my 6 year old and she was scared during a few scenes, especially towards the end of the movie but she also really enjoyed the movie. The film has a strong anti bullying theme throughout as well as a diversity is good theme, which will probably make certain segments of the population uncomfortable. Also there is a gay character so if you are homophobic you should probably skip the film. Also for film geeks without kids I would highly recommend the movie as you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it as well. Overall a great movie and I can't wait to check out the Blu Ray, hopefully it is full of making of featurettes.

4788481,3,B005LAII62,"IF you've ever had the misfortune of stumbling over one of my reviews, you'd know what an animation geek I am, particularly stop-motion animation as well as anything scary.  I'm all for any film that pushes the art in order to preserve its existence in this CGI world of entertainment.  Laika Studio has been the standard bearer of feature film stop-motion since being contracted to work on ""Corpse Bride"" (2005), so I'm pretty much in favor of them making any film.  However and sadly, ""ParaNorman"" misses the mark on some key attributes.  Let me dismember the details.

-HOW ABOUT THAT CREEPY STOP-MOTION?
I've always said that if you want something to look creepy, use stop-motion.  Not surprisingly, most recent stop-motion films have had dark and scary themes (""Corpse Bride"", ""Coralline"").  Though Laika has yet to match the quality of their work in ""Corpse Bride"", they do a very good job of bringing their dolls to life.  They've also pioneered the melding of computer graphics with stop-motion to great effect.  This makes ""ParaNorman"" a visual treat that animation geeks can enjoy despite the other problems this film has.

-BUILDING CHARACTER
Without listing the entire roster of characters, it should suffice to say that lack of good characters is not a problem for this film.  These are characters that are easy to identify with and to invest emotions in.  Despite the relatively large number of characters in ""ParaNorman"", they all are developed appropriately enough for their roles in the film.  Some of them I thought were great while others, though well developed, just didn't do much to excite me.  A well developed character will only count for so much if the story doesn't give them something interesting to do.

-A STORY WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCES
Unlike ""Coraline"", ""ParaNorman"" lacks a cohesive and riveting story.  The story often trailed off task or mood.  Sometimes the humor seemed out of context with events taking place.  Sometimes things got very serious when maybe they should have been lighter.  And all along I had this feeling that I'd seen most of this before.  In fact, ""ParaNorman"" was disappointingly unoriginal and derivative.  Kids who see dead people, misunderstood Zombies, and a mob of the living who does the misunderstanding are hardly fresh concepts.  To make matters worse, Laika really failed to decide on who its audience was going to be.  This is probably too scary for many young children yet not scary enough to satisfy older kids.  A Stop-motion kid film might not be the best place to discuss concepts of human sexuality either.  I think the fact that this has been a disappointment at the box office is testimony to that.  That's bad news for us stop-motion fans.

-WILL THIS WITCH FLOAT?
It's hard for me to say bad things about a stop-motion feature film.  I'm such a huge fan of the art form.  That's why it was so disappointing to leave the theater with my family unsatisfied.  I loved a lot about this film.  Some moments were highly memorable and entertaining.  The animation was pretty darn good.  The subject matter was right up my alley.  But when you invest so much time and effort into an art form that stands on the brink of obsoleteness (heaven forbid!), shouldn't you take the time to get the story right?  Shouldn't you be just a little cognizant of who your audience is going to be?  I really was excited to see this film.  It saddens me that Laika kind of blew it.

4788484,3,B005LAII62,"""Paranorman"" offers a fair evening's amusement, but not a lot more. It's easy to empathize with him: a nice enough kid but with a difference that sets him apart, has to deal with knuckle-dragging bullies, has lots of bad hair days.

Then, the uncle that no one talks about finds him. It turns out that Norman's ""I see dead people"" knack runs in the family, and has imposed a unique duty on the people that share his talent. The undle dies before passing the whole secret along, though, in a hilarious scene in the school boys' room. Norman misses his cue n carrying out the task, and ancient evil arises from the grave.

It turns out to be more angry (with reason) and misunderstood than really evil, though. As you might expect, he gets it all sorted out in the end and becomes cooler than the cool kids ever were.

The animation gets high marks, and the characters (especially his sister) are cleverly drawn. There's not a lot under the surface, but only the grown-ups watching will care, and the moview really wasn't for them - for us.

Seriously, Paranorman was a great film. I don't know where to start. First, there story was great, not cliche at all.  Yes, it had your archetypal character types like the ""cheer leader"", the ""jock"" and the ""bully""; but it took those archetypes and gave them a beautiful and witty twist.
This is not only a story about a kid who can see ghosts, it is so much more. It's a story about a kid who is bullied for being different, who doesn't quite fit in. But he's not a depressed about it, he doesn't act like a victim or wallow in self-pity. He moves on and even becomes something greater saving everyone.

This movie teaches us that it's wrong to pick on others for being different and the extent of the pain and suffering that we can cause by being close minded and scared. I makes me incredibly sad to come across people who bad-mouth this movie for the extent of its open mindedness.

Many people can relate to the themes mentioned in this movie. Children and adults alike.
