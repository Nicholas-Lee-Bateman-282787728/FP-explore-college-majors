8248850,3,B00132D7UO,"Physical quality of product is fine, but the show is pretty bad. It all depends on taste. If you like bad action flicks, it is quite fantastic. Lance Henriksen is the only guy that can act in the show, and I think he gives up on that halfway through. I laughed hard all the way through, but the rest of the family hated it.",1369612800,,323,4.0625
8248851,1,B00132D7UO,"Okay, so this film is just plain BAD. The acting was uneven although the worst actor by far is the hair dresser looking guy, Grubman, played by D. C. Douglas! Ugh. The character, Colin, was hard to understand because even though he was playing an American sailor, he is a British actor, Gary Stretch. And lastly the story makes very little sense with an ending that is totally not clear and/or hardly understandable! Oh, the cinematography is the best thing about the picture... big deal.",1363737600,2,488,4.752941176470588
8248852,1,B00132D7UO,"Black Ops is yet another ghost ship movie. It seems the SS Lane Victory had a role in capturing and torturing a psychic Nazi during World War II.  The ship has been reactivated and deployed in the Persian Gulf as a sort of floating prison hulk. When the Victory falls radio silent, a black ops team is sent to investigate, led by Col. John Willets (Lance Henriksen). On board, they discover two survivors, John's son Colin (Gary Stretch) and the captured terrorist Fahdawi (Lee Majdoub). Did the terrorist do it?  Is Colin somehow involved?

SHIP ALERT: Not really.  Director Roel Reine doesn't seem interested in anything other than filming the movie on a ship.  They were lucky enough to film on a real battleship from World War II. That's a great reason to make a movie, right?

To make up for the lack of plot, Black Ops, or Deadwater, or whatever the heck the film wants to be called, throws everything in but the kitchen sink. There's a team of ghostbusters who are secretly sent to investigate the psychic phenomena, the chick in the tight black tank top who insists on taking a long hot shower, and terrorist with a dark secret.

Black Ops' biggest challenge is that it can't muster up the energy to create any uncertainty.  It's obvious who's going to survive, who's going to die, and who is the real bad guy. There's some father/son angst, some military posturing, the jerk with the secret mission, blah blah and then NAZIS!

If only Black Ops had embraced its Nazi heritage. This movie was originally called Nazi Dawn.  And if you're looking for inspirational Nazi hokum (like say, using the Karotechia in your Delta Green tabletop role-playing campaign) then there are some nuggets to be found here.  Let me save you the trouble.  Depending on which conspiracy theory you ascribe to, Nazis were responsible for cultivating psychic powers that eventually filtered their way to America via PROJECT PAPERCLIP.  If you're not familiar with the origins of Nazi mysticism, not much of Black Ops makes sense.

Black Ops takes itself far too seriously to be campy, cares far too little about important details to be taken seriously, and basically looks and feels like a low budget production shamelessly using its set as a pretense for a movie. The only ghosts on this ship are the actors milling aimlessly through it.",1295049600,,2322,4.7725
8248853,1,B00132D7UO,"Okay. I am not sure what this was about. I do, however, take exception to the first review. Lance Henriksen is not quite a ""no-name"" actor, having been in the casts of Dog Day Afternoon, Aliens, and The Terminator. That said, his imdb resume should be a clue that the ""supernatural"" might be involved.

The problem with this flick is that it doesn't know it's audience: scifi, horror, war, supernatural? It tries to appeal to many and ends appealing to few. Standard crew, including the token female, runs around the ship and each is killed/disposed of in the usual fashion.

This is a movie you watch w/friends in order to laugh at how much they got wrong (or, to take a drink everytime they do something we've seen a million times before).

Don't buy it, don't rent it, wait for it to come on cable and if you have a little time to waste, it won't kill you to watch this...then again, it adds nothing to any of the canons it tries so hard to emulate.",1261353600,5,952,4.3977272727272725
8248854,1,B00132D7UO,"Blackops, a thriller with a no-name cast is perhaps one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen.

The premise is that a re-commissioned ship from World War II being used off the coast of Iraq for ""black ops"" or completely off the books, interrogations, looses contact with U.S. military forces. A U.S. Marine task force along with two ""scientists"" are sent to investigate the cause. When they arrive, they find nearly everyone on the ship dead. The cause? A terrorist named Fadawi, or is it?

What at the outset seems like a run of the mill average post-9/11 movie about terrorism and Iraq turns into a supernatural horror film focusing on fictional experiments done by the Nazis during World War II. There is a supernatural entity aboard the ship, created by the Nazis. One that the U.S. government wants to ""capture"" and use for their own anti-terrorism purposes. Of course, in post-Iraq invasion Hollywood, the U.S. government has to be portrayed as sinister and sending their soldiers to die in a mission they didn't inform them of the details, and will use their deaths to justify another invasion in the Middle East.

At an hour and a half, this movie might be ok if a horror fan is really bored, and if you're predisposed to hate the U.S. government and U.S. military. But otherwise I just can't recommend it. Too many plot elements are haphazardly explained, or just happen and the explanation is left out entirely. The movie also seems to live on gore, as the majority of the killings, and the entire first quarter of the movie when the Marines are sweeping the ship looking for survivors, is absolutely needlessly bloody.

The back of the DVD case does not mention this movie has anything to do with the supernatural or that it's, essentially, a horror film. If it had, I would have skipped it entirely.

In short, this movie is just awful.",1241827200,7,1849,4.712074303405573
8248855,1,B00132D7UO,"The synopsis said Marines were sent in when actually it was SEALS. During a tense moment one SEAL tells another to ""get a grip, soldier"" No Navy seaman would dare call another one ""soldier"".
The plot was weak. The story was silly and the sound was so low I couldn't make out some of the dialog. The main character was too old to be a SEAL and too disorganized.
On the whole this movie was a major disappointment.",1211500800,6,412,4.294871794871795
