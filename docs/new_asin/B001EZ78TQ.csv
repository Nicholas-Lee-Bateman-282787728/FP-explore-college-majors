8300067,5,B001EZ78TQ,I saw this show on TV a long time ago and always wanted to own the DVD. It was difficult to find since searches always find live music for all bands. Finally I went to the bans's web site and found the name of the DVD. You can buy it from their web site for $15.99!,1485907200,,265,3.75
