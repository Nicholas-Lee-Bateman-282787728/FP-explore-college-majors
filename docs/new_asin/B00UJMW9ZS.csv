7046650,5,B00UJMW9ZS,This is one of Bette's finest roles and I am sure the blu ray will make it even more enjoyable.  Whether it is a young boozy Ronnie Reagan or Bogie with an Irish brogue everyone is fine.  Geraldine Fitzgerald does well too.  Bette was probably set for a 3rd Oscar but then GONE WITH THE WIND  was released.  Oh those wonderful black and white movies!,1432598400,6,350,4.323076923076923
7046651,5,B00UJMW9ZS,"If anyone else had made this film it would come across as a maudlin overwrought tv movie of the week. But put the great Bette Davis in it and you have an entirely different film result. This was made in her prime. She plays rich socialite Judith Traheme who discovers she has an inoperable brain tumor. As someone who was born with a silver spoon and to whom everything came on a platter, she was never prepared for this kind of news. The question becomes how will she choose to finish out her life? Can she even accept it is ending? Can she experience any happiness, any love, whatsoever as she moves towards death? Davis is formidable in the part and I would hate to be the actress who tries to remake this. If you are woefully behind on these earlier film stars, you need to discover one of the very best from the Old Hollywood.",1432080000,11,831,4.333333333333333

8707105,5,B00UJMW9ZS,"There is something about women that requires them to cry now and then for their well being. Do not ask me what it is. Viewing this movie periodically seems to accomplish that purpose.

It evidently was the custom to withhold information from each other and be stoic about medical problems. If you tried that today you would be sued and there would be no movie.

However if this one works for her then you are ready for the big time ""Now Voyager (1942)"" where they say ""Don't ask for the moon--we have the stars""

Of course if you just like stoic doctors then watch ""People Will Talk (1951)"" with Cary Grant",1501113600,,606,4.441441441441442

8707111,3,B00UJMW9ZS,"Hollywood must still like films about characters with incurable diseases judging by the recent Oscar winning roles by Eddie Redmayne in ""The Theory of Everything""(Best Actor) and Julianne Moore in ""Still Alice""(Best Actress) and although Bette Davis' role as Judith Traherne in ""Dark Victory"" did not win her the Oscar, it is certainly one of roles that she is most remembered for. Warner's has now brought this sentimental melodrama to Blu-ray for the first time and viewers may be disappointed with the results. Despite reports to the contrary, this Blu-ray was not sourced off of the original negative(if it even exists) and appears to be taken from less than stellar film elements. Although it's a slight improvement over the 2005 Standard DVD, Warner's has given it a low Bitrate(20.94) with mixed results. Despite the upgrade, this new Blu-ray appears much darker than the standard DVD with grain very prominent. There is a softness to the picture and many of the close-ups look fuzzy. Image quality during the course of the film is not consistent with some being overly soft while others are crystal clear. Despite that, the film has been cleaned up for it's Blu-ray debut and is free of any vertical lines, dirt, specks,  torn or damaged frames.  The story itself has become one of the classics since it's original release in 1939. This is a Bette Davis film from start to finish and she is at the top of her game. Her scenes with co-star George Brent(this was their eighth film together) are very believable and touching and the two of them have chemistry together. They get great support from Humphrey Bogart, Cora Witherspoon, Henry Travers and Geraldine Fitzgerald. Even Ronald Reagan shows up as a drunken playboy! The Audio(English DTS-HA MA 1.0 and Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0) has been cleaned up too and is free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pop, etc.) ""Dark Victory"" is 104 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, Spanish and French. Special Features include: commentaries by film historian James Urisini and film critic Paul Clinton, the ""Old Hickory"" short, a ""Dark Victory"" featurette, vintage newsreels, a WB cartoon, the Lux Radio broadcast with Bette Davis and Spencer Tracy and the theatrical trailer. The Blu-ray itself is housed in one of those eco-cutout cases so anyone purchasing this new Blu-ray may want to switch to a more sturdy Blu-ray case for added protection. ""Dark Victory"" is one of the classic melodramas from Hollywood's Golden Era and although Warner's new Blu-ray is not stellar, it certainly comes recommended for fans of the film and Bette Davis.",1435104000,13,2630,5.057603686635945
