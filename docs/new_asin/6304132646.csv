798562,3,6304132646,"My daughter (17 months) really loves Elmo's World.  So we bought more Seasame Street Dvds hoping she would enjoy them.  Unfortunely, this one didn't capture her interest.  This might be better for an older child who is interested in learning about other cultures.",1100131200,2,263,5.069767441860465

If you are looking for other DVDs and VHS set around the same time, when Big Bird and Snuffy were main characters and Elmo was a supporting one, when Telly was still more worried about everything, Linda  taught sign language, and Barkley was still the unofficial SS mascot, a few others are:  Follow That Bird, Put Down The Ducky, Don't Eat The Pictures, and Christmas Eve On SS :)",1227484800,2,591,4.297297297297297
7863583,5,6304132646,"One of our most important Christmas traditions is getting out ""A Monster's New Year's Eve Party"" -- the old name for this DVD. My almost 16-year-old LOVES this; as we watch it every year, he says ""I love this song"" and ""I always wanted one of those hammers for the rice"" etc. I am buying the DVD now because I'm afraid our old VHS tape is going to break eventually. The story takes Sesame Street characters to visit different cultures around the world and learn how they celebrate the new year; it's very sweet and a wonderful opportunity for kids to experience different cultures. Highly recommended!",1198627200,,601,4.679245283018868
7863584,4,6304132646,my 2yr old really loves sesame street but this video is probatly best for kids 3 and up since theres alot of talking so ill just put away for later but still a great choice to teach children about how other countrys celebrate new years,1171324800,,235,4.2444444444444445
