2325092,5,B0009VI4DK,"I actually thought that I purchased the cd, but I'm glad for the dvd.  It's great. My error was to my advantage. I really feel ushered into the presence of the Lord!! It's the next best thing to being there in the anointed service.",1163030400,4,231,4.25
2325093,5,B0009VI4DK,"This DVD has some really great songs on it.  It starts out with some upbeat praise songs like ""Lift Him Up"", ""Glorious"", and ""Mighty God"".  Then it slows down to ""Sing"", ""Because of Who You Are"", Say the Name"", ""Jesus Medley"", and ""God is Here"" (my favorite).  The concert is topped off with ""I Know the Plans"", Your Latter Will Be Greater"", ""New Season"" with Israel Houghton, and ""Shout"". There is absolutely no filler, every song is a hit and worth every penny of the DVD.  You must buy this DVD, it is good music for prayer, Bible reading, and even to hype yourself up with.",1136592000,10,577,4.415094339622642
2325094,5,B0009VI4DK,"Honestly, I'd never heard of this lady in my life.  My father mailed this cd to me and it was AWESOME from the 1st track to the last.  I don't know why it's taken two years for me to hear such an anointed woman.  I am waiting on her next album and it has to be soon.",1127952000,,266,3.6315789473684212
2325095,5,B0009VI4DK,"Every song on this album is incredible.  My church sings most of the songs on this DVD, so when I saw the DVD I liked the whole thing.  The worship songs are really deep, the praise songs are really hype.  The only bad thing I can complain about is that the video quality is not as good as it could have been.  It is very good quality, but not as fine as most DVDs.  This, however, doesn't really take away from the worship experience.  Buy this DVD!",1126137600,,450,4.114942528735632
