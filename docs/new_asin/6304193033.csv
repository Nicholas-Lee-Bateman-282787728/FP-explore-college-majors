7865537,1,6304193033,"Surely with past intellects like William F. Buckley and venerable political leaders like Barry Goldwater to compare him to, shouldn't Rush have been dismissed years ago. Where are the compassionate conservatives we were told about who could still remain true to their cause while still being reasonable and rational and occasionally even bi-partisan.

Instead we're treated to this egotistical, pill-popping hypocrite holding forth nationally on a daily basis mostly to a crowd of sycophantic ""ditto-heads"" who are apparently utterly incapable of any independent critical thinking about any significant issue that he opposes.

Just how did this draft-ducking college drop- out wind up becoming the spokesman for the conservative movement in the U.S.  anyway?

Since Obama's self-disclosed youthful indiscretions were fair game for Rush's ire I wondered why for instance in his youth, Rush (this future keeper of the flame of ""American values""), wasn't himself fighting heroically in the front lines in Viet Nam? What could have possibly impeded this ""Uber-American"" from doing his patriotic duty and serving his country in uniform (instead of meekly accepting a deferment) like a draft card burning leftie during America's greatest time of need?

For such an unapologetic Hawk his own glaring lack of personal military experience does  not however deter him at all from denigrating the military records of other's he opposed like John Kerry or John Murtha who had chosen to fight rather than stay safely out of harms way like he did.
  It's sadly ironic that John McCain was the only Republican in recent memory that has actually seen any combat and they don't even regard him as a true conservative!
Rush remains adamantly bullish on America's right to prosecute a war to protect her vital national interests as long as he himself doesn't actually have to fight in it!

However Put Rush in front of a live microphone now w/ four hours to kill and you have a real pit bull on your hands! He's even courageous make sadistic fun of veterans who now oppose the war as well as the disabled, foreigners, minorities and woman or anyone else who disagrees with him.

Not that he really likes to debate in close combat mind you! No, it seems Rush prefers the wide-open spaces of an empty studio, unencumbered by annoying guests with contrary points of view armed with facts and figures that would tend to undermine his sweeping allegations and assessments. Yes apparently by his own estimate and despite any formal education in these fields's his own deep theoretical and working knowledge of the economy, history, civilianization and history has prepared him to weigh in on almost any topic with an abiding confidence of the rightness of his cause and without any need for further discussion.  He is convinced that he truly has a talent he only half-jokingly refers to as being ""On loan from God""

Funny however regardless of the topic, it always gets back to a showdown with those damn ""liberals""!

We're also now reminded on an almost hourly basis that he isn't even Republican (He's a Conservative and independent) so he can't possibly bear any direct responsibility for this miserable showing in the election. According to him they just didn't heed his advice well enough!

Now it seems the laser-beam like acuity of Rush's post election analysis seems to be focusing the blame for the Republican's abysmal showing primarily on John McCain's shoulders alone. Apparently he just wasn't ""conservative"" enough!

According to the combined wisdom of the right -winged radio brain trust led by Rush in lock step, McCain should've just kept hammering away on the duel points of Obama's connection to his ex-pastor's anti-Americanism and Bill Ayers unrepentant radical past, regardless of there being no evidence that these issues ever gained any traction with the voter's.

The fact that most voters were understandably pre-occupied with the economy and John McCain's flat-footed stunt to ""suspend"" his campaign and rush back to Washington  and then sit and do nothing did little to impress the voters never got the scathing sarcasm he reserves exclusively for Democrats.

Don't dare diss Governor. Palin, however or you're libel get an earful from Rush, regardless of what most exit polls seem to indicate about the voter's skepticism about her readiness to be Commander-in-chief. He simply brushes aside her negative exit polling numbers as the work of the left-leaning ""drive by"" media. According to Rush the always center-right leaning American people are apparently also very easily duped. Thank God for Rush-the one true voice of truth crying out in the wilderness!

Rush must also fancy himself as some sort of fiendishly clever political wit with such notable characterizations as the misogynistic ""Fema-Nazi's"". However once he's coined such a term, he'll also usually beat it to death w/ constant repletion to a point of almost inducing physical illness.  He's now snidely characterizing President-elect Obama as a ""Chicago street thug"" and flatly rejects any appeal for unity or even giving the new President a chance to prove himself. Why wait, he's apparently already geared up to oppose him at every turn.

Rush's recent inept attempt's to use Obama's off-handed remark to Joe the plumber to ""share the wealth"" as positive proof that Obama is really a card-carrying socialist would  be laughable until you realize most of his devoted listener's require no further evidence either!

The fact that the up until two years ago the  Republican Party had the Presidency and a majority in both houses of Congress for the preceding six years and therefore must bare most the responsibility for our current mess is also completely lost on them.

Sadly in the end it's probably just going to help his ratings. This is because most people tune in his daily rants precisely because they are more like a rowdy sports call-in radio show than a thoughtful (i.e. dull) political analysis like the centrist-left NPR.

Like most traditional demagogy, Rush's real strength lies in his ability to make simple distinctions from complex issues for his audience requiring little thought and even less action on their part. They then see can see themselves as the overburdened and underappreciated victims of the elitist leftist do-gooders attempting to assist the un-deserving poor at their expense. This mostly white beleaguered middle class are then in need of economic justice themselves not higher taxes according to Rush.

Rush's enemy's lists are then conveniently populated by two dimensional characterizations, without any redeeming genuine human traits or values in common with decent American folks. They are therefore much easier to utterly despise and ridicule and there is no point trying to negotiate with them either. It's just a sign of weakness.

Remember the ""conservative"" agenda Rush champions w/o reservation has also opposed every progressive and enlightened idea put forth in the last 100 years.
They included Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, Child labor laws, Civil rights, Integration, Woman's rights, reproductive rights, gay rights, environmentalism, conservation, alternative energy, anti-trust legislation, the UN, peace-keeping, consumer rights and now individual privacy rights.(perhaps w/ the notable exception of a patient's right to confidentiality regarding medical records and the medications prescribed)",1226016000,2,7429,5.272881355932204

This movie is very clever, witty, and humorous.  I have watched it several times and can't seem to get enough of it!  Thanks Rush for all you do and for all the laughs you have provided me and my family with!",1217030400,,407,4.17948717948718

Having said that, I simply MUST respond to a recent reviewer who said ""I think this book is only funny to those who consume mass quanities (sic) of oxycontin"" and ""...I think he might have been high while writing this book and I wasn't while reading it.""  Ummm.....Hello?  You READ a VHS tape?  You didn't bother to watch it before reviewing it?  Probably the most confusing ""book"" in the world....can't seem to get the pages open.  I guess Rush was right.  Sometimes you really do just gotta laugh.",1079136000,8,769,4.554744525547445

it is just that i think he might have been high while writing this book and i wasn't while reading it.
that can present a problem.
i am glad he is better now.  it would be sad to see him pull it together and then have to go to prison.

7865541,5,6304193033,"In this Video Rush Limbaugh hosts a series of clips from his television series. He plays videos of liberals making fools of themselves, congressmen putting people to sleep, and some of the funnier moments from his TV series.
Firstly, any ditto head is going to love this tape and most conservatives are going to enjoy this tape as well. However, most liberals are going to be hard pressed to get anything out of this. Limbaugh is confrontational, and seeing liberal icons make fools of themselves isn't going to switch anyone's political attitudes. However, I'm not a liberal, so I'm going to recommend buying this volume, it's hilarious.
Also added at the end of the ""deluxe"" edition is ""Rush Limbaugh's American Dream"" which is a heartfelt half hour, but is a little drawn out.
This is a video you can watch over and over, and it never really gets old.",1051401600,10,854,4.738255033557047
