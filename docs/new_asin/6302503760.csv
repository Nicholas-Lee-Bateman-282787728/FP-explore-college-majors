I've loved this cartoon since childhood and have finally  bought my own copy. I hope I don't wear the tape out before I have children  of my own to share it with.",947116800,6,315,4.473684210526316

486878,3,6302503760,"Apparently, I am trying to catch up on a couple more of the Claymation holiday specials I missed as a kid this year.  When I found Rudolph's Shiny New Year on TV the other night, I had to give it a try.  It had some great elements to it, but it doesnt quite hold together.

Rudolph (voiced by Billie Mae Richards) and Santa (Paul Frees) are just back from that famous foggy Christmas Eve when Santa gets a message from Father Time (Red Skelton).  It seems Happy, the New Years Baby, has run away.  He has incredibly large ears, and people cant help but laugh at them when they see them, and he has taken offense at that.  If he isn't back by the stroke of twelve, the world will be stuck in a time loop on December 31st.

There is one creature who is happy about this possibility  Eon (Paul Frees again), a vulture who is set to be replaced in the new year.  So while Rudolph conducts a search of some magically time frozen islands, Eon is right there hoping to snatch baby Happy first.  Who will win?  Will they even find Happy or just keep missing him?

There is the potential for a good story in here, but I think the desire to stretch it out to an hour (less commercials) is what did them in.  These islands that Rudolph searches are where each year goes to retire, and their island is frozen in their year.  That was lots of fun, and I had a blast visiting those different islands.  Yet, can you tell me why we redid the Three Bears with Happy as Goldilocks?  Yep, makes no sense.  There were another couple of twists along the way there also felt like they were just there to expand the running time of the story.

Not to mention, why couldn't Rudolph fly?  He had to get help from other animals along the way.  Mind you, they had punny names, and I liked them, but I never did understand why Rudolph couldn't just fly where he needed to go by himself.  Again, I think it had to do with expanding the story.

None of this is the fault of the voice cast.  While a bit childish sounding, they certainly fit the parts well, and I liked how the brought the characters to life.  And considering the audience is kids, the childish part is about right.

Im not the biggest fan of stop motion animation, but it works here.  (Although I do have to wonder why we got a flashback to Rudolphs story as hand drawn animation.  Why not just reuse the stuff from the Rudolph special?)  It feels a bit dated and low budget, but I did enjoy it.

Speaking of dated, they make a point of welcoming in year 19Happy at the end.  I had to laugh as we are currently waiting for 2015 to come in.  Yes, the special is 40 years old, but that definitely dates it.

While little kids might enjoy Rudolph's Shiny New Year, older kids and adults definitely will find it dated and slow.  Thats too bad because some elements work, but they are just stretched too thin.",1434844800,,2841,4.2504672897196265

486894,5,6302503760,"I spent entirely too much time looking for a digital version of the original Rudolph to watch this Christmas with my two year old.  I finally broke down and bought a DVD and lugged out a DVD player for that one.  However, having this version as a digital copy meant our son could watch it any time on his kindle fire, the TV or mommy's tablet (which ever wasn't in use).  He actually liked this better.  I think Eon was slightly less scary than the Bumble, and he really liked the baby.  There is a limit to how much a two year old can learn, but he definitely ""got"" it isn't nice to laugh at people.  ""Mommy, it not nice to laugh at baby.  They making baby sad.""",1357171200,2,663,4.1328125

It is separate from the Rudolph movie.  It is not a sequal.  It is great for the New Year.
I would reccommend this movie for kids from 1-120 years old for a good family movie.

486899,5,6302503760,"Boy, let me tell you, if you are trippin on some good acid, this movie will make perfect sense.  I was a little confused until Ben Franklin made his amazing cameo and tied the whole movie together.  With not-so-subtle references to child slavery and sexual abuse appearing all to often, it keeps the watcher guessing.  In closing, the only thing I enjoy more than watching this movie, is watching this movie on shrooms.

486900,4,6302503760,"I'm so happy ABCFAMILY Channel is showing all of the Rankin/Bass gems every December for a new generation to discover.  After years of seeing the original Rudolph Christmas Special, and only the original, it was great to see other shows by Rankin/Bass, including this one I missed.  I was a bit cautious at first ,after having seen the title, thinking it would be a very un-Christmas like show. But in the tradition of A YEAR WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS, SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN, THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY, and JACK FROST, this special retains a place among the christmas classics. Red Skelton is a great narrator in the same league as Burl Ives , Mickey Rooney,  and Fred Astaire.  The scene with the Three Bears is great. The story will keep both children and adults interested as Rudolph tries to save time by finding the BABY NEW YEAR.  It was great for me to find this gem and I hope you will too!",1102377600,4,897,4.478527607361963
486901,4,6302503760,"I saw this on TV. It is kind of lame but I still like it. Most holidays have specials, whether it be a movie or a TV special, but the only other New Year Special I know of is ""Happy New Year, Charlie Brown"".Therefore, this is unusual. It is supposed to be a Christmas special but I consider The New Year and Christmas seperate holidays. It has more to do with the New Year than Christmas. The only Christmas parts are Rudolph, his song, and Santa Claus at the beginning and end. Ironically, there is a 4th of July song,when they go to the Island of 1776.

486903,2,6302503760,"I finally watched this video again for the first time after, oh, 15 or 20 years.  I do recall not liking it as much as RTRR, but I didn't know why.  Now, I've got some idea.  The animation is fine, the songs are decent to good, the voicework is excellent.  But something was majorly wrong - instead of a good story, we get a plot outline.  The plot is a good enough one (Rudolph out of find Happy the New Year, a fellow misfit) but it's never developed at all.  Rudolph is set up to cross the Sands of Time, which is made out to be a dangerous task, but after meeting the evil bird, Rudolph and his friends cross it ""in no time at all.""  Characters come and go with no apparent reason (I'm thinking Father's Time ""stalwart"" general, but there are plenty) and with no...I was going to say development, but we hardly get introduced to the characters before they're gone.  Then Rudolph goes to search the Archepelego of Lost Years, which contains 1023, the year all the fairy tales happened (geez, I'll bet you 1024's pretty ticked).  My cynical brain wondered if Prince Charming had to put that slipper on Cinderella every day for the rest of eternity.  This story seemed like far too many ideas thrown together, with not enough story.  The first Rudolph special was busy (Herbie the dentist elf, Island of Misfit Toys, Yukon Cornelius) but it sort of congealed into a story.  This one just didn't.  Young folk may like it (although in this computer age, they may not) but I found it really rough going.",976924800,5,1501,4.454212454212454
486904,5,6302503760,"Romeo Muller and the folks at Rankin/Bass have done it again! This story is about how Happy the new Baby New Year runs away because everyone picks on him because of his big ears. So, it's up to everyones favorite reindeer  with the Red Nose to find him in time before the Ball Drops, or the old  year will go on forever. You will LOVE this heart warming tale, which is  vintage Romeo Muller. I grew up on it as a kid and I still love it to this  very day and you will too. Buy it at all costs!",958521600,15,493,3.9

i love this wonderful stop motion animation, the story line is great, funny and i love all the songs! i love the voice cast, and i love how they made father time look just like red skelton,  i guess im outdated too, but this was a hit special when it first aired as did all the other rakin/bass specials, if it was not so popular they would no longer air it on television, and how many decades has this been on tv? as long as all the other ones have been,

and i cant believe this one is getting a kick in the pants so many bad reviews about it, just because the story line does not follow christmas or have that special touch of the original rudolph movie, its a new years movie for goodness sake anyway!

im ashamed of those bad reviews, this is a classic in my book i watch it every year, its a tradition in my family, if you have never seen this before watch it give it a chance its worth it a fun show to watch promise you will love it,

these are the kind of shows that will never be seen again in this 21st century, where there is no adult language or adult humor, will not offend anyone, and its the kind of show that can be watched by the young and young at heart like myself.",1513036800,,1495,4.071428571428571
