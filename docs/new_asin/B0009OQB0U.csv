8064317,5,B0009OQB0U,It was in great condition. It shipped quickly. One of my favorite lower body exercise DVD. The moves are great for beginners and I have already muscular arms so I hate exercise DVD's that say full body workout then 98% of the moves are for upper body. This is what it says LOWER body boot camp!,1386720000,,294,4.267857142857143
8064318,5,B0009OQB0U,"I bought Billy Blanks BootCamp last week and finally used it today, and I can say that I have never sweated so much in my life. My legs were working hard, and I felt the burn!! There are squats, lunges, kicks, ab work, and so many other things. Plus there are bands that are used in this DVD that really add tension to the workout. I could barely keep up and I have been on a tight exercise routine for the past 4 years. This is an excellent addition to any fitness collection. This is one of my favorites!

I would highly recommend, 5 stars!!",1368144000,,543,4.171428571428572
