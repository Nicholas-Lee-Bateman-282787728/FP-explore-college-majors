8265845,5,B0017H413M,"Though I imagine watching this is not as good as doing a good course on the subject it is many many times better than trying to learn it from a book in my experience, the human body is too complex to put into words, you need a visual demonstration. it is very clear, and not boringly presented. I watched over and over often while doing other things. Not long after watching it it came in very useful, my elderly mother feel and broke her arm, we didn't know it was broken only that it was badly hurt, she kept saying ""it seems like I should be moving it"" thanks to this DVD I was able to tell her ""don't!!""- turned out to be exactly the right advice.",1516579200,,651,4.133858267716535
