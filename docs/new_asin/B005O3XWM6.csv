8480917,5,B005O3XWM6,"This production of Mozart's ""Die Zauberflte"" was filmed at the L'Opra national de Paris, Palais Garnier, 2001 and the viewer is at once enfolded in the three-fold magic of the music, text, and staging.  The costumes and sets are fairy-tale beautiful.  Tamino is dressed as a Persian prince, topped with a crown and turban.  Papageno is winsomely befeathered (as is his bride-to-be who makes a later appearance).  The Queen of the Night is literally star-crowned.

With the exception of Matti Salminen as Sarastro, all of the singers were young and relatively unknown in 2001, but they were perfectly cast and made beautiful music together.  I thought German soprano, Dorothea Rschmann (who later sang Pamina in the 2003 Royal Opera House 'Flute') was the standout voice--so clear, sweet, and young.  Her desolate ""Ach, ich fhl's"" in Act II, scene 4 brought tears to my eyes.

Polish lyric tenor, Piotr Beczala (whose career really took off after this 'Flute') sings a fresh, luminous Tamino.  Yes, he is a prince, but an innocent, earnest prince.

Detlef Roth's Papageno scampered cheerfully about the stage, never overdoing the comedy or the panpipes (as in some productions I could mention).  He was so young and cute I wanted to run up on stage and give him a big hug during his suicide scene, when he sings ""Schne Mdchen, denkt an mich...""

Desire Rancatore's Queen of the Night garnered the most applause from the Parisian audience for her immaculately sung fireworks.  A Queen can make or break a performance during Mozart's fiendish vocal gymnastics, and needless to say, Rancatore's Queen was a highlight of this production.

Even the minor roles were filled with pleasing voices.  The Queen's three attendants didn't overdo their admiration of the fainting prince and sang prettily.  The three spirits, performed by soloists from the Tlzer Knabenchor sounded wonderfully otherworldly.  Papagena's spirited soprano was easy to listen to and she provided a deft comic turn as the old woman.

The sets were an absolute knock-out, especially the clockwork set for the trials by fire and water.  I've never seen better (okay, with the exception of Ingmar Bergman's 'Flute' which was a movie, not a stage production).

Renowned Mozart interpreter Sir Colin Davis once said that, ""Mozart is simply God.""  He compared this composer's Singspiel in two acts to Shakespeare's valedictory work, ""The Tempest,"" and relates that one of Mozart's characters actually quotes Prospero.  This occurs when Sarastro is speaking of the Queen of the Night:  ""This thing of darkness I / Acknowledge mine"" (5.1.275-76).  How very appropriate since Mozart's librettist Schikaneder was among other things a Shakespearean actor. Mozart himself was said to be working on sketches for an operatic version of ""The Tempest"" when he died.

I can enthusiastically recommend this DVD, which is one of the most beautiful 'Flutes' you will ever experience, and yes, it will remind you of  an otherworldly 'Tempest' with Pamina as Miranda and Monostatos as Caliban.

NOTE:  The cover on my DVD version of this 'Flute' shows Tamino and the Queen of the Night and was released by Arthaus Musik in 2011.",1464825600,,3171,5.104854368932039
