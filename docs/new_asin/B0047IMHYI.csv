8418235,3,B0047IMHYI,"Good basic information, but there is little to no detail given on how to make the cakes look neat and professional.  A few basic tips could have made this much more helpful.  If you replicate these instructions you will end up with a cute but certainly not professional looking cake.",1332633600,,283,4.64
8418236,2,B0047IMHYI,"I got this DVD from the library hoping to learn something new but was very disappointed in the content. Very basic material and the end cakes looked very amateurish. The back cover describes the cakes as ""stunning fondant cakes"" but it lacks the stunning part.

If you are a novice and are just starting, this will be a good DVD to learn very basic techniques. But for the price, if you already have some knowledge in fondant, stick with another DVD tutorial.",1323907200,,459,4.597560975609756
8418237,5,B0047IMHYI,"Worth every cent.  Great info, learned new tricks and a wonderful baker!  I hope Robin Hassett does more instructional dvds!",1312761600,,124,5.15
8418238,1,B0047IMHYI,I was hoping for more information in the subject. Was very retard. This is the worst tape ever about this subject.,1299110400,,114,4.476190476190476
