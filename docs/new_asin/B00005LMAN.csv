1622740,5,B00005LMAN,"Even if you aren't a Jason Priestley fan, I urge you to watch this movie any way. It is an imaginative film worthy of viewing at least once by everyone.",1360454400,,152,4.1
1622741,5,B00005LMAN,"When we last saw Brandon Walsh he was leaving Southern Califonia to pursue a writing career with the Boston Globe. Obviously the Globe doesn't know talent when it see's it because now the cameras are following around Brandon and his buddies on their adventures. The crew from West Beverly is no longer around. We will miss you Steve, Dylan, and Mr. Walsh. But, now Brandon is actually cool. He is a gambling, heavy-drinking ladies man instead of the goody-two-shoes fruit he was in his younger years. He and his buddies are a versitile group. You have Brandon, his buddy Mike, a degenerate gambler who never won, Cory the Jersey Jinx, and Dangalo, the sissy of the group who falls for a trannie and tells him/her he loves it on the first date.

So, the guys are looking for some direction in life. They decide to put all their energy into getting money together to open a sports bar. This way, they can continue their drinking/gambling/womanizing but profit from it. See, they're geniuses. Sid won't spoil the ending or too much of the plot because it is highly recomended. So, take it from Sid, see Double Down. It's an Elf classic.",1197158400,6,1133,4.665
1622742,4,B00005LMAN,"well, Jason Priestley is in it so that's why I saw it, but it was a really good movie, it's got gambling and trouble that the boys get into, and some hot girls. but a good story and a cute bros before [girls] type of thing, i think people should see this.",1061510400,5,255,3.923076923076923

7944085,1,B00005LMAN,"I was expecting to see Neil Breen's masterpiece of cinema ""Double Down."" Instead, I got this? Jason Priestley, go back to 90210, you hack!

Neil Breen is one of the finest filmmakers of all time, but this was unwatchable. Where's Neil? I guess I'm stuck watching Fateful Findings, again. Oh well. Maybe someday I'll see Breen's cinematic debut and understand what true filmmaking is really about.

Long live Neil Breen!",1521072000,,419,4.9714285714285715
7944086,3,B00005LMAN,"It's a light-hearted comedy about a few friends who are addicted to sports betting. They end up betting their life savings on a ""sure thing."" Compared to the other low budget gambling movies I've recently seen on Amazon the acting in this movie is pretty decent. The chemistry between the guys is pretty good and believable. The movie has its funny moments.",1504915200,,357,4.774193548387097
