6889317,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"I suspected I'd enjoy the movie since watching the trailer the first time and really I've been intending to read Pynchon for quite a while, just haven't gotten around to it.

I didn't really know what to expect. I'd read a lot of reviews for it both positive and negative but I don't base my opinion much on reviews. When I do it is usually a very particular negative review, the kind that is completely emotion-based and lists any aspect of quality writing as a negative, that convinces me a book is worth buying. When I say emotion-based I mean that the reader--or in this case the movie-goer-- sat down at their local theater with a certain set of preconceived notions--and so, because they did not get what they wanted they didn't like it, even if what they got was better than their expectations. They might not even know it because they were so stuck on what they wanted.

So when I watched the movie I suddenly wondered if the haters had watched an entirely different movie. It's true that the story wasn't entirely transparent but it was not difficult to understand. It only required someone to stay awake which requires no effort as it was difficult not to laugh. Most of the people, including myself were laughing quite loudly and most of the people eighteen and fifty and looked to be ordinary.

It was not extremely violent but then what stoner movie about the seventies would be, unless the fulcrum of the story were police brutality or the cold war?

What's more it seems like the writer would've been an adult in the seventies. It's been said that truth is stranger than fiction and there are elements to the story that very much are that strange, things that only someone who was part of the seventies and its culture would think of. And of course Pynchon was in his late 30's during that era.

Lastly there were a few people who did not appreciate it on the first viewing but they liked it a lot better the second time. I would highly recommend watching it not once but twice and if you discover that it has grown on you a bit the second time you watch it, go and see it a third time. In fact I'm going to do just that especially because it was better than I thought it would be and hopefully I can convince a lot of my friends to see it too.",1421020800,6,2259,4.394736842105263
6889318,1,B00QXIIZ3W,"Inherent Vice is as bad as The Big Lebowski was good.

It seems as if the writers, directors and actors all had a lot of fun (with substances) while creating this film, but that sure doesn't translate to the viewer. The seemingly intricate plot evolves (well, not evolves, convolutes) at a snail's while mumbled unintelligible dialogue and dragging broken monologues beg your attention to wander to something, ANYTHING, that isn't the trainwreck of a film trying to take place. The plot is not intricate, it's just boring and poorly conveyed. The actors are top notch but the film still fails (or succeeds at a mission to become both maddeningly frustrating and entirely unremarkable simultaneously). I have never hated a film as much as this one.

Take a cheech and chong movie, but remove the humor.
Take ""The Usual Suspects"" and remove the resolution
Take ""Fear and Loathing"" and remove anything EXCEPT the period setting and the drugs

If you're still going to try to see this steaming piece of s***, get really REALLY high on something that makes you apathetic and easily amused by just about anything. But then again, if you're in a state of mind like that, save the money and go to a laundromat, park yourself in front of a dryer and watch a two hour episode of pants-vs-socks while someone else pumps in the quarters.",1421020800,8,1325,4.777292576419214

6889320,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"[NOTE: We all loved 'The Big Lebowski'. I'm not positive, but I think this is a different movie. It's got a different title, different actors, and they seem to be saying different things. Most of them aren't as funny. Even if you can get past a disappointment like that, you still might hate this movie.]

For a Thomas Pynchon fan like myself, 'Inherent Vice' was shocking. The rich intellectual payoffs, cleverly cryptic humor and subtle satire was amazingly accessible. I didn't have to wade through super-dense prose of the kind that dances around the accretion disk and balances precariously above the event horizon, stretching space-time thin as one approaches the singularity generating Gravity's Rainbow -- escape velocity is frighteningly close to the speed of light, and transitioning from the spatial coordinates of Pynchon's story relative to Earth normal is like travelling into the future, breaking free of Gravity's pull to find that 25 hours have passed between paragraphs... plotlines traverse narrative wormholes to seemingly random points in time and space. Compared to his 1974 National Book Award-winning classic, 'Inherent Vice' almost qualified as a... 'page-turner'. Like Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guys Don't Dance', Denis Johnson's 'Angels', 'Jesus Son' and 'Already Dead', and Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country For Old Men', Pynchon was testing his literary prowess against some tough hombres -- Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Jim Thompson, the unholy trinity of crime fiction and Noir-Lit; and in particular, L.A. Noir.

The adaptation of 'No Country for Old Men' was an anomaly, a rare celestial phenomenon. America's greatest living writer, Cormac McCarthy, provided a transcendent novel of Borderland-Noir that was seemingly made to be adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen, America's greatest living film-makers.

'Inherent Vice' is another rare example of perfect stellar and planetary alignment. Paul Thomas Anderson created a late millennial classic with 'Boogie Nights'; but his 2007 adaptation of the Upton Sinclair novel 'There Will be Blood', was a masterpiece... in the spirit of strange coincidences, 'There Will Be Blood' lost the Best Picture Oscar to 'No Country For Old Men', and Anderson lost out to the Coen's for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. His previous film, 'The Master' was another huge cinematic achievement, a very subtle satire and character study that examined a Scientology-like belief system, and the Hubbard-clone guru behind it all.

So now, with `Inherent Vice', America's second best writer-director-auteur has adapted a work of crime-fiction by America's second best novelist. Not that numbers like that ever mean or say anything beyond the person handing them out. This film has the feel of 'The Big Sleep' if Chandler had been a hippie, a joyously, purposely convoluted tale of strange literal and philosophical bedfellows. While I read 'Inherent Vice', I had a problem that comes up very rarely, in that I was unable to cast Doc Sportello from my database. In another strange symmetry, the same rare problem came up as I read McCarthy's sparse descriptions of Anton Chigurh. Neither Joaquin Phoenix nor Javier Bardem seemed like good casting choices when I learned of them; but by the time the credits rolled, both men had become those characters forever more. Phoenix is brilliant as Sportello, resisting the urge to channel the literally undead soul of Jeff 'Lebowski' Bridges. And Llewelyn Moss himself, Josh Brolin, is the hilariously ambitious `Renaissance Cop', Bigfoot Bjornsen.

`Inherent Vice' is comic Noir, played straight for the most part, but with an ingeniously serpentine, Chandleresque plot.
Doc's former love, Shasta, turns up after a long silence and ask him for a favor. She wants Doc to use his DA's office connection -- his part-time girlfriend, Penny -- to make sure her new man, a rich, Jewish real-estate developer called Mickey Wolfman -- who surrounds himself with Nazi bikers -- doesn't get ripped off by his wife and HER lover. Doc reluctantly but professionally agrees. Business gets busier when an OG Crip hires him to seek out a prison pal named Glen from the Aryan Brotherhood, to collect money owed him from their joint-business in Chino. It seems like another unlikely alliance, AND it just so happens that Glen is one of the Nazi bikers working for Shasta's beau, Mickey Wolfman.

First though, Doc visits the Wolfman estate, undercover, to meet the imposing Mrs. Wolfman, and her big, blond, Teutonic gigolo. Posing as a bank official trying to return money (when does that ever happen?), Mrs. Wolfman takes the bait, and hands over the `necessary documents' he requests. Doc now has a place to start on this scam investigation. Wandering through the Wolfman estate, the sexy Mexican maid shows him Mickey's tie collection, all embroidered with detailed nude likenesses of his many lovers. The maid points herself out... and helpfully points out Shasta too.

When his search for this biker named Glenn leads him to a brothel, Doc gets beaver-sapped. He wakes up somewhere else, surrounded by cops, lying next to a murdered corpse - as it turns out, it's Glen, the Nazi biker he was hired to find. It looks bad, but Bigfoot is playing it cute, and kicks him loose for suspicious reasons. Bigfoot has connections no detective should have with Wolfman, even donning an afro to star in the TV spots about the latest condo development project. Another client is waiting when he gets back, a toothless but attractive twenty-something former-junkie-turned-mom, played by Jena Malone. She sends him off to find a supposedly dead Junkie jazz-man played by Owen Wilson... Doc is warned by the friendly girl from the brothel (where he was knocked out and framed for the death of Mickey Wolfman's Nazi biker pal) that the jazz junkie is connected to a cryptic threat she calls `The Golden Fang'... An ominous sobriquet for someone who may be choreographing all these unlikely confluences.

That may have sounded like it contained many spoilers, but it did not; that craziness is just the beginning of Paul Thomas Anderson's latest masterpiece. The director and author recreate the disjointed atmosphere that may or may not have pervaded 1970 Los Angeles. Pynchon takes the free love philosophy and LSD paranoia to the absurdities of its logical conclusion. A Jewish landbaron makes himself a Nazi king-pin; Black Panthers plot with the Aryan Brotherhood. Cops cavort with gangsters, and beat up Hippies for a couple joints. A burnt-out hippie P.I. named Doc sleeps with an assistant D.A. named Penny. Everyone f**ks everyone, except the person they're married to.

This is film perfection, of a kind that drives some people from the theater in disgust. If you ask them about it, they never admit that it was the perfection that triggered their fight or flight reflex, but it was. You might have to spend a few minutes getting to the bottom of the complex psychological factors at work, but the truth is its own reward. In my own personal experience, some unenlightened movie-goers take it as a personal insult when you explain to them that they actually liked a film they insist they hated, and that they're only lying to hide their sexual attraction to butterflies. It's crazy to think that in 2015, people still take offence when you address them as lying butterfly molesters. Caterpillars, that's a different matter entirely. Running after people who flee cinematic perfection might seem like a strange pursuit, but when its all done, if my jaw hasn't been broken by a vicious beating, it makes me smile. Anyway...

This is also the best book-to-big screen adaptation I've seen since `No Country For Old Men'. Speaking of which, Josh Brolin is great as Bigfoot, capturing his sly intelligence and over-confidence. But Joaquin Phoenix once again proves he's on another level, acting the hell out of this beast. It's only January, but this will definitely be near the top of my 10 best films of 2015.

P.S.: It'll be interesting to see if anyone picks up the proverbial gauntlet Anderson's thrown down. While he definitely cherry-picked the Pynchon novel best suited for film, it wasn't easy to translate some of the novel's subtlest humor and satire, but he did it, and he did it well. Maybe Tyrone Slothrop, 'sexual V-2 rocket anticipator' -- and very bad one-night-stand -- will make it to the big screen. Or maybe not.",1420848000,20,8421,5.117090909090909
6889321,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"""Inherent Vice"" (2014 release; 142 min.) brings the story of Doc Sportello (played by Joaquin Phoenix). As the movie opens, we are reminded that this is ""Gordita Beach, California, 1970"", and a voiceover then introduces us to Doc, who lives in a small place at the beach, Doc is visited by a mysterious woman, who is seeking his help to locate her lover, who's gone missing. We later learn the mysterious woman is Shasta (played by Katherine Waterston), Doc's ex-girl friend no less, and that her lover is the (very married) real estate tycoon Mickey Wolfmann (played by Eric Roberts). We are at this point about 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would not only spoil your viewing experience, it would also require a bunch more paragraphs to explain it all... You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson, who most recently gave us ""The Master"", and before that films like ""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". In other words: every new release from this guy is truly an event to look forward to for movie lovers This time around, he brings us""Inherent Vice"", from the novel of the same name by Thomas Pynchon. If it wasn't clear yet from my brief introduction above, the movie shoots right out of the gate and if you're not paying close attention right away, chances are you will be hopelessly lost in no time. There are LOTS of characters to keep track off and even more plot points to go along with it. At times it is overwhelming, but be patient! The last 45 min. really bring the much-needed payoff. If you have seen the trailer in recent weeks (like I had), you might think there will be quite a bit of 'action' but in reality, in a movie lasting almost 2 1/2 hours, there is little of it. This movie is mostly about character development and correlating plot development, not about good guys/gad guys shoot-outs Second, there is a veritable all-star cast in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is once again masterful in his role of the private investigation (who may or may also be a real doctor?). Josh Brolin as the hard-nosed LAPD guy also gets a chance to show us his talents (MILES better than his previous movie ""Labor Day""), Reese Witherspoon also plays a cop (she's got maybe 5 min. worth of screen time). But the best performance of all comes from Katherine Waterston, an up-and-coming yet veteran British actress who simply blew me away. Look also for a blink-it-and-you'll-miss-it appearance from Maya Rudolph (the long-time partner of Paul Thomas Anderson). Third, kudos for the production set for this movie, which is immaculate. Check out the Burgie! beer cans, among many other set props from that era. Last but not least, the beautiful instrumental score is courtesy of Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead), his third time composing an Anderson movie. On top of that, the movie is chockfull with songs from that era (Neil Young, Can, etc.) AND an unreleased Radiohead song (""Spooks"").

""Inherent Vice"" finally opened nationally today and I couldn't wait to go see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. Moreover I saw a handful of people leave (and not return) halfway into the movie. They were probably expecting an action ""film noir"" of some sort. ""Inherent Vice"" couldn't be further from either action or 'film noir'. This is a Paul Thomas Anderson product! So set your expectations accordingly. ""Inherent Vice' is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1420761600,11,3521,4.7894736842105265
6889322,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice is a film better off experienced than understood. While the plot of it is pretty simple on paper, the ins and outs of Thomas Pynchon's novel weave circuitously around a gaggle of eccentric characters, a frequently lollygagging mystery, and you can practically smell the cloud of weed smoke wafting through every frame. This is exactly how Pynchon envisioned his exploration of the psychedelic hippie L.A. scene of the 1970s , and Anderson has done perfect justice to that vision. Inherent Vice is one long contact high, and though it may be fun at times the buzz eventually wears off.

I've been fascinated by the evolution Anderson's career has taken. He's long been my favorite filmmaker, but the Anderson I fell in love with; the guy who gave us Altman-esque ensembles like Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and Punch Drunk Love has slowly disappeared. His films are have always been small of scope but thematically sprawling, but with There will Be Blood and The Master he's taken on a more commanding approach, emphasizing mood and a powerful lead performance. Inherent Vice fits somewhere in the middle, but the tone is definitely loopier than anything Anderson has done before, which is a good thing.

Pynchon's novel is basically a jab at the soft underbelly of the hippie generation's waning moments; when those who had been ""against the man"" were now being co-opted willingly by ""the man"". It was a darker time than many realized; perhaps too high or stoned to notice how the world was changing around them. There's artificiality to most of the wild denizens of Inherent Vice, with the exception of drugged-out detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), who is like our goofy guide through one long acid trip. Whether you go in with your brain turned off or on auto-pilot, the plot is never going to coalesce into anything that makes a lick of sense. The lack of cohesion could prove as frustrating as a friend who messes up the ""puff puff pass"" rotation, but those who are in the right mood will find it a pretty groovy ride.

So where to start? Sportello, sporting a mean set of mutton chops, is a pretty laid back cat even after he gets hired by an ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston in an unforgettably alluring performance) to find her missing billionaire boyfriend (Eric Roberts). It isn't long before she goes missing, too, and soon Sportello is up to his eyeballs in weirdoes. There's a sell-out musician (Owen Wilson), an oddball dentist (Martin Short), mysterious organizations of ill-repute, and Sportello's flat-topped rule-breaking enemy Detective ""Bigfoot"" Bjornsen (Josh Brolin). Each encounter leads him from the beaches of L.A. to the seedy side of the counterculture generation, revealing a dark conspiracy connected to the upper echelons of society. The Man!!!

Inherent Vice is too incoherent and overlong to be completely satisfying, but it's Anderson's handling of the atmosphere that is just right. Like a mix of The Big Lebowski and The Big Sleep, its charm lies in being both ridiculous and convoluted. The constantly swerving plot and endless red herrings pile up to the point that you can't help but laugh. And right in the middle of it all is Phoenix's performance as the perpetually-dazed Sportello. He's not quite a cartoon character, but there are times when he comes off like an outcast from Airplane! or Top Secret! Phoenix never quite goes over the line, though, and Sportello remains a fascinating character throughout, one who is just level-headed enough to see how the world is changing for the worse. While the star-studded cast also includes Reese Witherspoon, Benicia Del Toro, Jena Malone, and Maya Rudolph, most of them are pretty forgettable. On the other hand, Waterston leaves a seductive imprint in her few appearances that lingers throughout, while Brolin is hilarious as the comically rigid Bjornsen. Coupled with Jonny Greenwood's diverse, era authentic score and Robert Elswit's crisp cinematography, the film ranks as one of Anderson's most beautiful and well-staged. Inherent Vice demands that you be in a certain kind of trippy mood to fully embrace it, and some will simply never be in the right head space for that.",1420675200,3,4216,5.044476327116213
6889323,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"I walked into Paul Thomas Anderson's latest movie thinking if it's half as good as the trailers have been, it will be GOOD! I've been up and down about his previous work (""Boogie Nights,"" ""Magnolia,"" and ""There Will be Blood,"") and I'm sure you have been too, so the jury was out. This is set in the 1970s, so part of the fun is recognizing the music, the cars, the language, the makeup and the clothes. Television at that time features Richard Nixon and ""Adam 12.""

This drug-riddled Byzantine plot requires that you pay attention, listen carefully to the dialogue, tune into the narration, AND suspend disbelief! When you leave the theater, you will discover that no one has the same impression of what they saw or what just happened. In my opinion it's because the central character is chronically stoned.

At one point I found myself clinging to anything that made a particle of sense, but I was out of luck with one exception: The dental business was booming in California during the 1970s because heavy cocaine use destroys teeth!

This is a small part of the huge cast of familiar faces:
  * Joaquin Phoenix (""Her"") is a private detective pulled into a bizarre case he would be smart to avoid. Listen to the voiceover in the trailer! Phoenix has a Golden Globes (Best Actor) nomination for this role.
  * Josh Brolin (""Labor Day"") plays a socially tone-deaf cop called ""Bigfoot,"" who seems to be in this up to his thick neck. He's bitter because after so many years of service in the LAPD he has been offered NO book deal, and NO television or movie rights!
  * Reese Witherspoon (""Wild"") is involved, but it's up to you to figure out how. I think this is the first time Witherspoon has been on screen with Phoenix since ""Walk the Line.""
  * Owen Wilson (""Grand Budapest Hotel"") Is this guy an undercover agent or just screwed up?
  * Jena Malone (""Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"") contacts the detective to find her missing (or maybe dead) saxophone-playing husband. She leads him to the dental office. Now she wants to be a drug counselor to talk teens into sensible drug use.
  * Benicio Del Toro (""Guardians of the Galaxy"") is a fast-talking attorney who sees the whole picture, but he specializes in marine law, not murder, consequently he knows ""inherent vice"" is a maritime term which refers to a cargo that is difficult to insure, like fresh eggs.
  * Katherine Waterston (""Boardwalk Empire"") is the ex who asks him for help. I think this relationship still has sparks.
  * Eric Roberts (""Suits"") is the (wannabe Nazi) missing millionaire. You'll never guess where he is!
  * Maya Rudolph (""Saturday Night Live"") is the receptionist who seems to know everyone and his history.
  * Michael Kenneth Williams (""Boardwalk Empire"") is the fellow who got out of the pen only to discover that his old gang has disappeared. He hires a private investigator to find out why.

Where does it end? That would be telling, wouldn't it? (If I knew.) Paul Thomas Anderson based his screenplay for this 148-minute R-rated (drugs, nudity, sexual situations and language) endurance test on the novel by Thomas Pynchon (""Gravity's Rainbow"").

This is a deeply Christian film that almost no Christian will recognize as such.  This is an incredibly tightly constructed, meticulous work that most people will find loose and disjointed.  Firmly rooted in the tradition of classic film noir, but set in 1972 California with Philip Marlowe replaced by a chain pot-smoking hippie detective played perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix, this film will befuddle you the first time you watch it, entertain you the second time, and amaze you with each successive viewing.

It's also hilarious, and probably contains the most humane and kind message of any film I have ever seen.  Yes, sex and drugs appear throughout the film.  But make no mistake, Phoenix's character ""Doc Sportello"" is a holy man on a quest.  He never takes money from anyone, and instead is searching for goodness and the truth.  Halfway through the film, if you are paying attention, you will realize that all the coincidences, details, and clues don't really matter.  There is a logic to them, and there is a real detective story here.  But as you journey with Doc, you begin to realize as he does that there is another story beneath and interwoven with the surface detective story that matters more.  And as Doc begins to pick up those strands and ultimately fulfills his quest, he reveals that the truth he has been searching for is his own redemption through acts of pure, unselfish kindness, performed at great risk to himself.",1501977600,2,1551,4.833333333333333

6889346,2,B00QXIIZ3W,"Inherent Vice pretty much takes the Big Lebowski and then cuts out Walter and every other character who played a part in keeping the narrative going.  As a result, this movie reflects what would have happened had the Dude been left to his own devices, plodding around in a stoner haze and really going nowhere.  Whenever you start to think that something is about to happen, it just fizzles out and drifts off to another setpiece where we meet some more characters who really add nothing to the story.

I'm a Paul Thomas Anderson fan, so I tried watching it a second time to see if it got better on second viewing.  It didn't, and I probably won't watch this again.  Everything this movie tries to do, The Big Lebowski already did it better.",1500422400,,741,4.5

6889350,1,B00QXIIZ3W,"This movie is highly disjoint and very staccato in the way it comes across.  It is supposed to depict 1970 and has some film noir style but doesn't depict any 1970 I remember.  There are some real gross scenes and language.  My mother in law walked out of the movie 20 minutes into it.  My father in law walked out to join her 20 minutes later.  My partner who picked the movie fell asleep with 30 minutes to go.  This is a longgg movie, almost 2.5 hours.  Most great film noir movies are 90 minutes top as it is tough to sustain ""Dark"" much longer.  Also factually, it promotes a type of Los Angeles that didn't exist in those days.  In this Los Angeles, there is heavy integration, with a black secretary, remember how big it was that Mannix the tv show had a black secretary in those days, and asians throughout.  But Asian integration wasn't wide spread in those days.

Also, I'm not sure PT Anderson is that gifted a film director.  Boogie Nights was a great movie, but Magnolia and Punch Drunk Love meandered and lost their way.  The Master was an awful and ugly movie.  There Will be Blood was overacted and had a ridiculously stupid ending.  Maybe he is more PT Barnum than anything else.",1495843200,,1196,4.397260273972603

It has a great cast and the 70's touches (costumes, hairdos, music, stoner culture) are great. It is superficially a detective movie, since the main character, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a PI, but it is not your typical detective movie.

I quickly discovered why I had never heard of it. While I felt ""Boogie Nights"" was very authentic, having lived in the San Fernando Valley in the 90's, I felt that ""Inherent Vice"" did not posses one authentic moment. Joaquin Phoenix with his lamb chop sideburns is perhaps the least compelling, unbelievable, and unlikable character in cinematic history. The rest of the characters, plot, and dialogue fall into the category of cartoonish, cliche, trying too hard to be hip, and ridiculous, ala Quentin Tarantino. I actually fell asleep during the movie.

6889357,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"Due to a completely misleading advertising campaign, this first attempt at filming a Thomas Pynchon novel seemed on first viewing a complete failure to me. I had not read the novel and was expecting some kind of stoner comedy.  That was my first mistake.

But please, if you are one of those Pynchon/Anderson fans who were initially disappointed, give it another try, and this time, turn on the subtitles.  The dialogue and voiceover really cannot be adequately followed with the flawed human ear.  That is a problem I know, but, damn it, if you turn the captioning on, you will discover a masterpiece.  Alternatively, read the book first.

As I see it, this story was Pynchon's elegy for the 60s.  Pynchon is generally not a real empathetic writer, but at the end, I was truly moved.  The idea that the hippie ethos was being co-opted and undermined almost from day one by sinister forces is exactly what brought us to the daily horror show where we are today.",1492992000,4,961,4.678571428571429

6889360,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"OK, ok - it's not exactly like the book and there are a few off color (blue?) scenes, and 'language' through out, but over all a very funny, entertaining and enlightening look back at the '70's and all, or what little, they stood for - definitely for the mature, not the uptight.  (Read the IMDb family rating review.)  By no means a 'family show', (it's rated R) but then little of what Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin does is.  This is a bad-cop/good-hippy-pothead-PI caper set in La La Land.  All the actors are good in their parts, particularly Phoenix, the dialog comes very much from the book, but some of the story line is altered, rearranged and truncated a bit.  (Especially the scene between ""Doc"" Sportello and Crocker Fenway at the country club.)  But the film does capture more than just the flavor of the novel.

I liked this film so much that I read the book and discovered Thomas Pynchon late in life.  He has become one of my favorite authors, since the passing of Mailer and Vidal.  The film and book reach far beyond the '70's and present an allegory for the absurdity of life - then and now.  Look at the circus of the absurd currently playing in Washington DC and all around the country, (man).  Life's a beach and a Palos Verdes housing development.  Who hasn't met, known or heard of a flake for sale like Shasta Fay and a rich ""developer"" like Micky Wolfmann,(don't forget the two 'n's or a few of the biker boys will be 'round to straighten you out), or a 'facilitator' like Crocker Fenway.  The LAPD takes a humorous hit, true, but in the 70's they were known as 'the blue meanies' in the hip sub-culture and on campus.  I had a cop friend then who would have grinned and laughed.  (They have changed their public image since then.)

6889366,1,B00QXIIZ3W,"This was one of several movies that I DVR'd a bit ago but didn't actually get around to watching until just lately.  Needless to say, this movie left me with 7 truckloads of questions and not many answers.

Okay I could follow the plot point regarding  private eye Larry ""Doc"" Sportello(Joaquin Phoenix) getting a visit from his beautiful/sexy ex-girlfriend Shasta visiting him for a bit and then mysteriously disappearing but outside of all of that, this movie is way too hard to follow.  Impossible to follow even more.  All this movie proved to be is painstakingly slow paced and not that well edited, boring as s***, it was not only incomprehensible/incoherent to the bone, but none of the characters motives made the slightest bit of sense, so many of the characters had seriously stupid names(Puck Beaverton, Shasta Fay Hepworth, Ensanada Slim, Petunia Leeway, Christian"" Bigfoot"" Bjornsen etc.), there were way too many scenes where not only didn't the dialogue make the least bit of sense, but hardly any of those scenes end up really going anywhere either.  The main character is a pot smoking detective who for no clear rhyme or reason is nicknamed ""Doc"".  You get no history on his past cases, nor is it clear how he can be high all the time and still keep in business solving cases.  It's also neither clear as to why it is that the main cop is nicknamed Bigfoot.  Also why is he such a hippie hater.  The whole thing with the dentist office, the sax playing undercover hippie, the businessman of whom decides to stay at some cult spa was all about, why Doc wakes up with his feet in the stirrups, or even who that girl is who's narrating what's going on even is much less how she knows Doc is anyone's guess.  I could go on forever about everything that doesn't make the least bit of sense in this terrible movie but I believe that I have covered enough on that.

That one scene of gratuitous police brutality was offensive and uneccessary.  The soundtrack is drivel also.  The characters are all flat as pancakes boasting no dimensions and completely unclear motives to boot.  Worst of all not only does this total train wreck have lousy editing/pacing, but it drags on for one completely unacceptable and unreasonable running time of 2 hours and 22 minutes.  WTF?!

All in all, do yourself a favor and completely skip this worthless and directionless piece of garbage.  This movie has nothing to recommend it at all.  There's very little nudity, the sex scenes aren't sexy at all, there's no action scenes, it's not funny, it's as charmless as a venomous rattlesnake, the characters are one-dimensional, there's barely a plot to it, the characters motives are all poorly explained, nothing interesting happens once, the editing/pace is entirely too slow and it never moves fast once, nothing that went on or was talked about in this movie made any sense at all, the acting was nothing to write home about, and after the near 2 1/2 hour running time you will very likely be screaming for all of your time back. 0 stars out of 10!",1485993600,,3043,4.696798493408663

It does deserve ranking among his better films however and certainly, aesthetically, is positioned as a signature film from this writer/director. Anderson's films are challenging - anyone looking for a movie you can take bathroom and snack breaks, let the movie continue, and return without difficulty are well advised to never watch Anderson's movies. The storytelling is the star here. Anderson dazzles with his customary array of shots revealing as much about mood and action as anything the performers deliver. He, likewise, takes one of Thomas Pynchon's more straight-ahead literary plots and gives them a strong cinematic adaptation that manages to approximate his complexity while still successfully uniting, in the end, all of the movie's disparate strains. Characterizations are not the film's strong suit. Anderson's eye for delving into people is beyond question - movies like Magnolia and Boogie Nights, among others, reflect this. Inherent Vice's opportunities for deeper characterizations, however, are co-opted by Anderson's storytelling brio and the POV's propensity for satire and commentary. However, regardless of its flaws, the film's daring mitigates them.",1464480000,,1235,5.717391304347826

Martin Short has a fun role that is against type. Katherine Waterston is stunning in what little screentime she has but I guarantee it will be unforgettable. There`s a good amount of hilarious Big Lebowski type humor as well. If you like Big Lebowski there shouldn`t be any reason to dislike Inherent Vice.

It is atmospheric and emotional, more about disconnected, poignant moments than a detective story. Even the characters are deeply confused about what is happening in the world around them, which I think is part of the charm. I'm sure this movie isn't for everyone--in trailers it came across as an action movie/comedy, and though it has some of those elements, that's not really the whole picture. I think a lot of the negative reviews here reflect people's expectations for the movie rather than what it actually is.

I read the novel Inherent Vice before I listened to the soundtrack and noticed two Neil Young songs in the movie itself, including the lines:

Will I see her give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?

The movie did not have a song with the lines:

I don't believe it:
I think I'll Take it or leave it.

Just thinking about how much I like a song Sea of Madness that CSNY did with Neil singing:

I want to bring you to this sea of madness.
I love you so much, it's going to bring me sadness.

It has been a long time since I watched Three Amigos, so when I saw Martin Short in Inherent Vice, I didn't remember how much I did not notice him when he was competing with two comic stars, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase. Inherent Vice is more like a movie in which cops need therapy because any cult could be another Charles Manson.

6889450,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"Joaquin Phoenix is definitely coming into his own feral field of acting grotesque comedy(with The Master before this), with his mutton-chops sideboards and gruffalo hair(looking like a Neil Young of the mid 70s), playing out his own version of heart-broken love, pining for his ex-old lady, Shasta Fay Hepworth(Waterson). With the downfall of the hippy dream of the 60s, everyones world has fallen apart, though they still smoke dope, the paranoids last hope is to connect everything with everything. They are thrown back on dreams, psychic flashes, Ouija boards, horoscopes, seeking patterns in the chaos of reality. Of course to help us on our way we have the doper, Doc Sportello, P.I., or his yang, friend-enemy, Big Foot Bjornsen (Brolin). Phoenixs performance is a wonder to behold, with his umms  and aahs and his connecting notes to ward off his short term memory loss. Hes a kind of hero of the marginalized by the forces of greed and fear. Carefree beaches of the 60s have given way to the pavemented real-estate of the 70s with the commercialization of the hippy dream. Under the paving stones, the beach is a tag at the start of the film taken from graffiti of Paris '68.

Paul Thomas Anderson has taken time off from his more serious film subjects to hang out with his favourite author, Thomas Pynchon, with one of his own more relaxed,successful novels(Inherent Vice),written as if out of pure pleasure. This is a breather between biggies for both artists. Paranoia is running the day,coming from Charlie Manson , the FBI,the LAPD or the mysterious Golden Fang. We have forebears in Hawks Big Sleep and Altmans The Long Goodbye. The ex, Shasta, starts the plot rolling, when she turns up,to ask,  I need your help Doc. For Shasta,Doc was the only doper who didn't use heroin and provided low rent living space.

Of course making films of novels is always fraught with danger; making films of wordy books is liable to lead the filmmaker astray, especially if he quotes from the book or has a voiceover. Its really all about translating the words into images. This film has no plot, we are pin-balled between characters and moods. Its like pedalling in low gear without much forward momentum with a lot of interior dialogue scenes ,together with close-up shots,everything seems flattened-out and equi-similar. There are a lot of pratfalls and jokes, each scene doesnt build up onto the next scene,we just randomly go from one tother. Inventing a pattern where there is none is something that stories andconspiracy theories have in common. There is no depth , characters are cartoons. Its hard for us to distinguish between the different sets of semi- crooks, and between friends and foes. Our P.I. has to discriminate between spells of laughing gas, LSD,cocaine and cannabis, what connects all the many threads. Doc turns up to salvage his generation and guide it back, with his kindness, to more merciful shores.

Many people approach Doc , from Shasta(Katherine Waterson terrific), whos worried about her missing lover, a property magnate, whose wife and her lover are sending to the asylum; to Hope Harlingen(brilliant Jena Malone) the ex-junkie mother turned drug counsillor to investigate her husbands death, saxplayer Coy(Wilson), who Doc finds alive working undercover for the FBI(Coy informs Doc of the 'Golden Fang', a Chinese syndicate running drugs, a schooner, or a congress of dentists or all 3); to the Black Power militant who has been ripped off by one of Wolfmanns bodyguards,who is protected by the Aryan Brotherhood, a gang of bikers. Doc learns Mickey (Wolfmann)was making philanthropic plans to atone for his sins by giving all his money away. This is the real problem, and the good guys and the bad guys get together to stave off this reprehensible act. The syndicates that flood LA with heroin, reel in the anti-capitalists via rehab, into conformism and conservatism.

There are two magnificent set pieces in the film,the Golden Fang headquarters,where Martin Short is a mad hatter dentist, whos screwing his receptionist and his clients, wrapped up in a drug ring, where Doc runs into Japonica a rich runaway hed once been hired to find; then an exclusive rehab institute, a hospital so white where hes shown around by an unctuous doctor,where a group of patients are dressed as Tibetan monks, and the inmates watch terrible old movies all the time, in a process of brainwashing these once rich kids. One of Docs missions is to reunite Hope and Coy. There are some real pleasures in a scene where Docs reminiscence of plashing barefoot along a sidewalk in downtown LA with Shasta to the tune of Neil YoungJourney through the Past, next to a vacant lot that ,when we next see it, is occupied by an ominous-looking corporate HQ. There are some great performances here from Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Katherine Waterston, Jena Malone, Owen Wilson. The soundtrack by Jonny Greenwood is Debussy-like and theres good use of surfer tracks as well as Neil Young. This film I guarantee you will grow on you like a jazz riff or to emulate the antique,slangy prose of Pynchon, like Docs mutton chop sideburns.",1450656000,2,5138,4.961672473867596

Paul Thomas Anderson is in love with words, but while the man may have
an ear, he has no timing at all. Much like The Master, a better film is
in here somewhere, but this isn't quite it. Paul Thomas Anderson's stab
at a Cohen Brother and David Lynch movie doesn't pay off, the laughs
don't come and only Josh Brolin looks like he's having any fun.

As much as the twisted, and ultimately disposable ""plot,"" zigs and zags
I wished I had taken a nap half way through. By the end, I wouldn't
have missed a thing. In fact, once you've passed the brothel and we
wake up in the desert, there's not much left to see. Except maybe
Martin Short.

Juaquin Phoenix inhabits what seems to be of Hunter Thompson's lost
Doppelg&auml;ngers in the form of PI ""Doc,"" in search of all sorts of stuff.
There's Owen Wilson eating pizza and Brolin eating weed and boy does
this movie want to be funny, but most of the time it isn't.

The camera lingers far too long just like most of those terrible Family
Guy jokes. Phoenix is quite good most of the time - as is just about
everybody - but despite the Inherent Zaniness, the movie just can't
connect. Nothing really digs in to you. As far as seedy LA, subversive

Incredible supporting cast and excellent musical score. My only warning would be, you have to be alert and watch the movie all the way through. If you zone out or don't focus, you will be lost, big time. Many people have compared this movie to a Coen Brothers venture and I think there are striking resemblances.

If you did live through it, this movie may feel like a brown acid flashback that will not end. At two and a half very slow, murky, meandering and digressive hours, it feels by the end like you've lived through the entire decade. It's beautifully, evocatively shot, and Phoenix leads a great cast. At first the whole idea of a hippie private eye is quite funny. But as the story fragments piled up, the situations got hazier and more muddled, the conversations mumblier and more incomprehensible, my mind got exhausted and wandered away. I stopped caring enough to keep track of all the characters and fragmented subplots, despaired that they would ever come together into anything like a coherent narrative, and spent the last hour or so feeling like I was trapped in a bad trip that would never end. Been there, done that decades ago, and have never wanted to go back. If that was the effect Anderson and Pynchon before him were going for, they certainly succeeded.

6889503,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"This is a peculiar movie, and certainly not for everyone, but it is lots of fun.

It is very slow moving, but that's intentional, and also quite confusing (at first), but that's also intentional--and fits perfectly with the main character's state of mind.

Doc, the main character, is a perpetually stoned private eye in a small California beach town (suburb of LA) in 1970.  He blunders through his life, and he blunders through his cases.  He is likable, spacy, low-key, constantly curious, and frequently amused and bemused by all the strange things going on around him.

He is asked by his ex-girlfriend, Shasta, to track down her newest lover, a real-estate baron, who was supposed to be guarded by a bunch of Hell's Angels but has gone missing.  Doc agrees, but as he blunders along, he keeps finding other mysteries, and is forced to juggle them all, getting more confused by the moment.  He is also harassed (and sometimes helped) by the FBI and an LAPD cop called Bigfoot.

Finally, of course, all the mysteries converge, and he figures them all out.

But the movie is not really about the mysteries, it's about the time and the scene.  It is both a satire and a loving homage to drugs and sex and rock and roll, as well to large boatlike cars, terrible hairdos and and furniture and fashions, astrology and fortune-telling, and all the breezy insanity and fun of the late 60s and early 70s.

If you don't like hippies or psychedelia or drugs or sex or rock and roll or nudity or non-linear plots or the glaring and lovely/horrible clothes of that period, you won't like the film.  If you do like any one of these, to say nothing of fun, you will.

Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant and understated as Doc, and Josh Brolin is wonderfully tormented and changeable (bully one minute, henpecked the next) as Bigfoot.  The supporting characters are super as well.

One of the big themes is the struggle of the Straights (law enforcement, government, corporatism) against the hippies (freedom-loving, non-chalant, live-for-today, silly, fun)--with the latter clearly far more likable and surprising.

Great movie.",1437868800,,2112,4.85754189944134
6889504,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"Southern California, early 70s. Director Paul Thomas Anderson enters Coen Brothers territory in a zany adaptation of Thomas Pynchons unfilmable novel. Joaquin Phoenix is Doc Sportello, a stoner/private eye who is paid a visit by a dusky former flame, Shasta Fay Hepworth (a beguiling Katherine Waterston), with a request to track down her current sugar daddy, an eccentric billionaire (Eric Roberts) who may or may not have given his fortune to a cult. Things unravel rapidly and Doc is soon investigating the sudden disappearance of Shasta herself and being drawn ever deeper into a world of drug smuggling, cults, uptight police and the FBI. Along for the ride is Benicio Del Toro as a maritime lawyer, Owen Wilson in one of the few straight roles as a musician trapped an indentured servitude, and Reese Witherspoon as a hotshot Deputy D.A. who makes the occasional booty call to Doc. This is the funniest movie of the year. Great to see Anderson return to a lighter moodthough not as epic or charming as Boogie Nights, Inherent Vice thankfully sheds the somber, heavy-handed tones of The Master, Magnolia and There Will Be Blood in exchange for surreal humor. Its filled with memorable off-the-cuff moments. In one scene where Doc is being interviewed by the FBI, agents suddenly seem to start picking their noses. Martin Short plays it straight and delivers his funniest performance in years as Dr. Blatnoyd, a sex and drug-addled dentist/frontman for the mysterious operation known as the Golden Fang. Even Josh Brolin is hilarious as Bigfoot Bjornsen, a full time cop and part time actor who makes Docs life miserable. The character names here are wackier than any in Hunger Games. The plot is as hazy as the drug-filled atmosphere, and its hard to categorize Inherent Vice as a thriller, murder mystery, or outright comedy; its a gumbo that simmers nicely, slathered in sunny nostalgic Polaroid tones courtesy of Andersons frequent collaborator, cinematographer Robert Elswitand. Theres a tinge of Chinatown here, a nod to The Big Lebowski there. It pops wildly with an occasional Looney Toons burst of action or character reaction. There may be no emotional investment in any character, but it grabs your attention and is boosted by a terrifically eclectic soundtrack and score (again by Radioheads Jonny Greenwood).

SURPRISES: Andersons wife, SNL alum Maya Rudolph, makes a funny cameo

The method to his madness seems to be following the drug high to wherever it takes him. Josh Brolin plays a police lieutenant, who seems that have known Doc for years, and uses him to solve cases. The movie is part the weirdness of Harper (Paul Newman, 1966), the nonsensical case of The Big Lebowski, and free form and twists of Robert Altmans The Long Goodbye. Anderson did study under Altman, and has based some movies on Altmans style.. (ack) Magnolia is a Short Cuts rip-off (cough).

6889539,1,B00QXIIZ3W,"The title should have been: ""Inherently Stupid, Movie"".  B-O-R-I-N-G!!!
  Maybe down deep there was a mystery script but they did everything possible to cover it up.  The main point was: ""Drugs, drugs, drugs,  ... Drugs are good and unless you're on them then life is confusing.  [There was even a flash back, where, in a penniless state, their thinking was hindered by reality; because they couldn't score drugs.]
  The film makers, seemed to, feel that drowning the script in drugs would make the director and writer ""Cool"".  It didn't.  Then top it off with government conspiracy, twisted lasciviousness [implied, not shown], and some bizarre characters, as the whip cream, sprinkles, and cherry.  As the insurance commercial says: ""Sprinkles are for winners.""  Not this loser movie.
  On the other hand The camera work was excellent.  Probably the actors were fine but the convoluted script pulled them down like 400 pound lead boots on a swimmer in 7,000 feet of ocean depth.
  The main plot was that a bunch of paths cross a heroin shipment from ""The Golden Fang"".  And a drug addled P.I. is searching for connections to get the answer.  At least two hours too long.",1435968000,4,1172,4.887755102040816

However, I did fall asleep halfway through. I was also insufficiently interested in what I had already seen to bother watching the rest of my 24-hour rental the next day. Perhaps sobriety would have helped my enjoyment; I'll need to give it another shot.

I also really wish Anderson would have told his actors to speak up. It's easy to lose the plot and/or one's interest in the film when the entire cast mumbles their lines like fourth-graders in a school play.",1435968000,2,625,4.73394495412844
6889542,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"Inherent Vice is defined as self-destructive nature, which makes an unacceptable risk. Its a very appropriate title in several ways. The film is polarizing, as is most film noir and neo-noir, most people either like it or they don't. Reasons to watch are as follows: (1) The plot, like most film noir, is convoluted and difficult to follow, but if done well then it is unforgettable. Inherent Vice achieves that layered storytelling aspect (or lasagna effect) until the very end with an inconclusive conclusion. That is unfortunate, because the failed ending, as with other Anderson films, hurts Mr. Anderson's legacy as a filmmaker. (2) On the other hand, American director and Southern California native son Paul Tomas Anderson re-creates the hazy world of 1970 very realistically. Just watch mentor Robert Altman's 1973 film, The Long Goodbye (set in 1973), and observe the similarities. The film successfully and stylistically captures the 1970 zeitgeist (or spirit of an era) very well, such as documenting the Charles Manson fright and subsequent hippie paranoia that gripped Los Angeles (traffic stop scene).  (3) Lead actor Joaquin Phoenix inhabits his role as stoner P.I., Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, and is thoroughly believable throughout the film. Larry is representative of the film's other characters and ultimately Mr. Anderson's vision. Characters in this film are kept at a distance and, we the viewers, care little for them or their problems. They are hazy and bizarre just like 1970 L.A., but so is the subsequent culture; that is what makes them special, interesting, and worth filming (Anderson's point). It's not slice of life Anderson's going for, but zeitgeist: the spirit of an era. And if that zeitgeist contains inherent vice then all the better for capturing a fleeting historical interregnum on film.

6889573,2,B00QXIIZ3W,"Ive pretty much had it with Paul Thomas Anderson.  HARD EIGHT was a tight, well-spun little con story.  BOOGIE NIGHTS was a sweeping, ridiculously entertaining look not only at the porn industry but at the American Dream.  MAGNOLIA was a brilliant, broad look at the anxieties of modern life (thats putting it VERY simply) that had some strange, almost inexplicable things happen, but still added up and made beautiful sense.  PUNCH DRUNK LOVE was a pleasant diversion, but sometimes meandering.  THERE WILL BE BLOOD started grandly, featured an epic performance but ended up a steaming pile of what the!?  THE MASTER was compelling and gripping, but again, ended up collapsing under the weight of its own efforts to be obscure.  And finally, INHERENT VICE takes a complex but coherent novel and turns it into a well-cast, well-acted 2.5 hour chore.  Anderson no longer seems interested in telling a story.  He seems to think having great actors giving committed performances absolves him from writing a narrative that can be followed, asking his actors to enunciate or to give an ending that has any real meaning.

Joaquin Phoenix stars as a stoner private eye in the 1970s, who begins to follow a case when his ex-girlfriend (whom he clearly still loves deeply) asks him to get involved.  This case ends up having more tangents, dark alleys and coincidences than wed normally be asked to grasp in half a dozen mystery stories.  And so many characters in the movie are hippies, stumbling around, doing drugs and generally making little sense when they talk.  I imagine the actors all reading the script through for the first team, with the luxury of re-reading, of having the words clear on a page, of having their director/screenwriter to call upon with questions.  But Anderson neglected to imagine a confused audience, mightily working to give a crap about what was going on.  While steeped in period detail and having a pretty great soundtrack, INHERENT VICE was just so dreadfully boring.

I got through the film, because, again, it is well cast and some interesting work is going on.  Phoenix is great, and hes the only reason the film gets two stars.  Josh Brolin is amusing, but his character arc falls apart.  Relative newcomer Katherine Waterston is charismatic at times, and vacuous at others.  Owen Wilson doesnt do much, and neither does Reese Witherspoon (who seems a bit embarrassed by the proceedings).  Martin Short gives a crazy, SNL-sketch performance that is completely out of synch with the rest of the film, but manages to inject some much needed life into it.

Anderson can be a great filmmaker.  BOOGIE NIGHTS and MAGNOLIA are two of my favorites.  But it now feels like hes stopped making films for anyone but himselffulfilling ideas and exploring themes that mostly resonate with him and are (seemingly) obscured to the audience.  I don't normally consider myself an ignorant film-goer who seeks to be spoon-fed his materialbut for two movies in a row now, Anderson has made me feel stupid.  Frustrate the hell out of me once, shame on you.  Frustrate the heck out of me (and barely keep me awake) twiceshame on ME.  Im sure Ill watch Anderson againalways hoping for a return to what made me like him in the first placebut I won't be happy about it!",1434240000,,3276,4.864620938628159

I recently saw the film based on the novel and that too bordered on the ridiculous.  I lived through the Sixties, remember them, felt we were on the edge of a lasting social change, and so feel that I have a built-in connection with those times.  With this novel, though, I worry that my connection with decades past is built on shifting sands.  It just couldn't have been as stupid and self-absorbed as Pynchon would have us believe.

Joaquin Phoenix is amazing here. He makes Doc Sportello a hilarious, cartoonish character that everyone will enjoy watching. Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius. He frequently crafts artistic, absorbing films. Every film of his is one that you will no doubt revisit and think about. This is one that you will never forget.

Answer:  the first time.  Or the zeroth time.  And some woman named Celrifre or Mnusire or something.

Then I realized, the problem isn't the movie; it's Thomas Pynchon.

I remembert that book being chock-full of zero-dimensional characters with stupid names, and a meandering plot where the various scenes, involving a woman's search for information connected to a dead lover's will - could have been in any order with no loss of coherence.  The back of a cereal box would have been more edifying - the characters make Cap'n Crunch look like Captain Ahab in comparison.  ""Inherent Vice"" is basically the same thing, only with a male protagonist, ""Doc,"" searching for information connected to a vanished real-estate mogul.  There's weird sex, Nazis, vicious cops, and...I turned it off when I realized it was the same damn story, only retold with different details.  At the end of ""The Crying of Lot 49,"" we know less than when we started, and I suspect ""Inherent Vice"" is no different.

6889712,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"Man - I really wanted to love this movie. What a great cast and I really, really, admire Paul Thomas Anderson so I'll admit up front that one of my three stars is for the top notch assembly of talent. I'll also preface this as I do with all my movie reviews that spoilers are for suckers so I won't give away any of the play-by-play details.

For the first 30 minutes I thought this was a first rate indie-style movie on par with The Big Lebowski or even The Grifters. It's smart, witty and has a great texture that is immediately identifiable as a really cool time in the post-60's pre-disco era of the 70's and it's set in that magic window of history when California was the Amerian Nirvana for freaks and liberals.

Joaquin Phoenix hits his on-screen stride from the opening fade-in and gracefully pulls you into what appears to be a period themed detective story. Immediately you get the pacing and dynamic of his character in his particular universe and are compelled to envy his freedom to support so many vices yet be such a brilliant mind.

However, as the story unfolds and the plots intermingle you see Phoenix unfairly battered about by the story and almost in parallel the more he ingests the more nonsensical the whole plot becomes. Perhaps the biggest flaw is that at no point does the viewer feel like what's happening to Phoenix is either deserved or karmic - as a matter of fact it almost feels vindictive, as if the writers are out to persecute their anti-hero, not the universe or even his (never explained) past.

So, how bad is this movie? My wife and I - who have heroically suffered through a s*** ton of B for Bad movies - turned it off. I won't tell you when in terms of the plot other than that when we did there was no plot left.

Hopefully the next Paul Anderson movie is something more like Boogie Nights or Magnolia but Inherent Vice is at worthy of watching when it comes to streaming for free.",1430697600,,1926,4.429378531073446

6889716,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"Perhaps INHERENT VICE could be the ultimate combination of PT Anderson's brilliant filmmaking career. A pulsing soundtrack like BOOGIE NIGHTS, an ensemble cast like MAGNOLIA, the strangeness of American romance as in PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, a lead role driven by some dependency as with THE MASTER, the dryness of HARD EIGHT, the verisimilitude of THERE WILL BE BLOOD; INHERENT VICE reflects an artist who has continued to perfect his craft with each production, visibly with passion.

The story here is deeper than realized. After my 3rd viewing, I'm confident the film will be seen as a masterpiece. It is certainly deserved. Watching the movie with subtitles offers a stronger connection with the story, keeping all the characters in check. It is confusing, but encourages the audience to question the concepts of hippie-love being invaded by darker capitalistic forces, worshipping greed over the music, bulldozing black communities for erotic massage parlors, tag-teaming with nazis and Asian drug cartels...

There's a lot of drama and dry wit provided here. Of course anything sourced from the mind of Pynchon is sure to be worth the screening. But don't expect it all to click during the first viewing.

The films storyline is hard to follow and its selling point is really the tone it inhabits  a foggy, stoned version of Los Angeles in the early 1970s with a lot of fun goofy humor throughout. The cast is superb all round, great performances from everyone especially lead Joaquin Phoenix, the movie is R-Rated so features a little violence, full graphic female nudity and plenty of drug use! The films humour and style is its driving point and is presented as a sort of pot-induced haze so it feels like a journey into someones state of mind. This movie will certainly not be for everyone, and will certainly take several repeat viewings to fully take in what your watching if you can handle the 148-min run time which can be slow in places, but none the less its very enjoyable and original.

In almost every single other way, however, the film is magic. But you have to have your radar up for a film like this. The slow accumulation of detail, the unfailing mood, the hilarious performances, the haunting and melancholy score that bubbles up unexpectedly, the unbelievable transitions, the hallucinatory feeling for the passing of time, the brilliantly naturalistic recreation of a lost era - it's unique and beautiful, full of portent, and one of the strangest and most individual American movies I've seen in a long, long time.",1430524800,,983,4.987804878048781

6889748,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"People who are not literate (90% of the American public), or who are not  fans of Pynchon will not ""get"" this movie.  They would be wise to read the novel from which it is adapted before seeing this film.  There's a lot more humor in the book than in the film, but some of it is salvaged by the way Phoenix and Brolin play off  of each other.  Martin Short is fantastically accurate as Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd.
The quality of any masterpiece is often derided by many of the masses, who, as far as I'm concerned should leave the letter ""m"" off the plural noun I use to designate them.  This is a true poet's reflection of the time, and Mr. Paul Thomas Anderson and Thomas Pynchon have joined together in a labor of love.  It is not Film Noir.
I had always considered Pynchon's work ""unfilmable.""  His use of colloquialism and the rhythm of his prose are everything.  This is not a totally successful movie because of that fact.

6889753,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"INHERENT VICE stars Joachim Phoenix as Doc Sportello, whose ex-girlfriend Shasta (Katherine Waterson) comes to him with a story about her super-rich real-estate tycoon lover, Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), and the plot his wife Sloane (Serena Scott Thomas) has set in motion to get away with his billions.

Director Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted an unusual mystery thriller in which surface appearances belie true motives. The world he has created is one of embedded corruption, kidnapping and murder. Doc is drawn into the intrigue by his femme fatale former lover, setting the groundwork for bad things to come. This is a typical film noir ingredient, and its tapped for full melodramatic effect here.

Phoenix has always been a quirky actor and he fits perfectly in Andersons strange, convoluted milieu. His Doc is seen nearly in every scene smoking a joint, and Phoenix manages to suggest Docs drug haze and paranoia as he immerses himself further into the labyrinthine plot.

There are colorful characters a-plenty, including cop Bigfoot Bjornson (Josh Brolin), an underhanded girlfriend in the D.A.s office (Reese Witherspoon), a double-crossing musician (Owen Wilson), and a seriously unbalanced dentist (Martin Short). Though these characters are fascinating in themselves, they tend to clutter the narrative, and its often difficult to keep track of whos who as the various tendril-like sub-plots develop.

But a funny thing happened after that first viewing.  The things I liked about the film (the lost dreaminess especially) just kept coming back into my mind.  It got to the point where I made myself watch it again, and now, I'm seeing a great film where 1 viewing is just not going to do it justice.  I mentioned the dreaminess of the film already, and the film also gives the viewer laces of dark humor, drama, a melancholy, and ambiguity most films lack anymore (I'm wondering how much of this film is really happening, and how much is in Doc's stoned mind).

6889838,2,B00QXIIZ3W,"Watching this movie, I came to the conclusion there must be a whole sub demographic out there whose main occupation, or pre-occupation is, watching movies. That way, all the vague allusions, set pieces, satire, insider references, conspiracy theories, fringe theories, spatial warps and dangerously paranoiac thinking could be understood. Mostly by white people, I believe. By white, I mean Anglo Americans, whose forefathers came to this country to escape persecution in order to make money. Maybe that's what's behind it all. But to say this topic and the method by which it is rendered possesses a universal appeal is, I believe, slightly misguided. Especially when the various set pieces which constitute the plot are held together with the thinnest thread of coherence. Having read, and I say this with hand on heart, I mean actually READ, other Pynchon books- I cracked Gravity's Rainbow, for which I should have been given at, the very least, a Boy Scout Badge of Merit, his style in the movie was instantly recognizable- patois lifted straight from literary genres which were already dessicated by the time he got there, plots which fly through the sky, defying gravity in the name of profundity, to service his personal notions of deep thematic work.

6889854,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"Perhaps a long strange trip, but one with enough curious encounters to linger fondly and amusingly in your memory.  An appropriate word, trip, for this THC generated adventure.  Not hallucinogenic, like LSD, mushrooms or peyote, where reality becomes subject to imaginative (or cosmic?) projections.  More a shift in the gaze, an unexpected angle, including Pynchon paranoia, which makes it not just the exotic travelling of one meaning of trip, but also an extenuated stumble, bumping into things, accidents no matter the purposefulness of Doc's intended steps.  And the encounters through this altered consciousness not only surprise but reverberate intensely as in blowing your mind.
I didn't know what to make of it while taking the trip with Doc.  The movie seemed to float along like his almost incoherent mumbles, barely understandable.  I missed, for instance, the source of the narrator, that high, childlike woman's voice and her omniscience.  She seemed at times to appear beside him, and yet I thought perhaps he imagined her.  I had a sense of the plot, having read the book (I'm a huge Pynchon fan) but, like many works I have read or seen years or even months before, details got lost in time, and what I remembered became a sort of inherent (so to speak) guide, almost unconscious.  I still think it may have helped me follow the complexity of the film better than someone encountering it for the first time.
Afterwards, what struck me most was the ambiguity, the ""inherent vice"" of the all the key characters, both major and minor.  Like Doc's lover, the deputy DA, as cold and calculating as any of the characters, being seen letting loose and getting high in his bed.  There's Wolfman losing his mind of course.  The snitch is pure ambiguity, and his wife, getting straight and becoming a loving and healthy mother, shows significant character change.  The hypocrisy of the main bad guy reveals the evil and ruthlessness of ambiguity.  And the intense love scene/confessional/almost rape (within the confession and with the suddenness of the coitus) expresses a deep ambiguity in the two lovers' relationship.
Speaking of relationships, both Doc and Bigfoot may have in some ways been the least ambiguous.  Bigfoot's a tough detective, his purely establishment flattop crew cut an amusing and historically appropriate contrast to Doc's long hair and ungroomed mutton chops.  And Doc's antiestablishment behavior couldn't be clearer in his lack of monetary interest (though an amusing regret can't help being revealed) as well as his relentless inhalation of marijuana.  And yet they somehow have this weird, completely inexplicable relationship with each other that reveals not only their ambiguity, but a dense richness of character.
I think the film works (not completely, but certainly well enough) because of the richness of character as well as milieu.  It is beautifully shot and beautifully acted.  I can understand people hating it though.  Like Doc himself, it has a languid pace, a confusing logic and an undisciplined structure.

6889883,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"This is a brilliant film. Paul Thomas Anderson has yet again created an American masterpiece. Everything about this film is superb: the direction, the perfectly adapted screenplay, the acting, the music (by Jonny Greenwood working with Anderson for the third time). Anderson has taken the insanity of Pynchon's novel and transposed it to the screen with such grace that it becomes totally his own. His imaginative camera use and his eye for humor is at its height in this. Now I would like to address some of the critics of this film, who cite it as a confusing mess: first of all I am guessing they have never read the book. Secondly, why does being confusing make it a bad film? If nothing else, the technical aspects are all incredible, even if you don't understand it. And is it confusing? Of course it is! But I cannot believe how many people do not understand that that is precisely the point. Watching this film, we are supposed to feel like the drug-addled dope fiends it portrays. We are supposed to feel paranoid and witness countless loose ends and at the end feel a little uneasy at just how much we cannot completely comprehend. This is a story of America, and its own inherent vice; it is a story of the evil and greed that hides below the surface. The kind we feel may be there but cannot completely know for sure. Is our paranoia justified, or not?",1427673600,2,1364,4.548780487804878

6889909,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"After a long wait I've finally seen Paul Thomas Anderson's latest cinematic creation, and...it was different, to say the least. It has some loose plotting and a narrative that takes a lot of detours, but the acting, cinematography and music, as well as a keen sense of style make this essential for PTA fans. Other people not so inclined to like indie or art films like this will probably find it slow and boring, though, but it's their loss. The story follows Larry ""Doc"" Sportello, a private eye who is put on a case brought to him by a former girlfriend, and that has to do with the disappearance of her current lover who is some real estate tycoon. But here, the story and plot aren't really the point. What ensues has more to do with capturing the feel of an era, that pivotal moment in US history when the hedonistic culture of the 60's gave way to the more restrained 70's. Doc represents someone who is caught between the two and is somewhat of an outsider, but the perfect lens through the audience can view what transpires onscreen. Thematically, there are a lot of elements at play. There's plenty of drugs and paranoia (some of which is brought on by drugs), but also references to the civil rights movement, the Manson family and other things one would think of when defining the 60's (particularly the late 60's). When it comes down to it, this is an odyssey that doesn't require complete understanding to appreciate. Just let the film wash over you like a wave and savor the experience. For now I need to just let it marinate a little longer in order to really develop a coherent opinion about it, but I did enjoy the film nonetheless. I don't completely get everything that happened, although further viewings might clear some of it up. From the technical side of things, INHERENT VICE delivers exactly what you'd expect from a PTA film: stunning visuals, immaculate production design, incredible performances and an eclectic score and soundtrack. Overall, this is loosest but also funniest film that PTA has ever done, and his fans should be pleased.",1427414400,4,2067,4.696969696969697

6889989,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"This is a long film set in year 1970 (California LA) with a hard to fallow/confusing plot, but it is the long individual scenes and interesting characters that make this film in my opinion worth 5 stars.  The soundtrack is pretty good, I think it could have been done better.  Joaquin Phoenix plays (Larry) a laid-back, drug addicted, hippie who does private investigations on the side (think Detective Colombo meets John Lennon from the 1970s').  Josh Brolin starts as (Bigfoot) a charismatic, short-tempered and wise-ass cop who together with Phoenix tries to  solve a mysterious disappearance of some prominent LA businessman/land owner played by Eric Roberts. It all starts off with Larry's ex-girlfriend Shasta, who asks Larry as a personal favor to investigate the above mentioned disappearance. The deeper Larry digs to find out the truth the more trouble he gets into.
The film also starts: Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, and Benicio del Toro.

Inherent Vice (2014) has a little bit of each from the following list of movies: ""Fear Loathing in Las Vegas"" (1998), ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997), ""American Hustle"" (2013), and ""Klute"" (1971).  Larry seems like a character Hunter S. Thompson would have created.",1426809600,,1214,5.2

Cool cars, cool clothes and lots and lots of drugs. There is some sex but nothing graphic. Making appearances is Porn actress Belladonna and ex UFC fighter Keith Jardine.

On the surface it may remind you of, ""The Big Lewbowski"", but, ""Inherent Vice"" is it's own thing.  And all of the story fits and resolves if you are paying attention.

P.T.A. believes his audience is intelligent.  Maybe he is an idealist in a cynical world, just like the protagonist in this film.

Not a masterpiece or even P.T.A.'s best film, but I really enjoyed it and found the characters and dialogue to be entertaining and often hilarious.

6890012,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"Oh, what a long hard trip this has been. This film may be compared to others that develop a cult following, and, well it should. This is a strange film, but if you lived during the 70's and experienced that generation, it seems quite normal. A little off beat, off kilter, but fine, just fine.

The film is filled with named actors, coming and going and filling the screen with strange names. The director, Anderson, developed the book from a Thomas Pynchon 2009 novel. Every character is a character within themselves. Private Detective, Larry 'Doc' Sportello, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a long haired fellow, smokes pot, maybe more, lives in the California beach. He works for anyone with a story, decent man, pulled here and there, and knows most everyone worth knowing. His ex girlfriend, Shasta, comes a calling one night wanting help. Her current boyfriend is in trouble, and she is involved in some shenanigans. Doc gets involved with real estate bigwig Mickey Wolfmann, played fleetingly by Eric Roberts. Michael Kenneth Williams, Owen Wilson, Jena Malone, Reese Witherspoon, Martin Short, and Josh Brolin, who plays an LAPD Detective known as Big Football pepper the film. The film intertwined with all, one person leads to the next and comes around again.

One of the best parts of the film beside the acting is the soundtrack. Glorious 70's music, that we all know and love. Neil Young is center and from there it is all good.

6890021,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, The Master, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood) put his stamp on the writing of Thomas Pynchon's vision and nostalgia for the hippie era, created a zany screenplay and directed this rather confusing mess of a film. True, it is an Anderson-junkie's dream, but the story is so beaten to death with voice-overs and conflicting lines and plot directions that what is left is a hint a Pynchon's writing genius and some very well drawn caricatures by talented actors. That makes it work - on some levels.

We're on the 1970s cusp of the hippie ear where hippies are now stoners and everybody is drug addled. ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) works at times as a private investigator. While high (which is most of the time) his former girlfriend Shasta (Katherine Waterston) visits to reveal she needs his help in a complex scam involving her lover Michael Wolfman (Eric Roberts) who Shasta believes has been kidnapped. From there the plot goes all over the place, all through the cannabis cloud that blurs the storyline to a great extent.

Joaquin Phoenix was made to play this role and the rest of the cast includes a very fine ""Bigfoot' by Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro, Owen Wilson, Michael Kenneth Williams, Maya Rudolph, Reese Witherspoon, Martin Short, etc. Beware of a lot of crude dialogue and innuendos and outright bad taste, but if all of the above is to your liking you'll probably make it through this VERY long movie.

6890023,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"Inherent Vice may not be for everyone, as it is long and sometimes confusing. However, I found it to be a very unique and enjoyable viewing experience. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent throughout, providing us with an entertaining and thought-provoking performance. Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin, and Owen Wilson also provide memorable performances. There are so many speaking actors in this film that it is hard to credit everyone, but I found all the characters to be lively and necessary to the plot. The story builds slowly, but has its rewards if you have the patience to wait for them. For me, this film moves at the perfect pace, not being too fast or too slow. Its a good film to sit back, have a drink and chill.

Besides the acting, an aspect that pulled me in was the unique styling of the film. The music, clothes, camerawork, etc. all transported me into another era. I still find it surprising that the director of this film also directed There Will Be Blood. Both films are incredible, but also different in more ways to count.

There are movies you get to adore as they represent a way of looking at things that is very close to your own, and as they take you to beloved journeys to the other side(break on through!).This is not a movie about drugs, not about hippies, not about yearning for the gone past, but about the shades of fantasy that are the essence of our reality. As with all kinds of great cinema, this is real life bigger than real life. This is mine mine mine! Thanks to all the participants who made such a great work(and Joaquin Phoenix, whom I must admit I didn't like much until now, becomes a cult image with the probably best performance of the year, among many great performances, one must stress).One of the movies I suppose I will keep watching over and over again the years to come(I' ve already went twice to the theater to enjoy it on the big screen while I still can).",1425945600,4,1440,4.542307692307692

6890042,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"The film has tremendous rewatch value! When I saw it in theaters, my brain was very busy trying to follow the story and keep up with the constant introduction of new characters. Having been through it once and having a general understanding of the plot, I was able to focus on the style, the cinematography, the curiosities, the colors, and the narration much more. The narrator is on a different level, providing fancified, wondrous prose atop the comically matter-of-fact dialogue and visuals. In this way, the narration functions a bit like that of Apocalypse Now: It's somewhat stereotypical of a certain genre of novel, but being blended with cinematic action that is quite removed from the narration makes for a rich piece of art. The narration and action finally interact only in the last second, the very last look on Joaquin Pheonix's face.

PT Anderson didn't make this for mass consumption, but it is still a masterpiece like his prior two films. And this is indeed my favorite Jonny Greenwood score so far. I wasn't sure how I felt about the picture after first seeing it, but now I think it will be one I revisit frequently over the years to come. Once the viewer's brain is no longer frantically trying to keep up with the pace of the mystery, the film is solidly entertaining, visually and aurally beautiful, and it ends with a nice metaphysical question.

A plot less confusing than purposely streamlined, this movie may be a tough sell for those who are accustomed to a movie that meets them halfway. If you surrender yourself to an experience more poetic than narrative, and let the film wash over you as such, expect a wonderful movie experience. While it may not be satisfying as a traditional whodunit, it does something completely new and its own with the genre, aided in no small part by Johnny Greenwood's understated score, adding a wispy air of paranoia and menace throughout.

So yes, I am rather biased here. That said, I still believe that this is a brilliant, beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and extremely funny movie.

Paul Thomas Anderson has done what no one before has done: transit one of Thomas Pynchon's labyrinthian spaghetti feasts of written words from a book to the screen. And he does it smoothly, with enough wit, intelligence, and detail to make watching the result a pure delight. I not only want to see this film a third time, now (to see what other jokes and nuances I missed; it's PACKED with hilarious and subtle Easter Eggs), I can tell I'll want to do so again many times in the future.

This one deserves a permanent spot on the midnight movie shelf alongside ""Brazil"", ""Repo Man"", and ""Pulp Fiction"".

I now propose that Amazon should commission Anderson to make Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow into a 12-part series. Hey, I'm in Hollywood now, studio time is affordable again with the tax breaks; I'll help, let's do this.",1424649600,21,989,4.672413793103448

6890146,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"I think Anderson is amazing, one of the few directors of our time who can touch film-makers like Kubrick. But while the film is full of wonderful camera-work, production design and performances, and there are some very funny scenes, I couldn't quite get my head around the thing. I get that's the point, and that while Thomas Pynchon's novel has the outer form of a detective story, it's not really about plot but about mood and playful mind-games, details and surreal moments. But somehow the lack of tonal focus made it hard for me to get lost in it's rhythms.

Feeling like a goofy comedy one minute, a subtle satiric elegy for a hippie age that was never quite as fun as we'd like to remember the next, and a story driven detective noir the next, I found myself not getting engaged in the way I kept wanting to.

Given the talents involved, my huge admiration for Anderson, and the generally great critical reaction, I'm open to the idea that I'm missing something. And there are a lot of moments that echo with me, from Josh Brolin's truly gonzo, but yet also somehow understated performance as an uptight, straight-laced cop who is a lot more complex and messed up then he'd like to admit, to the very long single take seduction scene between Joaquin Phoenix and Katherine Waterston that is uncomfortable, sexy, repellent, real, a fantasy and beautifully acted all at the same time.

It's certainly a film worth seeing, but for the first time with an Anderson film I felt locked on the outside looking in, feeling a little sheepish and a little dumb.",1424217600,8,1556,4.650909090909091
6890147,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson has a penchant for creating unconventional characters surrounded by an unconventional atmosphere, guided by a surrealistic narrative.

Whether its delving into a splintered world, observing the lives of an uncanny few (Magnolia, Boogie Nights), or simply witnessing the degradation of a mans moral compass (There Will Be Blood), Anderson never holds back the bizarre and (occasionally) macabre.

He makes weird movies, is what Im saying. His latest film Inherent Vice isn't all that different from the herd.

Centered around a slacker/stoner/hippie/detective named Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), who is also apparently striving to become a homeless John Lennon impersonator, he is suddenly visited by an old friend who requests a favor: Prevent a cheating wife and her lover from putting her real estate mogul husband in a mental asylum.

And thats the only coherent thing youll be able to follow throughout the entire film.

Inherent Vice, in all respects, is basically a reincarnation of The Big Lebowski, in that it features, but is not limited to:

A constantly stoned slacker that seems to have a knack for bad luck.

A in the wrong place at the wrong time scenario.

A slew of outrageous characters with unpredictable behavior.

A neo-noir plot on acid.

Its a summarization of what you're getting, albeit taking place in a 1970s time frame.

That isn't to say that Inherent Vice isn't more than the sum of its own parts. Its just hidden in a mire of confusing story branches, at times incoherent dialogue between cast members, and an overall inconsistent feeling in both tone and quality.

Far from being bad, however difficult and obtuse the plot, it is bolstered by unique and quirky performances from the stable of actors, and the humorous awkward scenarios that they fall into.

Inherent Vice may not be as overly accessible and consistently funny as Lebowski, but it has enough oddball charm and a flair for the strange and unpredictable that it keeps you entertained, if only for the reason to guess what other curveballs its willing to throw at you.",1423180800,4,2095,5.072886297376093
6890148,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"The experience that I had with Inherent Vice was an odd one, but we are talking about Paul Thomas Anderson, so that was certainly expected. From the poster alone - with an afro-bearing Joaquin Phoenix surrounded by a number of the peculiar characters he meets - I figured it would be something unlike most films being released today. And having now seen it, I can confirm that wholeheartedly.

Its a movie that, for the most part, makes up for its flaws in the form of originality and gusto. From the first frame, it knows what it wants to be and continues to stick with that tempo right until the end. Because of this, it won't be for everyone. Its a psychedelic trip of a movie, taking you on a weird and interesting journey that has its fair share of goofy moments and unusual happenings.

The film centers around Doc Sportello (Phoenix), a private investigator who gets quickly wrapped up in the kidnapping case of a local billionaire land developer and briskly begins a search to find him. What he doesnt realize is how hard thats going to be, especially when hes stoned out of his mind half of the time. So through the fog of marijuana and alcohol, he meets eccentric character after eccentric character, all in good fun. Its just about as silly as it gets, but once you're on board you succumb to the charming atmosphere of the whole thing and its weird look at the world. Youve also got a great early 60s and 70s soundtrack that serves as the glue to keep everything together.

Its definitely got several weak points, mostly in the pacing and a few scenes that seemed out of place (particularly when Martin Short shows up), but I liked it quite a bit. I found it refreshing amidst some of the more conventional things Ive seen this year. If you like unordinary, quirky stories then this comes highly recommended.",1422144000,52,1820,4.576687116564417

(ie. after seeing it 2 or 3 more times)

The movie is closely aligned with the book, so if you read it beforehand, as I did in 2009, you will be better able to follow the complex cast of characters and plot lines.  Unfortunately, 5 years has past since I read the book, and I did not retain much of what I read except for the fact that the main character, Doc Sportello (PI, hippy, stoner), lives in the mythical city of Gordita Beach, which is sandwiched somewhere between Manhattan Beach (my hometown) and El Porto...though, now that I think about it, I think it WAS El Porto...as in ""Sporto"" (Doc's nickname).  I also enjoyed the many references to Los Angeles and the timing (1970) which closed the decade of the fun-loving hippies in the sixties with the shocking murders by the Charles Manson clan.

After seeing the movie, I HAD to re-read the book, to understand exactly what the hell happened in the movie.  Now that I have finished reading the book a second time, I am looking forward to my second viewing of the movie.  Again, the movie is an abridged/edited version of the book, but you need to pay close attention to the movie to keep up with the pace.  And the pace and the action stays true to both artists (Writer & Director), so if you are a fan of either Thomas Pynchon or Paul Thomas Anderson, then this is a MUST SEE.  If you love both, well, I can only assume that you're reading this in your quest to fully appreciate the arts, as opposed to hearing my glorious review of the movie.

Now, if you have been patient enough to read this far into my review than you will have the patience for this movie, which takes its time to develop in the cinema,  Upon leaving the theater, I wasn't exactly sure WHAT just happened and I immediately realized that I'd have to see it again to fully appreciate the psychedelic journey that I just experienced.  As they say in the 1960's...if you can remember it, than you weren't really there.

Fortunately, we will ALL be able to relive it, and I am looking forward to owning this movie when it becomes available.

This is one movie that I will be watching over and over and over.

6890152,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"""Eggs break, chocolate melts.""

I've been a Paul Thomas Anderson fan for a very long time, and I stand behind my opinion that he is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. His films always have amazing production value and fantastic casts. I've seen everything he's directed (with the exception of his short, Cigarettes & Coffee, which has proven to be pretty difficult to find), and although I don't like all of his movies (Magnolia, in particular), movies like Boogie Nights and Punch Drunk Love remain some of my favorite films of all time.

Inherent Vice follows the story of a pothead P.I. named Doc Sportello, who traverses 1970's Los Angeles while searching for an old flame. It's an adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name, the first Pynchon novel to make it to the big screen. The recently revived Joaquin Phoenix plays Portello, and he's joined by an amazing cast - Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson, Benecio Del Toro, Katherine Waterson and Reese Witherspoon all show up at various points.

In my opinion, Inherent Vice suffers from the same problem Anderson's last film, The Master, ran into - the parts are greater than the sum. Phoenix, who was also in The Master, clearly carries this film. His performance as Doc Sportello is hilarious as he dons costumes and trades barbs with Josh Brolin's 'Bigfoot', the other acting highlight here. Brolin steals the show in every scene he's in, eating food and kicking down doors. Unfortunately, the story our characters are wrapped up in is a bit convoluted and very, very long. In fact, I wasn't real interested in the story at all, and when it was all wrapped up, the only thing I really cared about was the performances by the actors...the same feeling I had when the credits rolled on The Master. Also, like all Anderson films, Inherent Vice is long - clocking in at two and a half hours.

There are some very funny lines in Inherent Vice, and the 70's atmosphere is presented fantastically, but it just didn't stick with me like I hoped it would. Maybe it deserves a second viewing sometime.

My final score: C+",1421625600,4,2087,4.722527472527473
6890153,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"The adventure starts when Shasta Fay Hepworth (Katherine Waterston) requests the help of private detective Larry ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix). Doc is a hippie who spends most of his time doing drugs. During the film he does alcohol, pot, acid, PCP, and cocaine while trying to solve various cases. Shasta is a former girlfriend who left a few months or a few years ago. She tells Doc she is the girlfriend of a married man Mickey Wolfmann (Eric Roberts in a cameo) and his wife (Serena Scott Thomas) and the wife's boyfriend are scheming to get Mickey committed.

The story then weaves levels of complexity introducing new characters seeming unrelated to anything. Some characters such as ""Bigfoot"" (Josh Brolin) appear as stereotypes on the surface, but underneath the exterior is someone totally unexpected. At times this makes fun of 60's stoner films but maintains Coen Brothers type of humor throughout. The characters are far from stock. There is humor in the notes Doc takes down in his book. There were plenty of WTF moments and ""what the heck am I watching?"" feelings. It is a film you must either be stoned or fully engaged to watch. I would recommend the latter the first time through.

Doc's journey takes him through a dead biker, Mental Asylum (Straight is Hip), Chinese smuggling, Dentist pedophile, massage parlor, and government conspiracy involving the FBI, DOJ and the Aryan Nation. Try to keep up.

This is an oddball cult film that won't appeal to everyone.

6890154,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"I suppose this will be most people's introduction to Thomas Pynchon. I guess this is both good and bad. Its good because this is pretty consistently entertaining (and gives you a kind of thumbnail intro or entree into Pynchon's sordid world of conspiracy theory and sophomoric humor), and its bad because this is not Pynchon at his best. The film is likable enough (all those great actors giving it their all even though none of them except Joaquin get much actual screen time) but its just not particularly deep. The painstaking attention to period costume and interior design and the music is fun (my favorite part of this movie) but the parody of all the cultish/faddish lifestyles and the intertwining politics (each character seems to be playing both sides of the law as well as both sides of the straight/subversive divide) seem overwrought (only the jokes about the LAPD really hit home) while the characters themselves seem undercooked --- more like caricatures in an elaborate joke that packs no real punch. And the noirish voiceover doesn't work at all. ""Shasta"" is an especially unsatisfying character. She is a literary creation, a symbol (like F Scott Fitzgeralds green light) and she feels like a symbol. Although I wanted to like Joaquin's ""Doc Sportello"" the character just doesn't have any strong opinions about anything and his perpetual drug grin just gets kind of old (no matter how much of a hippie you might be). The whole thing is too wacky to serve as any kind of cultural critique. And really the plot is just a re-hash of Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1971) which to my mind is a much better film. I liked it enough to want to see it again when it comes out on DVD but I was disappointed (after my first viewing anyway).

Now if you already love Pynchon you may just enjoy the opportunity to see his humor visualized so lovingly and that may be enough for you. But if you are primarily a PT Anderson fan this is going to feel like a bit of a letdown after There Will Be Blood and The Master. Of course if you didn't really like those two films (because they were too heavy) this film may be exactly what you want.",1421539200,5,2143,4.609947643979058
6890155,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"Is there any mainstream American director as consistently unique and challenging as Paul Thomas Anderson? Only the Coens and Terrence Malick (whenever he finds the time) come close, but I still say PTA is the king. Any time I watch one of his films, my immediate reaction is to watch it again, both out of enjoyment and to better understand the themes. In the case of Inherent Vice, the need to rewatch a movie of his was never so strong.

To sum up the plot in a few sentences would be futile, so instead, I'll tell you the only things you really need to know before seeing Inherent Vice. First of all, don't try too hard to understand every aspect of the plot, or you'll give yourself an aneurysm. Even PTA, the man who adapted the script and directed the film, says he's trying to piece everything together. In pure noir fashion, the audience sees everything through the eyes of the protagonist, therefore only gathering what parts of the story PI Doc Sportello gathers, only catching what we can by peering through a singular keyhole. For a while, things will make sense, but especially in the last 45 minutes, we lose our grasp on the mess of threads and tangents and submit to a head-scratching acceptance. I don't think Inherent Vice is to be taken as a literal, straight-forward story anyhow. It's more impressionist in that it concerns itself with creating an atmosphere over a logical storyline. I mean, the films narrator, Doc's clairvoyant hippie friend, follows him through his foggy journey by what is referred to as doper's ESP. This alone should tell you that Inherent Vice isn't exactly grounded in reality. Beyond the confusing plot, there is still so much to love. Another main focus is Doc's relationship with his ex-lady, Shasta. This is the only facet of the story that Doc actually seems hung up on, and the few scenes that Doc and Shasta have together are as mysterious as they are oddly touching. It should also be said that parts of Inherent Vice are hysterical, other parts are unnerving, but everything, and I mean the entire movie, is infused with a thick air of mystery (and weed smoke, of course), so one has to accept this from the beginning before complaining about it being confusing later.

Even if it's hard to get a solid grasp on what Inherent Vice is about or how it makes you feel, it's easy to appreciate the visual aesthetic PTA created for the time period. Shot in flat aspect ratio with a fine layer of genuine grain, this looks like it could have actually been shot in the 70's, as opposed to say, American Hustle. It has the dark 70's cinematography and some tracking shots that would make his heroes, Altman and Kubrick, proud. Props to Robert Elswit for shooting both Inherent Vice and Nightcrawler in the same year. This also marks the third consecutive collaboration between PTA and Radiohead guitarist/composer Johnny Greenwood. These two really are a match made in heaven. PTA loves making these tense, uncomfortable scenes and Greenwood always knows exactly what kind music would fit perfectly. For my money, he's the most interesting film composer working today. The soundtrack also includes two Neil Young songs, Vitamin C by Can, and a perfectly placed credits song by Chuck Jackson. I sort of expected PTA to provide a more lavish soundtrack like he did in his other retro period- piece, Boogie Nights, but I found the sparing use of pre-recorded music made the songs included all the more special.

Inherent Vice is the first ensemble cast we've seen from a PTA film since Magnolia, and what a cast! Joaquin Phoenix, PTA's new Philip Seymour Hoffman (tears), is brilliant as always. Doc Sportello is a far cry from The Master's uncouth Freddie Quell, but Phoenix manages hippie scum just as well as anything. Given he's the protagonist in a film noir, he really does carry the entire show, and he does so gracefully and with a laid-back charm I've never seen from him. Other highlights include the orally-fixated Josh Brolin, Owen Wilson (please act more!), the gorgeous Katherine Waterston, Benicio Del Toro, Reese Witherspoon, singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom, Jena Malone, Maya Rudolph, the hilarious and amazing Martin Short, and Eric Roberts. A much more mature ensemble than in Magnolia but equally energetic and fun.

Inherent Vice is a film that requires more than one viewing. To completely soak in all of its brilliance, it may even take three or four viewings. Personally, I have no problem with this, but others who require more straightforward stories won't be as willing to sacrifice their time. Despite the mixed reviews, my faith in Paul Thomas Anderson's genius has not been shaken one bit and I cannot wait to watch this film again and again.",1421452800,8,4717,4.8197530864197535
6890156,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"This is a tremendous movie. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a neo-noir tour de force that perfectly portrays the compulsive ""sex, drugs and rock n roll"" infused nineteen seventies that embodies the lost innocence of late Vietnam era and late counter culture period.

There is an eerie reminiscence of David Lynch here (particularly ""Mullholland Drive"" ,"" and the relatively obscure ""Inland Empire""), and even a little bit of the corrupt LAPD  of ""LA Confidential"" and even ""Chinatown"" through the Police Detective character (and others) of BigFoot, played adroitly by Josh Brolin whose marijuana eating episode was hilarious.

The movie, through the first half, seemed to wander and I was wondering if it was going to be a redux of Anderson's  ""The Master"" or Lynch's ""Inland Empire"" that in my opinion, suffered a similar fate. But in the end it was well worth the wait, and the watch and stylistically it had some of the ensemble effects of Anderson's much earlier masterpiece, ""Magnolia.""

I felt the, often poetic and sometimes surreal, omniscient female narrator helped tie together what could have been a disjointed flop. The acting of the anti-hero Joaquin Phoenix also helped create a modicum of cohesion, as the everyman ""private dick"" of the sinful seventies in SoCal at its hedonic height.

His role in someways reminded me of the over the top, out of control sex and drugs (kind of rap singer) role, playing himself, in the documentary ""Over The Top."" I'm Still Here."" But Doc did stay true to his code with the world imploding all around him. Even when he was going super crazy- and super heroic- when he was slipped a joint of PCP and extricated himself from an untimely end at the hands of Tinseltown thugs.

It was nice to see cameos of the masterful Martin Donovan as the corrupt, omnipotent lawyer/father, as it was of Martin Short as the sex and drug obsessed endodontist impresario, and Eric Roberts as the fallen, mad, druggy real estate mogul, Mickey (Wolfman) Wolfson... All appearing in a classic neo-noir ensemble visual narrative.

There are oodles of cinematic pastiche here, and tons of gratuitous sex (I thought Shasta's seduction of Doc had the raw eroticism of Naomi Watts in ""Mullholland Drive""), as there in an underlying irony of the American dream's nightmarish demise.

All in all this film, like the Novels of Thomas Pynchon (e. g.; Gravity's Rainbow)  who wrote ""Inherent Vice,"" this film may seem inaccessible to some, and enigmatic to others, but ultimately tremendously rewarding to those who can follow it to its mildly affirming end. It will never be a favorite of the Oscars politically (rather than aesthetically) infused, and more recently,  correct crowd.

But to me, who came of age, so to speak, during this period, I feel this an exemplary effective work that gives me hope that originality, and artistic honesty still survive, as well as, capturing the essence of the historic and cultural extremes of the late 1960's and 70's...",1421452800,78,2981,4.9758551307847085
6890157,4,B00QXIIZ3W,"Theatrical review.  There could be a spoiler.
Director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson is known for some outrageous films (""Boogie Nights"") as well as some just a bit ""out there"" (""There Will Be Blood""), both of which I loved.  This modern film noir takes place in the Manhattan Beach area of L. A. In 1970.  The era of the hippie has just about shut the door.  Hippies are now ""stoners.""  They're the same people, just a little older and sometimes must work.  One of those people is ""Doc"" Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix), who survives on doing some work as a private investigator.  This is a step up from his previous job as a skip tracer.

While getting high one night, he is visited by his former girlfriend Shasta Fay Hepworth (Sam's daughter, Katherine Waterston in a breakout role).  Before I go much further, one of the great things in this film are the character names, which were created by novelist, Thomas Pynchon.  Shasta needs Doc's help because she's been having an affair with one of the big shots in town, a married real estate developer named Michael Wolfmann (Eric Roberts).  And she fears he may have been kidnapped.

But there's more going on involving neo-Nazi gang bangers, black gang bangers, sleazy drug importing dentists, corrupt FBI and police officials and more.  So much more that I quit trying to follow what was going on about half way through.  My advice?  Do the same.  It really isn't all that important and if you concentrate on it too much, you'll miss some of the great sets, wonderful music, stunning photography and perhaps Joaquin Phoenix's best performance.

There are some other nice performances as well, most notable Josh Brolin as police Lt. Detective Bjornsen, also known as ""Bigfoot.""  He's more interested in busting Doc's nether regions and getting a TV gig than he is about law enforcement.  Other minor rolls with well-known actors include Serena Scott Thomas as Wolfmann's wife Sloane; Maya Rudolph as Doc's receptionist, Petunia; Michael Kenneth Williams as Tariq Khalil, a former gang member; Benicio Del Toro as Sauncho Smilax, Doc's lawyer; Jena Malone and Owen Wilson as Hope and Coy Harlingen, a couple that could be in danger; Reese Witherspoon as an assistant D. A. and sometime Doc paramour and finally Martin Short as Rudy Blatnoyd, a coked up dentist.

I will also alert viewers to the fact that the ""R"" rating isn't to be taken lightly.  There is a scene toward the end of the film with Doc and Shasta.  Her monologue is one of the most erotic few minutes I've ever seen in a mainstream film.  Make no mistake, this movie isn't for everyone, but I sure liked it.  It's funny, provocative and entertaining.",1421366400,85,2661,4.81057268722467
6890158,3,B00QXIIZ3W,"From Warner Bros. is a crime drama that sees a Los Angeles cop whos fueled with drugs to search for a missing person including that of his girlfriend. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, and Katherine Waterston. And the film is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who previously was involved with There Will Be Blood back in 2007.

Aside from the movie lets start with Joaquin Phoenix whos had a tumultuous career ever since the news of his departure from acting and wanting to become a rapper. For a good time his behavior was strange and even outrageous till the point when news broke that the whole act was for a documentary he was doing. So on to Inherent Vice we see Phoenix play the role of Larry Sportello or more commonly known as Doc. His former girlfriend, Shasta (Katherine Waterston), is kidnapped and is searching for her with the aid of Bigfoot played by Josh Brolin. The movie is a combination of a crime drama mixed with comedy and sometimes works to its advantage with plenty of entertainment to go around.

What I liked about the movie was seeing how goofy some of the characters were and the instances where sexual references are used. There were so many times people in the audience were laughing out loud at the outlandish conversations characters would have with one another. One particular scene that just catches you off guard is when a cop car pulls over Docs vehicle while having company. The cop goes on to say why they are being pulled over and that the long hair raised sirens as a connection to the Manson family and there being more then 3 individuals in the car at the same time. Or even a time when Bigfoot eats drugs right off of the ash tray in Docs house. So many off the wall moments that brought the laughs.

The story itself can get confusing at times cause it starts off as a real-estate developer goes missing and then so does Shasta. As Doc is investigating the clues the film sort of loses itself in direction and puts too much on its plate for audiences to stay focused. Yeah there were funny moments and action in-between but I had a hard time mixing the crime drama with it being a comedy as well. By the time the mystery is solved you sort of want to forget how you got to the end in the first place and just accept it because it takes too much to add up all the clues and make sense of it. And it doesnt help either that the runtime on Inherent Vice is nearly 150 minutes. If the film wouldve been trimmed a good 45 minutes it wouldve helped with the pacing and not feel like it dragged at times.

I wasn't disappointed by any of the performances by the actors; including those of Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin. Even the smaller roles by Reese Witherspoon and Eric Roberts were okay to watch cause of how at ease they were in these kinds of films. Were there breakout stars? No, however you appreciated the chemistry by everyone and the level of talent there was by high caliber actors. There shouldve been more scenes with Reese Witherspoon and Eric Roberts in my opinion as I wouldve liked to have seen them have more screen time; especially the case with the man gone missing, Michael Z. Wolfmann (Eric Roberts). You see photos of him in newspapers and tabloids but then just one scene involving Doc and Wolfmann after being found at a facility.

The movie may not court to the casual movie goer just because the material is a mixture of comedy and drama that may not work for everyone. But for those who are into spoofs and are fans of Josh Brolin may find Inherent Vice a pleasurable experience. Although a little too long and off-paced the movie is still enjoyable as youll get good laughs just as much.",1421107200,2,3685,4.469539375928678
6890159,2,B00QXIIZ3W,"Two and a half hours of plot that barely creeps along. I don't care if the acting was good, I need something to keep me awake in the theater and this just wasn't doing it. And what exactly was accomplished in this movie anyway? I just watched it I'm not even sure i know what this movie was about. Screw you movie trailer for giving me average expectations.",1421107200,,357,4.264705882352941

6890161,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"With this ambitious wonderland adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel Inherent Vice, writer and director Paul Thomas Anderson has crafted a special film.  His best since Magnolia, it is at once grim, hilarious, extremely confounding, and entirely satisfying, and it has an amazing feeltactile, sensual, even olfactoryfor the world and time its characters inhabit.  The many-tentacled storyline turns on ""Doc"" (Joaquin Phoenix), a long-haired, dazed-and-partly-confused private eye living by the beach in L.A. as the 1960s harshly give way to the '70s.  An old flame (Katherine Waterston) urges him to investigate a plot to steal the fortune of her new lover, a real-estate magnate briefly played by Eric Roberts, and soon our intrepid, pot-smoking hero is caught in a menacing and psychedelic web of dentists, maritime lawyers, musicians, Nazis, policemen, and other madcap fiends and players.  Who is conspiring with whom, and can the well-intentioned, self-medicating ""Doc"" trust his own senses?

Simple point-A-to-point-B solutions are not among this film's chief concerns, though sober skeptics are wrong to say it is completely devoid of the teasing, satisfying twists and turns of a traditional mystery story.  They are present amidst a veritable treasure trove of distinctive characters, inspired comic set pieces, astrological voice-over musings, tasteful flourishes of period-conjuring art direction, and a certain air of the apocalyptic as peace-and-love remembrance gives way to paranoia, the specter of Charles Manson, and the existential threat represented by land-developing squares and police-department bureaucracy.  Phoenix is as ever a game and adventurous leading man.  As ""Doc,"" he subdues his natural tendency toward inward or even implosive intensity to deliver a loose, sweet performances as this unworldly, yet strangely clever surf detective.  He is provided vibrant aid by an extensive cast with many standouts, including the enigmatic, sexy Waterston and a scene-stealing Josh Brolin as an antagonistic and tightly wound cop with a demeanor as severe as his high-and-tight haircut.",1421107200,6,2108,5.7092651757188495
8693217,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"The movie is based off the Thomas Pynchon novel of the same name. Pynchon is an amazing writer but it takes someone with more smarts to get his work. This is one of my favorite movies. Its a neo-noir with atmosphere. Doc Sportello, a small time P.I. with big connections is home when his ex girlfriend shows up with a problem that her current lover who is a real estate big shot is in trouble because his wife is trying to commit him to a loony bin to make off with his fortune. Doc navigates the world of heroin cartels making money with the product and the medical work that comes with getting clean, Nazis, crazy corrupt police all the while trying to find his ex gf who has now gone missing with her real estate bf. Its a fun ride that is long but doesnt overstay his welcome. A lot of people don't like it because its not all wrapped up in a bow and figured out. You have to watch it more than once to get it all and you will love it the more you watch it.",1532822400,,961,4.063157894736842
8693218,5,B00QXIIZ3W,"In 1963, before Pynchon's Inherent Vice and 'Doc' Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix in Paul Thomas Anderson's faithful film version), there was Oedipa Maas in Pynchon's 'The Crying of Lot 49.' Both Doc and Oedipa are investigating strange goings-on in Southern California, and both have developed a well-deserved paranoia about the corruption and violence they are discovering, such as neo-Nazi thugs, unsolved murders, corrupt cops, and powerful real-estate developers who got rich turning SoCal deserts into vast tracts of houses and strip malls. Oedipa really just wants to figure out what is happening to her marriage (to 'Mucho' Maas, a DJ for an underground radio channel in the Bay Area, who is chasing after his young female fans), but an earlier short affair in Mazatln with Pierce Inverarity, the developer - who just wanted her for sex, sound familiar? - turns into a state-wide investigation when Pierce walks into the ocean one evening and never returns, having named Oedipa as the Executor of his vast estate, and Oedipa soon discovers secret links between some odd engineers at the SoCal Yoyodyne (think Rocketdyne) complex and a 16th Century private postal service with a violent past and a suspicious present (their symbol is a muted trumpet horn). Oedipa never does solve the mystery of the private post and its sinister connections with the Yoyodyne group, but she finds something in herself, something beyond her Grad School training in 17th-century English literature, that allows her to soldier on and figure out just enough about these mysterious events to overcome (somewhat) her fear of the nameless dread that pervades her (and everyone else in SoCal's) existence.

There's a dread pervading the 1970 SoCal beach culture, too, part of it's the never-ending Vietnam War and the vicious culture war against the youth movement being waged for political purposes by Nixon and his conservative base, and part of it's fear of having your door broken down for smoking pot by Lt. 'Bigfoot' Bjornsen (Josh Brolin); but living at La Playa (the beach) in west LA, Doc and his hip friends get dragged into the murky, scary world of Golden Fang drug dealers and corrupt cops and their hired assassins when Doc is approached by former girlfriend Shasta Fay (the lovely Katherine Waterston) to solve the mystery of the sudden disappearance of her billionaire boyfriend, who Doc eventually finds out has been sequestered by the FBI at a fancy rehab clinic because he was planning to give away free housing to atone for what he now sees was his excessive greed - that must mean he's crazy, right?

With a little help from his friends, Doc solves the mystery of what happened to Shasta Fay's billionaire boyfriend 'Mickey' Wolfmann (Eric Roberts), and narrowly escapes the harsh consequences of messing with the Golden Fang's product. In an ironic twist, Shasta Fay returns to Doc's arms, but this is the free-love 1970's in SoCal, so Doc tells her ""this doesn't mean we're back together"" - but of course they are back together, and all will turn out fine so long as each of them stays true to their hip creed and avoids the corrupting lure of money and greed.",1532131200,,3161,4.984848484848484
