4125908,3,B003HKN51G,"I was expecting more of HD concert footages on Elvis on tour but it seems mostly scene of Elvis getting in and out of cars, airplanes, and concert halls. The concert footages are also mostly edited into montage which seems distracting because too many scenes of fans cheering and getting histerical. It may be the intension of the editor who tried to present whole Elvis experience but in my pointof view it was poorly excuted.

Also, the documentary seems it is not really HD in may parts. It only uses part of screen so it appeals that pictures are little clearer. Some people can be really annoyed by this. The movie footages and small portion of concert used in documentary are HD though.

I guess if you are die hard Elvis fan and loves any Elvis stuff they throw at you, you will love this but it was not for me.

The good thing about this package is that it includes two Blu-ray movies discs that makes up for disppointment of the documentary.",1281139200,12,950,4.479768786127168

8397132,4,B003HKN51G,I have seen Elvis on Tour but my favorite Elvis concert movie is hands down-Elvis That's the Way it is. I have watched it everyday for 2 weeks. Regarding all the comments on how bad he looked-there was a VERY GOOD REASON; he had bone cancer that spread thruout his entire body as well as an enlarged heart that his mother had. He was very sick that last year. To learn more check out the documentary by his best friend/Charlie Hodge. Its on you tube.,1497571200,3,450,4.305882352941176

8397136,4,B003HKN51G,Jailhouse and Viva Las Vegas were very good movies. Elvis On tour... not so much. His decline was quite evident in this documentary due to the over abundance of drugs he was taking,1477267200,,180,4.484848484848484
8397137,5,B003HKN51G,"Awesome set. Forgot how good Jailhouse Rock was.  Now, where the _____ are the rest of the good movies? King Creole? Loving You? Frankie and Johnny?",1471305600,,148,4.6923076923076925
8397138,5,B003HKN51G,"My daughter and I only wish they would publish the entire Elvis catalogue on Blu Ray. These films look much better than the DVD versions. I wouldn't say they are ""restored"" but they are much cleaner, with better color and clarity.",1464220800,6,230,4.634146341463414
