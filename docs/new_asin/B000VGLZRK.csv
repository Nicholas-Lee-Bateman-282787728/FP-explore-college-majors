2941455,5,B000VGLZRK,Tai Chi is a time tested means for achieving balance and harmony within. Stephanie guides you through the steps effortlessly. For those of us curious to know it is informative. For those of us who want to learn her guidance is seamless. The tape is a must have for beginners as well as those who have strayed. Effects are felt after a few practice sessions. A good Chi experience . A great homage to the Chows....I hope the next CD is coming soon.......,1198368000,9,453,4.469879518072289
2941456,5,B000VGLZRK,"Tai chi is not an easy movement to teach on a dvd (I've bought many dvds in the past)... however, Tai Chi for Enlighteners breaks down every step so I understood where I needed to be in the movements.
I found the companion book helpful since it introduces the beginner to this esoteric, healing art form in easy to understand parables. It's obvious that Stephanie is a passionate teacher who wants to share her unique take on tai chi.
The first dvd has a seated relaxation and that alone was worth the price.
Please note that even though Tai Chi for Enlighteners was first marketed for people 50 years and older ~ it works for all ages. I'm in my mid-thirties. And there's a supportive website where I heard Stephanie's teachers Mr. and Mrs. Chow's delightful interchange and explanation about Wu Form Tai Chi. (website: enlighteners.com)
I highly recommend this program.",1286582400,,871,4.774834437086093
2941457,5,B000VGLZRK,"I always wanted to try Tai Chi, and didn't know where to start.  This DVD turned out to be the perfect solution for me, a beginner, because the book that comes with it gave me information about Wu Tai Chi and what to expect, as well as the background of the teacher, Stephanie, and what started her on this journey.
  Each lesson is taught in a way that is so easy to follow. By watching Stephanie and following her step by step instructions, I easily learned the movements.  The advantage of having a DVD is that you can stop and review a lesson as much as you like, and then go on to the next lesson when you feel ready.
  Tai Chi has helped my balance, improved my memory, and helped me deal with the stress of work and being a busy mom.  When I am using the Tai Chi DVD, I feel relaxed and in a zone just following the flow of movements and steps.  If I happen to get up early, I can practice my lessons before work, or sometimes I have more time at the end of my day. I'm so glad I tried it.
  Get the DVD and try it yourself and see how wonderful you'll begin to feel  practicing Tai Chi at home at your own pace.",1247443200,2,1119,3.9954954954954953
2941458,5,B000VGLZRK,"Stephanie Rosenblatt is an amazing Tai Chi teacher, and this DVD is a wonderful way to begin learning. I have been doing yoga for 20 years, since starting college, and as I have progressed in my mind-body practices it has become more and more apparent that a more yin approach to working within my body brings me more into my power. When I am in my power, I am more flexible, more energetic - overall in wonderful health.
I knew for a while that I wanted to learn Tai Chi, but finding a good teacher was very important to me. I feel extremely fortunate to have found Stephanie and also incredibly thankful that she put together this DVD. In this DVD, Stephanie walks through the steps perfectly, and the music and backdrop are well suited to the material. To get your mind working in a Tai Chi frame can be challenging at first, but her technique and consistency in verbal cues create a very fluid teaching modality that allows the student to learn Tai Chi very quickly.
The effects? Unbelieveable! The very subtle moves in Stephanie's Wu style are a technique that will be with anyone for life. They are movements that allow for a great amount of physical stretching, balance and coordination while at the same time are in a small radius of the actual human body making it a style that we will be able to use as we age and other means of balance become more challenging. I have had a longtime issue of right hip, neck and shoulder tension that Tai Chi with Stephanie has allowed me to explore more on an energetic level. As I open the energetic channels through the loving patience of Tai Chi, my stength and power in my personal, professional and...if you will...my yoga life have exponentially expanded. I often times hold the Tai Chi moves when I feel the stuck energy in my body in certain movements, much like one would hold moves in a Yin Yoga class. The release is really amazing. I feel alive, refreshed and deeply connected to my environment after doing Tai Chi. I highly recommend Tai Chi for Enlighteners.

2941459,5,B000VGLZRK,"I really wanted to explore a meditative movement exercise so I went online and did a search.  I found this program, Tai Chi for Enlighteners, Enlighteners being age 50 and over. After researching her work and watching the YouTube videos, I excitedly ordered Stepahnie Rosenblatt's DVDs with the companion book.

Stephanie has 35 years practice and she says, ""Tai Chi not only improves physical balance but it also creates an inner journey that initiates healing on all levels: emotional, mental and spiritual. The Tai Chi for Enlighteners program is more than moving the body. It can touch our souls. Tai chi is an amazing pathway to infinite discoveries.""

Below are two YouTube Videos showing part of her Tai Chi for Enlighteners program.

They can be seen here:[...]

Stephanie has offered to join in on speaker phone during one of our
meetings to give us some tips on Tai Chi. I will schedule that with her
soon. Stephanie also joined our Meetup group for emails and discussions on the message board. This will be very helpful because we are new to Tai Chi, and she can personally answer any of our questions.  Now if that is not superior customer service, I don't know what is!  Stephanie, thank you for your support coming all the way from California to Texas!

I highly recommend this program, especially for beginners.",1230681600,9,1465,4.91869918699187
2941460,5,B000VGLZRK,I have used tai chi for enlighteners for just a short time but it has already proven to be very helpful to me.  I received the manual and DVD just before my father-in-law was hospitalize in another state with a very serious illness.  Upon returning home and starting to use Stephanie's tai chi for enlighteners I found it helped me to calm down after several very stressful weeks.  I am already making better decisions about various aspects of my life.  Do read the manual first before starting the DVDs as Stephanie suggests.,1214438400,12,526,4.684782608695652
2941461,5,B000VGLZRK,"Review sent to Stephanie and submitted by PENNY MAcKAY (residing in United Kingdom)
Clinical Herbalist, Qigong Therapist, Kundalini Yoga Teacher, Teacher of the Medicine Buddha

Stephanie taught me Wu style Tai Chi in the Caribbean more than 15 years ago and I loved it.  What seems a lifetime of experience later, I was drawn to see if I could reconnect with  Stephanie and relearn the form.  What a delight it was to discover that she had produced a DVD. And what a remarkable DVD it is.  If you've ever tried to follow a sequence of moves from someone facing you and get mixed up with left and right you'll love this.

Stephanie has reversed her movements so all you have to do follow. She's also, without compromising the integrity of the form, simplified and broken down the steps of the learning process into manageable chunks. I'm truly impressed with her skill!  The DVD is a superb review if you're taking lessons but you're no way deprived if you wish to go it alone without a teacher.

A few words on Wu style Tai-Chi.  I've learned many different ways to connect with one's core being - different forms of yoga, meditation, qigong - but there's something very special about Wu style tai-chi. It very quickly takes me to a place of calmness and grounding.  One round in the morning and I'm set to face the day.",1213315200,6,1321,4.582978723404255
2941462,5,B000VGLZRK,"Tai Chi for Enlighteners is by far the best ""self~teach"" dvd I have ever used.  Stephanie's gentle teaching of the Wu style of Tai Chi is a wonderful way to REALLY learn Tai Chi. Her knowledge, learned from Mr. and Mrs. Chow, is a beautiful style of the art.  I am a student of Stephanie's and I find the dvd a great way to Master the steps at home.  I highly recommend this dvd to anyone that is interested in learning Tai Chi.  It also makes a great gift to anyone that wants to share the benefits from all the healthy side affects of the practice, of which there are so many!",1203984000,9,578,4.133928571428571
2941463,5,B000VGLZRK,"""Tai Chi for Enlighteners"" is an amazing program for anyone beginning Tai Chi or learning the Wu Style Tai Chi.  Stephanie led me through the steps in an easy to follow routine as I practiced with her DVD. I appreciate how each lesson builds upon the previous one and found the repetition helpful with my retention of the patterns. My posture and flexibility have improved and I am more conscience of how I move in my everyday life since doing the program. I recommended the DVD to a dear friend of mine in her 80's. She began the DVD after injuring her wrists and hands.  She told said she feels more balanced and stands and walks with improved posture since beginning the program. I highly recommend this program for anyone wanting to improve their health, flexibility and well being.",1200441600,19,786,4.64748201438849
2941464,5,B000VGLZRK,"How exciting to finally find an EXCELLENT DVD program that only promotes health as we try to age graciously.  Master Tai Chi teacher, Stephanie brings her incredible knowledge to us and has simplified the steps needed to easily understand and learn what I now call, 'The Dance of Health'.  I highly recommend men and women to purchase ""Tai Chi for Enlighteners"",  for it most likely will be the best investment they could make in their lifetime.",1199923200,6,445,4.828947368421052
2941465,5,B000VGLZRK,"This is the best ""how to"" program I have ever tried. The instructor explains every movement in easy to follow detail. She is graceful to watch, and very motivating. After a few lessons, I already feel a better sense of balance. I recommend this program to everyone with an interest in tai chi, and / or achieving balance and a sense of well being. This instructor is a born teacher.",1198972800,12,382,4.4714285714285715
8218595,2,B000VGLZRK,"For me, the quality of the DVD is poor, as in it stopped time after time. The actual instruction was good, but the quality of the physical product was poor.",1425340800,,156,4.233333333333333
8218596,5,B000VGLZRK,"This is a great DVD! Well organized w.  step by step instructions what are easy to follow.
The pace is reasonable for beginners w enough repetition to master the steps in teach sequence w/o becoming overwhelmed.",1370390400,,211,4.861111111111111
8218597,5,B000VGLZRK,"I have taken Tai Chi classes which I found to be slow going.
Having your own teacher on tap with as many repetitions as need is very effective.",1361145600,,143,4.142857142857143
8218598,4,B000VGLZRK,"Though the rest of my family is exploring other styles of Tai Chi, I've begun with Wu style. The person teaching the class I'm taking was taught by Stephanie and recommended this DVD to help enrich the learning experience.  I borrowed a copy to take with on a recent trip, and found it quite helpful.  While I look forward to the day when my moving meditation flows more easily, this is helping me move gently on the path. I'm not very far along, but have found that the DVD is both clear and helpful in both prompting and teaching me this particular form.  Stephanie starts each lesson with a detailed demonstration of the steps of that lesson, then uses the counting technique to recall each step, and ends each lesson with a summary of the form to that point. While I find my movements are still somewhat choppy, I am able to recall each movement via counting, and hope to evolve into a more flowing and natural movement - moving meditation. I have looked at other videos online, though not tried them, but selected this one because it is the direct lineage of my teacher. When I have completed the lessons offered, I will try to come back to edit this review.  My biggest frustration is that with a DVD there can be no feedback to the user on what you are doing right and wrong, and I don't have mirrors in the house to practice in front of. It's nice that I do have the option for a local class to help alleviate that frustration. The DVD is nice to have for travel and home practice. I wish it went beyond the 16 lessons, as I intend to learn the entire form, and will miss having the reinforcement from the DVD.",1347062400,2,1618,4.347682119205298
8218599,5,B000VGLZRK,"I am not one to follow through on exercise DVDs, but this one is a gem. I am a good 15 years younger than the target audience but my body has responded as if it was made for me. I really don't like anything ""new age"" or phony, but this instructor has a genuine respect for the practice and a genuine desire to teach, and that authenticity comes through in each lesson. It's so much easier to trust and follow a teacher who is coming from a desire to share their love of the art. I also appreciate someone who goes slow because I am not the most coordinated person so I can relax and take it at a pace that is challenging but never taxing. I love this DVD awhile I am practicing and I love it even more when I catch myself walking around and feel my skeleton and my center of gravity float effortlessly and weightlessly - just for a moment - I think having harnessed my raw human energy. The effects are profound. I would recommend this DVD/download to anyone. Thank you Stephanie!",1323129600,4,980,4.245989304812834
8218600,5,B000VGLZRK,"Although I had done yoga,I had never tried Tai Chi before I received Stephanie Rosenblatt's ""Tai Chi for Enlighteners"" as a birthday gift.  Her instructions are so easy to follow that I quickly found myself thoroughly enjoying my daily tai chi session. So much so, that I invited two friends to join me one day and both subsequently bought their own DVD's. I believe my balance has greatly improved since I started and I am amazed how I have steadily improved under her gentle  guidance.  I strongly recommend ""Tai Chi for Enlighteners"", whatever your age or physical ability.",1307059200,,576,4.857142857142857

8218603,5,B000VGLZRK,"I was first exposed to Tai Chi at age 37 but I was a ""meditator"" at the time and didn't try to learn the movements until age 60.  The class I attended was overcrowded for the space available and the instructor, although knowledgeable, was somehow not able to complete each lesson in the time alloted.  As a result I and my adult daughter quit after 4 or 5 weeks.  This DVD and book are absolutely what I wanted and after one month of doing the lessons (no I'm not close to finishing, yet) I ordered a copy for my daughter.  At age 72+ I'm finally learning Tai Chi from an obviously accomplished instructor.
UPDATE 9/24/2012...19 months later and 5 to 6 days a week, 15-20 minutes per day.  Works very well for improved balance, flexibility and centering.  Still 5 stars.  Thank you Stephanie.
UPDATE #2 12/7/2013...Coming up on 3 years of, now 7 days a week.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I certainly would.  If at all interested in Tai Chi and it's benefits; this is very worthwhile.",1298332800,2,992,4.406593406593407
8218604,5,B000VGLZRK,"Tai chi for Enlighteners is the quality instructional DVD I was looking for to supplement my regular tai chi classes.  Stephanie's teaching style is extremely appealing.  The format, pace, and production quality allow one to learn the techniques easily, and the repetition that reinforces the lesson is built right in.  The fitness and stretching applications are evident, while the awareness that one is learning a martial art is maintained.",1288483200,4,442,5.3768115942028984
