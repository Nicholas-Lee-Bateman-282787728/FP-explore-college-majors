7927901,4,B00004Z1G5,"James Gandolfini's first movie. He was obviously just starting acting but it has a different type of story, decent acting, but just a good movie all around.",1413244800,4,156,4.814814814814815
7927902,2,B00004Z1G5,"I was attracted to this film because it stars Rita Moreno. Well, ""stars"" is kind.  She must have needed a fast buck, and makes a small appearance.  I have been in love with her since she first sang on a  rooftop in West Side Story. Those days are gone.  Ms. Moreno sadly looks a  little long in the tooth.  Perhaps she could succeed the late Clara Peller  if Wendy's ever revives the ""Where's The Beef"" ads.
It also has  James Gandolfini, of the Sopranos.  Sadly, neither actor made much of an  impression on this reviewer and both are wasted. Mr. Gandolini is miscast;  he is fortunate The Sopranos can help him leave this Turkey Italiano off  his resume.
This is clearly a low budget film, and looks it.  This is  why few may have heard of ITALIAN MOVIE (and deservedly so).
The plot is  convoluted, and not worth explaining.  Visually, it appears to have been  filmed through cheesecloth.  It is sloppily lit, and proceeds at an  escargot's pace.
What is remarkable, however, is the quality of the  soundtrack. The majority of the money spent on this film must have been on  the remarkable soundtrack.
The sound reverberates with excitement, like  the plaintive cry of an antelope on a crystal clear arctic night.
It is  amazing what has been done with so little.  This reviewer hopes the sound  engineer responsible for this small miracle has the opportunity to work on  a major film.  I can only imagine what could be created by this person.  At  the very least, it saves this film.
Although ITALIAN MOVIE is frequently  unwatchable, at least it is listenable.
KUDOS to the sound genius.  It  is a shame the Oscar nominating committee overlooked this person.",945648000,11,1663,4.666666666666667
