7366573,4,B013JB2MA2,"I thought the film, FOREVER, was beautifully done. It's not for everyone, however, as the subject matter is pretty dark and depressing. The actors were all very good, especially Luke Grimes as ""Charlie"" and Deborah Ann Woll as ""Alice"", where the two of them meet again after starring in TRUE BLOOD, together. There's not enough time for all of the characters to have been fully developed, but the ones that were, I really did care about what happened to them. I hate it when people give away the entire plot or even most of it, as I think what we're supposed to be doing when we all review a movie for Amazon, is just give our opinions, impressions and tell the other people who may choose to watch the movie, what we thought about it. Is it a good story or a terrible one? What made it good, etc.,?
Personally, I really enjoyed this film from start to finish and I thought the plot, the writing, the actors, the direction and the cinematography were all very well done. The cinematography ""feels"" a bit dark and sad, as well, which lends itself perfectly alongside the film. As I said before, it IS a sad movie, so if you don't like sad movies without the happy endings then you should probably pass on this one. But, it's not so depressing a movie that it will ruin your day, either. It's a film that is very thoughtful and quiet, but never boring.",1446854400,5,1350,4.42570281124498

7366576,5,B013JB2MA2,"After a shocking and mesmerizing beginning, ""Forever"" will take you to a Twilight-Zone sort of world, where a collection of misfits and bewildered souls have chosen to live out their lives in an old house in the country.

Daredevils's Deborah Ann Woll and Fifty Shades of Grey's Luke Grimes are superb in this film that may evoke the TV series ""Lost,"" without the plane crash. Be warned - the end of the film is more than a little disconcerting!",1444176000,5,445,4.632911392405063
8727978,4,B013JB2MA2,"An usual film, with a number of missteps, but still an interesting to film to watch.  It puts forth a question that feels worth examing.  The question of whether it should be up to an individual to decide when and how to end their life.  Only a handful of characters get any sort of background and explanation, and I think that's one of the films failings, but the stories we do get glimpses of carry weight.  Deborah Ann Woll does a fine job as the central character of Alice.  First using the excuse of being on a story, we soon find out that she's really trying to discover who she is in the wake of her boyfriends suicide.  The relationship that develops between Alice, and Charlie, beautifully played by Luke Grimes, feels too fast.  But the chemistry between the actors helps bring it around so that the ending feels earned and satisfying.  This film is a downer, with a languid pace, but I think its worth a viewing.  And the music is great.",1529798400,,948,4.433526011560693

There was some really depressing aspects of it, and if it weren't so interesting and Freaky Deaky, I wouldn't have liked it because of the depressing parts.",1472774400,,189,4.757575757575758

8727983,2,B013JB2MA2,"Dreary and pretentious drivel about a reporter named Alice (Deborah Ann Woll) whose boyfriend kills himself.  Shortly afterwards she travels to a strange clinic in the middle of nowhere that she was told about during an interview for a prospective story earlier on that tragic day.  Is Alice going for a story or because she hopes the clinic (which is located in a large residential home rather than a professional building) will help her deal with her grief?  Either way, she's warned early on by another inhabitant that the clinic is really a death cult and that everyone living in the house will kill themselves.  The terminally ill woman implores Alice to leave while she can.

The acting in Forever is extremely good.  Deborah Ann Woll, who played the sweet baby vampire Jessica on True Blood, gives easily her strongest performance to date as the grieving and vulnerable reporter.  The problem is that Forever never bothers to set up its world in a believable manner, unlike similarly themed movies like Martha Marcy May Marlene, Holy Ghost People and The Sacrament.  How did these specific and diverse people end up members of a death cult in the middle of nowhere?  We know they all suffered tragedies but that doesn't explain how they came to be in that house, which wasn't easy for Alice to find.  And if the group is masquerading as a psychological clinic where are the superficial elements that would make that believable to outsiders who might become curious?  The whole thing just feels half-baked, to say the least, compared with Martha Marcy May Marlene, which depicted beautifully how a vulnerable person could be drawn into a cult with a charismatic leader and The Sacrament, which dramatised a Jonestown-like mass suicide in a horrific but meticulous and entirely believable manner.

Forever might make you sad, but the movie likely won't stick with you for very long--it's little more than shallow misery porn made watchable by the strong efforts of its cast.  If you want to be genuinely haunted and disturbed by this type of subject matter then you need to watch something else.",1463443200,,2100,4.898305084745763
8727984,3,B013JB2MA2,"This was a great premise that could have been executed better. The idea of a commune for grieving people and a charismatic psychiatrist who may or may not be brainwashing them was very interesting to me. Add an investigative journalist to the mix, and it sounds like a fantastic thriller. That's how the movie was described, and so that's what I expected. But it wasn't--in fact, there were no real villains, just people who made unconventional choices for themselves. Unfortunately, this interesting aspect of the story served as little more than a backdrop for the romance brewing between the two main characters, and I didn't find the romance to be that intriguing. The male lead behaved like an immature teenager throwing tantrums most of the time and didn't seem like a realistic match for an intelligent, career-oriented woman in her twenties. (Picture Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, only Mr. Rochester is much younger with different baggage. I never liked Rochester and thought Jane could do better, so it's not surprising I was no fan of this romance.)

So is this worth watching? Yes, if you can see it on Amazon Prime or Netflix. I don't feel that my time was wasted. If you're a fan of unconventional romances you may enjoy this more than I did.",1459209600,2,1254,4.805555555555555
