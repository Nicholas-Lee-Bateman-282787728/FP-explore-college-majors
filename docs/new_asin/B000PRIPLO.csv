Plot is somewhat nonsensical and the movie comes off like something made for Youtube by a group of eager friends. Would be great for those late nights you come home drunk as hell but don't want to crash in your bed yet. Otherwise stay far away.",1299456000,2,400,4.647887323943662
8193005,2,B000PRIPLO,"if you want to see some japanese anime to be transformed into real-person movie, then this cheesy movie is definitely for you. leave your logic, reasoning, sanity and whatever you usually thought normally human out of the door, enter into this new generation of crazy japanese movies heavily affected by their animation comic books. there're so many movie like this being made and produced not just in japan now, it's like plague, even the third world movie industries are making them now. watch it like watching cartoon movies, then you'd be fine.",1180828800,3,548,4.967391304347826
