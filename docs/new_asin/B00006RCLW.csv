1788960,5,B00006RCLW,"I was so excited to see some of the episodes from the tv show, The Black Stallion (done by the family channel in the '90s) are now on DVD.  Growing up, the Black Stallion was my favorite tv show!  When I saw this DVD I couldn't resist and I'm so glad I bought it!  The theme song for the show gave me goose bumps and brought back so many childhood memories.  I hope they put ALL the episodes on DVD- I will buy them all!!",1109721600,5,421,3.9176470588235293
1788961,1,B00006RCLW,"I mistakenly purchased this DVD thinking it was the 1979 version by Frances Ford Coppola. I was very disappointed in this series of shorts of The Black Stallion produced for the Family Channel. This may good for children but for someone who was looking for the mystical and beautiful film that moved me in my childhood, it was an extremely poor imitation. What really irks me is the fact that nowhere does the product information explain that it is not the film of the same name done so well in 1979. I shoulda looked closer and I will next time. Just because its name is The Black Stallion based on the book by Walter Farley,  starring Mickey Rooney does not make it the classic from 1979 produced by Frances Ford Coppola.",1109635200,27,723,4.519083969465649
1788962,1,B00006RCLW,Poor story line and just plain bad acting.  The only one with any sense in the movie is the horse and he wasn't on camera most of the time.,1080432000,9,139,3.793103448275862
1788963,5,B00006RCLW,"This is not the orignal Black Stallion movie, but the series called the Adventures of the Black Stallion that aired back on the Family Channel back in the early 90's. The show was unfortunatly cancelled when the Family Channel was purchased by another TV company. It stars Mickey Rooney reprising his role from the movie and Richard Cox playing Alec Ramsay. It's 90 minutes long and in it, The Black is entered in the French race Prix de Chantilly, and Alec's friend Nicole (Marianne Filali) returns home to see her sick mother, while Alec and Henry deal with crooked gamblers and bad businessmen who try to fix the race. If you loved the Adventures of the Black Stallion, this DVD is for you!",1045008000,33,693,4.642276422764228
1788993,3,B00006RCLW,I was sad to find out that when i got the third season The Black stallion to find the the 1st disc was covered in this movie. Thinking it was a new movie based off the T.V show. But at the same time i did enjoy the movie anyway.,1213920000,,228,3.673469387755102
1788994,5,B00006RCLW,"First of all the horse that plays the Black in the tv show is Docs Keepin' Time (Justin). He played Black Beauty in the most recent version. He is an American Quarter horse, not a Fresian. While it is true that the tv show did not stay true to the books they are still nice to watch. If you want to rag on anything then rag on the Young Black Stallion. That movie definity did not come anywhere close to the book like the two original films. I have read every one of Walter Farleys books and I also know that when a movie or book is made for tv it very rarely stays the same because there is ussualy more happening and over a longer period of time(seasonwise) on tv then in the books that are based on one event. So over a hundred tv shows were made but only about 25 books. You do the math and figure thngs out. All in all I enjoy the tv series but I will always love Cass O'le as the Black...BTW, in the Young Black Stallion the painted a bay arabian, at least in the tv show the used a black horse with limited white on him.",1187049600,,1027,3.9902912621359223
1788995,1,B00006RCLW,"This does not seem to be the original Tv show I watched as a kid. It does have some of the same characters, but the most important character, The Black, is replaced with a different breed and Alec doesn't even remember that the horse originally came from the Arabian desert. this video should not even be called The black stallion.",1179360000,,331,4.533333333333333
1788996,1,B00006RCLW,"Like many others, I mistakenly thought I was ordering the sumptious 1979 Carroll Ballard adaptation of the famous Walter Farley book starring Kelly Reno, Terri Garr, and a younger (better) Mickey Rooney.

This is NOT that movie!

This is a cheap, poor quality 'made for TV' type of film that is terrible in all respects: terrible acting (a definite blot on Mickey Rooney's resume), terrible casting (no one was really likeable), poor plot, poor image quality. Even the horses were nothing like the first, and you can see the bad paint job on the brown horse that Alec was riding as The Black. They even started a subplot where The Black's son Black Tide was stolen, but the movie never returned to it -- At the end of the film no one has even wondered where the horse went!

I had been hoping to at least see beautiful scenery and animals, but alas, this DVD was so bad I was embarrassed to have bought it -- so embarrassed that I won't even give it to my friend at work for the kids to watch.

Hold out for the more expensive, genuine 1979 cinema release The Black Stallion. That one is worth every penny you'll have to spend.",1178928000,,1127,4.429951690821256
1788997,3,B00006RCLW,This was pretty good for a series and it is still horses that i enjoy watching.,1178928000,,79,4.0
1788998,5,B00006RCLW,"Seeing some of these reviews that people have left, apparently they can not read the title, it's description/synopsys nor research what they are wanting BEFORE purchasing! *eyeroll*

This series spin-off of ""The Black Stallion"" movie is reffered to as ""The New Adventures of The Black Stallion"". This series, as stated from the reviewer posted bellow me, was shown on the cable station (in the USA) The Family Channel. (I didn't know that this station got bought out, thank you for this information. *sob* ) This spin-off series was wonderful watching for the entire family and I recomend it! It continues the story of Alec and the Black into their new racing lives together with their trainer Henry. Along the way they encounter new enemies, threats, families and friends. One friend being Nicole and her endless search for her father and mother. Toward the end of one of the seasons, this friendship between Alec and Nicole turns into something more. Sadly the series just dissapeared before that part of the story could develop. Each episode had good plots, storyline growth, 'keep your attention' scenes, beautiful local filming, along with morals to each story with a good Christian base/family ethics. Some very well known actors/tress star in this story as well as the horse that stars as the Black whom was trained by the same famous trainer that trained the Black that starred in both movies and countless other well-known horse stars! I was very sadden to see this series go in the past. Now that this first season is being released in a DVD box set, I am absolutely ecstatic an can't wait untill it gets to my doorstep to relive this exciting adventure once again! Thank you so much for allowing me to enjoy this wonderful show again and I look forward to a future release of seasons 2 and 3!",1163980800,6,1803,4.797427652733119
1788999,5,B00006RCLW,"This movie is like the a tv season of a show. I find it short but good. At the end of the video it keeps you wondering whats going to happen next.

It is like watching a boys dream coming true. He love for Black (the stallion). Never fails. He does anything in his power to keep him fit and ready for the next race. I find it a very heartwarming dvd to watch.",1141776000,3,359,3.8513513513513513
1789000,2,B00006RCLW,"I originally bought this DVD thinking that this was the movie starting with Alec Ramsay being saved by the Black.  As I watched it I realized that it was a TV show and a poorly done one as well.  The script is poorly written at best and it's almost a shame that Mickey Rooney accepted a contract.  There are a total of about 4 episodes plus a bonus that seemed to be a bonus only because I couldn't determine where it fell in the timeline.  Having read all of Walter Farley's books, I couldn't even tell which books the show was based off of.  The Black was played by a Friesan Stallion, not even an Arabian, and was referred to as a Thoroughbred.  Having been involved with horses almost all of my life, this was probably the most disturbing.  The cinemetography was poor and I probably will not ever watch it again.",1111795200,30,817,4.3355263157894735
1789001,5,B00006RCLW,"I loved this show when it was on the Family Channel and definitely enjoy the DVD.  Those who complain it is not the original ""Black Stallion"", all you have to do is look at the date of 1990 and KNOW it couldn't possibly be the original!!!!  JEEZ, give me a break!!!",1111017600,8,265,4.176470588235294
1789002,5,B00006RCLW,"I was a large fan of both this TV series and the movies. I think that most people if they like horses will enjoy this series. I always felt like I was with Alec on his adventures, it was not only Alec who could ride the Black, but I could ride him too.  I  do think they titled dvd wrong though. It is no wonder many people got confused and thought it was the 1979 movie. It should have simple been titled The adventures of the black stallion season 2 episodes 1 -5  , or they should have put Richard Ian Cox's name along side Mickey Rooney.",1109980800,12,541,4.037383177570093
7972617,5,B00006RCLW,"Outstanding movie of a young boy's love for the beautiful stallion that saved his life. Excellently acted and filled with poignant scenes that will melt your heart. Kelly Reno and Mickey Rooney work so well together to get ""The Black "" ready to run the race of a lifetime. You will fall in love with this movie.",1473465600,,311,4.473684210526316

7972622,4,B00006RCLW,"Love the characters - grumbly horse trainer Mickey Rooney (who was also the trainer in National Velvet with young Elizabeth Taylor), jocky Alex and of course the beautiful Black stallion. Whiat's interesting besides the main story lines, is the fact that the story physically moves from one beautiful location to another, giving glimpses into places like rural France and New Zealand.",1354406400,,384,5.311475409836065
7972623,5,B00006RCLW,This tale has it all.  The black stallion is ship wrecked with a young boy that learns to love him and ride him. But where did the horse come from and who actually owned him  Eventually these questions were answered but a tail so good!,1307404800,,235,4.2
7972624,3,B00006RCLW,"This was a nice series of shows, but when these came out I was hoping they would follow the books more. For instance, the series would start after the Black Stallion Returns. Mabe have shows about The Black's first son and go from there. Was disappointed they didn't do that, but it was still a decent.",1295913600,,302,4.410714285714286

7972626,1,B00006RCLW,"I was mislead by the title ""Black Stallion"" and the actor's name of Mickey Rooney who was in the movie. I bought it for my granddaughter and my son said it was not the Black Stallion movie at all but about the production of it or something. I never wld have bought it had I known that and that it was NOT the Black Stallion movie w/HOyt Axton, Mickey Rooney, etc which is true to the novel.",1227398400,2,390,4.077922077922078
