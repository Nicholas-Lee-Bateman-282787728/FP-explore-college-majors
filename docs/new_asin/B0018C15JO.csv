8269325,5,B0018C15JO,"I am a long time fan of Roger Mellott, a therapist and seminar speaker.  Sadly he passed away while
still quite young.

Mellott has unusual perspective on life that has helped me to improve my perspective.  Among other
techniques, Mellott uses clever analogies to communicate basic principles.  (One frequently used in this
program:  a person without perspective is like a fly on a TV screen - all they can see is one dot of color.
But, by moving back from the screen, one can see the actual picture.)

This particular program is the shortest of Mellott's programs (with only about 90 minutes, vs. 4 - 6 hours
on several of his other programs.  Its primary objective, as stated in the title, is to help us develop the ""courage""
to ""see clearly"".  Why?  Because we often intentionally avoid stepping back to see the whole picture... perhaps
because we don't want to confront the truth, including our own part in the problem.

Having listened to other Mellott programs again and again over 20+ years, I think of him as a good friend.

So, if you can find this program (it is out of print at this time), get it, listen to it, and embrace it.",1403913600,,1138,4.556650246305419
