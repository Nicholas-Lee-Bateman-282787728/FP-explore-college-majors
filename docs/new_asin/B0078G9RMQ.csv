8512310,5,B0078G9RMQ,A great way to work on your French and watch a great tale.  It is fun having your own little arthouse.,1356220800,2,102,3.857142857142857
8512311,4,B0078G9RMQ,"Acting is charming. The script, based on a novel by Belgian Andr&eacute; Stanislas Steemann --regarded as a master on crime or suspense stories-- is very good. Dialogues tend to be witty and sparkling and while this is a crime story, humor abounds to the point of being almost a murder-comedy.
Suzy Delair --at the time Clouzot's love-- is charming, as usual, in her role of the detective's girlfriend. Unexpected by him, the girlfriend follows the detective (who has gone undercover as a pastor) into the boardinghouse in question and in the end, for reasons not totally clear to me, she discovers the true identity of the serial killer --""M. Durand"" (where M stands for monsieur).
There is one other version of this book: a slightly more modern Argentine film called ""La Muerte Camina en la Lluvia"" (Death walks on the rain) by Carlos Hugo Christensen, where the murderer is called ""S. L&oacute;pez"". It is also considered quite good.
""Quai des Orfebres"" and ""Les Diaboliques"" are other two Clouzot suspense films deserving a view.",1354665600,4,1033,4.976878612716763
