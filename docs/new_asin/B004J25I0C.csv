8431519,4,B004J25I0C,"I bought this through Amazon.es (Spain).  If you like early cinema, if you like Georges Melies, you will certainly like Chomon.  His movies aren't quite as exuberant and funny as Melies, nor does he spin a story quite so coherently, and he tends to be overly repetitive at times; nevertheless, the films on this collection are engaging and at times astounding.  There are a LOT of coloured movies here; after a while you get spoiled and don't want to see one in black and white anymore!  His colouring process was different than Mme. Thuillier's hand-painting for Melies; apparently Chomon used stencil-painting, which I have yet to understand, given the constant movement of things in a film.  Many of the backdrops in these films collection are striking.  The ""Trip to Jupiter"" is probably the masterpiece on this DVD, and worth the price of the collection in itself.  It has much precision coloring, and has been nicely restored; except for some white speckling and inconsistent edges, the picture seems almost pristine.  (A real candidate for blu-ray treatment.)  It is also a very imaginative movie in every way: characters, story, colour, editing, and humour.  Not the ground-breaking ""A Trip to the Moon"", but fantastic in its own more limited way.

Some thoughtful restoration work seems to have been done on these films.  I never understood why the Melies films were not better restored but left with frames containing white flash-lines, black blots and various forms of crud, and other major blemishes (including Melies' own terrible splices).  Also the Melies films we now have are often poorly lighted, or without proper contrast, so the tacky backgrounds show up or the picture is greenish and washed out.  It is VERY EASY to hide most of these defects, but it does take some time.  The restorations done here could also be refined, but the movies appear to have been preserved unusually well (or there has been more restoration than I can see), so overall the images are pleasing to watch.  I mostly just wish the movies were presented in high-definition so I could make out facial details a little better (minus half a star).

The musical accompaniments for these films are all piano, and range from mediocre to effective.  Although the music to ""Une Excursio Incoherente"" was head-shakingly unimaginative, no soundtrack really annoyed me, and some of the music was actually composed with the changing action of the film in mind (no, a lot of silent-film music is NOT composed this way; sometimes I wonder if the composers are even watching the film they are writing for).  ""Jupiter"", ""Les Tulipes"" and ""Ah! La Barbe"" had particularly engaging, if simplistic accompaniments.  ""Electric Hotel"" was also a fine job of fitting music to action.  Although a lot more could be done with music to breath life into these films, I do not think you will have to ""mute"" your monitor to watch them.

By the way, this DVD is not ""Region-free"" and will not play in a Region-1 DVD or blu-ray player.  At least it doesn't in mine!  This is a ""Region 2"" dvd.  but do yourself a favor and buy a region-free Pioneer dvd player with an HDMI cable for $80.  It is so VERY handy to have two dvd players so you can load up a second dvd (and skip the beginning advertisements and warnings) while showing a first dvd to your friends.  And if one player is region free, you can see otherwise unavailable Melies movies from StudioCanal (France), Max Davidson and Thelma Todd and other rare movies from Edition Filmmuseum (Netherlands), and of course movies by Chomon that come from Spain.",1337299200,3,3576,4.848434925864909
