8425905,3,B004DR5CB8,"this dvd is basically just a clip show dvd with the Nitro Circus crew talking about then best things they've done and there are a few new clips but not like their previous dvds, its a good addition for a person getting into Nitro Circus but if you have the previous dvds you have everything here, so i could only recommend it for really big fans of the crew and to new comers but casual fans will probally want to pass on this release.",1347235200,,435,4.190476190476191
