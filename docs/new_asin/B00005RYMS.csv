7952758,4,B00005RYMS,"If you can find this DVD for a reasonable price (I see $50 used right now, which is a joke, at half that it'd be worth it), then get it. You'll definitely be happy.

It is a bit of a downside that most/all of the footage is transfers from VHS, and thus is not of the best quality, but there's just something about 1980s Playmates, which most of these are... Playboy seemed to do a better job back then of picking heart-stoppingly gorgeous women.

In recent years, sadly, about 80-90% of Playmates are cute but don't really floor you... I get the feeling that a woman is picking them, not a guy, as they're more 'pretty' than sexy (and yes, there is a difference).

Not so with most of the ladies on this DVD... I guess the best way to put it is, what's the difference between Jennifer Anniston and Angelina Jolie? One's pretty, one's sexy, and you know which is which.

I'll deduct a star for the VHS-quality-on-DVD video, but otherwise, very nice vid.

One other quibble: Some of the segments are a bit too short, and are stripped-down offerings from the original footage that appeared in other Playmate vids.

Playboy, its okay to showcase a Playmate for more than 5 minutes, especially if the extra footage is hot, which it was in most cases that I recall. In fact, some of the best scenes were the ones that got cut.",1195257600,,1320,4.433884297520661
7952759,3,B00005RYMS,This video has lots of old footage that is not up to the quality of newer shoots.  I recomend getting a video with recent shoots.,947376000,4,129,4.16
