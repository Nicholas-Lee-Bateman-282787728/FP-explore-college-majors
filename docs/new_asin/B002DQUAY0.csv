8365878,5,B002DQUAY0,The concert footage and sound is awesome! Albert did all the songs I love and his guitar work leaves me speechless. Hogans Heroes are a fab group.,1381363200,,146,4.444444444444445
8365879,4,B002DQUAY0,"Any Alebrt Lee fan will want this video. The video is pretty good but the audio, while the mix is fine, is just painful. Its very trebly and *so compressed* there are no dynamics at all. Its just loud all the time, non-stop.",1304899200,3,224,4.232558139534884
8365880,4,B002DQUAY0,"Almost two hours long, a great performance by Albert et al.  Maybe my favorite version of ""Country Boy"" that I own- and have quite a few.  But he takes it up a notch even higher for the finale of ""Tear it up"".  Great work on piano and mandolin too- what talent.  My only complaint is that the camera work is lame: good close-ups of Albert playing, but they obviously hadn't thought of filming the rest of the band...you need to see what they do to the drummer to understand (if you are in the drummer's family...sorry!).  But definitely worth the price...wish I had been there!",1284940800,3,577,4.457142857142857
