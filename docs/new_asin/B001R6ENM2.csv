8337509,5,B001R6ENM2,Jerry The King Lawler and Junk Yard Dog are two of the best in professional wrestling history. Both of them deserve their place in the WWE Hall of Fame.,1363651200,,152,4.275862068965517

8337511,5,B001R6ENM2,"For those who don't already know, the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" program is a program on WWE 24/7 On Demand channel that's a roundtable discussion featuring Dusty Rhodes, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Michael Hayes, and Mike Graham speaking on various subjects. Throughout each discussion, you'll hear various personal & behind the scenes stories of each individual mentioned along with rare video highlights & pictures to showcase the point being put across. On each disc, you'll get a set of bonus matches with most of them never released on DVD before & even rare ones never seen on national television either...with Jesse Ventura's commentry not removed from the matches.

The panel's discussion regarding Lawler mostly revolved around his ability to remain the top star in the Memphis territory, Andy Kaufman, being able to ""talk fans into the arena"", and his successful transition into being a color commentator. Junkyard Dog's discussion turned out to be one of the best ones on this entire set as you hear them heavily talk about him breaking down racial barrier in not only wrestling but sports period, what made him appeal to all audiences, with the highlight being the story behind the infamous ""blind JYD"" angle with the Freebirds that resulted in so much heat that Michael Hayes said it himself that, ""I've never felt my life more threatened than in that era.""

Matches Include:
Jerry Lawler & Jimmy Valant vs. Kerry Von Erich & Michael Hayes - Just an average tag team match between all four men with Lawler & Kerry doing more of the wrestling while Hayes & Valant were more of the entertainers.
""AWA All-Star Wrestling"" Jan. '89

Jerry Lawler vs. Owen Hart - This was back when Owen Hart was still ""The Rocket"" and he's out for revenge against Lawler for all of Lawler's comments towards his family & his attack on Bret back at the King Of The Ring that year.  This was back when Lawler was his ""comedic heel"" character as Owen Hart dominated this match & had Lawler beat various times until one mistake cost Owen the match.
""Wrestling Challenge"" July '93

Jerry Lawler vs. Roddy Piper - I'm not even going to try to summerize this match because it was just horrible...so horrible to the point where Jerry Lawler didn't want to talk about it on Roddy Piper's DVD.  They had no chemistry with each other & seemed like both had ""two left feet"" in the ring.
King Of The Ring '94

Jerry Lawler vs. Bret Hart - This match was pretty short & sweet as Bret was more concentrated on punishing Lawler than wrestling him but there was interference from Hakushi, who Bret wrestled earlier in the night (in a match on Bret's DVD), that led to Lawler getting the win.  This was more of a preview of their match next month.
""In Your House"" May '95

Jerry Lawler vs. Bret Hart - This was the rematch from the previous month's ""In Your House"" with the special stipulation that the loser must kiss the foot of the winner resulting in Lawler making sure his foot had an absolutely horrible smell so Bret would have the worst experience possible if he lost.  Bret was real aggressive from the start that came back to bite him giving Lawler control for a few moments before Bret got back control.  Hakushi makes another appearence leading to Bret getting his revenge and for Lawler, that wasn't the only thing that didn't taste good.
King Of The Ring '95

Jerry Lawler vs. Marty Garner - This was a short squash match for Lawler.
""Superstars"" June '96

Texas Tornado Match: Junkyard Dog & Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff - The rules for this Texas Tornado match is that all four men are allowed in the ring at the same time & JYD came out in the military chamoflague just like Slaughter.  As you expect with these type of rules, there wasn't a dull moment as all four men worked well together with various double team moments along with times where things just got completely out of control.
Nov. '84

Junkyard Dog vs. WWE Intercontinental Champion Greg Valentine - This was an average match between the two.
WrestleMania

Junkyard Dog vs. Randy Savage - Savage brought out more of a competitve match than you normally would see from JYD at this time in what turned out to be a good encounter.
The Wrestling Classic '85
(""Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 80's"")

Junkyard Dog vs. Adrian Adonis - This was a good match as they had their  entertaining moments as you would expect from the JYD while Adrian was just gold as his ""Adorable"" character and Jimmy Hart only added to everything.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Mar. '86

Junkyard Dog vs. Harley Race - This was more of a preview for their later WrestleMania match but it was definately entertaining.
""Saturday Night's Main Event"" Jan. '87

Junkyard Dog vs. Harley Race - The stipulation for this match was that the loser must bow to the winner.  This was pretty short & sweet but what happened afterwards was more memorable than the match itself.
WrestleMania III

This was one of the best disc in the collection as you had a very informative discussion along with bonus matches that were quality in their own special way (well...maybe not the Lawler/Garner match).  I recommend.",1234224000,4,5136,4.701226309921962
