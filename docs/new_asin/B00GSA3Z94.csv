8626737,1,B00GSA3Z94,"I don't exactly remember how I ever came to know of the mere existence of this so-called Christmas horror anthology but all I know is that all 3 vignettes plus the main story are completely unwatchable garbage from beginning to end.  Literally not one of them is good or even acceptable at all.

Getting down to the brass tacks allow me to rate each of the three vignettes plus the main story without giving away too much.

Vignette #1: The Lady Bruins Christmas Slumber Party:
There is nothing well thought out in this story.  First you meet some sexy women who are uppity high class snobs and for me not at all relatable plus one really lame girl of whom is the total polar opposite of all of them.  They party hard until some mysterious invaders all clothed in black see to invading the home to slaughter all of the sexy rich girls.

This movie showcased decidedly terrible camerawork that is not only badly framed but also doesn't show much background in any of the scenes and when it does, the background is very blurry.  The shaky cam is also very annoying as well.  The women are hot but uninteresting.  Their brief nude scenes are very enjoyable but that doesn't fix anything.  The occasional very poor ADR is just an embarrassment as the characters sometimes speak with an accent that wasn't there previously.  Finally the ending really sucks in that it makes no sense at all plus nothing is explained.  A solid 1/2 out of 5.

Vignette #2: Alexandria:
There is minimal to be said about this turkey of a story.  It moves painfully slow with horrible edits.  It also suffers from annoying shakycam, more terrible framing of the scenes, backgrounds that are both bland as they are barely in focus/blurry, completely flat characters, a boring premise that is almost impossible to get a handle on, and finally an ending that is not only incoherent but also highly violent and disturbing to no end.  Worst of all even the description of this vignette doesn't make it any easier to understand.

No nudity, flat characters, dull and plodding pacing/editing, no humor or camp, and the most disturbing and confusing ending ever.  A solid 1/4 of a star. Definitely the worst of the three all told.

Vignette #3:  The Crann Doll:
This one is the least eventful of all.  It deals with a couple and their baby having car trouble and when they stop a guy named Allen for help who turns out to be a complete d*****bag and to make matters worse he carelessly runs over their child.  Without giving away too much very little happens at this point other than some supposed curse and not alot else.  A solid 1/8 stars out of 5.

No nudity, no humor or camp, another story that makes no sense and goes absolutely nowhere with no conclusion to it, still more really bad camera framing, shakycam, better backgrounds but not by much, flat characters, it's just as forgettable as the first 2, finally it's just plain boring.

Outside of all the other flaws that each of these 3 colossal pos all have, there is also the issue with not one of the stories or the characters intertwining once.  The main story featuring 2 hot girls torturing some guy in the kitchen while telling him these 3 totally dreadful stories is not only a dull and disturbing part of the movie but none of the 3 stories have jack to do with the main story either.

In the end, this movie is a complete and utter trainwreck and waste of time.  Not one of the 3 vignettes nor the main story are worth seeing.  This whole movie was made embarrassingly amateurish from the camera work right down to the writing.  This is not worth it for the little bit of nudity at the beginning.  This whole movie is totally forgettable as it is worthless.  This whole movie is too disturbing and not at all scary.  As this movie is completely worthless garbage not meriting any semblance of talent in the writing, storytelling, acting, characterization, editing, lighting, camera work etc., this movie just plain isn't even worth watching just to kill time either.  A MUST SKIP!!!",1513728000,,4017,4.6112676056338024
