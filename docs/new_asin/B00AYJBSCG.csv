This particular one has 3 different videos, Favorite Sing Alongs, Favorite Childrens Stories, and Favorite Nursery Ryhmes.
These Baby Genius videos are really something different, very well made and innovated. They play nursery rhymes,and childrens stories with live skits with children,  really interesting and funny puppet,s and cartoon characters, all interacting during each song, rhymes, stories etc. They are updated how these teaching segments are shown, while still using the original words on each-No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed, Ring Around the Rosy, The Counting Song, the Alphabet song and many many more, This is easily the best learning and entertainment series I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. i would recommend this to anyone with children, and have.",1401926400,,1073,5.238372093023256
