Doctor Smythe is a golf, golf, golf, (God bless you), golf (try saying golf really fast)...well I think golf is in his blood.  If you put his blood under a mirco you will see little tiny golf balls floating in his blood.  Love you Dr Smythe.  But if you remember Carol Burnett Show and how Tim Conway made us laugh.  I liked the parts when they themselfes had to laugh at each other. I do not play golf but I would say ""calling ALL golfers, you have got to see this and laugh out loud.  Thank You. God Bless You.
