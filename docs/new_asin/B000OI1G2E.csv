2796199,5,B000OI1G2E,"New Tricks is a cold-case comedy/police procedural drama: a dramedy, if you will. The actors, the writing, and the directing are just superb - QUALITY. It doesn't take long before you'll be laughing out loud, but viewers still feel the serious nature of the crimes being solved. Each crime is a cold case, and each detective has his own strength and idiosyncracies - so we avoid boredom and predictability. Each crime is solved differently. Each episode is guaranteed to be simultaneously hilarious. I never miss this show on BBC America if I can get it - and I'm ordering Seasons 3-6 from Amazon-UK since the US is taking much too long to release them (I have a region-free DVD player compatible with US televisions). I highly recommend this sophisticated mystery series because of its ability to carry off serious police procedural with quality comedy.",1277078400,55,854,4.9375
2796200,5,B000OI1G2E,"This is absolutely the best thing on television - and not just for us viewers ""of a certain age.""  The profesionalism, the polish, the proper use of language - this is what adult entertainment should be.  Many times no words are necessary - just a shrug or nod or facial expression are enough to convey a response.  Young people today should use this series as a university course to learn the art of acting.  The DVDs aren't coming out quickly enough for me, but I treasure the two series I have and eagerly await more.",1276128000,38,520,4.442105263157894
2796201,5,B000OI1G2E,"This is truly a great BBC series..!!.....The stories revolve around a special investigative section of the British Police that investigate ""cold cases"" and cases no one else wants. The group is headed by a woman and 4 retired inspectors brought back from retirement to do these investigations. Funny, serious, quirky, and thoroughly entertaining in British humor sort of way. I have seen all of the first two seasons and am anxiously waiting for season 3.",1272585600,8,455,5.08

2796205,4,B000OI1G2E,"Interesting cases and characters. My only quarrel is with the sound quality, often a problem with British TV shows - the music is WAY TOO LOUD and the speech is far softer and of varying volume. Aside from this technical quibble, the series has been, so far, excellent.",1477094400,,269,4.625

2796211,5,B000OI1G2E,My wife and I have loved this show from the time we discovered it.  The portrayal of the relationships among the aging ex-cops and their younger female boss are always sensitive.

2796222,5,B000OI1G2E,Love the program; got addicted to it while visiting our daughter's family in London for the holidays. Glad we are able to get it back in the USA.

2796225,2,B000OI1G2E,"I've been binge watching British murder mysteries for about 6 months now as I recover from a recent illness. As I compare the older mysteries --anything by Agatha Christy, Morse, Inspector Lewis, Palfrey of Westminster and others written and produced before the mid 1990s to early 2000s -- I find I am less and less impressed. Something that was very important has been lost. I'm tempted to say it's along the lines of a sense of order and dignity in the main characters, a clear sense of right and wrong. The latter loss was definitely evident to me in the very last of the David Suchet Poiret series.

New Tricks falls more into the category of the former. It seems the producers were trying to blend levity of character and weight of subject matter but failed to create a winning amalgam of the two. Plainly speaking, I don't think the characters are worthy of our attention, and hence, over the course of the first episode that I watched, I became more and more distanced from the development of the plot. There is more to be said about this, but I realize I need to go back and watch episode one in order to be more specific. I will add additional commentary if I'm allowed to do so on this platform. I apologize in advance for any lack of real substance in my comments thus far.",1445558400,4,1284,4.463829787234043

2796227,1,B000OI1G2E,"Although we have always enjoyed this Program, this episode and perhaps season did not contain the quality of those episodes we have watched.

2796259,5,B000OI1G2E,"Love the use of older actors with their depth, wisdom and wit.  Was looking for a British detective series that isn't too gory, has accomplished actors, fun plots and humor always helps.  NEW TRICKS suits those requirements.  Like to treadmill to mysteries as the suspense and problem-solving in the cases they work on makes the time go by more quickly.  Glad to have found this series.  It helps to have scenery that isn't too familiar, so mysteries set in England are kind of a travelogue for us Anglophiles.",1405123200,2,510,4.75

2796262,5,B000OI1G2E,"The strength of this series lies in the writing. The story line travels between the case in question and the back stories of the Detectives involved. Over time we come to know each D.I. as a friend, with good points and faults. These are not two dimensional superheroes, but vulnerable humans who care for their fellow humans. The cases are explicated through quiet, thoughtful investigation, and reasoned deduction. The resolution is often not what one will expect. Those seeking guns, explosions, and T and A, and swift hard justice are advised to look elsewhere. In short, this series reflects real life, with its muddle, uncertainty, and imperfect resolution. All praise to the writers and actors of this fine show. Damn few like 'em.",1402012800,,738,5.008130081300813
2796263,5,B000OI1G2E,"I like Dennis Waterman and Alun Armstrong especially. As Dennis says he is a naughty boy, but not a bastard and Alun's quirkiness is just perfect for the part. I have watched the Sweeney, which is a 70's series with John Thaw and Dennis Waterman. Dennis was more serious in The Sweeney, but he played it wonderfully. And that guy could run even with the smoking. Ta",1399420800,,365,4.462686567164179

2796266,1,B000OI1G2E,"Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disappointment. The writing gave the actors little choice. The characters never achieved personhood and remained cut-outs.

2796272,5,B000OI1G2E,"The Brits know how to create exciting, meaningful, worthwhile, suspenseful--and even funny.  The cast ensemble of these early seasons works well and each episode seems original enough, so much so that I have no problem watching them. I look forward to more episodes. It is refreshing to see, especially in the UK, that Sandra is indeed cracking that Glass Ceiling, especially in police enforcement circles. It is also interesting how this group of ""policemen"" really is a diverse crowd, pesonality wise and they all have something substantial to offer.  All those ""old cases"" are now finally being solved.  Long live the series!",1387152000,,628,5.137254901960785
2796273,4,B000OI1G2E,"It was a well done performance, but I felt that some of the lewd references discolored the overall event.  It was very ""earthy"" and realistic, and I did appreciate that the main character owned up to her emotional excess.  It didn't appeal on all levels, which I believe is just a matter of my taste.  I chose to watch it because I like the actor who was in the ""Garrow's Law"" series.",1385942400,,384,4.305555555555555

2796277,5,B000OI1G2E,"I bought all the seasons, including the last one where one of the main actors leaves.  We will miss him but the new guy is fitting in well so I hope they will continue making these.  The characters are funny and touching at times, the older detectives way of doing things often clash with the new way and the home life of the characters makes it even more interesting. The cases are interesting, especially since they are cold cases for the most part.",1377907200,,451,4.421686746987952

2796280,5,B000OI1G2E,"New Tricks is one of the best series to be on TV today. The British know how to make good TV, and this show is one of them. A team of police detectives are brought out of retirement to help close unsolved cases. Modern methods just can't compete with the tricks and experience of these wise old guys.

There is plenty of fun and humour in the show, and drama and puzzles to make every episode exciting. Try one, you will buy them all.",1377043200,,434,4.166666666666667

The concept of old duffers being pulled out of retirement to tackle cold cases appealed to me as I am in early dufferhood my self.  When Amazon lowered the price I bit the bullet and bought the first two seasons on DVD.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Amazon Video on Demand has all the remaining seasons in their archives and I have been streaming them through my Vizio Blu-Ray player.  Looking forward to seeing all seasons.

And I must not forget Dennis Waterman as Gerry Standing who sings the theme song and has too many exwives.  And we have Esther who is Brians TV wife and who does her best to keep Brian quasi normal.  In real life she is james Bolam's wife. Enjoy the first eight seasons because series nine will disappoint in part due to the ego of a writer-director named Julian Simpson.",1367280000,,746,4.7

Story lines are fresh, considering how many police dramas are available, and the treatment of the subject of aging while remaining viable to society is a welcome addition to the story line.

The mysteries are good, but it it the interaction and actions of the three retired policemen brought back to solve unsolved crimes that is like the three stooges.  Jack has conversations with his dead wife enshrined in his back yard, Gerry, the lad, with many ex-wives has an eye for the women, and Brian the near bipolar with a total recall memory. Sandra, the chief inspector, tries to rein in this zany bunch.  They solve crimes in many unorthodox ways, which they can get away with as they are not really cops. The acting is supurb.  They can do as much with a glance as with a paragraph of script. WE order these as fast as they are available.  Series Six will be available in January.  May may not have noticed that Jerry Waterman also sings the theme song as he did in previous series that he starred in.  This is not a mystery series in the vain of Midsommer Murders or Frost or Lewis, but for pure entertainment it is one of the best.",1322265600,,963,4.351955307262569

2796326,5,B000OI1G2E,"If you haven't seen the two earlier seasons of New Tricks (Season One and Season Two), grab those first - and check out my reviews of both of those volumes. They are wonderful. Now, if you are reading this review and you have seen the previous volumes, I don't need to give you the plot or tell you how engaging the characters are. You know - or you wouldn't have come this far. I was hooked on the series from the pilot episode on the Series One set and, like peanuts, I just can get enough of the adventure of the team of retired police officers and their somewhat younger female boss. These folks are like old friends now and yet the scriptwriters reveal new layers and facts about their lives as the episodes evolve. In this season you'll learn how Jack's wife, Mary, died. And a bit more about Brian's ""past problems"". The stories range from some pretty gruesome murders to a turf war between competing ice cream trucks.

It's my understanding that series is still going in England but the DVD versions are coming out slower in the US. Thanks to Acorn Media Group, this Season Three was released in February, shortly after I finished watching Season Two. (and - mark your calendars! - Season Four is coming - I'm told - in June!).

This is the first volume to include anything that seriously can be considered a ""Bonus"". It's a 20-minute ""Behind The Scenes"" featurette. Sadly, its really a lot of scenes repeated from Season Three mixed with interviews with three or four of the GUEST actors. Not one comment from any of the UCON team! And even the print quality of the scenes shown is distorted. But I'm not deducting any stars. Just alerting readers that its not much.

One other thing occurs in Season Three that did not occur in the prior two. In fact, it is only in the last episode of this season. The show's producers have gone the way of American TV soap operas. They inserted a ""cliffhanger"" at the end. I won't give it away - I certainly don't want to decrease the enjoyment of watching the series - but now I have to wait at least three months to see what happens. Until now, each episode stood on its own and could be watched in any sequence. Oh well, I can't have everything!

This is still one of the smartest character driven shows I've seen and I just cant wait till I get to see more!

2796327,4,B000OI1G2E,"New Tricks is one of the most enjoyable series to come from the prolific guys at the BBC. This set is no dissappointment, the ""Old Dogs"" deleiver and serve up mirth and mystery enough for any fan and for the fans to be they'll make you run right out and order the other two discs. Do yourself a favor and order them from some reliable vendor and not Amazon. The discs I got in Set Three were fine until I reached disc three. It was flawed or damaged in some way and would not play. Internet return proceedures are so complex and draconian that it would be more trouble to return it than to eat it. I was going to order Set Three of Dalziel and Pascoe, but now I think I'll find another vendor. Buy the set, the show is wonderful. You will enjoy every actor and script. James Bolam and Amanda Redman are wonderful and Dennis Waterman is brilliant as the incoragable Gerry. New Tricks, new fun and will make ""gettin' to the end of the day"" a joy.",1299369600,,944,4.220994475138122

Great acting, all the actors not only can act, they have timing so that the humor is truly humorous - you don't need a laugh track to tip you off that something was said that is supposed to be funny. The writing is exceptional - I hate that so many U.S. shows (and now more and more U.K. programs corrupted by us) have simply godawful writing - hoping that talented actors can pull something out of a hat - you need both good writing and acting and if you want both, see each and every episode of New Tricks. Unreserved positive reviews for all seasons. Both my husband and I love them and never miss an episode on PBS.",1299369600,3,679,4.190839694656488
2796329,5,B000OI1G2E,"This release of Season three (3) of ""New Tricks"" has been eagerly anticipated by me because I loved Seasons 1 and 2 of the series.  I can now add Season three (3) to my admiration list.  I love Season three (3) for it continues what I loved in the preceding seasons.  That being a very well written and acted  series about some retired older cops returning to a ""cold case"" unit to solve some heinous unsolved cases in often very amusing ways mainly because the old returning cops have ""Issues"" that their leader (fabulously played by Amanda Redman of ""Little Dorit"") must deal with.

Season three features eight (8) episodes on three (3) discs running about 2 hrs each and it is so very good.  I can hardly wait for future releases of this series because it is such a very good British murder/mystery/detective series that is certainly different in wonderful ways from others in this genre--it features older cops solving crimes often in very amusing ways. I love it.

By the way, the third episode entitled ""Old Dogs"" is simply wonderful.  That episode is filled with humour and involves a serial killer that kills  certain kinds of dogs not humans as thought intially but our team finds out, after awhile that humans are his/her victims too including one of their own that narrowly escapes death.

(Again I used the subtitles and I am so very glad that I did because the scrips are so well written with loads of very funny lines)",1298592000,5,1432,4.624505928853755

2796331,5,B000OI1G2E,"Season 3 makes you laugh all the way through each unsolved reopen crime. This quirky team is lead by foxy DCSandra Pullman (Amanda Redman -`At Home with the Braithwaithes' 'Little Dorrit `) who runs OCOS (Unsolved Crime & Open Case Squad) from the basement due to a bad situation of her past. OCOS could also stand for ""Unsolved Crime's Outrageous Squad"". She recruits 3 ex-cops from retirement. Pullman is blond, aggressive, a good-looker, likes cheap wine, with a wild private life, and bound to get the job done, one way or another. The 4 combine to solve the cold cases, but in such a funny way. This BBC Crime/Comedy show is still in production as of 2011. Will it last as long as Midsomer Murders, also yet continuing? It is just as good. Really funny.

The other quirky cops:
Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong-' Garrow's Law', 'Little Dorrit' 'Braveheart `) on meds, a great memory, biker, funniest cop, and married to Esther (Susan Jameson- 'When the Boat Comes In' & reader for many Catherine Cookson audio novels).
Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman-`The Sweeney' 'Stay Lucky `) is a womanizer divorced 3 times, is this a problem? Yes
Jack Halford (James Bolam-`Beiderbecke' 'Born & Bred' 'End of the Affair `) lost his wife and now talks to her regularly at the memorial in his back yard. She yet brings him comfort and investigative success. He sometimes looks like and acts funny like Bob Hope.
Each episode has guest stars, too many to catch them all.

Subtitles, YES. Also 20 min behind the scenes, & filmographies.
The theme song; ""It's all right, it's OK, doesn't really matter if you're old & grey. . ."" and then the comedy crime investigation begins.

And it is because each one brings something different to the table that their success rate is so high.  Having a younger woman having to keep them all moving in a general direction adds to the overall positive chemistry of the show.  The story lines are different and entertaining.
