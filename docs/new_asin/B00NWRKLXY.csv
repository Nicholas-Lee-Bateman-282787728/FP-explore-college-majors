6684012,5,B00NWRKLXY,"Dudley and Kitty are back for another hilarious and action-packed season of TUFF Puppy! The crime-fighting team are at it again fighting the likes of DOOM, The Chameleon, Bird Brain, The Caped Cod, and FLOPP from taking over Petropolis! Like Invader Zim and Danny Phantom before it, TUFF Puppy has become a cult classic by many and that thanks to Butch Hartman (Fairly OddParents, Danny Phantom) who given the show (as I mentioned with season 1) a lot of action, a lot of comedy, and a lot of heart. The Season 2 DVD contains all 26 episodes in production order and presented in their original widescreen formats (something that several episodes in Season 1 that were made during Season 2 like A Doomed Christmas lacked). So if love Nicktoons and/or a fan of Butch Hartman's work, then TUFF Puppy is right up your alley!",1421539200,3,820,4.701388888888889

8680845,5,B00NWRKLXY,"I'm about near the end [:-(] of this HILARIOUS, BEST-DESIGNED AND FUNNY cartoon series! Strangely, with this SECOND season set, the sound is 'MONO', not STEREO like Season 1 is. [???] Anyway it doesn't take away from over-all fun, hilarious, face-paced [argh!][:-)] that this show has already proved to be. I already wrote a review about TUFF Puppy Season 1 and so did a lot of other people! So....[!][:-)]",1473724800,,406,4.898550724637682

8680849,5,B00NWRKLXY,"T.U.F.F. is a fun and lovable cartoon, with many interesting and funny characters. From the goofy protagonist Dudley Puppy and his karate-trained partner Kitty Katswell, to the hilariously stupid villain Verminious Snaptrap, this show has an amazing cast of great characters. For anyone who is familiar with Butch Hartman's previous cartoons, such as The Fairly Odd Parents and Danny Phantom, or for viewers who like cartoons with Looney Tunes-style humor and animation, this is the perfect show for them!",1422921600,,505,5.405063291139241
