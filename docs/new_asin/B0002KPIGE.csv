I have been satisfied with all his teaching DVDs and method books.",1517270400,,151,4.428571428571429
8028368,4,B0002KPIGE,"I had trouble opening the PDF as well.  I contacted Stphen Grossman's Guitar Workshop (the distributer), and Mr. Grossman's replied!  He told me how to open the TAB on  a PC and explained it is easier on a Mac.  So, the previous reviewer iis not quite correct, but it is a challenge to open the TAB.  That should be explained.  Woody Mann does a great job.  His playing is so smooth.  The instruction is clear, bu Blind Blake is a challenge.  I wish Woody played and sang the entire song.  It would have been helpful.",1454716800,,517,4.347368421052631
8028369,1,B0002KPIGE,"The PDF file did not open/nothing appeared for it when I put the DVD into my computer. All that came up was the menu to watch the DVD. there was no booklet for the tabs and the disc was dirty and had weird spots on it. I thought the DVD would actually help teach the songs, but Woody Mann just talks about what techniques Blind Blake uses in some of his songs. That's it. I didn't learn how to play the songs. It's basically good to just listen to.",1411344000,,448,4.044943820224719
8028370,5,B0002KPIGE,"Woody Man not only is a incredable guitar player, but in my humble opinion one of the best guitar teachers out there, i've extracted more great info from his teaching then all the other teaching dvds i have collected which is cosiderable.",1358208000,,238,4.690476190476191
8028371,5,B0002KPIGE,"Woody Mann is a man who knows his business of blues guitar thoroughly. Blind Blake is easily the toughest/most skilful blues player ever seen, so you really need some good instruction to get inside to the secrets of Mr Blake.
Woody Mann is very good teacher. In fact, I'm actually trying to avoid other teachers and buying only his videos and other teaching material, because he is so good at it. Check out his Art of Acoustic Blues Guitar-series if you are beginner. This video is for intermediate and advanced players.",1266969600,5,520,4.725274725274725
8028372,5,B0002KPIGE,"This may be Woody Mann's best DVD lesson!

This DVD builds in simplicity and goes carefully step by step, culminating in the one long wonderful rag, full of fabulous licks that the student has been slowly exposed to overtime.

This is the perfect companion DVD to Woody Mann's ""Guitar of Big Bill Broomzy"" which has many similar licks.

It is not hard to learn, but takes a great deal of practice to master.

Within this one DVD, a student may fine 6 months of private lessons from a gifted master teacher.

Many talented musicians offer DVD lessons, but not all are gifted teachers.  A teacher who possesses the gift of teaching can anticipate where students may struggle, and will revisit the issue at hand repeatedly.  Woody Mann is a terrific performer, but is a gifted teacher.  It has the ""line up on line, precept upon precept"" feel that is so necessary for successful teaching.

It may be wise to start with ""Big Bill Broomzy"" DVD (here at Amazon) but even as a stand alone, this may be his finest. (the jury is still out in our home because we have just received two more of his DVDs and will review them in time)  As it stands now, I purchase everything I can taught by him.  This is his clearest and most concise and theme building DVD yet.  A marvel for anyone who loves fingerstyle guitar.",1258761600,6,1302,4.493617021276596
8028373,4,B0002KPIGE,Not for beginners.  Blake requires technique and Mann moves fast through the pieces.  But if you're an intermediate+ player this will get you into some great tuneage.,1189209600,8,166,5.111111111111111
