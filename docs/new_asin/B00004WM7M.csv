1366453,2,B00004WM7M,"An impressive cast and a well-made trailer for this movie caught my eye, but I found the film a bit disappointing.  While the cast list is promising, the vast majority of the film centers around Sammo Hung's  character, with most of his fellow students (and the students of his  teacher's rival) only putting in a few sparse fight scenes.  I was looking  forward to some graceful moves reflecting real skill on the screen, and  while this wasn't entirely absent from the film, most of the fights center  instead around glowing red palms that punch through wood and fists that  make that classical wind-whooshing sound (grin).
The plot is propelled  by typical fare for the period:  cheesy comedy and paper-thin schemes.  Not  a complaint on my part...most fans of this genre are familiar with (and  hopefully inured to) these shortcomings.  All in all, I would hesitate to  recommend this film.  Unless some names in the cast evoke *strong*  nostalgia, there isn't too much here to make this a good addition to most  fans' collections.",948844800,2,1035,4.884393063583815

1366458,5,B00004WM7M,"The Magnificent Butcher is one of the best kung-fu movies ever made. The calligraphy fight scene alone makes the movie worth watching. Sammo Hung Kam-Bo plays Butcher Wing, a student of the legendary Chinese folk hero Wong Fei-Hong, and gets tangled up in a web of lies.

1366475,4,B00004WM7M,"After the major success of Snake in Eagle's Shadow (1978) and Drunken Master (1978), both directed by Yuen Wo-Ping, the comedic template that fueled these films would be remade over-and-over again with the sifu/student relationship in the forefront (often starring Yu Jim Yuen students like Cliff Lok in Choi Lee Fat Kung Fu) and often employing an elderly beggar who is adept at drunken kung fu (the art of Zui Quan).  Golden Harvest's Magnificent Butcher (1979: Chinese title is Lam Sai Wing) follows this pattern with Yuen Wo-Ping as the director and co-action director with leading man Sammo Hung as the student Lam Sai Wing, the venerable Kwan Tak-Hing in his most famous role as sifu Wong Fei Hung and Fan Mei-Sheng (Postman Strikes Back (1982)) in the Beggar So type role.  In fact, the biggest negative attribute about this movie is it is a byproduct of not only the sifu/student/beggar films, but it incorporates many elements from Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan films of that era -- which I will detail later.

Sammo Hung is the perfect actor for Lam Sai ""Butcher"" Wing -- a real-life portly (not as rotund as Sammo though) butcher by trade and student of the legendary Wong Fei Hung -- because of his physical adroitness and personal affability.  I might have problems with the plot, but not with Sammo Hung's performance.  Butcher Wing, as portrayed in this film, is a student who gets in trouble and shames his master (analogous to Jackie Chan in Drunken Master).  He happened to overly, excessively and somewhat unintentionally beat up an elderly man (Fung Ging-Man) who had just stole a Chinese chess piece in a rage for losing the game.  The chess player goes to Master Kao (Lee Hoi-Sang, Warriors Two (1978), The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978)) to get even against Wing (though who could blame him) by making up lies about Wong Fei Hong and Butcher Wing.

Master Tao confronts Wong Fei Hung about his student's (erroneous) lack of respect for Tao and his school and engages in one of the highlights of the film -- a calligraphy duel.  Without spoiling the scene by explaining it, it is quite exquisite in its use of a very flexible Kwan Tak-Hing (good to see him stay in shape in his later years) even though he is doubled for the more difficult actions.  Needless to say who won, but later Wing gets the full wrath of Hung by being disciplined to do a tortuous horse stance (much like in Drunken Master).

Meanwhile, chubby Lam Sai Kwong (Chiang Kam, Drunken Master (1978), Choi Lee Fat Kung Fu (1979)) is looking for his ""skinny"" brother (using a real old picture of Sammo Hung), but gets tricked into losing his wife May to a lecherous Tai Hoi (Fung Hak-On in a role similar to his one in Iron Fisted Monk (1977) just not as nasty).  Concurrently, a beggar (Fan Mei-Sheng is also doubled a lot; sometimes it looks like Sammo Hung) with great drunken boxing skills comes to town stealing inebriated chickens and barely prevents the attempted suicide of Sai Kwong.  Sai Kwong gets the beggar on his side and he goes off to confront Tai Ho.  Tai Ho being much more brilliant than the beggar and Lam Sai Kwong gets those two to fight each other -- in that fight you will see a Popeye gag that was used before in Half a Loaf of Kung Fu (1978).

Eventually the good get together against the bad (Tai Hoi and 5 Dragons School) though Master Kao is treated as bad, but he really is not, it is just his hubris and tragic belief in his son that leads him to the wrong path.  However, the biggest positives of this film are certainly not the storyline.  The action scenes directed by Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo-Ping are excellent.  Lam Ching Ying starting with a fan and ending with elbow knives has an excellent battle with Yuen Biao.  Also during this same scene, Yuen Miu with his mad monkey kung fu skills has an excellent fight with Wai Pak.  Also there is a great finale with Lee Hoi-Sang versus Sammo Hung.  Hung does an excellent flip move (not doubled during that move) during this melee that has to be seen.  Sammo was in top physical form during this era and the amount of martial art must have movies from this period he is in is extraordinary.  Plus the use of Kwan Tak-Hing is quite commendable and works perfect for this film.  This was originally the first time I saw him perform and was later made aware of his awesome reputation in earlier Cantonese Hong Kong films (now when will we see these Wong Fei Hung films come to DVD?).

For me there are enough negatives to keep this from being a classic martial art film.  Too much of the film is derived from other martial art films (even more than I mentioned above in the previous paragraphs, including a Knockabout (1979) reference ala what happens to Sai Kwong) and the script has too much of the Wong Jing (co-writer with Edward Tang) touch with the uneasy mix of violence and slapstick comedy not melding well (though I did like certain gags like the pig trotters one).  But for fans of Kung Fu action, much will be forgiven or ignored with the excellent martial art scenes taking precedence as the main impetus to watch and own this movie.  I like this film, I just do not love it.  However, there are many scenes I do not mind watching over and over again.

I have the R1 Fortune Star/Fox release which has a good transfer but mediocre extras including trailers, photo gallery, quick biographies, production notes and ""amazing"" Sammo Hung music video. The big minuses are the dubtitles and no original mono.  Here is another example of a Hong Kong R1 release that does not match the Hong Kong Legends R2 release for extras including a Bey Logan commentary (unless you do not like him).",1214870400,,5657,4.576808721506442
1366476,4,B00004WM7M,"Though this movie is considered a classic, I had seen the first few minutes of it about a decade ago, and really wasn't interested.  There are a few of the so-called classics that I never really cared for:  ""Drunken Master"" comes to mind.  Don't hate it, it just does nothing for me.  Knowing that this movie was made by the same director (Yuen Woo Ping) that made ""DM"", I figured that it didn't deserve a 2nd chance.  Knowing also that it starred Sammo Hung, who was famous for kung fu comedies, strengthened my assertion that I was right.  After watching and enjoying Sammo's ""Prodigal Son"" and (to a lesser extent) ""Warriors Two"", I decided to give ""Magnificent Butcher"" a serious try.  It also helped that I had seen and loved Woo Ping's ""The Buddhist Fist"", from around the same time period.  I applied the ""grain o' salt"" method and finally watched it.  All I can say is ""Holy Crap!""  Why did I waste so much time not loving this movie?!?

Sammo plays Lam Sai Wing, one of the more famous students of Chinese healer, pugilist, and hero, Wong Fei Hung.  It's very difficult to get into the story (though it is easy to follow) without giving anything away.  So I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout that.  What I will tell you is that the fights and styles represented here are crazy, cool, and a whole lotta fun.  Wild Cat was my personal favorite, though it's not too easy on the ears.  For every one thing in this film that annoyed me, there were about 50 other things that I absolutely loved.  Most interesting is the casting of veteran actor and White Crane master Kwan Tak Hing as Wong Fei Hung.  Known for his many portrayals of Master Wong (he holds the record for one actor playing the same role ALL-TIME, in around 70 films), he still shows his chops with a calligraphy brush at just under the age of 75!  The entire cast is recognizable to old-schoolers and many of the actors deliver some ""best-ever"" moments.

20th Century Fox gives us a well-remastered picture and an audio option of an English or Cantonese soundtrack with, or without, subtitles.  Some silly bonus features are also included, but likely won't excite fans.  Goofy as this movie is, it has moments of deadly seriousness.  Some things would be better left hinted at and not shown, but I have seen worse and it's a minor complaint.  I don't have an official top-ten (my list is in no particular order), but if I did, ""Magnificent Butcher"" would certainly be included.  4.5 out of 5 and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

1366480,4,B00004WM7M,"The title of my review says it all. I personally bought the DVD because I'm a Jackie Chan/ Sammo Hung fan. Their style of fighting is conducive to the big screen. If they aren't kicking someone's ass with brilliant moves, they are falling on their asses in humorous situations. It's entertaining if you can appreciate slap stick humor. For people like that, I rate this movie a 5, but most people are watching these movies for amazing martial arts, and this movie doesn't really consistently give you that. There are two fights that are really very good, and one that is absolutely amazing. You should buy this movie just to see the fight that comes in the middle of it. I won't explain any further, I'll let you enjoy it for yourself. It's a pleasant suprise at the time that it comes.",1141689600,,786,4.542253521126761
1366481,2,B00004WM7M,"The fight scenes are bad; I'd always seen Sammo in his older-fatter days opposite Jackie Chan and thought: maybe he was better younger?

He wasn't.

There are only two things to recommend this movie (hence the two stars) --

1) The 'fight' between masters early on is wonderful, very different from just about anything else I've seen in 30 years of ""bad karate movie"" watching; and

2) The harm-to-innocents that occurs is.. surprising. Different enough to make you wish the entire movie'd been better to justify the thought that went into that bit of storyline.

However, it's too much crud to sit through just to enjoy those two bits of pleasant surprise. Rent it if you must but you'll be sooorrrryyyy...",1139529600,,707,4.809917355371901
1366482,5,B00004WM7M,"Wow!  You will find yourself thinking this quite often as you watch this great movie.  I bought this without having seen it before based on some of these reviews and seeing it on some listmania lists as a great kung fu film.  This was also the first Sammo Hung movie I had ever seen.  I could not be more satisfied.  I admit I was a bit skeptical, but after the first half hour I was thinking of how I had really scored with this one.

First off, Sammo Hung blew me away!  I had no idea how quick, agile, and fast he was.  His kung fu is flawless.  Well, Yuen Woo-Ping doing the choreography certainly helps.  Sammo does around six different styles himself and the other actors throw in about six more.  Some unique ones are monkey pole and wild cat styles.  There are plenty of fight scenes to keep the pace of the film high and always moving (probably one every ten minutes, sometimes even sooner).  This movie also has good comedy for an old kung fu flick, not just silliness.  The story of the movie is basic but still good.  It is about how butcher Wing(Sammo Hung) gets into trouble when his master, Wong Fei Hung, is away and he must deal with it on his own.  He is framed for a crime and must prove his innocence while trying to constantly defend himself from attempts on his life.

Well, the movie has no flaws so how about the DVD itself you ask.  It's perfect.  This is an extremely good digital transfer of the film.  I am speaking of the Fox/Fortune Star version.  I do not know about the HK version.  The sound is excellent, Dolby 5.1 with no background noise at all(the english dubbed version that is).  The voices for the dubbing are still the old original ones but they have a high sound quality.  And contrary to another reviewer's statement, the picture IS in anamorphic widescreen(enhanced).  Maybe they were referring to the original chinese DVD.  Nearly all of Fox/Fortune Star DVDs are in anamorphic widescreen.  Some other Fortune Star recommendations are Jackie Chan's The Young Master, The Prodigal Son or Knockabout both starring Yuen Biao, In The Line Of Duty 4 starring Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan, and The Duel to the Death.

Either there is a problem with the process they use to make this particular DVD or the CD's they're using are flawed.

1366499,4,B00004WM7M,"Sammo Hung in ""Lin shi rong"" is one of Sammo's most entertaining Films;(Directed by Woo-ping Yuen,Director of ""Tai-Chi 2"",""Twin Warriors"",""Iron Monkey"",""Dreadnaught"",""The Buddhist Fist"",e.t.c). The action hardly gives up,and most of the fighing appears to be well choreographed. Sammo blends his usual agile skill,and speed,with some genuinely funny comedy moments. I think this Film works well,and rates higher among the usual mediocre kung fu Films in the Eighties,for these reasons; it blends the small amount of comedy very well,into a more serious story,with better than average acting. You will find the scene involving a paintbrush(!)fight between the two School Masters an example of these things. This is one of times when you'll reach for the remote,not to fast forward to look for the next good fight;but to rewind! EYES:Correctly framed in the 2.35:1 Scope Ratio,the picture suprised me,i didn't think it could be as sharp as it was,and this is maintained,throughout. Only the occasional dot or speckle of dirt was apparent. I noticed 1 scratch,it lasted about 3 seconds! Overall,an excellent Job has been done. Not Enhanced for 16X9 Televisions. EARS:Great,for once,virtually no hiss,distortion,or background noise. And i did not have to turn up the volume to hear the speech,and down again when there was a fight! The English Subtitles are not very well done! They are not bad,but some words are missing a letter,and some sentences are incomplete,this is not a common occurence,and did not spoil my enjoyment.

Snake style, monkey style, drunken style, and even ""cat"" style are featured, including several weapon sequences.  Sammo Hung, while light-hearted, is rather serious in this one and in top form.

Secondly, Even though there is a bit of China-style  slapstick, Lam Sai Wing isn't pictured as the bumbling fool that most other  Wong Fei Hung movies depict him as these days. According to history, Lam  was Wong's best student. This movie doesn't try to defy that. Third, the  Kung Fu is wireless and fluid. Reason number four is the appearance of Kwan  Tak Hing. He is truly the best at doing Wong Fei Hung and it shows,  especially in the calligraphy duel scene. Last but not least, some  traditional Hung gar is displayed, and I like to see the style in a Kung Fu  flick kept true. Oh, and there is a bit of humor and Sammo looks as agile  as a cat.",965088000,6,743,4.212765957446808
1366502,3,B00004WM7M,"I bought this movie because I like to watch the mind boggling acrobatic martial arts work done by Yuen Biao, and his photo is very prominent on the cover of the movie. However, Biao has a fairly minor role in this film with  one excellent fight sequence towards the middle while he is defending  Master Wong's school with Wei Pei. ""Magnificent Butcher"" is  directed by Yuen Woo Ping, who helped Keanu Reeves with the martial arts  scenes in ""Matrix"". Woo Ping also directed the popular Jackie  Chan film ""Drunken Master"". ""Magnificent Butcher""  features excellent martial arts moves, and although Samo is not the  slimmest guy around, he is amazingly fast and agile. The odd movie title  comes from the fact that Samo's character is pork vendor ""Butcher  Wing"". The movie is billed as a comedy and it does have many lighter  moments, but theses are mixed in with an attempted rape, a woman being  suffocated, and a fatal stabbing. Actor Kwan Tak-Hing is always elegant and  interesting to watch as Wong Fei- Hung. Lam Ching Ying has a cameo role.  The slimy, bad guy is played to perfection by Fong Hak-On, who has played a  villian in several Jackie Chan Movies including ""Police Story"".  Samo portrays a martial arts student learning under the tutelage of Master  Wong, while master is away Samo is framed for the murder of the goddaughter  of the opposing school's teacher. A liquor swilling hobo tutors samo in  various new martial arts forms and prepares him to defend his name and  honor. If you like watching martial arts, this movie has many extended  fight sequences. Myriad classic martial arts weapons are used including  paintbrushes, fans, swords, and staffs. I liked the ""cat"" style  of kung fu shown, but there are several other excellent matches throughout.  This movie seems to extend into a second movie filmed almost at the same  time ""Dreadnaught"" was also directed by Yuen Woo Ping, has the  same martial arts school setting, uses Kwan Tak-Hing again as Master Wong,  and Fong Hak-On as the villian. Yuen Biao takes the lead role in this  movie.

The son of the main villain, a sneaky entitled sociopath, is actually better looking.  The martial arts are more like a dance than actual fighting.  The grunts and groans and smacks (popeyed cartoon style) can be too much, but you can turn the sound off and watch the 'dance' of the karate movements.  I sort of liked doing that.  The main guy, the hero (the Butcher), if he didn't use a stunt double--and I don't think he did--does have some cool moves.  I loved his 'mentor'--an old dude who is a total alcoholic but can move fast and hit without thinking, placing the blows where they should be placed since he has been doing them for so long and they are ingrained in him.  The women were wimpy--a la Simon Legree  style helpless females.  The story line is predictable, but I liked this movie.  The actors gave their characters some character, if you know what I mean.  It is a comedy because the 'fighting' is so hilarious--but these actors have to know what they are doing to have synchronized these scenes so well.  People die.  That isn't funny, but it is sort of like in the old westerns of the 1950's where people die and everybody, including the audience, just goes on with life.  There are typical male jokes in this flick--farts, urinating, that sort of thing--you can tell that men wrote the script and that men would laugh at those places. Their  9 year old boy coming out in them. No untoward sexual scenes however.  You root for the hero an boo the villain.  I watched it all the way through and felt good afterward.  If a movie can do that then it has merit.",1489708800,,1947,4.502857142857143

Don't expect a deep plot, this is fun and has so many ""styles"" of Kung Fu illustrated in the numerous fights.  And, yes, there are many, many fights.",1488240000,,311,4.811320754716981

7925722,3,B00004WM7M,"Sammo Hung does a good job with an Eastern perspective that may be a bit hard for Western minds to fully comprehend.  It is a bit more slapstick than the average China classic martial arts and has a few story gaffs (English translation problem maybe) but is a good ""no brainer"" entertainment.",1485475200,,292,4.615384615384615

7925725,4,B00004WM7M,"Another one of the Wong Fei Hung movie series, except Wong Fei Hung plays only a small part in this story.  He is the kung-fu master of his school, but one of the students played by Sammo Hung is always getting himself into trouble, especially with the other competitive kung-fu school.  The other school's son is a bad guy as he raped even his own god sister, but what upsets Sammo's character the most is that the son kills Sammo's character's younger brother.  One misunderstanding/lies leads to another until they finally fight.

Dubbed in English with subtitles if closed caption is turned on.  Excellent choreographed kung-fu.  Wong Fei Hung is a real historical legend who has excellent kung-fu and medicinal skills.",1484179200,,723,4.933884297520661
