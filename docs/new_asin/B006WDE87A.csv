8505558,5,B006WDE87A,"The newest release (out in 2012) is not disappointing.  Year in the Day features a song for every season -- or holiday.  Fourth of July Fireworks, green clovers, pumpkin pies, and even werewolves are shown in innocent and delightful situations, complete with the cast of the other DVD's (Gustafer, his friends, and various creatures from Earth and above!)

While I have only gone through the DVD 12 times or so (we seem to always have one of the DVD's playing on ""infinity play"" since our newest addition was born), I already have my favorite songs picked out from the playlist.  ""Pancake Smackdown"" is a hilarious ode to Fat Tuesday, and pairs a surreal pancake fight with floating melodies.  ""Pumpkin Pie"" is rhythmic and nostalgic, giving you an immediate need to relive the joys of whipped cream and nutmeg.  ""Fa La La"" honors the heart and soul of the Christmas season by inviting friends and family to ""come as they are"".  It is touching and real.

Kids who are used to fast-paced, high-tech romps in TV and video make be taken aback at the truly intentional use of animation and lyrics in these DVDs.  It's slower, creative, and wastes no word or sketch in telling the stories.  We have music going on 100% of the time at our house.  When we don't have praise and worship music going, we keep one of the Gustafer playlists going.  It mesmerizes the little ones and soothes the soul.

Like bonus features? This particular DVD has a rather long (but super-educational) bonus of watching Morgan create his masterpieces! Kids can see the process of animation - something that inspired my kids to start up their own cartoons.  Morgan's video clips of him working while he carries his new baby in a baby carrier is awesome",1396051200,,1723,4.7
8505559,5,B006WDE87A,"""A Year in the Day"" is Gustafer Yellowgold's White Album. More rocking, more harmonically and instrumentally varied than the previous four albums. Sample ""Four Leaved Clover"", ""Eggs"", and ""Pumpkin Pied"" for a taste.

And with no overarching story or new character to introduce, each song expresses itself as a pure soft pop-rock confection.

For the first time in five albums, every track has made its way onto Dad's iPod playlist.

Oh, and the boy loves it too!",1334361600,,462,4.974025974025974
8505560,4,B006WDE87A,"Gustafer Yellowgold is a creature from the sun, and Year in the Day is a collection of songs loosely connected with holidays around the year:
  New Is The New Old (New Year)
  Shadow (Groundhog Day)
  Keep It Simple Sweetheart (Valentine's Day)
  Pancake Smackdown (Shrove Tuesday)
  Four Leaved Clover (St. Patrick's Day)
  Eggs (Easter)
  Midsummer's Son (Midsummer's Day)
  Fireworks! (Independence Day)
  Werewolves Rock (Halloween)
  Pumpkin Pied (Thanksgiving)
  Fa and a La (Christmas)

This package includes both a CD of songs and a DVD with sweet, simple drawings and minimal animation. The DVD contains the same songs as the CD, but the illustrations add a little more story.

The words don't make a whole lot of sense, frankly.

""Maybe moon, maybe duck/ Feel the change in your luck,
'Cause nobody is ready for a pancake smackdown.""

This couplet from ""Pancake Smackdown,"" a Shrove Tuesday song, is fairly typical. The pictures for the DVD show a moon-shaped pancake and a duck-shaped pancake, so they add a bit of sense to the song, but... not that much.

Still, I found that the songs lingered with me. ""Werewolves rock,"" I'd find myself singing, ""in my heart."" And some, if approached in the same spirit with which you approach Magic Eye pictures, begin to seem sensible:
""I never turned an angel away.
Just the same, I never got one to stay.
If it's true what they said, that romance is dead,
then keep it simple, sweetheart, and kiss me.""

The music is reminiscent of Donovan and other dreamy folk-rock musicians of that era. Dreaminess is, in fact, a major characteristic of the performance. You can go to [...] to get backstories that might tie things together a bit, but why? Accept the nonsensical nature of the words, and sing them when you play the DVD karaoke style.

There's also a section of guitar lessons and a ""the making of"" section showing singer/songwriter Morgan Taylor at work through the year, often with his baby nearby.

All in all, it's a fun album, and small children should enjoy the DVD a lot.",1334188800,,2033,4.825581395348837
8505561,5,B006WDE87A,"As a huge Gustafer Yellowgold fan, I was very excited to get my hands on the brand new album ,""Gustafer Yellowgold's Year in the Day,"" a quirky and imaginative interpretation of 11 different Earth Holidays. Before we could watch the DVD, my 8-year-old son was determined to identify the Holiday in each song (as there is no mention of the actual name of the Holiday), which made watching the ""reveal"" on the DVD that much more exciting.  The brilliant husband and wife team, Morgan Taylor and Rachel Loshak have put together yet another amazing DVD/CD set that is enjoyable for the whole family!

""Year in the Day"" is the perfect mix of fun and upbeat tempos and mellow sweetness that Morgan Taylor ""soft rocks"" out like no one else, and captures genuine child-like innocence and curiosity. You aren't going to find yourself going on a musical journey like this anywhere else- from relishing in the joy of having a shadow (""A Shadow""), a sweet romance between an eel and his sock puppet (""Keep it Simple Sweetheart""), a fashion-conscious flightless pterodactyl finding a lucky 4-leaf clover suit(""4 Leaf Clover"") surprise pancake attacks (""Pancake Smackdown""), and ending on a joyous note, bringing this clan of quirky characters together to celebrate their friendship (""Fa and a La"")! It's impossible not to sing, dance, and laugh while watching the DVD or listening to the CD!

For those of us who know and love Gustafer, there is a fun smattering of characters from over the last 4 albums that make an appearance in the videos, so keep your eye out for them!  Even Cheddar, Forrest Applecrumbie's beloved cat, makes an appearance in ""Werewolf Rock"" (hey, wait a minute...)!

Time to take that Wiggles CD out of your car and replace it with ""Year in the Day!"" You won't be able to drop your kids off at school or practice, and NOT turn up the volume just a little bit louder, and sing at the top of your lungs while driving away.  It's darn near impossible... and trust me, you won't get any of the weird stares you'd be getting if you were singing ""fruit salad, yummy yummy!""

Keep it yellow!",1333843200,3,2095,4.723287671232876
