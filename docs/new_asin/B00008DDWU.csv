1835428,4,B00008DDWU,"I bought this set because I wanted to collect every Peter Ustinov portrayal of Hercule Poirot. Two of the movies are fabulous. As for ""The Mirror Cracked"", Ustinov is not in the cast and I could do without the plot as well. Nonethe less, I'm glad I purchased the set.",1191628800,,267,4.36
1835429,4,B00008DDWU,"I'm going to quickly cite some of my qualifications for rating these 3 films because it's relevant to what I have to say: I'm a HUGE Christie fan -- I've read every book/play (some 2 or 3 times) that she wrote (over 80 in all), her Mary Westmacott pseudonym stuff, her tome of an autobiography (not a very good or honest work, BTW!), and all the films and TV productions of Christie mysteries that are available to date.

Now, I will begin by noting that, for me, there are essentially 3 facets to evaluating a ""Christie film"" -- 1. Was it a good book to begin with? -- some are excellent, some are pretty lame, 2. How closely did the screenwriter adhere to the original work?, and, 3. Did the acting come off as ""genuine"" or was it hokey? (Christie stories, in particular, always manifest the dreaded potential to come off badly in the hands of an unskilled director). For example, to give you a measuring stick, the best Christie film ever is:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Murder-on-the-Orient-Express/dp/B0002I832C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express</a>

A REVISION! Here is yet another brilliant Christie film! (see my review):

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ten-Little-Indians-Desyat-Negrityat/dp/B0002EB68E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ten Little Indians / Desyat' Negrityat</a>

This set of three DVDs are, in the aggregate, ""good films,"" worth the price -- unfortunately, given that they were obviously high-budget films, they COULD have all been spectacular, but that simply did not happen. I'll take them from best to worst.

""Evil Under the Sun"" is the star of the three. Like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (which is not in this set), it's chock-full of big names: Peter Ustinov (as Poirot), James Mason, Roddy Macdowall, Colin Blakely, and others. It takes place on a resort island, an actress is murdered on a remote beach, and Poirot has to unmask the murderer at the conclusion -- standard Poirot formula. If Ustinov does not exactly fit the profile of the book Poirot, he certainly makes up for it in a fine performance. All performances are a bit overplayed but it still comes off nicely -- it's in letterbox and the cinematography is spectacular. For me, it just makes the 5-star rating that I gave it. I definitely recommend it to all viewers.

The second film in the set is ""Death on the Nile,"" which was one of Christie's finest mysteries ever; however, this movie has a few problems, the first being that the director clearly depended upon all the big stars to simply ""carry"" the film. Included are Peter Ustinov (as Poirot), Bette Davis, David Niven, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, George Kennedy, Jack Warden, and others. The film was produced in 1978 and all these actors were pretty much well past their primes. Again, Ustinov pulls off a super performance and I especially liked Mia Farrow too. The great David Niven was okay but the remainder pretty much stunk in their roles. Angela Lansbury, as a drunken has-been writer of fiction, was simply terrible. The story itself revolves around a honeymoon couple's (the bride is RICH!) boat tour (bulging with enemies of the bride) up the Nile River where the bride is ultimately murdered, a bullet to the head. There is also a second murder, I won't say who as that would be a spoiler. Again, Poirot has to expose the culprit at the end. The film is in letterbox format and the cinematography is magnificent. I should also say that this is not a boring film -- the activity and scenery will keep Christie fans  interested throughout. Had the movie people cast fewer big names and focused a lot more on telling the story in a serious manner, this would have been an easy 5 -- I reluctantly give it a 4 and definitely recommend it to all Christie fans. Other viewers might only make it halfway through the film.

The third DVD is ""The Mirror Crack'd,"" another pretty good Christie book -- and, again, we are presented with an overage of big names.... and I mean BIG! Angela Lansbury, Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis and Edward Fox, the latter giving a VERY fine performance, maybe even ""saving"" the film for me in the second half. The story: A frumpy local woman is murdered (poisoned) as she attends a high-end theatrical party with hundreds present... but was she the intended victim? This time, Miss Marple (Christie's top female snooper), of course, reveals all at the conclusion. I must sadly report that Angela Lansbury played Miss Marple, deplorably, and it's equally sad that the screenwriters departed significantly from Chistie's rendering of the favorite lady amateur detective's profile. Lansbury comes off as very assertive, not humble at all, and even puffs away at a non-filtered coffin nail near the end of the flick, an act that would have appalled Christie's Miss Marple. I'm a huge Elizabeth Taylor fan and she conveyed her character quite well, as expected -- unfortunately, this film was shot in 1980 and Liz was a lumbering side of Hereford beef, sporting 2 1/2 chins -- I was much saddened by this has-been appearance. Hudson, who played her husband, was similarly worn-looking with very bad make-up. Throughout the movie, he looked as if he'd been on a week-long bender. At one point, in a sort of love scene, he's lying on the bed, face up, and Taylor launches herself on to him -- you could almost hear the air hiss out of poor guy and old Rock additionally didn't seem to know what to do with his arms and hands as they didn't encircle her all that effectively. Then, the camera angle switches to Taylor's face, scrunched up on Hudson's shoulder, and it takes on a gargoyle-ish essence -- the editors should have caught this but, like the rest of the movie, you get the idea that this one was all about ""yielding product,"" and nothing about creating art. The entire film is like this -- a ""has-been actors' struggle"" I would call it. Fox plays the Scotland Yard Inspector, (and loyal nephew to Lansbury/Marple), and, again, he saves the film from being a complete fizzle. Poor Tony Curtis looked as if he'd been run through a tree shredder, with very bad, scruffy-looking, (and very little) hair. Christie fans will like this film okay but I can't recommend it to anyone else. Positive aspects include the letterbox format and very nice cinematography. To conclude this one, I give it a 3 on the low end.

So there you have it.",1190678400,9,6488,4.955882352941177
1835430,5,B00008DDWU,I was so delighted to find these wonderful Agatha Christie mysteries out on DVD finally I've seen them all a few times but the stories are still intriguing. It's also a delight to see many of the old stars in their glory days and some of today's stars in their beginning roles. I love a movie that can be watched over and over again and not lose its freshness. These movies definitely fit that category.,1179014400,,403,4.386666666666667

To think that you could be in Luxor in the morning and Abu Simbel before sunset can only be movie magic.  But, I loved it anyway.",1178409600,,396,3.8271604938271606
1835433,5,B00008DDWU,"This only concerns ""Death on the Nile"".

This blockbusting film adapted from Agatha Christie's novel is the very archetype and acme of her detective stories, at least those using the services of the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot from Brussels. She builds up a closed set of people who are all concerned by the murder that is committed in a closed environment. They all have some personal interest to commit this crime, hence a motive, and none of them have an alibi, at least a real alibi. They can all have done it and Poirot is going to use his Belgian brain to sort out the facts and bring out the truth, as a reconstruction that is intended to trap or trick the culprit. And it works. That's how the mystery is resolved. One shady corner can be found though: the cobra in Poirot's bathroom will remain unexplained. It must have been overlooked at some moment in the making of the film because Agatha Christie would never do such a mistake.

1836103,5,B00008DDWU,"I love all 3 of these movies, but as some reviews here mention, The Mirror Crack'd is the weakest (but still worth seeing).  Death on the Nile is the best in my opinion.  It has the best stars (Bette Davis and Maggie Smith each playing off each other with the best and most humorous chemistry of any 2 characters in these 3 films).  In later years, I recall that Davis lamented that they didn't do more or show more with these 2 characters in Death on the Nile.  She was quite right.  The scenery was also best in Death On The Nile.  Of course, Peter Ustinov brings a warm comedic and necessary arrogance to the role.  I have only seen one other actor play Hercule Poirot and that was Albert Finny in Murder on the Orient Express.  This is completely different; lighter and funnier without straying from Agatha Christie and the mystery.  The DVD bonuses are nice, of course, but Nicholas Clay in a black speedo in Evil Under the Sun is the best bonus of all.",1394755200,3,958,4.367231638418079

Peter brings a dash of humor to the role but doesn't spare the ""little grey cells"".  Love these, wish there were more made with Ustinov, he really brings a different dimension to the role.

1836263,4,B00008DDWU,"these are three entertaing whodunits.  each film features great ensemble casts.  Evil Under the Sun boasts some beautiful scenic photography along with some wonderful Cole Porter background music.  Death on the Nile is Peter Ustinov's first foray as Hercule Poriot and does a credbile job  as long as you realize the portly Mr Ustinov doesn't match up to the prissy character invented by the prolific Agatha Christie.  think Albert Finney in Murder on the Orient Express for the perfect film Poriot.  i never  had the opportunity to see David Suchet essay the role on TV so i cannot make any comparision,  The Mirror Cracked has Angela Lansbury as the Old Maid Sleuth, Miss Marple ans  she plays the part the way it was written, except that she's too young and attractive to be Miss Marple.  if you're only interesed in comic relief, then see Margret Rutherford in her series of Miss Marple films.  her take on the role is as a pfummfing busy body, alwaysa butting in where she shouldn't be and annoying the pants off everyone she meets.  she's  kind of an english Lt Columbo. in every one  of her Miss Marple films  her husband Stringer Davis is dragged along mostly to keep telling her ""Miss Marple, you really shouldn't be doing this, you know""  Miss Marple as wriiten never involved herself in the mystery, but used ""leg men"" the clues she's uncovered.  this is the way Angela Lansbury plays Miss Marple in the Mirror Cracked and does a whale of a job.  the film begins witha film within a film featuring some well know english character actors in a movie night at the vicarage.  the film breaks and everyone is clearly diappointed that they won't have  the mystery solved, until the redoubtable Miss Marple solves the crime, sending everyone home  more or less satisfied.  despite a badly sprained ankle, Miss Marple is able to solve a series of killings in her peaceful rural town.

i would reccomend this three disc set to anyone who enjoys Agatha Christie mysteries as well as well produced films of these thrillers.  one interesting aside  about The Mirror Cracked is that it takes place circa 1952/53  and the motion picture producer played by Tony Curtis drives up with his movie diva wife Kim Novak in a huge tail finned 1959 Caddy.  i guess he  got his auto order in early.  an yway ENJOY THE FILM ANYWAY.",1314144000,,2318,4.682382133995037

1836266,4,B00008DDWU,"in my opinion at least, people should own a film because they themselves  enjoy it.  their enjoyment can cover many different facets such  as story, cast, director perhaps and production values  the largest guage of enjoyment should be if they would like to see the film, or favorite portions multiple times to savor more completely  their pleasure.  if you purchase a DVD and it ends up on a shelf to gather dust, then the best part of owning a film is lost.

some people watch a film expecting to find perfection and this rarely happens.  all this does is create an aura of frustration and disappointment.  the most important thing to remember is that if you enjoy the film, is not to let others change your mind just because of their fault finding.  many will just find fault because they like to pick any film apart like an artichoke until there is nothing left.

by the way, i find it rather amusing that while THE MIRROR CRACKED is supposed to take place somewhere around 1953, the film producer character of Tony Curtis, sporting a very close crew cut, and his diva film star/wife Kim Novak, arrive at the  fete and make a grand entrance driving a 1959 Caddy Convertible, a glaring error of continuity, or was it an inside joke?  even such a self important film proucer would be  hard pressed to obtain a model automobile that wouldn't be produced until several years later.a better choice for a  vehicle to utilize would have been a Bentley or Rolls, since  they would be difficult to guess their ages.",1299974400,,1510,4.599250936329588

1836303,5,B00008DDWU,"I am not going to read any of the reviews to this product as I write this review because I want to be honest without being annoyed or furious at other reviews.
This is a magnificent box set, make no mistakes. For three tales involved in murder they are also quiet walks into decision, fact finding, and who done it hunting. The back drops are anything from a royal blue boat, quaint cottages, or a sunny beach resort. All three, to me, are of the same quality, none exactly the same. Peter Ustinov in two tales, Angela in one, none better than the other.
All three rely alot on an angle of comedy, and over acting by the major cast, and even supporting cast.
I am glad Albert Finney was not included as Peter is the prime detective incarnate. Angela is not to be compared to any other Miss Marple ever done before. This is strictly Angela's interpretation of the role, and once you get by that, you can totally accept it. Everyone looks like they are having fun doing these roles no matter how exasperated the role demands them to be.
There is still a long way to go with classic movies being released on dvd formats or dvd sets, but this is one for the books. This is a very good box set, there is no clunker.
And at least they provide these fabulous films in the entire form. Something you will not get if you intend to watch these on cable channels with commercials. Edited versions always bother me, especially when involving who done its. Like Miss Marple clearly states, ""Solving a mystery is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. You can't see the whole picture unless you have all the pieces.""

1836306,5,B00008DDWU,"The AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MYSTERY COLLECTION: DEATH ON THE NILE/ THE MIRROR CRACK'D/ EVIL UNDER THE SUN three DVD set is a good buy.

I remember seeing ""Death On The Nile"" on television on ""the late show"" when I was a kid and I really loved it so that brought me here to Amazon and this set.

Since ""Death..."" was the only one I saw the other two were a treat. If you haven't seen any of these Agatha Christie movies they're pretty cool. Each feature has a star studded cast and takes place in exotic locales, with many of the characters  British and very memorable.

The plots are basically the same where one character is a despicable person and everyone has good reason to want that character dead. Naturally they end up dead and it's up to Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) to figure out which person out of the group is the actual killer.

Anyway, both ""Death On The Nile"" and ""Evil Under The Sun"" push this set into the 5-star category.

""The Mirror Crack'd"" was OK and Kim Novak was hilarious as ""Lola Brewster,"" Elizabeth Taylor's character's nemesis, and though the setting was a quaint English town and it was charming, Angela Lansbury as Jane Marple seemed only to be in the background helping her nephew solve the case. Although it's not bad it's not on the same level as the other two.

The picture quality on all three movies is pretty good and have been formatted for widescreen, so it looks great on widescreen televisions. There are some special features on ""Death..."" and ""Evil..."" which are as follows:

*****  EVIL UNDER THE SUN SPECIALS  *****

TRAILER

""THE MAKING OF EVIL...""--about 16-minutes
Cool behind-the-scenes of the movie, reminds me of those old fashioned newsreels, where the director and the cast including Peter Ustinov, Maggie Smith, and Diana Rigg among others discuss the film and their respective characters. The featurette is a little foggy, but viewable, and was filmed back then.

Behind-the-scenes where producer John Brabourne discusses the movie and the production designer talks about the ship that had to be built as well as filming on the actual Nile River in Egypt. Actors Peter Ustinov, David Niven, and Jon Finch talk about their roles and actor George Kennedy talks about working with Bette Davis. Again, the footage is a little foggy and I wish this featurette were longer and had more information about filming in the other locations throughout Egypt, especially the famous ones, because those were really spectacular in the movie. The featurette was filmed back then.

INTERVIEW WITH PETER USTINOV--8:46-minutes--Spanish with English Sub-titles (or no sub-titles option).
Ustinov is interviewed for Spanish TV and he speaks fluent Spanish! I believe this interview was done for the London Premiere of ""Death...""

INTERVIEW WITH JANE BIRKIN--4:28-minutes--English with some Spanish.
Taken at the same time and place as the Ustinov interview with the same reporter, Birkin is teased for carrying a ""pig basket"" as a purse, which is ironic because she is now the designer for the very expensive Birkin Bag (made famous on HBO's ""Sex & The City""), and he asks her about her role in the movie and her singing career with Serge Gainsbourg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jane-Birkin-et-Serge-Gainsbourg/dp/B000058TLF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jane Birkin et Serge Gainsbourg</a>).

Even though I know how the mystery ends, I'll still watch these flicks over and over again because the cast, especially Ustinov, is great and the locations are just beautiful. If you like whodunits this set is a definite for your collection!

UPDATE 07/20/15:
I have since learned that Jane Birkin was NOT the designer of the ""Birkin Bag,"" but was the inspiration for Herms to design a bag, after CE Jean-Lousi Dumas met Birkin on a plane and her stuff fell out of a bag she was carrying, and so he named it after her.",1266537600,36,4007,5.057750759878419
1836307,5,B00008DDWU,I enjoyed the story line and the humor in this movie.  Peter Ustinov's character of Hercule Poirot is so entertaining to watch and I loved Maggie Smith as well.  It is one of those movies that I could watch many times (and have done so).,1252627200,13,237,4.2444444444444445
1836308,5,B00008DDWU,"This is a good adaptation from the book.  After watching ""Evil under the Sun"" ASIN: B000059LGF and ""Appointment with Death"" ASIN: 0790741318 you naturally think of Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot.  The whole movie is packed with great actors, yet even thought you recognize them they do not distract from the characters that they play.

I thought that it was a nice touch when the kids along the shore mooned Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis) as kids would do everywhere.

Simon (Simon MacCorkindale) and his new bride Linnet (Lois Chiles) are being perused by Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) the girl he jilted.  Once onboard a boat down the Nile bodies are dropping like flies.  Everyone is a suspect.  Everybody could have done it.  And yet nobody could have done it.  Only Hercule Poirot can figure this out.  Naturally Hercule Poirot is in the right place at the right time to hear everything and extract the truth.

Hercule Poirot shows proper swimming techniques
Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot is challenged to locate a missing jewel.  To do this he must go to a small island.  Guess who has a tendency to get seasick?  He requests his fee in guineas (a guinea is equivalent of 21 shillings.)

Naturally someone/s is unexplainably dispatched.  Of course the island is loaded with the usual suspects.  Everyone has a motive and an alibi.  By this time you have completely forgotten how the movie started.
Speaking about the movie, they pulled out all the stops with expensive locations, costumes, and actors.  And Cole Porter tossed in for ambiance.  There was even an appearance of Roddy McDowall who played Alan ""Mollymauk"" Musgrave in ""Lord Love A Duck"" ASIN: 6304237707

[Crak'd]
The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side,
The later version of this movie, based on a novel, Christie, ""Agatha.  Mirror Crack'd, The"", the film Miss Marple: The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side (1992) (TV) (UK: series title) ASIN: 6303111580.  Stays true to form.  Joan Hickson is Miss Marple.  Agatha Christie always considered her as the ideal Miss Marple; she shows this through her reserve savvy.  Jane takes an interactive interest in the mystery and yet each character as part of the discovery, stands on their own.  The ending of the story is as is in life, it is appropriate for the situation and not black and white judgmental.

This version of this movie ""The Mirror Crack'd (1980) ASIN: 6302990149"" was made with a lot of glitzy characters.  Some of them were quite good such as Rock Hudson (Jason Rudd).  Others were distracting as they let their real personalities overwhelm the characters.  One of the worst was Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Miss Jane Marple; she was much too cutesy.  Jane has this way of looking at you like she knows something.

This film was to Americanize (black and white, judgmental.) and half the characters were combined for brevity.",1248739200,3,2871,4.890041493775934
1836309,4,B00008DDWU,"This box set from Anchor Bay offers two of Peter Ustinov's six films as Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot.  Between 1978 and 1988, Ustinov starred as the detective in three theatrical films and three made-for-television movies.  This set offers his two earliest (theatrical) performances, and as a ""bonus,"" the set provides the 1980 Miss Marple film, ""The Mirror Cracked,"" the weakest of the films in this set.  Angela Landsbury is sadly miscast as Miss Marple, though the supporting cast (Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, etc.) make it bearable.

A number of actors have portrayed Poirot over the years, and in my opinion, Peter Ustinov is still the best.  Arguably, these first two films are the best of his series, and while it's a shame that there is not a complete six-film DVD box set available, I am just happy to see these great mysteries released on DVD.  Anchor Bay has done another good job with this production, from offering a few vintage special features on each film to reproducing the original poster art as an insert.

For fans of Ustinov, this is naturally a must-own set.  For collectors, his three Poirot made-for-TV films are available as a separate 3-DVD set, and the final theatrical film is also available separately on DVD.  All can be found right here on Amazon.",1231977600,,1295,4.9036697247706424
1836310,3,B00008DDWU,"As of this writing, there isn't any indication as to what three movies are packaged together as ""Agatha Christie's Mysteries Collection.""  While it isn't much of a mystery, let's solve it, anyway.  Per the packaging I saw for the item, these are the three films: Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot in 1978's ""Death on the Nile"" and its 1982 follow-up, ""Evil Under the Sun;"" and Angela Lansbury in her only outing as Miss Marple in 1980's ""The Mirror Crack'd.""

It makes logical sense to consider these three movies as a trilogy, since the producers essentially released them as such.  Of the three, the big budget ""Death on the Nile"" still holds up as a terrific Egyptian whodunnit with all-star cast members including David Niven, Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Jack Warden, Mia Farrow, and Angela Lansbury at her most vampish.  To his credit, Ustinov nimbly glides his way through the film as a most formidable Poirot with a comic touch unlike his predecessor, Albert Finney, in the superior ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" which would have been a wonderful added attraction here (if not for the fact that a different studio owns it).

Four years later, Peter Ustinov then moves on to the Mediterranean in ""Evil Under the Sun,"" which also stars Diana Rigg, Roddy McDowall, Maggie Smith (in a different role), among others, in a leisurely paced murder mystery at an exotic resort.  The film and its Cole Porter musical score have aged fairly well on their own merits, but the movie, which indulges more than its share of dragging moments, has been surpassed by David Suchet's subsequent, more faithful adaptation.

Lastly, ""The Mirror Crack'd"" at least foreshadows why Angela Lansbury would later deftly fit the role of Jessica Fletcher in the ""Murder, She Wrote,"" television series four years later.  The film also stars Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, Elizabeth Taylor, among others, including a briefly seen Pierce Brosnan, in a plot involving a murder attempt on a high-strung actress at a lavish party.  Overall, the movie isn't bad (boring might be a better word), but it stands up better if you are more interested in star watching, particularly if you are an Elizabeth Taylor fan.

Overall, our grade is the following:

""Death on the Nile"": A-
""Evil Under the Sun"": B-
""The Mirror Crack'd"": C
The Whole Package: B.",1229731200,44,2310,4.910025706940874
