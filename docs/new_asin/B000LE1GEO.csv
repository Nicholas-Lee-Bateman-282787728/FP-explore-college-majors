2707227,5,B000LE1GEO,"If you like Country Music like me, you will love The Hee Haw Collection I've got many Episodes and they are Great Fun to watch. The Shows are Beautifully Transferred to DVDs. The Colors are very Clear, Bright and Colorful the Sound is very Strong and Powerful considering some of these Shows go back to 1969.

The Hee Haw Shows were a Summer replacement Series for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Each Week co-hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark and the cast of Comedians and Musicians would Welcome the Biggest Stars in Country Music to perform their Songs and help deliver the one-liners

Episode 372 was Taped in 1983 Full Color 50 Minutes with Guests George Strait and The Statler Brothers. Time Life gives you one Episode per DVD and I think they should include at least two of them. Hee Haw Ranked in the Top 20 Nationwide in 1971. I never get tired of watching the Episodes

I love the Old Style Country Music with the Original Instruments nothing like today, most Artists don't even use the Steel Guitar any more which by the way it goes back to 1922 and earlier. The Hee Haw Collection is Part of American Musical History and I love to be able to watch all the Episodes and Collect them now! ..Thank You D.D.",1354838400,,1215,4.48868778280543

2707231,1,B000LE1GEO,"I bought this for my elderly mother and I tried to watch it with her and I just couldn't.  So much is wasted on repeating skits done by everyone doing the same thing, bloopers that aren't funny to begin with, but when they introduced Tammy Wynette a dozen times, to show different hair styles over the years, along with 10 seconds of a song she was to sing, I had enough. Pretty much crap.",1308700800,,389,4.256756756756757

2707233,5,B000LE1GEO,"***SPOILERS INCLUDED***

This episode of the legendary country music show comes from 1983 and it's notable as George Strait's only appearance. George performs two songs, ""Amarillo By Morning"" and ""A Fire I Can't Put Out"". He appears in the Kornfield and delivers some one-liners plus delivers the name of his home town, which gets the Hee-Haw Salute treatment. There's a quick one-liner by Strait edited into the scene after a particularly sensual Hee-Haw Honey is through delivering a line.

The two hosts, Buck Owens and Roy Clark, are featured in music numbers which was customary each week. Buck performs ""There's Something About Me that She Loves"" and Roy does a musical number with his musical family called ""Heel and Toe Polka"".

Don Harron's hilarious sketch as the KORN news reporter is featured along with the weather girl, which was a feature during this era in the show's run. The Naggers appear in a skit with a coming of age theme where their son, Elrod, jokes around with his father about how nice looking women make him feel. Ida Lee can't stand the father-son conversation and by skit's end she's hitting them over the head with whatever she can grab.

The opening skit is the ""Hee-Haw Honky Tonk"" which was part of the show in the early to mid 1980's during the Urban Cowboy era in country music. Each week Roy and Buck would sit atop a bandstand and Buck would play his red, white, and blue guitar and Roy played the banjo and they'd sing musical interludes in between bad jokes told by several members of the cast who were all seated in the honky tonk. Jackie Phelps played the bartender.

The Statler Brothers do appear a lot but they're so funny...especially in the Kornfield when they run a blooper reel of the four of them trying to get through a mother-in-law joke. A lot of people do not realize that the Statler Brothers were equally famous for their comedic banter...they even did a comedy album called ""Lester Roadhog Moran"" and several other humorous recordings under the Roadhog banner...so it shouldn't come as no surprise that the Hee-Haw producer would want to use a guest's comedic qualities.

The four of them do the ""Gloom, Despair, and Agony"" skit and the ""Pffft! You Was Gone!"" skit as well. For the latter, Harold sings the lyrics and elbows Don and Phil but they keep their backs to the camera...as Harold fakes nervousness as the skit is ""not going as planned"" he reaches over and taps Jimmy but he too remains with his back to the camera...and just as they get to the part where they climax with ""Pffttt!!! You Was Gone"" they all turn around and do the bronx cheer on Harold, who ducks out of the way. They perform ""Guilty"" and ""I Get So Lonely"".

In my opinion, though, this is just ONE show regardless of the fact the regular cast-members who typically appeared on those two aforementioned skits were replaced on this show by the Statler Brothers. The show is still just as humorous and entertaining as ever.

The original air-date for this episode was November 12, 1983. It was the 9th episode during the 1983-1984 season and the three hundred seventy second episode {372} in all.

Be on the look out for a cameo by Shotgun Red, the puppet that was just starting to become a favorite during that decade.",1240185600,5,3249,4.676007005253941
2707234,2,B000LE1GEO,"I realize the Statlers were big at the time and having them as guests was probably a big-deal booking for the show.  But they were inserted into so many skits that I missed the regular cast. Let's be honest here too, yes the Statlers have stage chops... but not for skit comedy.",1206489600,2,278,4.346153846153846
