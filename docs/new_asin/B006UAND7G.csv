8504472,4,B006UAND7G,"Thoroughly enjoyed this creative, quirky, ""Fargo-esque"" mystery, set in NYC.  Funny ensemble cast, especially the 2 sleep clinic med students who monitor their wealthy patients.  It took a bit of a deranged mind to think this up, thankfully.",1335830400,,241,5.315789473684211
8504473,4,B006UAND7G,"I saw this film at a festival in Los Angeles. Good writing! Clever dialogue--and such an
interesting setting. Some mystery and a real twist at the end.
Good acting, too. I certainly recommend it!",1335484800,,195,4.764705882352941
8504474,5,B006UAND7G,"When patients enter this sleep clinic, they expect some reprieve from their sleepless nights. In this new indie movie, maybe they get some rest, a chance to dream, but we are on the edge of our seats. Alternating from hilarity to horror, this black comedy unfolds revealing the dark side that envelops even the ""good"" guys. Don't want to reveal much more but definitely a ""must-see"" -the clever banter between the sleep technicians is worth the purchase.",1334361600,2,454,4.909090909090909
8504475,4,B006UAND7G,"I saw this movie at a film festival in NYC. I had no expectations coming into it. I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this indie flick was. I especially enjoyed the interplay between the two main characters - lots of amusing repartee that comes off very naturally, not like the forced humor I see in a lot of movies with ""name brand"" casts.",1332115200,,348,4.453125
8504476,4,B006UAND7G,"Saw this movie at a Film Festival in NYC - really intriguing.
Didn't guess the ending. Great characters from main actors to supporting roles. Don't want to spoil the plot...",1331337600,,173,4.8
