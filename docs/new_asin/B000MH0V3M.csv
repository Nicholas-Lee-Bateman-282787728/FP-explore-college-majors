2736095,4,B000MH0V3M,"Kenny Rogers makes a danged good preacher in this movie, which opens with a sermon on turning the other cheek.  His nephew does his best to live by Jesus' words, even when war is declared after the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, after continued taunting, harassment, and finally the rape of his fianc by the boys in one family, his resolve is severely tested.  Just where does Jesus' admonition to turn the other cheek end and legitimate defense begin?  That is the question that must be answered in this movie.  [I am reminded of one of the 2008 Presidential candidates who naively said he would not need to fight Islamic terrorists because if we are nice to them they wouldn't want to destroy Western culture.]  The boys in that bad family didn't seem to get that message when Johnny had one where he could beat the tar out of him after he'd done one disgusting act, but chose to not harm the brother.  [All three brothers were involved in the rape.]  Traditional values families should be able to enjoy this movie, and it would be great for family discussion of the main issue in this movie.",1225411200,2,1097,4.561224489795919

2736100,4,B000MH0V3M,"I first saw this when I was in my teens and enjoyed it very much. So, I was very happy that it finally got released on DVD. And I must say that it is still as enjoyable. Kenny Rogers is excellent as Pastor Matthew and a natural. A very young Fredric Lane (from ""Lost"" and ""Supernatural"") is equally good as Tommy. I have been a fan of his since I saw him as ""Tommy"".

Production-wise, the dvd is ok. Although the sound is good, the images are at times grainy. But it has transferred relatively well to dvd considering how ""old"" the original movie was. There are no extras which is a pity. It would have been nice to hear Mr Rogers and Mr Lane's take on their roles and the making of this classic.

The dvd is a good buy and one to treasure for Rogers and Lane fans.",1188345600,14,765,4.093333333333334
2736101,4,B000MH0V3M,"I have always loved Kenny Rogers, even as I progressed onto other artists from Timbaland to Nsync over the years. But, I have always loved going back to listening his music. His movies are something that you have to like if you like Westerns. However, Coward of the County is a story exactly like the song. If you like the song by him..you will like the movie.",1186444800,,360,4.388059701492537

2736139,1,B000MH0V3M,"I remembered watching this as a teenager when it was a movie made for television, and thought I liked it.  I ordered it because my husband really likes the song and I told him there was a movie that went with it.  It turns out that I do not like it as well as I remembered.  We have 3 teenage sons and are always looking for decent, moral material that they can enjoy.  This movie, if rated, should be PG-13 for thematic elements - made for an older audience.  This mainly has to do with coarse innuendos, rape, and a preacher who drinks and does not live a clean christian lifestyle.  We were hoping that this was a good show in which our boys could see that fighting is not always the answer.  After watching this, we agreed that our kids will not see this movie.  I wish I had not purshaased it at all.",1371081600,,805,4.148387096774194

2736170,5,B000MH0V3M,Coward of the county is one of Kenny Rogers best efforts. The story line was well set within that time period.  The conflicts facing both the characters and the nation at that time stimulated the intensity of these events.  All the actors played well supporting roles set within this small Georgia town.
