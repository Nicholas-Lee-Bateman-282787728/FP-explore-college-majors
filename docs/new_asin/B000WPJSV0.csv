8225080,2,B000WPJSV0,"Code of the Cactus was made in 1939 and times were simpler then, well, at least as far as B-Westerns were concerned.  Cattle rustlers were the bad guys with plans that had no chance of working out and the gunfights were comical (especially in retrospect).  All of it now looks like child's play compared to modern day action movies and real life terrorists.  There isn't much of interest here, other than Tim McCoy opening his eyes real wide for the camera when trouble's a-brewing.  And his undercover Mexican persona and comical Mexican accent would never be allowed today; it would come off as racist (of course, times were different then; different eras different standards).  I can't figure out if the actors were playing their parts for laughs or if they were trying to be serious.  In McCoy's case, I think he was going for laughs whenever possible, or at least a certain level of jolliness.  The other movie -- which contains some of the same actors -- wasn't much better.  These movies are a trip down memory lane to more simple times.  But as movies go, there's not too much to commend them.  Will I ever watch these movies again?  Probably not.",1500422400,,1155,4.6683168316831685

""Code of the Cactus"" from Victory Pictures looks good, but has a handful of dialogue splices and 1 scene that looks to be cut into late.  ""Fighting Renegade"", also from Victory, has a handful of dialogue splices and some poor audio.  Both films appear to be basically complete based on running times.  Many of these westerns can be found from different sources with dialogue splices in different scenes. When is someone going to put together some of these features from 2-3 sources.",1356912000,2,599,4.613207547169812
