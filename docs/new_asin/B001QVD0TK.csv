I thought there would be more footage of the men on the cover. Very disappointing. Save your money imagine them wrestling, would be Better.",1512000000,,257,4.48936170212766

8336531,5,B001QVD0TK,Ric Flair and Sgt. Slaughter are two of the best in professional wrestling history. They both deserve their place in the WWE Hall of Fame. Good matches on here.,1363651200,,160,4.551724137931035
8336532,5,B001QVD0TK,"I mainly got this set for the Thunderdome Cage Match between Sting/Flair versus Funk/Muta. The discussion is pretty lame IMO, then again I'm not a fan of Ross, Hayes, Mike Graham or Dusty Rhodes. Mike Graham's comments about Flair making stars out of Lex Luger and Sting and I quote him here ""Stars that had no business being in our business, no passion no athletic ability"" That Sting guy only made a what? 25-30 year career? but he has no business being in wrestling?

I expect a lot of Flair smooching, I mean that's what WWE does you thnk he was sleeping with the boss' daughter lol. Outside of that the discussion is pretty lackluster and Michael Hayes brings his typical unimaginative and un-creative insight into the careers of Seargeant SLaughter and Ric Flair (and this guy is a writer for WWE....which explains a lot haha)

Matches are good best one being the Thunder Cage tag match.

Slaughter versus Mike Routando is a TV squash match.
Slaughter versus Bob Backlund in a Texas Deathmatch isn't very hardcore but physical and for it's era was ""hardcore""
Slaughter versus Iron Shiek is a brawl from the get go with non stop action and a very hot crowd.
Slaughter versus Col. DeBeers in a boot camp match was okay, nothing spectacular and becomes a cluster at the end with Searge winning.
Flair versus Luger from Starrcade was good typical Flair versus power wrestler match. Flair stalls, Luger over powers Flair gets the win.
Flair/Sting versus Funk/Muta was a cool spectacle with solid wrestling Bruno Sammartino is the special guest referee. The match is very good with four tremendous workers in the ring (Yeah Mike I called Sting a tremendous worker!)
Flair versus Curt Hennig from Nitro solid match but not to the level of the loser leaves town match from Raw.",1347148800,2,1775,4.7564935064935066
8336533,3,B001QVD0TK,While I didn't enjoy the discussion as much as previous ones I really only bought this for the thunder cage match with Flair/Sting w/Ole Anderson vs Funk/Muta w/Gary Hart. That match is worth the price alone as anyone knows we probably won't ever see a Halloween havoc anthology or even a best of. The other matches were pretty weak. I was excited to see Flair/Hennig from nitro until I saw it wasn't the brawl they had in Minneapolis but rather a later bout when Hennig was part of the West Texas Rednecks. It also has the Flair/Luger match from starrcade thats already on the starrcade set. Stupid. The Sgt Slaughter matches aren't that great either. I would've liked to see some matches when the sarge was a Iraqi sympathizer. Overall not a great release due to a poor selection of matches and an okay roundtable discussion. They should've had Arn Anderson as the other half of NWA/WCW representative instead of Mike Graham. He would've livened up the discussion with Flair stories and would've made this a better release. It's still good but could've been better.,1334620800,,1067,4.772972972972973
8336534,5,B001QVD0TK,"For those who don't already know, the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" program is a program on WWE 24/7 On Demand channel that's a roundtable discussion featuring Dusty Rhodes, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Michael Hayes, and Mike Graham speaking on various subjects. Throughout each discussion, you'll hear various personal & behind the scenes stories of each individual mentioned along with rare video highlights & pictures to showcase the point being put across. On each disc, you'll get a set of bonus matches with most of them never released on DVD before & even rare ones never seen on national television either...with Jesse Ventura's commentry not removed from the matches.

Flair's revolved around how he lived his gimmick, was able to make stars including a certain one that Michael Hayes himself said that he ""would never forgive Flair for"", the difference between himself & Hulk Hogan as the two dominate World Champions of the 1980's, along with stories about his history Dusty Rhodes & Dick Murdock. Sgt. Slaughter's discussion featured stories & discussions of how Pat Patterson brought him in, how great of a character & real man he is, the infamous ""Iraq"" heel run he had, the issues regarding his sudden WWE departure in 1984, and his importance as a backstage agent.

Matches Include:
Sgt. Slaughter vs. Mike Rotundo - A competitive match between these two that was good for what it was.
""Mid-Atlantic Wrestling"" May '82

Texas Death Match: Sgt. Slaughter vs. WWE Champion Bob Backlund - Tony Garea was the special referee for this ""no holds barred"" match.  This was a different type of match than expected from Backlund as he brawled on the outside early using things like the steps & ringpost on Slaughter.  Unfortunally after that, this was pretty ""tame"" for a Death match as it was a nice encounter but wasn't anything special past a normal wrestling match after the opening moments.
Sept. '83

Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik - This is nothing less than you would normally expect from a Sheik/Slaughter match as the crowd was absoutely crazy from start to finish as this match was just wild with both men taking the fight to each other nonstop throughout the match that always ended up just getting too out of control.
Apr. '84

Boot Camp Match: Sgt. Slaughter vs. Col. DeBeers - For those who don't know, a ""Boot Camp Match"" is just the military version of a street fight match.  It was a brawl with both men using various weapons like a combat weapon & riding crop while fighting in the ring & on the floor.  Various people got involved at times like ""Diamond"" Dallas Page, Iron Sheik, Adnan Al-Kaissie, and the Guerrero brothers resulting in Slaughter bleeding.  It was a nice match but again, a bit ""tame"" for the level of violence expected in this type of match.
AWA SuperClash III '88

NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Lex Luger - This had a special stipuation in that Flair would lose the belt if he got disqualified. I thought that this was possibly their most competitve match they've ever had as it wasn't the typical Luger/Flair match that involved a heavy amount of stalling & heel tactics as they went 30 mins. full of action here.
NWA Starrcade '88
(""Starrcade: The Essential Collection"")

Thunderdome Cage Match w/special referee Bruno Sammartino: Ric Flair & Sting w/Ole Anderson vs. Terry Funk & Great Muta w/Gary Hart - The rules for this match was that Ole Anderson or Gary Hart had to throw in the towel for their team for the match to end. This also used the Thundercage structure that was WCW's version of Hell In A Cell that not only covered the ring but the outside area as well. This match started out as a regular tag match but evolved into a four man brawl with each man using the cage at one point or another. Some ""highlight moments"" to look out for was Sting & Flair at various times using the rope that was the in the top corner of the cage to swing onto Terry Funk like ""Tarzan"" and Sting doing a huge leap splash from that same top corner of the cage all the way into the middle of the ring. The match was wild (the usual with Terry Funk matches) and truely one of the best matches held inside the Thundercage structure.
NWA Halloween Havoc '89

Ric Flair vs. Curt Hennig - This was a rare match as their more famous feud against each other happened two years earlier.  This was a good TV match as they did some nice wrestling in the ring & had an entertaining encounter on the outside as well.
""WCW Nitro"" Oct. '99

This is one of the disc in the collection that had a great overall discussion & valuable bonus matches in their own right...and on a personal note, ABOUT TIME they finally put the Thunderdome match on DVD!  Great disc for old school fans to check out.",1234224000,4,4702,4.633413461538462
