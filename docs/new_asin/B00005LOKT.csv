7944372,4,B00005LOKT,"WARNING:  This is not the Tylor that you're used to.  A lot of people in my anime club were lost by the OVA series.  It's focused heavily on the peripheral characters, the story does NOT go the direction that most of the TV series fans had hoped it would, and it is 100% serious.  The clever/silly humor from the TV series was dropped for a serious story line in the OVA.
Now that you have this warning, you're ready to approach these DVD's.  It's been a few years since I've seen the fan-subs of the Tylor OVAs, but the DVD quality will be far better than the 10th generation tapes that I have.  As I said above, the story is told in a different style from the TV series, but that doesn't mean that it's bad.  Taken on their own, I really enjoy them.  I just thought I should write this brief warning because, as I said, many fans of the TV series were very disappointed when the characters' motives and actions changed in the OVA.",993686400,14,932,4.255681818181818
