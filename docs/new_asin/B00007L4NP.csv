7977972,5,B00007L4NP,"A lot of DVDs featuring Klaus Kinski turn out disappointing to his true fans, but this one is a winner. KK gets tons of screen time and the story is fun to boot. Too bad about the dubbing of his voice but that can't be helped. I enjoyed the film and Mr. Kinski's performance. A worthy addition to your collection if you love Kinski.",1353801600,2,332,4.203125
7977973,5,B00007L4NP,"Both titles for this movie are incorrect. CREATURE WITH THE BLUE HAND was a title given to the movie by U.S.A. distributor Roger Corman and THE BLOODY DEAD is a later effort with poor new footage intigrated into the original footage, to be avoided at all costs.

The original title for this movie is simply THE BLUE HAND, directed by Alfred Vohrer and starring Harold Leipnitz, Klaus Kinski and Diana Korner. The official release date is 1967. It's about Klaus playing twin brothers, one, the elite Richard, baron of a gothic castle, and the other the deranged (or is he?) David, who is confined to an insane asylum for a murder which he suppossedly did not commit. David escapes (with mysterious help) and runs away into the night to his gothic home which appears to be about a mile or so from the asylum. Once there many hooded murders occur, committed by THE BLUE HAND and his razor sharp...well, you get the idea.

Is Klaus really guilty? Will the brothers be happy together? Will the Scotland Yard detective solve the mystery? Will Sir John get a new secretary? I hope not. She's HOT!!!

Lots of stuff going on here. Spooky gothic surroundings, twists and turns in a seemingly incoherent plot that only enhances the viewing enjoyment of this clever and witty German murder mystery.
A lot of the actors and the characters that they play reappear in director Vohrer's COLLEGE GIRL MURDERS which was made at around the same time and is also available on dvd. I SUPER-RECOMMEND that you pick it up as well. This is really great stuff from the 1960's, generally classified as GERMAN TRASH CINEMA, meaning ""pulp fiction"" cinema at it's best!

You've got a gothic castle, secret passageways, a demented doctor, a mysterious hooded killer, a butler that gives a great John Carridine performance, nice color, and a whacky mod score! A schlock fan's dream come true. But this film is no laughing matter, not in the Ed Wood fashion. It's played straight and it's pretty well done, a great example of 60's Euro pop culture & style. Highly recommended.",1334102400,10,2044,4.749295774647887

7977975,4,B00007L4NP,"Originally titled: THE BLUE HAND, this movie was brought to the states by Roger Corman and re-titled: CREATURE WITH THE BLUE HAND. Then, some genius' decided to shoot extra ""gore"" footage ten years after the movie was filmed, and rename it: THE BLOODY DEAD! These added scenes (a nurse being shredded by two mental patients) are pointless and silly. Thankfully, we get both THE BLOODY DEAD and the BLUE HAND as a double feature! The original has plenty of suspense, mystery, and fun without the unnecessary, tacked-on mess. We have Klaus Kinski in a dual role as twins, one a possible maniac! There's the title killer w/ his blue hand, complete w/ finger-knives! There's the insane asylum, the castle full of secret passages, and inhuman torture using both rats and snakes! Excuse me while I change my drool bucket! Yep, this one's a classic. Just ignore TBD and stick w/ the non-padded version...",1186444800,3,897,4.869281045751634
7977976,4,B00007L4NP,"This movie has been well reviewed here, but here are some additional points: 1) Klaus Kinski has some lengthy scenes early on in this film, and at the very end, which he handles very well. But Kinski's presence in this bizarre creation amounts to perhaps ten percent overall, and as always his voiced is dubbed.  2) The story may be based on an Edgar Wallace novel but the events portrayed in this movie never make any sense at any time. 3) Besides the extraneous footage mentioned, whenever the story threatens to become predictable or just plain stupid, the events portrayed always revert to the exceedingly bizarre.  4) I can't really say this is a ""good"" movie (even as a good bad movie) but the attempt to film a murder mystery with multiple twists to the plot becomes so tortured and incoherent that it is well worth seeing.",1184976000,4,830,4.639455782312925
7977977,4,B00007L4NP,"Creature with the Blue Hand was one of my favorite late night films from my childhood, but this video has added footage that was filmed much later by someone other than the films original crew. This detracts from the original body of work as it looks out of place and out of sync with the rest of the film. The dialogue and acting, not to mention the fact that the actors used for this additional footage look like they belong in the 80's and not the 60's, are truely laughable. it can be ignored and one shouldn't let it interfer with the enjoyment of the original work. This film was adapted from an Edgar Wallace mystery novel about twin brothers, one of whom has been committed to the local mental institution for committing murder. However, did they put the right brother in the asylum? This is a movie full of atmosphere and plot twists (more than most games of twister even). It was directed by Alfred Vohrer, who during the 60's directed many films based on the stories of Edgar Wallace. This, however, is one of his better efforts. If you are familiar with his films from this period of his work, you will recognize a great deal of the cast as having been in a number of his other films. Even though there was additional footage added, this film still holds up and is a great work in the German Krimi genre.",982800000,9,1316,4.419753086419753
7977978,4,B00007L4NP,This is a pretty good movie. It lagged at a few points but overall it was great. It was full of blood and gore but was much higher quality then most movies of this genre.(not that that would make any difference to me) It  also had a good story that  was more involved then most B Movies. Its  definitely worth checking out.,945907200,,323,4.17741935483871
7977979,4,B00007L4NP,"I bought this movie expecting it to be one of those films that are ""so bad they're good.""  In actuality, this is not a bad movie at all if you're into classic horror or weird suspense movies.  It has a great  story and better than average acting for this type of movie.  Here is my  list of pros and cons for this movie.  Pros: a great creepy old mansion,  an awesome mad Doctor, an unhealthy dose of blood and gore, a cool butler,  plenty of action, solid acting from all the main cast members, and a great  plot.  Cons: Although the overall story is logical from start to finish,  there are some details toward the end of the film that don't seem to make  sense.  I think this movie could have been a ""5"" if more  attention was paid to detail.",936835200,3,745,4.191489361702128
