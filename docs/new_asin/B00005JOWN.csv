1549292,2,B00005JOWN,"Two high points in this movie....the opening and the ending. Everything in between was weak. This was supposed to be a musical but the music doesn't move with the movie. Alot of the music just pops up for no other reason than to include a song but the song doesn't serve a narrative purpose its just there. Non of the music in the movie ever really gets ""poppin"" The song that you hear in the commercials and the trailers isn't even included in the movie but instead appears as a music video at the end of the movie during the credits. Which is really sad because its the best part of the movie. The Opening number with Macy Gray was a good way to begin the film but leaves you disappointed when you realize that thats as good as it gets until the end credits.

One major flaw in this movie...and as an OutKast fan I hate to say it was Big Boi. Compared to the rest of the cast his acting was weak and almost painful to watch. He got way too much screentime. Secondly, his musical numbers in the movie just don't belong there. 1930's prohibition era...why is he rapping? An idea that might work as a four-minute video on MTV seems out of place in a movie.

Visually the movie is solid. Some nicely choregraphed scenes and excellent cinematography but this to is misleading because it makes you think that at any minute you're going to see something ""Grand"" but it never comes. The movie advertises Ben Vereen and Patti Labelle like they are going to perform in the movie but they appear as extras. Simply put, this isn't the movie that they advertised. I wouldn't have a problem with it if I had gotten it free with CD but this was supposed to be a major theatrical release and it just doesn't cut it. Idlewild was advertised as ""Broadway"" but is more like a ""Jr. High recital""",1156723200,2,1777,4.365558912386707
1549293,3,B00005JOWN,"Wow this movie started with great promises.  The movie itself is entertaining to watch, the music is just fantastic, and the dance sequences are spot-on.  The costumes, digital effects and art direction are interesting and tasty.  I enjoyed seeing Andre move around the screen.  They have all of the elements here to make an outstanding, spectacular musical that could have put Chicago to shame.

But it didn't.

The problem lies in the script and director.  First of all, there were scenes that were simply out of order.  Characters had information before they should have.  Had they flipped the scenes around, it would have nudged closer to fulfilling its promises.  But there are some basic directing pitfalls from which a lot of new filmmakers suffer.  Not enough time passes.  Days lasted entirely too long.  Many individual scenes go on too long, thereby omitting the opportunity for a new scene that would have better developed the characters and plot.

There are some technical flaws as well.  There's a night scene early on that uses rack focusing to draw your attention between characters.  However there's one angle that has neither character in focus and jars you out of the scene.  There's a great profile master shot between Andre and Ben Vereen is overly backlit thereby washing out the characters.

And Ben Vereen is simply wasted in this movie.  He plays one note.  Had the script been allowed to breathe, they could have given him life and the opportunity to shine.  There's neither growth nor resolution with Ben.  In fact, most of the movie suffers from a lack of growth.

Terrence Howard gets off to a rocky start.  His character is far too stiff jawed.  By the end of the movie he finds his cool and salvages the role from its poor direction.

Antwan Patton dominates when performing, but he winds up a frustration in character development.  He meanders through the dramatic scenes lacking purpose.

There is nudity in the film that feels thrown into the mix for nudity's sake.  It felt gratuitous and unnecessary.

This is supposed to be a musical.  But the script doesn't take advantage of the musical numbers as a device to advance the story.  Yet the musical scenes that were included were so well done, so exciting, they left me wanting more.

It's a movie worth seeing, but put in the hands of a seasoned director, it could have been brilliant.",1156636800,2,2372,4.82089552238806
1549294,3,B00005JOWN,"A musical set in the Prohibition-era American South-- no way!
This is by far the worst movie I have seen since 'Better Luck Tomorrow' three years ago.  I have a scholarly explanation to support my reasons, but was not allowed to have it accepted.  Censorship is still alive and well in this country.

Today I went to see a movie I expected to showcase some jazz as it was touted as being a musical about the probition period. It was anything but jazz. About a piano-playing mortician who hauled around bootleg liquor in shiny wood caskets and Ace who dressed in overalls. All of their meetings were in that club where the dancing was amateurish and the music bad. There was language we don't normally hear and some nudity in the acts. It was so upsetting that I had to get up and leave.",1156550400,,786,4.444444444444445
1549295,4,B00005JOWN,"Had this movie sustained the cinematic brilliance of its first few minutes, there is no question that it would have been something so out of the ordinary as to become an instant classic. As it is, it may have some cross-and-jostle work to establish itself as one of the Movies of the Year to see, but its flashes of original genius strung together with an operatic plot and dynamic cinematography, make a necklace of great flash and fire. Surely this one, with its embarrassment of talent, will be mentioned in several categories, not only music, at Oscar time. Worth seeing--- absolutely. I can hardly wait for the DVD, so that I can watch its excess to excess.

The film is going to have a generational promotional gap, not just the much-discussed racial one. It can't be dismissed as ""the hip-hop Moulin Rouge"", as I heard one member of our preview audience critique it coming out of the theater. If she were old enough, she would know that it's more akin to a ""hip-hop Caberet"", with Rooster (Antwan Andre ""Big Boi"" Patton of Outkast) as Sally Bowles. Plot and camera work similarities to Moulin Rouge do not necessarily a ""Moulin Noir"" make, but yes, the similarities are there.

Let's don't go there. Let's talk about what's blazingly new and fresh about this musical. For people who ""hate musicals"", this one (as Cabaret did) solves the problem of two people in face-to-face dialogue embarrassingly and improbably breaking into song. The musical numbers are the entertainment at ""The Church"", a speakeasy in the South during Prohibition Era. Entertainment which is akin to Moulin Rouge's flamboyance, combining a jazz age lindy-hop with hip hop is dazzlingly choreographed by Tony Award winner Hinton Battle. While Macy Gray is wonderful as a hard-edged club singer, it is Rooster's first musical number at the Church, fusing jazz, cabaret and hip-hop, which blows the lid off.

OutKast fans (I count myself one) have to wait for plot development for the introverted Percival, played by Andre Benjamin, to display his musical talent. We are told it is there from the beginning of the movie, but it is not until he breaks out of his shell to coax the beautiful singer Angel Davenport (Paula Patton) to live her dream that he overcomes his stage fright and showcases his music. And there, ladies and gentlemen, is the centerpiece musical sparkler of this necklace, an impossible fusion number which turns sensational when
performed with confidence and style. Oh, my! What talent will do with notes on a page!

""The Church"", wryly named to showcase the corruption of bootleg liquor running, gambling and prostitution, is the hang-out for the dapper gangsta-land ""Spats"", Ving Rhames, who keeps the lid on violence in the ""Showtime at the Apollo"" club atmosphere and the dangerous business of squeezing both his booze supplier and the club owner, Sunshine Ace. We despise Ace more than anyone in the movie, until we get to know Trumpy (chillingly played by the gorgeous Terence Howard), who also comes out of his ""shell"" to reveal himself as a stupid and sadistic killer. The odd flatness of Howard's voice is powerfully used here to underscore his stupidity and the delight he has in killing people.

When greats like Ben Vereen and Cicely Tyson are little more than
cameos, you know you have talent to spare. My one concern is that the music style may be too much fusion to keep the hip-hop fans happy, and the movie may be too hip-hop to attract the general audience it deserves. The horrid truth is that I am a middle-aged white woman, one of the two demographic segments supposed to love musicals. But while my credibility is suspect, my general film-critiquing skills are generally pretty solid. Abandon your preconceptions and your prejudices, whatever they are, and Just Go See.",1156291200,41,3789,4.895638629283489

The originality of Outkast's music coupled with good acting and some all-stars to complete the ensemble like Terrence Howard and Ving R. The story takes any Outkast fan through a visual rendition of some of their best work, including songs from 'Speakerboxx/The Love Below'.

They had great chemistry in this movie, and I was looking forward to a happy-ever-after love story between their characters (Percival and Angel), until Angel was killed. That spoiled the whole movie for me. Also, I didn't like the ending of the movie. For me, at least, it didn't fit Percival's character at all. My favorite scene in the entire movie was when Angel was on stage and had lost confidence in her ability to sing, and Percival told her to only look at him and to sing to him. And MISS ANGEL sang the hell outta that song, ""Movin' Cool (The After Party)! It just angers me when two loving people finally find each other and inspire hope in each other, and then one ends up getting killed in the movie. A total let-down! Idlewild could have been a brilliant movie, with a great love story. I would be remiss if I forget to mention the powerful presence of the legendary Cecily Tyson in just one scene.

this film actually held the time period in place while adding and implimenting modern elements without losing any of the frame of reference, UNLIKE SO MANY OTHER 'FUSION' FILMS.  i'm not even considering this film in the same bracket as that other crap.  and this wasn't attempt to bring Broadway to the Silver Screen; this was a high concept story.  that's it.

Idlewild is a ""must see"" and ""must share"" film.  i'm disgusted by the lack of attention and credit that Idlewild has recieved.

AND BY THE WAY!  THERE'S SOME DAMN FINE ACTORS IN THIS FILM THAT DO A BANG-UP JOB...

The production numbers are quite simply unstoppable and the blending of the music of the period with the sensibilities of today works beautifully.  Obvious care was taken to recreate the look and feel of the period and some of the shots and film sequences, most notably a love scene and a death scene were simply mesmerizing.

I indeed admit that the script itself could have been more compelling but there is no denying the power of Andre Benjamin in this production.  His performance is measured, believable, poised, and poignant.  He has a more than promising future in films. Big Boi positively ooooooozes charm, has excellent comedic timing and hopefully we'll see more of him as well.

This is an excellent and a most worthy representation of another dimension/time in African-American culture and a MUST for your collection if you want quality productions of African-American life.

The purchase was justified, both albums are fantastic productions.  My pleasant surprise was that Idlewild uses great music from both halves of that double release.  Hard to believe such contemporary music could be blended so effectively into a story set during prohibition.  These guys are geniuses and have the knack for surrounding themselves with genius.  The film stands up as a great piece of entertainment. The acting, the music, the choreography, the cinemetography and editing - all great! Thanks Andre 3000 and Big Boi.

The plot was a clich, but the music and the acting were superb (the music was a few notches above the acting, but that's beside the point). Every song in this movie (except for one slow-moving one that's sung in the morticians' chamber) made me want to dance along (but I'm a bad dancer, so. . .). All the 30's dancing in this movie, especially during the end credits, were carefully & beautifully choreographed (mad props go to Hinton Battle). As for the acting, some performances were disappointing and 2-dimensional, like Paula Patton as Angel & Faizon Love as Ace, while others were brilliant and believable, like Terrence Howard as Trumpy and the incredible Ving Rhames as Spats.

In conclusion, I liked this movie. But I wouldn't recommend it to everybody. This is a movie not only for fans of Outkast, but also for fans of the old Speakeasy atmosphere.",1174089600,10,1002,4.597765363128492
1550649,4,B00005JOWN,"There's a funny thing about ""Idlewild"" that few movies can achieve: you know you've seen everything on screen here before, but the movie is filmed, and put together, with such gusto and energy that it's next to impossible not to like.

I would reiterate the plot for you, but I'm not exactly sure what it is. Rooster, played by Antwan ""Big Boi"" Patton, ""inherits"" a Depression-era speakeasy called Church and must deal with a ruthless gangster played by ""Hustle and Flow"" star Terrance Howard. Percivel, played by Andre ""Andre 3000"" Benjamin, is the son of a mortician who dreams of being a jazz composer who meets and falls for a mysterious woman who comes to sing in the speakeasy.

Or something like that.

""Idlewild"" has it's share of problems, that's for sure. The movie is twenty minutes too long and occasionally, mostly during the films final half an hour, gets bogged down in cliches and predicatability. Any moviegoer who has seen there fair share of movies can figure out what's going to happen to him and when about twenty minutes into the picture.

But you know what? Forget all that. ""Idlewild"" is a movie to be watched, not thought about, and sometimes that's okay. And you get a lot of good stuff to look at. Bryan Barber, who also wrote the script and has directed many OutKast videos as well, has an excellent eye for popping visuals, and he brings them all out here. The musical numbers are excellent and have an energy that is lacking from most movies. And I can honestly say that I have never seen a movie before that blends the French classic ""Amelie"", the old 1940's Warner Brothers film noir and gangster pictures and hip-hop music into one film before. And even if it doesn't all blend together flawlessly, you'd have to have a grey heart not to at least respect that.

The acting is pretty top notch as well. In addition to the always great Cicley Tyson and Ben Verren, both of whom are underused sadly, the film features some nice supporting turns, most notably from Ving Rhames, still the coolest actor on the planet not to get enought quality work. Newcomer Paula Patton, no relation to Antwan, is excellent in the role of love interst to Andre,  Big Boi and Andre both perform their roles well, Big Boi full of energy and swagger, Andre full some still motions as if he were sculpture coming to life. It's a performance that some have written off as dull, but is in fact more layered then it first appears.

Again ""Idlewild"" is flawed and isn't going to save the world or change your mind about anything. But I don't think it's trying to. Rather ""Idlewild"" just wants to entertain you for two hours and for the most part it does that in spades.

Well worth a rental.",1169164800,19,2696,4.590436590436591
1550720,3,B00005JOWN,"Boy oh boy I WANTED to love 'Idlewild'.I love OutKast and Andre 3000 and both do great things musically in this film. But....this film had so much promise and delivered so little. For sure 'Idlewild' is visually impressive and the dance numbers are all inventively choreographed. But my main criticism of this movie is the storyline. What could've been a great and empowering story about musical integrity and friendship denegrated into a cookie cutter gangster flick. And that happens a lot with movies from this period of time-it always seems that Hollywood has wanted to link the jazz age with crime. That rather links up to the other,and I feel the most significant flaw of this film-ANTWON PATTON!!!In the last several years I feel that Big Boi has been an extremely weak link in OutKast. In the beginning Big Boi and Dre were both Southern hip-hoppers of the finest degree but as Dre began to take on a more progressive,bohemian approch Big Boi went the other root. So now Andre 3000 has developed into a very unique (and apparently somehwat disliked) talent and Big Boi is little more then another in a glut of foul mouthed gangsta rappers with a scowl on his face (and besides isn't that whole gangsta thing a little old school now anyway?).And it's this gangsta/Big Boi persona that ruins the film. But as I've find most people equate Big Boi's general additude as being the building block of hip-hop so I think he is selling OutKast's records while Andre 3000 seems to be what links OutKast (and this movie) to artistic and critical acclaim. Besides Andre's links to his southern gentleman roots are very heavily explored in this movie and I think Big Boi could've done better had he followed a more creative vision then chasing the almighty dollar.

1550722,4,B00005JOWN,"IDLEWILD as conceived, created and directed by Bryan Barber is an all black cast version of the 1930s gangster/prohibition/big crime scene that bubbles over with energy and music and a lot of fun.  While the story is not unique by a long shot, the technique of making it comes alive with some of our most talented actors around.  Barber wisely incorporates hip hop music (a nod to his own career and talents of the two stars Andr Benjamin and Antwan A. 'Big Boi' Patton) resembles the way 'Moulin Rouge' was recently remade using contemporary music for a turn of the century story.  It works and polishes off a snappy evening of entertainment

The story is an old one: two young boys carry their friendship into adulthood, taking over their fathers' businesses (mortician and bootlegging) and encounter crime bosses, speakeasy snags in Idlewild, Georgia, snarls from wives and lovers, romance, loss of friends, surprise stardom, and learned lessons as they discover their own lives.  The cast is overflowing with talent: Ben Vereen, Ving Rhames, Terence Howard, Cicely Tyson, Macy Gray, Malinda Williams, Paula Jai Parker and the gorgeous Paula Patton, to name only a few of the cast of many.  The dance numbers are terrific, the music fits in well, and the exuberance displayed by the actors overcomes the rather weak standard of acting that Barber draws from these bonafide stars.

For a period piece from the 1930s pepped up with some truly fine choreography and musical numbers, this tasty little film is a winner.  Even the added cartooning for once complements the story.  It is a film well worth a visit!  Grady Harp, January 07",1168214400,,1635,4.912727272727273

Big Boi really shines in this one, and I always tended to favor Andre more. But scenes in this film, with Big Boi outrunning the gansters, and his smooth rap peppers the audio, to me is one of the finest moments in the film.

The love scene between Andre and Angel Davenport, when they meet each other in the rain, is beautifully shot.

The most compelling parts of the movie, as others have mentioned, are in the beginning, when the different musicians perform on stage @ the Church. Big Boi's rooster routine, with the camera flickering on the flawless crowd dancers, Macy Grays number, and Angie Davenport singing are the finest moments of the movie.

1550729,2,B00005JOWN,"Not being a rapper fan, I can't identify with those who have a love for Outkast, the musicians responsible for the soundtrack (and much of the acting) in IDLEWILD. I do, however, occasionally enjoy rap-related films; 8-Mile was interesting, and Hustle & Flow I rate as one of my favorite films of 2005. But the cohesiveness of music and story held those two together, while the mish-mash of modern sounds, modern dance moves, and modern lyrics, clashed with the prohibition era time-frame of Idlewild.

Although some of the music was toe-tappingly enjoyable, the blurring choreographed dances made the film very stilted. Rushing from movement to movement with no rhyme and very little reason, the dances held no appeal. The only plus was the very well designed sets and the excellent period costumes.

The acting was also extremely sub-par when comparing Idlewild to other films of this genre (most notably Moulin Rouge and Chicago). Although these two films were more white-washed (i.e., had more Caucasians than black folks), their even-handedness when it came to telling the story through characters and their songs held truer. Part of Idlewild's problem obviously had to do with the main character, Percival.

Percival is played by Outkast member Andre Benjamin (Four Brothers). Although Benjamin is building his cinema repertoire, his acting skills often fall flat in Idlewild. His relationship with his father (legendary dance master Ben Vereen) is uninteresting and forced. Even his relationship with his best friend Rooster (Big Boi, another Outkast singer) feels unnatural from beginning to end. And Percival's love interest Angel (Paula Patton, Deja Vu) is believably drawn into their blossoming relationship, while Percival himself again seems detached and disinterested. I think this is proof positive that good rappers do not necessarily make good actors. The exception to the acting was - no surprise - Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow). Playing bad guy Trumpy, Howard oozed depravity in nearly every scene; a shining light surrounded by dreary performances.

No musical film review would be complete without mention of the music itself, too. As stated at the beginning, I have no previous knowledge of Outkast or their musical style. In fact, I'd never even heard of them prior to watching this, so I come into it fresh and without a sense of connection to the artists. That said, I don't think I could listen to Outkast too long without going a bit bonkers. Their style is too disjointed and swings about in a very A-D-D fashion. Maybe it's a sign of the times. Or maybe I'm just getting too old for this style. But I hesitate to label myself as an old sour-puss. I enjoyed Hustle & Flow so much that I bought the DVD and the soundtrack. Perhaps there is a bridge to be found between modern musicians and the aging baby-boomer like myself. Unfortunately, Idlewild ain't it.",1166054400,6,2887,5.0588235294117645

1550820,4,B00005JOWN,"Since Run-DMC's TOUGHER THAN LEATHER, rap artists have been making attempts to merge their creative vision with cinema.  At their best, you get 8 Mile (or even House Party).  But generally. low budgets and lack of vision have churned out tons of vanity driven schlock that fans gobble up like candy but don't have any lasting value.

Written and directed by Music Video master Bryan Barber, Idlewild is, hands down, the most visually adventurous African-American film of the decade. For those unfamiliar with the Atlanta rap group OutKast, they've spent the last decade making Black Music that exists completely ""out of the box"" but is still funky. In the past few years they've scored massive radio hits with ""BOB,"" ""Miss Jackson,"" ""The Way You Move,"" and ""Hey Ya,"" with memorable videos for all.

Members Andre Benjamin (Four Brothers) and Big Boi (ATL) have appeared in films before, but this is the first one that exists entirely as a reflection of their imagination. In their first movie together, they deliver a gangster film/ hip-hop musical set in the prohibition-era that features an amazing supporting cast, fantastic costumes and dance numbers (by Hinton Battle) and some pretty good music. Idlewild captures the past, present and future of Black Culture in one film.

Both stars and the supporting cast seem to be having fun with their roles.  Terrence Howard steals every scene he's in.  Bobb'e J. Thompson, as the 10 year-old Big Boi is a find as is Paula Patton, an ingnue to be sure, but could be the next Halle, especially after her co-starring turn in DeJa Vu.

The minuses:  We don't get a chance to see Dre and Big Boi perform together onscreen. One of the songs, She Lives In My Lap, is recycled from Speakerboxx/Love Below and used in a very dark and morbid scenario.  Barber's plot runs out of steam long before the running time ends and Patti LaBelle is all but wasted in a non-singing cameo.

True OutKast fans have already added this to their shopping cart.  This may not be a ""must own"" for the uninitiated, but Idlewild will prove to be an important film in the new Black Film Revolution because it shows what film and hip-hop look like when they meet at their highest possible level.",1165190400,,2212,4.776902887139108
1550821,3,B00005JOWN,"Set in the American South during the prohibition of the early 1900's, ""Idlewild"" produces a fairly refreshing look at the era by utilizing talented young musicians and actors to produce a musical that can appeal to a younger generation.

The cinematography was imaginative and innovative. The big shoot-out scene at the end was astounding, and well worth an award of some kind. The music and choreography are incredible, and illustrate the film's tone and mood beautifully.

A negative to this film would be it's inherent predictability, and it's tendency to rely too heavily on cliche characters and storylines. This film tells the tale of two brothers/friends, one is a quiet and straight-laced musician, and the other a speakeasy nightclub owner who is more prone to bad boy tendencies and drawn to the darker side of the human nature. Together they run into all kinds of trouble, inlcuding murder and the mob. The ending is predictable, and can be seen a mile away. However, there's no reason not to watch this film simply to enjoy the music and stylistic nature of it.

However, I always appreciated their videos because they weren't typical and very creative. I believe that people who aren't that fond of contemporary rap will love this movie.

It obviously that these young men have knowledge of their people's history and incorporated it.  They are not your typical rappers.  If you expected them to be clowning and wearing outrageous outfits and all, then disappointment would be inevitable. The men and the women generally where classically dressed.  They reminded me of old pictures of my grandparent during their youth.  They were dressed to the nines.

In addition, I suspect some fans didn't like it because it did not cater to sterotypes.  This is the reason I love it.  Their is no cooning and buffoning here. Sorry y'all.  Please turn on MTV and BET for that.

The cinematography was so freakin' excellent.  Andre Benjamin is absolutely not a singer and his acting skills are something to be desired, yet I still love him in the movie.

Big Boi was a suprise to me.  He is usually in the background and doesn't get the play that Andre gets.  He is a pretty good actor, and I can see him doing big things that have nothing to do with rapping.  Both of these young men are very talanted in their own individual ways.

I suggest y'all look at some classic African American films.  I loved the ending with the tap dancing.  I almost jumped up and shouted.  I felt the spirit tryin' to creep on me.

Nothing in this world is new.  If you want to see where they lifted the idea for the tap dancing scene, check out the movie Stormy Weather with the Nicholas Brothers, starring Lena Horne.

This movie did not get its just deserts, butI feel that it will be a classic.  I think folks over 30 and don't care for rap generally will appreicate a movie like this.  I really think more mature audiences will appreciate this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and as far it being cliche and predictable, in my opinion 90% of commericially released films fits this category - boring, uninspiring and cliche. I rarely go to the theatre because I feel that most movies released aren't worth the time, money or effort to get to the theatre.

1550825,4,B00005JOWN,"""Idlewild"" is a very creative musical movie, cleverly balancing the look of a straight-laced period piece with the style and fierceness of a present day crowd pleaser. While the story is based in 1935--specifically in a rural Georgia town called Idlewild--the freewheeling visuals, imaginative dialogue, and modern music (courtesy of Outkast) make it difficult to get completely absorbed in pure nostalgia. This is despite the bold costume and set designs, both of which are more or less authentic to the time period. But from the audience's perspective, that doesn't matter; it was a fun and fascinating reinterpretation, the likes of which haven't been seen since Baz Luhrman's ""Moulin Rouge.""

Truth be told, both films are similar in several ways, aside from their playful manipulations of era and music. For one, each film includes a love story, one that meets several obstacles along the way. Also, the heroes of both stories are young artists trying to find their way in the world. Most importantly, both use the genres of comedy and tragedy to convey a relatively simple message. To some, these conventional storytelling methods may hurt ""Idlewild"" more than they help. The plot is incredibly predictable, having been used many more times that anyone would care to count. However, the film's look and music are quite original, and it makes for a film that's so interesting to watch, the formulaic plot can easily be overlooked. It has a special kind of quality to it, the kind that can suck you in and leave you eager to see how everything unfolds.

The film is narrated by Percival Jenkins (Andre Benjamin), a young man with aspirations of becoming a songwriter. By day, he lives a humdrum life as an assistant mortician for his father's funeral home. By night, he plays gigs at a nightclub called Church, a swinging joint overflowing with bootlegged alcohol and scantily clad showgirls. While Percival pounds away on the piano, his lifelong friend, Rooster (Antwan A. Patton, also known as Big Boi), performs rap solos to a roomful of dancing customers. Almost every musical number located within Church is a highly choreographed, frenetic showstopper, each cut lightening quick, each shot loose and untamed. When combined with a hip-hop soundtrack, they make for some rather unique sequences that I couldn't take my eyes off of.

At times it gets a little too distracting, which is problematic considering there's so much more to the story. There are actually two distinct storylines, both of which are simple enough to allow for minimal confusion. The first story specifically relates to Percival. He meets Angel Davenport (Paula Patton), a seductive singer from St. Louis who hopes to kick-start her career in Idlewild before moving to Chicago. As the film progresses, she simultaneously tries to win the affections of both the Church staff and Percival, the latter of which is proving much easier to accomplish. There's no doubt he finds her beautiful, but more importantly, he seems genuinely interested in helping her become successful. What he has yet to realize is just how insecure she is with herself and how much help she needs in finding the courage to follow her dream.

Unfortunately, this interaction is only worsening the conflict between him and his father, Percival, Sr. (Ben Vereen). He's an extremely distant man who has yet to accept the death of his wife. Because of that, he barely speaks to his son, save some moments of work-related dialogue (most of which involve scolding over improper behavior). What's worse is that he sees Angel as nothing more than a floozy who'll leave his son the first chance she gets. All this gives Percival, Jr. quite a bit to think about: does he want to spend the rest of his life as a mortician, or does he want to have a future with Angel in Chicago? He's known since he was a child that his true love was music; early on in the film, we see him as a child practicing the piano (initially forced on him by his strict aunt). When he looks at a sheet of music, he sees it very differently than the way other musicians do: to him, the notes are living cartoon characters wreaking havoc on the page. It may be a bizarre method of visualization, but it enables him to play with greater passion than just studying the melody.

The other side of the story specifically relates to Rooster. From a very early age, he had a natural propensity towards number crunching, and it enabled him to make some shrewd ""business"" deals as he grew. Now as an adult, he's the womanizing main attraction of Church. He's also very close with a crime boss known only as Spats (Ving Rhames), the man responsible for supplying the club with booze. At one point, Spats proposes a business deal that doesn't sit well with his right hand man, Trumpy (Terrence Howard). Rather than lose the chance at greedily snatching up extra money, the power-hungry Trumpy takes matters into his own hands.

It's an act that turns Rooster's world upside down, forcing him to become the new manager of Church (all he can rely on for words of wisdom is a flask with a talking rooster emblem). It's a tense situation, especially since a lot of illicit debts need to be repaid. At this point in the film, Trumpy goes from a quiet skeptic to an immature bully, an expected personality shift in stories with villains. His new position becomes a means of intimidation over Rooster, who tries to reason that debt can only be paid so quickly. But as Trumpy is quick to point out, ""When you inherit a club, you inherit the debt.""

How fortuitous that should be said, especially since Rooster's business troubles are second only to the strained relationship with his wife, Zora (Malinda Williams), and his children. When it comes to them, he's emotionally in debt, and what he owes Zora is much more valuable than the money he owes Trumpy. She tries her hardest to look past her husband's faults, but as he spends more and more time in Church, it becomes less and less possible for her to do so. Ultimately, Rooster must decide if he wants a life of wealth or a life of happiness (in this case, they're not one and the same; the proof is in an especially touching scene featuring an impoverished family living in their car).

As you might expect, the two separate narratives come together during the final scenes. The ultimate outcome is more than a little cliche, as are a lot of the other structural elements of the film. But oddly enough, it didn't bother me that much; if anything, the fact that the film was so highly stylized allowed me to view it less critically. It's modern hip-hop soundtrack and elaborate digital effects were too unique to allow me to dismiss this film. Despite a worn story, it's not a rehash; it's a fun, entertaining musical, filled with convincing drama, tense conflict, and some decent humorous moments. For good measure, the filmmakers even included a couple of memorable cameos, including Patti LaBelle, Macy Gray, and Cicely Tyson. What a fitting way to cap off ""Idlewild""; it's a truly imaginative film that captures the spirit of classic musicals while being fresh enough for today's audiences.",1157241600,2,7144,4.82137030995106
1550826,3,B00005JOWN,"""The A's"" dynamic duo strikes again. This time not in record sales, but with their big screen debut Idlewild (Universal Pictures). With the help writer and director Bryan Barner, once again Outkast takes you on a magical ride, this time to Idlewild, GA where two small town friends get caught up in big time gangsta drama. Idlewild tells the tales of gangstas and hustlers in a creative, corky way.

Andre Benjamin and Antwan Patton do not give overly impressive acting performances simply because their characters Percival and Rooster, respectively, are not a far stretch from the Andre 3000 and Big Boi you all know as Outkast. However, a stellar cast with the likes of Ben Vereen, Cicely Tyson, Ving Rhames, and Terrence Howard make Idlewild worthy of any Hollywood accolades it may receive.

The compelling and layered storylines keep the audiences attention throughout the film. Percival, an unpopular, timid musician finds a love who encourages him to reach his true potential and follow his dreams. Rooster, the outgoing, street smart performer who looks out for Percival, maneuvers through grimy gangsta politics while trying to maintain a stable family structure.

Bryan Barber, the mastermind behind many Outkast videos including the award winning ""Hey Ya"" pushes the visual envelope with captivating ""church"" (the club in the movie) scenes. Outkast favorites like ""Bowtie"" and ""Church"" are performed with uptempo swing choreography from Tony winner Hinton Battle and touched with subtle ATL flava reminiscent of the the ""The Way You Move"" video. Throughout the film, fast paced scenes are contrasted by slow motion isolation which takes the cinematography to a level in line with the box creativity of Outkast themselves.

Unfortunately for viewers that are not die hard Outkast fans, the musical performances may seem a bit corny at times. These musical elements, which serve as the soundtrack and upcoming Outkast album, are edited brilliantly between scenes which only add to the dramatic storyline. A steamy sex scene between Percival (Andre) and his romantic interest Angel (Paula Patton) more than make up for any disappointments-an added treat Andre 3000 groupies are sure to enjoy.

Overall, Idlewild is an entertaining musical told in a bizarre fashion that only Outkast could manage to pull off.",1156982400,,2316,5.265582655826559
1550827,5,B00005JOWN,"I just came from seeing this movie and I was blown away!  I am a die hard Outkast fan and seeing this movie has given me more of an appreciation for the group and their talents.  I thought the movie was artistic and entertaining.

Idlewild is not a typical film, nor is it a musical.  It is a story of many different components brought together to make a masterpiece.  Andre Patton has a family but struggles with infidelity and new responsibility; while Andre Benjamin finally finds love and then loses it.  Terrence Howard is the hard nose he usually is and the other characters were just as valuable.

I am impressed by the movie and I encourage everyone to see it for themselves.  It seems that some of the negative comments are simply due to not understanding the basis of the film and the background of that particular era for a black man.  Perhaps too much has been read into the film and they should have taken the time to enjoy it instead of analyzing it.",1156896000,,964,4.431818181818182
1550828,3,B00005JOWN,"""Idlewild"", the new musical featuring Andre Benjamin and Antwan Patton, both members of the musical group OutKast, is a mess. This is both a compliment and a criticism. The result is a wildly uneven film filled with bland performances and a very unique, interesting visual appeal.

Georgia. The Prohibition Era. Percival (Andre Benjamin, ""Four Brothers"") works at his father's (Ben Vereen) funeral home during the day, slowly taking over all responsibilities as his dad boozes the day away. At night, he sings at a local speakeasy called Church, which is run by Ace (Faizon Love). His lifelong friend, Rooster (Antwan Patton), also sings at the club, but runs his former mentor's (Ving Rhames) illegal activities during the day. Every night, his wife drops him off at the club complaining that he isn't spending enough time at home, with their five kids. One day, Trumpy (Terrence Howard), a local gangster who also runs booze, has a fight with Ace and before he knows it, Rooster is in charge of Church. Adding the stress of running the club isn't easy and Rooster doesn't like paying Trumpy's increased charges for booze. As Rooster looks for a new source of booze, Percival falls in love with Angel (Paula Patton), a beautiful new singer, who has dreams of going to Chicago to make it big.

""Idlewild"", directed by Bryan Barber, probably would not have been made without the success of ""Moulin Rouge"" a few years ago. The two films share many characteristics. Like its predecessor, ""Idlewild"" exhibits a frantic sense of editing; the musical numbers more closely resemble music videos, with most cuts lasting just a few frames. This isn't surprising given the background of the director and his two stars. Both films also use contemporary music in a historical context providing each with an undeniable energy and appeal.

Barber is clearly more comfortable with the visual than the dramatic. From the moment the film begins, as we watch an old phonograph start playing a record, the director uses a blend of animation, live action, graphics and music to depict the fast moving story of the two friends during the Prohibition Era. As the record begins playing, the camera swoops up to a series of old photographs, slowing dissolving between them. But then, a figure in each begins to move a little, growing slightly, and these photos help to establish the setting and the tone of the story. As we flip through these photos, color begins to dissolve into an old photo and we watch as the film starts and the characters are introduced. Barber returns to this technique, in modified ways, throughout, providing a unique transitional device.

There is also the unusual addition of a talking flask. Rooster inherits the item from his mentor (Rhames) and frequently looks at it. As he looks at it, the rooster in the logo on the silver vessel comes to life, talking to him, providing a sort of Greek chorus. This idea doesn't really gel and seems to be a distraction.

The musical numbers have a unique energy, a lot of which comes from the fast-paced editing style. This technique adds interest to this portion of the film, but they also help to cover up any inconsistencies in the song or choreography. Strangely, Benjamin and Patton almost never sing together in the film and the songs suffer because of it. Early, Benjamin sings a song which we can barely hear over the din in the club. Later, Patton does a song, rapping through the lyrics as showgirls dance around him. This song is better, but the choreography seems a little stiff. But because of the editing, many of these flaws are covered up. We simply don't have time to concentrate on any one aspect for long. However, we can hear the song better and the two singers alone are not nearly as dynamic as they are when paired. Late in the film, Benjamin sings a song which is very reminiscent of Cab Calloway (one of Percival's idols) and seems clearly influenced by Busby Berkeley. Everyone is dressed in white, moving around white pianos in front of a shiny black backdrop. It is an interesting attempt to recreate the look and feel of a bygone era.

The filmmaker and stars deserve a lot of credit for not taking the easy route. Instead of telling a modern day story, they attempt a period piece and the attention to detail is impressive. Dialogue, production design and costumes all appear authentic and the only time the period is lost is during the songs. It had to be a difficult sell to get a studio to make this film. Imagine how much easier it would've been to make a modern day tale featuring the popular group's music. The studio probably would've preferred it, but by taking this more challenging approach, the film becomes more memorable. It still isn't perfect, but it is fun to watch.

Movies featuring singers are often problematic. They are trained for different things and are not always able to make the transition to the big screen. Of the two, Benjamin has an undeniable screen charisma. In his previous film, John Singleton's ""Four Brothers"", he worked with a seasoned director and turned in an interesting, believable debut performance. His work in ""Idlewild"" is good, but bland. He almost never changes his facial expression through good and bad. He clearly needs a more seasoned director to guide him to an interesting, believable performance. Patton is more effective trying to display varying emotions, but his delivery is as bland as Benjamin's performance. His voice never changes volume, so everything coming out of his mouth (including lyrics) becomes a monotone that fails to reach any highs or lows.

Terrence Howard turns in his least interesting work to date. It is odd to me that he would take such a small, supporting role, after his work in ""Hustle and Flow"" and ""Crash"". He is essentially playing the same character he played in ""Four Brothers"", but in a different era, and both characters are uninteresting and stereotypical. We have seen corrupt cops and gangsters before, so if an actor with the skill of Howard is going to take on such a role, he should bring something new to it. In ""Idlewild"", he seems to play a stock gangster. There is little, if anything, to make this character memorable.

The supporting cast is impressive, but many of these actors appear for brief glorified cameos. Ben Vereen, Cicely Tyson, Macy Gray, Ving Rhames, Patti LaBelle all pop up, but they are rarely given the chance to add anything to the film musically. What a disappointment.

Barber is clearly comfortable with the visual aspects of the filmmaking process. Hopefully, he will soon be able to match those talents with improved skills in storytelling. When this happens, we might have a filmmaker who creates some memorable escapes. Until that point, his efforts will be very hit and miss.",1156809600,9,6779,4.841242450388266
