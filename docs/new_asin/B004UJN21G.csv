4467368,5,B004UJN21G,"Set in Siam early 18th century this film sets the stage for the real crowd winner, [KINGDOM OF WART 2.] It brings you in close to all the main character and makes you part of their future.

It also shows how one man bent on domination and control can determine the lives of generation after generation of people who are subject to his rule.

watch KOW 1. Then watch the KOW 2. you'll be glad you did.",1311292800,7,400,4.181818181818182
4467369,4,B004UJN21G,Complicated in the storyline but visually grand and on a scale that is difficult for Hollywood to emulate in modern times.,1437782400,,122,4.857142857142857
4467370,5,B004UJN21G,"It's very entertaining.  I'm not sure of the history presented so can't comment on the accuracy of that.  There are some anachranisms in the film as far as the guns in use are Flintlocks which hadn't been invented in the 16th century.  I suppose it can be overlooked if we aren't holding the producers to total historical accuracy in a drama.
The subtitles appear to be correct and make sense, not only grammatically, but also in context to what is happening on screen.  The translation doesn't appear to be direct word for word, but a contextual meaning conveyed, as in colloquialisms and slang are given English equivalents rather than literal translations which don't make sense in English.",1425945600,,693,4.897435897435898

4467374,4,B004UJN21G,"If you are looking for blood ,war ,and brutality ,this has it in abundance. It is an ambitious and revealing movie set in Siam,where the lavish and exotic scenes are a treat for the eyes.
The story centers around the ruling lord's young child in a defeated providence. He is taken as hostage,far from his homeland,and raised as an adopted son by the conquering Burmese king,who intuitively recognized his great potential. This,however,does nothing for the relationship with the kings jealous and reckless blood sons. While making loyal friends in a hostile environment,the child is sent to the temple for his protection, where he is taught by a sympathetic monk. Amid the intrigue,where family members are used like pawns in a game of chess,he enhances his already formidable nature and develops into a true and capable leader.
This is a well presented and riveting tale,although,perhaps,too intense and violent for young audiences. In my opinion,the factor that makes this movie above the average is it's cultural perspective and extraordinary visual spectacles.",1371600000,3,1063,5.295857988165681
4467375,5,B004UJN21G,Great story about Siam and surrounding countries. Got to pay attention movie moves fast. Highly recommend this movie if u r interested in Asian culture,1368489600,,151,5.08

4467377,1,B004UJN21G,Aside from the annoyance of having to read a two hour movie KOW Part 1 adds injury to insult by being poorly acted and the music is totally annoying.,1351209600,,149,4.172413793103448
4467378,5,B004UJN21G,"Beautiful costumes with great insight into the history of Thailand and its old kingdoms.  Great story on ethics and the traditions of kings.  This movie helped me better understand the movie/play of ""The King and I.""  I never really appreciated Thailand because I never knew it as a beautiful and historic nation.  This movie made me want to visit Thailand.  This is the first out of three movies.  According to Wikepedia, this movie came out in 2003, the 2nd in 2007 (just as good) and the 3rd was released in 2011.  This series of movies were the most expensive movie Thailand has ever made, and one can see why being that there are so many extras used in the series.  The first movie is about the main character's childhood as a hostaged prince and student of ethics.  Though this is a long movie, you will want to watch the second one by the end of the first.  The second movie is more epic and demonstrates the prince as an adult warrior.",1343433600,10,943,4.461988304093567

8441622,5,B004UJN21G,I somehow found Kingdom of War Part I and Part II after watching Ong Bak II and III.  I don't know if the later wetted my appetite for the former but the story of Prince Naresuan's early life kept my interest for the almost 3 hours of this film as well as a similar amount of time in Part II.,1475539200,,292,3.8666666666666667
