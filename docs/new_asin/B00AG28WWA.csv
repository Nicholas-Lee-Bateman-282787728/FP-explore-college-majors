8551184,5,B00AG28WWA,"I really enjoy Vocaloid Music so I decided to get this so I can learn how to dance the routines,this did not disappoint. The DVD focus on one song called ""Happy Synthesizer"" and it gives you the whole dance routine,step by step,part by part. The instructions are in Japanese but since it's dancing you only need to worry about actually learning the moves instead of what they're saying. The menu section is easy to guide through. The other two songs in the DVD called are Heart Beats(New Remix) and Shake It!,but they are only Music Videos(no dance lesson) but are still fun to dance to. As for ""Happy Synthesizer"" there is a section where you can pick the song at 3 different angles,Front,Back,and Side so you can see how it looks from all angles to practice with. The DVD also comes with a CD with the 3 tracks.",1420934400,4,813,4.5
