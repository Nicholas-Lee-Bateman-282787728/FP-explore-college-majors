6126785,5,B00H2FEXXG,It was a great movie for us runners who run 26.2 miles it prepares you for what is ahead in marathon,1394150400,,100,3.8095238095238093
6126786,5,B00H2FEXXG,"I'm happy for the fast delievry and i advise you to see this video
That a so nice video ! You have to see that !!!",1393891200,,114,3.423076923076923
6126787,2,B00H2FEXXG,"I was really excited to get my hands on Spirit of the Marathon 2 because I loved the original.  I have probably watched the original 10 times and it gets me emotional every time.  When I am feeling really unmotivated I will pop it in the dvd player and get a re-charge.

Sadly the 2nd edition of Spirit of the Marathon is not very good.  I did not feel much of a connection to any of the runners and some of their stories felt forced.  That is not to say that the stories were untrue...just that I didn't feel a lot of emotion behind them.  The runners that were being followed were genuinely not interesting and a couple of them were actually annoying to me.  This movie tried to push a couple emotional issues with a few of the runners that I really didn't feel had any impact on their story...it felt like the director was digging for some underlying reason for them to run a marathon.

Furthermore, and I guess it comes with documenting a marathon in Italy, but the fact that I had to read english sub-titles for all but one of the runners was kind of obnoxious.  The only part that was even remotely emotional was when the Italian lady crosses and the camera shows her son with tears in his eyes.

Two words...Complete Letdown!",1393286400,9,1232,4.364035087719298
6126788,5,B00H2FEXXG,"Both Spirit of the Marathon I and II have different styles.
I found that I like them both.
First Spiirt of the Marathon moves me emotionally at the end.
The second one moves me up and down throughout the entire movie and less at the end.

6126818,5,B00H2FEXXG,It isn't necessary to compare it to the first movie. This one stands by itself. The lives and struggles of some marathoners from different nationalities with the beautiful background of the eternal city of Rome...,1463443200,,213,5.114285714285714

6126825,2,B00H2FEXXG,"Doesn't come close to the original.  This one feels as if the director took a fomulaic approach and threw interviews clips over nondescript ""inspirational"" music and thought that would work.  It lacks the art of storytelling and emotion of the first.  I would not recommend spending the time or money.  Disappointing.",1460246400,,317,5.1568627450980395

6126850,3,B00H2FEXXG,"The personal stories are inspirational and motivating which helps to maintain training for the longer events, especially the full marathons.  I found this movie more difficult to watch compared to the first Spirit of the Marathon primarily due to the language issues and the use of subtitles.  While I appreciate using the runner's native language, for me it interrupts the flow.",1444694400,,379,5.19672131147541

6126853,2,B00H2FEXXG,"The manic mrs robinson type ruined the entire film. I was so distracted by her blatant attention seeking behavior that there was no enjoying the movie. The fact that she's doing so under the guise of raising money for cancer research is shameful. Please explain how drawing attention to yourself by running 52 marathons in 52 weeks remotely helps with fundraising...? She is nothing more than a vapid middle aged woo girl acting like a 25 yr old, and it's sincerely sad. I only watched this because the original Spirit of the Marathon is not available anywhere, and this was a disappointment.",1444435200,4,592,4.813725490196078
6126854,5,B00H2FEXXG,Loved The Spirit of the Marathon and this is a worthy follow-up.,1444176000,,64,4.416666666666667

6126857,3,B00H2FEXXG,"I was hoping that this sequel matched the intensity and excitement of the ""Spirit of the Marathon,"" but, alas, it was not to be. Disappointed in this sequel for several reasons: the cast of characters did not engender the kind of emotional support that the first cast did, the stories were not woven as well as in the first movie, and the excitement that was palpable in the first movie was simply missing in this one. It's certainly not a ""bad"" movie, but not as thrilling as the first.",1422835200,3,487,4.48314606741573
6126858,3,B00H2FEXXG,"This movie was set up differently than the first, and subjectively I believe the organization was worse. The race itself starts the movie, and the training and backstories are shared within the context of the marathon. This is a cool choice because it captures the ""wow this is really long"" feeling that a marathon race provides. For the second movie, they also chose not to play music when sharing film of the runners during the race itself, and the sound of thousands of feet moving really captures the soundtrack of a true race, which was better than the majestic and exciting movie soundtrack of the first film.

The multiple languages and subtitles may turn off some audiences. Also, by racing throughout, there wasn't the same emphasis on the training, which is a huge part of running marathons. The first Spirit of the Marathon is among my favorite movies ever because it chronologically captures the process of training for, and running a marathon. By the time the race starts, the audience feels like they're on the starting line with the runners. This movie captured the experience of the marathon itself better than the first movie, but I think the first film captured what it means to live the lifestyle of a marathoner.",1420675200,2,1232,4.838862559241706
6126859,4,B00H2FEXXG,Just as what I expected it to be. But shipping took really long to reach.,1410134400,,73,3.933333333333333

6126862,5,B00H2FEXXG,Great inspiration for running and showing the heart and soul of runners.  Wonderful views of a large destination marathon.  You will enjoy it..,1402012800,,143,5.173913043478261
6126863,5,B00H2FEXXG,"Great movie shows how a group of people train for  a marathon. It gives you a  look at the daily lives, their struggles and their victories.",1398556800,,140,4.346153846153846
6126864,5,B00H2FEXXG,"Although not as well done as the original (and hey, most sequels aren't) it was a great inspirational running documentary. They really tried too hard I think to give it some international flair. It was the stories of the individuals that carried it, the verbal and non-verbal moments of struggle and raw emotion that made this movie (and any other such movie). I especially felt for the guy who lost his son to drug abuse, and was impressed by owner of the pizza parlor for just showing all of us what is possible at any age.

The inclusion of running history narrated by accomplished runners was kept as part of the formula, and it worked well here as it did in the previous movie. If you're planning on running a marathon, or just want to understand someone you know who is running a marathon, it's money well spent.",1397865600,6,818,4.527027027027027

6126866,5,B00H2FEXXG,Excellent!  Really inspiring and just as great as the original movie.  I wanted to run a marathon as soon as I finished watching it.,1395792000,,132,4.458333333333333

6126868,4,B00H2FEXXG,"Set in Rome, this is an enlightening look into the lives of amateurs and elite runners and their trials and tribulations while preparing for  a marathon and while running one.

6126869,5,B00H2FEXXG,"Touching, interweaving stories and very good photography of the Rome marathon that really captures the essence of marathon running and the community that exists around those races.

6126871,3,B00H2FEXXG,"The original had a cohesive timeline, sparse subtitles, and excellent characters. Unfortunately, instead of using a linear story line, the movie is too segmented to create either tension or empathy for the featured runners. Too many foreign speakers means a lot of subtitles, which really distract from the beautiful scenery. I've watched the original many times, and will continue to watch it over and over. This one is pretty much a one and done.",1394496000,7,448,5.0675675675675675

8629222,5,B00H2FEXXG,"This brings back so many of my memories of when I was running, and running marathons.  These people endure the pain, but in the end they gain so much from the experience.  I know I did.  I started my running back in the early 1970's when there were very few runners.  We were an anomaly that most people just didn't understand.  I'm so happy the sport has become a much better understood activity, and that so many people engage in it, both actively, and in support.  I ran over 40 marathons in my running career.  I figured that due to health problems I would never run again, but this film, and many others like it, inspire me to try to resume the sport I love.  Thanks for the wonderful film.
