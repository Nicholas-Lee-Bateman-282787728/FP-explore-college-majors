8037329,5,B00062IZRM,"there was not one episode that had to do with christmas, holidays, etc. the episodes were hello kitty in wonderland, adventure in a carrot patch...  NONE were holiday. i'm pretty pissed since all the other reviews mention santa episodes and such. the DVDs looked as if they were pirate copies. i'd really like my $14 back please for false advertising.
UPDATE: IN TEENIE TINY WRITING ON THE MIDDLE OF EACH DVD IS MARKED ""SIDE A"" AND ""SIDE B"". SWITCHED SIDES, LOW AND BEHOLD THE CHRISTMAS EPISODES. WILL NOT RETURN.",1473206400,,513,4.764044943820225

8037334,3,B00062IZRM,"My 5 year old specifically requested a Hello Kitty Christmas DVD.  Without knowing if something like that existed, I was glad to find it here.  However, the content is too grown up for her.  Some of the episodes deal with Hello Kitty's friends' disbelief of Santa and they try to convince her that he's not real.  In another episode, Hello Kitty runs away from home.  I was shocked at the content and have since discreetly removed the DVD from our collection.  Maybe when she's a little older she can have it back.",1375142400,2,514,4.532608695652174
8037335,5,B00062IZRM,"My two-year old niece loves her ""Kitty"" tapes, so I bought this one for her for Christmas to add to her collection. Great Santa story with lessons to be learned and inroads to discussion. Like the title says, its Hello Kitty AND Friends. The first two episodes on the disc are Hello Kitty stories, but the remaining one or two star Karoppi (sp?), and other Sanrio characters in whom my niece wasn't all that interested at first, but began to watch after playing the Kitty episodes in her usual ""looped"" manner. Kitty and her twin, Mimmy, do make some cameo appearances in these other episodes, which was a hook for my girl to give them a chance. I think these other stories have broadened her appreciation of the other characters and story line possibilities.",1357171200,,759,4.6716417910447765
8037336,4,B00062IZRM,"Thanks to this DVD set, I was able to get in touch with my beloved ""Santa's Missing Hat"", one that I had hoped to see for years. The Christmas gift Kerropi episode was also very memorable. All the other episodes are... Okay. But I do recommend this to those who like Hello Kitty, whether girls OR.boys. I hope customers will be able to find this online somewhere if they want it.",1354406400,2,379,4.352112676056338

8037338,5,B00062IZRM,super fun collection there are tons of episodes on here! well worth the money and the stories are sooooo cute i don't mind when my daughter watches them for the 20th time.,1233792000,9,171,4.375
