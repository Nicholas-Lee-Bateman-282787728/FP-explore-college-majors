8476887,1,B005KL0QMQ,"WARNING! This is a Region 2 dvd meaning you will need a compatible dvd player for it to work. I wish this had been clearer in the description. As I did not wish to purchase a new dvd player, I returned the item to Great Britain and had to file an A to Z claim with Amazon, who ultimately credited me for the item. I was still out the $17.95 for return shipping though. I learned my lesson the hard way. You've been warned!!",1454457600,,423,4.0476190476190474
