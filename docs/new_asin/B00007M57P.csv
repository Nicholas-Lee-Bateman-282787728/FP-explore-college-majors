1821832,5,B00007M57P,William Demeo does a great job in this movie and I think who ever slams this guy doesnt know acting. He will be a great one for years to come. The other actors are quality as well. This movie was developed nicely and I think is a quality mob flick for any real movie fan...not just someone out there to tarnish somebody's image.,1076284800,3,328,4.222222222222222
1821833,1,B00007M57P,"I have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it wasn't the same movie I have. This movie in no way represents the life of La Cosa Nostra. There are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic. It's present day and the guys are ""running numbers"". Hello, ever hear of the Lottery. They start up a ""bookie buisness"". Besides calling it a bookie buisness, which is just plain retarded, how are 4 nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster. Then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him. I guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over. Then again that might have been a good thing. The acting was terrible except for the late Ray Serra and Joe D'Onofrio. Even Joe Viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed Tons of work. Rent the HBO film Gotti if you want to see what it's really like. Just to include Wannabees and William DeMao in the same breath as Goodfellas and the great living legend Robert DeNiro is an insult. Now DeMao is making ""Searching for Bobby DeNiro"", he could only wish. The only reason I gave it a star is because I had to, they don't let you give it none.",1066867200,9,1415,4.2250922509225095

What a great movie the actors are highly underated and are now some of my favorites. Another thing that was cool was that the actor William Dameo played the voice of Paulie in the new video game Mafia and many of the same character names are used in this film that were from the video game. Tell ya what...Look out for the actors in this movie, all of them should be leading actors in the years to come. Get this movie, it will be one of your favorites.",1052179200,7,562,4.165137614678899

1821914,3,B00007M57P,"Wannabes (2000) from Charles A. Addessi (Director), is right on
target in reconfirming the American Mob stereotype that most movie
goers already have by conjuring a tale of men born and raised in the
Italian section of Brooklyn, New York. There is one exception: the
story takes place in the 1990's, in an era dominated by computers and
technology, wherin many have a whole range of life and work options
at their disposal that wasn't the case at the turn of 20th century.

Some fans of the Godfather series will rent this DVD, perhaps
criminologists will be keen on it, and others curious of the
lifestyle and sociological aspects of running a book business of bets
and gambling too.

This work is clearly ultra-violent, and doesn't shy away from showing
the ugly reality behind various life situations, underworld
individuals controlling a given territory in a city, protection and
gambling rackets, etc. As such, it's an underworld 101 course for the
younger viewers, including frequent cussing over the entire work.

Most lacking, is the almost complete absence of great music, or any
music for that matter. Questionable, is the rabid microcosm focusing
on Italian pals who grew up together and open a risky gambling joint
venture.

Another aspect it the total absence of law enforcement in the
narrative, as if none existed in the world, except for a warning to
be careful when talking over the phone, comparing it to a stick of
dynamite from phone taps.

The better aspects of WANNABES, is the way the film explains to
viewers the risk and rewards of being a bookie, requiring tough
collection of bad debts, involvement in loan-sharking, the stress of
being either a leader or a brown noser to the leader essential in
maintaining prestige and progressing. Once entered, it's very
difficult to leave as a means to earn a living.

Gambling being a disease, it turns neighbor against neighbor,
impoverishes the weak willed against their propensity to gamble,
beyond their abilities to repayl it's a zero-sum game for services
rendered that have little or no socially redeeming value.

The rivalry of up-and-comers keeps viewers on the edge of their
seats. Strip joints, backrooms of pubs, other sections of NYC,
Spanish Harlem are shown.

The action will scare many law abiding citizens, as young men ride
together in a car, looking for trouble, with car vandalism and
baseball bat agressions intimidating bad debtors.

The story steers clear of absurdity and comedy, with simple dialog,
at times, tugging at people's heart strings through recollections of
childhood memories of baseball, sports, girlfriends, growing into
maturity.

Unfortunately, WANNABES is predictable and many will shy away from it
just from the unsavory language used over the 90 mins by the
protagonists. As art, it has its place, as did Pulp Fiction, etc. 2 1/2
stars.",1270166400,3,2846,5.036170212765957
