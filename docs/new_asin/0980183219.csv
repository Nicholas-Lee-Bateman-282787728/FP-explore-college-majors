I've had a Cricut Cake for a number of years. I've tried to use it several times without luck. When I saw this video I knew I had to have it. The day it arrived I watched it and figured out a number of things I was doing wrong. For one, the food products I tried to cut were too thick. I love the recipes that came with this DVD and the tips. I am looking forward to watching the second video and trying out some techniques. I have truly learned so much from this video. The three ladies are truly experts and I recommend that anyone who has a Cricut Cake - even if you think you have all the tricks figured out - buy this video. It was just enlightening and educational!",1426032000,17,798,4.082802547770701
7794967,5,0980183219,Love this DVD. It is easy to watch and they teach  step by step instructions for using the machine. Also get a recipe to use.  Really informative and worth it.,1405987200,,159,4.266666666666667
7794968,5,0980183219,"Love love love this dvd. It cost a little more than I wanted to spend, but after watching it over and over again. I know I will get my moneys worthier. They give you the receipt for the gum paste to use in the cricut cake machine. And you get step by step instructions on how to get the perfect cut. The only thing is I would like to see them make more volumes of this Cake Treasures Collection Volumes 3,4,5 and 6",1388188800,2,414,4.0
7794969,5,0980183219,"The instructions that came with my Cricut Cake machine were of no help, so I was excited to see this DVD that promised success with the Cricut system.  It is everything that I have wanted and needed to be a successful Cricut gumpaste cutter.  It is full of ideas, complete instructions for making your own gumpaste that really works, rolling it and placing it on the cutting mats, and then utilizing the Cricut designs especially for your cake.  I am now a successful Cricut Cake designer, and I have Carrie Biggers and her instructional DVD to thank for it.  This is well worth your time to purchase and review.  You will have success!",1387670400,4,636,4.592920353982301
