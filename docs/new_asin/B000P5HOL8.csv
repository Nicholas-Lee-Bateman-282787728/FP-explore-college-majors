I originally saw this when it aired on the History Channel & I thought it was one of the best military documentaries relating to the secret weapons of the Third Reich. I purchased the DVD which is actually a licensed ""DVD-R"" directly from the History Channel's website. Note there are no interactive menus or chapter stops in this DVD-R. Just hit the ""play"" button and watch.

The program mixes computer animations (which are very good) with actual, vintage footage and interviews with scientists, military officials and historians. The opening sequence shows a computer animation of a nuclear strike on New York by a Nazi V2 Rocket launched from a U-boat during World War II. Shocking!

We also learn of long range bombers with Nuclear capabilities, advance jet aircraft such as the ME-262 with actual footage and other aircaft that was still on the drawing board (but computer animations derived from blueprints are shown). The most interesting information is the unfinished development of nuclear weapons (atom bombs) that Nazi Germany could have developed and launched as warheads from their V2 rockets. Fortunately for the Allies, the war ended before Nazi Germany had enough time to truly develop these secret weapons that one has to ponder if the secret weapons could have really turned the tide of World War II.

Overall, I higly recommned this DVD-R. It reallly is a fascinating and speculative look at the advanced weapons of Nazi Germany that were truly ahead of its time!",1223510400,2,1688,5.58203125
