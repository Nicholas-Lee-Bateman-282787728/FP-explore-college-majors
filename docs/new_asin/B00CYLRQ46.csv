5751829,5,B00CYLRQ46,"Ive been looking at Pokemon and Yugioh DVD's and i keep seeing people talking about not wanting the English version but would rather the Japanese version, I'm starting to sense that its not just about the Language spoken in the DVD's but rather the production from back in the day. I want to find DVD's where the characters are speeking English but i don't want some knockoff remake.  Can someone help me grasp what i should be looking for if i want to watch what i saw when i was growing up pleasee.",1374969600,,500,4.376344086021505
5751830,4,B00CYLRQ46,"So Amazon has this listed as being Japanese with English subtitles AND being dubbed in English. I saw that and got super excited, and pre-ordered immediately. However, I did some digging around on other sites and this same product is listed as being the 4kids English dub only.
Does anyone know for sure?
I'll be so happy if I am finally able to purchase the original Japanese version of the show, but it will be a huge letdown if it is only the 4kids English version. ):
(Not that I don't like the English version, I've just been searching for the original for a very long time. )",1374796800,5,581,4.388888888888889
5751831,5,B00CYLRQ46,"Yugi Moto, a young high school student, and his friends enjoy a card game called duel monsters.  However things change when he puts together an ancient golden puzzle and awakens an inner ability and takes the game to a whole new level.  But when a power hungry madman desires Yugi's puzzle for the power within, Yugi must enter a all or nothing dueling tournament to save those he loves - and make new friends and rivals along the way.

I remember watching these when I was younger and currently watching the more uncut versions on Nicktoons (along with Digimon season 1).  While I never got into the actual game (preferred Magic the gathering over it), I did enjoy the development of the characters and all the adventures they had.  Old fans will enjoy remembering the best duels and new fans can see where it all began.",1374624000,,821,4.595890410958904
5751832,5,B00CYLRQ46,"I've been watching yugioh since I was a little kid. Since I was about 4 - 5 years old. I just recently found out that it was actually an anime because I didn't really know what anime was back then. I really like Yu-gi-oh and very happy to hear they're re-mastering it because the lip syncing was off A LOT! I will be happy to add this to my anime collection once its released on DVD.

I will difinetly purchase this, because it brings back a lot of memories while watching it with my sisters as a kid ^_^.",1373846400,2,505,4.101010101010101

5751843,5,B00CYLRQ46,This does not have the Japanese Audio just the 4kids episodes. The way we can ever get the Japanese Audio is if Cinedigm and 4Kmedia would team up with Funimation to continue the uncut Yu-Gi-Oh Series. With that said I'm still glad to own this season on dvd because it's a huge [art of my childhood. It brings back a lot of nostalgia. So I only recommend buying these dvds if you grow-up watching the 4kids dub of Yu-Gi-Oh like I did. But if you want the uncut version then don't buy these dvds.,1452297600,,495,4.276595744680851

Fast forward to today and 4k Media and Cinedigm have made my dreams come true. The complete first season of Yu-Gi-Oh.

What we have here is a two volume, 6-disc set that contains the entirety of the 4Kids  English dub. Some folks may have a problem with this, but this is the cartoon I know and grew up with. Far as I can tell, the discs are laid out in the order they were aired on TV. The only con I can think of is no included episode list, but at a price this affordable not a big deal. Overall 5 stars easily. Thank you Konami, 4K Media, and Cinedigm you guys are the best.",1389830400,,784,4.012820512820513

ANYWAY, GREAT PURCHASE! perfect for the nostalgia nerd of any kind!",1385856000,3,453,4.27906976744186
5751897,5,B00CYLRQ46,"A great re-release for those who want to re-live their childhoods and are feeling nostalgic. The old season box sets have been out of print for years now and are selling for outrageous prices lately. Well, now you can finally own the exact same amount of episodes per season in an all new release! All of Duelist Kingdom in one set, including Dungeon Dice Monsters.

The packaging itself isn't exactly anything to write home about. It comes with 2 DVD cases with 3 discs per case - six discs in total. You can purchase the volumes individually as well, but why wouldn't you want to? You can get both of them in this set for practically the same price as you would be paying for them individually. Plus, you'll get a cardboard box to hold the volumes that they come with. Once all five seasons are placed together on a shelf, you will get a nice image of Exodia on the spine. Or an image of Yami Yugi with his duel disk on the other side of it.

The packaging does what it has to do, however if you're looking for anything besides the cases, discs and the cardboard box to hold them together.. you will be disappointed.

This release contains ONLY the edited 4Kids English dub from the early 2000's. These episodes are not uncut, are not in Japanese/dual audio, and do not contain translated subtitles. English captions may be another story though, I haven't checked for any.

The dub for the main characters is pretty fitting, no complaints. Especially considering I grew up with this dub and this kind of a release to begin with, as I'm sure most nostalgic fans buying this set did.

These discs contain no extras what-so-ever. No music videos, no trailers, no promos, etc. Totally and completely bare-bones.

If you need to be explained to on what the series is about, I'd suggest heading over to Wikipedia. I don't see any need to explain what the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise is about at this point in the series lifetime.

Overall, if you're a nostalgic fan looking to re-live your childhood and the good old days of Kids WB from the early 2000's, then this set is 100% for you. Don't go in expecting anything more than what you saw as a kid, I'll tell you that right now.

Good price - Decent packaging - Entire season set. 5/5 stars in my book. - I'm just glad to be able to add another piece of my childhood to my collection.",1384905600,,2324,4.464622641509434

5751899,5,B00CYLRQ46,I grew up on this dub. I honestly prefer this over the Japanese version simply because this is what I know and grew up on. The DVD is perfect. It comes packaged nicely and the quality is amazing! It takes me back to my childhood. I've spent so long trying to find the original Yu-Gi-Oh series and I now have the first and second seasons! Definitely gonna pre-order the third sometime soon.,1384128000,,389,4.416666666666667

I was finally able to get my money back and that same day found out that yugioh was being re-released on dvd. Happy Dance time!! Thanks to Amazon sending a perfect set, they will be getting all my business for the future seasons.

I enjoy both the english dub and japanese dub. If you grew up watching the 4kids version go for it. As for the Japanese uncut versions you can try other resources like ebay I currently have: Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 1 49 episodes, Yu-Gi-Oh! Season 2 Uncut Volumes 1 - 11. Yu-Gi-Oh Uncut Unedited Japanese dub/english dub's volumes 1-3. Since 4kids canceled vol. 4 red eyes black dragon's dvd Haven't been able to find it anywhere else. I have Yu-Gi-Oh! Movies 1&2 and Capsule Monsters. I hope to collect the rest soon but like I said ifyou're a true fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! Buy either one most people prefer the japanese dub, Im going to remind you this is not the japanese dub version only the 4kids english version. P.S. Dan Green Is a great voice-actor in my opinnion. If you're looking for the original Yu-Gi-Oh! Search on Youtube for the Japanese dub: Yu-Gi-Oh! ""Season 0""",1381449600,,999,4.58659217877095

As of now, I am so happy they finally released this box set. This show being a part of my childhood I was so excited to relive it all over again. To be through the friendships and troubles of Yugi,Yami,and the rest of the gang. So what if it is in English dub for I really don't care. Still love the series.

I also noticed that the people who re-released also own the rights to the digimon series that they too are re-releasing. Which is great. Looking forward to the re-leases and owning them all.",1379980800,,672,4.209302325581396

5751910,5,B00CYLRQ46,"Yugioh has been my favorite game for almost 12 long years, I am 28 years old and I am still playing this game. This anime is one of my favorites. Since this is not the Japanese version, but the edited version. This beautiful cover had my favorite monster, the mighty and powerful Blue Eyes White Dragon. I do not mind this is the edited version, but I already got the Japanese DVD version of this show, seasons 1-5 from eBay, but the subtitles are a bit messed up, but I do not mind it. The edit and the Japanese versions of this show are different, for example: on the Japanese version ending of episode 32, Bandit Keith threats Pegasus with a gun and demands the prize money or he will shoot him, but on the edited version, he does not have a gun, but he will pound Pegasus if he does not gave the prize money to him before the count of 3. As a fellow fan of Yugioh for almost 12 years, I want you to buy either of the DVDs of this version or the Japanese versions, continue playing this game, read the manga, collect the cards, and one more thing: IT IS YOUR MOVE.",1379808000,,1067,4.159420289855072

I loved this show and I'm glad they are going to be releasing all 5 seasons. I would highly recommend this to any Yu-Gi-Oh fan. I'm so psyched they are going to release all 5 seasons on DVD like Season 4 was never finished; did I say that again? Yeah I did. :D,1379548800,,408,4.049382716049383
5751912,5,B00CYLRQ46,"Just WOW! Ok guys here's the scoop. For those of you that don't know, Yu Gi Oh was originally released by Funimation.
Both in separate volumes and in DVD box sets but they never released the WHOLE series. Most of the series was put on DVD but part of the Doma Saga wasn't. A lot of fans were disappointed in this and frustrated. Plus when Funimation released the DVD's they either had many errors on the discs or part of the footage from certain episodes were cut out. Examples are:

Opening narration for Episodes 1-7 before the opening intro started

Then there was too much added footage for the Yu Gi Oh Logo in every Episode. Having 4 times the Yu Gi Oh Logo before the commercials when there was suppose to be just 1. This was very annoying as every 5 to 10 minutes you would see the Yu Gi Oh Logo pop up and then continue on with the episode.
Not to forget that some episodes were formatted badly on the DVD's. I know two episodes part of the footage had no audio. Weather this was a simple mistake when they burned the DVD's I don't know but it got me mad since the original DVD Box Set for Season 1 was around $70.00-$80.00. Ouch! You heard right! Yes the original DVD releases were very expansive which forced people to buy the separate volumes and even those were around $20.00 at the time.

Now here we are with a new DVD release by New Video Group. They got the rights from Konami and 4K Media to release the whole series on DVD. I just finished watching my set and all I have to say is WOW! New Video Group done this release the right way! There's no errors on the DVD's, no footage missing and no annoying Yu Gi Oh Logo popping up every 5 minutes! YES! Heck there's no tv rating either on the episodes another added bonus!

First let's start with the over all packaging. The DVD's are in 2 DVD cases with 3 trays in each case. So a total of 6 DVDs. The 2 DVD Cases are in a cardboard Case holder, or a display box. I am a bit disappointed in the box because I feel it's made out of cheaper quality and it should of been more thicker. I have the Digimon First Season Box Set and it was made more durable. But aside from this fact this is a very good release, much better then the Funimation release like 100 times better.

Now the quality of the episodes. They are perfect! Picture quality is great! and audio is too! The second thing I am disappointed in was that there's no bonus features at all. A bare bones release. I wish that New Video Group could have put the music videos on the DVD's. Or maybe some interviews with the voice actors and actresses. Or art galleries... Anything  lol Well maybe for Season 2's release they'll do something lol... Oh wait! Better yet a Yu Gi Oh card! lol

Anyways guys this is something you should not miss!

Be warned that this is the 4 Kids edited Series. Not a problem for me because this was the first that I watched. And even though I've seen the Japanese version original uncut, I still love the 4 Kid's version as well. And the reason why I love it so much is because I thought the voice actor's and actresses were the best in this. Especially Dan Green and Eric Stuart.

Trust me guys you can't get any better then this release! And I waited 10 years for a better release and here it is!",1379462400,21,3248,4.217391304347826
5751913,5,B00CYLRQ46,The Dvd box it self is really nice for space.  The episodes are space out on 6 dvds so the quality is pretty good.  If you are a fan of the dub it is well worth it for this.,1379116800,4,173,3.41025641025641
5751914,5,B00CYLRQ46,This was the best series ever. The other series sucked b/c it had nothing to do with Yugi only cameos. I can't wait to get my copy then season 3-5 later :D Yugioh was the best show. I've always wanted this series & now I get the chance to own it.,1377129600,,246,3.843137254901961
5751915,5,B00CYLRQ46,"Updated, as of 9/10/13. Read if you need more reasons for buying!

A note for the completists/people who want the uncut versions:
Now, if you're expecting the original Japanese footage & language track, don't hold your breath. This set contains the 4kids edited footage w/ their original dub only, about exactly the same setup as the Digimon releases, with the dubbing being done by a different company, but the end result being the same. If you want the Japanese version, go buy the uncut DVDs, or watch subbed versions online, cause unless Saban &/or Konami team up with the original cast & possibly FUNimation, there's not going to be a release of the Japanese original footage, or the Japanese voice track on home media releases here in America any time soon. Now, you guys gotta understand the awkwardness involved w/ having the Japanese audio on the edited episodes & the 4kids dub on the original versions. The episodes weren't dubbed to the full episodes, like Dragon Ball Z, they were set like they were specifically, so there's certain scenes undubbed that were edited out for the English dub & the Japanese audio would have to be cut according to the footage at hand, so they'd be awkwardly set to each other, if they made that decision to have both on the discs, the dub & uncut/unedited footage, they'd need the cast to come back to dub those parts, which would be more effectively done in a new, better uncut dub, like 4kids started releasing several years ago, but cancelled because of copyright reasons, so pick your battles with getting these types of sets, cause you're not gonna win all of them with these releases.
Note done.

Now, if you're like me & you grew up on this dub & don't have much of a problem with it, you won't be disappointed with these season sets. They have the full seasons on the discs & the original English dub too, since New Video Group partnered up with Saban & Konami to release the original dubs & edited versions of Digimon & Classic Yugioh on DVD. Until Amazon gets pictures of the product, trust me when I say that I've seen product pictures online & you won't be disappointed with the packaging & stuff, as it's worthy of a release like this.

Now, hopefully if every fan of this series buys all the seasons & they all sell well, they might release GX & 5Ds too & hopefully finish the dubbing started by 4kids with the original casts of both of those series & release the Bonds Beyond Time movie here in America. So please, just enjoy this for what it is & stop complaining for once in your lives as anime fans.

Can't wait for it's release, especially since its price is very reasonable. Hey, at least they're not as much as the Digimon series releases. I can't wait for this release, personally & I emplore you people to think the same.

Update 7/29: Since the downfall of 4kids, Konami has bought the full rights to the series' of Yugioh & Saban has bought the broadcast rights to the franchise, as to explain why it's airing on Nicktoons, as Saban teamed up with them to air Power Rangers in 2010, so I guess it only seemed logical to let them air the shows.

Update 9/10, the packaging: The packaging is great & the design is awesome! I feel the disc cases are a callback to the Funimation/4kids dvd cases, seeing as it's basically the same type of cases, but the cases come with 3 disc holders. Now on the packaging as a whole, it has an outer box with  the Blue-Eyes White Dragon on it, as you may have seen. What you might not know, is that both sides have 2 different pictures on either side. On the left hand side of the front, it has a picture, along with the rest of the sets, will make Exodia, while the picture on the sides of the cases, will make a picture of Yami/The Pharaoh/Dark Yugi, for whoever prefers whatever, holding his duel disk from seasons 2 'til the end of the series, not to mention the end of GX, Bonds Beyond Time, & the movie. Now, I'd prefer buying this one over the volume releases, since it has these few extra things & a cool box case on the outside. On the back of the box, it says ""It's time to duel"" & other stuff that describes the series. Now, it might be just the 4kids dub, but it's still the show in a great format & presentation.

Now, I've read an article that said that Cinedigm & 4K Media struck a deal to release the rest of the Yugioh series', which could mean that they'll dub the rest of GX & 5Ds, or at least it's implied they will, since 4Kids didn't finish the dubs for those shows, they'll hopefully finish them, since they have the resources to do such a thing, since they are dubbing Zexal, it's just a matter of getting the casts back, writing the episodes, & license the episodes for dubbing & release everywhere outside of Asia. Link: [...]
I have a feeling they'll do that anyways, since GX, is probably gonna air on Nicktoons & the DVD will coincide with the airings of the episodes.

Now, overall, I give it a 8.5-9/10, for having all the episodes from the 1st arc, until the end of the mini ""Dungeon Dice Monsters"" arc. Plus, only having the 4kids English dub sets it back a little, & not do an entirely new uncut dub & finish what 4kids & Funimation started in 2004-2005, as I've stated above, but I'm not complaining too much. This is the dub I grew Up on & I'm happy to own it on DVD. Plus such great packaging for a beloved childhood memory & a highly sought after series that's DVDs ran out of print years ago. The cheapest DVDs, are the single & those can run you $100, more or less Plus the 1st 3 season DVDs, can run you 100s of dollars, plus seasons 4 & 5 were never released in season format, so this is your best option for owning this series outside of Asia. Can't wait for seasons 2-5 to be released, as well as GX & 5Ds on DVD, don't care for Zexal at all, & the Bonds Beyond Time movie in America, since it was only released in the U.K. for the English Dub. Maybe I'm shooting too high for now, but I'm pretty sure that they'll eventually be released here in America. Plus being a fan of Yugioh Abridged on YouTube, it's fun to see where all of the jokes towards the 4Kids dub in the series in the beginning & every so often afterwards & truly appreciate it all a bit more.

In summation; great release of this show on DVD, especially coming from someone who owns the vol 1 DVD single & knowing Funimation's DVD releases from back in the day. Cinedigm/New Video Group, is fastly becoming the new Shout! Factory. Now, if you weren't around, or old enough to keep track of Yugioh DVD releases back in the day & have a certain affinity for the series, as I & many other old fans, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. As with new fans, who wanna see where the franchise began, you won't wanna miss where it began & see why people like this show. Greatest release of the show on DVD & yes, I'm considering all the factors here, & probably always will be. THIS is how you release a beloved show on to DVD, Funimation! If you get what I'm talking about, thanks.

BUY THESE RELEASES & SUPPORT THEM. THEY ARE BOSS & I HAVE NOTHING BUT GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT! Thanks.

Thanks for reading this, if you did & I hope you've made your decision.

I lived in Thailand and purchased the Season 5 bfor I purchased other seasons. The transportation of the products is always very fast everytime. And the quality of the DVDs is also very good in English dub too. I really love the products and will buy YuGiOh GX and 5D's in the future for sure.

The only problem that I'd rather give 4.5 stars more than 5 stars is there was no anti-break cushin in the parcel box. And some area of the rim of my DVD box was crushed(just small lesions, not severe at all) and that made the customer really feel sad.
