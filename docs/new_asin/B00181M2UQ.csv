One very sore spot in America is so-called ""public"" education.  A better name would be Marxist education.  It is one of the ten planks of the Communist manifesto.

A total separation of education and state is long overdue.  Not only would it eliminate the parasitic plunder generated by teachers' unions along with illegal aliens and other reckless child bearers, but it would also eliminate the indoctrination of our children by socialist and communist powers that be.

With the internet, practically everybody has the opportunity to get a top notch education at a minimal cost--as long as government does not get in the way.",1330732800,,876,5.214285714285714
