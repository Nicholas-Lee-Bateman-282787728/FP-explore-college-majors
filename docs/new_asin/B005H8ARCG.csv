4699074,5,B005H8ARCG,"this was my only the second k-drama i had ever seen and i LOVE it.  the characters are well developed.  it does have a formula, but there are some nice little twists and turns in it that make you smile.  it had a nice balance.  i didn't scream at the tv saying, ""just tell him you love him.""  lol.. it is a great series!!.
package came very quickly and was just as the seller said. would buy from them again.",1368576000,4,408,4.05
4699075,5,B005H8ARCG,"The intensity of the acting makes you feel that it is really believable, and it is not really a movie, but real life.",1366156800,,117,4.130434782608695
4699076,5,B005H8ARCG,"I COULDN'T STOP LOOKING AT THIS SERIES. I ENJOYED THE PREMISE OF THE STORY EVEN THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS MAKE BELIEVE. THE ACTORS WERE OUTSTANDING AND THE LOCATIONS WERE INTERESTING. BUY IT, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR , YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!",1356739200,,231,4.523809523809524
4699077,4,B005H8ARCG,Secret Garden was a touching romance that was also filled with a lot of funny moments and interesting plot and sub-plot twist. There wasn't one dull episode and I would highly recommended it.,1399766400,,191,4.818181818181818
4699078,3,B005H8ARCG,"So I bought this for my mom who is OBSESSED with this show.  But she told me that this isn't the right version to buy.  I purchased it b/c it was cheaper, but I guess the reason why it's cheaper is because of the subtitles.  The subtitles for English on this version don't translate as well as the other more expensive version,  I guess that's the reason why this one is cheaper than the other.  It was hard to know which one to buy based on the information on Amazon.  I will say though, my mom LOVES these shows.",1398124800,6,514,4.141414141414141
4699079,4,B005H8ARCG,"Korean tv miniseries tend to revolve around the complexities of human relations centering on the odd pairing of love triangles that often deal with the Handsome Rich Man falling for the Beautiful Poor Girl. In the SECRET GARDEN, the handsome man may be handsome but he is also an arrogant conceited whining jerk. He sees a stuntwoman and falls for her even as he insults her with cutting remarks about her appearance, her genealogy, and her lowly financial status. She is turn shows anger over his remarks and demands that he leave her alone but she never follows through strongly enough to discourage him. SECRET GARDEN could have been filmed without the fantasy of switching bodies/souls since the switching did not materially add to their perspective; further, the director's habit of magically fading in and fading out of their bodies confused the viewer as to who was who. Still, SECRET GARDEN is not meant as a realistic blending of various cinematic genres. Its purpose was to trace the evolution of the often inexplicably tortuous progress of love in two lovers who seem to have nothing in common but love. This film continues to show an amazingly consistent trait in Korean cinema. Though SECRET GARDEN involves love it does so only with the farcical traces of love. Love is mocked, kicked at, mystified and otherwise laughed at, it remains at core platonic. It is not until the end that the lovers get down to the serious physical side of love with a trio of just-born children attesting to the biological aspects of love. I found numerous examples of shock and dismay on the part of the female when the male dared to grab an unannounced smooch. If one likes a Victorian Oscar Wilde hybrid of drawing room comedy mixed with Korean film tradition, then SECRET GARDEN is well worth the time to watch all twenty episodes.",1397520000,,1828,4.806349206349206
4699080,4,B005H8ARCG,"This show was a gateway drug to the wide world of Korean dramas. On a whim, I decided to watch it on Netflix and I was hooked as soon as I finished the second episode. Be ready for some wacky stuff to happen and enjoy the ride! This box set translates all of the songs too, which I love. I've seen this show on 3 different formats now, and this one has another slightly different translation of the dialogue, with some translations making more sense and others making less sense. The packaging of this particular box set  is a case with probably 20 flimsy plastic sleeves, and the 5 discs are in only 5 of them. It keeps the discs protected I suppose, but for almost $50 the case could have been nicer.",1396656000,2,702,4.2781954887218046
4699081,5,B005H8ARCG,"I wasn't much for watching shows with subtitles but it was available for free streaming so I thought 'why not.' The first episode pulls you in with the bad boy rich kid meeting the poor stunt woman. They don't get along at first but soon the tension builds and as viewers you know they are meant for each other. Just my kind of romantic book turned into a drama. Hands down Hyun Bin and Ha Ji Won (the two main actors) are my favorites probably because this was the first drama I watched. The storyline was romantic, funny, and angsty. I'm not much for sci-fi but the body swapping portion of the show didn't last long and it was essential to the storyline of the two main characters understanding one another.

I'm in my 30's and don't speak Korean but the subtitles were easy to follow. After raving about this show (and other Kdramas) to my friends and family - more of them are hooked. I always suggested this drama as one to check out first. The nice thing is that Kdramas tend to only be 20 or less episodes so story lines do not fall flat like most American shows that continue until they are suddenly cancelled.

If you are looking for something different to watch - give this one a try. You won't regret it!",1390608000,5,1216,4.352422907488987
4699082,5,B005H8ARCG,5 STARS because the show well well put together. When i got though to the second to last disc i was in  tears in a good way for a long time. Not spoiling ending but this show was amazing. I recommend this show. Plus it has many languages and English subtitles as well.,1390003200,,268,4.056603773584905
4699083,5,B005H8ARCG,"So good that you miss their world when it's over.  All the secondary characters drawn well, so you want a sequel.  The music & sets beautiful, the story ends realistically.  Will revisit them thru the years many times, which is high praise indeed!",1386892800,,247,4.6976744186046515
4699084,5,B005H8ARCG,This is my second favorite drama after Boys Over Flowers and before 154 other dramas I've watched. It was delivered on time and in a neat and clean package. I recommend this to everyone.,1384819200,,186,4.5
4699085,4,B005H8ARCG,"Very, very good series. Very well acted with amazingly skill. Also, all 4 leads are very  good looking. Especially the rich store owner and the super wealthy, connected rich girl.
It also can be very funny with the rich man as the poor stunt woman. The look on his/her new face when he sees the major dump she has to live in is terriffic. ALso, he hates her chothes & buys her a new wardrobe. Its very funny & well handled that he is far more concerned with clothes as both man & when he's her than she is.
The reactions around them are also a hoot, no one can believe how suddenly 'nice' 'he' has become. And now 'unplesant' ' & superior acting 'she' has become in the action school. As the girl forces him to go there and act like her. There is a wonderful where pretending to her sees his female friend &  shrink & hears how life will be almost impossible for 'her' because his family will destroy her if it gets serious & he will not protect her because she's not important enough.
But there are many funny scenes. My favorite is when they visit a spa will in each other's body and he spend time with his cousin's old family in a sauna  & she in a not tub with his cousin.
They are not each other all the time, but instead swap back & forth & maybe spend a week as each other before swapping back.
Good subtitles.",1383609600,,1317,4.1568627450980395
4699086,5,B005H8ARCG,"I saw bits of this while I was in South Korea and every business I walked into that had a TV either had this show on or had news about this show on.  I assumed that it was some sort of Korean version of Twilight so I thought I'd get it for a laugh.  THIS IS THE MOST INSANE THING I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I CAN'T STOP WATCHING!!!!  There are so many weird plot twists and awkward stares and the soundtrack is so oddly featured that I actually bought it on iTunes.  If you like weird things and don't mind subtitles then get this.  Two pieces of advice. 1) Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands 2) The DVD defaults to Chinese so you end up reading English subtitles, dubbed in Chinese, while the actors are speaking Korean.  Switch the audio track back to Korean and it makes it much more enjoyable.
MILD SPOILER:  If you think this show is crazy just wait until they drink the magic potion!!!!",1375228800,6,898,4.126436781609195
