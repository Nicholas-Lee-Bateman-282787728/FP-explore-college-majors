6251721,5,B00I5YB6N8,"Whilst I admit that this season was, in my view, a little lacklustre, it still features the first time the show went to Cambodia, which was a highlight for me, and many other interesting spots. I found that I didn't really like or engage with any of the teams much this season- the pushy wife and her athletic husband, who seemed to be trying to prove to her that he was good husband despite past transgressions, the two dimensional Nick and Starr, the weird nerdy frat boys... I dunno, they just didn't do it for me. BUT the show itself is always fabulous and it's great that more seasons are being released.",1401148800,2,609,4.446428571428571
6251722,5,B00I5YB6N8,I have enjoyed every season of the Amazing Race. This was no exception. It arrived on time and in new condition. The competition can sometimes become unfriendly but the scenery is beautiful and the challenges fun to watch. I look forward to the release of s14.,1401062400,2,260,4.673913043478261

6251725,1,B00I5YB6N8,"Couple weeks ago, read reviews abt Race 12&13 being ordered by others that arrived scratched,damaged,whatever.  Amazon said online they'd find and fix problem.  Remarks disappeared from site so I thought prob fixed. So I ordered. DVD's arrived today. 5 of 6 discs damaged (marks,smudges,whatever.)  Dvds freeze at that point and won't play.  DO NOT BUY THESE YET!",1398038400,2,363,5.315789473684211
6251726,3,B00I5YB6N8,"the first nine seasons of TAR on DVD had closed captions or subtitles. From season ten on, no closed captions or subtitles are included with sets. Very disappointing. We have a deaf family member who cannot enjoy this set so we had to return it.",1397520000,2,245,4.466666666666667

6251728,5,B00I5YB6N8,"Loved this season but felt Toni and Dallas weren't really portrayed to their full extent. I know they would have won if it wasn't for the cabbie taking off inadvertantly with Dallas' passport.

I've met Toni and her personality is gregarious and she doesn't take garbage from anyone - let them show her true personality - she is a blast!",1397001600,,337,4.616666666666666
6251729,5,B00I5YB6N8,"I saw this season while it was happening so I won't spoil it for you! Hey hey, Amazing Race Producers, what's with giving teams 3 chances?? Really?? Let's race the best against the best! Bring back all the winners for a rematch! Make it harder and crown a champion!!",1394323200,,266,4.448979591836735
8639561,1,B00I5YB6N8,"The show it's self is awesome - I am a big ""Amazing Race fan"" but with that being said the 3rd disk is almost unplayable.  It freezes up and skips every minute or so.  I look at the disk and there are no visible scratches, dirt or finger prints that would cause the problem BUT it does look weird - not like a normal dvd but a bronxy - purple wavy like looking spots that I have never seen on a dvd before.  I have no idea what the problem is with the 3rd disk but its virtually unwatchable.  The first 2 disks play fine but the 3rd is terrible",1524355200,,544,3.918181818181818
8639562,4,B00I5YB6N8,"Fun above average season.  Have all but 2 early seasons on disk and all those purchased from Amazon or its sellers have been in perfect condition, both the new and the used.  Glad AR finishes with a real winner and doesn't pick a winner based on who cries for jury at final tribal!",1490659200,,281,4.283018867924528

8639569,3,B00I5YB6N8,"Haven't finished it yet but I sincerely didn't remember this season; maybe Dallas and his mom and Ken & Tina. I always have loved to watch the countries they go & the tasks they have to do before getting to the pitstop. This time the dvds haven't skipped or stopped on a scene. This is my favorite reality show and the first I started to watch; The Amazing Race is a challenge to all those who compete for the one million dollars but also a test of strength, patience, endurance, teamwork and most of all love of nature and friendship.",1406246400,,535,4.36
8639570,2,B00I5YB6N8,Two of the 3 discs have scratches. On the disc I've played so far it forced the episode to freeze. Only work around was to miss that portion of the show. Disappointing.,1401321600,,168,4.28125
