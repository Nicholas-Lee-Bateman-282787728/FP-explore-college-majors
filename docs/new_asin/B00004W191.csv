This concert is a wonderful showcase for Barry - the musician and the man.  The taping gave an intimate, you-are-there quality that was very special.  A great gift for someone who has never seen Barry in concert.",970531200,2,353,4.303030303030303
1359228,5,B00004W191,"This show is for fans and non fans alike. It's amazing. Barry is in great voice, his selection of songs is superb and the orchestra sounds divine.  ""Every single day"" and ""Stars in the night"" (from his forthcoming broadway musical ""Harmony"") alone are worth the 20 something dollars you pay for this DVD. They're some of the most beautiful songs I have EVER heard by ANY performer. Rivetting. They'll take your breath away.  No wonder Rolling Stone has called him ""the showman of our generation"".",970444800,17,496,4.823529411764706
1359229,4,B00004W191,"Since you are reading this you are a Barry Manilow fan already so the recommedation is easy...go get the DVD. The video and sound are great. The video was mastered in High Def (16x9) and the picture shows that (wait till we get a High Def DVD!). Barry sounds great, does a lot of his standard songs and some new ones from his broadway show. Full orchestra backup. I don't know how long Barry can keep belting out those ballads..not easy songs to do for as long as he has been doing them. This is a definitive video. My only question is the sound mastering. It is done in DD/DTS 4.0, which in this case means no center channel sound. I don't understand the engineer's choice on this as I much prefer an ""anchored"" voice in the middle. The engineer could have blended some of the vocal in the center. Ah well, a small problem.

Everyone knows a Manilow song and you will love this new DVD.  He sings some of his biggest hits and then some.

1359231,5,B00004W191,"Nashville Tennessee was the place to be that cold cold week in February when the wonderful Barry Manilow taped ""Manilow Live"" before a  packed house at TPAC.  His interactiveness with the audience, and  especially his interpertation of a song makes this the DVD to own; and it  will become a much sought after collectors item.  He honored us with a  selection from his new musical ""Harmony""....and sang his old  standards also. Oops...did I say ""old""...nothing about Barry  Manilow is old nor is his music.  He is legend..a gifted musician....a  showman...and a wonderful person...who through his genuis has brought this  wonderful concert to life and is to be shared with all those who have the  opportunity to purchase it.  I know....its' wonder...I was there ""up  front"" on that glorious night in February

I have seen the shortened preview of this show (6  songs were cut from the original concert) shown in June on DirecTV.  The  energy during the live performance was not lost on the tape at all.  Barry  gave 1000% of himself that night for this performance.  He's amazing and  proves that he undeniably is the ""showman of our generation.""  Barry tenderly carresses each ballad with his sexy voice and makes you want  to get up and dance to the upbeat numbers.  His new songs from  ""Harmony"" will leave you breathless.  All of his hits are there,  masterfully performed. If you aren't already a fan, you will be after you  see this concert! I'm so glad to get it in its original length!  Barry is  amazing.

1359240,5,B00004W191,"Review by Tom's wife. This is a great show!! Barry looks great & very engaging with the audience as usual. His voice sounded stellar. NO surprise there!! While enjoying the show, it seemed like I was right there in the first row!! It's been Barry's dream to write a broadway musical. He gives us a taste of 2 of the songs that are in the musical Harmony. AMAZING!! Sometimes I just want to listen to the music without the lyrics. Seems like he started getting stuff done to his (beautiful) face shortly after this concert. His hair looked great & age appropriate!! Wish he let himself age naturally. :( I would of preferred a DVD but, the price for this VHS was much more affordable.",1381968000,2,683,4.472
1359241,5,B00004W191,"Excellent show! As he matured, so did his voice and performance style. Tribute to Sinatra songs is wonderful. Stars in the Night (from Harmony) is very moving. Second disc with commentary by BM is fun.",1361750400,,201,4.771428571428571

1359246,5,B00004W191,"The multi-musically talented Barry Manilow is at the top of his game on this extraordinary DVD loaded with 24 of Manilow's top hits, beautifully arranged and delivered with the accompaniment of a full live orchestra.
The digital theater system sound (DTS), makes you feel like you are right there at the concert.

Manilow holds his audience captive not only with his charismatic style, musical talent and showmanship, but with his unusual ability to connect on an emotional level with each person in the audience.  From beginning to end, this DVD will hold you spellbound and you will find yourself watching and listening to it over and over again.

You also get a neat audio commentary done by Barry on each song as it is being performed.  This gives a unique insight on his reaction to the audience along with little snippets that add interest and humor to the DVD.

If you are a Barry Manilow fan, or just love great music, this DVD is an absolute must have!",1236816000,2,961,4.696428571428571
1359247,5,B00004W191,This is the best Barry Manilow DVD to buy. There are so many songs on it. Barry's voice is great. The lighting is great. The video quality is great.,1188691200,,148,4.137931034482759
1359248,5,B00004W191,"This is a must have if you enjoy Barry. It is one of his best. The show is absolutely wonderful. He is such a great entertainer. The songs are all some of his very best. The set and lighting, orchestra, and everything is great. You will love this one if you are a great fan like I am. I find myself watching this one over and over. It is great!!! So glad he taped this performance.",1183939200,,381,4.026315789473684
1359249,5,B00004W191,"One of my 3 favorite Barry DVDs, this is a great one to have.  It includes an absolutely GREAT compilation of songs.  It also includes Barry playing the accordion and playing Flight of the Bumblebee on a kazoo!  This is just too cool.  Add that to his wit and charm, as he chit chats with the audience in between, and musical talent and this video is just superb.

There is also a tribute to Frank Sinatra. The DVD includes the upbeat version of ""Could It Be Magic.""  As beautiful as the slow melodic version of that song is, the upbeat version is too cool.  I don't know which version I love best.

The DVD is done in such a way that you feel like you have a front row seat.  The Nashville crowd loves Barry and he gives another 120%.

Barry looks great in this one and puts on a super fantastic show, AGAIN!!!  You won't be disappointed if you grab this one up.",1164499200,4,863,4.201219512195122

1359252,5,B00004W191,"I purchased this based on the recommendations, and I am happy I did.  Barry Manilow really is the consummate professional -- he's charming, funny, and exceptionally talented. He's been doing this a long time, and it shows.  I was so happy to see him sing ""All the Time,"" one of my favorites.  He does two songs from his play ""Harmony,"" ""Every Single Day"" and ""Stars in the Night,"" and you can see that they hold a special place in his heart.  Like someone else reviewed, I never thought of Barry Manilow as sexy until this video -- he has a certain confidence and grace, and yes, he is definitely sexy.  ""Eat your heart out, Ricky Martin,"" indeed.",1126483200,,647,4.495726495726496
1359253,5,B00004W191,"I really loved this album. Sweet Melisa is one of his greatest hits, and one of his most powerful... made a fan of me. Other than that, the DVD is great, and Manilow sounds terrific.  Also there's a full orchestra, which is great.  His Sinatra medly is OK, but really....not neccessary.  It sounded off somehow.  Perhaps it was his choice of tunes that are so associated with Sinatra.  But all the rest of Manilow choice of songs, were very, very powerful, and his kibbitizing with the audience was charming.  I'm very glad I bought it and have watched it many times!",1101168000,3,567,4.564356435643564
1359254,5,B00004W191,"A strong performance with all the great songs. Manilow has the audience in the palm of his hand. Orchestration is excellent, video on DVD looks great. Vocal and emotional performances by Barry deserve a Warning to all true fans.

1359255,5,B00004W191,"Barry Manilow is one of the greatest entertainers today. I purchased this DVD yesterday and I wasn't dissapointed. When Barry opens the show with ""Could It Be Magic"", The crowd is on their feet. Barry performs a lot of his classic hits such as: ""Mandy"", ""Daybreak"", ""Copacabana"", ""Can't Smile Without You"" & ""I Write The Songs"". I love when Barry plays the kazoo on the song, ""Flight Of The Bumblebee"". Barry also performs songs from his hit musical: ""Harmony"". This DVD is for any Barry Manilow fan. Way to go Barry!!!!!!",1081900800,3,522,4.747252747252747

1359257,5,B00004W191,"this video and or DVD was inspired by the TV special ""Manilow Country"" that had aired on The Nashville Network where numerous country singers sung the praises of Manilow. shortly afterward, Manilow taped this concert in Music City. The show was a sell-out of course...all the songs are great and the performance rivals his other video showcases. his signature style is also captured: the piano thumping on up-tempo songs, the light touches on ballads, and in some songs where he doesn't play piano he ends each song with his customary arms wide open send-off as his famed big finishes fade into the sounds of the instruments. ironically, ""Mandy"", in previous concerts was usually near the end of the show...blending into ""Could It Be Magic?""...it's odd hearing the song so close to the opening. ""Even Now"", which requires a LOT of energy if one insists on sounding the same or near the same as the original version from 1978, is the only one that'll show you that Manilow isn't as young as he used to be...but he makes up for it when he repeats the title at least two times in an effort to build up the big finish the audience is expecting to hear. There is also a Sinatra tribute where he sings ""Chicago"" and ""That's Life"". ""Copacabana"" isn't done as elaborate performance wise as we're used to...but no matter. it's a great video...",1076544000,5,1334,4.705128205128205
1359258,5,B00004W191,"I just received the DVD today (ahead of schedule) and was compelled to write.  I have always enjoyed Barry since he began in the 70s, and amazingly in this 2000 concert he sounds as if he hasn't lost one bit of his marvelous touch and range.  He has evolved over the years into a master showman, and in many ways he is better than he was years ago. He truly loves what he does, and he displays the love in his smile, and mannerisms and with his interactions with his fans in the audience.  You feel privileged to be a part of it.  Just try and hold back the tears when you enjoy his classic duet ""I Can't Smile Without You"" with Michelle, the audience member he selects.  Her heartfelt love and admiration for him, and his ability to capture the moment will have you envy the experience she'll treasure forever. Not surprisingly, the picture quality and  audio are incredible! Wow, a real treasure that I'll be listening to and watching for years to come.  Thanks Amazon for suggesting the DVD.",1074816000,3,994,4.458563535911602
1359259,5,B00004W191,"I was overwhelmed with the ""feeling"" in this DVD ""treat"".  I've always loved the Manilow hits, but have never seen Barry in concert.
I never realized the ""warmth"" this wonderful man has.  As he sang, he ""felt"" his music.  Also, his interchange with a fan from the audience, who sang a duet with him, was truly ""touching"".
For whatever reason, I've never thought of Barry Manilow as sexy, but this DVD totally changed my mind.  He is just a living doll.  What I would give to have someone with that caring, charisma and humor in my life.
Seems Mr. Manilow lives next to Suzanne Somers and they have become wonderful friends.  How I envy her. I bet he's a great friend.
As I watched this DVD I couldn't help but think to myself what a wonderful face this man has.  That warm, wonderful, gentle smile.  And . . . those eyes.  You could see the purity in this man's soul.  He has, in my opinion, the face of an ""angel"", and he and his music are truly a ""gift"" straight from God.
This DVD contains a song I used to love, which I had forgotten about.  Never one of his big hits, but a wonderful song called ""All The Time"".  I felt the tears on my cheek when I listened to him sing that song.
If you want a true ""experience"", purchase this DVD.  I promise you, you will receive the ""warm fuzzies"" more than once.
I so enjoyed this DVD, that I bought his music ""boxed"" set, which is a great buy.  Eagerly awaiting my delivery.
I hope Barry considers doing another live concert on DVD in the near future.  WOW!  What a wonderful entertainer.",1057881600,6,1532,4.304195804195804

However, as I felt the music of the live orchestra and Barry's dear, familiar tones flow over me, my heart lifted and began to soar!  This video captures all of the magic of that beautiful concert, and then some.  From the old favorites, to my personal favorite ""All The Time"", to the quirky, charming ""Flight of the Bumblebee"", to the new pieces from Harmony ... Barry proves once again what a gifted, dedicated performer he is.  To old Barry fans and new .... BUY THIS VIDEO!  You won't regret it.",1038096000,,661,4.512605042016807

He spends half his time at the microphone, half at the piano and half dancing.  Wait! That's three halves.  Well, if anyone can pull that off, it is Barry.  The concert includes many of the old favorites but also introduces us to the delightful new music of his Broadway musical ""Harmony"" as well as two selections from ""Manilow Sings Sinatra."" He returns for two encores and almost seems as if he doesn't ever want to leave the stage.  If you like Barry Manilow, you will love this video.",1028160000,2,590,4.36697247706422
1359265,5,B00004W191,"This concert show is very good. Done as if you were sitting in the front row center, Manilow entices you with song and witt.
His concert personality is absolutely down-to-earth. Making fun of his nose, family, first learned instrament and his age. He knows that humor opens up a lot of good feelings.
Then he hits you with his music and his voice. Although he has always been criticized by not being ""cool"" to listen too, Manilow really ""reals"" you into his music, his show and into him.
He cares about his music, what it means and where it goes. More importantly he seems to really care about the audience and what you think.
This DVD is a must for every fan and non-fan alike. The best part is Barry actually does a commentaru about the concert and all the inside of puttting a show on. From the earpiece falling out to the band, lighting, wardrobe, sets and crew. He really talks about what a lot of hard work it is toput on a concert.
Now, I must admit I am biased. And it would be fair to you, the reader, if I didn't tell you that I have seen him 19 times in concert since 1976. Yes I am a fan. I have seen 11 of his ""tours"" and the last was at the newly open Kodak Theatre in Hollywood California as the first concert performer to perform there.
Need I say more. P.S. Here at The Mayflower is his best Album/CD yet!",1023926400,3,1322,4.208661417322834

I bought this DVD at his concert in Milwaukee, WI and was on such a ""high"" from his music, I had to watch the DVD as soon as I got home (2:30AM), and every day since. We have a big screen television 56"" and it is just like being in the audience. He told the story about how his Grandfather had inspired him to sing when he was 3 years old at one of those old record stores they used to have where you can record your voice, and all Barry said was no! He plays it on a scratchy 78 rpm record in the background as he starts singing This One's For You. I have NEVER seen such raw feeling put into every single song that he sings. My Grandchildren even enjoy watching the DVD, espically when he sings Daybreak!  I highly recommend buying this, you will not be disappointed!",1015372800,7,873,4.135294117647059
1359268,5,B00004W191,"I have been attending Barry Manilow concerts for his entire career. It's been an wonderful experience watching Barry evolve and mature over the years.
I've always felt Barry is at his best with a full orchestra as he is in this performance. Turn the lights down in the room while you're watching this concert and you can almost feel like you're there.
Barry's showmanship is superb in this concert. His rapport with the audience gets better and better over the years. His fans love when he calls someone from the audience onstage to sing a duet with him on ""Can't Smile Without You"". The fan he chose for this concert displayed so much exuberance! She was a good representation of what all of his longtime fans feel.
My only disappointment was that he did not have his very talented backup singer Debra Byrd along for this one. However, Barry is at a point in his career that he no longer needs to share the stage with anyone.
I am reviewing this DVD after just coming back from seeing him in person on his 2002 tour. As a die-hard Barry fan, it's difficult to compare the two concerts. They are very different.
MANILOW LIVE is a hard DVD to top. Barry's talent, his love of music, and his deep respect for other musicians leaps from the stage and touches your soul. Enjoy!",1012176000,16,1273,4.515151515151516

Of course he always puts his heart and soul into all his music and concerts. The orchestra playing my song--I MADE IT THROUGH THE RAIN, left me in tears and shivers and an undescribable feeling of pure heaven. I could never pick just one song that I loved more than another. But I MADE IT THROUGH THE RAIN--is my song--so what can I say. He is an excellent performer. He dresses to show respect to his audiences,not like some of todays entertainers. But Barry knows how to please, tease and entertain to the max. The newest one so far--I recommend this to all MANILOW fans everywhere.

I have never sung so loudly in all my life. I knew every word!!! EVERY WORD!!! To all the songs, well the main ones anyway.  I loved it. Totally loved it!! And his voice matches mine perfectly or something like that.

The stage was with-in arms length of the audience and Barry endeared himself to his fans from the very minute he appeared, they literally were on their feet after every song, they just couldn't get enough.  He performed his ""greatest hits"" with as strong and beautiful a voice as you'll ever hear.  If you love great music from a captivating entertainer this is a concert you will enjoy over and over.",981590400,,719,4.542635658914729
1359274,5,B00004W191,"I felt several tugs at my heartstrings listening to Barry's great songs.  Brought back a lot of memories, reminiscing past relationships and how most of the songs were related to them.  You will feel what true love songs really are as you absorb the lyrics and feelings Barry puts in every song. For all romantics and sentimental people like me, this is one good buy.  I wouldn't mind playing it over and over again.",981504000,,416,4.594594594594595
1359275,5,B00004W191,"This is a very impressive performance compared to the choppy and poorly edited previous video, ""The Greatest Hits...And Then Some"".The setlist is strong and the delivery of each musical composition demonstrates Manilow's knack for keeping his 70's born tracks fresh.  All of the songs are well-placed and chosen.  His tribute to Frank Sinatra is reverent, yet lively and celebratory.  With each ballad, Manilow still, after surely performing them thousands of times before, delivers them with the invaluable aide of the 30-piece orchestra that sounds incredible.  Every song features the orchestra and it is easy to tell that special care was taken in the wielding of the melodies. The lights and camera angles are much more colorful and sharper than the previous video spoken of earlier.  The audience, his band, and everyone else involved in the concert did indeed make this 1 hour and 45 minute show ""Live and Clear"".It deserves respect and to be owned.",975110400,9,956,5.141935483870967
1359276,5,B00004W191,"Is it fair to ask an artist to play the same group of songs over and over each year? No, But this concert proves that Manilow is one of the few that can take this list of songs and perform them better with each concert. The sound and picture quality was incredible, upstaged only by his voice, which was better than I've heard in years. I was pleased to see songs like ""I am your child"" and ""All the Time"" added to his show, and was really moved by the emotion given to tracks like ""Tryin to get the feelin"" and ""Even Now"".  For the die hard fan this is a must, for anyone who wonders how or why Manilow continues his concert success....they need only watch this DVD.",972172800,3,667,4.170542635658915
1359277,5,B00004W191,Absolutely EXCELLENT !!! To me it did not possess the emotion and the electricity of his first DVD release but this was still a very moving performance and a must have if you are a true Barry Manilow fan who enjoys a pure entertainer of his magnitude and presense.....,971395200,,268,4.489795918367347
1359278,5,B00004W191,"I just watched this DVD and I must say I was impressed. I actually bought this for my mother to watch when she visits me in a few weeks and thought I'd pop it in and see how the concert was. Incredible. I'm a huge Sinatra fan so I'm not the best person to usually ask who is the best anything when it comes to music, but if there is a better concert DVD out there let me know, I will buy it tomorrow! I have the luxury of watching this on a 56 inch HDTV with a 16x9 screen and Dolby Digital surround sound and it was beautiful. It is a shame this DVD is only in the Dolby 4.0 format but once Barry starts singing it's a non-issue. I do not own any of Barry's music but I will be buying some soon. ""Weekend in New England"" was so incredible I had to watch it 3 times alone. The accordion part I could have done without personally but the kazoo part I actually liked. Go figure. Go buy a DVD player if you do not have one yet and GO BUY MANILOW LIVE!",970963200,6,948,3.8666666666666667
1359279,4,B00004W191,"It came.  I watched.  My feelings are mixed.  I thought he *brutalized* the 1st two songs (Could it be Magic, Somewhere in the Night -- among my favorite).  They are ballads, sonorous, soaring. His cackling and hip swaying was total buffoonery for that music -- a stark contrast to the mood of the music.  He should have opened with ""NYC Rhythm"" or ""Copa"" if he wanted high energy.  I'm still angry about that.  By the time he played ""Trying to Get the Feeling"" he had returned to earth, and did a very nice job.  He was in good voice, though ""Somewhere in the Night"" was bumped down a step.  The backup was excellent.  The girls in the audience looked suspiciously staged as did the Arkansas chick.  I MUCH prefer him when he isn't playing to the audience, but just performing the music at the piano.  While his singing and playing are honest and passionate, his onstage antics can sometimes derail those qualities.  Fortunately, some of the numbers really shine. I also wish he'd used a real piano, rather than a synthesizer in a piano body -- which is becoming very common on tours.  Image quality is great.  The DTS sound is terrific (minus center channel).  Overall a good performance DVD with a little goofy ""Barryness"" thrown in.  I liked his self-effacing comparison to the duck profile.  He still has it (56 yrs old).  No question.",970790400,,1340,4.625531914893617
1359280,5,B00004W191,"Very well produced, the sound is excellent, and Barry sounds wonderful. That's Life, and the two Harmony numbers, Every Single Day and Stars in the Night, are alone worth the price of purchase! Great stuff!",970617600,,206,4.914285714285715

I chose this DVD because one of your customers called this one of Barry's best---and it was!  The stage and lighting was stupendous.  This show on DVD is truly one to keep.  The joy that Manilow exudes on stage is so very apparent--he simply loves what he does--and looks so good.  I am so glad I bought this DVD.,1463788800,,429,4.3125
