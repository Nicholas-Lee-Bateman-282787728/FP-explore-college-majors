2467567,5,B000CNGBW6,"I know it's very typical for anime series to recive 5 star reviews, but i assure you this series is warrented it. I have had the pleasure of viewing the entire series of Mr. Stain on Junk Alley and can assure you this dvd will not dissapoint. Theese short (5 - 10 min.) episodes are very charming and feature a new character or prop each episode that the story will revolve around. There is absoulutly no diolauge in the show, which forces it to rely on visual, situational humor as well as it's charming characters, which it does exceptionaly well. Also, the lack of dialoge means the humor is mostly simple, clean fun that can be appreciated by all reguardless of age, language, or sex.

This award has won several awards already in Japan and it is easy to see why. I couldn't reccomend a comedy series more highly, both to anime fans as well as non-fans of the genre, and can't wait to see this DVD released stateside.",1141862400,8,921,4.449704142011834
2467568,5,B000CNGBW6,"Being the big anime fans, my kids and I are, we have watched a lot of anime...and we recommend this DVD...we have not seen it yet and are eagerly waiting its release.. but we have watched some episodes on Full Metal Alchemist and Burst Angel, and they are funny as well as sometimes sad but defintely unique! I have pre-ordered it and if you want to preview it just check out the anime series stated above & go to the extras or go to the official web site.. [...] ...if you are into some wierd kinda of anime BUY THIS DVD! & just take a trip down junk alley with Mr. Stain, Palvan and the rest of the wacky gang!",1141776000,3,612,4.108333333333333
2467569,5,B000CNGBW6,"This is maybe the most messed up japanimation I have ever seen, after watching the episodes on the full metal alchemist dvds, i cant wait for the mr. stain dvds to come out!!",1140566400,,174,4.303030303030303
8099797,5,B000CNGBW6,I loved it!  No dialogue needed.  Dark humor.  A-frikin-mazing.,1428969600,,63,5.777777777777778
8099798,5,B000CNGBW6,"No words can describe how much I love this anime. It`s dark humor at It`s best recommended for everybody and If you don`t think It`s your slice of pie, try It you may like It.",1414022400,,175,4.0285714285714285
8099799,4,B000CNGBW6,"The music is obviously from inexpensive synthesis equipment (though the closing song is quite catchy), and the animation is such that could be produced in any home-based CG animation studio. And yet it is one of the most enjoyable views you can ask for.

What makes it work is its unique and gripping, even somewhat deep stories, and the sort of visual expression that you just can't look away from (there's no talking, so no need for English/Japanese alternate audio tracks, or even subtitles). Top it off with a sharp, dark twist, and you've got a recipe for greatness!

Probably not for everyone, but at any rate safe for kids (as long as the sight of a little blood dripping from ""ouchies"" doesn't bother you). A great find.",1242604800,,728,4.6796875
8099800,5,B000CNGBW6,A friend and myself enjoyed this DVD greatly. I had no trouble getting the DVD and it was just as advertised.,1210550400,,109,4.238095238095238
8099801,5,B000CNGBW6,Most of what I have to say has been done in the other reviews.  I just hope that there is a volume II someday.,1191369600,,110,3.5833333333333335
8099802,5,B000CNGBW6,"I saw an episode of Mr Stain as an extra on a DVD of some other anime, and was intrigued by it. So I rented it, and fell head over heels for the world of Junk Alley. Had to own a copy. The episodes are short, only 5 or 6 minutes long. But the stories suck you right in. I laughed, I cried...I was fascinated. Loved the artwork, the music, and the characters. Wish I could live in such a place. It's not like anything I've seen before. So, check it out. You are in for a real treat. I sure hope we get more Junk Alley in the future.",1190073600,,531,3.8363636363636364
8099803,2,B000CNGBW6,"The advertisements that prompted me to buy this dvd were 30 second tv type commercials with very lively and entertaining cg, and music.  The musical soundtrack on the dvd is incredibly amaturish, distractingly bad, and falls far short of the creativity the stories, animation, and accompanying sound effects attain.  This made the dvd all but unwatchable for me.  Very disappointing to see this production fall so far short of it's potential.",1163808000,,442,5.197183098591549
8099804,5,B000CNGBW6,"Fantastic music, animation, story and all. It's not your standard cg series with predictable plots. It's neither morbid or overly zany. The characters although normally never speaking are developed in a very touching way. Like the episode with the heavenly bird. Not going give out a spoiler but lets just say it's real touching and funny development. Eh... its tough explaining why it's good with out giving it away. So just give it a shot. It's really funny and worth every cent.",1155254400,5,481,4.878048780487805
8099805,5,B000CNGBW6,"This series of animated shorts combines a fun use of computer animation, a quirky, dark sense of humor, and an overall light tone. I would recommend this as a fun item to anyone, not just anime lovers.",1151452800,,201,4.45945945945946
8099806,5,B000CNGBW6,"Mr. Stain lives in a slum called Junk Alley with his anthropomorphic cat Palvan. He isn't a homeless person, but his living conditions are still poor. Every episode starts with Stain rooting through a heap of garbage outside his home, and every episode he finds something new and magical. Also of note is that every episode seems to centre around Mr. Stain creating life from what he finds and wrestling with the moral implications of what he's done.

It sounds pretentious, but it isn't. Despite this formula, Mr. Stain is bursting with originality, and the level of style and charm it posesses sets it apart from all other animes, and all other 3D animated cartoons for that matter. It is funny and very, very disturbing, and I don't doubt that everyone who's seen those bonus Mr. Stain episodes on the other FUNimation discs has already gone out and ordered a copy of the entire series.

Highly reccommended.",1142121600,5,911,4.796178343949045
