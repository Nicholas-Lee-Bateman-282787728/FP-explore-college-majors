8362653,5,B002BZZ502,"It was great to receive the dvd as we often say when we have a tipple ""Just the one"" and was a pleasure to watch the series again.
The dvd's arrived earlier than the stated date thank you.",1471392000,,188,3.973684210526316
8362654,3,B002BZZ502,"The only annoying thing about the box set is, on series 1, I have to keep turning the volume up and down, as it isn't consistent. Other wise I am very happy with it, Thank you.",1441929600,,176,3.9166666666666665
8362655,2,B002BZZ502,"I bought this because of the screen writer, Bob Larbey, who has given us several jewels.  This series doesn't  cut it .  It's a cheapie production with a laugh track that never stops, even when someone walks across a room.  The actors are able, but the dialogue is lame and unfunny.

This is miles from what one might expect and isn't worth the money or the time.",1435968000,,363,4.358208955223881

8362657,5,B002BZZ502,This was a fun series that made you love the cast. I watched it on TV and would love to own it. I wish they would bring it out on Region 1 DVD! When they do I will buy it!!,1389484800,,172,3.325
8362658,5,B002BZZ502,"I'm currently watching 'On the Up', and have watched the first two seasons of this very enjoyable BritCom. Tony grew up in the middle class, but has made his fortune as owner of a luxury car for hire business. He'd married an upper class woman who leaves him in the first episode because she can't deal with him retaining his middle class roots. The hired help are his best friends: Sam, the chauffeur/valet, Maggie, his personal assistant, and the delightful Mrs Wembley, the cook.

There's a wonderful synergy between the major characters, all of whom are very well drawn, and very quickly become like old friends for the lucky viewers of this show. Not surprisingly, the most vivid of all is Mrs Wembley, played brilliantly by the wonderful Joan Sims, who made her mark on cinema history in England's ""Carry On"" series, having appeared in more of those films than any other actor/actress. With her wonderful wit, and her ""Just the one!"" when having a glass of sherry being the oft-repeated catch-phrase for the series, she consistently steals the scene.

Sam Kelly plays the chauffeur, Sam, with a marvellous dryness. Jenna Russell plays Maggie, the Scottish PA, who often thinks of Tony as more than just an employer. Much to most viewer's relief, the snooty spouse appears in few episodes, as does the nearly patience-trying daughter.

The comic situations - sometimes serio-comic -- harken back to a kinder and gentler era in television (the series was made between 1990 and 1992), and are a very pleasant refresher from some of the more caustic humor of contemporary comedy, especially in the US.

As with most BritComs, a season consists of only six episodes, so the entire three seasons consists of 19 episodes (the first season contained seven episodes), but most viewers wish the series had continued for a few more. It will be difficult to leave this household when I finish viewing the third and final season over the next week or so.

If you enjoy the BritComs frequently shown on PBS, you're sure to enjoy this series. Note that you'll need a PAL compatible Region Free DVD player for these disks, but they can be had for a very modest price these days, and well worth the investment to see shows like 'On the Up', as they're not likely to be released in US editions. This and many other BritComs are also available on Amazon UK.

Very highly recommended.",1285027200,9,2370,4.78239608801956
