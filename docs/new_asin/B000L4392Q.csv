8160057,5,B000L4392Q,"A great step-by-step guide through the extensive process of professional prosthetic makeup. You wouldn't realize really how complicated the process is until you learn about it. With this dvd and some talent, making professional level movie monsters is very accessible, but you have to be willing to put in the time.",1333929600,,315,5.196078431372549

8160059,4,B000L4392Q,"I have studied prosthetics for film but as it is the area where I am least confident, I wanted to learn from scratch.

What surprised me most about this DVD is that, although supposedly geared towards the beginner, they start off with foam latex. I would have expected latex and gelatine pieces to be covered in this DVD and foam latex covered in a later DVD. The making of a complete pull-on head piece with a seperate face piece is quite advanced and more expensive since you need a kiln for the foam latex.

That is my only gripe however as you are taught all about life-casting, sculpting and preparing the mould for latex, gelatine, foam latex (whichever you're going to use) etc. The four stars are due to the use of foam latex over the materials better suited to a true beginner.",1307059200,,786,4.489510489510489
8160060,5,B000L4392Q,"If you ever decide to try out Make-up Effects as a hobby and want to go further, than this is the dvd to own.  Mark explains, as the different processes are shown, how to make a normal person become a masterpiece.  Detailed instructions on what materials are used as well as the visual guide to see it performed.  Highly recommended!",1199059200,2,333,4.516666666666667
