5991802,5,B00FGVRZR4,"Short Term 12 is nothing short of phenomenal.  I saw it by myself on opening day, then took my family the next weekend to see it again.  Needless to say, I can't wait until January to buy it.

Although one might think this film would be emotionally manipulative, it's not that kind of film.  It doesn't take the easy path, and it earns every emotion felt throughout the film.  The dialogue isn't as natural and flowing as The Spectacular Now (another of my faves this year), but the film makes up for it in intensity.  Add in some moments of humor at some of the most intense times and you have (to use a clich) ""an emotional roller coaster.""

Brie Larson should be Oscar-bound with her turn as Grace, the foster care facility staff member that is not too far removed from the kids in her care.  John Gallagher Jr. is great as Grace's boyfriend/co-worker trying to deal with her peculiarities.  Kaitlyn Dever is great as Jayden, the new intake at the facility that Grace tries to reach out to, seeing herself in more ways than one.  But the true discovery in Short Term 12 (since Ms. Larson has been around a while, just not a household name yet) is Keith Stanfield, who plays Marcus, the soft-spoken one who is about to ""age-out"" of the facility and seems terrified of what his future might be outside the facility walls.

Stanfield has two of the most emotional scenes in the film, including his somber, heartbreaking rap (his own composition, which also should be Oscar-bound) dealing with his abuse at his mother's hands and his vow to rise above that.  Dever has one of the most heartbreaking scenes also, using her short story to open a window inside her head.

After watching this film, I gained new respect for my wife who did the same job 20 years ago.",1382486400,44,1761,4.517350157728707
5991803,4,B00FGVRZR4,"""Short Term 12"" (2013 release; 97 min.) is the story of the people in a youth foster care facility called Short Term 12 (as the kids are not expected to stay longer than 1 year--although we learn that some do). The movie opens with two of the youth counselors, Grace (played by Brie Larson) and Mason (played by John Gallagher Jr.), welcoming a new colleague, Nate. Later on, we learn that Grace and Mason are long-time live-in girlfriend/boyfriend. We then get to know some of the troubled youth in Short Term 12, most prominent among them being Marcus, who is nearing his 18th birthday (the maximum age allowed in that facility) and is dreading to leave. Also prominent is Jayden, a 15 or 16 yr. girl (played by Kaitlyn Dever), who seems very on edge for reasons net yet clear until much later in the movie. Back to Grace and Mason: they try to guide these youth as best as they can, while at the same time they are hitting some rough spots in their own relationship, particularly as Grace learns she is pregnant. At this point we are less than 30 minutes into the movie, and to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a HEAVY youth and relationship drama. Only minutes into the movie (after the laugh-inducing opening sequence where Grace and Mason welcome Nate), we get right away into the thick of things, and it doesn't let up from there at all. Second, there are several scenes that will punch you into the (emotional) gut. When Marcus gets into trouble yet again (for fighting), he takes out his anger by writing a rap song, and sings it, begging the counselors to ""look into my eyes so you know what it's like"". They can't know, of course. Even harder is the scene with Jayden when she opens up to Grace and tells Grace a child story she made up called ""Nina and the Shark"", about a shark becoming friends with an octopus. I won't say more, just watch! Third, this is for me mostly a cast of unknowns, and one is better than the other, but I do want to point out Kaitlyn Dever as the troubled girl, she is ace. And then of course there is Brie Larson, who carries the movie on her shoulders. She is the true revelation of this movie for me. Surely we have not seen the last of her. Last but certainly not least, kudos to writer-director Destin Cretton, who made this movie based on his own shortie of the same title of a few years ago.

This movie made quite a splash when it premiered at the SXSW film festival earlier this year, and I had been eagerly looking forward to seeing it. The movie came out recently at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it right away. So glad I did, as I absolutely love this movie. Even better, the screening I saw this at was very well attended for a matinee, which seems to indicate there may well be a strong demand for this movie. Bottom line, if you are in the mood for a quality indie movie bringing you an excellent youth and relationship drama that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Short Term 12"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1381190400,18,3161,4.410958904109589

5991822,5,B00FGVRZR4,"In this wise and serious story, with bright undernotes of humor, some troubled teens are overseen by several young adults (very) in a residential foster setting. There is a resident therapist, and the monitors responsibility is to create a safe environment, but what you're about to witness is some extraordinary, natural, interactive therapy.  Pretty unhampered by the more strict protocol of clinical degrees, and naturally gifted with an abundance of humanity and exceptional instincts, their intuitive interventions are nonetheless very therapeutic. There are some actions on the part of the staff, however, that could qualify for unacceptable reactivity, with the strong possibility of legal consequences. Grace (Brie Larson) has a keen sense of whats needed  an attentive listen, some shared drawing, playful repartee, and fast legs to catch up with escapees. She shares, at first, bits and pieces of herself.  Mason (John Gallagher,Jr), on the other hand, is the king of self-disclosure, and often, even his most embarrassing revelations seem helpful to the kids in sharing his own deficits and insecurities. Both are affectionate with the kids, in a reparenting, unthreatening sort of way, taking their cues from the kids. The amorous and sometimes fragile relationship between Grace and Mason is prominent in the storyline.  This is a winning piece, skillfully written and directed by Destin Cretton, inspired by his own experience working in a similar setting.  All the acting is first rate, particularly by the 2 leads, with noteworthy performances by Kaitlyn Dever and Lakeith Stanfield. His rap song So You Know What its Like goes right to the heart and gut. Joe Wests score is impressive, as is the cinematography by Brett Pawlak and editing by Nat Sanders.  The film is touching, its raw, and its relevant for any time.",1523664000,2,1834,5.263698630136986

I know that it is a movie and follows a script and wants to be life affirming and that not everyone who chooses the character Grace's line of work can stay with that particular career all of their lives.

5991889,3,B00FGVRZR4,"This movie was definitely good, but I don't quite feel like it was a modern classic or anything. The standout performance in this movie has to be that of Lakeith Stanfield, playing the troubled youth, Marcus. In fact, I feel that he should have won the 2013 Oscar for supporting actor. There were fairly solid performances all around in this movie, from Brie Larson to Kaitlyn Dever. This movie thrived for all the right reasons that a small indie film should: it had a smaller budget, and therefore had to focus on story, character, and dialogue. It didn't have the $100 million budget to bring in pointless things like car crashes etc. What we have here is a very, very good independent film.

However, just because a movie is independently financed and has a small budget doesn't mean that it is a masterpiece, either. This movie lacks a little bit of something that would push it up into ""masterpiece"" territory. Don't take that as a severe criticism, because it is not. However, I just can't put this on my list of ""the best movies I have ever seen."" Something about it lacked a little zip. Something about it stumbled ever so slightly. I know that it was really supposed to strike the note of being small and modest in terms of budget and all, but there are very minor times and places in which I feel the small budget may have held it back somewhat. The sets were non-existent, and director Destin Daniel Cretton used real locations for the backdrop of this movie. That was almost definitely was a style choice, but I feel that the locations could have really told a story if they had developed the locations more and really used a production designer. The locations seemed a little too drab. I also feel that the camera used to shoot this movie wasn't the best it could be. I either think that Cretton should have gone with some sort of film and camera that was evocative of ""Good Will Hunting,"" and was somewhat washed and 1970s-looking, or he should have just gone with something totally modern, sharp and colorful. Everything in this movie looked a little too pale. The camera used seemed to fall just in between two good choices. Also, I think there was something slightly wrong with the dialogue, possibly between the characters of Grace and Mason. Either it wasn't quite rehearsed enough, or the chemistry was off or something. I also think Cretton could have used two cameras in order to get more varied shots of scenes. Using only one camera and angle made it seem somewhat cheap, as opposed to small and potent. Also: note to Hollywood: stop shaking the camera! This is the dumbest trend ever, that started in the '90s, and should have died by now. It looks totally unprofessional, and adds nothing. It isn't edgy, raw, or realistic. Use tripod shots, and stabilize the camera! I won't say that this technique ruined the movie, but it definitely took it down a half notch.

I realize that I have spent most of this review talking about the things that came up short, but really, I have mostly good things to say about this film. It tells a very nice, personal story that knows what it is, and doesn't try to be bigger in a fake kind of way. In that way, it succeeds like ""Good Will Hunting."" Although I am not necessarily getting the urge to tap people on the shoulder and tell them they have to see this movie, I think people will be quite happy if they see ""Short Term 12.""",1513382400,2,3392,4.5499181669394435

5991962,5,B00FGVRZR4,"Amazing film.  This movie captures the hermetic, strange, painful, troubling world of a residential  institution for troubled youth. I have worked in a similar facility and I believe that this movie really nails the way in which a place like this becomes an entity all its own with its own rules and character and reality.  Short term 12 is its own world and the people who reside there are simultaneously cut off from the outside world and attached by quirky and generally disappointing bonds to that outside world. This film also faithfully coveys the ways that a person who works in this type of setting is molded by the experience and bound to the peculiar world within the walls. The movie has humorous and absurd aspects but makes clear that many of the kids are there, to a great extent, because of the dismissiveness and callousness of the adults in their outside worlds who failed to nurture and protect the kids.",1471132800,,922,4.714285714285714

I had wondered how casting had found Larson as the lead for ""Room"" (for which Larson, really with no real competition. won a best actress Oscar). In ""Short Term 12,"" Larson gives a complex layered performance which is just a prelude to her stellar turn as ""Ma"" in ""Room.""

5991968,5,B00FGVRZR4,"A raw and heady drama that doesn't lose touch with its humanity or delve so far into the somber material that it feels like a drag. In a performance that catapulted her to greater visibility, Brie Larson plays Grace, supervisor-cum-therapist to a small houseful of troubled youths. Grace seems to know the right approach to penetrating even the sturdiest veneer, but that understanding stems from similar incidents in her own past that she's never truly addressed. It can often seem easier to show others the way than to do the same for yourself, I suppose. Surrounding Larsen is an excellent set of supporting efforts, helmed by John Gallagher Jr. as her big-hearted secret boyfriend/coworker, but the real show-stealers are the kids themselves. Each touched with a turgid, tragic set of challenges all their own, they succeed at portraying mistrust, resentment, anger, helplessness... and, strikingly, an innate sense of community. Their complexities are the keys to this story, gateway to a dark world that many of us would never dare to explore on our own. Efficient, emotional, intense but not oppressive - tension-breakers arrive in all the right moments - this was a wonderful surprise, and something that's bound to stick with me for some time.",1467849600,,1252,5.11219512195122

This takes film making back to its roots. The cinematography is beautiful (Watch how the frame narrows on the kids as they become closer to confronting their past, then goes wide as they are reminded of happiness and love. i.e the freedom of the big frame) and the pacing is exactly between too short and too long. It walks that fine line wonderfully, giving each story the necessary time to unfold. The acting was effortless and the story makes you laugh and cry at the same time. It does talk about abuse so be warned if that is a sensitive topic. It follows children in the foster care system so it does touch on the horrors that would force the kids to leave their parents.

This movie is pure, raw real life. I volunteer with ""at-risk"" jr high and high school kids and this movie had me bawling and nodding the entire time. So many people write these kids off with their attitude and their anger but to see someone actually portray the real stuff just blows my mind. This is what we see day in and day out and it is HARD. but there is nothing more worthwhile than investing in these kids who've been dealt a terrible hand and learning about ourselves in the process.
The rap by Marcus where he sang ""look into my eyes so you can see what its like, to live a life not knowing what a normal life's like""
just, wow. this is almost every kid who walks through our doors and I am SO happy to see that this has been produced for more people to experience and get a look inside our youth centers. I am praying more people will be called up to serve the youth in their communities, I hope this movie breaks your heart and convicts you. Because I can tell you I have spent 7 years with kids deemed ""under-privileged"" and this is real. It gets this bad and worse and there is nothing these kids need more than ONE person to stand up in each of their lives and love them. There are never enough volunteers, never enough free-time to have one adult investing in one kids life. Trust me. The value of a mentor in a kid's life will change it. It changed my life and influenced me to start volunteering and sharing in the same way I was led to Christ by the gospel many years ago.

I can also say, it will not be easy. I have been mentoring one girl for 2 years now and it is still a battle with attitude, and silent treatment and anger, but there are also days when we learn to cook new meals, and talk about how much Jesus loves us, and watch ""legally blonde"" haha. she knows I love her and support her and I have her back. That is something that is invaluable to these kids.

So anyway, watch this movie. I hope it mobilizes you to get out there and help the youth in your community. There truly is no greater investment than our future generation.",1433376000,,2124,4.1654501216545015

5992162,4,B00FGVRZR4,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Short Term 12""

1. This movie hit me right in the feels. It was one of the most overlooked films of 2013.

2. It's about a group of 20-something adults working in a group home for troubled teenagers. One of the workers, Grace, bonds with a new girl, Jayden. Their relationship triggers problems in Grace's past, and she has trouble maintaining the boundaries between Jayden's situation and her own.

3.  It was written and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who based it on his own experiences working in a group home.

4. It's a very authentic movie (mostly), and does an excellent job of showing what it's like to work with kids who have slipped between society's cracks, or who have been dealt a terrible situation in life.

5.  While the major focus is on Grace, it is really kind of an ensemble story. The movie follows three adult workers, and several kids. They all are connected in different ways, and the movie does a good job of showing how an incident in one life can reverberate among the others.

6. The acting is superb all around. The characters are believable, realistic, and illustrate life's tragedies without becoming melodramatic. Brie Larson is absolutely amazing as Grace, the adult that's just as traumatized as the kids she works with. She should have won an Academy Award.

7. There is technically a main climax to the movie; but since the story involves several kids in various situations, there are several ""mini-climaxes"" spread throughout the film as we follow their subplots. The movie swings your emotions from hope to heartbreak several times.

8. This is one of the best illustrations I've ever seen of the difficulty of maintaining a professional perspective in highly emotional situations. It also helps explain why some people are attracted to such a difficult job.

9. Without giving any major spoilers away, I HATED the ending. It betrayed all the realism of the rest of the movie, and it's disrespectful to the troubled kids stuck in the system. The last five minutes should not have been filmed.",1425081600,,2064,4.818696883852692

5992186,1,B00FGVRZR4,"This movie is an expansion of a shorter 22 minute version, also directed and written by Destin Daniel Cretton and is also available on the DVD. The movie made a paltry 1 million dollars at the box office in 2013 and there is a reason for that. The story moves at an excruciatingly slow pace.

The story about twenty-something staff members at a foster care facility for troubled teens didn't work for me because it feels written. It's also unnecessarily abhorrent. The movie begins with a disgusting story about what happens on a bus. Later on, one of the troubled teens spits on a staff member and it's pretty graphic and gross. The profanity in the movie, and there's lots of it, appears to be for shock value and nothing more.

The dialogue feels written. The characters feel written. The relationship between the supervisor and her co-worker feels contrived. She's pregnant. He wants to marry her. She just wants an abortion. That's about it. There is nothing really unique about their relationship and it never really develops.

Each troubled teen gets only a few moments on the screen and then we're focused on the next troubled teen. As a result, character development is minimized and we never fully understand these young people as much as we would like to.

We've all heard the expression that less is more. This 97 minute version of a 22 minute film is proof that sometimes more is less.",1412467200,,1398,4.717213114754099

5992188,5,B00FGVRZR4,"I saw Short Term 12 last year but with it being recently added to Netflix instant I thought it would be a good time to revisit this wonderful little film. This is a very simple character driven story that speaks to the truths of being a young adult in an honest unflinching way that is sadly rare. Most films condescend to teenagers and handle their stories in a shallow manor that feels false.

Most of the film is set in a foster-care center for wayward teenagers and is based on the real life experience of Writer/Director Destin Danel Cretton. The film opens with an amusing story being told by Mason (John Gallagher Jr) a veteran employee who is helping a new employee understand how unpredictable his new job will be. Grace (Brie Larson) is a young counselor barely older than the children in her care. She is profoundly empathetic to the residents of the facility and does everything in her limited power to bring some comfort to their chaotic lives.

This film doesn't deal with life or death stakes on global level. You will not see giant robots manipulating alternative fuel sources to make bombs to blow up a national monument. No, this is a film with real stakes. Emotionally grounded, real world stakes that anyone can relate to. The film itself is not glossy or filled with any fluff it is bare bones and raw. Characters make poor choices and say things that hurt the ones that try to help them. Its not often I'm moved to tears when watching a film. Ok, that last sentence was a flat out lie. I cry very easily. Sometimes I cry at films that aren't very good. That's just who I am. Where was I? Oh yeah, Somewhere around the one hour mark I could feel this story underneath my skin. It had gotten to me and I was emotionally invested in its characters. When I give into a movie like this a small part of me gets nervous, I continue with trepidation because I've seen far too many films fall apart in the final reel. This is not one of those films. You can enter it with an open heart and it will not let you down. I was deeply moved by this film the first time I saw it and it held up wonderfully to the second viewing.

Brie Larson is simply one of finest young actors working today. With films like 21 Jump Street, Short Term 12, The Spectacular Now and television appearances on Community and The League she has shown great range and skill for such a young actress.

5992207,3,B00FGVRZR4,"Much-lauded on its original release by critics and viewers alike, SHORT TERM 12 is a powerful drama set in a foster home, where twentysomething carer Grace (Brie Larson), and her fellow-workers Mason (John Gallagher Jr) and Nate (Rami Melek) spend their lives looking after disturbed or abused teenagers, including Marcus (Keith Stanfield), Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), and Sammy (Alex Calloway).  Their job certainly isn't easy: many of these teenagers have had difficult lives, and find it very difficult to talk about their experiences.  Sometimes Grace gets into conflict with her superior Jack (Frantz Turner), in the belief that not enough attention has been paid by the so-called professionals towards the teenagers' plight.  However Grace herself is not without problems: we learn that she has had a disturbed childhood - so disturbed, in fact, that she cannot even talk about it to Mason.  The prospect of her father being released on probation from prison fills her with horror.  Destin Daniel Cretton's production contains some powerful performances, notable from Larson and Dever, whose characters develop a bond with one another, despite their difficulties.  However the script is marred by some obvious implausibilities: if Grace has had such a disturbed past, one wonders why she has been put in a position of such responsibility at the foster home.  In one sequence she is shown entering Jayden's house, while Jayden is at home, using the front door key concealed under the doormat.  One wonders why the key is kept there when the family are at home.  Jayden and Grace smash up Jayden's father's car with a baseball bat, but no one - not even the police - visits the foster home to investigate what has happened.  There is a happy ending, but it seems rather contrived, as the director wanted above all to show that these kids - Grace included - could be redeemed, so long as people made the effort to understand them.  SHORT TERM 12 represents something of a missed opportunity, despite its subject-matter.",1405036800,,2018,5.066465256797583

5992210,5,B00FGVRZR4,"It sounds cliche, but I laughed and I cried (with sadness and with happiness). The characters were believable and it's easy to care about them. The acting and script were great. I was honestly really impressed.

As for the one-star reviews, I'm not sure why there is always at least one person who gives these kinds of great movies one star because of the ""f-bombs"" ruining it for them. In the real world people curse and they yell and they make mistakes. The swearing isn't gratuitous - it's in context. So if you live some sort of sheltered existence where ""bad"" words upset you, then don't watch this movie. Or pretty much any movie. Or go outside where there are any people speaking, especially younger people. But if you can handle real life, then please give this movie a chance.

Short Term 12 does a great job showing the different types of people who end up in residential treatment facilities and the staff members who work there.

They just provide a safe haven for these youths until they move onto the next phase of their lives. A troubled young girl enters the facility and throws Grace into a tailspin as she dredges up the darker side of her past.

This is an Indy film in the best and truest sense. There is no b.s. here. It's all writing and acting and it rings true to the ear and heart.

All the actors were very comfortable in front of the camera. There were a lot of nifty tunes throughout and the other production values were on par with the story.

5992228,5,B00FGVRZR4,"In an unassuming manner,  Short term 12 leads us slowly into the lives of an utterly human  cast of characters. Taken along as an observer, it becomes clearer who each person is and often, how they became the way they are. As this story builds, it never sinks to the level of melodrama or histrionics. Instead, a series of revelations about each person draws us further into the story, making it almost impossible not to care. These are people who started life knowing little love but much suffering. People who had seen the dark side of life long before they were able to make any  sense of it.

Within this quiet drama are lessons about damage and subsequent healing, about trust broken and then repaired. It is about the often unseen dimension of so many individual lives and illustrates beautifully a quote by Edward Chapin:
Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls;  the most massive characters are seared with scars.",1398470400,,931,4.75776397515528

The staff deals with each teen individually, depending upon their needs.  It is a sad and moving film but a realistic look at our displaced youth.

SHORT TERM 12 is a plainly produced yet startlingly realistic film about a treatment facility for troubled adolescents. Brie Larson (""Grace"") and John Gallagher (""Mason"") give fine performances as the young staff members who must be simultaneously authoritarian, self-effacing, firm, gentle, and everything else a particular moment requires. The way they lose themselves in order to find themselves in this consuming, exhausting job, the kinship they share with the teenagers, and the one they lack with the upper administration is ultra-real. Equally impressive is Stephanie Beatriz as Jessica, full of rage and estranged from her family for good reasons the film reveals. That being said, everyone in this film is quite convincing.

While it may be a little inconclusive in one or two spots, the plot is still compelling, with some truly disturbing surprises and revelations. SHORT TERM 12 also does a splendid job of balancing comedy and tragedy, connecting them together with various things that fall under both categories. Though plenty happens here, this film may be too unspectacular for some tastes. It's definitely not a ""thriller,"" and sensationalism would obviously have ruined it.

I recommend SHORT TERM 12 to anyone who's ever been a teenager.",1396656000,,1271,5.376884422110553
5992251,4,B00FGVRZR4,"I really liked the acting and the story was well told. A bit simplified as to the adult characters, but the kids were right on. Having worked with this population, I was a bit worried about a ""movie"" depiction, but was pleasantly surprised.",1396569600,,240,4.604651162790698
5992252,5,B00FGVRZR4,"Before I get too far I have to say that the cover of this blu-ray is misleading. It makes it seem as though this film is primarily about the relationship between Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) and Grace (Brie Larson) and, don't get me wrong, it is but the film is even more focused on Short Term 12, the residential care facility for teenagers. That's where this film really shines too! The characters are real and brilliant, based upon real people whom writer/director Destin Cretton came into contact with during his time working at a place much like the one depicted in the film. Although the film is ""quiet"" in that there is not a lot of action the emotional depth and realistic feel make it such a treat to watch.

It is one of the best films of 2013 and should definitely not be missed! It has the balance of drama and comedy, handling very delicately the dark issues that these kids are dealing with but without sugar coating their experiences.",1396310400,,947,4.538011695906433
5992253,4,B00FGVRZR4,"The best part of this was the vivid characterization---the quality of felt life. The best moments were when the kids were just trying to figure out and convey who they were.

5992257,5,B00FGVRZR4,"I worked in Mental Health for 44 years and have closely followed Hollywood's efforts to capture various aspects of psychiatric treatment at given points in history. Clearly, ""American Horror Story: Asylum"" broke new ground on all sorts of fronts in a very dramatic way. But in a quieter, simpler, more human vein, this film just speaks volumes about those who show up each day and do their best to provide care for those in need. The acting is first rate, the character arcs ebb and flow with great finesse, and the back stories are all quite believable without being voyeuristic. There is great insight in regards to how patients and staff alike end up in the overall mix that we call Mental Health Treatment..

If you watch the original short film included on the DVD I think you'll gain an appreciation for just how much benefit ongoing hard work and guidance can produce for a first time screenwriter. The amount of growth achieved in the overall project, front to back, is simply remarkable. Kudos to all involved!",1395878400,,1019,4.757062146892656

It's one of those films that flew under the radar of all the Academy Award buzz but easily could have earned some kind of award or at least nomination. It has this small budget, indie feel to it, but excellent performances all around by Brie Larson and Kaitlyn Dever and the rest of the supporting cast really strengthened a good script. It's heartbreaking, but it's cute and also heartwarming; and you really feel for the characters. It's #3 on my Top 10 movies of the year list!",1395360000,,514,4.537634408602151

Many of these kids have psychological and/or emotional issues, understandably so, and they are being supervised by a group of well-meaning twentysomethings bent on helping these kids but who also are dealing with issues of their own.

Originally a 20-minute short by Destin Daniel Cretton that won the South by Southwest Grand Prize in the short film category a couple years back, this full-length film is well acted, with realistic dialogue and portrayals. It's easy to fall for the multidimensional characters.

Really powerful script.",1393977600,,320,4.5344827586206895
5992287,4,B00FGVRZR4,"Director/writer Destin Cretton expands on his 21 minute film from 2008 of the same name, and delivers a powerful film with some great young actors.  The title references a foster care facility that houses ""at risk"" teens until they are 18.  The caretakers are young adults not much older than those they supervise.

In a wonderful performance, Brie Larson (""The Spectacular Now"") is the senior staff member.  She has a not so secret relationship with Mason (John Gallagher Jr., TV's ""The Newsroom""), another staffer.  Most of the kids here seem well settled in the home, but there are a few, of course, that stand out, either needing additional psychological help or something else.  When Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever, also from ""The Spectacular Now"" and TV's ""Justified"") shows up, Grace (Larson) sees something of herself in the girl.  As time goes on she suspects abuse which brings out hidden memories of her own.

Discovering that she is pregnant, Grace and Mason want to get married, but repressed feelings continue to hamper their relationship.  This could have been one of those straight to DVD or commercial TV shlockfests, but this movie feels very real.  Shot with handheld cameras throughout much of the film, the scenes get a bit dizzying at times.  But the film has honest emotion, fine humor and some terrific performances, especially from the young women.  I suspect they will be around for some time.  Highly recommended.

There is nothing wrong with the Blu ray transfer which comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Granted the transfer seems a bit dull at times but I think most of this is due to the clothing worn by the actors and the somewhat basic surroundings of the home.  Detail is fine and everything is sharp most of the time.  There are some inconsistencies which seem to be the camera focus as much as anything.  There's nothing to complain about with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless audio track either.  Certainly nothing spectacular which is to be expected.  The dialog is clear and clean.  The film comes with subtitles in Spanish, French and English SDH.  Extras include a behind the scenes piece, another entitled ""Making the Music,"" some deleted scenes, the original short film, and a few trailers.",1393804800,,2257,4.915343915343915

Not a fan of his earlier films, as they were not my cup of tea, However, Daniel has become much better with his character development, pacing and drawing out better performances from his actors.  HIs mood is good throughout this film and he does an excellent job of displaying the complicated relationships and characters that work and these facilities.  For those that don't think that this is realistic, well, it might not be at your facility.  The director has actually worked at one of these types of facilities in the past and he does know about these people and children.  Having worked at one myself I thought he was pretty spot on with everything.  Honestly though it was neat for me to see how Daniel is developing his style by making a movie I wouldn't normally like into something that I could relate to and enjoy each of the  character relationships and their development as it went.  It's not the best movie in the world there were some dry spots for me and at times it was a bit overly emotional.  That's just me though.  I'd recommend it though because it gives an accurate glimpse of group homes and the complex relationships that develop in them. Check out his other films and you'll see that this guy will hit something big soon enough.  Great movie Dan!",1393459200,,1416,4.624

Grace is an worker at a Group Home for teenagers. We are introduced to her co-workers: Jessica, Nate, and Mason who is also Grace's boyfriend. Soon we see kids: Marcus, who has a talent for making words rhyme, Luis who has a knack for trouble, Sammy who tries to runaway from time to time, and finally Jayden a troubled girl with a gifted artistic ability.

I will start by saying I wish Brie Larson had been nominated at least for a Golden Globe award. As Grace, she embodies the qualities of dedication, and resilience so well, that it is almost hard not to believe she is not a case worker in real life. And as for the kids involved, they get the stamp of approval just as well. A few times during the movie I was moved to tears, while other times I found myself delighted.

Short Term 12 has great acting, great direction and a positively believable story line behind it. I stand by this movie wholeheartedly, so without question or thought Short Term 12 is:

5992319,5,B00FGVRZR4,A quietly unpretentious movie that provides a realistic and compassionate look at the abused and unwanted children and the people who devote their lives to caring for them,1392422400,,171,5.142857142857143
5992320,5,B00FGVRZR4,"If youve not yet learned it, you will soon enough: each one of us is deeply affected by the pain of our past.  Whether teased at school, the product of a broken family, a victim of abuse, or you suffered some other traumatic experience  the severity is almost irrelevant, because in your eyes at the time, it was everything.

Most of us do our best to move beyond the pain, hiding it, ignoring it, covering it over with a shiny, hard shell.  Its only natural.  What use is it, we wonder, to trudge up our past?  To expose ourselves to the pain once again?  Better to leave the past back where it belongs.

For a time, that strategy seems to work well enough.  But then something unexpected happens, and suddenly emotions and memories we thought had disappeared come flooding back.  Because the truth is, they never really went away.  They were always in the background, surreptitiously influencing us.

Until we process our past, it will continue to hold sway over who we are in the present.

Short Term 12, a SXSW award-winning film, explores this sensitive territory with remarkable realism and depth.

The story focuses on Grace, a twenty-something supervisor at a foster-care facility, and her boyfriend, Mason.  Together, they balance the line between stern parents and caring friends to a dozen troubled youth.  Outside of work, they're quirky lovers planning a life together.

It quickly becomes obvious, though, that Grace suffers from her own hidden past.  When she discovers shes pregnant, she secretly schedules an abortion.  Later, as she and Mason share an intimate moment, she slaps him in a flash of rage.  As much as Mason tries to get Grace to open up, she refuses, preferring instead to pour her life into the kids.

Everything changes with the arrival of Jayden, a confident and detached teenage girl sent to the facility for a short term stay.  As Grace naturally connects with Jayden, hints of Graces own tumultuous past make their way to the surface.  And when Jayden finally lets down her guard, uncovering her wounds in a heartbreaking childrens story, Grace is forced to confront her own past.

Both light and heavy, Short Term 12 beautifully and courageously illustrates the importance of expressing the pain weve suffered, whether through art, conversation, or counseling.

Instead of avoiding the difficult, awkward issues, it engages them.  Abuse, drugs, cutting, pregnancy, suicide, murder, confronting authority  the film doesnt pull any punches.  Through a strong, yet natural storyline and broken, yet likable characters, it reaches into your heart and delivers a profound message of hope.

Without a doubt, its a deeply unsettling film  you won't remain the same after watching it.  And for that precise reason, it should be required viewing for everyone.  Because no matter who you are or what youve been through, were all victims of our past. And at some point, we all need to face it.

5992322,5,B00FGVRZR4,Great movie and was not what I expected at all.  I hadn't heard anything about the movie prior to purchasing the blu ray and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a really good movie.,1392163200,,177,4.5
5992323,5,B00FGVRZR4,This is a great independent film! It moves along at the right pace and tells an awesome story.  The characters are really well developed.,1392076800,,137,4.708333333333333
5992324,5,B00FGVRZR4,The acting was superb and the characters well developed.  It really pulled you  into the goings on of the members of the house (both staff and residents) and the struggles they faced.  Very good portrayal of life and the challenges faced by both.  This movie was recommended to me by someone else & I'm glad I watched it.  My only complaint is that there were a few scenes that were a little over dramatic and not realistic.  A bit of typical Hollywood.  However these were minor.,1391990400,,480,4.511627906976744
5992325,5,B00FGVRZR4,One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I finished watching it for the only to rewind and watch it again.,1391990400,,107,3.8636363636363638
5992336,5,B00FGVRZR4,"When you see enough movies, it becomes pretty easy to categorize most of them into something simpler to describe them to people who you want to see the film. A movie like Rush could be a ""sports movie"" or a ""rivalry drama"" or ""biographical character study"" depending on who you're trying to convince. Likewise, Forrest Gump can be a ""movie about the human spirit"", or a ""grand adventure"", or a ""tale of the undying power of love."" It's simplistic but it helps to really describe a movie without barraging friends and family with a full spoiler-laden review

Short Term 12 is one of those rare films that, much like its characters, really causes hesitation when trying to describe it, and it's brilliant for that. I've noticed (some very good) reviews that call it a ""youth and relationship drama"" and an ""emotional rollercoaster"", and they're certainly right, but it's hard for me to justify those terms because this movie just feels so much more earned than most other movies. The hardest moments aren't gratuitous or sudden, and they're not overwrought and that telegraphed, but they're presented in a naturalistic, beautifully heartbreaking way to where you don't feel angry or sad for the characters, but you feel that way with the characters.

As has been said by others, Short Term 12 focuses on the stories of the staff and youth that are part of an at-risk foster care facility. Typically through the eyes of Grace (Brie Larson), but occasionally through the filters of Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) or Nate (Rami Malek), you're introduced to both the other staff members and the kids at the facility. The film focuses on Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) and Marcus (Keith Stanfield), a resident on the way in and a resident on the way out respectively.

For such a short movie, they do an exceptional job at developing several characters at a believable but rapid pace. The Grace, Jayden, and Marcus you see at the beginning of the movie are not the same as you see at the end, and you grow along with them. It's an emotional time bomb that never really feels overwrought or fake for the sake of drama. If anything, the adults are a little too grounded in response to what they see (Grace is superhuman for much of the movie), but it's almost necessary to help balance out the turmoil in the home and personal life itself.

There are flaws of course: Nate is underdeveloped and a little cartoonish relative to everyone else, and some of the other kids/staff are merely set pieces, but those are small complaints.

Interestingly, the movie shares a couple actors with another ""Best Of 2013"" movie, the exceptional ""The Spectacular Now"", which felt similarly honest and fresh, although ST12 really delivers a more hearty, serious, and powerful story throughout. Larson (in both movies) and Stanfield deliver award-caliber performances in ST12 and it's honestly worth watch for anyone who likes movies, period. It's gutwrenchingly painful at times, and absolutely beautiful in others, and puts other movies in its field to shame.",1391990400,7,3022,4.89453125
5992337,5,B00FGVRZR4,"I sort of stumbled upon this film and decided to give it a whirl. I'm glad I did! It has the unique quality of being both sad/moving and charming/funny at the same time- which I think a lot of movies aim for, but few truly grasp.",1391904000,,229,4.0

5992340,4,B00FGVRZR4,"I think it was a great movie, besides the ending. It also is one of those movies that you should probably watch twice to really get the full story.  I did not enjoy the ending because I feel as if it just ended. There was a lot going on with the characters Grace and Jaden and it just ended with no explanation as to how things turned out. But other then that I enjoyed it. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 99% which I do not agree with. If I was to rate it id give it a 65-70%...just my opinion",1391644800,,488,3.88

5992356,5,B00FGVRZR4,Too bad this movie didn't make a bigger splash but I can't wait to see it grow over the years as other classics have. Some of the best performances I have seen in a long time with a story that just keeps you in your seat.

Brie Larson did a phenomenal job, as did the supporting actors. These were flawed, scared characters that took me on a journey into their world, where I became heavily invested in them, particularly Larson's character. The subject matter is heavy but there is just enough humor scattered throughout that I didn't finish the movie feeling drained of any good feelings. On the contrary, I felt a dual sense of sadness and hopefulness, which to me says that the movie portrays real, honest human interactions and emotions - always a plus in my opinion.

5992370,4,B00FGVRZR4,"A 'home' for at risk teens does not at first glance seem to be the place for a film that explores raw emotions in such a natural manner as this film depicts. The director/writer, Daniel Cretton worked in such a place, and knows of what he writes.

Grace, played brilliantly by Brie Larson, is the chief counselor so to speak. She has her eyes on all the kids, and seems to be able to deal with the emotional and physical outbursts all at once. Her boyfriend, Mason, played by John Gallagher, Jr is also perfect for this job. BTW, Gallagher has a strong role in the HBO series, 'The Newsroom', see if you can figure that one out. Both Grace and Mason come from great dysfunction as you soon learn. The participants in this home all have issues as you would expect. We come into the picture when one of them will be turning 18 and leaving the facility soon. At the same time, a very troubled young woman comes to the facility that takes everyone's time and attention.  To use the cliche, 'on a roller coaster' is very true of this film. Raw emotions surface, again and again, and you will find yourself on the verge of tears.

The acting is superb in this film. Each character gives much, and we take it all in. We think we know what some of our fellow citizens go through in their life, but we don't.  Many of us are sheltered, and many of us don't want to know.

What really stands out are the actors.  They're natural, understated and perfectly cast.  Kudos to the director.  It's not for children - they probably wouldn't be interested or understand the level of trauma being portrayed, but it's perfect for anyone over 17.  Actually, I suppose almost all teenagers might find it compelling, unless they're only into action movies.  I give this 2 thumbs up and a loud round of applause.

5992387,4,B00FGVRZR4,"It's difficult to be critical of films of this nature because they are noble in purpose and tackle subjects that Hollywood is reluctant to touch.  In a nutshell this film is an excellent depiction of the lives of emotionally scarred teenagers who live in state sponsored group environments and the people whose job it is to supervise them.  If the film focused exclusively on the children and their plight I would have no nits to pick.  What gave me pause is what I felt was a plot contrivance involving a supervisor named Grace played by Brie Larson, who is quite good, whose life becomes emotionally undone when a teenage girl is admitted to the facility whose past mirrors her own.  It's quite obvious that Grace is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and the question I ask myself is why is she in her obviously diminished capacity caring for vulnerable children?  Judging from the understandably overwhelming positive response to this film you would ask me why quibble but it's hard to overlook this aspect when probably half the film is devoted to it.  The next question you would ask me is would I recommend this film and the answer is a definitive yes and most definitely for teens but with a proviso for a discussion afterwards.",1390348800,,1237,4.67741935483871

5992394,5,B00FGVRZR4,"Sometimes those little films you didn't see coming will actually come out of nowhere and blindside you, take you by surprise by taking for a ride you don't want to come down from.  Short Term 12 was that kind of film for me.  I didn't believe it had the power to do what it did, and I didn't feel like I would fall for it as hard as I did.  The premise felt very clich, a little too clich for my own taste.  I expected this to be something forced, something manipulative and even worse, something derivative of something else.

Been there done that; now go home and write something else.

Still, the raves kept coming.  The film that Oscar wouldnt even dream of touching (I mean, the studio didn't even send out screeners, which after all the Top Ten mentions would have made sense to do) was getting a lot of outside attention, and the year was turning into the did you see that new girl Brie Larson in that phenomenal little indie film, and soon I was feeling like a complete outcast because I HAD NOT seen Short Term 12 yet.  I am always late to these kinds of parties though.  I have three kids, a wife, a full time job and a shortage of babysitters and so I rarely get out to the movies, and when I do it is usually to a cartoon of some sort, or an event of sorts (I did manage to see Gravity opening night).  The chances of me seeing Short Term 12 before it was released on DVD was very slim.

But, DVD is here, and I have officially seen, fallen and championed this film.

Short Term 12 tells the story of a troubled young woman who works at a foster care facility for other troubled young kids.  Grace is young and in love, but she is hiding a past that is corroding her identity, making it hard for her to connect wholly with others and even harder for her to hold fast to her future.  Her boyfriend Mason is patient, and with some personal news drawing them closer together, he is willing (and ready) to pursue a richer future together, but trouble starts to brew when Grace finds herself tangled in the personal life of the new girl, fourteen year-old Jayden who hates her name, hates her father and draws disturbing cartoons that tell a darker backstory than Grace was ready for.  At the same time, Short Term 12 also shades in the story of Marcus, a long term resident turning eighteen and on the verge of release.  His fears about leaving and his plight to remain safe is heartbreaking and adds even more depth to this already insightful story.

Where many films have tried and failed, Short Term 12 succeeds because it knows how to balance out every layer here.  The film never feels muddled despite having so many characters to develop, and each one feels wholly developed, even those with limited screen time.  These actors are given such moments here as well, scenes that allow them to really get into the souls of these characters and make them come to life for  the audience.  Between Stanfields heartbreaking rap, So You Know What Its Like, to Devers telling her story of the octopus (I cried so hard) to Larsons savage attack of a certain persons vehicle; Short Term 12 is not short of shocking moments of emotional connection.

And boy does this ensemble sing.

Larson has received the bulk of the praise, sure, but I honestly am struggling to understand why Kaitlyn Dever didn't get an Oscar campaign.  The pain, passion, energy and commanding honesty that comes through in her portrayal of Jayden is electrifying.  She completely owns every scene and makes them all feel so genuine, even when shes having such outlandish and theatrical meltdowns.  You know this girl, youve been this girl and you want to heal this girl.

Destin Cretton does such a marvelous job of crafting this film to be something so special, so human and heartfelt.  This is a perfect movie; a movie that comes into its own and leaves us with a snapshot in the lives of these young people growing taking care of young people, all the while trying to do the best they can when all the odds are stacked against them.",1390176000,16,4010,4.448700410396717

Through her we meet some of the troubled teens in custody and come to actually care about them but the beauty of Short Term 12 is that it doesn't do this to its audience blatantly with tried and true cinematic techniques but, rather, casts it's spell softly and unexpectedly by simply allowing us into their everyday lives at the facility. The movie also grants us access into the life of Grace and Mason just as Grace, a young woman with a past as an abuse victim of her own, seems to be grappling with some major crisis involving her relationship with Mason and her estranged and imprisoned father. The movie delicately weaves these issues into the story with an expertise in storytelling that is admirable in absence of flashbacks, voice-overs, impassioned soliloquies, etcetera. It's gathered as one goes along, the details of the lives displayed and maybe this is why your feel you are getting to know the characters instead of being told who they are. The performances, as well, are vivid, imaginative and authentic. It feels like everyone involved treated this film as the very special project it came to be.",1390089600,,1744,4.557324840764331

5992399,5,B00FGVRZR4,"This little beauty didn't get much play when it was released, but it's one of the best small gems of 2013.  The cast of unknowns,led by Brie Larson as Gracie, is likeable and talented.  Gracie and her cohort run a group home for adolescents.  The story is how they interrelate to these kids.  It's touching, warm and amusing without being sentimental or preachy.  Deserves an audience.",1389916800,,385,4.7727272727272725
5992400,5,B00FGVRZR4,"This has to be one of the best 3 films of 2013. The direction and cinematography are a little different than what Hollywood usually puts out but that's not a shortcoming by any means. This is one of those movies that you'll watch and think about days after and you'll want to watch again. I enjoy a little sap in my movies once in awhile, but this film has terrific acting, a great script, honesty and raw emotion... a little casual humor is weaved in that leaves you with a smirk more often than a belly laugh.

The bluray is a perfect transfer as far as picture, we're all used to digital HD filming at this point, usually newer films look great on bluray. The sound I cannot comment on until I get my receiver back from the shop, but I'll update this in the next few weeks with my opinion.

It is a shame that this is one of those movies that will slip through the cracks and not a lot of people will know about because this is why films are made. A+",1389830400,,953,4.145945945945946
5992401,5,B00FGVRZR4,"The best film I saw in 2013. The storytelling is organic, the acting is superb, this is an incredibly compelling movie. It's about the strength of both the children and the caretakers in a group home.",1389571200,,200,4.583333333333333
5992402,4,B00FGVRZR4,"I hope that 2013 will be remembered as the tipping point, when everyone realized that films helmed by female characters could attract everyone to the box office. No longer just the province of the women's demographic (a la Sex and the City), mainstream films in 2013 like Frozen and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire showed that the world will go see stories about women and girls just as they will stories front by men and boys. Though indie film is far from perfect, a picture like Short Term 12 reminds us that films anchored by strong female leads have long been the province of independent film. Thanks to a stellar performance by Brie Larson and assured direction from Destin Cretton, Short Term 12 transcends its roots in melodrama to become an oddly affecting indie portrait.

Grace (Brie Larson, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) works as a supervisor at Short Term 12, a group home for teens having trouble in the system. She has a boyfriend she loves in co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr., The Newsroom), she's good at her job, and things seems to be going well for her. Then she finds out she's pregnant, and a new girl with big problems comes to stay at Short Term 12, complicating her formerly simple life.

Many people get confused and think that wonder is the highest feeling to which art can aspire. In other words, to leave the audience asking ""How did they do that?"" I would argue, however, that it takes even more skill to explain to the audience what's being done and still pull them in. Such is the case with Short Term 12. From the opening scene, with its easy dialogue between a group of seasoned staffers and a newbie, it's obvious how and where this film is going to go. The story that one of the seasoned members tells involves him defecating himself, so immediately we know this will not be a whitewashed portrait of foster care. However, all the staffers are warm and laughing, letting us know this will not be a cynical takedown of the foster system. The camera roams around, seemingly handheld and following character after character, nimble and responsive. There's a low-budget, fly-on-the-wall feel to the presentation. We know from the beginning that this is going to be a naturalistic indie drama with some serious feel-good potential.

In moments like this I'm inclined to be cynical. I know I'm being lead to a particular emotional level, and I want to resist. The strength of Short Term 12 is that it manages to overcome exactly those suspicions. Most of that is down to an impressive performance by Brie Larson. She's the center of the narrative, and it's through her eyes that we see the world of Short Term 12 and its denizens. She's a perfectly rounded character, able to hold her own as the in-charge supervisor without sacrificing her more emotional moments in more personal settings. The rest of the cast support her ably. John Gallagher Jr. is especially good as Mason, but the teens deserve a shout-out for their surprising naturalism. The rest of the success of the picture lies with the fact that Cretton lets his technique fall into the background. Though the first scene announces the handheld indie cred, for the most part the film lets that be enough, not rubbing the audience's nose in the ""realness"" of the camerawork.

Short Term 12 (Blu-ray) is also solid. The 1.85:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is clean and bright. The color scheme is slightly desaturated, but detail is strong throughout. Black levels aren't the deepest, but they are consistent. For an indie-style feature, the flick looks really good. The DTS-HD 5.1 audio track is similarly impressive. Dialogue is clean and clear, and there's impressive fidelity in the musical cues. The surrounds even get a bit of use during more chaotic scenes in the home.

Extras start with a set of deleted scenes that largely flesh out character moments, offering 22 minutes of extra scenes. We then get three featurettes. The first focuses on the making of the film, the second on its music, and the third on a screening of the film attended by the cast and crew. The feature is based on a short film, and that original short is included here as well, which is a welcome addition that allows us to see how the narrative developed. Finally, there's a set of teasers and trailers for the film, along with information about ""outreach partners"" for foster care. There's also a DVD copy of the film in this release as well.\

5992403,4,B00FGVRZR4,"This is a film that unfairly flew under the radar this year. Most hardcore fans of film have probably seen it, while many others probably haven't even heard of it.

If you haven't seen it, I can't recommend it enough. It boasts one of the most impressive casts of the year, led by the fantastic Brie Larson, who should (but won't) be getting serious Oscar attention for her performance. Short Term 12 is one of the most emotionally investing films I have ever seen. You want to care about these characters, you really do. This film made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me the chills, and it is necessary viewing for the very good year that 2013 was for cinema.",1387152000,,662,4.382113821138211
