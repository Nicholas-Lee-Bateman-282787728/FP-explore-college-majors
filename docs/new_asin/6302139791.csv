429238,4,6302139791,"This is a very good early Western film staring John Wayne.  By early, I mean pre-Stagecoach.  the Duke does a good acting job, the cast and script are good, and John gets the girl in the end.  Production values are not as good in these early Duke Westerns as they will be in his latter films-but this is a good, enjoyable movie.",1359763200,,328,4.258064516129032

It isn't awful, but it's nothing special, either.",1290211200,,174,4.46875
429241,5,6302139791,"For John Wayne enthusiasts this is a good movie. There were plenty of big
stars including John Wayne. One could tell the limits of movie production
at the time which was comical to watch, but for anyone that loves John Wayne as much as I do it is a good movie.",1290124800,,260,4.117647058823529
429242,3,6302139791,"I'm a big fan of John Wayne.  Even in my youthful liberal days, I always stood up for him whenever my friends on the left would disparage him and his acting.  ""Forget his politics"" I would say, ""He's an outstanding actor!""  The comment that ""He always played the same role"" led me to observe, over the years, that this discription would apply to 90% of all screen actors.  The idea that a strong, forceful man of principle is the discription of a character role just doesn't register.  The main problem with the career of John Wayne was that he made numerous poor decisions in the movies he chose to make.  However, that is a flaw of his years of stardom.  He made a lot of clunkers before he ever became a star but that was his role in hollywood; the Saturday matinee cowboy hero.

I have seen a number of Wayne's pre-""Stagecoach"" movies and I decided to jot a review of ""King of the Pecos"" because it struck me as one of the better movies Wayne made during this period.  It has an interesting beginning; a ruthless man and his entourage stake out a terriotory of their own in Texas.  In the process his henchman kills a settler and his wife but leaves the young boy.  Well, guess who comes back incognito as an adult.  Some of the action is fairly decent and the role that Wayne plays is a bit more complex in this movie (he has a law degree as well as the ability to shoot the eyes out of a snake).  The other characters are somewhat less developed but there are a couple of comic sidekicks that fit the role adequately.  There are issues with this movie as there are with all the pre-stardom movies that were made on the cheap.  Things don't always make sense.  For example what happens to his horse during one of the big shootouts, how can you rely on white armbands while riding miles on a dusty trail, and what's the big deal with the safe and the salamander nickname?  However, for a low budget movie probably made in a week's time, ""King of the Pecos"" isn't too bad (but, let's face it, none of these movies rate a ****  or a *****).",1157760000,5,2042,4.31496062992126
429243,4,6302139791,"John Cleburn and his family were hard working settlers with legal right to prime western property. They happened to be on the property that the thieving Alexander Stiles set his sights upon. When Cleburn did not agree to sell his property, Stiles and his evil cronies just killed Cleburn and his wife and beat their son, leaving him for dead. But, he did not die, and you can imagine that John Jr. grew up with revenge in his eyes. He became a lawyer and a gunman. With those two talents, he eventually manages to ruin the evil Stiles Empire. John Wayne was the only one in the film with much acting ability. His two sidekicks are somewhat funny. As usual, there is a wedding at the end and JW is in it. This is a good film for all to see. Get your kids into the old Wayne films. They are clean and wholesome good fun.",1110844800,3,818,4.25
429244,4,6302139791,I am a John Wayne fan with over 70 of his movies.  I agree with the other reviews of the plot of the movie.  It is top of the line of John Wayne's grade B Republic movies.  The DVD has been fixed & the sound & picture are better than I expected.  I especially enjoyed the ending since I am slightly hard of hearing.,1109808000,,315,3.875
429245,4,6302139791,This is a simple good and bad guy movie.  John Wayne is the only one on a white horse.  He fights evil and wins the heart of the pretty girl.  His friends are of the best caliber and stick by him no matter what.  I liked it because it reminds me when good always won and life was simple.,1012435200,7,287,3.8135593220338984

429343,4,6302139791,This is one of the older movies John Wayne did. It has a great storyline and a pretty decent movie. The quality of the movie is only fair and sometimes drifts towards bad but overall a pretty good film to have in your collection. The quality of the film is more likely due to the age of the film and condition when it was preserved. If I had watched it and then had to decide if I wanted to purchase it I would buy it again. Some of these old movies will be lost in years to come and even though it's not one of the best qualities it's still a decent film,1366156800,,555,3.920353982300885

429345,5,6302139791,"Lo and behold for this high quality print 1936 b-western. A young John Wayne in absolute top form, a great plot, great Cy Kendall heavy and great ace stuntman and actor Yakima Cannut. Lots of riding and shooting and a fine, long shootout finale. Wayne's two sidekicks are hilarious. And the dialogue is witty. Take this one: Wayne as a lawyer: ""I take your case."" Client: ""Where to?"" Even the cover of the box is delicate showing the old nostalgic poster for the film. Hurray for Olivefilms who give us these great entertainments again and again!",1360108800,,546,4.697916666666667
