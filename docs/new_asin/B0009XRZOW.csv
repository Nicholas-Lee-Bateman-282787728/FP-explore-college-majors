2334749,5,B0009XRZOW,"Well, I'm a born and bred Vermonter and I loved, loved, loved this movie.  So, no, it is not just a ""Southern thing"".  It's a horror thing, a zombie thing, a good movie thing.

The people who made this movie had almost nothing to work with, but totally spun gold from straw.  It's funny, clever, well-paced, well-shot, good effects, and most of the acting while not 100% polished was 110% sincere and engaging.

I've watched hundreds upon hundreds of horror movies and found Hide and Creep a welcome relief from all the bad CG, apathetic writing, stilted dialogue, and hackneyed trash out there made by greedy clods just trying to make a buck.  Hide and Creep has humor, horror, and heart.  See?  I liked it so much I felt alliteration was called for.",1122595200,12,751,4.593984962406015
2334750,3,B0009XRZOW,"Please don't listen to Nick Harleys review being frim Alabama that obviousley influences this ridiculous decision of 5 stars. I guess Alabama don't get much of anything so this movie must be a big part in states history, i don't know.

Anyway, this  movie is very low budget which I knew. Its an Ok movie with some Zombies, with quite horrible make up, not much GORE if really none, until the end there are 3 or 4 scenes that are quit excellent FX wise don't know why there wasn't more. The acting is pretty bad the humor is dry except for 2 or 3 funny parts. In no way in hell is this movie anywhere of the quality Shaun of the Dead is. NOt even in the same league. It says on the cover funnier than shaun of the Dead , who are they kidding.

Im stuck between liking it and hating it. Its one of these movies you hate or like no inbetween thank GOD I only rented it from Blockbuster, for the price of $22  you would be getting ripped off. Please rent b4 you buy. This movie doesnt succeed anywhere , they just barely make it an ok movie with the comedy, the gore the acting everything is mediocre to poor nothing much to brag about.

Please take my opinion and rent first then make your decision. Im still deciding if im going to keep it only for the fact i have some what 40 or so Zombie movbies and this will just be part of the collection, I have just about any one I can buy except for a couple I know about that I heard are quit bad and will let them sit on the shelf. PLus if I keep it from Blockbuster it will only cost about $16 so I  might just keep it cause its an ok/decent Zombie movie proably one that i will never watch again maybe once every year.",1121990400,3,1663,4.054878048780488
2334751,5,B0009XRZOW,"I got a chance to see this film premiere at the Sidewalk Film Festival last year and I've eagerly awaited its release. A zombie attack occurs in a small Alabama town, pitting the townsfolk against the hordes of the undead. As the body count rises, desperate decisions must be made; flee to safety or watch college football? The zombies follow the universe of Romero's laws, i.e. slow moving and implacable. If you can imagine Big Fish and Shaun of the Dead having a love child that was raised by the Army of Darkness, you'd have a pretty good idea of what you're getting into with this flick. Highly recommended for any horror/comedy fan.",1121731200,7,638,4.654867256637168

I'm all for giving credit where credit is due, and sometimes even will support programs that offer awards for participation, but alas this garnishes no awards on any front. The makeup effects are worse than amateurish, and better effects can be seen in any of the Zombie Pub Crawls around the country at Halloween time, from a $4.99 makeup kit from Party City. The story line is uninspiring, or at least was for the first 20 minutes, which is all of my time that this flick was able to rob me of. Hats off to the entire crew for trying, but if you can't produce something of at least amateur level, then keep on trying until you can.

2334866,4,B0009XRZOW,"Hide And Creep""starts off right out with a pretty eye opening first scene that makes you realize you are about to watch a funny zombie movie. I know it was a good flick because my boyfriend hates these zombie comedy films and he watched it all the way through with a smile on his face! Yeah that is a big deal because the only time he will watch a horror is if it is serious and intense. I on the other hand like the whole box of colors in my horror kit. Anyway back to my review. There was a considerable and serious amount of attention paid to the story and getting it as tight as possible. It worked great. The humor was low brow, spoofy and smart. Even the actors recruited for this projected committed completely to their characters and a few took it over-the-top enough to stand out as super funny!

The special effects where really low budget-where talking back to Romeros original zombie film with the painted, ghoulish faces and few ampd up zombies at all. It doesnt affect the quality of this film at all. The director owns this story and his budget completely and with the self-confidence of a Hollywood movie maker. You can when you have a good story that you believe in and the passion to do it justice. Hide And Seek is a true celebration of indie/low budget zombie movie making and as embraceable to the horror fan, zombie fan in particular, as Night Of The Living Dead and Shaun Of The Dead. I completely enjoyed this film from beginning to end.",1432512000,,1461,4.411111111111111

If every other movie included in the collection is [junk], I got more than my money's worth. This flick doesn't take itself too seriously, but that doesn't mean it's not well done. It's twisted, it's bloody, it is oh so wrong, and it's GREAT! It's super low budget and cheesy and beautifully so. It doesn't try to be anything it's not, which is why it works. I will definitely be recommending this to friends.

2334868,5,B0009XRZOW,"A great movie I have already watched several times and will watch several times more.  A lot of low budget (well, and high budget) zombie movies suffer from poorly written dialogue.....not with Hide And Creep!  The dialogue is very well written, and the actors do so well with their lines!  This is not a scarey movie (of course, for those who complain about that, i have to ask, are you EVER scared by a zombie movie?  even the ""serious horror"" ones?), but a quirky comedy.  It avoids too many stereotypes and takes some interesting turns.  While being set in a rural southern town and doing a great job at portraying rural america, it avoids the stupidness of movies like Redneck Zombies......I grew up in rural Georgia, and the characters in Hide And Creep are characters i recognize.  If you portray people pretty much as they are, I think anyone will be able to relate to the characters, even if not from rural america (i really enjoyed last of the living, which was in new zealand where i've never been, but it had good  characters too).  You can exaggerate a little, but if you portray caricatures of people, then no one can relate to the characters, whether the viewer is from the region or not.  Different people want different things from a zombie movie, and i want characters i can relate to and good dialogue.  The effects are not what a hollywood movie can give you, but for the low budget they did a good job, but if you're looking for Romero gore you will be disappointed.  There are a lot of fun references to other zombie movies and to plan 9 from outerspace.  The tone of the movie is along the lines of Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Last of the Living (and even AAAH Zombies).  If scared to invest the money, you can get this movie on one of the multimovie packs which has like 8 or 10 movies at a cheaper price.  However, this DVD has the short which inspired the movie, behind the scenes footage, and also has an informative entertaining commentary from the director/actor and screenwriter.",1410912000,,2016,4.545706371191136

What made it stick out was not how low budget it was or the lack of gore or the bad acting but what won me over is the simple fact that for a redneck horror movie it offers non offensive gay jokes and a true rarity male nudity. I have come to accept that whenever I watch horror movies some bimbo will flash her breasts so seeing a dumb but loveable nude redneck looking for his car and girlfriend during a zombie outbreak made me laugh. Add in a poor priest trying to get his townsfolk to worship again and a group of redneck hunters who are gun crazy and you have a fun movie.

I purchased a zombie movie set of 10  combo from Walmart for $5 but Amazon has it on here as well.

(And yes, I said ""film,"" not video; the fact that the creative forces knew and cared enough about movie- making to shoot on film rather than videotape automatically raises Hide and Creep above many similar movies with bigger budgets.)

Don't expect to see the results that come with Romero directing DeNiro with sfx from ILM, with the whole shebang produced and financed by Spielberg and 11 of his closest friends. This isn't that. What it IS is a clever homage to zombie movies, written, directed and acted by people who obviously do it for love. And if you share their love of the genre and can appreciate a good parody, you'll enjoy Hide and Creep. If you don't get it, and think an entertaining film can't be made for less than $100,000,000, you won't.

You can tell the actors aren't really trained in their craft, but they must be from the South because the way they speak and their reactions to certain events are predictably Southern.  Example?  When a TV station interrupts the Auburn vs. Alabama game to call into the small town police station to find out what is going on with the zombies, the guy who answers the phone reacts the same way any Southerner would:  ""Put the game back on!""

In another part the father has to leave his home, so he briefs his teenage daughter on what to do if someone breaks into the house:  Two in the chest, one in the head.  That little girl ends up making her front yard look like a battlefield.  She can shoot, I tell you what.

2334881,1,B0009XRZOW,"Hide And Creep (2005) is an extremely low budget horror/comedy, set in the small rural town of Thorsby, Alabama, where a zombie outbreak has occurred.  The unfocused and meandering plot that follows the adventures of some of the residents, is apparently intended mostly to generate a few laughs, as the film isn't at all scary.  Anyone looking for genuine suspense will be severely disappointed by this rather amateurish effort where the production values are not very high, and neither is the level of the acting.

Shot in Alabama, the film is the pet project of co-directors Chuck Hartsell and Chance Shirley.  Shirley also wrote the screenplay, and Hartsell stars in the film.  Like many budding filmmakers, it appears that they enlisted the help of their family and friends, to bring their personal masterpiece to reality.  Much more than you may want to know about the production of the film, can be heard on the commentary track by Hartsell and Shirley.

Chuck (Chuck Hartsell) the owner of a video store in Thorsby, is attacked by a zombie, and whacks him with a VCR.  Chuck drops the body off at the local police station, where Barbara (Melissa Bush) is the only one around.  With zombies popping up all around the town, Agent F (John Walker) from the government, arrives in town to investigate the outbreak, but he like most of the town's residents, soon become victims of the undead.  Barbara calls on her old boyfriend Michael (Michael Shelton) to help in the crisis.  Barbara's brother Keith (Kyle Holman), a hunter, has managed to stay safe, by shooting and killing any zombies he comes across, but it seems that there is no escaping the bloodthirsty hoard.

If you are looking strictly for laughs, it is remotely possible you might be mildly entertained, however most horror fans are likely to find the unconvincing zombies, cheesy effects, replica guns, goofy behavior, bad acting, and a plot that goes nowhere, decidedly underwhelming.  There are some attempts to spice things up by featuring nudity, but most of the actors probably look better with clothes on.

The Zombies: These are Romero zombies. The zombie makeup could have been done by me, thats not saying much... A little gaying of the eyes and some pasty faces with a little blood. They never really explain how the zombies come to be, besides guessing that it is either a terrorist attack or Aliens... Rating of 1.5.

The S.F.X: There is nothing that I could consider a s.f.x. The only thing that comes close is when the government agent gets killed. Nothing impressive. Rating of 1.5.

The Story: A ragtag group of southerners battling the zombie hoards. Its fairly easy to follow(guessing for the southerners sake... joking). Rating of 2.

The Acting: The acting is not great or even good. At least it doesn't seem like they are reading off cue cards... I guess that is a plus. Rating of 2.

Nudity: Naked guy walking around for half the film, and some topless lesbian strippers ...

Verdict: This is a zombie comedy that isn't funny. Casual fans should avoid, If you are of the zombie faithful and have run out of other movies to watch... Why not just pick it up? There are far worse movies you could waste your money on(just don't spend too much)!!",1273795200,,1419,4.5234375

If you can let yourself ""go with the flow"" and enjoy watching two amateurs have a lot of fun making their first film, it is very enjoyable.

This movie is just such a gem.  The corny dialogue, awful special effects and rambling plot all combine to make a film you'll watch again and again just to laugh at how awful it is.

The ""plot"" goes something like this: zombies arise just outside a small Alabama town, possibly as a result of UFO activity in the area.  They first assault a minister of a small church, an owner of a video store, and unwary members of the local gun club.  They then spread throughout the community, wreaking havoc while the townspeople go about their daily activities.

One poignant scene shows a grocery store remaining open during the attack.  The manager announces  ""attention shoppers: the bag boy reports that the parking lot is now zombie-free.""

Other surreal scenes involve s lunch stop at a BBQ place which has been taken over by the undead.  We're also treated to a naked woman falling from the sky and telling how much she enjoyed the anal probe her alien abductors used, and a verbal outburst by a Coca-Cola lover who becomes enraged when he's offered a Pepsi.

2334900,4,B0009XRZOW,"We are clearly in a renaissance period when it comes to zombie comedies.  Most people know about ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and there is my personal favorite, ""Dead and Breakfast,"" as well as ""Bubba Ho-Tep.""  Here we have another effort in a similar vein, ""Hide & Creep,"" that comes to us from writer Chance Shirley and his co-director Chuck Hartsell.  They take a short called ""Birthday Call"" (included on the DVD) and expand it by actually getting to see the zombies, tossing in a flying saucer and a government agent from Homeland Security, and adding insult to injury by having the crisis pre-empt the big SEC football game on the television.

Thorsby is a small Southern town, home of the 1A State Powerlifting Champions in 2001 and 2002.  Over at Chuck's Super Video Store, Chuck (Chuck Hartsell) is surprised to notice that he is suddenly all out of zombie movies.  So when he ends up killing somebody who appears to be a zombie, he starts putting things together, using his encyclopedic knowledge of cinematic zombies (for example, he knows that ""Evil Dead 2"" was not about zombies but Candarian demons that possessed the living).  Meanwhile, Michael (Michael Shelton) wake up in a tree in the middle of the forest missing his clothes, his girlfriend, and, most importantly, his '64 Mustang.  The only obvious explanation would be that he was abducted by aliens, and given what else is happening in the movie, that seems reasonable enough of an explanation.

Then there are Keith (Kyle Holman) and Lee (also played by Shleton), members of the Thorsby Gun Club, who head off to find out why satellite reception of the big football game has gone out and run into the walking undead, while over at the church Reverend Smith (Barry Austin) is fighting off a zombie attack.  Everybody ends up fighting the zombies, but only a few get to be at local bar for the zombie lesbians scene (or would it be lesbian zombies scene?).  So, that pretty much sums up everything you need to know about this movie to make your decision on whether or not to check it out.  Something like that just has to be a deal maker or deal breaker, because there just cannot be any fence sitting when it comes to zombie lesbians/lesbian zombies.

I have seen enough zombie comedies to know that they are an acquired taste.  After all, you really have to be familiar with the likes of George A. Romero's zombie movies and able to stomach that sort of human carnage to be able to laugh at films such as ""Hide & Creep.""  My particular wave length is aligned perfectly with ""Dead and Breakfast,"" so I was not completely attuned to ""Hide & Creep.""  But there was enough laughs to say that you are looking for another zombie comedy, this one is worth checking out.  Still, I freely admit that in the end I rounded up on this one because of the zombie lesbians.  True, this movie does not have as many zombie lesbian scenes as most people would like to see (there is just the one), but that is true of any movie you can name from ""Citizen Kane"" to almost every version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" that you can name.",1147737600,10,3073,4.586837294332724
2334901,5,B0009XRZOW,"Hide And Creep is another addition to the ever-growing popular treat known as the zombie comedy. Following on the successful heels of Shaun Of The Dead, it is but another entry into the new zomcom world. Several other such films have been released with varying degrees of success and many more are poised for release in the future. Unfortunately, the problem with movies venturing into this genre is that they walk a fine line between being completely idiotic messes and actually being able to balance the zombie-horror element with comedy. Luckily, Hide and Creep succeeds in its attempt.

Hide And Creep strongly follows the Shaun format, whereas everything involving the zombies is serious and only living people are used for humor. This keeps the menace of the zombies intact and allows the everyday humdrum of life to be examined and poked fun at. Another similarity to Shaun is how the characters seemingly try to continue their mundane existences even in the midst of a zombie outbreak. It is this device, like Shaun, that generates the most humorous moments.

Differing from the single straightforward story of Shaun however, Hide And Creep, to its credit, involves the interweaving of four separate stories. None of the characters are strong enough to pull off an entire movie alone, but the ensemble cast crossing each other's paths and dealing with the colorful supporting cast worked excellently. Nice performances are turned in by all as well, and what could have been stereotypical redneck depictions has enough simple charm to make the custodian of all-things-redneck, Jeff Foxworthy, burst with pride.

The first story involves Michael (played by Michael Shelton) whom we are first introduced to with a surprising affront of male nudity. A declaration of sorts, letting you know right off that everything you are about to watch is going to be tasteless and crude, yet breezy and comfortable. We quickly learn that Michael is an alien abduction victim (the very same aliens blamed for the rise of the undead) and that he has been dropped off in the woods without his clothes, his girlfriend, and most importantly to him, his car.

Our second story involves Chuck (played by Chuck Hartsell), a video store owner and horror movie aficionado who is more interested in drinking beer and watching the Alabama football game than he is in battling zombies. He is the first person to encounter the zombies and after dispatching one in his store he drops the body off at the local sheriff's office and sets off for breakfast. To his chagrin he is further involved by the sheriff's office secretary, her ex-boyfriend, and an ambiguous government agent.

The third plot involves the local reverend (played by Barry Austin) who has his hands full with absentee parishioners, deadbeats borrowing things from the church, and worst of all his transformation into a zombie after being bitten. His portrayal is sympathetic and ironic as apparently he is the only good Christian in town.

The last and probably most humorous story involves four members of a local gun club caught in the tumultuous uprising of zombies.  The leader, Keith (played by Kyle Holman) is perfect as the gun-crazy yet humble family man. Keith and his cronies are attacked in the woods but make a daring escape. They then make their way into town to warn the good people of Thorsby, Alabama of the threat but find that no one really seems to care all that much.

These four stories cross paths several times and really give the sense of scale that was needed. There are no large crowd scenes, military operations, or massive onslaughts of zombies, but having a small cast make their way around to several locations overcomes this low-budget barrier.

Hide And Creep does have its shortcomings. The zombie makeup was simply that, just a little makeup. Gore is pretty much non-existent, except for copious amounts of blood. These are minor grievances and are forgivable given the small amount of money the film was made for. The foremost strength of the film lies in the writing. There are more innovative scenes, southern colloquialisms, and redneck pop culture references than you can shake a stick at.

The DVD widescreen transfer is nice albeit slightly soft, as Hide And Creep was actually shot on 16MM film, a rarity these days with low budget filmmaking. The mix is in 5.1 surround and really sounds clear and sharp. The understated soundtrack doesn't hurt either.",1147651200,12,4441,4.973045822102426

2334903,5,B0009XRZOW,"GREAT awful dialogue, stunningly cheesy special effects, even a chick named Barbara....what more could a bad zombie movie fan ask for? This one is not to miss. I laughed myself silly.",1147305600,7,183,4.935483870967742
2334904,4,B0009XRZOW,"OK.  I personally know several of the principals in this film, so I'm prejudiced.  But I'm a pretty fair judge of cinema, and I can write a review with correct spelling and without vulgar sexual references.  So ... onward ...

I'm not a zombie-movie fan, but you don't have to be to enjoy the zany, self-deprecating humor of this film. If you're a Southerner, you'll recognize your neighbors, your friends and perhaps even yourself in the instantly appealing gallery of characters.  That is what makes this movie work -- it never takes itself too seriously and asks the audience to do the same.  Approach it as ""high horror"" and you'll be disappointed.  Approach it as high parody and you'll have a great time.

The dialogue and visual imagery can be a bit rough at times, sometimes unnecessarily so, but otherwise this is a very respectable debut film that will have you snorting.",1134950400,11,881,4.75
2334905,1,B0009XRZOW,"Even absolutely no budget zombie films will throw some dirt and mud on the zombies to make them look better. This film was pathetic. I was expecting some rotten and gross scenes, but the only thing rotten and gross in this movie are the acting and writing, respectively. I've sat through some horrible, horrible zombie movies. I mean, I even managed to tough it out for Zombie Chronicles. This I couldn't do. It was like I was about go down on a girl and BOOM! Rotten muff. Unacceptable. This is the only movie I can remember having turned off before finishing. That's pretty bad, considering the number of tedious movies I manage to sit through.",1131148800,2,646,4.626086956521739
2334906,1,B0009XRZOW,"Where do I start?  If I could give negative stars I would.  Bad everything...characters, plot, acting, gore, dialogue, ect.  The best part of this movie is turning the DVD player off.  The acting is downright horrible not to mention some fat baffoon walking around half the movie with his 2 inch killer hanging out.  Wathcing this movie not only wastes your time and money, but it also kills brain cells.  Stay away..Stay far far away from this abomination of a film.  Being a die hard zombie fan this movie made me physically and mentally queasy.  Bury this movie and pray to the Lord that it doesn't come back.",1128988800,5,612,4.601851851851852
2334907,5,B0009XRZOW,"This is a great little Zombie flick. Despite its obvsiouly extremely low budget and poor make up, the movie remains fresh and entertaining due to the dialouge and amusing situations the characters become involved in. It's not scary, but its funny as hell, and I was very pleased with it. The low budget equilvent to Shaun of the Dead. Quite inspiring actually, this little flick is 100 times better than that PG-13 horror schlock Hollywood is shoving down our throats right now.",1126224000,9,478,4.841463414634147
2334908,4,B0009XRZOW,"This was the first film that I had seen at Birmingham's Side Walk Film Festival aka Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival off site.  All of the venues that I have been to have been located within a few blocks of one another, so that you can walk from one theater to the next.  However, when I attended in 2004 they showed this at a place called Sloss Furnace at night.  This is a place that makes metallic objects and also has various events through the year such as concerts and a haunted house thing around Halloween.  Not only this but many people believe that the place is haunted including Kathryn Tucker Wyndham who is known by many for her ghost stories and the ghost named Jeffrey.

So, you are sitting in metal folding chairs at night in this supposedly haunted place, which you are reminded of with five minutes of the documentary about Kathryn Tucker Wyndham concerning Sloss Furnace, so the mood was set.

Then the movie comes on.  I thought that it was very fresh.  There's not a whole lot of new things that you can do with zombies, but this one felt original.  It was obvious that it was low budget, but that helped with the almost camp feeling that you got from it every now and then.  There were some really funny moments in the film that I still remember a year later, but I will let you discover them for yourselves.

Rarely would I suggest that someone buy a movie without seeing it first and this is no exception.  However, if you have an hour and a half to kill and want something cheesy and fun pick it up.  I think that the reviewer Nick was correct when mentioning Army of Darkness, this film is not as good as that one, but it has the same kind of feel to it.

I think that it would play just as well on DVD as it did on the rigged up screen I saw it on, so give it a try if it is available near you, it'll be good for at least a few laughs",1123632000,7,1861,4.176470588235294
2334909,4,B0009XRZOW,"This really is a great, funny movie. Unfortunately, if you're not from Alabama (or at least the South) you won't get half the jokes they make. You might not even realize they're making a joke. Little  things like raising the price of milk and bread because of zombie attack, stopping to eat at Firehouse BBQ while running from zombies, telling the news anchor to shut up and put the Alabama-Auburn game back on and several other small things are hilarious if you've lived here.

The movie was filmed in and around Montevallo, AL and shown at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham. The music in Hide and Creep is superb and was done by Eric McGinty. Eric may just be the hardest working musician in Alabama. He also plays Ned, the first poor member of the Thorsby Gun Club to meet an untimely demise.

This movie was released by Asylum and compared to other Asylum titles  the acting, direction, effects and cinematography are incredible. Compared to most of the other straight-to-video horror movies I've watched all of these are still very good.",1123459200,8,1049,4.747252747252747

8069753,4,B0009XRZOW,"Great comedy for those who love the horror / zombie genre.  ( I don't think I would classify this even as a horror/comedy...  just straight up comedy )

Chuck reminds me of Randall from Clerks...  I loved the mention of Dead Alive ( aka BrainDead ), another awesome zombie / comedy flick directed by Peter Jackson ( yes, that Peter Jackson ).

All of the characters in this flick were done really well.  The writing was fantastic.  Has to be like the most redneck southern town in existence.  Keith's daughters ( while only in the movie for a few minutes ) were classic and had me rolling on the floor.

I will absolutely dig this movie up again next time I have a few friends over for drinks so we can all have a laugh.  Two thumbs up from me.",1519257600,,744,4.25
8069754,5,B0009XRZOW,"No, I'm not involved with this movie in any way, and no, I wouldn't recommend this to your average horror fan. But, for those who can appreciate a micro budget, back woods, amateurish, countrified zombie film that's actually shot on film, then it's a blast. Maybe it's because I can imagine the fun they had making it, being the wanna be filmmaker that me and my friends are. There is a likability to the characters, some genuinely funny lines, if you can get past some really bad post audio dialogue work. This film is flawed in many ways, but it's good intentioned, and I can see past it. One of my favorite, go to, background noise movies that I've seen a dozen times. I'm glad it's back on Amazon. I have it on DVD but it does seem more iPhone worthy.",1501200000,,755,4.361702127659575

8069761,5,B0009XRZOW,"Holy hell, this is 12 years old now and STILL better then most any of the new zombie flicks, and manages to do it with very little gore and almost no nudity. Let alone a budget to speak of or fancy big name actors.

I'd imagine the premise became around some beers and a couple bong hits but I could be wrong. Let's make a zombie flick. Yeah man, awesome. Let's make it in Thornsby, Alabama and feature the town. No s***, we can do that. Thornsby is right smack dab in the middle of Alabama. Don't get much more southern then that. I've been there.

For practicly no budget this in an exceptionaly entertaining flick. It pays homage to a lot of other flicks, if you watch it a few times you'll catch them. Most of the special effects are bad on purpose (ah, that WAS the point) the dialog for the most part is funny and entertaining. The actors although for the most part unknown did a superb job.

If you like big budget movies that you see in the theatres with your friends this isn't likely something you'll like. If you're a fan of the 'other' non hollywood cinema you might really dig this. This has been one of my favourite movies the last few years. I still occasionally catch little things and think, damn, they put a little thought in this one.

I'd love to know if they worked on anything else and if it turned out near a good as this one did.",1473120000,,1353,4.232558139534884
