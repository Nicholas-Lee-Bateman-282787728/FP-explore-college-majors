278339,5,6300247104,The 70s were the golden years of horror movies. This is one of the great movies of that era.,1499299200,,92,3.8947368421052633

278342,4,6300247104,For a movie that was made so long ago I was actually surprised at the quality of it. It wasn't scary at all but it could be because I don't subscribe to any religion so I see it completely as a horror fiction. The little boy that they chose for the movie does give me the creeps even though they only show him a couple of times in key moments. And the staff that worked on this movie have an interesting story.,1491177600,,410,4.012195121951219
278343,5,6300247104,Gregory peck is an awesome actor. The plot is great though obviously not biblically accurate. I don't like his wife she's an awful mother . all the actors are wonderful. Its sad how much he loved his wife. I can understand his pain at the task he had to perform . the music is just the creepiest ever. The little boy is deliciously evil. Fantasic movie . watched it like 50 times .,1490400000,2,381,4.232876712328767

HOWEVER, there are some great scenes in this film! I won't spoil those scenes for you, but lets just say there is some disturbing scenes and the ending is pretty intense as well... I still prefer the other cult classic from the 70's of demonic activity, which would be the absolute, horror master-piece, ""The Exorcist!""",1484611200,,487,4.674418604651163

278390,3,6300247104,"Baby Damien seems normal enough, at least as far as his adoptive parents are concerned, but as he grows older, strange things start happening around him. This is a horror movie based on Christian theology, so the monster is an unseen force known as The Devil and Damien is its son.

With that, The Omen might be a scare for Bible believers. To me, its sort of silly. The Nanny shouldve been the lead villian. Theres some interesting tension happening between her and the parents early on. Damien and his evil antics, which, to his credit, are inadvertent, are comparatively dull.

278449,5,6300247104,"*Mild Spoilers*
On a grand scale the film was efficiently catered with well established cinematography and polished set-pieces that had penetrating might, which director Richard Donner handled with precise skill. Even when there wasn't much happening he knew how to keep things compellingly tight with good pacing and impressible imagery. Though, when it came to the essential thrills, he caps off some remotely tense (dogs' attack) and macabre moments (infamous decapitation) that display bite and flair. The climax is great and the ending is a fitting imprint too. The plot is filled with shocking revelations, interesting characters and it emits a glorious amount of excitement and dread from it mysterious outset.",1473379200,,717,5.468468468468468

278457,5,6300247104,"The Omen is a classic film. It was released in 1976 and not 1974 as stated in parentheses. The Exorcist came out in 1973 and this followed 3 years later. In fact, the release date was June 6, 1976 as a marketing ploy to stress 6/6/6 (6th year of 1970's).

It's a great film and I've watched it many times. Great actors, great script, great music, and no gratuitous gore or cheap thrills. It was made to be more of a psychological thriller than a horror film. The realistic acting by Gregory Peck,Lee Remick, etc. make this a stand out film.

I already own the DVD and recently bought the Bluray. The image is definitely better, although not every scene is equally as improved. I guess there were many cameras and camera speeds used, so some look better than others. However, the improvement from DVD to Bluray is very noticeable so I can recommend buying the Bluray.

There are at least 3 hours worth of special features as well: interviews with the director (Richard Donner), composer (Jerry Goldsmith won an Academy Award his music), writers, etc. and featurettes on the impact of the film, including it's followups. This is a well done Bluray.

I was never a fan of the sequals and I cannot comment on how well made those Blurays are. I can also highly recommend the original 1973 Exorcist film on Bluray for many of the same reasons. Once again, the sequels are not so worthy.",1451433600,,1380,4.55241935483871

These events in the movies are shown as events that average people will not recognize. Very similar to events taking place in today's world. The movies are fictional based on true events to come.

278641,5,6300247104,"As the movie opens, the American Ambassador to Rome, Robert Thorn is rushing to the hospital as his wife, Katherine, is delivering their first child. On the cab ride over, we hear the conversation Robert has had with Katherine's doctor, and we learn that the baby was stillborn. Robert does not know how will break the news to his wife who will be heartbroken. Upon arrival at the hospital, Robert meets a priest who makes an unusual proposition. Another child was born at the same time as the Thorn baby, and that child's mother died during delivery, leaving him without any family. The priest proposes the idea of switching out the children, and for Robert to raise this orphan as his own, without ever telling his wife the fate of their real child.

""The Omen"" is one of those films, like ""The Exorcist"", that you know the story, even if you've never seen the film. So the big shock of Damien's origins has been lost. But what hasn't been lost is the fantastic performances by the whole cast, the haunting music, the creative direction, and even with the foreknowledge of who or what Damien is, the filmmakers are able to create suspense and provide genuine thrills.

If you've never seen the film, or have only seen the remake, give this movie a try. it's a horror movie, made for adults, and one that I can appreciate much more now that I'm a father of two. Not only a good horror film, but a good film period.",1419897600,,1415,4.5234375
278642,5,6300247104,"Great movie for its time. I bought this for a co-worker who has religious  beliefs, and he found it to be disturbing",1419811200,,116,4.2727272727272725
278643,5,6300247104,"The Omen is quite the good horror!  I'm pretty sure I watched another version of this movie (a remake) a few years ago, because I vividly remember the part with the woman hanging/jumping off the roof in another film during an outside party but I can't say for certain it was a remake or just the same idea used in a completely different movie.  I'm guessing it was in fact a remake because I can also recall the scene with the mother falling from the top floor when her son drives his tricycle into her.

I can say for certain that the atmosphere is MUCH stronger in this original 1976 version.  I would have surely remembered if such a strong atmosphere was present in the remake.  A powerful atmosphere and allowing a build-up of demonic suspense to occur is *incredibly* important to me in horror movies, and that's what makes the Omen such a great movie.  Perhaps the only downside is that the mother quickly realizes that her son is demonic in this version well before lying in a hospital bed recovering from broken bones after the tricycle incident, whereas in the remake the mother sort of brushes it off for a while (""oh boys will be boys!"") until it REALLY dawns on her that her son is the devil, which of course prompts her to freak out once she figures it out.  Basically the two mothers react differently, if I remember.  The mother in the remake is more forgiving.  It's possible the storyline has been changed a bit too, which explains the different reactions.

I don't remember the dogs being so prominent in the remake either.  They appear on many different occasions in this version, and as a viewer you often wonder how violent they're going to become at any given moment (without spoiling anything, we find out eventually!)  The dogs always seem to appear in all the right unpredictable spots.  Also memorable is the segment showing the way people are being killed before they actually die inside specific pictures that are taken.  For example, a huge sharp faded pole is shown poking through the priests skin while he's standing innocently in the picture.  SPOILERS- this means he ends up dying in the same way (even the same pole angle) while outside a church building.  This same example occurs with a few other people/pictures.

Anyway if I haven't mentioned it yet, the story's about a mother and father bringing home a baby that turns out to be the devil.  I think the original baby died and they bring in a different baby unbeknownst to the mother.  The father doesn't tell the mother about the other baby but I either missed or misunderstood this part since it occurred in such a nonchalant way that it went by unnoticed.  The story goes into the future a few years so the little boy appears preschooler aged throughout the movie.

Turns out the kid's able to make people aware of his evil side just by starring at them which can result in either giraffes running away frightened in one zoo scene, baboons turning car-chasingly vicious in another segment or encourages people to commit suicide in dramatic ways (or flat out murders them in surreal ways).  For a while the parents aren't able to put the pieces together and understand that the kid they brought home from the hospital is causing all this chaos to happen until much later which is memorable writing (except for the mother who catches on surprisingly early).  The parents never seem to question the child though and just automatically conclude he's the problem with his possession of demonic behavior, and I could've sworn communicating with the child was of greater importance in the remake but I could be wrong.

A scene I love is when the priest walks into the father's office and begs that he drinks the blood of Christ because he knows the father's son is evil, but the father just brushes him off as a crazy lunatic priest.  The priests reaction here courtesy of his facial expressions and determination to get through to the father as a means to strongly recommend his request is just amazing!  The woman who acts like the caretaker to look after the boy at home is another memorable addition to an already brilliant storyline given her uneasy spookiness as a character.  I mean we all knew she was evil too right from the beginning, but that doesn't hurt her character any.

The build-up and presentation is just spectacular.  The perfect way to present a horror script- the Omen does everything right.  I have no faults with this movie.  Highly recommended for all Exorcist and Amityville Horror fans!",1417824000,,4500,4.687022900763359

Good thing I was in no hurry for all those years; since 1976 I've been doing much better things than spending two hours watching such a silly little movie as this.  At least the ever-pedestrian director Richard Donner, who would go on to make other so-what? films such as SUPERMAN, THE TOY, LETHAL WEAPON, and SCROOGED, keeps it moving.

I must quote an earlier review, which gets to the heart of THE OMEN's lack of substance: ""There's no sense of dread at any point."" I guess the Thorns never do get around to checking Mrs. Baylock's references, let alone ask to meet her husband.

A few years ago I stumbled upon the remake of this film, which was not very good.  However, do not let the sequel deceive you.  This film is incredibly horrifying.

From the cast to the story line to the score, this movie is an absolute classic gothic horror.  It centers on a wealthy family who has struggled to have a child.  After the loss of a newborn, the father secretly replaces the baby with another child from the materinity ward who, in turn, ends up being the antichrist. The family and those they surround themselves with must come to terms with this situation when their child, Damien, turns five and strange, traumatic events begin to surround the child and his scarily overly protective nanny.  Will the family come to terms with what their son truly is before their lives spin completely out of control?

The 2006 remake makes the events a bit creepier, and the characters are made to be a bit creepier. All said, this movie is rich in plot, and has top-notch acting to bring it all out. I seldom support remakes, but I can understand why this movie was remade 30 years later: the sound quality just isn't good, and had me cranking up the volume in order to hear the lower voices at times. This is sort of annoying, but I'm not going to penalize this otherwise excellent movie just for that. This movie is a balanced thriller that manages to hold ones interest throughout.

Though many hold this movie as one of the best of it's satanic horror sub-genre, I do not hold it in such high esteem. That is not to say I don't like ""The Omen,"" I do, very much! But there is something generic about it, definitely anti-climatic, for all it's formidable actors, & a good director in Richard Donner, it just fell a tad flat in execution. Of course with all it's hype at the time, & still now in many ways, ""The Omen"" just couldn't follow ""Rosemary's Baby"" & ""The Exorcist,"" but that's a truly horrifically proportioned order in it's scope. As a matter of fact, I enjoy the sequel, ""Damien: Omen II,"" with it's equally stellar cast as much, no, more than ""The Omen."" It's just a tad warmer. I don't know, it makes you feel more for it's characters, hence, increasing the tension the film provides, & it does not hurt that the early adolescent Damien is one creepy kid! That is not to say ""The Omen"" does not have it's tense moments, & one of them is almost as good as it gets in the sub-genre, the cemetery scene with the Rottweiler's. Now here is a scene that has dwelled in my mind all of these years! Beautifully filmed, directed, this is still a powerful scene! To bad the rest of the film didn't follow suit, for we would of a had a major masterpiece of dread here, instead of a leaky faucet of horror, dripping dread here & there, but never full stream.",1376956800,,1399,4.299242424242424

278888,4,6300247104,"Probably I would have given this full marks when I saw it when it first came out. Today, (2013), I find it a pleasure to see Gregory Peck and, less so, Lee Remick, back at work with fine settings, good supporting cast, good script and good direction. Why did it have less impact on me today, when I am still quite willing to accept the walking dead, poltergeists, alien creatures on earth, and the whole panoply of the phantom world that makes so many movies and television shows still click. Two reasons, I think, at least two that come to mind without effort: first, I do not find the religious paraphernalia essential to the dramatic suspense, at all persuasive. That God and the Devil will pursue their Battle Between Good and Evil through the machinations of a little boy, a middle aged woman and a dog (dogs in one scene) just did not convince me dramatically (xcluding any theological concerns). That is probably due to the second reason: this was AMBASSADOR GREGORY PECK. The Gregory Peck character had been on top of things for too many years to surrender so easily (in my mind) to such weak symbols as the foregoing boy, woman and dog(s); along the same lines, an Ambassador to the Court of St. James, is not going to be alone in his  home with a dog, a servant not of his own choice, and a little boy. In addition, while it is possible, it is unlikely that English police dealing with an Ambassador from the United States, would enter a church in which he is present with guns drawn, it is unlikely that police on patrol at that date, would be armed at all. (No details, I will respect the sanctity of the pledge to preserve the secrets of a film).
Summation: if you have never seen the movie, be sure to do so. Gregory Peck is well worth seeing and there is more than enough in the acting and direction, as well as the scenery, to make it a good show. If you have seen it, but not recently, take a look, not only for the entertainment value it undoubtedly possesses, but to see how it seems on second viewing.",1370822400,,2021,4.403743315508021

278891,5,6300247104,"The Blu-ray transfer is excellent without jitter or any other noticeable issues. I was well satisfied with the level of detail visible. Keep in mind the film was made in 1976. Consequently a properly performed Blu-ray transfer is capable of containing more detail than the original film contains. One can see some film grain in places, but it's what you would see with the best optical projection on a large screen in a theater. The 2.35:1 aspect ratio is maintained, which is good as the film was specifically created in that aspect ratio on the strong recommendation of the cinematographer to the director, which included some test footage and a demonstration (by the cinematographer) of how that very wide aspect ratio could be used and the kinds of results it could deliver visually. Original film audio was monaural. A little surprising that it wasn't stereo, but many films were still monaural in the mid-1970's. Disc includes the original mono sound track in English as an option, but the playback default is the original mono remastered into DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which is well done, containing significant audio details, some of which would not likely have been heard when the film was originally shown in theaters. I'm well satisfied with the Blu-ray.

The acting and chemistry between Gregory Peck and Lee Remick is outstanding. The ""Damien"" actor employs subtle evil and ominous facial expressions at key points that punctuate the immediately preceding scene(s). The film's editing and pacing steadily heighten the dread and horror as the plot unfolds. The weakest member of the main cast is the nanny, but even she delivers a solid workman-like supporting performance. All the effects and stunts are well executed with impeccable timing. This film was remade in 2006. In my opinion doing that with an excellent classic that set a high standard was very risky. Comparing the two, the 2006 remake is OK, but it doesn't rise to this one which is clearly the better of the two The remake's pacing and other production aspects are ""off"" such that it doesn't generate or amplify the level of ominous horror this original does even when watching it right after viewing the remake to see if viewing sequence changes the films' effects. The 2006 remake's ""Damian"" is wooden, lacking the body language and facial expressions that continuously expose his evil nature found in the original Damian. The sole improvement in the remake is the nanny role played by Mia Farrow, clearly surpassing the original nanny. Unfortunately, her supporting role isn't significant enough to compensate for the rest. Between the two, go for this one, the original 1976 Omen with Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. Once you've seen it, you don't need to bother with the remake. The only point in doing so would be an exercise in comparing the various characters' acting, and the synergy between them. You won't see anything new or original. It's as if they pulled the script from the archives, dusted it off, and shot it all over again with new cast and crew.

It's interesting to note the director, Richard Donner, even now does not characterize this film in the ""horror"" genre, but as a mystery thriller, akin to Alfred Hitchcock's films, but with theological subject matter. He has stated he has deliberately left open the possibility that Thorn (Gregory Peck) suffers a paranoiac, delusional mental breakdown from merely coincidental events, coming to eventually believe his son is an anti-Christ. In terms of the film's content, if its POV is ambassador Thorn's and his perceived realities, it's entirely plausible. Perhaps it's how he reconciles (or avoids) his own internal conflicts regarding making a film about Satan and an anti-Christ, and gives an ""out"" for anyone in the cast and crew that may have had these internal conflicts. There has been considerable speculation regarding numerous events that occurred during this film's production and shortly thereafter, but in my opinion it's all well within the frequency and range of what readily could occur during a similar span of any film's production with a similar shooting schedule, and size of cast and crew.",1366675200,,4154,5.036337209302325

Evil has taken a new form, that of an innocent child who is unaware of the sinister fate that surrounds him. THE OMEN is a fitting follow-up to ROSEMARY'S BABY, as it shares the same underlying sense of delusion and paranoia. We can never really be certain as to whether or not Damien truly is the son of the devil, although we are clearly being swayed in one direction by Jerry Goldsmith's operatic score and the overwhelming amount of evidence laid before us. Still, the deaths of Damien's nanny and the others can just as easily be dismissed as unfortunate coincidences, which makes Robert Thorn's ultimate decision that much more suspenseful in the end. Young Harvey Stephens is expertly cast as Damien. He is sweet and naive, and even if we are to presume that he is the devil in the flesh, we can't bear to see any harm come to him. Gregory Peck provides a genre-defining role as the grief-stricken Robert Thorn. Even in his more outlandish moments, he commands the screen. Director Richard Donner also strikes an even balance between the growing tension and outright shocks within the film. An all-time classic, to say the least.

I really enjoyed the story, it's original and spooky. The film relies heavily on dialogue and suspense, instead of jump-scares or gore; I personally enjoy this type of horror, so this was not a problem for me. It does have a slow pace, though. Fortunately, the film begins to pick up towards the end with several sequences of high tension. The actual ending was also dark and surprising. The acting was good, nothing spectacular or horrendous, simply good. I really enjoyed the musical score, though; the music is haunting and captivating, a big plus. Although I previously mentioned this film does not rely on gore, there is one particular scene that has a surprising decapitation; fans of old-school gore effects will probably enjoy it.

Overall, The Omen is a great horror film, especially if you're accustomed to slow pace horror films. As of 11/23/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, but a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre.

The Film: 4/5

Modern horror movies are very different from films such as The Omen. Released 35 years ago, the movie wasn't gory and certainly wasn't a slasher movie. It relied on creating suspense and tension and was in the tradition of Hitchcock. The characters have proper motivations for their actions and we are shown what those motivations are. It justifies some of the difficult choices made by Robert Thorn (Peck) as he learns the truth about his son.

Director Richard Donner's next movie was Superman, but The Omen, was easily the biggest project of his career at that point. Peck's involvement proved to be a huge draw and the remainder of the cast was happy to join the project.

The story opens in Rome. Thorn is the American ambassador and his wife, Katherine (Remick), is giving birth in hospital. The doctors tell him that his baby has died, but offer him another baby who lost its mother during the birth. Thorn reluctantly accepts, but hides the fact from his wife. Thorn is made ambassador to Britain and the family relocates to London. Things seem normal until Damien is five years old, when his nanny commits suicide at his birthday party.

Father Brennan, a priest from Rome, pays Thorn a visit. He claims that Thorn must take communion and accept Christ if he is to fight the son of the devil. Thorn dismisses him as a lunatic.

A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock (Whitelaw), shows up at the house to take care of Damien, but the Thorn's realize that neither of them arranged it. She is allowed to keep the job and tells Damien in private that she's there to protect him. He smiles. The Thorn's take him to church against the wishes of Baylock, but he throws a fit and they abandon the trip. He's visibly shaking at the thought of entering the church.

Thorn realizes that Damien has never been ill for a single day in his life and considers it odd. Baylock starts to take over the running of the house and allows in a black dog which seems to be another guardian for Damien. Thorn tells her to get rid of it, but she never does.

Nothing has really happened up to this point. Donner gives us clues that there's something weird about Damien, but it's all speculation. We don't actually see him do anything, but things happen to others around him. This is developed when Damien and his mother visit Windsor Safari Park and the animals act scared and run away from the boy. Now both parents are suspicious of Damien.

Father Brennan sees Thorn again and insists that Thorn's wife will die if he refuses to hear what Brennan has to say. He only wants five minutes. Thorn reluctantly agrees to listen, but Brennan sounds crazy once more, insisting that Damien isn't human and must die. Thorn still isn't convinced, but reads about Brennan's mysterious death in the newspaper the following day. Katherine is convinced that Damien is evil and that he's not her child.

Brennan claimed before he died that Katherine was pregnant again, and that she would lose the baby and then her own life. When Thorn learns that she is in fact pregnant, he begins to think about everything that Brennan has said. He teams up with a local photographer who has more information about Brennan and the two begin to look into Damien's origins.

It's incredible how little action there is throughout the movie. Donner relies on the audience's imagination and keeps building suspense. There's very little blood in the story and Damien hardly does anything to suggest that he's evil. Any problems he causes could be genuine accidents. Baylock is a more sinister character and does take direct action when she thinks that Damien is threatened.

The one thing that doesn't quite ring true is how quickly Damien's parents come to consider him evil. The bond between parent and child is usually strong enough for parents to love and forgive their children. Imagine telling any parents that their child is evil or the son of Satan. The likely reaction would be anger and the parents would defend their child against such a crazy accusation. In this instance, both parents come to the same conclusion. Why are they able to see that Damian is evil? Robert does eventually question the logic when he's ultimately tasked with killing the child, but it seems too late to be authentic.

The journey to uncover the truth sees Thorn visit two other countries as he tries to piece together Damien's past. We meet some unusual characters along the way and there's a little more action when he searches for the identity of the child's real mother.

The story has a resolution of sorts, but The Omen eventually became the first part of a trilogy. The other two movies never matched the suspense of the first and didn't attract any actors on Peck's level. Peck was excellent as Thorn and the most interesting part of the story was seeing how he approached the problem.

Picture Quality: 3.5/5
The opening shots are weak and lacking in definition. Some shots are intentionally soft, but the movie is grainy and the colors subdued for the most part. Things pick up in the second half when we see more outdoor scenes. It's hard to pin down the quality because it varies so much. Some shots seem barely above DVD standard, while others border on impressive considering the age of the film. It's obviously as good as it has ever looked, so worth picking up if you are a fan.

Sound Quality: 3.5/5
Jerry Goldsmith won an Oscar for best original score and the demonic singing adds a lot of atmosphere to the story. It sounds impressive on the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track, as do some of the more subtle sounds such as gravel crunching underfoot. The track is front-heavy and a little quiet, but it does the job. I did watch it at a slightly higher volume level than most movies, but clarity was good once I had the level sorted out.

Features: 5/5

The original part of the trilogy remains one of the best horror movies ever made, but it won't appeal to everyone. The pacing will seem slow by today's standards and the story relies on suspense, characterization and acting ability, rather than gore and special effects. Well worth seeing if you want to see how the genre has developed over the past four decades.

The ambassador of UK and his wife are expecting a child. However, when the child ""dies"" a new baby is secretly adopted by the father, to keep his wife from being depressed. 5 years later, a series of events begin that make everyone doubt that this child is human. And as we all know, he isnt! Hes the son of the devil! This movie was amazing, better than the remake. From the satanic nanny, to the evil dog, this is truly an original! It does get a little boring at parts, but then something happens before or after, and the boring part is just explaining it. Also, this does have some blood (SPOILER!!)like when the one guy gets decapitated, and the dad at one point is jumping a fence, and his arm is disgustingly impaled on the sharp spikes! I loved this because it was sophisticated, not a campy slasher with lots of gore, sex, and annoying teens( don't get me wrong, I love those too)plus the characters are somewhat likeable. Id recommend this to anyone who loves those wonderful, amazing, 70s-80s horror films!",1305936000,,1150,4.507177033492823

And I am not one for remakes!. But I did enjoy it also, even if it isn't as great as the original. You can't remake film history. You can try, but it's not the same to the generation of the original film. Long live Damien!!",1305331200,,390,4.144736842105263
279002,5,6300247104,"Without question, the best horror movie of all time.  The generation of today may look at this and say 'where's all the special effects?  Where's all the blood?'  It's very unfortunate because today's generation is spoiled by blandness, and empty story lines.  Granted, this movie has enough special effects & blood to keep even the most jaded viewer entertained.  To this very day, the soundtrack (which won the Oscar for best score)still gives me jitters and can not listen to it at nighttime.  From the opening credits, the suspense keeps building & building and draws you in when you don't even know it's happening.  You really care for the characters, and yes, even little Damien to a certain extent as he is still a 'child' in this stage.  The acting, directing, storyline, music, everything is top notch.  This isn't one of those 'girl walks outside the house and gets chopped to pieces' kinda movie.  Along the lines of 'The Excorcist' it is story based & character driven with the extras thrown in.  They don't make them like they used to.  I think the last movie to scare me this much was the first 'Paranormal Activity', but this is way more frightening than that one.",1299196800,,1179,4.7254901960784315

The name ""Damien"" has become synonymous with ""evil,"" proof that this movie has survived for 30 years with the same power it had in the 1970s, when it took 8 award nominations and won an Oscar. One of the most explicit skewerings of political ambition ever created, Damien stands for everything that is rotten and unfair in government.

The Vatican begs the child's parents to murder him but, of course, the parents refuse. Later, the dad figures out that these strange occurences are due to his son's demonic heritage as his son turns out to be the devil in human form, the antichrist. The movie culminates with a shock ending that still sends chills down my spine and proves that the good guys don't always win(at least not yet). The sequels with the original actors cover that part.  If you like your horror satanic or occult, this is a movie even some Christians would recommend and tell you that it has already happened to a degree. Some of the names in the original version of this movie used actually match those of modern politicians! SCARY indeed! Movie or a depiction of the near or now?

279041,5,6300247104,"The Omen (1976), starring Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, Billie Whitelaw, David Warner, Harvey Stephens, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, and Leo McKern is a unique blend of horror and religion with a gothic yet everyday flavor.  In this review I just want to give my insight and opinions on some things.  If you want to know every detail about the plot, etc., then other reviews do a good job of detailing those things, so read those.

This movie was made in 1976, and it shows.  What do I mean by that?  Well, the cars, the clothes, the hairstyles and everything else is vintage 1970s.  This is not a negative thing by any means.  What I'm doing is pointing out something that some reviewers are talking about as far as Gregory Peck's and Lee Remick's characters, and that is the fact that a lot of reviewers have said that Peck (who plays Robert Thorn) and Remick (who plays his wife Katherine) look too old to be Damien's parents.  In my opinion, the only one of the two that looks a little old is Gregory Peck, yet I feel his appearance is passable, even with being 59 or 60 years old when the movie was made.  He didn't quite look like a 60-year-old man.  He looked good for his age back then.  But generally speaking, back in the 1970s and the decades prior, adults looked more mature than they do now.  Their clothing and hairstyles made them look older than people who are the same age today.  A 35-year-old in 1976 could easily pass for looking like a 45 or 50-year-old in today's society, mostly because of clothing and hairstyles.  I think Lee Remick's character looks the right age to have a five-year-old kid.  Remick was only 39 or 40 when this movie was made.  Plus, it could be as simple as her character Katherine Thorn marrying a man quite a few years older than she is.

How is the acting in this movie?  Gregory Peck was pretty good, but he came across as ""wooden"" at certain times and campy at other times, especially the scene when he's giving Father Brennan his five minutes.  Lee Remick's performance was pretty solid, but I found her unbelievable and unconvincing at times, especially the scene when she was lying in bed after the baboon incident and also the scene when she wants Damien to stop making noise while playing.  Generally, I found that some of the lines spoken by the actors weren't convincing enough to be believable and came across as ""wooden"" and campy.

I thought Patrick Troughton was a pretty good Father Brennan.  The scene where he gets impaled is a little unbelievable, however.  In my opinion, Father Brennan had plenty of time to scoot out of the way when the metal pole was heading downward at him, which took a full five seconds.  Instead, he just stood there and watched the thing come down at him and he accepted his fate several seconds before impact.  Having Father Brennan yell in terror for five seconds as the pole was heading down at him, not to mention the editing, negatively affects this scene somewhat.

I thought Damien (played by Harvey Stephens) was pretty creepy and scary looking, perfect for playing the son of the devil.  He is a combination of innocence and evil.  He's an icon in the horror movie world, no doubt about that.

In my opinion, the best performance in the whole movie was by Billie Whitelaw, who played Mrs. Baylock.  She was very convincing and believable and had the role down.  She was very creepy and evil.

The musical score is by Jerry Goldsmith.  It is a very good score.  The choir parts help enhance some scenes, such as in the fight scene between Robert Thorn and Mrs. Baylock.  It's a little over-the-top at times, but highly effective.

One of the things that I really like about this movie is the dark and creepy atmosphere in a lot of scenes.  Even a lot of the daytime and early evening scenes are creepy, such as when the wind picks up and lightning strikes when Father Brennan is running toward the church just before he gets impaled.

This 2-disc steelbook collector's edition contains lots of special features, such as commentary by director Richard Donner, editor Stuart Baird, and Brian Helgeland, a featurette called ""Curse Or Coincidence"", a discussion with Jerry Goldsmith about his score for the movie, a still photo gallery, a deleted scene with commentary, two more documentaries called ""666: The Omen Revealed"" and ""The Omen Legacy"", a screenwriter's notebook, and Wes Craven discussing The Omen.

The Omen is often compared to The Exorcist (1973).  Both movies deal with the devil/demonic possession.  Personally, I prefer The Omen over The Exorcist.  The reasons are that The Omen has a darker and more chilling atmosphere throughout, it's never unintentionally funny like The Exorcist is, and the musical score is always present and highly effective throughout the movie, whereas the only real standout music in The Exorcist is the Tubular Bells theme, which is only played once or twice throughout the whole movie.

Overall, this is a great package and a great movie that I highly recommend.",1282348800,3,5005,4.704597701149425

The grandson is seeing a psychiatrist and they are unable to do anything with him, so I asked her to let him see this movie, which is haunting and scared the heck out of me when I first saw it.  Evil firsthand.  Amazon was incredibly fast in sending this movie out, and this helped my friend to be able to sit him down and let her grandson watch this and compare some of his actions.

279044,4,6300247104,"The Omen is one of those movies that deal with a touchy subject for some people especially with maybe church people.  While at first you think that it's just about someone [Gregory Peck] becoming Ambassador of Great Britain, but there's more to that.  Although that he don't know that the son that him and his wife took home with them is the antichrist and don't know about it until sometime after their son's 5th birthday.  At first they are confused as to why he is acting strange as well as to why he never seems to catch a cold let alone get sick in any possible way.  While throughout the movie there are people that go about trying to warn the Ambassador about his son, but by the time he truly finds out about it, it's a bit too late.  By the time that tries to do something about it, it may be even too late for him to fully take action that what did people that told him foretell?

While this set is a 2-disc set, it comes with a 46 minute documentary about how this movie came about, along with commentary while watching the movie.  They even have a short on some of the things that occurred to the cast during the making of the movie, along with some of the crew experiencing some of weird things.

279045,2,6300247104,"Satan's son has arrived and he's not about to let his human parents get in his way.  Christian horror movies tend to have overly simplistic, boring, juvenile theological foundations, and this is no exception.  The hysterical priest is unintentionally comical in his over-the-top, Bellevue-esque rampages (I laughed out loud when he claimed that some dude named Bugenhagen was the only one on planet Earth who had a solution).  The scoring is also surprisingly terrible.  It's simply too overused, generic, abrupt, and intrusive to be enjoyable.  It seemed like every single minute of running time ends with some kind of lame soundtrack getting blared in my ears in an amateurish attempt to force emotions onto me.  There are a few cool death scenes, but they used too many ""animal going psycho"" scenarios which felt kinda lazy.  Atmosphere is minimized, there's no sense of dread at any point, and the ending is unsatisfying.  This is an overrated ""classic"" in my eyes.",1275523200,3,969,5.050314465408805

I recommend this film to all horror film fans regardless of which format in which you choose to purchase it. Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner and little Damien..how can you lose?",1269993600,,474,4.654761904761905
279049,4,6300247104,"It's amazing how a third of a century can change one's perspective. At its release, ""The Omen"" was considered a cheap, stupid, excessively / gratuitously violent horror film. And it arguably still is cheap and stupid. But by today's standards of violence, it's positively staid.

It's not anywhere nearly as bad as I remember, probably because so many much-worse films have come down the pike. This is partly due to the ""slow build"", combined with (thank Heaven) GREG-ory PECK's refusal (or more likely, failure) to fall back on his irritating mannerisms. It's one of his better/less-bad performances.

Donner's direction is little more than competent. His apparent decision was to let the material speak for itself, rather than playing up the suspense, or horrific elements. Paradoxically, this allowed Jerry Goldsmith to ""fill in the blanks"", resulting in his only score to win an Oscar. It's difficult to understand how ""The Omen"" got Donner the director's chair for ""Superman"", but it did.

It's a pleasure to see Patrick Troughton as a deranged priest trying to convince Peck that his child is not human, and needs to be offed, pronto. Troughton was the second actor to portray The Doctor, and in my view, was the best ever to assay the role. Similarly, it's nice to have the late Leo McKern as the Biblical archaeologist who gives Peck the knives he needs to slice the son of Satan.

This Blu-ray transfer is by far the darkest I've seen. This greatly helps the cemetery sequence, which was shot on a soundstage with a near-exquisite hand-painted backdrop. Donner is lavish in his praise of the work of the woman who came out of retirement to create it.

Donner's running commentary is only intermittently informative. It's typical of Donner -- a mixture of self-absorption and self-deprecation. He does, however, inveigh against digital imaging, and avers that ""The Omen"" was good precisely because its budget was less than $3M -- a pittance, even in 1976 --- and the production crew had no choice but to do everything ""on the floor"", in real time.

Whether ""The Omen"" is a classic, I leave it for the viewer to decide. But it's worth seeing once.",1263686400,2,2154,4.903846153846154
279090,4,6300247104,"Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is an American Ambassador to Italy with a beautiful wife (Lee Remick), an adorable ""adopted"" son (the perfectly cast Harvey Stephens) and a life of privilege. His life is quickly turned upside down when he comes to the realization that his son, Damien Thorn, may be the antichrist as foretold in the book of Revelations. Judging by the events that unfold; a public suicide, unexplained animal attacks, repeated warnings from a demented priest, peculiar deaths that were foreshadowed by a photographer's camera lens etc, only confirm what is suspected- that innocent looking cherub is indeed the spawn of the Devil.

This effective, well constructed thriller has a pretty iconic reputation. It gave us, for better or for worse, a character that has become as famous as ""The Exorcist's"" Regan MacNeil. It also boasts an impressive cast of accomplished actors, Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, and they do not disappoint. The film is mostly set in London, and its cloudy setting adds tremendous amount of atmosphere which is further enhanced by Jerry Goldsmith's haunting score. As expected of any film dealing with biblical prophecies, unholy characters, there is a lot of religious talk and it is expertly handled by Richard Donner. Donner manages to squeeze every ounce of fear from his actors and the chilling and cleverly executed death sequences are as gruesome as they are original (I wonder if the ""Final Destination"" series got their ideas from this film). Although it's never as bloody as the films that were to follow in the 80's, watching a clean decapitation from a sheet of glass or the impalement of a holy man in front of a church's walls are enough to send chills up most spines. There is something ominous about the locale of this film, grey skies, not too much sunlight, a colossal, empty mansion with humongous staircases that doesn't seem to see much traffic etc, all is perfectly suited for this kind of piece and this sense of dread is carried over to Italy when the action is moved over there.

Although ""The Omen"" is not as visceral as other genre films that followed and the pacing is a bit slow, there is enough bone chilling suspense here to make even the bravest of souls shudder. As is evidenced here and by those other horror classics of yester-year, Friedkin's ""The Exorcist"", Kubrick's ""The Shining"", Hooper's (or Spielbergs- take your pick) ""Poltergeist"" etc, when the right tools are given to the right director, much is accomplished. Some have stated this film, along with other classics of the time period, has not aged well or is dated. I tend to disagree. ""The Omen"" is as frightening and as fresh today as when I first saw it over 25 years ago. In fact it looks better than ever. Especially when compared to the CGI infested train-wrecks that have sprouted out from Hollywood in recent years. This movie spawned 3 inferior sequels (""Damien: Omen II"" and ""Omen III: The Final Conflict"" are decent enough to warrant a view) and was faithfully remade in 2006. Despite its many critics, the remake is worthy of checking out after you have viewed the original vision since it reigns supreme. Recommended.

The film is well done, but not in the upper echelon of the best (The Shining, Psycho, The Exorcist).  The music is very well done and has some sophisticated use of dissonance.  One of my favorite touches was hearing the chant during a suspenseful scene and then in the next scene the phone is ringing to the same rhythm.  I thought that was a clever touch.  The film lacks in some areas though.  It is somewhat slow and it is VERY predictable.

279093,5,6300247104,"""The Omen"" was one of the biggest horror films of the 1970's and it continues to this day to scare audiences out of their seats. The movie is about a couple who, unknowing to them, are the parents of the antichrist. Lee Remick and Gregory Peck star as the couple and they give superb performances. What makes ""The Omen"" stand out is the fact that things happen in the movie that you don't expect. Most horror films don't surprise the audience much, but ""The Omen"" jolts the viewer to the point that you can't believe what your seeing.
 ""The Omen"" would spawn several sequels, but this is the best. The film was shot in England and one gets a forboding feeling while watching as the backdrop of London adds a lot.
 This DVD is loaded full of bonus features including audio commentary by the director and editor. There is also a superb documentary on the movie entitled ""666.

The DVD version is excellent because it presents the movie in the 2.35 widescreen mode, which is essential to the viewing of this film if you are a fan of cinematography. I had forgotten how beautifully filmed this movie was.

I'd also forgotten the story was a bit slower than I remembered from back in '76 but still provides enough action and plenty of chills. This time around, I found the nanny (Billie Whitelaw as ""Mrs. Baylock"") to be more scary than the devil-kid! I didn't even remember her from 30 years ago but she got my attention on the DVD. It was a very effective job of acting by that woman.

In the meantime, I always enjoy looking at Lee Remick's gorgeous face with her magnetic eyes and Gregory Peck is usually rock-solid in roles he plays. This is no exception.  The presence of Peck and Remick is one reason I still perfer this version over the re-make (which was pretty good, too.)

279096,5,6300247104,"When Katherine Thorne (Lee Remick) gives birth to a still-born baby her husband, Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck), the current ambassador of the UK, replaces the baby (without her knowledge) with another baby born on the same night who's mother had died during the birth.. The baby was born on the 6th hour of the 6th day of the 6th month (June). They name the baby Damien (Harvey Stephens). The three of them move into a mansion and the all live together happily. But thing start to go wrong for them, starting at Damiens' fifth birthday party when the young maid of the house hangs herself by jumping off the roof proclaiming: ""Damien, it's all for you!"". A series of equally mysterious deaths lead Robert Thorn to discover the truth that his adopted son is the literal anti-christ - but can he stop Damien before it is too late . . .

`The Omen' is a first class, cult favourite film with a riveting storyline, a talented cast and a chilling musical score. Although this is a horror film it relies more on shock tactics and suspense than it does on blood and gore. The musical score (on recent television performances and DVD releases of the movie) has been digitally remastered with a new Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo Mix in comparison to when it originally came out in 1976, but it is still not as good as I should be; it deserves the full 5.1 Remix.

The movie has not got any one particular protagonist, although the two obvious choices would be Robert Thorne and Damien Thorne. In my opinion, Robert is the protagonist, but I thought that the latter was a better and more interesting character so I would consider Damien to be the anti-hero.

In `The Omen' Katherine and Robert Thorne are a rich American couple who move to England while Katherine is pregnant. The birth does not go as planned and she delivers a still-born baby. In order to keep this devastating news from his wife - knowing how much she had wanted a baby - Robert replaces the still-born with another new-born baby whose mother died during the birth. They decide to name the child Damien.

Shortly after Roberts' wife has a terrible `accident' and ends up in hospital, a photographer (David Warner) shows him photographs that he has taken of the people from around Damien who have died under mysterious circumstances. The pictures all contain similar oddities and this leads Robert on a journey to Rome which leads him to the terrifying conclusion that Damien is the son of the devil.

My only complaint about this movie would be that between scenes of action - or scenes featuring Damien - this movie can get a bit slow. Nevertheless, the only point where the plot moves along slowly enough to be considered `boring' is in the middle when Robert Thorne, along with a photographer (whose name we never learn), travel to Rome to discover the truth about Damien and where he came from. Even though I found it slightly boring, twenty-five minutes of not-very-interesting storyline is not enough to take any merit away from the other hour and a half of the film, which was very enjoyable.

Even though it was made thirty years ago this movie is still very popular today and is not showing signs of its age - even in comparison with today's big blockbuster, special effects, hi-tech, movies. I highly recommend this movie to any fan of the horror genre, especially if they are looking for a good movie and not just buckets of gore.",1237420800,,3394,4.629568106312292

""Here is wisdom.
Let him that hath understanding
Count the number of the beast:
For it is the number of a man;
And the number is 666.""

The above is found printed on-screen at the very end of this riveting suspense/horror movie.  (Note that the above quotation is found in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 13, Verse 18.)

I think this movie is so good when you compare it to other movies in this genre because of its:

(1) Respectability: it is a film with renowned actors especially its two main principles, the legendary Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.

(2) Seriousness: the movie plays as a contemporary thriller rather than going over-the-top (as so many suspense/horror movies do)

(3) Background musical score: in a word it's--unforgettable.  This musical score has a strong choral element with an eerie Latin chant.

Be forewarned!  This movie contains some shocking and intense scenes.  Amazingly, these scenes contain hardly any blood and gore.

Finally, the DVD itself (Collector's edition released in 2006) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.

One chilling extra is concerned with the production of this movie.  The production was plagued with a series of incidents which some members of the crew attributed to the operation of a curse.  They wondered if these incidents were due to supernatural forces trying to prevent this movie's filming.

In conclusion, this is an unforgettable suspense/horror movie.  I leave you with a poem uttered by a priest in this movie:

""From the eternal sea, he rises
Creating armies on either shore
Turning man against his brother
Till man exists no more.""

Fake quotation from the Bible of some Yeats-like poem, hardly supported by the Book of Revelation. Apart from that bigot filiation to texts that are absolutely transcending in their inspiration and here reduced to some superstitious unfounded belief. We have to go over this vision and the unacceptable use of dogs to protect the son of Satan, the Antichrist, a direct allusion to the dogs of Allah, to the Moslem creed actually more rather than less hinted at with Jerusalem and the discovery of the roots of Christianity on a background voice-over of a Muezzin calling for prayer. Then the film is an archetypical matrix for so many films to come that will describe the coming of the Antichrist. Yet no film will ever be as short and as powerful as Yeats' ""The Second Coming"". The film is a masterpiece in cinematographic form, though it is rather easy and uses some techniques (hiatus and ellipse) that are so common that they need some renewing to be as effective as they could be. That is to say that this film has aged because it uses techniques of cinematographic story telling that have been so much improved and multiplied over the last three decades that they seem slightly weak in this film. In a way that's a shame because it remains a matrix of that type of horror stories but it has lost a lot of its bleakness and terrifying effect. I even find it weak in some sections, like the killing of the devilish son. Weak and tamed and softened and many other things. Thirty years ago killing a child of five could seem horrible. Today, I just wonder if it is not something we are born with. After all the genocides of the last twenty years and all the suicide bombers, even at times women with child, we have the right to wonder if that insanity is not in-grown in our memory from beyond birth and death, like some genetic inheritance, some genetic re-incarnation. I was expecting something a lot more powerful because I will definitely consider that the religious gibberish in the film is just what it is ""gibberish"". John did a lot better in his days, even if he was not the only one to hold the pen that wrote the Book of Revelation.

The gated cemetary guarded by hounds from hell was fantastic, and as far as atmosphere and pure horror this scene was on a par with the old Universal movies.  The musical score was very effective at establishing the mood for the film.

What I don't understand was the absolute rave that came out of Hollywood for this film at the academy awards which had dozens of dancers on stage and vocalists chanting in Latin. This was entertaining but didn't really make any sense.  All of Hollywood turned out to say this film was the best thing for horror since Universal's Frankenstein. I thought it was good but not deserving of all that praise.

This was the first horror film I saw with my wife after we were married in 1976, and I really had to work to get her to see it. Actually, it worked out well for both of us as she appeared to like this film, minus the explicit gore. This was the first of the Omen films and set the series off to a good start for years to come.

This film received extensive advertising on posters, NYC subway stations, newspapers, radio and television and got many fans talking about it prior to release.

I give it 5 stars because it's one of the very few horror movies that actually scared me. Afterwards I couldn't stop thinking about it.

He then allows a sorceress nanny and her vicious Rotweiller to literally take over the house. He then refuses to believe a Catholic Priest, who has the audacity to suggest that Peck's real son was murdered at birth, and was quickly replaced by a son of Satan. When the priest is subsequently killed by a flying spike, Peck still does nothing that the priest had warned him to do. His maddening stubborness quickly leads to a household dive which nearly kills Remick, the diabolical beheading of a photographer friend,and yet another dive by Remick through the top of an ambulance from an upper storey hospital window.(Does this seem stranger than fiction)?

279157,5,6300247104,"Wes Craven says it best in his DVD Appreciation: By staying several notches below the vile and brutalizing excesses of ""THE EXORCIST,"" ""THE OMEN"" appealed to and frightened a much broader audience. Director Richard Donner crafted a far superior film than ""THE EXORCIST"" because you can be genuinely frightened by ""THE OMEN"" and not feel repulsed or feel like vomiting.  The horrors of ""THE OMEN"" are more psychological in nature. The casting of Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, Billie Whitelaw, and David Warner gives gravitas to a situation that might have been ridiculous if played by  less talented,  less subtle  actors. Because Gregory Peck eventually believes  his tot is the Devil, Jr.,  we the viewers believe it, too. Interestingly, his allegedly emotionally fragile wife Lee Remick is a lot smarter than he is; for she begins to believe it much sooner.
  Donner directs with the perfect balance of mounting tension and wise restraint.  Even Donner's handling of young Harvey Stevens as Damien is ideal. Stevens appears simultaneously demonic AND angelic. Donner uses Stevens very sparingly, but effectively, in scenes. When Damien has a major freak-out outside a church, Stevens' screams do, indeed, sound unearthly. ""THE OMEN"" was Stevens' only film. A quick Internet search revealed that the  missing in action  Stevens now lives a quiet life in England, where the film was shot.
  Athiest Donner was apparently not disturbed at all by the demonic/Biblical ramifications in the script. Funnily enough, he never seems to understand why anybody would be disturbed by this film. He pitched the project to Peck and everbody involved as a ""psychological thriller."" The basic idea  was, in fact, suggested by Born Again Christian Robert Munger, who served as the film's Religious Advisor and is heavily interviewed on the DVD documentaries. Donner's masterstroke, I think, was to have David Seltzer tone down the overtly demonic aspects of the script's initial draft titled THE ANTICHRIST and rework it so the bizarre occurances could also be interpreted as springing from coincidences in everyday life. At the same time, the bizarre occurances do neatly line up with the Biblical Book of Revelations. which Seltzer studied for three months prior to writing.  In the end, Seltzer delivered an extremely tight, concise, well-constructed screenplay that grabs you whether you're a Christian or an agnostic/atheist.
Of course, Jerry Goldsmith's score contributes greatly to the disturbing atmosphere  (especially the ""Black Mass: Ave Satani""  repeated chanted chorus) of the film. as Peck, particularly, moves from logical reason to the realization that his worse paranoid fears may, in fact, be true. Goldsmith discusses his Academy Award Winning Score at length on the DVD.
  Distraught when his son is still-born, ambassador Robert Thorne (Peck) rather quickly accepts another baby boy from a priest (Martin Benson). He does not tell his wife Kathy (Remick) about the baby's death or the baby switch, fearing it would shatter her. Robert is named Ambassador to Britian. All is peaceful and prosperous until Damien's nanny (Holly Palance) commits suicide during his fifth birthday party. Mrs. Baylock (Whitelaw) soon arrives as a replacement. Her initial demenor suggests Mary Poppins, but she's been sent straight from Satan's School for Nannies. Father Brennen (Patrick Troughton) appears to confront Robert and starts screaming that
he must accept Jesus Christ as his Savior-- and that both he and Kathy are in grave danger. Brennan is  memorably killed shortly afterwards.  After  incidents  at  Church and Zoo,  Kathy suffers a terrifying fall from a balcony (listen to the DVD commentary for Donner's tale on how this memorable scene was ingeniously filmed), Robert begins to take Brennen's warnings more seriously. Hospitalized, Kathy says to Robert, ""Don't let him kill me. Don't let him kill me,"" which is, to me, the scariest moment in the entire film.  Photographer Keith Jennings, (David Warner) who has been tracking Robert since Damien's birthday party, joins Robert on a quest to solve the puzzle of Damien's true parentage. The climaxtic final scenes still give me chills.  Donner received angry letters from viewers complaining that he ""Let Evil Win In The End."" That final twist, shot by Donner in an extra day and a half, was actually the idea of 20th Century Fox President Alan Ladd, Jr.
  The documentary ""THE OMEN LEGACY"" reveals just how superior Donner's Original film is when compared with the sequels and remake. All sequels and remakes can definitely go straight to Hell. The same documentary and DVD commentaries also humorously reveal that Donner can barely remember the names of anybody he worked with on this classic film, except for Peck, Remick, and Stevens.",1193529600,,4789,5.256241787122208
279158,4,6300247104,"HORROR HIGHLIGHTS:
The strongest highlight in this classic for me is the original score which is one of greatest unsettling scores from a horror film in my opinion.  Jerry Goldsmith won the Oscar in 1976 for his original musical score and deservedly so.  However the creepiest music is played only during the beginning credits and the end credits.  Although the words on the screen at the end albeit confusing I gather refer to man being the devil then followed by the most unsettling music of the film leaving you with an eerie feeling, very effective being it's the last thing you see.
The other notable highlight I'd like to remind viewers of is Damien's nanny cheerfully hanging herself at his birthday party as she tells him it's all for him.  This was also a chilling visual.
Other than the two above highlights The Omen is a good story and makes the son of the devil believable, the acting is solid, and it has some interesting ideas.  It is a very good film and story not just for the horror genre but for any genre.
The Omen at times did move slow, and that's fine, I like time to digest my films and experience them.  I also felt it choppy at times and didn't flow as well.  For example if you've seen it a couple of times it's like  here comes the part with the babysitter, now here comes the part at the zoo, now here comes the part the wife gets hurt.  Now a film like The Exorcist after multiple viewings I still get so wrapped up in the story I forget what scary part is going to come and then it hits me, oh no, here comes that part and with The Omen I don't get that, I know exactly what's coming next.  I believe The Omen deserves to be under the horror genre but for me besides the two parts I mention above it lacked any real scares and was more of a mystery and political drama to me then horror, however the ending as I said does leave the viewer with a sense of dread.

THE REMAKE:
It's been nominated for a Razzie (which is bad) and hated on by everyone from the anti remake crowd, to lovers of the classic (I love classic horror), to just about everyone.  Why?  Ready folks here comes all the unhelpful votes and hate comments, I actually liked the remake and thought it did justice to the film.  As pure entertainment purposes it was also a funner watch for me, but that isn't to say it's better and I enjoy films for all different types of reasons.
To the anti remake crowd who would complain remakes don't follow the original:
The Omen remake was almost the exact same film frame for frame and also had some pretty solid acting.  I realize Julia Stiles was in Save the Last Dance but put that aside she seemed more distraught then  Lee Remick.
For those that say it didn't have an original spin I also disagree:
The passage referred to from revelations ""When the Jews return to Zion / And a comet rips the sky / And the Holy Roman Empire rises, / Then You and I must die. / From the eternal sea he rises, / Creating armies on either shore, / Turning man against his brother / 'Til man exists no more"":
The examples they give in the 2006 version are a lot more frightening (9 11, Katrina) and similar and have the bonus of being recent, which should hit home more.
To paraphrase another line [ the son of the devil will rise through politics ] I can't see that line ever ringing more true than when this remake was released.  So the film keeps true to the original just relates it to our time and perhaps leads a younger generation to seek out the classic, a generation that might be anti older movie.
The freaky images that appear in the remake with a great Dolby Digital 5.1 track playing as when Stiles closes the bathroom mirror, they are cheap tricks to scare someone and make them jump, but with the volume jacked they will in fact make you jump, and the visuals are pretty creepy.
Specific example:  In the original in the cemetery they have dogs appear slowly and start growling then attack.  In the remake those dogs come out of no where and have you jumping out of your chair.

KEEPING IT ""REEL"":
To keep it real, if you want to see a film about the son of the devil that is filled with terror and dread I'd go with Polanski's Rosemary's Baby.  If you want to see the greatest good v. evil movie about the devil there is no greater film than The Exorcist.  The Omen does belong in every horror fan's movie collection without question and it has a great and original concept.  As I said it transcends beyond just the horror genre and goes into political, adventure, drama, and mystery themes as well.

279159,4,6300247104,"The Omen was the first horror film I ever saw at the cinema. At the time it made a huge impression on me. I've probably seen in on TV since then, but certainly it didn't have the same impact on me then. So when I came to watch the DVD I wasn't really expecting that much from the film.

Well I was wrong. On DVD in widescreen on a decent size widescreen TV this is still a terrific film. Some of the set pieces are brilliantly done and the cast are all good. Gregory Peck and David Warner steal the acting honours, although Patrick Troughton and Billie Whitelaw who both have small key roles are very good as well.

Of course this film probably wouldn't have happened if The Exorcist hadn't been made. It isn't as good a film as the The Exorcist, but in many ways its much more entertaining. Make sure you see the 1976 original version, before watching the remake from last year. I haven't seen the new version, but apparently its pretty much a shot for shot remake and as such is rather pointless, and therefore it will spoil the original for you if you see it first.",1192579200,,1068,4.282178217821782

279215,4,6300247104,"The Omen (Richard Donner, 1976)

Well, I girded my loins and got ready to watch the remake of The Omen. My library decided it didn't know one from the other, and sent me the original version instead. I hadn't seen it a few years, and I can't remember having ever reviewed it, so I popped it in and gave it another look. Not surprisingly, it hasn't changed much in thirty years. It's still as wonderful, and as creepy, as ever. The wonderful comes for the most part from Richard Donner. The creepy, all of it, comes from Harvey Stephens, the six-year-old kid who plays Damien. (Oddly, Stephens made one more movie and then disappeared, only to resurface again in a bit part in the remake of this very film.)

The plot is simple: the American Ambassador to Great Britain (Gregory Peck) finds out his son (Stephens) is the antichrist. He refuses to believe when a succession of priests try to warn him, but starts getting fidgety when approached by a photojournalist (the incomparable David Warner) whose pictures are showing very weird things surrounding some people who've recently got very dead. Ambassador and journalist go off to try and uncover the mystery of how to kill a god, while Damien and his infernal nanny (Billie Whitelaw, recently of Hot Fuzz) stick around the estate spooking the living daylights out of Damien's mum (Lee Remick).

The wealth of talent in this film is amazing, more so when you realize that while the principal actors (save Stephens, of course, who was nominated for a Golden Globe for standing around and looking creepy) were already well-known--Peck had won an Oscar, Remick had been nominated for one, and Warner was a BAFTA nominee, all in the sixties--Donner, now recognized as a top-notch American director for his work in the seventies and eighties, was a nobody in 1976. He'd made a few minor films in the sixties, but the vast majority of his directorial work was in television. Then came The Omen. Like so few directors, Donner made the jump from TV to the big screen, and he did it with style. ""Style,"" in this case, included persuading the studio to cough up $25,000 to hire Jerry Goldsmith to provide the music (he won his only Oscar from twenty-eight nominations for the sublimely eerie score) and talking cinematographer Gilbert Taylor (Repulsion) out of retirement to do the film. (Amusingly, Taylor then kept working until 1994, the year he turned eighty.) Surrounding yourself with the right people will do you right, but Donner himself well knew what he was doing behind a camera, and it shows.

So if you saw the remake and are wondering what all the fuss is about, check out the original, even if you've seen it before. This is good stuff. ****",1184025600,,2697,4.744136460554371

279219,5,6300247104,"The original 1976 Richard Donner film ""The Omen"" ranks high on my list of all-time favorite horror movies. You'll notice I wrote ""original"" in that sentence. That's because, I regret to inform you, Hollywood decided to lens a remake last year. Ugh. I haven't seen this ""reimagining"" yet, so maybe I shouldn't be too hard on it, but I can't picture anyone improving on the effectiveness of the original. Anyway, I would probably place ""The Omen"" in the top five of my abovementioned list. It's that good of a movie. I like Donner's film so much that I even went on to develop a fondness for the two inferior sequels that followed: ""Damien: Omen II"" and ""Omen III: The Final Conflict"". Both follow-ups possess their own little charms that make them worth viewing (love the guy wrapped in plastic swinging through the fire in the third entry), but neither exhibits the sheer power and originality of the first film. ""The Omen"" gives us everything a good horror movie should. We get scads of gothic atmosphere, satanic evil, original death sequences, amazing performances from a first rate cast, a memorable musical score, and scares aplenty. That's the best thing about ""The Omen"": it's deeply frightening on many levels.

As the film opens, we learn that powerful American businessman Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) has a serious problem. His wife Kathy (Lee Remick), finally in a position to give the couple their first child, loses the baby in a hospital in Rome. Since she doesn't yet know the child died during birth, Robert conspires with a priest named Spiletto (Martin Benson) to hide the fact from his wife. They substitute another baby born that day and no one seems any worse for the wear. The couple, with their new son Damien (Harvey Stephens) in tow, proceeds to live what promises to be an enormously privileged life. Their fortunes increase further when Robert receives an ambassadorship to England. But there are problems aplenty, disturbing problems that point to something seriously amiss. For example, Damien's nanny takes her life in a very public manner during the young child's birthday party. Her replacement, the sinister Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw), seems an odd choice as a nanny. That she's so overprotective of little Damien also seems weird. Another problem emerges when Kathy starts expressing doubts about Damien's lineage. She thinks he's not her real child.

She's right, of course, but that knowledge won't save anyone. You see, Damien Thorn is the anti-Christ, the son of Satan come to fulfill biblical prophecies concerning the end of time. No one knows this little factoid at this point, but Robert Thorn soon begins hearing about it from Father Brennan (Patrick Troughton), a crazed priest who starts stalking Thorn and raving about his evil child. After Brennan perishes in a bizarre accident, an investigative journalist by the name of Keith Jennings (David Warner) uncovers a few horrific pieces of evidence that tend to confirm that Damien Thorn is, indeed, the son of Satan. With proof in hand, Jennings eventually makes a believer out of Robert Thorn. The two then begin a secretive quest to unearth Damien's true origins, but they'll have to hurry. Folks poking into the child's history, or even people who present some sort of obstacle to the boy's development, seem to die in excruciatingly painful ways. As the story unfolds, we learn that even Robert and Kathy Thorn aren't safe from the pint-sized prince of darkness. The only solution to the problem comes in the form of an old archeologist named Bugenhagen (Leo McKern) and a bag of ancient daggers...

Rewatching ""The Omen"" for the umpteenth time, on DVD no less, confirms for me once again that this movie achieves a greatness rarely seen in the annals of horror. Just look at the movie. Where else are you going to see a nanny hanging herself in public, a priest impaled with a steel rod, a beheading by shattered glass, and biblical mumbo jumbo all in a film starring Gregory Peck? Nowhere, my friends, nowhere. It's all here in glorious color. I love everything about the film. I love the cemetery scene with the wild dogs. I love the ""666"" birthmark on the kid's head, revealed in a truly terrifying scene. I love the weird images in Keith Jennings's photos. I love the showdown between Mrs. Baylock and Robert Thorn. I love the screaming fit outside the church as well as the zoo attack. I even love the ""No, Daddy, NO!"" line at the end of the film. The movie simply overflows with all sorts of clever ideas and bloody mayhem wrapped up in excellent acting and dialogue. In the hands of lesser mortals, ""The Omen"" would come off as a schlocky piece of cheese. With Donner at the helm, Jerry Goldsmith composing the score of his life, and Peck and Remick carrying the acting duties, the movie fires on all cylinders.

I rented the DVD not because I needed to see the film again, but because I wanted to listen to Donner's commentary track. It's good. He recounts all sorts of interesting tidbits about the movie, such as the curse that seemed to plague the production. The director also talks about the problems he had with the young Harvey Stephens, who apparently was a little devil in real life, and talks about the marketing of the picture. Other extras include an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith, a trailer for the film, and a couple of lengthy featurettes that go into more depth about the film and the supposed curse. As for audio and picture quality, I've seen some people griping about them. I don't have a problem here. I thought the movie sounded and looked great. So there you go. If you haven't seen the original Omen flick, you simply must run out and find a copy right now. You'll have a great time watching this creative, scary horror flick!",1178582400,,5771,4.814516129032258

A horror film that's actually SCARY, and not simply gross or disgusting.  Great acting by both Peck and Remmick, great pacing by Donner and Baird (the film editor) and FANTASTIC SCORE!!  Creeping suspense, mixed with satanic sons, demonic dogs and nannies with knives, cultimating in some totally wicked good vs. evil, all against a totally belivable contemporary (for the time) atmosphere.  In my opinion, this film has aged very little, apart from clothes and hairstyles.  What's nice is that the violence is used with such sparing effect, it really hits you when you're shocked.  And if anybody else noticed, there's no profanity at all in this movie, which keeps you from being distracted from the story (my favorite words have only four letters, but sometimes it's nice not to get an earful just so a film can prove itself as 'adult').

Highly recommended!!  Especially for those who generally wouldn't consider themselves 'horror' fans.  For those who like a great story, good suspense, and great acting, this is definitely a classic!!  But don't touch the sequals!!",1170720000,2,1209,4.935643564356436

279222,5,6300247104,"The Omen (the original) is the one that started it all. For its time, it was an intellegently written and well told story that was utterly terryfying in how realistic it seemed. The basic story is about the birth of the anti-christ and the beginning of the end of man's existence on earth.

A diplomat named Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) has agreed to secretly exchange his wife Kathrine's (Lee Remick) dead infant with another newborn whose mother just died. The child is apparently a normal and healthy kid until his fifth birthday when his nanny decides to hang herself in front of everyone saying ""It's all for you Damien."" Soon some other bizzare deaths happen including a priest who warns Robert Thorn of Damien's heritage.

The film has many memorable scenes and was just very creepy. The mood and atmosphere was also enhanced by a musical score that will send shivers down your spine. There is of course a birthmark on Damien which is the number 666 the sign of the devil which proves that he is the son of Satan.

The gore and violence was kept to a minimum except for the decapitation scene but the film was scary enough without having a lot of gore. It was the suspense that carried the film and the good script. If you haven't seenn it yet, you should.",1166313600,,1262,4.5506607929515415

For there is a hidden secret behind what the child could be that is beyond shocking! he is the antichrist and will soon set up armageddon.

A startling, dark and gothic horror thriller shocker that has became one of the most popular horror movies of the 70's spawning three sequels, imitators and one recent remake. Damien has became one of the most recongized horror icons ever just like Michael, Freddy or Jason! it's a biblical horror epic that has frightened audiences since then, the acting is very good and so is the classic Jerry Goldsmith score. The kills are very creative like the unforgettable death of a priest which makes today's CGI effects look like a walk in the park as this is a true classic of the time yet still is an effective movie today.

It definitely wipes the floor with recent pretenders like 'Lost Souls' and 'End Of Days'.

The movie carefully moves along, with a controlled performance by the always dignified Peck. It features some memorable murder set-pieces (not showing more blood than is necessary, however), particularly the decapitation, which you have to see to believe. Sometimes fairly creepy - the best sequence is the night-time one set in the old graveyard with the devil dogs milling about.  The deaths most of the cast meet are inventive and in some cases, memorable for many years after viewing the film - giving the opportunity for some unusual and striking visuals, while the whole film is soaked in that loud Goldsmith score to great effect.

""When the Jews return to Zion, and a comet rips the sky, and the Holy Roman Empire rises, Then You and I must die. From the eternal sea he rises, creating armies on either shore, turning man against his brother 'Til man exists no more.""

To me, this movie always gave me the same feeling as The Godfather: that it was a complete bore. I thought everything about it was boring. I remember one time it was on TV and I flipped to it and I was bored immediately and I proceeded to change the channel. That was not all that long ago so why do I love this film now?

Robert Thorne (Gregory Peck) arrives at a Roman hospital on June 6th where his wife is having a child. The child is stillborn and is dead. Thorne is devastated because they wanted more than anything to have a child. A priest suggests something to Thorne; adopt a child whose mother died during labor at the same moment his child was born. Thorne is reluctant but eventually decides to do just that. He never tells his wife, Kathy (Lee Remick), about the switch so she is left to assume everything went well. Five years pass and at Damien's birthday party something terrible happens. This sets off a whole series of grisly and terrible events. A lone photographer, Jennings (David Warner) who seems an omen in his pictures sets off on a journey with Thorne to figure out exactly what is going on. Could Damien be the Anti-Christ?

There is so much more to the plot than what I have said. The story is so engrossing and takes many twists and turns by the end of the movie. The actors all help this movie stay so interesting because the cast is al superb here. Gregory Peck has always been a favorite of mine (although I've only seen him in To Kill a Mockingbird and he is wonderful here. Normally the first role you see an actor in you associate them with that role and they become typecast to the viewer. Truly great actors can break the mold with every performance they give so that the viewer does not see them as a previous character. Peck does just that. Not once during the movie did I think ""Hey, that's Atticus"" or ever think that it was out of place for Atticus to be doing that. Peck plays the character so well and makes everything believable even if the situation at hand is impossible in our world. Lee Remick is strong as Thorne's wife, even if she doesn't have all that much screen time. David Warner (ok, I did see him as the professor from TMNT II here, but only because I wanted to see him as that) is great here as Jennings the photographer. He pulls of a great performance later in the movie where his character is more prominent. Billie Whitelaw plays a very sinister Mrs. Baylock. She seems normal at the beginning but at the end she is one evil bitch. I was waiting for ELO's ""Evil Woman"" to play at some point. She speaks with such a clam voice but her face, especially those eyes, are so twisted looking that she really steals every scene she is in (except the end of the movie, Peck knocks that one out of the park). Harvey Stephens is great as Damien. He's the original creepy kid and he plays it so naturally and does not overdo it nor does he try to be evil, which is a problem with the creepy kids of today. You can tell they are trying to be evil and it hinders the film.

Contrary to popular belief, Damien is not really the main focus of the story. Sure the story is built around him but this is more Thorne's story and him dealing with the lie he made five years ago. You wonder at times whether or not he is going insane because it all comes down to the fact that he wants to kill a five year old boy; a five year old boy who he has called his son and who has been called daddy. You can see that earlier in the movie Kathy is starting to lose her sanity and that leads you to ask yourself if the events are truly happening or if Thorne is losing his sense of what is or is not real.

The score is absolutely wonderful here. The choir was a great addition to the music and Jerry Goldsmith's decision to make it more gothic really helps. The use of the choir is really superb, Latin words are used and they really enhance every scene they're used in. Goldsmith truly deserved his Oscar for his work here, it is outstanding

I do wish however that we got to see more omens. The ones we did see were great though. The pictures were a great touch and the way they were used was very well done. I love things like that and this effect was used perfectly in this movie though. I just wish that there were more than three photograph omens used. The deaths, the few there were, were great though; very inventive (you have got to love the sheet of glass. Classic scene right there).

There are really very few faults with this movie, if any. I truly love this movie. Everything about is was just superb. The acting, the story, the score, everything. This is a true classic and I don't know why it has taken me this long to actually see this movie, I wish I would have seen it a long time ago.

1. Where Damien's babysitter hangs herself at his birthday party where everyone can see.
2. Where 5-year-old Damien screams and tears away at the statue of Mary at the church.
3. Where Damien's father sees the 666 sign on Damien's head.

279269,5,6300247104,"The Omen was one of the first true horror movies I was allowed to see as a kid. I think that was based on the fact that it was not excessively gory. In retrospect, it was probably one of the most frightening films I can remember.

However, I wasn't alone and other kids at school also saw it, meaning that any kid called Damien was regularly checked for ""666"" birthmarks...but I digress.

Hearing there was a remake, I revisited the original to see if it was still the scary and intriguing film I remember. And it is, but perhaps now I also recognise it as being one that is effective through good film making and quality acting.

Storywise, this is a cleverly told interpretation of the anti-christ's appearance on earth, as foretold in the New Testament's Book of Revelation.

Gregory Peck is Robert Thorn, the US ambassador in Britain, rearing a son who was swapped with his own stillborn (or so he was told) child at birth.

Damien is the name of the impish infant who is lovingly tended by Lee Remick, playing Thorn's wife.

Well, strange things start to happen, of course, and it seems that Damien not only has some behavioural issues (attacking his mother when taken to church) but also has a strange effect on animals (baboons at the zoo go ape, literally) and people - his first nanny commits suicide at his birthday party.

Like most well-meaning parents, the Thorns try to carry on as normal, but then the signs that all is not quite normal with young Damien become quite hard to ignore.

Soon a few people in the know start interpreting the Book of Revelation as indicating that Damien is infact the anti-christ.

This is the cue for Gregory Peck, along with an intrepid photographer played by David Warner, to go on an international journey in search of the truth and how to deal with the young anti-christ.

A very large measure of this film's success in chilling the audience is Jerry Goldsmith's score, which is unforgettable.

The way in which the biblical prophecies are interpreted is also cleverly done, and by the end of the film you can see that young Damien is positioning himself for ultimate power.

Damien also has something of a following of ""familiars"", such as sinister nanny Mrs Baylock, played by Billie Whitelaw, who is everything a nightmare nanny should be.

Interviews with the film-makers are full of insight and interest, with a touch of nostalgia.

Quite genuinely disturbing is the number of accidents and incidents that befell cast and crew in making this film, enough for more than a few publicity myths to be born.

All in all, a horror classic in the truest sense, as it remains chilling and despite it's age is less dated than many made after it.

This special edition includes everything from the first release: Richard Donner's commentary, a deleted scene, the featurette on all the weird coincidences & tragedies that happened around the filming, and the just over 40 minute documentary on the making of the film.

The new features added- not including the spiffy new slip case cover and spooky white cover- are as follows. We get a short introduction from director Donner, a 20 minute featurette that is basically Wes Craven talking about why he likes the film so much. Kind of random stuff, but the thing that made me upgrade is the new, just under 2 hour documentary. It's narrated by Jack Palance- that's worth the money right there- and goes into detail of how it started as an idea as ""The Anti-Christ"", then ""The Birthmark"" and finally the completed ""The Omen.""

This re-release was obviously done to promote the new remake, but they actually make it worth your while. The packaging really is nice, and for fans of the Omen or those interested in the odd happenings that surround it- this is a worthy addition to your collection.

The woman's husband, Robert Thorn, doesn't want his beloved wife to know what had happened, so he agrees to switch the two babies, because the other mother had apparently died giving birth. Little do the parents know but their son is actually the devil's spawn.

This movie plays with the viewers mind. Along with the creepy music and twisted plot, it keeps the viewer intrigued with the film. The reason why this movie has made its mark in history is because of the simplicity it possesses, which is what makes it so frightening. The Omen works with everybody's most known fear, the devil, and the birth of the anti-Christ, the end of the world. It's the classic battle of good and evil. Except in this movie, evil is in the form of a child. It's the simple notion of the devil taking over our world, and everybody who will get in the way will die of mysterious deaths. The fashion in which the deaths occur can leave some people quite shocked, it is something that you often times wouldn't expect from a film this old.

With the recent release of the Omen this year, which coincidently came out on June 6th of this year, 666, just goes to show how much this movie has impacted us throughout the years.

The release of the 2-disc C.E. which is to celebrate its 30th anniversary includes a bulk of special features on the second disc.

Aside from David Seltzer's interesting script and Richard Donner's masterful direction,what distinctly differentiates this  movie from other horror movies is Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning original score (Best Music 1976),which gives it a disturbingly eerie atmosphere of horror.

Even when nothing scary is happening, once the plot gets going, the story and the great music score give you this horrible sense of forboding that at any minute the absolute worst is about to happen.  I feel my blood pressure going up just thinking about it.

This movie is infinitely better than our modern slice and dice slasher movies because it was about something more than an excuse to exhibit carnage.

I do have one question though -- how in heaven's name (this pun IS intended) did the distributor miss the obvious?  This should have been released on June 6, 2006.  What were they thinking?",1150329600,3,881,4.4625
279314,5,6300247104,"this is one of the best horror movies ever made! the air of creepy doom that hangs over this tale of evil reaches into your soul and with a cold hand grabs your nerves and doesn't let go till the bitter end.

  gregory peck and lee remick are robert and kathy thorn,a rich and powerful politician and his wife and as the film open they are looking foward to the birth of their first child(they have lost at least one to a miscarrage)! when thorn gets to the hospital he finds his son died just after birth and he fears it will send his wife over the edge,when the most sinster priest in history who tells him a mother has had her baby and died at almost the same time so why not raise the boy she had as his own.

  flash forward four years,thorn is now the ambassador to england and his boy is just the sweetest thing you can believe. at his fourth birthday party his nanny,in front of all the guest and children,calls the boys name ""damien it's all for you"" as they all turn she jumps from the roof of the house and hangs herself and this thriller is off and running. more deaths(always done so as to be ""accidents"" and that way you never are really sure if it's evil or just bad luck)follow and we watch the mind of mr.thorn slip into the horror of what he has brought into his family and the world! like i said, this is one of the scariest movies made! the sence of doom and the feeling that all involved with damien(the boys name)are really not able to understand or really fight this unearthly evil.

  the print is very crisp and the extras are great,so if you love horror movies that offer a little brains with there fright,this is the one you want. and a word about the final 20 mins.,don't close your eyes and have the lights on because it is the most frighting and creepy endings of all time(love the final shot!!!!!!) one of the best!!!!",1150243200,2,1849,4.26

Considering this release does NOT appear to be remastered I don't see the point of releasing this movie again over the previous incarnation.  Nearly all the bonuses are already included in the previous release.  All they seem to have done is split it on two discs which is supposed to make it ""special"".  Granted there appears to be another commentary track, some still photos and a minor deleted scene ( by Mrs. Baylock attack) -- but that is not enough for those of us who already own it on the previous DVD release.

This is the most Satanic movie I have ever seen and it just sends chills up your spine! That Damien kid is so creepy and he's the Antichrist to make matters worse. It was hilarious to see Damien cause the babysitter to commit suicide! The original Omen is the way to go. The sequels sucked and the recent re-make was dreadful! Watch the original Omen and prepare for the most Satanic horror flick ever!!!!!!!!!,1149984000,4,546,4.525252525252525
279317,5,6300247104,"The Omen is a chilling tale about the birth of the Antichrist.  The story begins with the stillbirth of the child of Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck), the future U.S. ambassador to Great Britain.  Robert Thorn is heartbroken about his son's death and does not wish for his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) to share in his misery.  He wishes to conceal the fate of his son from his wife but is at a loss of what do. It is then at the suggestion of a priest Fr. Spilleto, that Robert decides to adopt a child whose ""mother died at birth"".  The child is named Damien and his adoption is kept a secret from Katherine in order to hide the truth of her real son's death.  Unbeknownst to the Thorns, Damien is in actuality the Antichrist who was born of a jackal. The truth of the adoption will slowly unravel throughout the story with dire consequences.

The appealing screenplay of the Omen can be attributed to two factors. The first factor is based on the screenplay's loose reliance of biblical scripture. The sign or the omen of the Antichrist is after all, a birthmark that comes in the form of three sixes.  The three sixes are of course derived from the Book of the Apocalypse which states that the mark of the Beast will be six hundred and sixty-six.  The screenplay's second important factor is its incorporation of three catalysts, a priest, a photographer, and an exorcist.  The priest Fr. Brennan (Patrick Troughton) is the one who shoulders the burden of knowing Damien's true identity. He feels he has an obligation to reveal to Richard Thorn the true nature of his adopted son in order to redeem himself before God.  Fr. Brennan was after all, part of a bad flock of priests (which include Fr. Spilleto) who helped secure Damien's birth.  It is the priest therefore who first introduces to the viewer the true nature of Damien.  The photographer Keith Jennings (David Warner) on the other hand, is an outsider who has noticed some bizarre phenomenon occur in his photo developing. It is through his curiosity that he is led to investigate and piece together the cause of all the bizarre unfolding events.  The photographer thus serves to develop the movie just as if he were developing his own photos!  Finally the exorcist, Carl Bugenhagen (Leo McKern) is the closer (unlike the character McKern played in A Man For All Seasons). He is the one who has the knowledge and the means to putting an end to the threat of the Antichrist, provided of course all of his instructions are carefully heeded.  The character however not to be overlooked although not a catalyst, is the evil nanny Mrs. Baylock (Billie Whitelaw).  Indeed Mrs. Baylock immediately establishes her satanic presence when she eerily says, ""Fear not little one. I am here to protect thee"".  Mrs. Baylock is after all a Lady Macbeth type whose creepy personality is enough to send chills up anyone's spine.

It is no surprise that the Omen won the Academy Award for best soundtrack. Indeed Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score is in a class of its own.  The sheer power of the liturgical opening ""Ave Satani"" is memorable and can almost single-handedly take credit for the fright and appeal of the film.  The music is synchronized to the most visual parts of the movie.  The accompanying music to the Rottweiler scenes has echoes of the Planet of the Apes soundtrack (another Jerry Goldsmith score).  Even so the music is perfectly synchronized to the panting and movements of the Rottweilers. On a final note regarding the music, the deluxe edition remastered soundtrack is itself worth buying as there are several tracks worth listening to in addition to the ones already described.  The tracks ""Killer Storm"" and ""Altar"" are very engaging even if one has never even seen the movie.  The track ""Day he died"" however is best appreciated with its intended visual scene. The track itself occurs during the scene when Robert Thorn and the photographer Keith Jennings rummage through Fr. Brennan's apartment.  At one point in the scene Keith shows Robert the photo in which he accidentally took of himself through a reflection and says, ""It's my problem too"".  At this point the soundtrack percussion takes over as it accompanies the scene with the bizarre photo. The resulting effect is quite terrifying to say the least.  Years later the Japanese horror film ""Ringu"" would utilize the same audiovisual technique but with less effectiveness.

The DVD special edition comes with an audio commentary given by the director Richard Donner.  There are several documentaries as well, the most notable being the Curse or Coincidence documentary that covers the mishaps, which occurred during filming. The DVD also boasts a newly remixed stereo English language soundtrack in addition the original mono English and French language tracks. The picture quality of the DVD is quite good, since the widescreen picture has been remastered as well. On a final note of the interactive menus of the DVD, there is a flashing of various scenes from the movie. The most curious flashing scene is the clown's reaction to the suicide of the first nanny.  Looking back, the benevolent clown actually appears to be sinister and bears a striking resemblence to John Wayne Gacy. It is a scene which the DVD makers made sure to capitalize on.

Thirty years after its release, the Omen's appeal has not dwindled as it has passed the test of time. It now faces the test of being compared to a remake, which not coincidentally opens up on 06/06/06.",1149552000,4,5479,4.821581196581197
279318,3,6300247104,"With the impending arrival of the remake, some people out there are engaging in vivid, inexplicable fantasies about how this movie is some sort of classic.  Tisn't the case.  'The Omen' is a a fairly decent horror movie, but it's  needlessly slow and hasn't aged well.  Now, I wasn't around at the time, but ample evidence suggests that the key to 'The Omen's popularity is rooted in the famed decapitation scene and the general creativity and outlandishness of the other death scenes.  In short, it relied on shock value, and it's no longer shocking, so you haven't got too much left to work with.  It isn't a bad movie, just a very average one, and certainly not one that should be mentioned alongside 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'The Exorcist', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' and so on.

As if you didn't know, the plot's like this:  There's this kid who is the Anti-Christ, and he starts killin' those who find out his true nature, as they generally tend not to be to pleased with this intel.  That is, in all seriousness, the short and long of it.  Now a lack of plot is fine in horror movies, often a good thing, but 'The Omen' drags us through what little plot there is very, very gradually.  We basically just watch the characters figure all this out, which takes them a helluva long time as Thorn wanders from place to place, and are treated to the occasional death scene, which are, again, no longer truly remarkable and which are few and far between.  The problem with this film, more than the general slowness and unimpressive plot, is that it can't really generate much atmosphere.  I suppose it's impossible to say why a film *failed* to create an oppressive atmospher, beyond that most of the individual occurrences and elements, like the nasty dog and evil nanny, just aren't particularly interesting or unnerving.  Contributing to this problem, Goldsmith's much lauded pseudo-gothic score is cheesy and overwrought rather than ominous.  Furthermore, Gregory Peck is dull and unsympathetic as the evil Damien's 'father'.  He's mostly just miscast.  This is Atticus Finch we're talking about here.  He doesn't belong in a horror movie.  None of the other performances are of any note at all.

Now, I've done nothing but complain, so I must again reiterate that this isn't a bad movie.  None of the flaws I've mentioned are fatally bad, but they're notable and, again, it doesn't have anything truly great about it to offset these concerns.  Still, the death scenes, the heart of the movie,, are still sufficiently amusing.  Again, nothing shocking or especially elaborate by modern day standards, but they're still fairly cool.  Nothing you won't have seen before, but most of it is worth a second look.

Though I can't know for sure yet, obviously, I can't help but suspect that for once a re-make will actually make the original obsolete this time.  I see no evidence that the execution in the remake is anything more than average, but it was no more than average the first time around, and it has got 30 years worth of special effects development on its side as well as tens of millions of dollars.  Still, it seems like a waste, since it looks like they've taken an average film, and then made another average, but more slick and expensive, film out of it.  Whatever the case, `The Omen' is now probably only of interest to horror buffs, and they'll almost certainly already have seen it.  It's merely passable, but that, of course, means that it is still good enough, if just barely.

Edit: I've since seen the remake, and it is indeed superior, though not a great film by any stretch of the imagination.  Very much the same thing, but the vastly improved production values and generally livelier performances elevate it quite a bit.  The remake is arguably more flatly silly at times, but that just ups the entertainment value.

Grade: C

Edit:  After receiving a huge pile of unhelpful votes, I've seen the LIGHT!!!!!!!!  The pointless slowness? FANTASTIC!!! The cheesy, lame music? BRILLIANT!!!!!! The mediocre plot? AMAZING!!!! The mixture of overacting and non-acting? ASTOUDING!!!! 666 STARS!!!!!!!!!",1149379200,12,4145,4.838068181818182
279319,5,6300247104,"This is a first class, gothic chiller with an outstanding cast, a riveting story line, and a musical score that will make the viewer want to sleep with the lights on! A first rate film, it had audiences riveted to the screen when it was first released in the mid nineteen seventies. I know. I was one of that audience. This film has withstood the test of time, as it is as gripping today, as when it was first released.

Katherine (Lee Remick) and Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) are a wealthy, older American couple. Katherine is pregnant and, while in Italy, gives birth to an ostensibly stillborn boy, a fact that is kept from her. Knowing how much his wife wanted the baby and the difficulty that she had in conceiving, Robert agrees to have the dead baby supplanted by a living newborn whose mother died in child birth, keeping this information from Katherine. They name this baby Damien.

All goes well for the prosperous Thorn family, until Damien turns five. A series of dramatic, unusual events begin to occur around the Thorns, all seemingly stemming from Damien. Well guarded by a self sufficient, somewhat creepy nanny (Billie Whitelaw), there are those who would believe him to be the Antichrist. By the time that Katherine and Robert begin to realize who Damien may truly be, their lives are out of control. With the aid of an inquisitive photographer, a repentant priest, and an archaeologist who holds the key to the destruction of the Antichrist, Robert Stone becomes a man with a mission. Will Damien let him complete that mission? Watch this movie and find out. You will not be disappointed. I guarantee that you will be sleeping with the lights on and the covers over your head.

David Seltzer wrote a terrific screenplay. This first class production, which is deftly directed by Richard Donner, is played with straightforward sincerity by its outstanding cast. The casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick was pure genius, as their distinguished reputations infused the movie with a believability not thought possible, given the theme of the script. Playing it straight, as a couple caught in a vortex of events over which they have little control, they sweep the viewer along with them. Supported by a fine cast, there are notable performances given by Billie Whitelaw, as the nanny with a mission, David Warner, as the photographer who begins to notice that something odd seems to be going on, and Harvey Stephens, as Damien, whose angelic countenance belies his satanic nature.

This is a riveting, subtle film that, with a few well planned, shocking moments, and an effectively creepy musical score that builds suspense to a crescendo, manages to thoroughly engage the viewer. If one is looking for a blood and gore fest, there is really none of that here. Instead, look to be scared out of the seat of your pants by a superb script, wonderful acting, deft direction, and a musical score that will long linger in one's memory. It is little wonder that Jerry Goldsmith, the composer of the original score for The Omen, won an Academy Award for his efforts. This first rate film is well worth having in one's collection. Bravo!",1148169600,4,3144,4.805914972273568
279380,5,6300247104,"THE OMEN has one of the best concepts I've ever heard for a film: the Book of Revelations talks about a powerful and completely evil man who will take over the world in the last days and represent Satan on earth.

What if that man was alive right now as a child?

That was how THE OMEN began when a Christian asked that question of a movie producer.  The producer hired a writer and they came up with a script (originally calling it ""The Birthmark"").  Richard Donner was brought onboard to direct and decided to tone down the supernatural elements to bring out a more-human story (is the child the spawn of Satan or could everything be just a horrible coincidence?), which was a brilliant angle.

THE OMEN has always been one of my all-time favorite films.  Even as the release of the 2006 remake approaches, I think they should actually release the original in theatres to introduce it to a new generation.  The direction, the writing, the Oscar-winning score by Jerry Goldsmith--it's just a great movie.  I remember hearing that this was the biggest money-making film of Gregory Peck's career (William Holden had turned it down...but then ended up in the sequel after the first film went through the roof).

In his commentary, Director Richard Donner said that the success of THE OMEN helped finance the studio's next blockbuster, STAR WARS.

I don't know what they've done with the remake (although I think casting Mia Farrow of ROSEMARY'S BABY as Mrs. Blaylock sounds great) but, if you've never seen the 1976 version, definitely check it out.",1147737600,2,1547,4.760299625468165

279382,5,6300247104,"I was a young boy when I first saw ""The Omen,"" and the first thing I did afterwards was to check my scalp in a bathroom mirror. I wanted to make damn sure I didn't have three sixes scratched into my skin, and the moments searching for it were moments of sheer unease.

I escaped that particular alarm, but I never escaped the lingering horror of this movie. Like ""The Exorcist"" before it, ""The Omen"" plays on the most ancient fear to befall man once he developed an imagination. Nothing will evoke primal terrors like depictions of the devil, because nothing less than the very soul is on the line.

I love everything about this movie. I love the pace and the climbing apprehension as events spin out of control. I love the nasty, little-boy smirk on that horrible child's face, and the insane devotion of those who protect him. ""The Omen"" is sly about it's delivery of fright. It creeps in, makes you extremely uncomfortable, and then slips out, leaving you to wonder what part of your psyche it will prey on next.

Unfailingly posted at the top of the all-time horror list, ""The Omen"" is one of those films that clings to your nerves and won't go away any time soon. Decades after my first viewing, I'm still thankful I never found numerals scrawled on my scalp. But for the grace of God...",1145664000,2,1292,4.48936170212766
279383,4,6300247104,"Certain films aren't really that scary, despite their fact they're called such. Rather, it's that the film contains subject matter which can be upsetting. I had the same reaction to Exorcism of Emily Rose which didn't really scare me but the idea of demonic possession kind of gets you unnerved. The Omen is similar where it didn't scare me but it'll probably make you a bit more sober the rest of the day.

After his baby doesn't survive childbirth, Robert, a prominent politician, ends up secretly inheriting another child in a ""what they don't know what harm them"" kind of way. Small things start to happen: a nanny hangs herself, a Rottweiler keeps showing up and a bit too aggressive nanny replacement gets really odd. Slowly the idea presents itself: the child might be the Anti-Christ himself and a photographer helps Robert figure things out.

One thing that is a slight hiccup is its pace: granted this isn't a fast paced gorefest like recent films but I was watching the film and literally only half an hour went by and the film felt longer. While the supernatural things happen, it's not kind of every 10 minutes thing and after awhile you kind of think the film's pace is a bit too leisurely. Certain scenes could've been trimmed but that's alright, Shining and Exorcist weren't exactly fast paced either but here it's kind of a blemish.

Despite it's obvious 70's looking makeup job, the film does have a classic decapitation that's probably not as brutal as other ones but it still does its job well, and it should considering the multiple camera angles on it. There's probably 5 or 6 cameras on it. The rest of the film isn't too gory but it's better that way: makes that one beheading stand out since nothing came before it in the movie(or since actually).

Is it a classic horror movie? Well for me it's debatable as it's certainly a well-known one but it probably doesn't have that much staying power.",1145664000,2,1919,4.685459940652819
279384,3,6300247104,"Interesting seeing this again after the passing of a good few years. Apparently there was a low budget for this film, but realising the importance of music to a film, the director did manage to get an extra shipment of money to be able to afford Jerry Goldsmith. What a stunning little opening ditty is 'Ave Satani.'

This is a film of 'moments' that everybody can remember, and this is wisely where Richard Donner seems to have concentrated the budget - the tragic incident at the children's' birthday party, the sudden violent squall hastening Father Brennan's demise. But does anybody remember the boring, drawn out, final 'climactic' sequence?

What stand out to me now are three excellent performances from familiar British faces. Billie Whitelaw looks like a real demon in human form somehow, Patrick Troughton certainly convinced me as a priest living in mortal fear for his eternal soul, and David Warner provides just the right amount of lightness of touch and serious emphasis when necessary as the cynical photographer who gets shaken out of his detached complacency and ends up a morally serious character.

There was one drop-off-the-seat moment for me, which I just cannot remember from the first time around - it's the photographer's explication of the relevant verse in Revelations. I really haven't the faintest idea if there is anything in biblical prophecy, but what he says in the film certainly applies a good deal more now then it did then. The scriptwriter suggested his main motivation for writing the script was the money, so maybe it's just one of those things.",1142812800,,1587,4.981132075471698

  ROBERT THORN (played by Gregory Peck) and his wife, KATHY (played by LEE REMICK) have given birth to a son. But their son was born a stillborn. Without Kathy's knowledge, Robert adopts an orphaned infant boy, who was born the same exact date and time as his own son was. Robert brings in the adopted child, where he Kathy name their son, DAMIEN.

  Five years later, after Robert is elected U.S. Ambassador to England, DAMIEN (played by Harvey Stephens), is celebrating his fifth birthday. All goes well, until Damien's nanny kills herself in front of Damien's whole party. The next morning, a new nanny named only MRS. BAYLOCK (played by Billie Whitelaw) enters and steps in as Damien's new nanny.

  Over the course of the next few days, strange things begin happening. A priest is suddenly killed in a freak accident, after he only warned Robert of Damien being the Antichrist. A mysterious photography named KEITH JENNINGS (played by David Warner) shows Robert pictures of Damien's old Nanny, the priest, and of himself. Each photo shows some sort of sign that indicated each of their deaths. Well, the nanny and priest have already met theirs and it looks like Keith is next.

  Robert and Keith wonder around, looking for proof on Damien being the son of Satan. They reach a graveyard in Rome, where the find the dead body of Robert's actual son. His real son was not a stillborn, for the hospital intentionally murdered him. They made the switch for a reason. They knew Damien was born the son of Satan; they knew Robert was going to be elected Ambassador. Therefore, Damien would be in protected hands. Mrs. Baylock has taken the job, for she is keeping a close eye on Damien.

  Robert finds out that Kathy is pregnant again, but Damien pushes Kathy over the stairwell banister, causing her to break her arm and miscarry. Robert phones Kathy at the hospital and tells her to leave and come to Rome, but Mrs. Baylock appears and pushes Kathy out the window, killing her.

  Robert has a meeting with a man anmed BUGENHAGEN, where informs Robert on how to kill Damien. He takes the seven daggers needed to do the deed. It has to be done in a church, will Damien's blood will spill on the church floors. For proof of Damien is the Antichrist, Robert should find a birthmark in the form of 666 on his head, under the hair. 666 stands for 6am on the sixth day of the sixth month. He finds the mark, as Mrs. Baylock attacks Robert, but Robert kills the demonical b*tch and takes Damien off to the church, with the police behind him. As Robert tries to kill Damien, the police enter and stop Robert by...killing him.

  This film was just outstanding. Words cannot describe this film. The acting was great. The settings were great. The suspense and horror was just perfectly scary. This is a film for everybody...but don't let your kids watch this until they are at least 13 or 14.",1135728000,,3053,4.6270871985157696
279389,5,6300247104,"I had not seen this movie in about 15 years, when I decided to take a look.  It was an old favorite of mine from my teen years...always loved the soundtrack.  I expected that it would have aged pretty horribly...but BOY was I pleasantly surprised.  It's a pretty darn terrific film.

The plot outline is hardly terribly original anymore.  It would appear that the child raised by Diplomat Gregory Peck and his wife Lee Remick was ""switched at birth"" for the devil's child.  This child is going to be protected by a number of evil forces, and eventually his position within a powerful family will lead him to power himself.  Devil-spawn has been featured many times in films.  But seldom with such a straight face.  And it's that straight face that makes this movie work so well.

It's a mystery story, as Peck slowly begins to suspect something might actually be wrong.  I suppose it helps the film to have an actor of Peck's stature take on such a role.  One might think it would be belittling to such a towering figure...but Peck doesn't play it like he's embarrassed to be in the film, and thus the darn thing works.  As he begins to put the pieces together, more and more horrific things happen to those closest to him.  In the early going, he is aided by David Warner as a photographer who first notices something amiss.  (I remember that Warner's rather graphic fate caused quite a stir 2o years ago...while we've seen worse on CSI: MIAMI since then, the scene is still remarkably affective.)

Everyone in the film is great.  Peck is the anchor, but Billie Whitelaw as the ""nursemaid"" who comes to take care of little Damian is a powerful presence.  She's a well-known British theatre actress, and she brings her steely power to the role and is the true villain.  While it may be that Damian is the devil's child...he's only a tiny kid in the film.  If we were actually supposed to fear and loathe this child, the movie wouldn't work.  We'd either think it was exploitative or silly.  But while he IS bad, he is still being manipulated by others.  Even the terrific scene where he ""bumps"" into his mother by the upstairs banister (WHAT A GREAT SCENE!) is being directed by Whitelaw and the kid is just her pawn.  He seems unaware of who he is.

Lee Remick as wife and mother has an underwritten role, but she does horrified well.  Another classic scene involves the drive she and Damian take through an animal park...which causes quite a stir amongst the baboons.  Imagine fifty crazed baboons throwing themselves at your car!  Again, it's a scene that could have been silly, but the filmmakers handled it in a non-ironic way, and it is creepy.  (The filmmakers never attempt special effects that were beyond the achievable...so while there's nothing fancy compared to what could be done with CGI today...there's also very little that doesn't look believable.)  David Warner is effective in his smallish but important role.

In some ways, the film plays like an episode of The X-Files...the supernatural wrapped up into a more conventional mystery/investigation story that gets weirder as it goes along.  But at the core is a layer of sadness.  Peck and Remick have been deprived of their biological child and given this heavy burden in its place...a child that must be destroyed.  We feel the sadness in Peck...not just the fear and horror.  That measure of empathy is what is missing in some many horror movies today...now we like to wink at the camera and acknowledge how silly what we're doing is.  Yet the best horror movies are still the ones that play it straight...that believe we are still capable of being creeped out.

I found watching THE OMEN to be a very pleasant surprise.  If you haven't seen it in awhile...it's still holding up well.  And if you've never seen it, I think you might be surprised that a 25 year old film can still raise some serious goosebumps even now.  (By the way, the ""R"" rating would be a ""PG13"" today.  Judge accordingly.)",1128470400,4,3967,4.666666666666667

Demian is the legitimate son of an American Ambassador (Gregory Peck)who at first can not accept that awful truth but gradually the overwhelming weight of the evidence will convince him. His wife (the unforgettable and beautiful Lee Remick) eventually will be one of the fatal designees of the satanic majesty.

This smart script caught the febrile imagination of a great audience who, having been spelling by The Exorcist two years ago, expected a new kind of terror. The names of George Romero (The night of the living dead)or Dario Argento (The cat with nine tails) remained in atmosphere zero, due the market exigencies demanded supernatural origin.

This movie also catapulted to Sam Neil who made an absorbing embodiment of this malefic creature in human form.

Demian will survive despite all the efforts of his own father, after he got all the evidences to find him guilty and made his own justice .

The special effects were astonishing. We still remember the priest `s death fulminated in front of the church; and the decapitation of the Second priest who had found important clues to eliminate Demian The impressive sequence in the cemetery in Rome's surroundings still remains a classic.

Cast:  Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw, Harvey Stephens, Patrick Troughton.

Running Time:  111 minutes.

Rated R for violence, language, and one gruesome decapitation scene.

Directed by a young Richard Donner (prior to his successes with ""Superman"" and the ""Lethal Weapon"" series), this supernatural/religious thriller is astonishing, intense, and frighteningly dark.  On the night of a terrible mishap during his son's birth, ambassador Robert Thorn learns that he will be not become a father unless he agrees to an emergency adoption that only he will ever know about.  All seems well with the cute little Damien until the Thorns notice some abnormalities with their son.  Beyond the aberations, everyone that comes into contact with the child eventually ends up dead or deranged.  With the help from a curious photographer (David Warner in a fine role), Thorn attempts to understand the true satanic evil of his son.

Donner uses the newly created ""Jaws"" Spielberg-scheme to draw viewers into the film ever so slightly, scene by scene, and eventually unloads an onslaught of horror and macabre with the second half of the film.  Acting juggernauts Peck and Remick are only adequate in their roles, for Harvey Stephens as Damien certainly steals the show.  A superb musical score from the great Jerry Goldsmith paces the film and intertwines visual terror with auditory atmosphere.  Superb cinematography and a riveting climax.  Does not equal ""The Exorcist"" in religious symbolism or significance, but still extremely effective and entertaining.  Outside of ""Prom Night"", ""The Omen"" possesses the best decapitation in a horror film of all time.  Sleek, stylish supernatural horror.",1117584000,2,1737,5.417910447761194
279433,4,6300247104,"You've, I imagine, read all the other reviews, so I won't recount the plot of this movie. Rather, I will add, as sort of a ""caveat,"" that I saw this movie on July 4, 1976, with my brother's (then) fiance and her best friend.  I was in the Army at the time, on leave, and I'd just returned from visting an old Army buddy in S Carolina.  As a parting gesture, he'd provided me with a (as the late great prototype for ""Uncle Duke"" would say) ""whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, screamers, etc"" - and we three helped ourselves liberally before viewing ""The Omen.""  Oh boy...about 10 minutes in (about the time the nurse hangs herself), the vibrations started getting a little...nasty, and by the time the photographer ""lost his head,"" all thoughts of a cozy ""Fourth Of July threesome"" after the movie were thoroughly dissippated.  And I, thereafter in the pouring rain, emptied my ""stash"" with an (at the time) tearful vow to forgo any pleasures of the flesh henceforth - and I slept, in my Parents' living room with the light on all night, until I returned to ""active duty,"" where sleep was a bit of a...rare commodity.  I kept my promise, oh, 3 months, but I'll never forget the FEAR that ""The Omen"" instilled in three libidinous proto-yuppies.  ""Damien"" kind of ran out of steam, But Sam Neill in ""The Final Conflict"" restored the series to its downright ""scares the mortal %^&* out of one."" OK, that being said, ""The Omen"" is scary, not only because of its ""horror film"" schtick, but because it's (more or less) Biblically correct.  Remember: who/whatever the prorotype of ""Damien"" is, he's out there right now, folks.  That's what gives these movies, nascent though they may be, CREDIBILITY.",1116806400,2,1714,4.728187919463087
279434,4,6300247104,"This is one of my favorite horror movies. It's got plenty of scares but it's real power lies in it's sense of dread and that creepy music. The Thornes have been set up and the whole movie is a race to see if they will figure it out in time.

You can watch the movie over and over again and notice different little things each time. Having Kathy Thorne be emotionally unstable was a very nice touch. Her instincts tell her that something is wrong with Damien but because of her previous worries she figures it's just in her mind.

 It was also interesting how Damien goes after the weakest members of the family first: Kathy and her unborn baby. His terribly violent attack on Kathy at the church and the horrified expressions of the onlookers were brilliantly filmed. The trip to the zoo was a great scene too. Notice how all animals except the demonic dogs flip out in the presence of the little boy?

The movie also drops subtle hints that lil' Damien knows what he is. The way he interacts with the nanny, the dog and how once the nanny moves in his attitude towards mommy seems to change and his last words to Robert Thorne seem like an attempt to manipulate him and of course, there's the famous last scene and his big smile while looking triumphantly into the camera.

Another nice touch: Thorne and the reporter quickly become real friends, something that Thorne desperately needs. You actually like the reporter (despite those clothes and that hellified haircut)and are sorry to see him get dispatched.  The trip to the cemetary is a great section. It has very little gore. The horror is in the ugliness and ruin of the cemetary, it's in the way the moonlight shines on the two skeletons, the expression on the reporter's face when he looks up and sees the dogs and in the pain in Thorne's voice.

Later he finds out about Kathy's last dive at the hospital and momentarily crumbles. Everything he loved is dead in the cemetary or dead in London. His logical ordered world has just gone to hell.

Okay, there are some tiny little flaws. England hasn't been a really important ally for decades but being ambassador there is sitll a big deal. How could the devil nanny dismiss the entire staff of the ambassador's residence without it being in the newspapers? In real life Cleo Noel, ambassador to Sudan was murdered a few years earlier. No US ambassador could traipse around unnoticed and without security the way Thorne does. I'm assuming  he was able to carry the knives on the plane becuase of his diplomatic ID but surely not on his lap? There should have been a scene with other passengers looking at him nervously.

Those are little nitpicks and they don't really affect the movie. Enjoy. Omen is just as creepy now as it ever was.",1101513600,4,2743,4.5682281059063135

279436,5,6300247104,"Richard Donner's classic horror film ""The Omen"" scared the heck out of me when I saw it at 16. I hadn't seen ""The Exorcist"" yet (although I did see it the next year). This supernatural horror film creates a sense of forebodding and craftsmanship that many film directors have forgotten how to do. Featuring a powerful performance by the late Gregory Peck (whom I met once and what did I ask him about? Not ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""Spellbound"" two other films I admire. No, I had to ask him about shooting ""The Omen"" silly 21 year old that I was)and a sharp, powerful score by Jerry Goldsmith, ""The Omen"" continues to horrorify to this day because of the craft that went into making the film.

We open on June 6, 1976 a US diplomat Robert Thorn (Peck)rushes through Rome to get to the hospital as his pregnant wife Katherine(Lee Remick in another nicely textured performance)goes into labor. Their son is stillborn but the priest at the Catholic hosptial offers to let Thorn adopt a child whose mother has died at the hospital. What he doesn't know is that the child is the anti-Christ bearing the Number of the Beast (666).

After Damien reaches his fifth birthday, strange things begin to happen including the death of many around the boy. The Thorns take in a new very strange nanny (Billie Whitelaw)into their home. Things go from bad to worse for the Thorns and all those around them as the boy discovers his destiny.

This new anamorphic widescreen transfer looks marvelous. There's a number of terrific extras including a 45 minute documentary on the making of the movie featuring new interviews with some of the cast and crew. There's also a great commentary track from director Donner and editor Stuart Baird. The late Jerry Goldsmith provides interesting insights in a short featurette where he discusses his favorite musical themes from the film (which was nominate for an Academy Award).There's also the original theatrical trailer and a new stereo mix of the soundtrack.

To tell you the truth...

this movie traumatized me beyond any sense of comprehension.

I can't explain why.

The opening credits... the boy and the cross as his shadow.  The nanny being hypnotized by a lingering Rottweiler into dramatically hanging herself in front of an audience at a child's birthday party.  A priest ridiculously impaled by a steeple as he's desperately trying to change his fate.  A mother who is torn by the possibility of her strange intuition bringing her to the brink of insanity.  Bruised and beaten by her 5-year-old when he refused to enter the church.  Knocked off of a ladder by her son riding a tricycle (this was later mocked in the TV series ""Family Guy"")... gripping onto the handrail... staring into his eyes, pleading with him to save her life... only to fall and miscarriage.  The Graveyard - the most horrific scene of the movie... a pack of hellhounds gather and chase.  A frightening decapitation... and finally, the attempted destruction at the Altar.

279439,5,6300247104,"The Omen was the first ""non-slasher"" horror movie my (then) young eyes ever beheld and remains a favorite even today. Part murder mystery, part very accurate biblical prophecy, The Omen combines a unique story, a wonderful spooky atmosphere, an incredible soundtrack and top notch performances from a gallery of stars to arrive at an intelligent thriller, all for a budget of $2.8 million.

Gregory Peck is Robert Thorn, a U.S. Diplomat whos wife Katherine, ably played by the late Lee Remick, has just given birth to their first son. Unfortunately, the child is stillborn and Thorn agrees to substitute another child to spare his mentally unstable wife anguish. Shortly afterward, Thorn is made Ambassador to England (the Court of Saint James) and they move into a wonderful old historic mansion. The fun begins.

By any account, Damien (Harvey Stephens in his only role), is a beautiful child. Dark haired, adorable and possessing an enchanting smile, the little bundle of joy seems anything but the hellraiser he's about to become. Into the picture walks Keith Jennings, affably characterized by perennial villain David Warner. He's a news photographer who can't seem to stop damaging the emulsion on his photo's of the Thorn's. He attends Jesus Chris... uh, Damien's fifth birthday party to make sure he gets some snapshots of the tyke's nanny (a cameo by Holly Palance and thankfully not Fran Drescher.) Good thing, because she hangs herself and destroys a really nice window minutes later. Oddly enough, dark lines appear on the nanny's photo. Our expert photog initially thinks it's a flaw, and doesn't bother to look at the negative. Then it occurs to him that this line resembles the noose that's helping keep Andersen in business.

Clues to Damien's past trickle in. A priest, the late great Patrick Troughton (Dr. Who), who claims he was present at Damien's birth. Naturally, he gets cut off by security just as he is about to reveal who our bad boy's mother is. He walks away after being tossed out only to be photographed by our intrepid reporter. Guess what? The Doctor's (uh, Father Brennan's) photo has a line in it too. This one's pointing to his shoulder.

In the meantime, the Thorn's need a new nanny. Enter Mrs. Baylock (a stern English Billie Whitelaw) who mysteriously appears at the Thorn's door. Mary Poppins she ain't. Right after storming into the lives of our troubled diplomats, she barges into our demonic tyke's room, closes the door and tells him ""I have come to protect thee"". She then proceeds to dismiss the staff and drag a rotweiller into the house. A science teacher told me ages ago this was the movie that gave the breed a bad reputation. They actually have much more stable personalities than Doberman pinchers which are a cross between rotweillers and greyhounds. The one thing Nanny from Hell fails at is stopping Damien from attending a wedding with his ""mom"" and ""dad"". In a rather harrowing scene, Damien completely freaks out at the sight of the church and attacks Katherine. How Richard Donner got such an incredible performance out of a five year old, I don't know. But the look on his face as they drive to the church is priceless.

Robert starts to have a glimmer of a doubt. He thinks it's strange that little Damien has never been sick a day in his life. Katherine, of course, just brushes it off. Robert gets called on again by the mad priest who spouts some biblical verse and tells Thorn to do all those things you learn about in Catholic school. He's just in time. As Thorn storms off, the weather acts up (it's England, after all) and Papa Brennan seeks refuge in a local church. As he pounds on the door, a bolt of lightning strikes a metal pole on a steeple which falls and impales him through his shoulder. Hopefully our intrepid reporter is paying attention.

Katherine is healed from Damien's attack and takes him to the zoo. The animals seem to know better than the people, because everyone that so much as lays eyes on the tyke runs away. When they drive through the baboons, they attack ""mom's"" car. At the same time, our intrepid reporter has fared better than our intrepid priest at attracting the ambassador's attention. In fact, they seem to be on the way to becoming fast friends. Through some connections with the local constabulary, they gain access to the dead Father's apartment, only to find it wall papered with pages of the bible. He's nuts! Or is he? Jennings explains his concerns about the photographs. Thorn asks why he should care. Jennings shows him a photograph of himself he caught in the priest's mirror. There's a slash through his neck! He's also managed to get a photo of the priest's autopsy. They found a little 666 on the priest's thigh. It's a birthmark!

Katherine must be the unluckiest mother in the world. She falls victim to yet another of the Anti-Christ's pranks when he knocks her off a balcony with his tricycle. Now she's in the hospital with internal bleeding, and multiple fractures. Oh my God! She was pregnant! Was being the operative word. And here they thought she couldn't have more children. What's up with that.

Now the situation starts to heat up. Thorn wants to know what's going on. At a moment's notice, Thorn and intrepid report fly to Italy to investigate. They go to the hospital where Damien was born. Uh, oh. It seems the original hospital burned down. And the fire started in the records room. A nun manages to remember who the attending priest was. He was badly injured in the fire, but does direct them to the cemetery where they believe answers lie among the corpses. They do. Thorns real son is buried there with a big hole in his skull. The birth went fine. They murdered the boy as he was born. They open his ""mother's"" grave only to find a animal skeleton. (In the sequel, you find out this really was his mother.) Oh, no. Katherine's in danger. Thorn phones her and tells her to leave just as anti-Mary Poppins pushes her out the window through the roof of an ambulance a few floors below.

Now Thorn is pissed. Who was that guy the nutzo priest told him to see? Leo McKern, that's who. A quick trip to the Middle East yields a set of daggers that Thorn's gotta plug into his demon boy's body. Hey, wait a minute. What about that picture Jennings took of his neck? Not to worry, in a fit of doubt, Thorn throws the daggers away and Jennings goes to retrieve them. A piece of glass sliding off a truck nicely decapitates intrepid reporter. Thorn flies back to England and Israeli airport security has overlooked the seven weapons he's holding in his lap.

The climax is nearly here. To prove to himself once and for all that his ""son"" is the prince of darkness, he starts cutting the kid's hair to find the 666 mark on his scalp. Time to drag the son of Satan to church and finish him off. There's one last obstacle. Mary Poppin's evil twin isn't about to let this happen. She attacks him with a bunch of kitchen implements and he has to run over her with his car to get her off his back.

Well Thorn has the boy at the church, right on the altar and is about to do away with him. The best laid plans of mice and men... He gets shot by a local policeman before he can do the deed. The last shot is of Damien's smile at the funeral.

Despite my lighthearted summary, this is an excellent film. I never tire of watching it. The sequels, while enjoyable, do not live up to original film. Lee Remick, in particular gives a stellar performance as the unstable wife torn between the duties of a diplomats wife, a loving mother, and the feeling that something just isn't right. Peck and Remick also have great chemistry on screen. You can really sense that these two love each other. There are true romantic moments buried in between the thrills.

The DVD is packed with some great extras. For the first time, you have a brief interview with the soundtrack composer, Jerry Goldsmith, and hear the inspiration for his creepy and romantic music. By the way, he won an Oscar for his efforts.

There is a 46 minute documentary with many of the crew including the director and religious advisor, and a short piece about a series of accidents that occurred during the filming.

279480,5,6300247104,"1976's ""The Omen"" has always been my favorite horor film of all time. I found it more frightening than ""Halloween"", ""Friday The Thirteenth"" or even ""The Excocist"", simply because it does not frighten you with blood and gore (despite bloodshed every now and then). It is meant to frighten you with the plot, which, while fictional, seems disturbingly realistic.
""The Omen"" stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as Robert and Kathy Thorn, wealthy political figures who have everything they want... except a child. When Kathy unknowingly gives birth to a stillborn baby, Robert quickly adopts another child in place of the real child, which Kathy apparently never finds out about. Young Damien seems like the perfect child, but strange mortalities soon arise when Damien turns five. First, his nanny hangs herself at his 5th birthday. Next, a priest who tries to watn Peck about his son's birth mother is impaled by a lightning rod. These strange deaths attract the attention of a photographer, ably played by the grossly underrated David Warner. Together, Warner and Peck go looking for Damien's real mother. A new nanny, played with fervor by Billie Whitelaw, comes along, knowing who Damien really is. Remick's character soon suffers a miscarriage, and she and the photographer both meet an untimely end. Peck receives seven daggers from an aging archeologist named Bugenhagen. Peck then realizes his son's true identity, building up to a terrifying closing sequence.

THe story-line revolves around a US ambassador to Great Britain whose wife gives birth to a supposed stillborn baby, so out of desperation, he secretly adopts another newborn. The baby is normal until his fifth birthday when his nanny hangs herself at his birthday party *in a very disturbing scene.* Another nanny takes her place who happens to be the nanny from Hell *literally!* Death ensues in some of the goriest death scenes of the time period.

279483,5,6300247104,"Even though ""The Omen"" spawned countless copycats and its own less than perfect sequels, it is one of the eeriest and most suspenseful films of this genre.  Director Richard Donner uses extremely moody and malevolent atmospherics to form the backdrop for this tale of the birth of the Anti-Christ.  One of the scariest and most disturbing is the death of Patrick Troughton, who plays the errant priest who tries to warn Robert Thorne of his disastrous son.  The wind howling in the park, the intensity of Troughton's manic performance and the final impaling is outstandingly filmed.  Other classic moments:  the look on Lee Remick's face when she realizes what her nanny has done; the terror in Damien's fear of going to church; the attack of the baboons in the drive through park; the awful moment when Remick tumbles off the second story of her house, and even more in her fall from the hospital window; Billie Whitelaw's animalistic attack on Peck to preserve the Antichrist; and of course, the awful fate awaiting David Warner via a plate glass.  And the scene in the graveyard with its music and ferocious barking Rotweiler's---wow, this is suspense at its finest.
Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar winning score is perfect, and the cast is superb.  Gregory Peck and Lee Remick bring a professional dignity to their performances; never overacting, never underacting; their class is evident and it's a shame we've lost these two brilliant performers.

279484,3,6300247104,"The whole plot of THE OMEN revolves around the idea of the anti-Christ growing up and living amongst us, unknown to anyone until it's too late. The premise of the film is somewhat interesting, and was a fairly new concept when the movie was released, but has become common place nowadays. The ""scariness"" of THE OMEN isn't in blood and guts, but in the shock value: we barely see a nanny hang herself outdoors from a window, but it is shocking; we've been told that Damien's mother was a jackal so when his adopted father searches the grave, we shouldn't be shocked, but we are; the newspaper photographer already showed us how he would die, but when it happens it is a bit shocking. The film really is dated now, but it contains a couple of gems, mainly the soundtrack and Gregory Peck. The movie probably isn't as spooky as it was originally, but it's still an interesting film to watch.",1070323200,2,889,4.527950310559007
279485,2,6300247104,"Those who first saw THE OMEN back in 1976 were swept away more by the theme of the anti-Christ reborn than by any high quality production values.  Only a few years ealier, THE EXORCIST had made its huge splash with its own devilish content, and comparisons with THE OMEN were inevitable.  A comparison between THE EXORCIST's Regan and THE OMEN's Damien are helpful in fixing why the former rings true even today while the latter is seen mostly as a period piece whose shock value has diminished over the last quarter century.  Regan generated empathy and sympathy as a young girl whose demonic possession made the audience feel the angst that both she and her mother endured during the transformation scenes.  With Damien, there were no such transformation scenes.  He is born of the devil, lives as the devil, and rules as the devil.  This is a straight line development that does not allow the viewer to build up any feeling for him.  Either he will rule as the anti-Christ or he will be stopped.  Since the audience does not care much one way or the other, the dramatic focus is on sound effects and creepy background shots.  In nearly every other scene, director Richard Donner has one actor or another intone in the most solemn of notes a never ending series of biblical quotes, the purpose of which is to justify the ascension of the devil-child.  Allied to this is Donner's use of what an earlier generation used to call the heavenly chorus.  In family oriented films like MRS.MINIVER, a church chorus resounded a spiritually uplifting paen to hope and morality.  In THE OMEN, this chorus has morphed into its demonic variant that resoundingly pervades nearly each scene that indicates some new piece of the infernal puzzle.  Consider the major scenes of interest: the suicide of Damien's babysitter, the near entrance of Damien into a church, the decapitation of a photographer, and the ubiquitous presence of Damien's devil dog bodyguard.  Each of these scenes is accompanied by an ear-numbing chorus that reminds the viewer that something infernal is afoot.  What all these biblical allusions and sound effects add up to is a failure on the part of cast and crew to establish the legitimacy of the devil-child to stand up on his own, unpropped by such obvious and heavy-handed immoral shortcuts.
Gregory Peck is Ambassador Thorn, who here, thinks that the best way to show an increasing concern that his baby son is not what he seems to be is to show an ossified face that allows only for the uplifting of an eyebrow to register emotion.  Lee Remick as Damien's surrogate mother is only marginally more convincing.  Billie Whitelaw as Damien's nanny is as flat a character as I have ever seen.  Her only purpose is to protect Damien, and in that she is indistinguishable from their protective Doberman.
The shock value of THE OMEN is, of course, the primary reason for its financial success.  Coming so soon after the impact of THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN merely rechanneled another avenue of demonic celluloid possession for movie goers to travel.  THE OMEN is covered with a suffocating blanket of predestined biblical apocalypse that renders it devoid of any leavening sense of joy or even escape from the certainty that when the devil really does take over, the world will be little more than a loud, morally crushing universe in which the anti-Christ continues to spout passages from the bible in waves that exceed our normal Sunday pulpits.  When I see any film, I like to exit the theater feeling either uplifted or educated.  With THE OMEN, I felt neither.",1067904000,3,3569,4.81639344262295

279487,5,6300247104,"When I first saw this movie I just could not believe how well it had been put together by director Richard Donnor. Harvey Stephens was the perfect choice to play Damien ""cute but evil"". The Scene where he looks at the dog and waves is just a classic!, and then there is the score...Jerry Goldsmith won a well deserved oscar for this movie in which he created two excellent themes ""Ave Satani"" and ""Piper Dreams"" which carry this movie along with brilliance.
I was only slighty disappointed by this DVD.
Even though the picture looked better then it had ever looked before it was still not up to scratch with traces of dust still visable on the print etc.
I thought the New Stereo mix was a vast improvement over the boring original mono track, adding more depth to Goldsmith's score but it was still not good enough (It deserved a full 5.1 Remix)
The features on this DVD are interesting and add story to how The Omen came about and you also get the theatrical trailer and a rather good commentary track by Richard Donnor.
People always try to compare this film to ""The Exorcist"" why???..The Exorcist is a classic all on it's own, So what it came out first (big deal!)
The Omen has one thing The Exorcist does not ""a classic score"" The Exorcist used Tubular Bells ""That was not written for The Exorcist"" (It became famous because of it).
This movie is a horror classic and will remain a classic for many years to come.",1067126400,4,1418,4.478764478764479
279488,5,6300247104,"When The Exorcist was released in 1973 the world stood in awe at the horror and gore than was presented before their very eyes. Rip-offs came thick and fast and then came the masterpiece The Omen. This 1976 horror film scored a hit with both critics and cinema-goers alike who had embraced a deep interest in gothic horror and its history. It has a first-rate cast, superb acting, brilliant shock tactics and a soundtrack to send shivers down your spine whatever your state of mind! It's no wonder Jerry Goldsmith won an Academy Award as the composer of the theme! I first saw this film last night when it was shown on UK TV. My mum recommended it to me, as it was a favourite of hers as a teenager and I absolutely loved it.

In The Omen, Katherine (Lee Remick) and Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) are a rich married couple who move to England from America. Katherine is pregnant and gives birth to an ostensibly baby boy while in Italy. This news is kept from her. Her husband knows how much his wife has wanted a baby and the problems she had conceiving, so he agrees to have the dead new-born supplanted by another new-born, whose mother died at child birth. Katherine thinks that the child is her own, but Robert knows it's not and keeps this a secret from her. They name the baby Damien (Harvey Stephens).

Five years pass and we see the family growing up joyfully in their big mansion. They're happy and content with their lives and love their son more than anything. Everything is going well for the Thorn family until Damien turns five. A series of very creepy and unexplainable events happen around the time of his fifth birthday, which all seem to stem from Damien. The family employ a creepy and weird nanny (Billie Whitelaw) and things begin to spiral out of control. Robert and Katherine really start to think that there is something seriously wrong with their child so, with the help of a funny photographer (David Warner), Robert sets out to try and discover the truth about the mysterious events. A stubborn priest tries to warn him when these events happen, but Robert doesn't listen. It soon becomes too late when the man is murdered rather spectacularly.

The horror of this film is based more on the shock tactics more so than the suspense factor, which doesn't make it a very scary film in terms of blood and guts, but more so in the way that it disturbs you deep down and shocks your body. The first big shock of the film comes on Damien's fifth birthday party when his nanny jumps from the top of the mansion roof screaming, ""It's all for you Damien!"" before hanging herself. Another shock comes when Damien goes hysterical as he nears a church in a car with is mother and father. He later drives his tricycle into his mother's stool as she is doing housework on a balcony. She falls and loses her second baby. Her long stint in hospital tears Robert apart, and her death after she is pushed out of a hospital window tips him over the edge. The death of the priest by a Church-spear is not only shocking, but rather humorous. The scenes in Italy with dogs and spikes and broken arms are spectacular, but the most famous scene comes when the photographer is decapitated by a sheet of glass that slides off the back of a truck which rolls down the hill towards him. A scene that has gone down in history!

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

The Omen can be a tad boring in between the shocking scenes and good parts of the storyline, but the ending is ten minutes of pure cinema brilliance. The scenes of Robert trying to cope with the world crumbling around him are also pure cinema gold, and shows a wonderfully emotional side to Peck's acting. Caught in a tornado of events of which he cannot control, he sweeps the audience along with him. David Seltzer wrote an awesome script, while Richard Donner works finely and precisely on directing this masterpiece. Essential viewing for all those who love gothic horror and truly great thrillers.",1067126400,24,3948,4.554929577464788

279559,5,6300247104,"Comparisons to Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist were destined to this film simply because say ""oh it's got the devil in it."" Well I won't compare the two, but I will say that The Omen is scarier than Rosemary's Baby, but it can't touch The Exorcist. After The Exorcist sparked a lengthy trend of supernatural thrillers, this 1976 horror film scored a hit with critics and audiences for mixing gothic horror and mystery into its plot about a young boy suspected of being the personification of the anti-Christ. Directed by Richard Donner The Omen gained a lot of credibility from the casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick. The plot is a distinguished American couple living in England, whose young son Damien bears ""the mark of the beast."" Mysterious deaths and unexplained incidents draw the attention of a photographer, whose investigation leads to the young boy and also to the photographer's shocking decapitation At a time when graphic gore had yet to dominate the horror genre, this film used its violence discreetly and to great effect, and the mood of dread and potential death is masterfully maintained. Many viewers try to compare it to The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, but don't. Most people find The Exorcist much scarier than The Omen, and many find Rosemary's Baby scarier than the omen, so in the future don't do that. You get there hopes up, and sadly they won't be met. If someone say that the scariest movie ever is [insert movie] and someone else says, ""no [insert movie] is the scariest,"" then you have just made that person biased to the film that you deemed the scariest and they'll not find it any good. People try to sound smart by saying ""oh the exorcist just tries to shock you, and educated people prefer no blood guts or shocks."" Sorry The Exorcist also had alot of subtle horror and psychological horror and to fill in the gaps and give the film that little extra something, they provided shocks to offend and scare people. But in this day and age everyone's a critic and if a movie doesn't move a lightning speed and is filled will gross effects and computer imagery it can't be deemed scary. The worse thing about classics like these is that people watch them with the mind set of ""oh it's and older flick so this can't be scary."" People are teased about being scared in older horror films and that's not a good thing. Another thing is, if you have kids who are asking questions about horror films, don't say ""the scariest movie ever is [insert movie],"" cuz due to the rebellious nature of youth they will take the opposite of everything you say and do. So if you don't fall into those catagory's and have the guts to take the criticism and watch it alone in the dark, then you have earned my respect. But I will say this, your kids won't find this any good at all, simply cuz it's an older one and they simply don't know or get how to view films like these. But what do you expect with movies like Scream and I Know what You did Last Summer out there. And of course the latest trend of ""being stupid is funny and cool."" So this classic will die away and stupid un-scary films like Scream, and Silence of the Lambs are taking over. Oh well hollywood sux and so does pop culture.

279561,5,6300247104,"Following THE EXORCIST, the devil seemed to be everywhere.  Especially in children!  THE OMEN has no ties to that production, but makes the perfect sequel!  Where Linda Blair was just temporarily a vessel for a demon, here we have a small boy who may or may not be the son of the devil himself!  THE OMEN originally relied on the mystery of whether or not this child was evil, or was it all irrational fears of parents who begin to realize their child is not quite the little angel they were hoping for.  Richard Donner directs, and Jerry Goldsmith scored - making an unbeatable team to deliver a creepy mystery helmed by Gregory Peck and Lee Remick.  Billie Whitelaw played Damien, and he captures innocent evil perfectly.  It's a thinking person's horror movie!  More goosebumps than outright screams, but perfectly crafted.  The DVD features a stunning transfer, and an entertaining commentary by Donner and Stuart Baird.  Documentaries round out the disc with pieces discussing Biblical references and a curse that seemed to surround the production with supernatural misfortunes.  Also Jerry Goldsmith discusses one of his most effective scores!  They don't make them like this anymore, and it's a shame.

279563,5,6300247104,"The Omen is a great movie, but what I want to talk about is the commentary part of the disc; Even if you're not the type who usually cares to listen to commentaries, this one is worth it. Director Richard Donner  and Stuart Baird, the editor sit down for a leisurely chat about the making of the film.  The commentary adds a lot, and makes you appreciate the film even more.  One thing that particularly comes through is how much of a role the casting played in the film, and how the COMMITMENT of the cast mattered so much.  In the hands of lesser talents, The Omen could have come off as so much camp, but director Donner chose people who could play it straight and who would feel, not so much that they're in a ""horror"" picture, but more of a psychological suspense thriller.  And it worked. From the leads, (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, Billie Whitelaw, David Warner) all the way down to the bit players (Leo McKern) the actors are totally credible and interwoven into the story. Donner and Baird lavish praise even on certain actors who had only one or two lines! They're pretty funny, making light-hearted fun of the arguments Thorn has with Mrs. Blaylock, but even in their joking you realize that Peck/Thorn is at the center of the film and its his relationships with other characters (Remick, Whitelaw, Warner, and little Harvey Stephens) that drives this film as opposed to blood and gore.
That's what's at the heart of the film; the timeless story of a man battling seemingly insurmountable odds. Donner and Baird praise their own work too, as well as the cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score. And they never stop reminding us that the whole shebang cost $2.25M, a low budget even by 70's standards.
The ending is pretty comedic too; Donner jokes about telling Harvey/Damien not to smile at the end of the film (""Don't you smile Harvey!""), but in fact, both Donner and the audience know that it's Harvey's innocent smile while holding the hand of the President of the United States, that puts the perfect capper on the film.

279567,4,6300247104,"Interpretting the Scripture in the Book of Revelation, ""The Omen"" is a frightening, intelligent and provocative look at the rise of the anti-Christ, the biblical entity prophecized to lead mankind into his final apocalyptic battle, and its writing is so magnificent to make the viewer a believer. Gregory Peck is, as usual, superb as the unwitting accomplice to unleashing the anti-Christ onto man. His character, Robert Thorne, is U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James, appointed long after he unknowningly enters into a pact with the Devil himself to hide from his unsuspecting wife, Lee Remick, that the child they were expecting died at birth (later we learn the newborn was murdered). Peck is tremendous when he learns his pseudo-son is actually the son of Satan and the implication of that fact on the world, and Remick unsettlingly realistic as the slightly disturbed mother. British actress Billie Whitelaw, though, turns in a star performance as the protector of Satan's offspring, and the evil of her character is so superb that the viewer thoroughly enjoys watching her get hers in the end. That this film creates true discomfort watching it is the mark of a superb production, and ""The Omen"" fits the bill. As for its two sequels, forget them!

279618,5,6300247104,"One of the most commercially and artistically successful horror films of modern times, the 1976 thriller THE OMEN cagily rode the wave of Satanic thrillers spawned by ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE EXORCIST.  Indeed these three films form a devilish cinematic trinity of terror.  Although often compared to THE EXORCIST, which it followed by two and a half years, THE OMEN differs from that 1973 shocker by being propelled more by narrative invention than by elaborately disgusting special effects.  It is a very disturbing film even to this day, more than a quarter century since its June 1976 release.
Gregory Peck and Lee Remick lend an air of respectability as the U.S. ambassador to England and his wife who adopt a baby boy named Damien, following what would appear at first to be a miscarriage.  Five years later, however, things take a rapid and bizarre turn.  Damien's nanny (Holly Palance) hangs herself during the child's birthday party; and not long after, she is replaced by a Satanic nanny (Billie Whitelaw) and a vicious mastif dog.  A seemingly manic priest (Patrick Troughton) gives Peck scriptural warnings about Damien, which Peck disbelieves; not long after, Troughton is impaled by a church spire during a storm.
Only when a journalist (David Warner) shows him pictures in which these horrible events seem to have a connection does Peck begin to realize that the child he has may not even be real.  His suspicions are heightened when Remick suffers a suspicious fall at home and is laid up in bed.  And later on, when Whitelaw engineers her death, he comes to realize that Damien is in fact the Antichrist (Devil's Child) as foretold in the Book of Revelations.  An exorcist (Leo McKern) tells him he must kill Damien in a church, but his conscience won't let him; and only after Warner is killed in the film's infamous decapitation scene does Peck attempt to go through with it.  The result is a suspenseful and disquieting conclusion.
Brilliantly directed by then first-timer Richard Donner (who later made SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and LETHAL WEAPON) and ingeniously scripted by David Seltzer, THE OMEN was, like ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE EXORCIST before it, a very controversial movie amongst the religious Right in America for its alleged advocation of worshippers of Satan.  Such is hardly the case for either three movies, of course; and the controversy only helped boost their box office might.  THE OMEN, for instance, made for just over $2 million, has since grossed close to sixty million dollars.
The reasons for this are clear.  Peck and Remick, fine actors both, are highly credible as the parents of a child they don't know anything about.  Harvey Stephens is chilling as Damien, as is Whitelaw as his sinister nanny.  Warner is also good as the journalist.  As mentioned before, THE OMEN is more a matter of plot than of shocking effects.  The decapitation scene, however, is still quite horrific and gruesome after all these years; and Troughton's impalement is just as jarring.  All of this is elevated further by Jerry Goldsmith's sinister and Oscar-winning choral/orchestral score, which sounds like a combination of many different elements; Gregorian chants, Berlioz, Stravinsky, Bernard Herrmann, and even Carl Orff's ""Carmina Burana.""
Although followed by three increasingly ludicrous sequels, THE OMEN is still a highly-charged horror masterpiece at a time when horror films were still made with terrifying an audience, as opposed to mortifying them.  If classic horror is your bag, THE OMEN is as good a place as any to start.",1031270400,5,3557,5.039249146757679

279622,5,6300247104,"This is a first class, gothic chiller with an outstanding cast, a riveting story line,  and a musical score that will make the viewer want to sleep with the lights on! A first rate film, it had audiences riveted to the screen when it was first released in the mid nineteen seventies. I know. I was one of that audience. This film has withstood the test of time, as it is as gripping today, as when it was first released.

Katherine (Lee Remick) and Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) are a wealthy, older American couple. Katherine is pregnant and, while in Italy, gives birth to an ostensibly stillborn boy, a fact that is kept from her. Knowing how much his wife wanted the baby and the difficulty that she had in conceiving, Robert agrees to have the dead baby supplanted by a living newborn whose mother died in child birth, keeping this information from Katherine. They name this baby Damien.

All goes well for the prosperous  Thorn family, until Damien turns five. A series of dramatic, unusual events begin to occur around the Thorns, all seemingly stemming from Damien. Well guarded by a self sufficient, somewhat creepy nanny (Billie Whitelaw), there are those who would believe him to be the Antichrist. By the time that Katherine and Robert begin to realize who Damien may truly be, their lives are out of control. With the aid of an inquisitive  photographer, a repentant priest, and an archaeologist who holds the key to the destruction of the Antichrist, Robert Thorn becomes a man with a mission. Will Damien let him complete that mission? Watch this movie and find out. You will not be disappointed. I guarantee that you will be sleeping with the lights on and the covers over your head.

David Seltzer wrote a terrific screenplay. This first class production, which is deftly directed by Richard Donner, is played with straightforward sincerity by its outstanding cast. The casting of Gregory Peck and Lee Remick was pure genius, as their distinguished reputations infused the movie with a believability not thought possible, given the theme of the script. Playing it straight, as a couple caught in a vortex of events over which they have little control, they sweep the viewer along with them. Supported by a fine cast, there are notable performances given by Billie Whitelaw, as the nanny with a mission,  David Warner, as the photographer who begins to notice that something odd seems to be going on, and Harvey Stephens, as Damien, whose angelic countenance belies his satanic nature.

This is a riveting, subtle film that, with a few well planned,  shocking moments, and an effectively creepy musical score that  builds suspense to a crescendo, manages to thoroughly engage the viewer. If one is looking for a blood and gore fest, there is really none of that here. Instead, look to be scared out of the seat of your pants by a superb script, wonderful acting, deft direction, and a musical score that will long linger in one's memory. It is little wonder that Jerry Goldsmith, the composer of the original score for The Omen, won an Academy Award for his efforts.

The DVD is a loaded DVD with a lot of interesting features. It provides a forty six minute documetary on the making of the film, which is quite interesting., as well as a director's commentary. There is a also an intriguing, six minute short on some of the pitfalls that beset the cast and crew during the filming of the movie. The composer also has a small segment of his own. There are the other standard features, such as theatrical trailers, interactive menus, and scene selections, as well as crystal clear visuals and audio. This is a first rate DVD of a film well worth having in one's collection. Bravo!",1018051200,62,3693,4.763693270735525
279623,5,6300247104,"The Omen is a ground-breaking, cinematic work of art. Whether one considers this film horror, suspense, or thriller doesn't matter, as it is all of those descriptions and more. The acting talent commissioned for this film is of the highest quality one will ever see in a film of this type. Jerry Golsmith's score is phenomenal and ground-breaking and terrifying. Other than the fact that it was released in 1976, there is nothing dated about this film: The Omen with its superior ingredients in all of film's mediums stands well above any horror/suspense/thrillers that have come out since or before.
I highly recommend the DVD of The Omen over the video. Sure, widescreen is good; but for many films widescreen doesn't make the viewing all that much better. Why I recommend the DVD is for the bounty of extras. The extras are very insightful and informative regarding the casting, the special effects, the controversy surrounding the story, and the music of the film, as well as the tragic and bizarre incidents that occured whilst making it. And while it can be said that ""behind the scenes"" and ""making of"" extras are revealing ""spoilers"" that spoil a film's mystery, the extras on the DVD version of The Omen do nothing short of enlightening without spoiling.
Superb!",1017878400,2,1271,4.916279069767442

Rest assured, Mrs Thorn, that history has proven that you are positively chaste as far as the Oval office is concerned. He is your husband after all....BR>Chuckles and chills galore in this dated 70's hokum about the AntiChrist. Basically a morality tale on the importance of telling the truth to your loved one's, the film makers hokey attempts to psyche out the audience tends to obscure this point. There is much stilted bathos but the business of the photographs is still a masterstroke that gives one the creeps. But why didn't Thorn receive any photographic warnings? The photographer had taken his picture and he was on the prominent hit list as prophesied by the dodgy priest. Instead, the devil goes for the minor bit players and doesn't even bother with Bugenhaggen until the next picture, long after he's given Thorn the daggers that cause his son to come within an inch of unfulfilling his destiny of world domination. Thanks a lot, dad. Also, if you commit a murder it is best not to leave the evidence lying around in marked and easy to open graves. This is what happens when you subcontract. Luckily for the world, the devil continues his bungling throughout the series.
There are some sweet doggy woof-woofs in this film. Rotweillers have had a lot of bad press because of this film which has never really abated although I can relate a story I read once where a Rotweiller rescued a drowning boy. Mind you, he was probably the AntiChrist. You will also thrill to Gregory Peck hanging off some railings while being assaulted by glove puppets. Top entertainment in any age!

The story entails a young boy who is discovered to be the Anti-Christ because of a variety of signs and hints that expose him.  Those who suspect this meet unexpected, surprising and dramatic fates to prevent anyone from discovering his identity.  The story and suspense increase dramatically as the movie progresses.
The acting (including, especially Gregory Peck) is superb and the plot is excellent. The ending is extremely dramatic.  Overall, a great movie which I thought was far better than ""The Exorist"" -a similar movie which preceded and probably influenced The Omen.",1011139200,,748,5.016129032258065
279697,5,6300247104,"When I first saw this movie on DVD, it knew it would become a cult classic.  While possesing shocking scenes and blood 'n gore, this film also has a highly interesting story.  The plot conerns the American ambassador to Britain (Gregory Peck) and his wife (Lee Remick), who unwittingly adopt Damien, the Antichrist.  Peck is just fine as the ambassador who ignores a minister's warnings about his son.  The most horrifying scene I think is when Damien's governess hangs herself at the child's birthday party.  That scene had no blood, but it is so unexpected and revolting that it nearly blew my boxers off!
If you're looking for a highly-frightening horror/mystery film, check out ""The Omen"".  Directed by Richard Donner (who did some of the ""Die Hard"" movies), the film is fascinating, shocking, and at times, emotionally draining, particuarly the scene in which the suspicious photographer is killed.

This film is easily the best horror film. Gregory Peck plays the father, who adopted the son Damien in Rome. Damien is the AntiChrist, but Gregory doesn't know it yet. There are many gory parts, such as the part with the tractor (don't want to spoil it). Best part was the climatic ending. It makes me want to see the sequel.

279702,5,6300247104,"For every ""The English Patient"" or ""Reds"" - ""prestige"" movies that are respectfully reviewed, win some Oscars, and then are more or less forgotten - there is a ""Die Hard"" or ""The Omen"" - unabashedly commercial works that maniuplate the elements of genre so masterfully that they become genuine classics, remaining ever fresh and popular.
All of which is a ""prestige"" way of saying that a quarter of a century after its creation, even after you've seen it several times and know everything that's going to happen, ""The Omen"" is still scary enough to make you mess your drawers. The celebrated deaths (directed with nasty efficiency by director Richard Donner, who later paid homage to the ambulance dive in his ""Lethal Weapon""), the shrieking medieval chants (by composer Jerry Goldsmith, much of whose string work here seems to have gone unaltered into his score for ""Alien"" three years later), and the Mick Jagger-with-babyfat face of Harvey Stephens (whose final appearance in the film is one of the seminal horror images of all time) have nothing subtle about them but they sure work.
Interestingly, the only good acting performance in the whole shebang is that of Billie Whitelaw as the literal nanny-from-Hell. (Trivia note: she was one of Samuel Beckett's favorite interpreters of his work and premiered several of his female roles.) She dives headfirst into the Velveeta of David Seltzer's script and delivers lines like ""Have no fear, little one. I am here to protect Thee"" with unsettling conviction. (Bonus trivia note: Seltzer, who had aspirations of being a serious novelist, said of his smash hit, ""Selling out was easier than I thought it would be."") Gregory Peck, surely one of the most constipated leading men in cinema history, reacts to the murder of his wife as if he has misplaced his Geritol and David Warner, who perhaps foresaw his future doing voice-overs for computer games, puts as little as humanly possible into his work here.",1004486400,,1954,4.9969325153374236
279703,5,6300247104,"The first time i saw this movie, I was scared out of my wits. To begin with, the music by Jerry Goldsmith is extremly effective in creating a demonic presence. Gregory Peck is wonderful as the ambassador as is the priest, Oh yes, the priest played by Tom Duggan. This man was so convincing with those dark piercing eyes and his warnings to the ambassador about Damien that it made him one of my favorite charactors in the movie. The part where he locked himself in the room with the ambassador and told him  "" You must take communion. Drink the blood the blood of crist and eat his flesh"" and the part of him in Bishops Park was to die for. The Baboon scene. The church scene where you see Damien scared to death. The tension mounts as he approaches the church with his parents. You see the fear in poor Damiens face. The climax occurs when the the statue of christ on top of the church points down at Damien and the Chorus yelling at him sounded like the very voice of god. This sent Damien into a rampage ....

It is a decision he will live to regret, because Damien may not be human at all.  He may be the dreaded Anti-Christ, come to rule, then destroy, the world.
The Omen overcomes a sloppy script (in many ways the script for Damien: Omen 2 was better) by using a fine cast, excellent photography, a classic chiller of a score by Jerry Goldsmith, and Richard Donner's expert manipulations of the unfolding events.  The movie works also because it can be read either as a supernatural thriller or as the tale of a man driven to insanity by guilt and circumstance.

But if you want to see this story done really really well, check out THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur.

Relying more on suspense than shock value, the murders are sparsely placed within the films, which make them so much more effective than the average slasher horror film. Everyone is probably familiar with the basic antichrist child plot so I won't summarize.
The Special Edition DVD of the first film includes a worthwhile documentary that explains how some of the effects were created and I especially enjoyed the irony of director Richard Donner refusing to allow the goldfish to be injured while directing such a malevolent film. But, the best part of the Omen DVD is -- watching the famed 'decapitation' in slow motion so you can see how cheesy the dummy looks in 1/8 speed.

Sure you must suspend disbelief for most thrillers of this sort, but that doesn't mean that the characters should speak as unrealistically as they do in this film given the situation.  The giggle-inducing dialogue and over the top Hollywood musical score demolish almost all of the eerie subtlety that should have dominated the film.  On the other hand, several sequences do succeed in causing chills 'n' thrills.  The well staged, gruesome deaths of all involved are certainly creepy in their own dated way and many of the director's and cinematographer's shot choices are right on the money.  The concluding half hour is the film's strongest leg, when father Gregory Peck FINALLY decides to kill off the little bastard along with his satanic nanny.  I found THE OMEN to be quite an amusing film despite its many faults.  I have always been a horror film fan and a huge fan of the ones that infuse satanic mythology into their plotlines.

Robert accepts the idea as he is informed that there isn't any relatives and the records can be doctored.  The priest reassures the heartbroken father that this child is a gift from God.

American ambassador Gregory Peck and his wife Lee Remick have a child that dies shortly after birth in an Italian hospital.  While Remick is unconscious, Peck agrees to adopt another baby in the hospital and pass the child off as their own.  Peck gradually comes to the shocking realization that this child is the antichrist.
""The Omen"" has many positive points.  The film has often been compared with William Friedkin's ""The Exorcist,"" another religious-oriented horror classic that preceded ""The Omen"" by three years.  ""The Omen"" is arguably more suspenseful than ""The Exorcist.""  The key players are perfect: Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, and Billie Whitelaw.  Warner has the most creative death scene in all of film history.
Unfortunately, ""The Omen""'s weaknesses almost outweigh its strengths.  Richard Donner's film actually falls far short of ""The Exorcist.""  In Friedkin's film, we deeply cared about the characters; I cried at the death of the Father Merrin character.  Viewers don't develop the same degree of concern for the characters in ""The Omen.""  In addition, some of the death scenes and intense moments in Donner's film are unintentionally ludicrous and border on being camp.

Gregory Peck plays the US Ambassador who's wife gave birth to a stillborn.  Not wanting to break the news to his wife, the hospital offers him the baby of a woman who died after giving birth, a woman who has no living relatives.

You really feel the Thorns being torn apart by the events that occur, yet still reluctant to believe their son, the child they have been waiting for all their lives, to be the antichrist.  Gregory Peck is very good, and gives the film a sense of respectability, and not just a 70's devil film.  The talented Lee Remick contributes to the story well, making us especially sympathetic for this unfortunate character.  Remick and the whole casts expressions of horrors leave an imprint in your mind for a long time.  David Warner plays the curious photographer. The devil is one of the most horrifying evils of the horror film, and this film really takes this subject seriously, thus making the film a more believable movie.  Also, this classic movie is completely entertaining.  It has some gore for the gore lovers, but also uses it very carefully for those who don't enjoy bloodfests.  It is creepy, eerie, and even a bit campy for those who like that sort of thing.

Peck is all eyebrows and sonorous voice.  The best performance is David Warner's as the photographer.  Despite the fact that it won an Oscar, Jerry Goldsmith's score is both overbearing and distracting, with the ominous Gregorian chanting that always clues the viewer that something Satan-related is about to happen.  Still, it's not a bad way to spend a Saturday night, and there are a few startling moments (not to mention the now-notorious decapitation, which still looks unsettlingly real).  Beats ""End of Days"" cold!",986601600,2,1766,5.055172413793104

279792,4,6300247104,"""The Omen"" is one of the scariest movies I've seen by far. A few days after I saw this movie, I couldn't get the music or the ending out of my head. I won't spoil the ending for those who hadn't seen it, but I will tell you that it is an ending you won't forget. The movie stars Gregory Peck and Lee Remick as a couple living in London, England who adopt a 6-year-old boy who is thought to be the son of Satan. He kills a lot of people by using his powers or his evil smile. He has a number called 666, which is the mark of the Anti-Christ. His parents are unaware at first that he {Damien} is evil, but Robert Thorne {Peck} soon sees and hears many deaths to come and then realizes Damien's true identity. Gregory Peck is always a fine actor, and here he gives one of his most thought-provoking and real performances. His character, Robert Thorne, loves his wife, Kathy {Lee Remick} so much and is worried about her. He has many tender moments with her, and also some moments of terror. There are many moments in this movie that I will never forget. The music is the thing that scares me the most. Jerry Goldsmith won a richly deserved Oscar for his score in 1976. Try to find some time to watch a serious horror movie like this one. I garrantee it will stay with you for a while.",973555200,5,1281,4.169354838709677
279793,4,6300247104,"What do Jaws, Star Wars, and The Omen have in common? It's easy. I dare you, DARE you, not to hum a little music when you start thinking about your favorite scenes in these movies. It's almost impossible isn't it? The musical scores for these three movies are so fresh and effective that they are inseparable from the action on the screen.
Jerry Goldsmith won a much-deserved Oscar for his original score on The Omen. It was the only win out of 17 nominations. One of the best segments on the DVD version is Goldsmith's commentary on certain scenes and how the music affected each one. I found it very educational and (if you'll pardon the pun) a revelation.
The music is addictive, but think twice before mouthing the words to the title theme: the choir is chanting a High Black Mass in Latin. You would basically be walking around the house hailing Satan in front of your family.
Unfortunately, the DVD does not offer a separate musical track, or the option of viewing the movie without music. It would be an interesting experiment, because I feel the score is so good it effectively saves the film from its pedestrian visual style and uninspired acting. Gregory Peck gives the sensational plot much-needed weight, but it seems his face never changes expression throughout the movie. He can even shout without moving his lips.
The British actors are better. David Warner (obsessive fashion-challenged photographer) and Billie Whitelaw (evil nanny channeling Dynasty-era Joan Collins) are the most memorable.
Another aspect of the DVD I enjoyed was Richard Donner's commentary. He spends most of the time trading one-liners with his editor Stuart Baird on the voice-over track. Great fun, and if you've ever wondered how they made Lee Remick appear to fall from a 20-foot balcony, you will find out if you watch the ""making-of"" featurette. Once you see how they did it, you'll have a real ""duh"" moment. I warn you: knowing the trick ruined the scene for me.
The Omen DVD edition is slick, well-packaged and rather silly; much like The Omen itself. Put it on the shelf next to your collection of 'Left Behind' books, and keep the nite-lite handy.",970531200,,2146,4.818428184281843
279794,4,6300247104,"By late 1970's, the worldwide film-watching public had already been brutally exposed to an utterly inconceivable cinematic vision of evil in  William Friedkin's unforgettable horror classic The Exorcist (1973). With  world society forever changed by its outrageously revolting cinematic  visuals, morally offensive religious implications about modern  civilization, and very profitable box office success, it seemed very  unlikely that any film in the future would be able to substantially pull  that public chord again. Subsequently, Hollywood filmmakers impressed with  the rising commercial viability of the horror film (enhanced by the success  of Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Stephen Spielberg's  Jaws (1975)) realized definite financial opportunities in the horror genre.  Unfortunately, this realization leads to a new depressing trend of  uninventive horror films that plagued commercial horror through the late  70's and into the Reagan years.
In spite of this, one modestly-budgeted  suspense thriller/gothic horror film (made for around a scant $2,125,000  dollars) directed by then relative newcomer Richard Donner (Superman: The  Movie, The Lethal Weapon series, Conspiracy Theory), released by 20th  Century Fox, and starring Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, and David Warner began  receiving marvelous critical raves and gained almost an instant place among  horror's finest films.
Though slightly tainted by dated acting and a  time-specific screenplay, the Omen (1976) remains a magnificent ensemble  piece luminously filled with superb performances by a seasoned cast,  unforgettably haunted by an eloquently shocking Academy Award winning music  score by Jerry Goldsmith (Alien, Planet of the Apes), helmed conservatively  but extremely effectively by young Richard Donner, augmented with a  fantastic philosophical atmosphere that provokes the mind as well as the  jugular, and astonishingly peppered by Harvey Stephens's mesmerizing  portray of Damien. The Omen remains a 1970's hallmark to the cinema's  unequalled ability to make distinct characters and places that haunt the  mind's eye forever. Followed by three unremarkable sequels that have  recently been packaged with the original into an Omen DVD Box Set.
As  for the Omen's DVD edition, it contains a Richard Donner commentary track,  a 44-minute Omen Making-Of documentary, theatrical trailers, Jerry  Goldsmith interviews about his score, and much more. A definite must-buy  for any serious horror fan.

Though it doesn't move fast enough and doesn't  have enough CGI to really satisfy many in this day and age, it's still a  good horror movie and well deserving of being labeled an all time  great.

279824,5,6300247104,"I first saw ""The Omen"" at the age of 16. The first of a trilogy,  I found the idea of religious prophecy in a modern context an interesting  twist.
Gregory Peck plays Robert Thorn, an American ambassador. His wife  Kathy (Lee Remick) is unaware that the child she gave birth to had died and  was replaced by another baby. A foundling.  Robert was persuaded by an  Italian priest to ""adopt"" the child, agreeing that Kathy didn't  need to know the truth. Robert and Kathy named the child Damien.
Robert's life becomes a nightmare as Damien grows. Another priest  arrives, telling Robert that the boy mustn't be allowed to live. It takes a  number of  murders before Robert is fully convinced of Damien's true  heritage.
""The Omen"" is an unsettling film. The evil Damien  looks so normal, it is hard for Robert to imagine he is really the son of  the devil. The way certain characters die are unusual, but not really that  gory. (They don't need to be.)
There is also a novel of ""The  Omen"" by David Seltzer. I'm not sure if the film is based on the book  or the book based on the film. The book develops the story and characters  much further and makes Damien even more sinister.
The two sequels that  follow ""The Omen"" are also worth seeing, but I advise you to  ignore ""Omen 4"" completely.",959904000,5,1289,4.478448275862069

If you're patient, the story will pay off in enhanced entertainment values.  Also, at this time, the DVD is a bargain!",1506643200,,425,5.130434782608695
7807431,4,6300247104,"The Omen franchise, which includes three movies (Omen, Damein, and The Final Conflict) is part horror, part mystery/thriller, and has religion as an underlying theme. Out of the three movies, this first one is by far the best of the lot. The only reason I continued watching the other two movies was to get some resolution and closure.

So while I do recommend this movie, unless you really cannot do without the closure, I would suggest stopping at this one.
