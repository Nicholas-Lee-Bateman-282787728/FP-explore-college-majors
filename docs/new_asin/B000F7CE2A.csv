2553911,5,B000F7CE2A,"As a future parent, it's important for me to learn the basics of CPR. This DVD made it possible for me to understand and remember the simple steps of saving my child if he or she becomes incapacitated.",1147219200,4,201,4.315789473684211
2553952,5,B000F7CE2A,This DVD is great!  It was easy to understand and the directions were terrific.  The instructor was warm and interesting.  I feel much more confident about performing airway clearing or CPR if it is ever necessary.  I've made all my friends and family watch it because it is so good.  Every family should have this.,1154563200,2,315,4.654545454545454
2553953,5,B000F7CE2A,This is a great resource for parents/siblings/babysitters. Knowing what to do in an emergency makes a huge difference.  It's a great thing to have on hand. Those first several minutes in an emergency are often the most crucial and practicing these skills can make a huge difference.,1154563200,2,282,5.0
2553954,5,B000F7CE2A,As a mother of 3 children under the age of 5 I found this program very good.  I liked the fact that it wasn't too long.  I could go back to any segment that I wanted to and could review it at any time.  Unlike attending a full length CPR class which can take hours and I don't need to know the infant material which would be a waste of my time to sit through.  It was understandable and definetly worth the price.,1153785600,3,413,3.9397590361445785
2553955,2,B000F7CE2A,"It's unfortunately that this is the only DVD on the market that covers such an important topic.  I took an infant CPR and safety class at Mass. General Hospital, but thought my family would benefit from the knowledge, so I ordered this DVD and watched it with them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of this DVD, or rather the lack thereof.  So were my family.  The program is extremely short.  The chapter on CPR was something like 1 minute long, and the next chapter on infant choking was no longer than five minutes, probably much less.  The treatment of such important topics was cursory at best.  It was obvious to me that the DVD was made with one express purpose: to make money off anxious parents.

Like I said in the beginning, knowing infant CPR is *very* important, because even though infants very rarely stop breathing on their own, they do face a high risk of choking when they are 5-6 months or older, so knowing what to do in a bad situation (before 911 help arrives) is of paramount importance.  But this DVD is too poorly produced.  You should watch it at least 5 times to understand exactly what to do.  The material is there, it's just very poorly presented.

BTW, as with many baby care DVDs, this is available on Netflix as well as at many local public libraries that stock educational DVDs.  Good luck!",1153526400,7,1331,4.518828451882845
2553956,5,B000F7CE2A,The new guidelines are included in the DVD and the only change to the old guidelines is the ratio 30:2.  The narrator does cover the changes in the DVD and stresses that BOTH guidelines have the potential to save a life which is true.  People watching this DVD need to know the basics of CPR and what to do and how to react in an emergency.  The numbers are important but not the most important part.  What is important is giving people the skills to be confident enough to act in an emergency and possibly save a life.,1152748800,4,519,4.26530612244898
2553957,2,B000F7CE2A,"Excellent information except for one thing, it does not follow American Heart Association 2006 guidelines for breath and compression ratio.  Supposed to be 2 breaths to 30 compressions.  This video teaches 1 breath to 5 compressions.",1152748800,4,233,5.444444444444445
2553958,5,B000F7CE2A,"As the parent of a toddler, I can attest to the fact that you can never be too safe or too well-informed.  This DVD is a MUST SEE for not only parents, but also grandparents, babysitters, aunts, uncles - pretty much everyone since there will come a time in most people's lives when they will need to watch after a young child.  I feel better prepared now that I've viewed this video.",1150588800,4,383,4.305555555555555
2553959,5,B000F7CE2A,"After several close calls and a couple of tragic events in my area, I decided it was prudent to know the skills covered on this DVD.  While I have no kids of my own, I am frequently in the company of my nieces and nephews.  I couldn't live with myself if something happened to one of them and I did not know what to do.  I took a CPR course at a local hospital, but felt it would be good to keep my skills fresh, just in case!  This DVD is just the ticket.  The instructor is clear and precise in her explanations, and she even covers the newest guidelines soon to be released by the major CPR instruction agencies.  As an extra bonus, there is excellent material covering infant and child safety measures you should take around your house to prevent sudden and unexpected  tragedies.  It's all supported by a board certified pediatrician, so you know you are getting great information.  If you have kids, or have loved ones with kids, buy a copy for yourself, and everyone you know!",1147219200,5,983,4.386740331491713
8118534,5,B000F7CE2A,The book is excellent!  I am a first time grandmother and have to re-learn the month by month development of an infant.,1437955200,,119,4.409090909090909
8118535,4,B000F7CE2A,Ok video. Reminded me of an 80s video I would watch in grade school. Pretty clear and repetitious (which is great).,1393372800,,115,4.523809523809524
8118536,1,B000F7CE2A,It is an old version. This is not and updated version. I had to ask for a refund.,1243814400,,81,3.5555555555555554
8118537,3,B000F7CE2A,"Okay, I am a stay at home mom who does not have time for a CPR class but would like to learn how.  So you think a DVD like this would be perfect.  First off it is a bit confusing and lengthy.  They don't do a good job of teaching you in a way that you can remember.  I actually think I have already forgot everything I learned from watching it.  ALSO, I am not sure how current this type of CPR I learned is.  I would recommend researching it a bit further than I did.",1237593600,,468,3.8229166666666665
8118538,4,B000F7CE2A,"This dvd is a good review for the medical provider and a good overview for the layperson. I suggest every family with infants/children watch a DVD or tape like this yearly or take a class. I do know the guidelines may have changed a little bit since the DVD was made, so what I did was print out easy to follow CPR and choking directions and hung them in an easy to reach place in the kitchen for everyone - but I did make my whole family watch this and will keep it around for the future.",1201219200,,489,4.051546391752577
8118539,4,B000F7CE2A,"While I wouldn't advocate relying on a DVD to replace Red Cross CPR training, it was a perfect refresher for me (trained <5 years ago) and enough to make me feel more comfortable with babysitters after they viewed it. It gives all the necessary steps in a clear (if not a little cheesy) way and is concise enough not to bore you to tears.",1182902400,2,338,4.296875
8118540,1,B000F7CE2A,This video has outdated information on the correct ratio for CPR.  Needs to be updated!,1175126400,,87,4.8
8118541,1,B000F7CE2A,take a class; I did after watching this video  and learned much more hands on. I think any video alone won't work at all,1163030400,,120,4.0
8118542,5,B000F7CE2A,"I thought this video was good.  It gets to the point and lets you stop and rewatch things.  I don't need lenghty explanations on how and why, I just want to know how to save a life if I need to.  I am buying this for myself and my children's grandparents because I think the video is to the point enough to keep the grandparents interested in watching it all.  Not too long and boring.",1158364800,3,385,4.093333333333334
