But the mystery of why Chan Hung hides just out of earshot remains. The movie has aged, but still tantalizes.",1171238400,3,283,4.3584905660377355
2438592,1,B000BRBAAQ,"low grade mess of a flick.

when I first saw it many years ago (upon release) I thought it was far better than it actually is.

I regret wasting my money on the DVD. live and learn.

just because something is shot on 16mm B & W for little $$$ does not make it (automatically)

worthwhile.",1168732800,,288,4.089285714285714
8091374,5,B000BRBAAQ,"Cool time capsule of early 80s San Francisco and its Chinese community. The acting is impressive, often it doesn't seem scripted at all and you can almost think you're watching a documentary about real people. The leisurely pacing and extended street scenes also add to the cinma-vrit feel. A fun watch.",1517356800,,303,4.96078431372549

8091377,5,B000BRBAAQ,"This is a very clever movie with convincing acting.  I showed this movie to my kids (9/10) as part of an extensive study of San Francisco.  Although it's not easy for kids to understand what the writer and director was trying to do, there is some atmosphere in here that was very genuine.  For kids to get the theme will probably take some discussion.  The theme itself, the point of the movie seems a bit dated, but then again it was 1983.  I did not see this movie at that time, but I imagine it was more avant-garde at the time.  25 years later, when I left the bay area, it was much less segregated than the movie suggests, and other foreign cultures, Mexican, Indian, and Vietnamese in particular, were eclipsing any bipolarity portrayed in the movie, and the assimilated population is probably far greater now than that of immigrants or those in ethnic enclaves, or even the ""white"" people for that matter.  Gentrification is the issue in San Francisco for at least a generation now.  It doesn't matter anymore if it's the Mission, Filmore, or Chinatown, or if you're brown, black or yellow.  You just have to be a millionaire.

Fortunately, this movie is not just about the Chinese ethnicity of the characters.  In fact, stereotypes, presuppositions, and assumptions are just some of the things that are keeping the protagonists from finding Chan, or coming to realize they don't know Chan, and this is something that is univerally human about the movie's theme.",1480464000,,1469,4.744094488188976

8091379,5,B000BRBAAQ,"Here's a wonderful little film, made for next to nothing, that is far more than the confining labels of ""quirky"" & ""whimsical"" that have been attached to it. Yes, it is those things -- but it's also a lot more, as it delves into the Chinese-American experience, deflating & dismissing easy stereotypes for a more complex & subtle portrait. I like that it uses the narrative structure of a mystery, right down to the deliberately ominous & self-aware ""mystery"" music at one point. But this is really one of those stories where it's the journey that matters, rather than the destination. As our bemused protagonist observes in voiceover, ""This mystery is appropriately Chinese: what's not there seems to have just as much meaning as what is there."" That's something those reviewers who disliked the film because ""nothing happens"" might consider on a second viewing.

The B&W, 16-millimeter film stock makes art out of necessity, lending the film a documentary air that makes it all the more convincing. The DVD has some fascinating extras, including interviews with the two lead actors some 30 years after the fact; but it's the film itself that makes this worth buying, not just renting. I'll definitely be watching it again -- highly recommended!",1406678400,,1246,4.990384615384615
8091380,5,B000BRBAAQ,"Two guys from San Francisco look for a man that has disappeared with four grand of their money.  This movie is older, however it is a must see for today's Asian-American or non Asian-American who is interested in the culture of the San Francisco area Asian-AMERICAN community!",1364947200,,276,4.872340425531915
8091381,2,B000BRBAAQ,"It concerns two cab drivers, played by Wood Moy and Marc Hayashi, both of whom participated in the 30+ years later retrospective. There's a third character, only referred to, named Chan, a partner in their independent cab company in San Francisco, who has gone missing, owing a rather sizable chunk of change. The movie is about the search for him, though it's really about Chinese people integrating and interacting. (It's an art film, remember!) Nothing is concluded; Chan is never found (though the money is returned by way of his daughter). Wood Moy, the older of the two, is something like 80 years old now and still quite articulate. Marc, the younger one, says at one point that he is now roughly the age the older one was when the film was made.

Several times I almost stopped the film out of sheer boredom. It's a very slow-paced film, shot in black and white, almost documentary in feel. It was done in 1982 as an art film, more or less, on a budget of $20K, though it took in over $2 million when it was released. (That's a pretty good return!) There are some interesting things in it, though I doubt if I'd watch it again.",1279065600,,1135,4.509708737864078

8091383,5,B000BRBAAQ,"Jo and Steve are two friends in Chinatown San Francisco, attempting to get to the bottom of the mysterious disappearance of their colleague Chan Hung.  Initially, they are motivated by a sum of money Chan owes them, so they track down leads that they think might help them determine what happened to Chan.  In an entertaining inversion of the traditional detective mystery, where the hero gets closer to the answer, each lead in Chan Is Missing multiplies the possibility of where the missing man could be, drawing the two farther away from solving the mystery.

The movie is shot in grainy b/w, simultaneously (perhaps intentionally) possessing qualities of a documentary, art house, and film noir.  Wood Moy is the patient elderly ""detective"" and Marc Hayashi is his assimilated sidekick.  It was breathtaking to see an actual Chinese man finally stepping into the shoes of that other ""Chinese American"" detective embedded in the conscience of mystery movie fans.  The missing of that Chan is a welcomed breath of fresh air.

Based on the Chinese movies I have seen so far, this is definitely at the top of the list.  I say this because it possesses what I have always regarded as a Chinese (and Japanese, based on my experiences) quality: to impart a piece of information to you without directly telling you that information.

For example, in a Chinese riddle Jo relays to Steve, a girl is trapped by an evil man who forces her to chose one of two doors.  He tells her that one door leads to his bed chambers, and the other leads to freedom.  Realizing both doors led to his bed chambers, the girl opted for the best choice and pointed to one of the doors, stating, ""that door does not lead to the outside.""

This oblique form of communication draws as much from what is unsaid as what is said.  For me, this film was instructive, reaffirming, and empowering in it's ability to show that each and every Asian person has a multitude of untold stories: it set up one Chinese individual, inviting us- the viewer - to be enlisted in helping solve the mystery.  In doing so, it teases out our presumptions about who this Chinese person Chan was.  One lead after another, I found my presumptions were null and my perception of Chan Hung expanding along with those of the two amateur detectives.

One of the leads tells them ""when looking into the puddle of water, he told me the only person who could fix him was that person in the puddle.""
This holographic clue puts the ball in the mystery solver's court.

Some of the best written mysteries are really a journey of self-discovery.  By the end of the story, we know more about the person trying to solve the case than the reasons behind the crime.

I don't want to give the story away, so I'll just say this: In many interactions between Asians and non-Asians (and sometimes assimilated Asian Americans), you will often see the crime in Chan is Missing re-enacted.  And when you do, you have the ability to find Chan, discover the culprit, and solve the mystery on the spot.

(The dvd version comes with interviews with Wood Moy and Marc Hayashi and several other people involved in production.  From these interviews, one can find a nice window into the creative community among the Asian Americans in the San Francisco area.  Peter Wang, who plays the cynical cook, is a director and writer in real life.  Peter Feng has an insightful analysis about Chan is Missing in his excellent book ""Identities In Motion.""  )",1215043200,5,3465,4.687603305785124
