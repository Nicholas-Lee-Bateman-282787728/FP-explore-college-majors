8056191,4,B0008FXT14,"This is an extremely entertaining dark comedy that will have you in stitches in certain scenes, especially if you understand Mexican culture. The product description, listed here at Amazon is taken directly from the DVD and was enough to capture my interest before I watched this film. However , once I started watching it I felt that the description does not really do the film justice; it is that and much, much, more. A father and son are reunited after the son gets involved in a robbery gone bad(the victim has a stroke during the robbery)and leaves Spain to see his father in Mexico. He not only finds his dad but his whole crew of misfits who are really an odd bunch of characters. Enter Caiman, an elder leader of the group of bums. Well, they do sell street food but never have money to pay the rent but plenty to drink with. The relationships between the various characters and the women of the neighborhood is part of what fascinates about this movie. The soundtrack is very cool and the black and white imagery is a refreshing change of pace from what are used to seeing in movies. The acting is great, especially Caiman played by the late Rafael Velasco who is everyman but no one; he is the invisible ghost that lurks within but sensibility contains. Tia Carmela, the robust matriarch is hilarious. A series of events take place that reveal the nature of human relationships but eventually these misfits resort to crime again. Caiman has hopes of pulling off one big bank heist so he can ""hear the ocean daily."" There is much disagreement but eventually they concede to Caimans wishes and put on ridiculous masks to pull off the bank robbery. Naturally, it is a fiasco but good for some belly laughs. The price is right for this winner if you like Mexican cinema. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles if so desired. The bonus features are limited but the making of is a revealing glimpse into Mexican film making. Check it out, you might like it; at this bargain price you can hardly go wrong. Esta bien chido y te va gustar,(it is very cool and you will like it).",1199836800,4,2087,4.553191489361702
