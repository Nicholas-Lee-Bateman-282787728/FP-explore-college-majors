2415745,1,B000BFH2I2,"This item is packaged so as to mislead the purchaser.  The cover indicates  that the features are Sherlock Holmes movies.  Since I am a collector of Sherlock Holmes Movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, I leapt at the opportunity to get titles that I did not have.  When I got the DVD, I found to my surprise that of the 4 movies on the DVD, only 1 was Sherlock homes and I already had that one in my collection.  I was hoping that I was going to receive 3 new movies so I dismissed that I already had one of the movies, which, by the way, was the only Sherlock Holmes feature on the disc.",1279584000,17,599,4.129310344827586
