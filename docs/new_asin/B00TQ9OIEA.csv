8702730,5,B00TQ9OIEA,"After an entire year of studying the Psalms via books, devotionals, documentaries, movies, and every way I could find - this book was by far my favorite. Somehow the author was able to give a chapter I'd known by heart for over 35 years amazing new depth and clarity. I have already read it three times, and loaned it out twice, it is that good!",1515024000,,345,4.323076923076923

8702735,5,B00TQ9OIEA,"This was the best DVD I have shown our children at church! They were spellbound for the entire movie! The age group was kindergarten through fifth grade. We were able to understand the 23rd Psalm so much better. I can't say enough good things about this DVD. Then I loaned it to a couple in their late 70's and they just raved on it. My husband and I watched it first, (age 56 and 59) and we were amazed. I would love to have more of these as teaching tools! I have 29 years experience as an educator and I think everyone should see this.
