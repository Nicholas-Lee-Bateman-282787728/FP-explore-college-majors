8326232,5,B0019CUJXQ,"What a wonderful story - real people, fabulous music, raw singing and spectacular dancing - this is a documentary of a road journey with some of the world's top international gypsy performers - and in true Romani style, you get to feel part of their family, to laugh with them and cry with them, as they recount some of their life's experiences along the way.

I teach American Tribal Style bellydance and for me this dvd is such a joy to watch as the roots of our dance are steeped in the history of the Romani peoples from around the world.  You'll experience their song and dance from Indian, Spain, Macedonia, Romania ...

I viewed this dvd from our local library and just needed to have a copy for myself.  Amazon was speedy in their delivery, excellent service.",1254009600,,767,4.536231884057971
