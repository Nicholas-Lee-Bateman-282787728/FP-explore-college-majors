8549870,5,B00ABNCNG0,"This review is for the Berliner Philharmoniker videos of the Beethoven symphonies which are free on amazon.com.  To be frank, I doubted that an Italian conductor could perform Beethoven's symphonies with effect.  In my youth, Arturo Toscanini's recordings of Beethoven on RCA were heralded as perfection.  Wait a minute . . .  Otto Klemperer's recordings made Toscanini's sound shallow, mechanical and devoid of feeling.  I avoided Beethoven played by Italians for years, not that there were many recordings of note of this ilk.  But generalizations can be dangerous.  Abbado most definitely ""gets"" Beethoven and the Berlin Philharmonic is the perfect vehicle for a conductor that understands and enjoys Beethoven.  Highly recommended musically and the videography is excellent.  Kudos to amazon for making this available at no charge to Prime members.",1518566400,,852,5.492307692307692
8549871,5,B00ABNCNG0,"I bought these to have a complete Beethoven Symphony DVD set to watch, featuring a modern conductor with informed, up-to-date ideas about how to conduct them. At the Amazon marketplace price, the set can be obtained pretty cheaply, and I found them quite satisfying.

I have Gielen conducting several of the Mahler symphonies, and quite enjoy the ideas he brings to the table in those. Likewise, his Beethoven is (as the other reviewers noted) brisk and lean with interesting--but not radical--things to say. Modern instrument renditions, but clearly informed by HIP practices as they existed in the 1990s. As of 2017, this probably makes Gielen's approach more middle-of-the-road, and not cutting or even bleeding edge. I have a lot of Beethoven symphony sets on CD, and--at least from the standpoint of interpretations--I wouldn't say this is the be-all- and-end-all.

Its quite good as  comprehensive set, however. What really stands out are the visuals: very precise and clear camera work that highlights extremely well what's going on in the music. Gielen himself is not much to watch dramatically; he's no Bernstein! But that matters less when the other camera angles are so good. Some of the symphonies were recorded live, others appear not to be. The sound is uniformly great

Beethoven symphony cycles follow me home like lost puppies. Among the recent acquisitions over the past several years that get the most airplay because of their interpretations: Riccardo Chailly & Leipzig (for all except the 9th); David Zinman & Zurich Tonhalle (all 9, plus the violin and piano concerti); John Elliott Gardiner and the ORR; Hermann Scherchen's set with the Vienna State Opera from the '50s--way ahead of his time on matters of tempi and dynamics; and for traditional readings I go back to various Karajan sets (I marginally prefer the 1977 set over the '62 set, but I have both, as well as the Philharmonia set from the '50s, which is great.). If I want to get into the ""way-back machine"", there's nothing finer than Felix Weingartner from the late '20s and early 30s, conducting the London or Vienna Philharmonics There is very little that the historically-informed practices group could teach Weingartner; his Beethoven is the very model of crispness, at a time when readings were starting to get pretty ponderous.  Lastly, Bruno Walter's NY Philharmonic recordings from the late '40s and early '50s are the perfect antidote to anyone whose lasting impression of Walter rests solely on his autumnal recordings with the Columbia Symphony of a decade later.",1483315200,,2560,5.100238663484487
8549872,4,B00ABNCNG0,"I agreed the other comment stating that the fist movement of 6th was too fast. It is true particularly compared to the Karajan's.
It looks obvious even the players appear rushed. But I guess it is the fun of the music watching that they do differently. If they are all same as Karajan's, why would you buy another set of music like this in addition to the Karajan's? It is always fun and entertaining to see different style of music by different conductors. LoL. Cheers",1417478400,,469,4.529411764705882
8549873,4,B00ABNCNG0,"These performances of the complete Beethoven Symphonies were recorded live at the Konzerthaus Freiburg between December 1997 and February 2000. They have previously surfaced as a 5 CDset  on the Hanssler Classics label. Gielen also has another recorded cycle of these works on EMI (1998) which are now out-of-print and, even in the second-hand market are extremely difficult to obtain as a  set.

As a complete cycle of the Beethoven Symphonies I found this set very enjoyable. The symphonies are performed on modern instruments and, generally speaking, tempi are brisk, more akin to the performances one finds on period instrument collections. However, in the main, I did find them compelling. There is energy and yet a warmth in Gielens conducting. Textures are transparent and he elicits great precision from the orchestra. This, to me, is no-nonsense Beethoven. It is a very lean approach to the symphonies. I do not think, however, that he penetrates the depths of these symphonies to the same extent as, for instance, Furtwangler does, but Gielen  does share many insights into these works with the listener.

Having watched and listened to all the symphonies here, I would single out symphonies 4 and 7 as being the best and most effective performances. Symphonies 2 and 5 have opening movements which are very brisk, perhaps too much so for some, but I did think the performances worked. The problematic symphony for me was no. 6. The opening movement is too fast and as a whole the symphony sounded superficial. In fact, I would go as far to say that it sounded rushed and frantic.

Gielen is one of the least flamboyant conductors I have ever seen grace the podium. His conducting manner is very restrained and sober.  He conducts from a score and is very undemonstrative. Camera work is very good and well-judged, and adds to the enjoyment of the works. Apart from one or two reservations regarding tempi and the less than successful performance of the 6th symphony, this set can be recommended.",1362873600,7,2006,4.9523809523809526
