7967820,3,B00006FD93,"This is one of those films that you feel guilty about because it's bad by all standards but you can't help but enjoy it. I decided to watch this years ago because I am a big fan of William Baldwin though his latest movie choices have been less than impressive.

What's the film about in a nutshell? Not much.

We have the standard Fatal Attraction storyline here and it's just as bland and pitiful as it could get. Bored housewife Grace (Natasha Kinski) is a struggling, over-the-hill model in a failing marriage to out-of-work executive, Matt (the very handsome Hart Bochner). They have a little girl and that seems to be the only thing they have in common. Neither Grace nor Matt convinced me that they had ever been in love. Maybe it was the writing but I had to remind myself they were even married.

Desperate to spice up her marriage anyway possible, Grace takes her friend's invitation to go to Miami Beach for a vacation with Matt. Problem is that Matt (a boozer of course)doesn't wanna go. Tired of Matt's whining and sulking, Grace goes off by herself of course and meets the suave Julian Banks (William Baldwin).

Julian seduces Grace rather slowly and she has sex with him. She explains it meant nothing and that she loves her husband. Somehow we get the feeling Julian won't take no for an answer. Fast forward, once Grace gets back from Miami Beach, Matt has gotten a new job with this mysterious company and life is grand for the couple once again.

The film couldn't be complete without the pitiful so-called twists. Turns out that Matt's new boss is none other than Julian and he has more power and money than Donald Trump. Please. He can make dreams come true and crush your world at the same time. Julian begins to manipulate Grace and her marriage by holding Matt's job over her head. Grace claims she is so upset with Matt being used but manages to hold her tongue about the affair. Of course she did or there wouldn't be a story. Little by little Julian manipulates and even flirts with Grace right in front of Matt. She finally decides to tell him when things go too far. In one of those horribly lame twists (and there are many) we learn that Julian not only set up Matt to give him a job, but also has been stalking Grace for a while. Even the Miami Beach vacation was a setup for him to get close to Grace. By the time this comes to a head, Grace and Matt's marriage is in shambles, they separate and Matt swears he's gonna get custody of their daughter. All the while Julian is on the sidelines pulling the couple's puppet strings and neither are smart enough to do anything about it.

The big problem is not the plot or the acting. It's the writing and the characters. The characters were TSTL (too stupid to live). Even Julian was stupid. These characters have no sense whatsoever and the movie is written in a manner to conveniently keep this elementary plot going. The characters' reactions are never what they should be. It is completely unbelievable that instead of Grace telling Matt about Julian, she allows him to run their lives for months just to keep their affair a secret? Please. Let's not mention Matt. Matt rants and raves once he finds out about the affair yet CONTINUES to work with Julian! That's right. He keeps on with the job just because Julian tells him he believes in him. WTF? What man is gonna continue working with someone who has had an affair with his wife under any circumstances? Top that off with the fact that after Grace realizes how twisted Julian is and after he's ruined her marriage AND after she knew he was stalking her, she relies on him and trusts him to help her with a lawyer, not thinking that he might be setting her up again? There is no excuse for characters to be so idiotic just for plot's sake! It's pathetic! What the hell was wrong with the script advisers of this movie? How could someone approve the plot holes in this movie unless they think the public is stupid.

By the end you're lucky you got through the movie. You'll love this movie if you don't expect things to make sense. If you do then you won't last five minutes. Instead of going from A to B to C, these people go from A to F to P to D. Nothing happens as it should. Nothing is realistic and it becomes less of a thriller and more of a comedy as the film goes on. What was very sad and unbelievable was that Matt can still be on friendly terms with Julian after learning about the affair yet treats Grace like dog poop. He even plays into Julian's hands and begins to think Grace would harm their daughter! What? You mean this man has been married to this woman all this time and a perfect stranger is gonna make him turn on his wife? You see why I say,""ridiculous""? This is the type of pitiful crap you are gonna get watching this movie. Nothing makes sense at all!

This is the type of film you watch because you like the actors in it. Period. This is not a good movie at all. If William Baldwin hadn't been in it, I wouldn't have even checked it out. Bochner was a bonus.

I gave this three stars because of the beautiful set, scenery and costume design. Something about the film is like a breath of fresh air. It is a very nice-looking film with an attractive cast. I admit it keeps you watching so it obviously holds you but you soon realize it holds you for the wrong reasons. You keep watching because you can't believe how asinine the film continues to get.

If you actually end up enjoying the story and the writing then you are just easy to please or you need to watch more movies because obviously you don't know what's good writing and what's not. If you're not a Baldwin, Bochner or Kiniski fan don't waste your time. You will be disappointed at every end.",1309910400,2,5715,4.403409090909091

7967822,3,B00006FD93,"Well like I said in the title, she is the one. Still pretty, I remember the poster, the little girl in the seventies. But other than the sexy body. I saw a matured actress also in this movie. I don't know how many people noticed her acting ability in her performance in this movie. I don't how many directors even consider her for a movie for her acting capacity. She is extemely talented and I hope soon some one will exploit that talent than her body beauty.

 William Baldwin, he did a remarkable job for what was given to him. I don't even know the actor who acted as Nastassja Kinski's husband and I don't think anyone will ever remember that actor for what he did with the role given to him. He was pathetic.

 Overall, bad script and directing messed this movie up. One feels like the director did not had much idea of what to show after showing Nastassja Kinski naked for couple of shots. May be that was what he intended with the whole movie. In that area too he didn't do a good job.",1124496000,6,993,4.26595744680851
7967823,3,B00006FD93,"The ever lovely Nastassja Kinski is the foundation for this derivative thriller, short on thrills, long on windy conversations.  But Kinski puts her all into it, and makes this ""Fatal Attraction"" in reverse entertaining.  William Baldwin, looking more like Alec every day, plays a powerful executive who tricks Kinski into a one night stand while she is off an a vacation.  Her husband (played by the sturdy Hart Bochner) is going through a funk due to the loss of his job and he has started drinking.  When Kinski returns home, she finds out that Baldwin was a little more than just a one night stand.  The movie meanders on with Kinski having various things happen to her due to Baldwin's influence, and the ending culminates in a showdown.  Baldwin's fate however is disappointing considering what he did.

Reminiscent of late night cable movies, SAY NOTHING offers nothing new, but Kinski shines again.",1104796800,4,906,4.921052631578948
7967824,3,B00006FD93,"Let me start by saying that, at some point while watching Nastassja Kinski in this movie, I thought of Diane Lane. They're both stunningly beautiful, they both became celebrities at their young age, then they went through all kinds of ups and downs in their careers... Yet one appears to be luckier than the other...
....That being said, I honestly didn't expect a lot from this movie when I rented it, much less be fooled by its tagline ""Think Fatal Attraction... in reverse."" I didn't really care if William Baldwin acted well as a sweet stalker, or how Hart Bochner portrayed the character of a betrayed husband... Oh well, I had decided to be lenient with all the flaws of ""Say Nothing"" just to savour Nastassja's beauty (yes, she's still very attractive...and although I thought her ... body was somehow sexier in ""Cold Heart"", I felt compensated to enjoy the scene that featured her own famous poster -- remember, the one in which she posed with a python wrapped around her?. It's so nostalgic to me...) So here comes the bottom line: If you once loved Nastassja or still adore her, go watch her in ""Say Nothing"". The movie might let you down. She will not.",1041984000,16,1163,4.650485436893204
