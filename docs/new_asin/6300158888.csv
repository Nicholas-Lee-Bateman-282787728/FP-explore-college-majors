210216,4,6300158888,"""Vengeance Valley"" (1951) is not just a great title for a western, but a well-made, intelligent feature that should please Burt Lancaster and Robert Walker fans. A cattle baron (Ray Collins) takes in an orphaned boy (Owen Daybright) and raises him. His own son (Lee Strobie) is about the same age. Although Lee resents Owen they generally get along and share a lot of coming of age adventures on the ranch. But as they mature Lee's (Robert Walker) resentment causes him to become a slacker and the classic prodigal son. After a long absence he returns with a wife, appears to have cleaned up his act, and reconciles with his father.

But Lee's past includes a girl named Lily that he got pregnant. Owen covers for him, but this causes Lee to resent his stepbrother even more. When he suspects that his father's ranch and his new wife are slipping away from him, he sets up Owen to be killed by Lily's two brothers. Although this prodigal son-Cain and Abel stuff is hardly original, the two stars are excellent in their respective parts. Lancaster reins in his excesses and gives a nice controlled performance, with his suppressed energy just visible enough to give Owen a nice dimensionality.

Walker in convincing as a two-faced villain, still motivated by childhood jealousy but able to conceal it from everyone but the audience. Walker is relatively forgotten today, but was the 1940's version of James Dean; although his looks and style are more like a young Robert Vaughn.

When not occupied with its melodramatic story, ""Vengeance Valley"" has the look of an extremely well-produced documentary, going into great detail about the process of a spring roundup and providing a lot of very scenic backgrounds. A ranch hand named Hewie (Carleton Carpenter) provides an informative voice-over. The film features some great cattle scenes, a lot of good riding sequences, and a couple well staged fights. Watch for an early appearance by young Hugh O'Brian-just a few years away from starring in television's ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"".

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1162425600,14,2089,4.892655367231638
210217,2,6300158888,"This is the most difficult kind of a review to write: a movie that had absolutely no impact on the reviewer at all.  The film exists.  I exist.  I experienced the film.  After the film, what did I take away from it?  Nothing.  (I'm forcing myself to write this, because after doing seventeen one dollar DVD reviews, I'm far too anal to simply start skipping titles now.)

VENGEANCE VALLEY (1951) is a movie that I wouldn't expect many people to love, but which I also wouldn't expect many people to hate either.  There's just not a lot of substance to get excited one way or the other.

Ray Collins (Boss Jim Gettys in CITIZEN KANE) is the aging owner of a cattle ranch.  He has two grown sons: one who was adopted as a child (Burt Lancaster) and one biological son (Robert Walker).  The adopted son is this western's good son and the biological is the movie's bad son.

That's basically all you now need to know.  The good son moves through the picture doing good deeds and picking up the pieces left behind by his bad brother who goes around being -- you guessed it -- bad.  That sentence summaries about ninety percent of the movie's scenes.  There's no questionable morality, no ethical ambiguity, no real reason to think much, give any thought to the character's inner lives or even to think of them as real people at all.

As an aside, there would appear to be the glimmers of a good idea buried deep within the backstory.  It's the adopted son who turns out good.  Is there some resentment from their shared childhood that turns the biological son into a twisted, petty, immature adult?  Ray Collins mentions that he adopted Lancaster partly because he needed help raising Walker.  Was it the influence of this boring and disgustingly moral older sibling that turned Walker from the path of nice to the path of naughty?  Was Walker damned from birth?  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't seem very interested in these questions.

What makes the film even more unlikable is that even within the broad strokes of the good guy vs. bad guy characterizations, the individual people aren't even portrayed in an interesting manner.  For instance, given that Robert Walker is an out and out baddie, you'd have hoped that the filmmakers could have made him an interesting villain - a bad guy you could cheer for, or at least sympathize with.  But he isn't a powerful and strong evil guy.  His bad  nature is communicated through him being extraordinarily whiny, sniveling and annoying.  Sure, this makes the audience dislike him, but it doesn't make him fun to watch.

The only character I really enjoyed seeing was played by John Ireland.  He enters the film initially seeking revenge for his sister (she's impregnated and then abandoned) and later becomes the bad son's hit man.  Ireland understands how to create an enjoyable villain.  He scowls, growls and grumbles.  He also has the advantage of getting the script's best lines: ""I'm gonna kill a man before I leave here,"" he barks at the town's sheriff immediately after getting off the inbound train.  (""Anybody special, or will I do?"" retorts the sheriff.)  This is how to portray a villain with no redeeming characteristics at all.  Make him fully bad; don't make him annoying.

(Incidentally, John Ireland is a popular fellow in the Wal*Mart one dollar DVD bin.  Without trying or realizing, I've managed to pick up at least three of his films.  It's a shame the movies themselves all been pretty lousy, but I've been entertained by  Ireland's performances in all three.)

Other than John Ireland, I really can't think of much else to recommend about the film.  (The cattle ranching sequences are done well, if you're really into cows.)  The only thing I believe I'll remember about this movie is that typing up this review taught me how to spell ""vengeance"" properly. (Three e's.  Who knew?)",1135555200,8,3847,4.746223564954683
210218,1,6300158888,"I purchased Front Row Entertainment's VHS version of ""Vengeance Valley"" and was bitterly disappointed. The video quality is poor and the sound track is no better. The story, from what I could make of it, is humdrum. If you're a Lancaster fan, however, the movie is worth having in your collection. And if you're a fan of wasting 20 bucks on a poor quality video, this is a tape for you!",1077494400,4,386,4.450704225352113
210219,3,6300158888,"Vengeance Valley is an average Western. Its best feature is a remarkably strong cast. This alone means that it ought not to be classified as a B film, for second features could not afford so many familiar faces, nor could they afford the fine location shooting which is to be found in Vengeance Valley. The cast perform quite well. Robert Walker always makes a better villain than a good guy. He portrays both weakness and malevolence in a performance which bears comparison with his more celebrated role in Strangers on a Train. It is always a pleasure to watch Burt Lancaster, but his acting lacks the authority which would be present in his later films. I always look out for Joanne Dru films, but this is not one of her best. The feisty and beautiful heroine of She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Red River seems to have faded somewhat and it is possible to see in this film the seeds of her decline as a star. She would make no more important films after this.
The story is interesting without being original. Walker and his foster brother Lancaster fight it out over Dru and Cattle. Strangely the `vengeance' of the film's title does not refer to this aspect of the plot, but to a sub-plot in which two cowboys seek vengeance on the man who made their sister pregnant. Still Vengeance Valley makes a more snappy title than Battling Brothers.
This is by no means a classic Western, but it is perfectly competent. It may not linger long in the memory, but fans of the genre will certainly enjoy the ride while it lasts.",988502400,10,1517,4.52
210220,3,6300158888,"This is a sturdy western featuring beautiful color photography, and an interesting character study.  Burt Lancaster plays a stolid, depedable foster son who reluctantly has to face down his reckless foster brother played by Robert Walker.  Walker and Lancaster play off each other well, their naturally opposing acting styles heightning the conflict between these two.  Unfortunately, Robert Walker, who made quite an impression in his short film career -- especially in  Hitchcock's ""Strangers on a Train"" -- would be dead shortly after this film was released.  A sad footnote to an overlooked but interesting film.",986860800,6,616,5.442105263157894

The dudes all looked the same, only two of the dudes had a dude ranch and a girl named Jen, the other two dudes tried to kill the dudes who hung out with Jen. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because they showed how to break in a horse, in a nice scene, otherwise a lot of (bad) dudes) fighting good dudes and the good dudes killed the bad dudes in the end, as expected.

210258,4,6300158888,"Vengeance Valley & Rage at Dawn

Westerns, or Cowboy Movies, were popular in the 1930s and 1940s (or earlier). They usually told of the conflict between the cattle barons (large corporate ranches) and small ranchers or homesteaders (small farmers). These conflicts were based on historical facts (which are censored from most school books). They became less popular with the rise of the Private Investigator stories in the 1940s and 1950. The search for a missing person is comparable to finding missing cattle. Here are their condensed reviews.

Vengeance Valley 1951
This color movie is about cattle ranching where Herefords are raised for meat. Missing cattle are traced to another ranch. There is a fight, then a plot to profit from a roundup of cattle on the range where they will be taken to market. There is the usual personal conflicts among people. Will the conflict be settled peacefully?

Rage at Dawn 1955
This color movie is the true story of the Reno Gang from southern Indiana. Their looting, killing, and burning was similar to Quantrills Raiders. The Pinkerton Agency sent an undercover agent to get information. He pretends to be a train robber to get their trust and set a trap. The Reno brothers are caught and receive a severe punishment.",1396224000,,1259,4.957345971563981

210261,5,6300158888,"Vengeance Valley,  Burt Lancaster, 1951

The old ""Cain and Abel"" plot device is redefined within Western terms in MGM's Vengeance Valley. Burt Lancaster stars as ranch-hand Owen Daybright, who has been raised as a son by rancher Arch Stroble (Ray Collins). Stroble's natural son Lee (Robert Walker) has always been envious of Owen, who in turn has spent most of his life pulling Lee out of trouble and keeping the boy's misdeeds a secret from the elder Stroble. When Lee fathers an illegitimate child, he tries to shift the responsibility on Owen, leading to a life-threatening confrontation with the vengeance-seeking brothers of the baby's mother (Sally Forrest). There's plenty more plot twists before virtue finally triumphs. Joanne Dru co-stars as Lee's long-suffering wife Jen, who harbors a secret yen for Owen.

A good, classic western nicely restored. Great audio and visual quality remastered by DigicomTV. A great watch for the entire family! I high recommend this interesting film featuring a young, handsome Burt Lancaster!",1387670400,2,1036,5.304878048780488

210269,3,6300158888,"A Colorado cattle rancher (Ray Collins) has two sons. A natural son (Robert Walker) who is a shiftless wastrel but married to a decent woman (Joanne Dru) and an adopted son (Burt Lancaster) who is honest and loyal. When the married son fathers a child with a local girl (Sally Forrest), her two brothers (John Ireland, Hugh O'Brian as two of the most incompetent bad guys ever seen in a western) come to find the father but the girl won't tell. Essentially a domestic western rather than a traditional western, the film is Cain and Abel in the Old West. It's rather routine with no surprises. We know from the start the predictable journey the film will take and that's just what it does. Walker's character is so obviously a worthless ne'er do well that you know it's just a matter of time until he goes too far and all his enablers will stop covering up for him anymore. He seems to be practicing here for his next role, Bruno in Hitchcock's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Unenthusiastically directed by Richard Thorpe and nicely shot in Technicolor by George J. Folsey (FORBIDDEN PLANET). With Carleton Carpenter and Ted De Corsia.
