around the world.  Good job from Playboy videographers.  Very Sensual
that will arouse every man's imagination.",1374969600,,185,5.777777777777778
7930082,5,B000053V5D,"A nice look at a dozen all nude dancers performing on stage in front of live club audiences. Good lighting and decent camera angles make it something to enjoy watching, the use of multiple cameras to capture most of the action plus quick back stage interviews give you a hint of each girl's personality so they aren't just a series of beautiful bodies",1354665600,,351,4.587301587301587
7930083,4,B000053V5D,"""Playboy"" quit making videos in 2009, but I find some I missed at ""amazon.com"". This one sounded good. I already own one ""Playboy"" video with sex stars and some videos with strip routines from Hot Body, and I figured this one would be similar. Some of the girls are very sexy and have sexy scenes stripping on stage for crowds of men. I don't recall the names of the girls, but I'd like to see more of a few of them. I can take or leave the helmet camera guy or the brief interviews. Strippers are fantasy girls, so what they say in interviews can ruin the fantasies we have about them. I've seen pretty and sexy girls in ""Playboy"", ""Penthouse"", etc. who turn me on ... until I learn that they're totally incompatible with me from reading the profiles, e.g. some girls love Rap, and I hate it, so I couldn't bear to live with a girl who ever played such (C)RAP!",1316390400,2,861,4.288343558282208
7930084,5,B000053V5D,"Playboy Strip Search Backstage is what a strip club would look like if it was made in heaven. There was lots of light to see everything on the main stage and lots of multiple cameras angles. There were cameras suspended from cables strung over the stage, and the cameras would go from side to side. There were cameras on booms going up and down to give us a bird's eye view or a front row seat by the stage. And there was the Helmetcam guy sitting at the stage.
  My favorite of the actual performances was Amanda Love. She entered from the back of the stage, paused for a second to stamp her feet and sashayed to the front twirling a whip in her right hand. She had the best music of anyone, too. She probably made it a point to request to the producers of the DVD that she be allowed to strip to a song of her choice. Amanda Love is sexy, energetic and has natural showmanship. You don't learn that stuff in a book. Either you have it or you don't, and she has it. I love it the way she flops her long hair around. A lot of girls, and even a lot of strippers, don't realize that long hair is one of the sexiest & prettiest parts of them.
  Speaking of music, other than Amanda Love, the music  was somewhat mediocre. It probably costs too much for the producers of these DVDs to pay all the royalties needed to get the best rock bands, best singers, etc.
  And, oh yes, let's not forget the interviews with the pretty girls backstage in Strip Search Backstage. They were an All Star selection of honeys, but we didn't get to know the names of a lot of them, and a lot of them never went on stage. One blond (...people keep asking me if they're fake, but they're real...), never did get on stage other than for a second or two.
  I would recommend Playboy Strip Search Backstage. It is a  Must-Haves for afficionados of the genre of strip club & strippers DVDs.",1207612800,,1862,4.219718309859155
