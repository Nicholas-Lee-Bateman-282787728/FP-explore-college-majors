8381146,5,B002U8723S,"""Barry Manilow Close Up!""  should have the title changed to ""Close Up AND PERSONAL"" because we get the most personal glimpse of Barry the Performer in this video than in any other he has released .. EVER!  This video is from his 1996 tour of the UK.  He played multiple cities in England, Scotland and Wales.  Every show was captured in it's entirety, then the best segments from each night were edited together to give the feeling of one concert.  The result is an experience of the most hysterically funny moments as well as the most emotionally moving moments of the entire tour.  And for each segment a graphic appears to tell us which city the piece was taken from.  That should be reason aplenty to buy this video, but there are many more reasons.  The camera that captured this video each night was located very close to the front row.  The viewer gets the feeling that you are practically sitting on the stage because there are some super close-up shots of those oh-so-blue Barry eyes and those infectious Barry smiles.  But the video is not just all face shots.  We get to see the whole Barry, too.  Like when he's feeling a little frisky and does a strip tease  to ""Sweet Heaven"" ... yes, I said strip tease.  It's more  ""tease""  than it is ""strip""  but his playfulness is adorable.  And one night when he just sat and chatted about his recent experience taping a talk show in London.  Barry starts telling a story and when he's forced to say a slightly naughty word, he cracks himself up and has the audience roaring. And his hit songs?  In this show those  hit songs seem just a little more powerful than usual.  And there are a LOT of hits, most of them performed in their entirety with the music swelling as Barry is belting out that gut grabbing lyric like only Barry can.  Then the pin-drop silence when he sings ""You're There"" with an impact that brings some to tears.

I should remind you that these shows were shot with one camera.  It's the same camera that shows the live action on those giant TV monitors in big arenas.  A typical professionally filmed  Manilow concert for video release will  use 3 cameras or maybe more.  And those 3-cameras probably have the most sophisticated optical lenses and capabilities.  This video doesn't match that level of technical perfection.  But it still looks great, even on a big screen television set.  And there is something to be said for the emotional intimacy between Barry and his audience.  It comes across very well in this video.  Perhaps it's because those professionally engineered concert tapings change the emotion just a twinge. There are cameras everywhere, and lighting changes, and occasional comments from the director or the sound guy; and when both Barry and the audience know it's being captured for video release the atmosphere isn't the same.  This video is the most relaxed and it does the best job of giving that ""being there"" feeling.",1386288000,,2919,4.6568627450980395
8381147,5,B002U8723S,"I was blown away when I saw this video recently. The showman of a generation belted out an array of hits, standards, and a few uptempo songs to make any Manilow fan very happy. This is Barry at his sexiest and he was oozing with a charm that would melt any beating heart. He may belong to America, but the UK has a grab on him that cannot be denied. The fans there are just wild and he is eating every morsel and giving it right back. We all benefit from this master showman and sensational singer. His vocals just blow every song out of the park; Barry did a snazzy rendition of Count Basie's Don't Get Around Much Anymore along with the unforgettable As Time Goes By; his vocals are superb and the entire show is loaded with snippets of humor and Barry is just delightful. The Full Monty segment with the Sweet Heaven I'm In Love Again is adorable. I recommend this for anyone with great taste in the magical musicianship of the magnificent Barry Manilow.",1379980800,2,957,4.382022471910112
