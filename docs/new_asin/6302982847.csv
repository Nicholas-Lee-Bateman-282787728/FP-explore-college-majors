7833225,5,6302982847,"This is a great upper body workout! Each exercise is on a time limit rather than # of reps, so you can pace yourself to work up to the maximum. You will work chest, shoulders, triceps, biceps, lats, and more! Very thorough. Tony is motivating, but not too annoying. There are two women in the video who don't say a word which is a plus in my book. Warm up and cool down included. I think the whole workout is 40min. Worth the money.",974764800,12,432,4.154761904761905
